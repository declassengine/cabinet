This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.3THE CABINET.POSSIBILITY OF A TURKISH OFFENSIVE IN NORTHERN IRAQ.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to CP. 3395, I circulate a memorandum by the General Staff on the possibility of a Turkish offensive in Northern Iraq.L. W.-E.\The War Office,-   21st November, 1921.1. The situation in Iraq was reviewed by the General Staff on 12th October, 1921 (OP. 3395), and it was then stated that the menace of Nationalist Turkey from the north and north-west is probably the greatest danger that we have to face in Iraq. Since that date this menace has been materially increased by three important events, namely : (a.) The cessation of active operations between the Greeks and Turk? in Anatolia. (6.) The conclusion of a treaty between France and the Kemalists, giving the Turksthe control of a large area of country south of the Sevres treaty line, the .  use of the Baghdad Railway to Nisibin, and the town of Jeziret-Ibn-Omaron the Tigris, north of Mosul, (c.) The conference at Kars, by which outstanding questions between Turkey aridRussia were settled as to the frontier between Turkey and the CaucasianStates, and to the policy to be followed in connection with these states.2. The military result of these three events is that part of the Turkish forces hitherto contained by the Greeks, French and Bolsheviks has been freed for opera-tions in other theatres.3. Turkish extremist aims in the East include the recapture of all territory which belonged to the Ottoman Empire in 191.4.The programme of the Pan-Islamic Party includes the withdrawal of the British in Iraq, and a return to the pre-war boundaries of Turkey,The Sheikh-el-Senussi has been employed by the Angora Government in extensive propaganda on the northern frontier of Iraq for over a year.The elimination of British influence in the East has also been the foundation of Bolshevik Eastern policy for some time, so that the Turks could count on Bolshevik support in any operations which would help to further this policy, though a serious attack by the Bolsheviks themselves is considered unlikely for the reasons outlined in the General Staff paper of 12th October (CP. 3395).An attack on Iraq by the Nationalists would therefore be acceptable to both the Pan-Islamic Party and the Bolshevik Party, while it would also be not inimical to the French aim of setting up a great Kurdish confederacy under Freuch patronage, and the embarrassment of King Feisal in Iraq.The Nationalists know that we have withdrawn our troops from Persia, and are in process of reducing our forces in Iraq. They still regard Great Britain as the chief obstacle which prevents them from obtaining the peace terms they desire, and they may, therefore, wish to bring pressure to bear on us by military means. This could be done either in Constantinople or in Iraq. In Constantinople they would come into conflict with the French and Italians, a situation which they wish to avoid. In Iraq they would not do this; on the contrary, they would find themselves opposed by Feisal, to whom they know the French object.If, therefore, Mustapha Kemal decides on military operations against the British, it is apparent that the Mosul Vilayet is the objective which he would choose.   &apos;Whether he would be wise from a political point of view to launch an offensive against us is a question on which the General Staff is not qualified to express anSECRET.CP. 3494.
opinion, but the point the General Staff wish to make is that from a military point of view there is nothing to prevent him from doing so.4. In order to arrive at the number of troops that may become available for such an operation, a brief survey of the distribution of the Turkish Nationalist forces on 1st, November, 1921, is given below : (a.) The Greek Front. The Turks have 21 infantry and 4 cavalry divisions, with a total of 50,000 rifles and sabres and 165 guns, opposing a Greek force of about the same number of rifles and sabres with 360 guns.It is unlikely that the Turks will be willing to weaken this front to any great extent, but if they wish to withdraw troops it is considered that they could dispense with 5 divisions, say, 12,500 rifles, leaving the balance to contain the Greeks. It seems certain that the Greeks will be unable to conduct any further offensive operations for some time, and the Turks would run no risk in withdrawing this number.If the Greek operations ceased, a further 27,500 rifles and sabres and 90 guns would become available. (b.) In Cilicia the Turks have now about 6,000 rifles and sabres on the French front, with 30 guns. This force could, if necessary, be increased to 10,000 rifles and sabres by bringing units up to strength ; of these 2,000 would be sufficient for garrisoning Cilicia, and the remaining 8,000 could be used elsewhere.(c.) On the Eastern Front are 4 infantry and 1 cavalry divisions, with a strength of 10,000 rifles and sabres and 100 guns, In view of the recent amicable agreement with Russia this force could possibly be reduced by half, making available, say, 5,000 rifles and 32 guns.(d.) In General Headquarters Reserve and in the Central Army area are 5 divisions and possibly 1 cavalry division. Two are still required for internal security purposes and to deal with Kurdish risings, but it is estimated that 3 divisions could be made available, say, 7,500 rifles and sal ires and 16 guns.(e.) In the Nisibin Bitlis area 3,000 rifles and 8 guns are available.5. A summary of the estimates given in paragraph 4 shows that under present conditions the Turks could raise troops as under : ...                                                                                  .&apos;         &apos; Rifles. G-uns.(a.) From the Greek Front............ 12,500 60(6.) From Cilicia   &quot;................         8,000 30.(c.) From the Eastern Front.........         5,000 -   32(d.) From General Headquarters and Central Reserve         7,500 16(e.) From Nisibin Bitlis area...       ...       ...       ...        3,000 &apos;     8Total      ......       ......       36,000     1466. Assuming, therefore, that the total number of Nationalist troops that could be made available for an offensive is some 36,000 rifles and sabres and 146 guns, it only remains to examine the question as to whether a force of this size could.be moved to the Mosul frontier, and, if so, whether it could be maintained there.7. The movement would be carried out as follows : (a.) From the Greek Front to the Nisibin area runs the Baghdad Railway. Although the Nationalists have obtained the right to transport troops over this railway, it is presumed that the French would not allow Turkish troops operating against the British to rail through their territory; it may, therefore, be assumed-that the Turkish troops would rail from a point south-east of Afium Kara Hissar to, say, Islahiya, a distance of 460 miles, whence they would either march to Nisibin, 320 miles, or perhaps march to the railway at Jerablus, 118 miles, and rail to Nisibin, 200 miles. Assuming that there is only sufficient rolling stock for one division at a time with the necessary supply trains for the force, it would take about 7 weeks to concentrate five divisions in the Nisibin area, though the first division cnuld get there within a month. &apos; It is believed, however, that two divisions could be moved at a time, in which case five divisions could be concentrated in less than 6 weeks. &apos; (b.) The troops from Cilicia, the Eastern Front and the Central Reserve could reach the Nisibin Jeziret area by road within a month.
APPENDIX. From General Headquarters, Egypt, to War Office.(No. 5976, cipher.   G. 1.) 12th November, 1921.French Deputy Chief of Intelligence in Syria has disclosed, apparently uninten-tionally, that three army corps were recently concentrated by Angora at Jeziret-Ibn-Omar.Details will be telegraphed when received.From the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(No. 667.) 12th November, 1921.Feisal and all intelligent Iraqis here, except pro-Turkish elements, are a good deal alarmed at news of French treaty with Angora. In a letter to me to-day Feisal recalls that be repeatedly warned His Maj-.&apos;sty&apos;s Government when in London of danger involved to Iraq in conclusion of such a treaty which was even then rumoured. Now that it has come about he (?) points out emphatically menace involved and impetus which the treaty is sure to give to Turkish aims and propaganda against Iraq, and presses urgently for a definite pronouncement of policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and a clear reply on problem of defence already referred to you.I do my best of course to discourage premature apprehension, but we cannot wonder at their uneasiness. I therefore beg to be kept as fully informed as is practicable of developments as regards treaty question and to be favoured at earliest possible moment with decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter of military responsibility.8. As regards supplies, two lines of s apply would be available : (a.) From railhead at Nisibin via the desert road, 120 miles. This road is passable for all traffic in dry weather, though some ot the bridges and river crossings would require repair and preparation for lorries.(b.) From Diabekir via Jeziret-lbn-Omai by river. Rafts can be used on this stretch of the river throughout the year ; the journey of 335 miles takes from 4 to 20 days, according to the state of the river. River transport was used extensively by the Turks in the Mesopotamian campaign, and they understand it well.The Nationalists would, no doubt, experience difficulty in collecting supplies at their advanced bases, but they can draw on large tracts of fertile country, and in view -of the fact that they have managed to feed and supply a very much larger army on the Greek front, when deprived of railway facilities and without river communications, it is considered that they could maintain this force in the field in the Mosul Vilayet.9. Conclusion: (I.) The General Staff is therefore of opinion that in view of the stalemate on the Greek front, the treaty concluded with France, and the arrangements made regarding the Eastern frontier, the Nationalist Turks are in a position to concentrate an army against the Mosul Vilayet if they wish to do so.(2.) The number of troops that could be made available is estimated to be as follows : (a.) Without reducing the number of troops on the Greek front : 23,500 rifles and sabres and 86 guns, which could reach the Nisibin Jeziret-Ibn-Omar area from their present positions within a month.(6.) Including five division-! which could be withdrawn from the Greek front without any risk : 36,000 rifles and sabres and 146 guns. This includes the force in (a), above. The whole of this force could be concentrated in the Nisibin area within 7 weeks.(3.) It is considered that if operations take place against the British in the Mosul Vilayet, the Nationalist forces will be considerably augmented by tribal levies.(4.) The possibility of such opi rations taking place is confirmed by two telegrams recently received from the General Officer Commanding, Egypt, and the High Commissioner in Iraq respectively (vide Appendix).
