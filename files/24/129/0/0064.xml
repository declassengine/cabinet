/    J   JThis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s ft&amp;verrimerit.SECRET.CP. 3463.3THE CABINET.THE MILITARY SITUATION OF THE GREEKS AND TURKS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff with copy of the telegram from General Headquarters, Constantinople.L. W.-E.The. War Office,Srd November, 1921.1. In our paper of the 31st October, 1921 (CP. 3434), we came to the conclusion that the Greek Army was not capable of forcing a decision upon the Turkish Nationalists, that the Greeks have nothing to gain by contimiing operations, and that the best course open to them is to commence peace negotiations immediately, using such territory as they hold to bargain with before its loss is risked.2. This opinion was based on the assumption that the arrival of winter precluded the possibility of offensive operations on. a large scale, which would necessarily be deferred&apos;until the spring. The attached telegram from Constantinople indicates that such operations are not altogether- out of the question. The Greek Army, for various reasons, is not in a position to take the offensive, and is compelled to adopt an attitude of passive defence strung out on a long front parallel to its communications. Strategically this is a bad position, since a serious reverse might compromise its line of retreat. In general the telegram reinforces the view of the General Staff mentioned above, namely, that the best course open to the Greeks is to commence peace negotiations immediately, before they have suffered a- further set back with accompanying loss of bargaining counters.H. W.,Chief of the Imperial General Stajf.3rd November, 1921..(No. 1238, cipher.) 2nd November, 1921.Following for General Harington.   Your No. 90014, 1st November :-1. (a.) Although report of 50,000 deserters is without foundation all reports show Greek troops now discontented with regime and discouraged by result of operations. Moral of army in Thrace in particular is deteriorating rapidly and may be taken as indicative of what may later be expected in Anatolia.(&amp;.) Unless ordered away or subjected to serious Turkish menace, supported by actual pressure, accompanied by attack on communications, Greek Army will stand.(c.) In spite of weather conditions, serious operations can be carried out. Alilshan,,-who escaped from Malta, is a brilliant and experienced commander and is considered by Turks to be a better man than Ismet. In view of his experience against Russians and Generals Maude and Marshal on Persian frontier and in Jebel Harorin districts, he is particularly qualified for severe winter operations.Since his escape, he has been given command of Turkish 1 st Army, composed of 11 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions, which are being grouped against Afiun Karahissar. Operations in this locality are expected by Greeks and according to our best proved agents, attack there by Ali Ishan is imminent. &apos;(d.) Yes, guerilla warfare will be organized by Turks, but will be subsidiary to organized operations based on Konia Afiun Karahissar railway.(B21/349)   100   11/21   HAS, Ltd.   9542wo
(e.) Unless forced to do so by attack, or for political reasons, Greeks will not retire further east (sic), as present line ensures a united front, which one further back would &apos; not.2. Fighting strengths. Greek. Johnson on 30th October reported 69,000 as front line rifle strength for 12 divisions in - Anatolia. This estimate we consider high. Johnson has to take what Greeks tell him. We have other sources of information and place Greek rifle strength for front line purposes as being about 50,000.Turkish. Present rifle strength of Turkish Western Army stated by our best informant(s) to be 56,000, but this will be increased by 29,000 by advent of three strong divisions now en route from Eastern front and Kemalist Anatolia, and that by 1st January another 15,000 will be added by drafts from depdts, bringing total up to 100,000 rifles. This estimate we consider high, and estimate present rifle strength at 48,000.This number will be raised to well over 60,000 by such of above reinforcements as are at present accepted as likely to materialize. What is probably a more important factor than any slight numerical superiority is the determination and experience of Turkish commanders, combined with ascending Turkish morale.3. At meeting of Generals on 25th October, General Charpy was asked whether French military assistance could still be relied oh against Nationalists, if necessary.He was obviously embarrassed by question and replied by saying an agreement only had been signed by Franklin Bouillon and that its ratification by French Parliament was still required.Concrete information is lacking, but effect of agreement is immediate French withdrawal from Cilicia and Codom(? ini)um along Baghdad Railway, military use of which is to be accorded to Turks. This military policy is hardly compatible with military opposition to Nationalists elsewhere.Question must be influenced by French military budget for Syria about which it is believed War Office have information. Any operations against Nationalists would also render impossible French monopoly of (?) Aleppo.
