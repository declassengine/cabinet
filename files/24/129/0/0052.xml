Murphy has admitted in &quot;Tho Worker&quot; that the British Bureau the Red Trade Union International was financed hy Moscow.The result of the ballot of the shipbuilding and engineering unions the proposed bonus outs is esrpooted to he knoviin to-morrow.There is grave unrost in the coalfields and sectional stoppages, the event of further drastio reductions, cannot he ruled out.There is further ovidence concerning the widespread plat of the sh Self-Determination League to steal and transport arms and iloslves to Ireland.There is no change in the situation in   Ireland, where the Irish ublioan Army is still preparing for war:   de Valera&apos;s telegram is ireuted by many Sinn Eoiners as had diplomacy at a time vshen silence d have been the best policy.r 1According to Roderick Connolly, Irish oanmunists are in direct kjh with Moscow,
TWIfflffLOYBP /For the weei ending October 14th there was an increase of 8,032 in the number of registered unemployed-,; the total being 1,384,800.     In addition,there were 580,108 persons who had exhausted their insurance benefit, 308,032 short time workers on the live register and 45,455 who had esrhausted benefit. rThe National Administrative Council,of Unemployed has arranged to hold a national conference in J&amp;nehester on November 21st, 22nd and 23rd:   the draft agenda covers ratification of the national demands&apos; for work or maintenance at trade union rates, area organisation, tactics, national no-rent strike end election of the National Administrative Council. In a circular letter aoc ompanying the draft agenda Baye states that the Council is in debt to the extent of 2105 for flags end that provincial committees have in many, cases not paid for -  &quot;Out of Work&quot;.   Hayo- Sruair, Landau, Mrs. Thring and. other officials are very depressed as. the finances of the International Socialist Club, as well as of the London District Council, are at a low ebb:   three of the five billiard tables et the Club have been taken for the rates.Demonstrations in London have for the most part been poorly attended and site organisers are reconsidering their usefulness:   it has, however, been suggested that the unemployed should go. to the West.End at night, presumably with the idea of stealing.      There are rumours that the unemployed will endeavour to create a di stur vi an ce at the Cenotaph, on Armistice Day.There is dissension among the unemployed committees in the Metropolitan area.     The two Kensington committees are still at variance regarding street collections:   according to a statement made by Bollen on October 24th, 00$ of the money goes to the individual who collects it and 15$ to theorganisation, while 5$ is used for the alleviation of distress.Reports/
Reports received from various parts of the oountry indicate much opposition, on the part of the workers, to the 3) proposed unemployment levy:   a good deal of labour and communist opposition is also expressed towards the proposal to limit wages for relief work to 75$ of the local rates of pay. The comment in labour circles is th&amp;t the Government is &quot;taking advantage of the poverty of the men to underpay them.&quot;LAN OA ships &amp; OHSSHIRSMy correspondents report that on October 14th the totally unemployed In Lancashire and Cheshire numbered 213,033 end thst of these 120,000 had exhausted their State benefit.   Deputation of unemployed have visited the Guardians at Harrow, Birkenhead, Salford, Preston and Wlgan.   There is a slight iixprovement in the cotton trade and a good demand for textile roaohinery in the Blackburn and Aocrington district, but otherwise the position In the engineering industry is worse,   repression is acute in the mines and few of the colliers are working more than three days a week.   Within the last few days great activity has been I shewn at the Liverpool docks.   Big arrivals of iron and steel 1 castings, earthenware and corrugated iron sent by rail from    1 inland plaoes, havo reached the port for export.   The fruit season is in full swing and the Dock Board employes are all on full time, whilst the coeJ. appliances are busy:   at the gravid docks carpenters, boilermakers, sealers and painters are actively engaged on repair work........ &apos; .&apos; IThe organised unemployed in Liverpool have been somewhat quieter since they were granted the use of the Stadium and although large meetings are held daily, little enthusiasm is apparent:   on October 21st, for instance, Braddock appealed for 50 volunteers to sell the hewart . J. Vint Laughland&apos;s paper &quot;Justice for All&quot;.   Only sixteen men volunteered although they were to receive 7d. for every doaen sold....... IDURHAM &amp; UORTHUMBSHLANDIMeetings of unemployed v^re held during the week at South j Snields at whioh Alderman Dunlop was the chief speaker:   he is j an extremist shipyard driller, who has been out of work far some time and is&quot; urging the unemployed not to pay rent.   My correspondent has heard hint, tell naval and military men that they should be ashamed of the uniform they were wearing.In Newcastle, Gateshead, Tynemouth, Sunderland end Mlddlesborough members of the unemployed committee are stands as municipal candidates.YORK SB TBSThe unemployed in Sheffield are much quieter although thej general feeling is sullen-   the Government proposals have been well received as a v&amp;ole but there is muoh opposition to the suggested)
MIDLANDS(There is little alteration in the unemployment situation in the Midlands as a whole, but relief on generous scales is being given and there are no signs of immediate disorder.   The local . authorities are, however, muoh perturbed regarding their liabilities and fear that if rates are further increased people will not be able to pay them.   My correspondents state that the proposed levy is being severely oriticised by employees and employers and that Labour propaganda to the effect that the Government should provide the whole of the money necessary for the maintenance of the unemployed is gaining ground.In Leicester the situation has eased considerably and the provision of work for  ,000 men under the Guardians&apos; schemes has temporarily stopped demonstrations.   The civic authorities appear to have dealt with the matter in a very efficient way and 148 business firms are making a weekly contribution to the Mayor1 s Fund:   about  3,500 has been oolleoted.   Robert Harvey has returned to Birmingham but two Sheffield agitators have been sent to Leicester by the National Administrative Council of Unemployed:   they visited Nottingham on Dctober 23rd and persuaded the local unemployed committee to affiliate to the National Council.   When asked if they wished to make a collection during a meeting, these men replied in the negative and said that their organisation had plenty of funds and that they only desired to organise the unemployed into a fighting body.   The unemployed in Nottingham complain that their relief is being out down each week and there is friction between ex-Service men and civilians, owing to the alleged preferential treatment of the former.The Coventry Guardians are at a loss to know how to provide funds for relief:    3,230,14.3. was paid out during the week-ending October 15th, but it is hoped that this amount will be reduced when State benefits are resumed.   My correspondent states that at the present rate of progress it seems unlikely that any large number of unemployed will be absorbed for some time.   The new extremist unemployed committee has, so far, gained little hold.In Birmingham the agitators appear to be losing hold and in two or three instances last week efforts to form district committees failed.   On October 22nd, Brain gave vent to his annoyance with the unemployed in the following words:&quot;We have had three meetings this week.   The first meeting our collection amounted to 8-jkL.   The second meeting 6-i-d, and to-day it is 4d.    I say &apos;to Hell with you all.&apos;   Here we come out to fight your cause, and when we ask for your support, you give us 4d,   How ;the Hell oan we carry, on these meetings.   It has cost us 2/lOf- in chalk. ,  Our banner cost us 9/6.   We are lo/6d. in debt, end you give us 4d.   You ought to be b.....well ashamed of yourselves.1/suggested scales of pay for relief work.In Leeds the unemployed committoe is devoting most of its attention to the assistance of individuals who are obtaining relief which is alleged to be inadequate:   in Bradford the position appears much less aoute.   A deputation of the Ruddersfield unemployed has oomplalned to the Council that necessary public work is not being done and the Halifax unemployed are protesting against the reduction in wages for relief work.
I will send our comrades round again with the hats, and for Christ&apos;s sake, help us?&quot;-The second collection realised Sl-d. ^There is much looal opposition to tho unemployment levy, the workers contending that, in view of. wage reductions and short time, the workers in employment should not he further &quot;penalised&quot;.     Labour members&quot; of the City Council have contested the proposal to limit wages for relief work to 75$ of the existing rates so vigorously that at one time thex-Council1s schemes appeared likely to be vreoked.On October 21st the unemployed in Smethwiok.demonstrated against the ejectment of a man who had not paid his rent and a threatening situation was relieved by a clergyman, who paid the outstanding amount.   Wakefield and Mrs. I^Lat^ery of the  -National Administrative Council of Unemployed, live in Smethwick and this demonstration was the direct outcome of their propaganda.SOUTH WALESOn October 22nd an unemployment conference at Cirdiff was attended by delegates from labour organisations, trades councils, co-operative societies and unemployed committees. The usual Labour P&amp;rty resolutions were passed but the chairman, T. Richards, refused to accept an amendment demanding that   b. conference of South Wales trade unions be called to consider a general strike.   Consequent upon his refusal a number of the unemployed delegates left the conference.Daily demonstrations aro still being held in various parts of the South Vveles coal field but the audiences are diminishing.SCOTLANDEfforts are being made to amalgamate all the unemployed N committees in Scotland but there is controversy as to   &apos;     &apos; whether headquarters shall be in Glasgow or in Edinburgh. On October 24th unemployed delegates from Motberwell, Paisley, Springb urn, Mary hill&quot;, Corbals, Garngad, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and from the Scottish Divisional Council of the Communist Perty of Great Britain met in  ipringburn to discuss this matter and: arranged to call a national conference at-a later.&apos;date.David ICirkwood is running an energetic &quot;No-rent&quot; campaign in Glasgow and succeeded in creating a &quot;disturbance in the Town Council on October 20th.    John McLean&apos;s followers have been chiefly occupied in attempts to procure witnesses. . for his trial to prove&quot; that he is opposed to violence.There is general opposition to the nrop6sed wages for relief work and the leaders of tho unemployed&apos; in the mining areas are exhorting their followers to refuse ^&quot;ork unless trade union rates are paid.The increasing number of applicants for relief Ab causing grave concern to the smaller Scottish Parish Councils.According/
According to reports received, about 30,000 people have attended demonstrations during the week in the following placos: Batteraea (6), Bermondsoy (2), Binning ham (5), Bootle Brixton, Camberwell (3), Clapham (&amp;), Goran try, Eccles, Glasgow (4), Gateshead-on-Tyma, Hammersmith, Huddorsfield , Islington, Kensington (2), Kilburn, Liverpool (5), Newcastle,, Shepherd1 s Bush  3), Shored itch, South Shields, Southward, Springburn, St. Eelen&apos;s (3), Stockton-on-Tees (3), Stratford (2), Sunderland , Walham Green (4), Warrington, Widnes.COMMUNISTSThe Municipal Elections are engrossing the attentioniof the Oommunist officials, who are distributing large quantities of the manifesto which appeared in the current issue of the &quot;Ccmmunist&quot;.    As an example of their activity in this direction it may be mentioned that on October 22nd. J, Crossley, the Lancashire organiser, borrowed a car and visited Old ham, Ashton, Stalybridge, Altrincham, Harrington, Liverpool, St, Helens, Leigh, Sarieatown, Wig an and Tyldesley, leaving election leaflets at each pi ac a.Greonoclc, Paisley and Motherwell, each of which is running twj Communist candidates, have applied to Headquarters for 5,000, 7,000&apos;and 5,000 leaflets respectively:.   In Glasgow. John MacLean^s group has Joined forces with the&apos;Gcramuniet irarty for election&apos;7mrposes aafl Mac Loan and Mc Shane ars twD of the candidates;   20,000leaflets have been ordered from Headquarters....In certain d istri cts: Communist candidates are opposing labour men. an?, tbo result in B3mon.ton has been that neither oar&apos;:;; has yaineS a seat:    in Coventry a good deal of ill-feeling has been caused by the candidature
of Tom Dingley and A. Graham in wards which tho LabourIJOBParty is contesting.The lahour Party and the Independent Labour Party hdffisenjt official instructions to all Glasgow branches to theeffect that they must on no account affiliate with theCommunist Party.The &quot;Famine Department&quot; of the Communist Party has issued the following circular to all branches:&quot;The Party Famine Fund has now reached a total of  2,000 hut though this amount represents much hard work on the part of the membership, it is not nearly enough.   The bourgeois relief organisations ail giving no indication of any 6 as ire to help to alleviai tho famine mit-t**y   and because of this tho workers must rally with even greater vigour to the assistance of their distressed Russian comrades.&quot;We outline below one or tvo suggestions for further activity;1, &quot;Make application to the local police authority for permission to hold a Flag Day or a general street collection. We are prepares to obtain flags for this purpose at 2l/- per 1,000 for quantities up to 15,000 For 50,000 the varies is only 10/6 per thousand.2.     &quot;November 6th is the anniversary of the Soviet Revolution and this day should be sot apart for spec! meetings and demonstrations on behalf of the Famina Fund...3.     &quot;Collections of jewellery.   The Russian Communis Party are haad ing over for the Fund such jewellery as they may possess and are calling upon other parties to do the same.   We know this will mean a real sacrifice, but the sacrifices that the Russian have i on behalf of the world revolution are infinitely greater.4.     &quot;Famine Badges - The sale of these badges should be pushed as vigorously as possible.   Money already i: hand should be sent to the OffiCe without delay.   We have still a quantity left and further orders will be executed by return of post.&quot;1k special circular has also been sent to communist branched in mining areas urging them to collect coal &quot;so that it ma] be included with shipments of other commodities from this country.&quot;Some of the communist officials are discontented witb the dictatorial attitude of the group which controls &quot;$hsCommunist&quot;:,
ramunist&quot;:   Arthur Siffleet, who has apparently had an articlefooted,complains to  MaoManus:&quot;1 thank you for your kind advice to got busy with *all other papers1.   Only communist papers print communist articles.     Such papers are three - &quot;Communist&quot;, &quot;Worker&apos;, &quot;Dreadnought1.    Of these, as a loyal member, I am primarily oonoerned with the first - our pap or - more so as I helped to build it, and to a greater oxtent its predecessor, tho &quot;Call1...    The &quot;Dreadnought1 I considered merely as a vahiole for stuff rejected by OUR paper.&quot;I do not impugn Comrade Postgate,s right &quot;interpret1 anything: but, Comrade, I like a sound roason for rejection: none other makes for confidence, goodfeeling, or in the long run efficiency.&quot;As my interest has .always been mainly in the Party Prose, I feel this question keenly.   Present arrangements do not appear to,me calculated to brine; out the, best elements of the&quot;P&amp;r.ty.   They do not accord with the Theses.     Our publications are practically inaccessible, being the kept preserve of a cliche.&quot;Despite the lamentable deflection of energy that should be directed to the common  foe , I am not standing for this kind of thing so long as 1 am in the P&amp;rty,&quot;Kehrbahn, who has been abroad frequently of late, appears have secured the post of english secretary to the Russian operative Bureau, which is functioning as a sort of teraational company for wholesale purchases:   he has already de enquiries regarding a large consignment of goods apparently quired for the Red   Army.. ... :There is a good deal of oommunist activity in Plfeshire t the owners of cinematograph halls are not permitted by the cenBlng Authority to let their premises for meetings on days without the sanction of the police:   the Chief Constable quires a guarantee from the speakers that no unconstitutionalInguage shall be used at such meetings and thAt the polioe shall allowed to be present.   In connection with the guarantee the oal secretary of the Communist Party lias reported to. Robert tewart at Scottish headquarters:&quot;We are preparing to fight this to the utmost hut in the meantime we are up against it as far as getting a hall is concerned.   If you oan see your way to write a pious note disclaiming any intention of being unconstitutional 1 will pass it on to the polioe so that they will either nave to give a blank refusal to the use of the hall or alternatively give us a permit.&quot;and/
and&quot;An individual guarantee is req,uirod from eaoh speaker hut if you jould append signatures of CTallacbar and Bell you could mention in your raply to me that through a fortunate   oeincidence the other two happened to ho in the Glasgow Office when this letter was received .COMMUNIST POLICY FOR THE MINERSJ.R. Wilson has reported to MacManus that the South Wales&quot;Polioy Committee&quot; haB completed its work and has furnished acopy of the proposed &quot;Communist policy for tho Miners&apos;Federation of Great Britain.&quot;The following extracts are taken from this document, theprinciples of which are litely to he aooepted &quot;by the Party:&quot;BMSDME policy the Consolidation of the M.ff.G.B....We must assist in getting the M.]?.C-.B. baok to its pre-lookout strength.   This we can do in three ways.(a) By killing the movement now afoot to get oraftsmen to secede from the M.F.G.B.,.(b) By checking and ultimately abolishing non-unionism from the Coalfield,..(o)    By advocating a policy of industrial unionism.   The question of the industrial union for the mining Industry depends on our ability to abolish the microbe of craft unionism.   The basis of the union must be the industry -91 mining, and every person that works in or about a mine, mustbelong to the one union - the M.P.G.B.Problem of the Unemployed.All solutions short of the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a Workers1 Republic will be mere palliatives, probably raising more problems, graver than those they attempt to solve... The one outstanding thing that suggests itself to us is&apos;that a stop must be put at onoe to , all.or any overtime at in or about the mines.   It isIntolerable that suoh a thing as overtime is allowed to exist at all at a time when thousands are wanting work and are starving along with their helpless wives and kiddies.   The other things we ought to take up with vigour at once is the advocacy and putting Into operation of a 6 hour day and a 5 day a week policy, In order to absorb the surplus labour now a drag on the mining labour market.,.oWe have no hesitation in advising the unemployed to beoome: burdens on State funds and looal bodies that are so indifferent to the welfare of their industry.   By all means we must discourage the short-sighted, cap-in-hand policy adopted by some localities of making sporadic pit head collections only for tho unemployed*M.P.G.B./
M.P. .B,. and the Lockout Agreement ana the Mining Industry Act... As oommunists we must see to it that all agreements and customs that were in vogue in the coalfield are maintained oven if a fight over the matter is called for.   Wo rust not yield up the non-Union clauses or the overtime agreement.A close watch must he kept on the proceedings of the N.W.B. Pull use must he ratio  of the disclosures contains&apos;] in the District audits.   Monthly ascertainments must he explained where possible in M.:&apos;ss meetings.   The full significance of the new principle of apportioning profits and surplus profits as a fixe? ratio to standard wages must be explained.   Comparisons, however,odious, must be made between district ascertainments to show the pernicious working of this district basis in contrast with the abandoned truly national wages board operating a national pool of profits.     Statistics should be kept of the concerns that are shut down during the existence of this agreement as some more nails in the coffin of capitalism.     Particular note should be made of the process of trustification on a national and an international scale that is proceeding so rapidly under our very noses particularly since the lockout.Now that it is part of the adopted policy of the M.F.G.B. to work the hitherto tabooed Mining Industry, we must get all we can out of the Act, especially as we know that the management and owners have already articulated their intention to torpedo the section of the Act which gives- the miners the. thin end of the wedge of CONTROL through Pit Committees.     Because the Boss STLass don&apos;t want it, let us see they get It, fAll power to the Pit Committees&apos; must be our cry.   See that the proper men are put on them.   Let them be class-conscious rebels and not toadies that will bow end scrape to the Boss Class.     Clause 20 with its provision for the Minors&apos; Fund needs careful handling to provide Pithead Baths and so-called Welfare schemes.   By all&apos;means let us have clean bodies and virile minds but there must be no side-tracking of our young men from their loyal activities as Trade Unionists.   Reform must not lead to Reactionaryism.   We must make use of their clause to secure for miners good institutes with reading rooms, study classes in social science and well-equipped gymnasiums - all to one end - to produce clean living, class-oonscious rebels against the exploiting, class.Attitude to bo taken towards reactionary industrial and, political leaders&apos; and&apos; thoir&quot; adhereno&quot;.? to yho&quot;  apVicf tn5]I::na;&apos;;ional.    -Communists must follow-/with, keen interest the press and platform utterances of these anti-Rod or Yellow leaders, usually M.P.&apos;s, J.P,-r3 and O.B.E&apos;s. that love to ape the Boss Class in dress and ideas.These industrial satellites are generally hirelings of ths     ( capitalist press rather than hard working unpaid contributors to the lahour press.   We must ceaselessly expose these big guns and their false ideas and shallow piffle...We must get a weekly or monthly journal circulating through the British coalfield focussing attention on the problems of the coalfield.   Till a separate journal is obtained, special pages of the &quot;Communist&quot; will be devoted to the M.P.G.B. and coalfield matters.   These will be reprinted and sold later as cheap pamphlets. Discussion should be provoked around these articles regularly in the coalface and in the lodges...ULTIMATE POLICYAll the above activities must in the end help to achieve the * goal/
goal far tho exploited wage-slaves - the Communist  /orkers&apos; republic...The structure and constitution of all alliances Cripple&apos;, Triple and Multiple must he perfected so as to prevent the glorious inactivities and paralysis of -31ack Friday.In regard to the ultimate policy ro unemployment we must raise the war-cry th: t the mining industry must hoar its own unemployed,   Kote how, not the wage earners employed to keep the unemployed.   We know th-.t the ^neconovaic1 character of such a policy will he emphasised hy its critics, who desire that oapiialism shall have another lease of life, hut the employed and : the unemployed of tho coalfield must not worry shout the &apos;*&apos;Economic of business1 side of the policy.   Our idea is not mere business.The unemployed miners., most of. than being tho most active Federationists, are deeply&apos;concerned with the indifforonce which the M.f.G.3, has displayed towards them.   This coupled with the treatment that they have received from the government has made the unemployed desperate.   Thoy are now turning&quot;to the K,P,.G,3, and demand the t it, takes up the question of forcing the owners of the industry where they formerly were, and \ifaere millions of pounds of profits were made, to shoulder their responsibilities and maintain those v/ho aro unemployed through no fault of their own.   This maintenance should he on the sane monetary basis as the wages paid to the employed.     If the coal industry on its present basis of capitalist anarchy cannot fulfil its obligetions to the unemployed, y;hich it has created, then it is not for us to stand idly by and let things drift.   We must articulate the feeble cries of the starving wives and children of the unemployed and. if necessary organise the mining industry and all other industries on the basis of a new economy so that it will be able to meet its obligations to the unemployed..-as well as the employed.*   .  All unions, locally and nationally, must be linked up inone solid international phalanx against capitalists^ by affiliationwith Moscow1 a Third Iiitirmtional.&quot;EHE RED INTEHUTIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONS*T*T. Murphy, who appears to have no position in the   re-constituted British Bureau, possibly as the result of the accusations made against him at the Moscow Congress, (vide my report No, 112), admits in tho current issue of the &quot;Worker&quot; that &quot;most of the expenses of the old Bureau and the initial work in general have been met hy the Red International.&quot;    In point of fact Moscow gave the British Bureau some thousands of pounds while less than  50 was contributed from British sources.3fforts are now being made to place the Bureau on a self-supporting basis and a soale of affiliation fees for trade union branches and federations and for Trades Councils haB been drawn up:this/

Only 14 people responded to the call to march tothe American   Bmbassy, so the march was abandoned.It is reported that the agitation against the sentence onSacco and Vanzetti is being run by the Industrial Workers of theWorld end not by the Communist Party, although individualcommunists, who are members of the Industrial Workers of theWorld, are participating.the &quot;DiilLY HERALD&quot; AND- THE) INDEPMDM LABOUR ?.:.3TyThe &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is making g^reat efforts to obtain subscriptions for its &quot;Back to 16&quot;.campaign and articles written by prominent tr^ade union officials are appearing daily. In the current issue of the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; Philip Snowden &apos;complains/ *
complains that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; haB circularised all ^Indopendent labour  arty branches and that,&quot;She directors of the &quot;Dally Herald1 must have obtained by sane means the private branch directory, and usoC it to reach our branches, although it is clearly printed thereon that it must not bo used to solicit money from the branches.&quot;Snowden adds til.-; t&apos;  Ltlidu^h ha deplores ftny&apos; difference with the directors of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,&quot;It is most regrettable tbAt they should have approached our branches in this way without any request or intimation to the National administrative Council, and especially at the moment when we are asking our members give all they can spare to our own Special Effort Fund. v!q need money to enlarge the size and reduce the price of our p.-?per, the. &quot;labour&quot;&quot;Leader1.

The &quot;Daily Herald&apos; has a big field to exploit in the six million Trade Unionists, end if it can induo3 half of this number to contribute a sum equal to a month&apos; subscription to the Independent labour Party it will get all the money it needs.   I expect every Independent labouf Party branch and member to put the Independent Labour Party first in their support.&quot;L-33RVI0E MENThere is great discontent among ox-Service men in Woolwiolj who are or have boen employed at the Arsenal, owing to the alleged retention of war entrants and women:-   this applies especially to the work now being carried on by women and girlsat the Small .,rmg Qartriage Faotory, No. 6 Royal Laboratory Department.My Midlands correspondent reports that the unemployed ex-Service men in his area are very despondent and believe that one is taking any interest in their position:   they do not apptf to be well organised and say that although they read of the existence of funds to provide work for them they are not able * obtain their share.    Last week a deputation of the Coventry a District Joint Council of ex-Service men interviewed the Mayor of Coventry, who gave them a willing and sympathetic hearing bilwas
was obliged to tell them that, as business pr expositions, their schemes for employment&apos;were useless.INN FEIN IN GRJATj BRITAINThe plot to steal and transport arms and explosives to Ireland, to which reference was made in my last report, is developing rapidly.   There are now eight men&apos; and two women under arrest, all of them officials or prominent members of the Irish Self-Determinatlon League.   The documents seized supply ample proof of a &quot;wide spread and deeply laid conspiracy under the direction of Mam Mellowes, Director of   Purchases for the Irish Republican Army, &apos; ; *The chief agents were J.i. Oonnolly, of Cardiff, Irish .Self-&apos;J)etermination League organiser for South Wales;- Gilbert Barrington, of Newcastle, Tyneside organiser for the Irish Self-Determination League; and Richard Purcell, a well-known Irish Self-Determination League speaker and a prominent Labour --man-, also of Newcastle;   Eamon Fitzgerald, M,A,, a Sinn Fein writer and speaker of repute, ana P.

IRELAND, There is no change in the situation in Ireland, De Yajl telegram has caused some consternation and heart-burning but generally speaking, the Sinn Fe ins rs have condemned itnotl much on account of anything contained in the telegram itsallfrom the 12th Lancers stores at Tidworth Camp, and the explosiv,, seized at Newcastle have &quot;been identified as those stolen from a magazine at the Bobside Collieries a few days previously.   Thogi found in the possession of the Evans   at Merthyr are part of s stolen - two days previously from a local colliery magazine.   In these cases the arms were stolen during the night.A meeting to commemorate the anniversary of the death of Terence KcSwiney was held in Trafalgar Square on October 23rd. Art 0&apos;Brien presideC, and was supported by J. Fowler, Pilchmoncl; Councillor Scurr, Poplar; Michael Hannigan;. Alder man O^eil, Ot P.J. Kelly, Liverpool; and Dr. Bernard 0&apos;Connor.   About 2,500 persons wore present:   all the speakers urged their hearers to fight on until the ideal for which McSwiney died is achioved and called for the immediate release of all Irish prisoners and internees. ,,Sinn Feiners in Great Britain account for the language used in de Yalera&apos;s telegram by saying it was intended not so much for the Government as for the large number of people in America and elsewhere who have given him the fullest&apos;support, There is also, they say, the &quot;human&quot; side:   do Yalera has boe much in.... the baokg round lately a.nd probably does not like it... Scottish Sinn Feiners are still quarrelling among themselves.    Sean O^heehan, the organiser, who appears tomace many enemies, has just been reprimanded by the Secretaifl. to the Sinn Fein Cabinet in the following terms:-&quot;The Adjutant General reports, that you in your capacity as organiser of Sinn Fein   in Glasgow.-are interfering with the Military side of the work.     If ytfl . ,want to work on the Military side, you had bstkoaa &quot;appljf the Minister of Defence, through me, for instructions..&apos;
&quot;but because it was a bad diplomatic more at a time when silence would.bare been the best policy.&apos; . It was, reported tba^ de Valera was forced by the leaders-&apos;of the Irish&apos; Republican Army in Ireland to. send the telegram, to the Pope&apos;bee&amp;uso in $he event of fur.tb.er hostilities they would be treated as,rebels and not as&apos; belligerents unless\thoy publicly announced allegiance to the King. &quot; &apos;: &apos;-&quot; 1In the meantime the activities of the Irish Republican Army continue and there are reports of special snipers being told off to shoot members : of .the Gro&apos;wn Forces;   batches have bean .told off for ambushes and for sabotage.     &apos;i correspondent reports that failure of the peace  \, negotiations is almost certain to be followed by reprisals in^england and that Collins has been organising and arranging for this purpose while in London.When &quot;in London last week, Collins obtained an order to visit a prisoner at Wormwood Scrubs:   he was reported to have arrived there under tbo influence of liquor.    Since his visit one of the prisoners ho visiteel has become troublesome.Some unpleasantness from Boland and hie Irish-American friends, directed against the British delegates, may be expected.Captain White of the Citizen Army is now in the north and has been financing Roderick Connolly to start &quot;the Workers Republic&quot;. ;QJlie Irish Republican ....rmy end the Ulster Volunteers are showing increased activity in the Horth.Connolly is considering the starting M a Young Communist[league in Ireland:   he is at present acting as Irish&quot;correspondent of &quot;The Communist&quot;, at a salary of  8 per week andrecently wrote to 1?.   .?eet, the acting secretary of the CommunistParty of *reat Britain:&quot;It is unfortunate th-t Comrade KecKrnus is not at present in London for he would be able to acquaint you exactly as to bow I became connected with the paper.

As a matter of fact in May or June -I oannot recollect the exact date just now as I am busy with the paper - he sent over Comrade Page Aroot, or when tahis comrade was here empowered him to receive a report from me, I being then the seoretary of the Communist groups. In any case I sent on an official report to him then, and since - until it became patent from the non-ackhowiedgmsntg that be was not xat home - have complied with his instructions as to reports.   In my reference to Comrade Gallaeher I mentioned that he had not come to the communistb thereby meaning the groups who. are directly affiliated to the Third International.   It seems strange that you are not aware of these groups being an affiliated body.   Ho later than a fortnight ago one of our delegates have returned from Moscow.1   Comrade MaoManus was aware of this and one report acquaints him of the sanding of the delegate.&quot;
