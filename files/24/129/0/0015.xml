(THIS. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY? S GOVERNMENT) , SBC H E;T.CP .-3415*0 -A B I NE T*COMMITTEE.ON UNEMPLOYMENT, IMPERIAL.&apos; DEVELOPMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT,Moro*-randum by the Secretary .s.f state for the Otlsnies. :With refaronce&apos; to&apos;-C.U. -2&apos;68;   Sir.James Stevenson has submitted &quot;to ;&apos;me that: thoro.;:is- another aspect&apos;of Imperial Develop mont &quot;which has an important bearing upon the&apos; immediate placing of ^rdefd&apos; in this country, and which I desire -te&quot;bring prominently .to.&apos; the attention of - the. Cabinet.In reviewing-development proposals.for both the Colonies and Protectorates, I have ascertained that, there are a number of useful works (so homes...for whlelr-havo been prepared) which cannot be proceeded&apos; with&quot;:owing to tha /difficulty of raising funds&apos;. &apos;There&apos;:aro Colonies..in.a less, advanced stage of development which, oven;lf they were, in a position to raise loans on the London market,,could not for an indefinite number of-years afford the.necessary expenditure on interest,, nor could they impels .any more, taxation to   provide for it. , .-.Again,- there are protectorates which, a re equally unable to afford the-interest on -loans within a measurable period&apos;,: and- in addition suffer under. the. disadvantage that thoir loans would not be- Trustoo Stocks, owing to the refusal of the Treasury to aa^ifePr^tectc rates to the benefit of the Colonial Stohk^;Aet*:v. -^These.prcteotorates, therefore, would be unable..toY raise&apos;.leans, vf or public works on satisfactory terms,, even.&apos;.if:fthey:-cculd^otherwisa afford to do so.Thirdly^, thoxerare.*- mthe Co 1 oniob, municipalities and other- independent&apos;:unofficial bodies not, under tho control. Of the- Secretary, of. State for. tho Colonies or of the Colonial Government.,, whioh have before thaiti projects for public, works of a useful
character, but cannot be stimulated to incur the necessary expenditure without some substantial lnduce-ment.     Also the sum involved, though large from the point of view of the borrowing minicipality, Is too small for a public loan in the London market and could, therefore, only be raised on very onerous terms here, and would In certain cases, If raised at all, be raised in Canada or the United States, where the orders would consequently be placed.The net result Is that a number of useful works are shelved, and orders which might be placed in this country are lost*       In many cases, the details of the schemes have been worked out, plans have been prepared, and the only obstacle to the placing of orders here, is that the Colony or city concerned cannot or will not Incur the financial liability.A schedule is attached illustrating such wOrks, the total cost of which Is estimated at  7,868,000^ in respect of which orders could be placed In this country to the total value Of about  4,000,000.It is submitted that the present circumstances justify the expenditure of Imperial funds on such works.      A large amount of work would be provided In this country without delay, for it would, of course, be a condition of Imperial assistance that any plant or materials required should be ordered in this country. The works would benefit the Colony,develop markets for British goods, and enhance the purchasing power of individual inhabitants in the Colonies with future benefit to British trade.
There aro various ways In whioh the Imperial (Jovornment could afford financial assistance to the carrying out of these BOhemes, such, for example, (l) as advancing the money free Of interest for a Certain period of years,   or   (2) an undertaking to meet the loan charges for two or three years,   or   (3) a direct contribution f.p to a oertain proportion of the total cost.  - Each oaso would require to be considered on its merits, and before submitting proposals as to the form which assistance should take, it is necessary to know whether such proposals would he favourably received, and to what extent funds oau be made available for the purpose *(Initialled)COLONIAL OFFICE.17th Ootober, 1921.
