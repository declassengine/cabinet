THE UNEMPLOYED

On October 28th the live registers contained 1,611,476 names as compared with 1,423,792 on October 21st: a large proportion of the increase is due to the fact that persons who had exhausted their 22 weeks benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act have restored their names to the live registers in order to qualify for the second period of benefit, which came into operation on November 3rd.

There has been a very distinct decrease in the number of unemployed demonstrations and in the number of persons participating. This is due to the colder weather, the resumption of the unemployment grant, the measures taken by Boards of Guardians and the permission in same cases to use halls for meetings or committee work.

The most important meeting in London was held in Trafalgar Square on November 5th to demand "work or maintenance at trade union rates of wages and the release of John MacLean, a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, now serving a term of imprisonment." Contingents of unemployed numbering in all about 1,000 marched from Battersea, Bethnal Green, Bexley, Camberwell, Clapham, Deptford, Lambeth, Southwark, Stepney, St. Pancras, Streatham, Wandsworth and Woolwich and were addressed by Bishop, Hannington, Pollitt, Steele, Lyle, Vincent, Frank Smith, Tom Mann and Ex-Inspector Syme. The speeches were of no particular interest except in the case of Lyle, whose remarks have been submitted to the Director of Public Presecutions.

In Bermondsey the unemployed appear to the quite satisfied/




\satisfied with the relief grantee! by the Guardians hut \ at Shepherd,s Bush about 200 unemployed demonstrated outside the Board of Guardians on November 2nd:   they sang the &quot;Red flag&quot; and hooted any person whom they believed to &quot;be a Guardian;   a deputation was informed that the Guardians were unable to do anything more for the unemployed at present. .    .Mrso Thringg who led a deputation of women.to Downing Street on November-2nd, is attempting to organise the unemployed women in London as a separate body and has announced her intention of requesting a personal interview v/ith the,Prime Minister through the London District Council of UnemployedeUnemployed committees in tho provinces are doing their utmost to pre vent, the execution - of relief works at less then trade un ion, rates and in a few cases small strikes have followed systematic picketting, cveral :rincmplcyed&apos; candidates were&apos; put forward at the municipal elections j, but-met with very little success, two. of the exceptions being Mrso flattery, a member of the National Administrative Coxiricii.of -.&apos; Unemployed and W,A.

International Socialist.Club, and special enquirie into the matter are being made.On November 7th Fred Peet, who is still acting as secretary to the Communist Party in plaoe of Inkpin, sent an urgent circular to the communist organisers in which he stated that the Party is at the present time &quot;passing,through, a very serious, finanoial crisis&quot; and thalj tho position makes it absolutely essential that the responsible officials of all departments should reduce expend 1 tare to the loweat level consistent with efficiency.     In spite of this circular, however, Scottish headquarters have received their   usual weekly allowance, of  12.10,0. for expense and all salaries are still being paid in full.The&quot;national organiser has complained that ^ranches are not making   their monthly reports and he considered it necessary to remind branches that the ports on of members1 contributions due to Headquarters or divisions must not be used for general branch purposes,! He has further stated that report sheets must in future be returned to headquarters, within seven days of their receipt-by lie branches,   The Divisional organisers on the other hand do not appear to hold Headquarters organisation in high esteem:   Crossley for instance, has informed Bell that after - checking his divisional accounts for the year he found that &quot;the whole account has been bungled by the responsible officer at the Head Office&quot;,,and made the same charge of bungling against thePublications Department,    ,&apos;a ;On October 28th Arthur McMrnus and Fred Peet sent a &quot;Famine Report&quot; to Vienna, in which they stated thatthe Party had. collected, to date,  2,230.     They addedthat/
that the Labour Party generally had not yat donemuoh but that., as a result of continue a representationby MaeMunus, the Trade Union and&apos; Labour officials had issued a manifesto to their members (ride &quot;DailyHeraid &quot; of October 22nd):    they hope to raise maneyfor the fund by street collections but permission tocollections but permission to collect in London hasbeen refuses.

TEE COMMUNIST;-; AND THE UNEMPLOYEDThe Communist Party is making every effort to gain complete control of the forthcoming national conference in Manchester:   area organisers have Eeen instructed to summon preliminary conferences of communist delegates as &quot;it is very necessary that a line of policy should be arrived at prior to the conference.&quot;    Squair, of the London District Council, is to address these preliminarymeetings.Tom   Bell, the national organiser of the CommunistParty, has issued the following circular regardingthe national conference to all branch secretaries:&quot;OOMMQIIISTS AND UNEMPLOYED AGITATION&quot;(Guiding principles for members and groups)&quot;The following leading principles are set forth here :for the guidance of Party members in their activities amongst the Unemployed organisations. Circumstances of course, are variable in different districts towns or villages and members must therefore use their fundamental communist ideas to help them in their estimation&apos;of the local situation.   The main thing to keep in mind is that the workers Unanployed and ^employed must be made to feel that -the communists are not mere visionaries but are capable of offering ultimate revolutionary objective.&quot;BO/1EDIATS DEMANDS&quot;(1) Given an unemployed committee or organisation in which of course the communists are active, deputations should go to the Board of Guardians, Town Council or equivalent body and demarri a scale of financial relief equal to the average trade union rate for the District,     In no case to be below the National demands of 1he Unemployed Committee,-   Receipt of this not to entail loss of citizen rights.(Where /position:     the latter has reported favourably on the branches at Aberdeen,, Dundee, Kirkoaldy and Perth, but found friction at Cowdenbeath and little activity at Lochgelly and BowhilL:   at Methil he found no branch and suggested that the local communists should join up with Buekhaven,

All suoh workers to Join the respective unions[ and works committees and to retain contact with! the Unemployed Committee),&quot;(3) Te the question of &quot;How to find the money1 the deputation should demand that the Council -(a) Refuse to levy rates for outside bodies. :  ; :    In instances where local bodieis are compelled to raise levies for outside bodies these should be met by a blank refusal.(h) Oppose the principle of loans or interest en the same.-    -(c) Increase the assessments on business premise)(If Council is obstinate then demand a Towns meeting ard follow lines as in number one. Where there is a labour majority who refuse then no effort should be spared to discredit ....   them, and secure support for the Communist Party policy).&quot;RELATION OS1 TRAD!

THE RED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONSThe following is the text of an Important communication sent by Losovsky, general secretary of the Red International of Labour Unions, and Schaplro, head of the Department of International Industrial Federations from Moscow on October 13th to Tom Mann, who is now in charge of Red International ef labour Unions* propaganda in Great&apos;Britain4and the Colonies;. 1lWe aro now fully facing the question as to what the International Committees of Propaganda and Action are to ao right now and what tasks they are called upon to accomplish.   In view of the&apos;latest developments within various branches of industry, it is imperative that we give all the possible attention to this line of our work.   In Western Europe we have reached the stage of taking up special organising work. In England, however, where our Influence is comparative-ly slight, our Propaganda Committees have a wide field . for action along the lines of agitation and, propaganda.&quot;We have now decided to open in Berlin, in connection with the Central European Bureau, a special section for International Industrial Federations, as a connecting link and point of transmission between the Red Labour Union International and the 15 Secretaries of the International Propaganda Committees and their members in various parts of the globe.   Having in view the relative strength and the interplay of the factors operative in the various industrial labour organisations of the world, wo have decided to, call for December next a number of conferences in Berlin by separate industries. In view of this, we should arrange for having revolutionary English unions and their minorities represented at those conferences.   Out of the 15 Propaganda Committees organisec&quot; here during the First Labour Union Congress there were comparatively very few English representatives.   Most of the.Committees have no English representatives at all.   The Propaganda Committees of transport workers, printers, builders, chemical workers, teachers, leather workers, textile workers, farm hands, food workers and municipal workers have-not a single English representative.   .&quot;Comrade J.T. Murphy, It seems, accomplished very little.   Comrade J. Strain, of Glasgow, member of the Woodworkers&apos; Propaganda Committee, has likewise failed to show any signs of life.   Comrade N, Watkins, to our sorrow has not, as yet, informed us of his, work.&quot;It is desirable to open a campaign in all large labour centres in favour of the Propaganda, and Action -&apos; Committees, explaining their aims and tasks; and creating a British oentre to consist of members representing various Industries capable of directing the&apos; work of the Prooaganda Committees in your country.The/
The existing orisis in England offers favourable grotmj towards the consolidation of the revolutionary workers the labour movement.&quot;It is advisable that sometime between Deoember lj and 20th delegates representing the minority groups in the following trades and industries arrive in Berlin: metal workers, builders, miners, transport workers, leather workers and printers.   The organisation of a Propaganda Committee among transport workers will prese a still more serious-problem for you in England thaaa ia the case in other trades.&quot;The recent Seamen&apos;s conference, which took place I Moscow, demonstrated the Imperative need of extending the influence of the Bed Labour Union International upon the work of the organised revolutionary seamen. The English version of the proceedings now printed in Russian and all other languages, will soon be forwarded to you for distribution among English seamen. In addition, in accordance with the resolution which we presume is already within,your knowledge, (if otbe-rwise, you will soon get it), we have decided to organise in large English seaports, Bureaux of Connection and Information for doing work among transport workers and seamen, and also in view of the fact that the German SeamenJs Congress opened in Hamburg on October 5th, whicl took up the question of organising&apos; a separate Seamen&apos;s International, we shall avail ourselves of the earliest opportunity of writing to you a special letter dealing with this question. BesCldes, we sent out, through the Berlin Bureau, a great number of letters, olrculars and appeals, which have so far not found their way into the : press, nor have most of them elicited any answer. We are starting a number of publications in connection with each Propaganda Committee, which will have to be brought out in foreign languages, including English. Experience has convinced us that I much work can be best done in each respective country, .&apos;&quot;A comrade is soon to leave here for taking up the work of organising Propaganda Committees abroad, who will keep in constant touch with you,&quot;Losovsky deals at some length with the InternationalPropaganda Committee in Bo. Z of tho Bulletin of the ExecutiveBureau of the Red Labour Union International dated September17th and published in &quot;tescow.   He writes:&quot;It is necessary to create within each international federation an amalgamation of revolutionary unions for the propaganda of the ideas of the Red International and to carry on intellectual combat against the oorroding influence of reformism and social-harmony tactics in the trade union movement.   Suoh Propaganda Committees were formed during the International Congress of Revolutionary Trade Unions.   Simultaneously with the sessions of the Congress itself and the, termination of its works, the representatives of the revolutionary unions of various oountries organised a number, of conferences of trades and industries and eaoh industry created its own Propaganda Committee.      There we nave International Propaganda Committees of metal building, wood, transport,leather/
leather and educational workers, miners, municipal workersprinters, chemical workers,agricultural end lumber workers and employees...&quot;The tasks and problems of the International Propaganda Committees &apos;are traced in the decision of the Constituent Congress of the revolutionary unions. This is what the Congress says on,this point in the resolution on the question of organisation (Section 6 of-the International Federation by Trade and Industry):27. &apos; 1 The Red labour Union International from its very origin took the view that revolutionary unions should remain within the International Federation of separate trade unions in order to conquer the above organisations.-  But&apos; as soon as Amsterdam had realised the danger of tho class unions being revolutionised, the Amsterdam International passed a number of decisions which it had first carried -through separate international trade union    &apos;organisations.   Aocording to the above decision, the necessary condition for admicaion to separate   . international trade union federations should be the recognition of the Amsterdam International, By these and similar doclsiona the Amsterdam International was ,the first &quot;to split the trade union movement by expelling from the organisation all those who declare -themselves in.solidarity with the International standing for revolutionary action and the ryjass&apos; &apos; &apos; Struggle.&apos; 1 &quot;    &apos; &apos;&quot;-28. : 1 The above decisions-compel the revolutionary olass unions expelled from the international organisations to unite in order to resist Amsterdam. Unwilling- to create new international organisations by  . trade and industry, without exhausting all means in order to struggle and work within the international unions, the 1st Congress of revolutionary class&apos; trade -unions recommends all organisations standing for revolutionary class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat to create International Propaganda Committees Toy trade and industry in order to rally the pulverised revolutionary foroes.   The above International Propaganda Committees are-in duty bound to carry&apos;on their work in all countries on the basis of the decisions taken by the first Congress of revolutionary trade unions by carrying on a resolute fight against class collaboration and bourgeois illusions about harmonious development.129.    TThe task of the.Propaganda Committees should not &apos; be confined to mere propaganda of the ideas of revolutionary clase struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat;   it is-also their duty to lay bare the machinations of the Amsterdamers who are.striving, for the sake of their own salvation, to split the large labour organisations.   The Propaganda Committees take the initiative of calling meetings and conferences, provide necessary literature, raise money, supply .- information to all revolutionary   unions on the ; situation in their respective branch of labour notifying them in advance of the strikes and conflicts to their place;7 fight international scabbing.   In short, they oarry out&quot; the genuine principles of revolutionary class struggle..1 . &quot; ;.
30.   &quot;Bach International Propaganda Committee ia connected with the Red lahour Union International through the agenqy of its representatives who enter in the Central Council : of the International with, a consulting voice,   All International Committees work, in close contact with and , .: under control ef the Executive Bureau of the Red labour    1 Union International.   The conferences and congresses organised by the Propaganda Committees meet after an , under standing with the Red labour Union International,1&quot;The new British Bureau has now been constituted and oonslsts of:   Tom Mann, chairman; Hat Watkins, secretary; E, Lismer and Harry PoHitt, organisers.   Owing to the ourtail-ment of Russian financial support tho propaganda of the Bureau is rauoh less extensive: than was the oase from February to September of this year but conferences are being arranged in Sheffield (Deoember 7th), Newcastle (December 10th),London (December 17th).and Glasgow (January 22nd).&apos;. 709 invitations to &quot;delegates&quot; have been issued to the Sheffield conference and 136 sympathisers have been requested to attend branch meetings and seo that the invitations are accepted:   Tom Mann will preside and resolutions dealing wi1h unemployment, wage reductions, extension of hours and industrial organisation will be debated,   .500 Invitations have, so far, be en is sue d for, the -. Ne wo as tie co nferenc e.Tom Mann has drawn up a leaflet setting out the object,organisation and tactics of the Red International of labourUnions in this country, and. the following is a oopy of theprinter1 s proof of this dooument:&quot; &apos;   - &quot;OBJECT   I&quot;The conversion of the Trade and labour Unions from being . co-workers with and supporters of the Capitalist System, to becoming Militant Industrial- Organisations for the purpose of.overthrowing Capitalism and the establishing of a - Socialist Commonwealth.,.-&quot;ORGANISATION&apos;      -&quot;The formation in each industrial district of a Local Committee for the purpose of conducting a propagandist campaign among the unions to get all branches and lodges in the district to affiliate with the Red. International of;      Labour Unions. &quot;. ;\-i        &quot;TACTICS-  I .&quot;We shall ever aim at industrial Solidarity on the basis of the Class Struggle; and shall be ready to work with all sections if and when the doing so is calculated to Advance&quot; &apos; &quot; uhe/
te; ac;the interests of the workers and the achievement of the Social Revolution.&quot;Every individual worker must belong to a Union and work to secure one Union only for each Industry.&quot;The Red International of Labour Unions v/orks in harmony with the Third International;   aver aiming ,at the Complete Control of Industry in every branch and department of production, distribution and exchange.&quot;Knowing that the capitalist system of production for profit is the direct cause of Unemployment, knowing also that the Capitalist Governments will never seriously attempt to solve the problem of Unemployment, we shall systematically agitate and organise for substantial reductions of working hours, and tho securing of adequate incomes as the best means of minimising the evil and at the same, time leading on to the real cure - a Communist system of Society.&quot;Wo urge Trade Union branches&apos;and lodges to affiliate without delay.&quot;Theaffiliation fees of Trade Union Branches or Lodges are 2d. per member per annum.   Get to work in the branches and secure affiliation at once.   We are definitely out for the abolition of unemployment, the abolition of the wages system and the establishment of a true Co-operative Commonwealth.&quot;Tom Mann has issued a booklet entitled &quot;Russia in 1921,&quot; which embodies his report as a delegate to the Moscow Congress in July of this year and quotations from the &quot;Laily Herald&quot; of October- yth regarding the Foreign Offioe Rote regarding breaches of the Trading Agreement.The British Bureau   is considering the issue of a six-page journal but at the moment &quot;The V/orker&quot; 13 still the official organ of the movement.
