Egypt (Status).Mr. Lawsori asked the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether, in view of the fact that the Egyptian people have made it clear to their delegates that they will not be satisfied with less than the abolition of the British protectorate and of the fact that the Milner Report does not exclude the possibility of this abolition, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to state their policy on this point.Answer.Mr. Harmsworth. His Majesty&apos;s Government have addressed the following-invitation to the Sultan of Egypt: &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government, after a study of the proposals made by Lord Milner, have arrived at the conclusion that the status of protectorate is not a satisfactory relation in which Egypt should continue to stand to Great Britain. While they have not reached final decisions with regard to Lord Milner&apos;s recommendations, they desire to confer regarding them with a delegation nominated by your Highness, with a view, if possible, to substitute for the protectorate a relationship which would, while securing the special interests of Great Britain and enabling her to offer adequate guarantees to foreign Powers, meet the legitimate aspirations of Egypt and the Egyptian people.&quot;551   [7172]B
