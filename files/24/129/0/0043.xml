Property of His Britanmc Majesty^ Government. ]280^ssssjJEj^ Document .-60&apos;MDENTIAL.Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.I circulate to my colleagues the reply which T propose to send to M. Litvinof&apos; s attack upon my former note (approved by the Cabinet), which called the attention of the Soviet Government to their repeated violation of the pledge about propaganda given in the text of the Trade Agreement.I should not have desired to continue the correspondence were it not that M. litvinof, in his reply, deliberately challenged the truth of the statements contained in my former note, and declared them to be either forgeries or fabrications. Silence in answer to such a challenge would be held to imply acceptance of the charge, or at least inability to meet it.I have made my reply as precise and concise as possible, and it should be issued without delay.Foreign Office, October 27, 1921.DRAFT REPLY TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT.IN their letter of the 7th September His Majesty s Government complained that the hostile activities of the Soviet Government against British interests in the East and elsewhere continue unabated, and added that they are in possession of indisputable evidence that these activities have been due to the direct instigation of the Soviet Government.In his reply of the 27th September M. Litvinof declared that the charges contained in the British note were either unfounded or were based on false information and forgeries.His Majesty&apos;s Government had not made these charges without a prolonged and careful investigation in each case into the sources of their information sources which it is necessarily impossible in many cases to disclose. They see no reason,to recede from or even to qualify a single one of these charges now. Nor would any further statement have been required, were it not that specific allegations have been made by M. Litvinof in his rejoinder which it,is necessary to repel.It is impossible to accept M. Litvinof&apos;s attempt to dissociate the Russian Government from the Third International. That the Second International should have included in its executive such men as M. Vandervelde or Mr. Henderson isN wholly irrelevant. On the other hand, that the Third International, established in Moscow under the protection of the Russian Government, from whom it draws constant support and resources, should include in its executive MM. Lenin and Trotsky, the two most prominent members of the Russian Government, establishes so close an identity between the two bodies that each must be answerable to charges against the other. Moreover, the procedure adopted in this case has long since become familiar. When the Russian Government desire to take some action more than usually repugnant to normal international law and comity, they ordinarily erect some ostensibly independent authority to take the action on their behalf. So it was when at Russian instigation the Tashkent Government destroyed the independent Khanate of Bokhara ; when Russian troops, under the mask of the Azerbaijan Government, occupied a province of Persia ; when Azerbaijan itself demolished the Dashnak Republic of Armenia; and when Armenia in her turn attacked the State of Georgia. So it is to-day, when, through the Third International, the Russian Government seeks to spread its propaganda throughout the world. The process is familiar, and has ceased to beguile.His Majesty&apos;s Government acknowledge one error in their note of the 7th September.&quot; A quotation was made from a speech by M. Lenin stated to have been delivered on the 8th June. M. Litvinof has denied the delivery of any such speech. It was in fact delivered by M. Lenin on the 8th July, and the words quoted in the British note were actually disseminated broadcast to the world by the Russian official wireless news from Moscow.   Further, none of the information on which His Majesty&apos;s0. of K.552 a   [7174] a
\\Government based their note of the 7th September or on which Lord Emmott formded his report was drawn from &quot; Ost Information,&quot; as conjectured by M. Litvinof. They have better and more reliable sources of information. Lord Emmott&apos;s report was based in the main on official Soviet publications supplied to him by the Soviet delegation in London or, in a less degree, received from Russia direct.His Majesty&apos;s Government knew long since that M. Nuorteva had been found guilty of malversation of funds ; but they also know of the Bolshevik system under which persons under conviction for such an offence are permitted to remain at liberty at the goodwill of the local authorities. Whether he is or is not in prison, his condemnation does not preclude the presentation of reports on his work, as to which His Majesty&apos;s Government repeat their former statement. M. Eliavas appointment is, or was till recently, in the Transcaucasus. M. Stalin holds the post of People&apos;s Commissar for Nationalities, and in the last few days it has been confirmed that he is in charge of Eastern propaganda. Of none of these was it said that they belonged to the Third International- though the point is immaterial nor that they submitted reports at Moscow in person; their reports -were, however, quoted,, and as to the authenticity of these His Majesty&apos;s Government entertain no doubt.M. Litvinof denies that the Soviet Government has had any relations, direct or indirect, with Indian revolutionaries. This is not in accordance with the facts. The Soviet Government cannot deny the presence in Moscow of some twenty or more well-known Indian revolutionaries, invited to. Moscow by the Soviet Government itself, where they remained as its guests for a period of three months from the end of May to the beginning of September - attending various conferences, the object of which was to decide on measures for fomenting revolution in India. The names of many of those who attended these conferences are known.M. Litvinof returns little more than a general denial to the paragraphs in the British note concerning Persia, Turkestan, Anatolia and Afghanistan. The statements there made are, however, in the majority of cases a matter of common knowledge in those countries, where His Majesty&apos;s Government are not without excellent sources of information. M. Rotbsteins activities in Tehran, his subsidies to the Persian press and his expenditure on propaganda do not admit of denial. The fact that a Revolutionary Committee has not been set up in Tehran does not disprove the allegation, now repeated, that M. Rothstein advocated and M. Chicherin approved this step. Within the last few days a reliable eye-witness of neither British nor Russian nationality has confirmed the regular despatch of the so-called propaganda train to the East, and the continued printing of propaganda in all the languages of the Orient. M. Litvinof denies the concentration of troops on the Anatolian frontier ; yet the movement of such bodies of men cannot take place secretly, and reliable confirmation of the information was easily secured. The attitude of M. Nazarenus, the Soviet emissary to the Nationalist Government., is well known in Angora, and his activities in the direction mentioned in the note of the 7th September have been accentuated since it was delivered. The caravans of Russian arms on their way to the Turkish forces have been seen by reliable witnesses. M. Litvinofs references to the allegations concerning Afghanistan are particularly scanty ; there is a denial as to Russian assistance and co-operation with Jemal Pasha as to which His Majesty&apos;s Government, who possess unimpeachable evidence to the contrary, must retain their opinion. His Majesty&apos;s Government continue to take the strongest exception to the general policy of the Soviet Government in Afghanistan as being aimed against the interests of the British Empire ; and in particular they observe, as a further instance, that no attempt is made by M. Litvinof to disprove the purely propaganda purposes to be served by the suggested Russian consulates in Eastern Afghanistan.M. Litvinof signally fails to produce any evidence in favour of his counter-charges against His Majesty&apos;s Government. The latter have consistently and faithfully conformed their conduct and policy to the conditions of the Trade Agreement, and are entitled to insist upon a similar degree of loyalty from the Soviet Government. They note with regret that the assurances for which they asked that the Russian breaches of the agreement shall cease have not been forthcoming, and they are accordingly left to consider whether the conclusion of the agreement has in any material degree been followed by the mutual advantage which they had the right to expect.
