Herbert Smith and Vernon Hartshorn, M.P.Important seizures of explosives and ammunition collected by the IrlBh Self-Determination League ana intended for the Irish Republican Army have been made in Cardiff and Liverpool.The Irish Republican Army is gtill preparing for war.     5he only hopeful sign is that the Sinn Fein Courts are losing their popularity and that the farmers and business people are beginning to lose their faith in Sinn Fein.     Some of them may break away if no agreement is reached.
THIS UNEMPLOYEDThere is little change in the position of the* * *unemployed ft 1,376,768 of whom were registered, at tho Exchanges on September 7th;   including tboso whose unemployment benefit has ceased, the total is estimated,, at 1,750,000.demonstrations continue to be held In most parts of the country, but there is less enthusiasm probably because the genuine unemployed hcpe that steps will be taken to alleviate their position during the Parliamentary session.     The extremists are still active but there is division of opinion, especially in tho. London District Council as to the tactics which should be adopted:   one section advocates immediate violence, while the other holds that &quot;peaceful persuasion&quot; will be mere effective .  in the long rmu   .Elans had been made for a large demonstration, to befallowed by disorderly conduct in London, on October 18th:owing, however, to police precautions and to the factthat about two-thirds of the unemployed organisationsdeclined ta obey the orders of the London DistrictCouncil, only about 8,500 people marched to Hyde Parkfrom   Battersea, Lambeth, JPinsbury Park, Putney, Fulham,Stepney, Shored Itch, Bethnal Green and Hackney.     Theywere addressed by Bishop, Lyle, Warren, Steele, Lester,Hanson, and Harm ing ton:   the last named was careful to.announce that &quot;the London District Council says thisis to be a peaceful demonstration,&quot;Bishop said:&quot;We are not maintaining this peaceful attitude for inherent love of the police,&apos; but Decays3 we realise that it is not worth while for &apos; ona or two lud ivlluils to lay out one or twozcoopers3, I*rte thing we want to point out is this -that tho present time is not opportune for us to resort/
mm    g    mmrasort to those tactics for the simple reason that it would give the Government the excuse that it Is so anxiously waiting for to bring out the Police and the Military as well.   One or two men with   glass or bottl33 Or anything else would stand precious little chance, but the day is coming, and it is coming vory soon whan the unemployed will be sufficiently well organised not merely to hold their own, not merely to resist the brutal attacks by Crown Forces, but also for capturing for themselves the means of production auS distribution, and when that day comos and when there is a chance^ta, certainty of success, then there may be an entiisly different tale to toll.Lester, tho Canadian, said:&quot;If you had sense at all, any of you - policemen included - not one of you would bo here.   Whenever I see an unemployed procession with numbers of men marching through the streets of London, mon on horses in the front of you, and working men at tho side of you, ready to club one anotLor, it makes me feel inclined to laugh, and there is absolutely no reason for it if we only had any intelligence.   I am going to talk to you as if you were Intelligent human beings, trying to get you to realise the cause of this unomployment problem, and to try and get you to see what must be done in order to remody ita   The unemployed&quot; problem, if it is over to be solved at all, will have to be solved by the tuieinpl oyed thomsolresj and you must have the coinage to take the &apos; thing In your own hands ana&quot; donxt trust any politician, don&apos;t trust anyono but yourselves.   Tao Capitalist system is played out, and it does not matter what the master class does, they have got in a net not&apos;from which they cannot extricate themselves.   If you go before them and they ask you for suggestions, don3b give them anyc You tell them to solve ii9 it is their business and you will rub their noses in it until th6y aos&quot;Steele said:nU?he workers to-day are being driven to despair. Until the sluggish matter of the working class movement is removed and the great working classes throughout the country are prepared to get together in a great solid phalanx of labour. Capitalism will go on preparing their red and blue guards and turn cn you when you&quot;demonstrate and Semand the right to live.   It will ultimately coma to that point when we will be compelled as a natural law and a social lav/ to meet force with force, aifl that will be -the only solution to the great and enormous problem ivhich confronts the working class to-day, who are denied the right to live&quot;.It was noticed that a numbor of well dressed young Jews accompanied the Sast End procession to and from the Park and frco their conversation it appeared that they were ready to take part in any disorder that might arise;     It wasalso/
also observed that in the Wsst End shopping centres many-people gave half crowns and florins to the men who wore, selling &quot;Out of: tiork&quot;,    : &apos;   &apos;&apos; ,-George lsnsbt*ry^:&apos; speaking at a meeting in Poplar Town Hall on October 16th, &apos; said that&apos;he thought that it -would be an excellent thing if they could combine their, comrades in Bothnal Green&apos; and Staphey to organise a big demonstration In the West End of the wives&quot;-and children of the unemployed. Ho thought that-they could arrange j as they .did some years ago, to havo:- a&apos;&apos;meet-ing place in-the .%.st End where the &quot;worneh&apos; and children&quot; could ;rest; and have ;.a meal before returning home,:-&apos;i&apos;iii,f &apos;-thbre-wag--no-reason why-they-, should hoVuse the Borough&apos; vans&apos; &quot;and - earth-&apos; &apos;to - carry the children: such 3 emoii&quot; str a il on s&apos; vould^So^mucK&apos; -to- bring home: to people, in the West End the realities of the situation,...   Ix was of no Use for &quot;the unemployed to waste their time in fighting&quot;the Police or&apos; trying to capture Trafalgar Square, but so far as he&apos;&apos;khcw there&apos; was-&apos;nor objection to the ir. merely, marching through the streets of. the West End and he thought that demonstrations of that kind*did a lot of good.   They could not, however, expect people like himself who... were at work all,day to organise these things and it i was .up to the unemployed to do them for themselves, ;. -  .,;They must, also remember that the people now had political, power, the.power of the vote, and it was up to them..to use, that., power to return people of their own class to   represent.. them- in.Parliament and on the Borough Councils in order that they themselves might be able to control the political machine, ... One tiling vyas certain and that was that the present .state. of.thing could not go on much longer. Either-the working class must have,a majority to control- - * - Parliament/
Parliament, or Parliament would disappear. It was only by these means that unemployment would he done away with and a newer and brighter era created.Reports from tba provinces contain little fresh, information:   at the moment peaceful methods prevail hut cold weather or the influence of agitators may cause a chango in the situation.   As the various unemployed oommlttees link up they are becoming aware of the differing scales of relief, which give rise to much recrimination.It ie worthy of note that the Rev, J. Vint laughland, who has a large following in Liverpool and professes, in public, to be in favour of purely constitutional action, has written to Hays of the National Administrative Council of Unemployed:wI would suggest that as quickly as can be arranged this country be divided Into 5 or 6 districts and 2 delegates be appointed from eaoh to meet the Prime Minister and tell aim that if doesn*t soon open large schemes of work we shall force him and his crew to get out,,&quot;According to reports received about 47,000 people have attended unamployod demonstrations   during the week in the following places:   Abertlllery, B*,ttersoa (6), Birkenhead, Birmingham (2), Brlxton, Oamberwell (2), Cardiff!

THE COMMUNISTSHarry Webb, who is one of the most active forcesin the oommunist movement and receives a salary of  6a week from his Party, has drawn up the followingplan for the exploitation of the imemployedi1.        &quot;That with the growing intensity of the class struggle during the coming winter, and the probable arrest of many members of the Communist Party and also the possibility of an attack upon the Party, that consideration be given to the production of an elementary bookletB dealing with Police Court procedure, with special reference to advice as to the opportunities afforded to defendents when defending their own case.2,       &quot;Arising from the response, in many parts of the country to the efforts of communists for a &quot;Mass Party&quot; and such response coming at a time when the active membership of the Party is engaged on divers tasks and as a consequence cannot attend to the educational needs of the new members   to the extent required;   that Headquarters publish a pamphlet, giving concise definitions of revolutionary terms, also embodying in such &amp; pamphlet a considerable number of short sketches of WhoJs Who in World of Politics to-day.3.       &quot;That wherever there is an unemployed committee at work it should be urged that one of their most Intelligent members be instructed to glean from the resources of the Public library such data as will be useful to the different speakers from time to time,4.      &quot;Such efforts to be supplemented by information sent out from the Headquarters of the Party to local branches.     However, it is not sufficient that information should be sent down from &amp; National Centre.   The masses themselves must be taught how to compile data to suit their needs.5.        &quot;That wherever processions are organised amongst the unemployed it is the duty of comnrunigts to enlist the service of ex-se-rvicemen for this worJc, in order that the processions be organised in military formation.     This has the effect of thinning out the police forces, and also gives a good impression to the onlookers en route.6.        &quot;It should also be noted, that the use of ex-soldiers amongst the unemployed helps to counter the. efforts of those, who are anxious to use   ex-servicemen to break up communist meetings.
7.      &quot;One of the most important needs of the Iunemployed throughout the country this coming winter U is the need for an indoor meeting place, v-here a Pprogressive educational and organisational campaign can he carried on hy members of the Communist Party, and where such a meeting   place has not been secured by the unemployed, it is the duty of the communists to urge them to take steps in making representations to the local authorities for this purpose.     The first step in this direction, is to endeavour to prove to the I local body, responsible for the letting of a large hall for a meeting place, that it would be in the interests of Law and Order to grant such a concession to the local unemployad.     It would then be the work of the local branch of the Communist Party to turn such a concession to the advantage of the Party.8.        &quot;Wherever a meeting place has been secured for the unemployed, communists should immediately consider the necessary ways and means of maintaining the interest of the unemployed by the organisation of    I concerts, games, etc., in the midst of which the necessary propaganda work could be done.     In the latterI connection, cere should be taken to send out invitations to the local labour organisations to send along their speakers to address the unemployed, and then it would be the duty of communists to exploit every refusal or evasion, and in the event of aooeptance, to get the Communist position put before the audience, preferably after the refozmist position has been stated. i.9.       &quot;In districts where the local authorities have     I instituted Relief Work, which only absorbs a small percentage of the unemployed of the district, it is the duty of members of the Communist Party to agitate against this policy, especially where such work Gnly...covers a portion of the week.10.      &quot;Wherever unemployment has reached an acute stage, and there is a need for a committee to be formed, members of the nearest Communist Party branch should urgently consider the possibilities of the establishment of a communist branch in-this district so that the fruits of agitation and propaganda amongst the unemployed may be garnered in terms of revolutionary organisation.11.       &quot;Wherever there are more than one unemployed committees in existence, it is necessary that point of contact be established with a view to the fullest mutual assistance, and wherever possible a district council should be formed, whose chief function would be to ascertain the best methods of organising the unemployed of the whole district.     Such a council could also warn districts of tactical and organisational mistakes made by committees from time to time.12.       &quot;Unemployed Committees, when organizing processions should not confine themselves to visits to the Board of Guardians, but should pay periodicalvisits/
- 1 -24visits to .To^--Oo-uncll me^rtings^ etc., &amp;c well.     Also processions and deputations. to thet local Press wherever such organs are misrepresenting or attacking the ..   unemployed,13,      &quot;In several Unemployed Committees there is a tendency to carry forward the baneful craft spirit by some delegates, who claim to represent a given trade or industry.     These elements must be &apos;taught by the communists the class needs of the unemployed, and wherever possible to develop; the whole unemployed movement alorg Class lines,14.      &quot;Every opportunity must be seized by the members of the Communist Party of proving to the Unemployed, that the root question is one of Class, Power and that without , ,     power thoy are nothing but Human Drifts     Ln thisconnection communists must use every instance of the use of a small number of police, to disperse or to attack thousands of unemployed workers, as valuable illustrations of the meaning of organised power,15*        &quot;The organisation of unemployed committees is very simple providing there Is a need for such committees. Chalking the flags with a suitable announcement, with the object of holding a demonstration out of which it is proposed to appoint a committee, is the most familiar and effective procedure.     Sometimes, a provisional committee is established, who then organise a meeting, and either co-opt members upon the provisional committee or proceed to elect&apos;a new one.&quot;As will be seen these plans correspond in many respects with the lines followed in the organisation of the unemployed.Communist speeches throughout the country show greatsimilarity and this fact is due to the issue of leaflets fromKing Street;   a batch of the latest leaflet entitled&quot;Capitalism or Communism - which will you fight for?&quot;: was sent to Leicester and handed to my correspondent for distribution; none readied their destination as they were sent&apos;to this office.     This leaflet, as the following extractsshow, is a good example of the methods used by communists to foster class antagonism: .&quot;DO YOU ENOW that,500 persons own       Over 34,000,000 peoplemore than one half      in England and Walesof the land in the      alone own no land at all?United Kingdom?They own 4 C.COO * 000out of the 77,000,000acres.70. of the population 88^ of the population owns owns 64$ of the   i        orlyUS^ of the aggregate aggregate wealth?        wealth?38,000/

Instructions, signed byMcM&amp;McManus andPoet have been issued to all branches that:(l)      &quot;Wherever possible candidates should.be put forward to run directly under the auspices of 1 the Communist Party...(2)        &quot;In cases where it Is both possible and advisable, branches should secure the adoption of members of the Communist Party as candidates to run under Labour Party auspices...(3)      &quot;Whore It is possible and advisable advantage should be taken also to rvn candidates under the auspices of local Unemployed Committees, or to support candidates run by such Committees...(4)      &quot;Where none of the above stated conditions prevails, and Where the contest is merely between Labour Party representatives, the policy of th  Party should be to generally support the Labour Party candidates, endeavouring in such cases tfet press home the needs of the situation as forcibly as possible, and thus force the hands 0$ tij Labour Party candidates.(&quot;The intense industrial situation will put on increasing strain on the local municipal\ machinery especially during the coming winter. Should a political ferment arise or circumstances likely to lead to the use of police or armed force against the struggling workers, it is well that the direction of -N authority should not be In the hands of some\ local Churchill.   On the other hand   a Labour-authority, especially if returned hy communistsupport/ &apos;
5tsupport is more likely to come under oommunist influence.    Better still, of course, would be oommunlst control of the municipality,, but in the absence of that, we should put the strain on the Labour Party. Where the Labour candidate is a rank reactionary - Judged from the Labour Party standard-branches should use discretion in the manner of identification with his candidature1)...(6)        &quot;In all oases where Party members are put forward as candidates, whether directly by the Communist Party branch, or under the auspices of an Unemployed Committee or local Labour Party, such members must first make a written declaration of adhesion to the Communist Party as required under Party Constitution and Rules,Owen Ford has been appointed Midlands organiserof the Party in succession to James Stewart, who hasbeen transferred to the Young Communist International.An Intercepted letter from Whitehead to HacManuaoontains interesting information about the position ofthe Communist Party in Germany, which has 400,000 member as against 1,000,DOO members in the Majority Socialists,Whitehead says that there is more evidence of th*Communista in London than in Berlin, though there are*mly 10,000 members in thw whole of Great Britain.   Hepoints out that the subscription of 6d. a week asagainst ifd.- in Germaiiy &apos;1b a fatal bar to -the expansionof the Gommunist Party in this country.USE COMMUNISTS AND THE RUSSIAN FAMINEThe Communists are doing their utmost to exploit the Russian   Famine.Cn October 13th Whiteheadreported from Berlin to the Communist  Party of GreatBritain that; ,        &apos;&quot;The full meeting of the International Committee continued its sitting last evening and completed its present arrangements.

On the following a ay Whitehsad informed McManusthat in reference to famine relief his: opinion was thatthe whole action should &quot;be widened by the formationof a Committee   under some such title as tho BritishWorkers BussianFamine Relief Committee, and that*Tom Mann should be made chief of the committee,*&quot;As his name and past position in the Trade Union world would give the whole thing a sound basis,   ill well-known representatives of Trade &apos; Unions &quot;who are friendly to ug. Purcell, Pollitt, Ramsay, Jaok Mills, and as many more as possible should also be invited.   In addition to these well-known Artists and Intellectuals should form a sub-committee to work parallel and in conjunction.    Adam of the Central Branch and our friends in the 1917 Club would doubtless assist. Separata premises from tho Party should be taken and separate notopapor printed.   The expenses necessary for this to be defrayed from the Russian famine Funds.   A sub-commit toe for publicityP would also be necessary,   !3o long as the party maintains a controlling interest and the Committee is attached to this centre, fresh dements from other parties and from Trade Unions etc., can bo introduced.   The aim of the Committee to be ^Immediate Corn for Soviet Russia Famine Areas free from all politics-.&quot;Whitehead insists that tho international committee should confine its attention fa? the timobeing to the provision of corn and leave the care ofchildren to the Hoover Commission and the Save theChildren Fund.   The Amsterdam section is providingmedicine.There is reason to believe that the position of &quot;British Commissioner&quot; for the Russian Famine Relief, to which reference was made at a meeting- addressed by CE. Chesterton on October 7th, was offered to Sir William Robertson and refused and has since been offered to Sir Ian Hamilton.THB BSD IHTBMATIOIAL OF LABOUR UM0K3On October 15th a conference of the Red International of Labour Unions was held in the memorial/
1J2 -Memorial Hall:   F. Thompson of tho Dockers1 Union,was In the chair and speeches were made by Tom Mann,Harry Pollitt, W. G^Hacher, Hannington and Pomhery.About 600 delegates claiming to represent over300 branches of trade unions were present.     Thefollowing are two of the resolutions passed:^Russian Famine^&quot;That this conference, knowing the extreme urgency of the need for practical help for the people of the famins stricken area in Russia expresses its disgust at the procrastinating behaviour of the Governmental Commission on Russian Relief and urges every worksr in employment to do his utmost to support the Famine Fund in the most practical way.&quot;^ynemploymont&quot;This conference pledges itsolf to support evs reasonablo measure to remedy unemployment and directs attention to the fc,ct that work or adequate maintenance at Trade Union rates is the only sensible proposals and pledge ourselves to&apos;usc our influence in tho Unions to secure this; and demand that militancy be shown by &quot;Union Executives and a stop put to the humiliating and degrading impositions of the. capitalists, who, in addition, to fore log- down wages are now impudently seeking to extend the working hours0   We refuse to further acquiosce in this outrageous tyranny and pledge ourselves to work increasingly in the Unions,, ani prepare for drastic action, to meet the requirements, not as dumb driven cattlos but as free men taking all the consequences^,&quot;lom Mann gave a long report on Russia as he had seen it.   Ee described the Famine Area and stated that at a parade of the Red Army he had said there were only a million revolutionaries in England, but that he was one with them in their desire to overthrow the capitalist system.    Mann dwelt at langth on the communist organisation in Russia whereby a membership of only 60,000 oontrollod the whole country:   he visited a metal-worker*s shop but found to^his surprise that there were only four communists in the building and was subsequently told by his guide that the communists were distributed/
m 13distributed in various districts in order to keep Moscow in touch with events.The resolution on unemployment was moved by Gallacher and seconded by Banning ton of the National Administrative Council of Unemployed:   a man who is believed to be Pembury of the Clapham Amalgamated Engineering Union, moved an amendment &quot;that this conference of delegates return to their branches, with instructions to move that an armed force be created in the unemployed organisations to retaliate the attacks of the police,&quot;     The chairman refusod to accept this amendment and Gallachor said that ho would not be held responsible for having it tacked on to his. resolution: it was wlthdrawna   The Russian Famine resolution. Was moved by N. Watkins and seconded by George 23eacon0A good deal of confusion has been caused by the attempted formation of the National   Maritime and Shipworkers3 Union of Great Britain and Ireland by a section of tho Liverpool Se&amp;iiienrs Vigilance Committee. Tom Mann is interested in the new union which would appear to be an outcome of tho Red International of Labour Unions1 propaganda, but the opinion of the more competent revolutionaries is that tho movement is being engineered by men who want paid jobs.   It has a certain amount of support in Liverpool but practically none as yet, in the South Wales ports0THE INPEPENDMCT LABOUR PARTYAn urgent appeal for funds has been issued by the Independent Labour Party in which it is stated^ that the Party is passing through &quot;its*severest testing time&quot; and that its income this year has suffered a loss of 1,200/
 1,200, owing to the stoppage of subsidies formerly received from tho National labour Press and the Independent Labour Party Boot Society.ARRESTS, AND CONVICTIONS(On October 8th Abraham   Greenborg? one of the   I Stepney Unemployed, a Russian who left this country tin j the Military Service Convention and landed again in 19 without the permission of the Immigration Officer, was bound over in the sum of  5 to keep the peace for twel-months.   On the same day Joseph Abrahams was also bouni over for the same period in the sum of 40/-; both were charged with insulting the police at Cable Street, St. L Georges, on October 7th,On October 15th Abraham Lasiensky,&quot; secretary, an; Alfred Dinimore, organiser, of the Stepney unemployed, were also charged \&quot;ith using insulting words and behaviour but were discharged by the magistrate who advised them to be mere careful in the future.As a result of the disorder in London on October 13th, Arthur Wager, Arthur Buck, and Samuel Smith, were charged on October 14th at Marlborough Street Police Court with obstructing the police and throwing missiles each was fined 20/- or sentenced in default to eleven days1 imprisonment;   the fines were not forthcoming,3INN FEIN IN GRBM?. BRITAINSinn leiners in Great Britain have been outwardly quiet but are working as actively as ever in the secret movement,For some time past it has been known that the higher officials of the Irish Self-Determination League have been acting as collecting agents for arms andammunition/
ammunition for the Irish Republican Army: Connolly, the South Wales organiser, a firebrand from the Tyneside district, who was specially sent to South Wales in this connection, was particularly suspect ad.     His correspondence was watched with the result that in conjunction with the local police, he and five of his chief agents were arrested during the week,,    .. An examination of his papers disclosed a wide conspiracy, spreading from South Wales to the Tyneside&quot; and engineered by the local organisers of tho Irish Solf-Petermination League through the secretaries of some of their&apos; branches:   raids :on military stores, territorial drill halls, mine magazines, etc, had been arranged and hare, in some cases,, actually been carx-ied out:Gxplosires and arms obtained, by this   means wei-e shipped by trawlers, or other local means, from Liverpool and Cardiff, motor cars also ware used for transport from place to place,     She ramifications of the conspiracy are extensive and it will take some time before the enquiry is complete, but, so far, besides the six arrests a considerable quantity of explosives, arms and ammunition has bden&apos; seised:   in the case of Liverpool 26 bottles filled with paraffin oil were found at one of the houses searched, which indicates that further incendiary fires were contemplated,On October 9th Art 0*Brien addressed a large and an enthusiastic mooting at Woolwich Town Hall and claimed a victory for tho Irish Republican Army in as much as their courage and devotion had brought about tho present peace negotiations j   he said that the Irish Republican Government was functioning despite all opposition and that they intended to keep what they had established;&quot;Therefore/
&quot;Therefore, there oan he only one peace and that is the peace whioh will recognise that situation and allow the Government of the Irish Republic to ge ahead without interfere^e,&apos;1IRBLAIifPThe situation in Ireland remains unchanged.   The Sinn Fein leaders, while talking peace, are steadily preparing for war.   Reports are received of firms like Brennan and Walsh of Dublin, whose connection with Sinn Fein is well-known, endeavouring to purchase bandoliers and other articles of equipment from English firms. In mining districts magazines have been broken into and quantities of explosives stolen by Sinn Fein agents. Arms are being stolen from Brill Halls, etoti and collected by agents in different parts of the country.One hopeful sign is that the Sinn Fein Courts are reported to be losing their popularity owing to their methods being too drastic.    The weekly collections for the Irish Republican Army are also said to be slumping;   people are getting tired of their exactions.Farmers and business people generally are said to bo losing their faith in Sinn Fein*s power to effeot a settlement and fear a return to the old bad days.   Some ef them are likely to break away if no agreement is reached ,
