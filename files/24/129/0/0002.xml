No.571. Dated 11th.

Your attention is invited to my telegrams ending with number 500 of October 5th regarding French attitude to Great Britain; to my telegrams ending with number ?558 of October 7th regarding my proposals fro Feisal&apos;s (? mission) to Mustapha Kemal and to General Baghdad&apos;s telegram of September 15th. X 2915 of October 9th., X2920 and X2921 of October 10th regarding position of Mustapha Kemal in Angora and telegram No.1193 of October 5th to Foreign Office from Satow, Beyrout.

2. Reviewing the position from this and salient points of situation to-day seem to be (1) Irritated no doubt by a misconception of our policy in Syria and Iraq, French have endeavoured to conclude an agreement with Mustapha Kemal so far without complete success. It is their hope to aggrandise their own influence and interests in Near East at the expense of those of the British. (2) It is still Mustapha&apos;s belief that Great Britain is mainstay of Greeks and in consequence he is extremely resentful. (3) Disappointed at recent success of Mustapha and Enver Pasha&apos;s consequent loss of prestige Bolshevik Russia is fearful lest Franco Turkish solidarity should defeat her ends in Turkey. She is therefore scheming (a) to widen differences between England and France. (The subtle exaggerations (?display)ed in Satow&apos;s telegram October 5th 1199 if not from Bolshevik sources at least favour Bolshevik interests)(b) to (? group omitted) Franco-Turkish negotiations thereby increasing prestige at Mustapha&apos;s expense.
3.   outcome of developments at Angora during next few days will have such vital consequences for Iraq that I venture to urge upon Eis Majesty1s Government my most strong conviction not only that now is the psychological moment for immediate aotion but fchat any delay may prore most prejudicial to our interests.4.   In order to counteract factors and forces working against us our desiderata ole&amp;ssly are (1) a policy of co-operation with french and (2) the opening of a door for negotiations with angora government, . $ay I be permitted to suggest as regards ? francothe secret-information in possession of His Majesty^ Government,may perhaps he oap.ah.lo of exploration and France induced to con-tinue her negotiations at Angora but on basis that will be aooept-able both to His Majesty1s Government and.to Mustapha.   Perhapsit could be suggested to French that main reason for AngoraGovernments disinclination to accept French proposals is thatthey are alarmed at exolusive privileges which French Government.     . beare   ndeavouring to s^oure and this being so: it would/in theirown interest as well as that of Surope inigenei^al to modify their ambitions.. Che ideal result would be that, ultimately negotiations should become tripartite.   I have already intimated that as re-gar Is latter best method I can suggest Is that Feisal should open negotiations and It Is for consideration, whether in view of extreme urgency of situation communication might not be attempted by wire-less.   I realise that any suoh communication would have so -to be worded that French might know of It and had position at Angora seemed less critical I would not have suggested it.   Bolshevik menace would probably cease to oause anxiety and Iraq ootild hope &quot;for that peaoe on her borders which is essential to her salvation were these two policies viz. roboneillation with France and [^acceleration of) negotiation With Mustapha to suoceed.COX.Whitehall Gardens.
