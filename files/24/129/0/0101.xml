[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]EASTERN. [April 19.]CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2.[E 4707/1/44] No. 1.Earl Gurzon to Lord Flardinge (Paris).(No. 1132.)My Lord, Foreign Office, April 19, 1911.THE French Ambassador having asked to see me this afternoon, in order to present to me the note which, in my absence, he had handed to the Prime Minister yesterday, i-egarding the question ol German reparations and the views of the French Government thereon, I took advantage of the occasion to make a few observations to him about the agreement which his Government had recently concluded, without reference to us, with the Angora Government while Bekir Sami Bey and the delegates of the latter were in London.I said that our first knowledge of this agreement, apart from the fact that, we knew that negotiations were proceeding for the cessation of hostilities and the return&apos; of prisoners, had come from a publication, in some French newspaper, of the text of the treaty concluded. We had thereupon expressed our great surprise to the French Government that they had come to this arrangement behind our backs and without any communication to us. Nor did the reply, which we had then received, that parliamentary reasons had prevented its disclosure to us before it was laid before the French Chamber, appear to me to be at all an adequate explanation.Subsequently, the French Government had handed to us the text, and I had now had an opportunity of carefully perusing this. It seemed to me to raise two points of some importance.In the first place, I found it difficult to reconcile the conclusion of any such agreement with one of our enemies in the recent war with the declaration which had been signed in London in November 1915 between Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Russia, in which each of the signatory parties engaged not to conclude peace separately during the war, and, further, that when terms of peace came to be discussed no one of the Allies would demand conditions of peace without the previous agreement of each of the other Allies. I thought it difficult to contend that this clause of the declaration had not been violated in letter as well as in spirit.Further, I noticed that certain of the provisions of the agreement, notably those with regard to the frontier line between the Turkish territory and the French mandated territory in northern Syria, were in apparent disagreement with, or at any rate were departures from, the tripartite agreement and the Treaty of. Sevres ; and this added to my surprise that the French Government had not thought it desirable to consult us upon a matter which equally affected all the Allies, and which could not become operative without their consent.The case was not rendered better by the fact that . Count Sforza had taken advantage of the conference in London to conclude an independent agreement on his own part with the same enemy. Indeed, the Italian agreement was in some respects in wider divergence from existing obligations than the French. In neither case did it seem to me possible to pass by the incident without indicating the anxiety which it had caused us.The French Ambassador&apos;s explanation was a mixture of candour and ingenuity. He said, in the first place, that everyone knew that the French military position in Cilicia was so precarious that they were bound to conclude peace with Mustapha Kemal in order to get out their troops and to avoid the enormous expenditure of a protracted campaign.   This was as well known to us as to everybody else.Further, as to our complaint of being kept in the dark, M. Briand claimed that he had informed Mr. Lloyd George at every stage, if not of the actual details, at least of the lines upon which he was proceeding, and he conceived that he was acting in strict co-operation with his allies in what he had done.I remarked that I had heard of no such revelations, and that I could not help thinking that there had been some exaggeration in the explanations of M. Briand. Several opportunities had occurred of acquainting the Foreign Office with what had passed, and certainly we had been kept entirely in the dark.His Excellency then explained that, had the matter been left to him to conduct by the traditional diplomatic methods, he would have been only too glad to have kept us[7338]
informed with what was passing and to show us the document before it&apos; was . signed. He could see no reason why this should not have been done, but we were living in. days now when the old conventions were not always strictly observed and when conversations took place, and arrangements were made between Prime Ministers which sometimes superseded the efforts of the old diplomacy. Had M. Briand been acting as Foreign Minister, he would undoubtedly have behaved in the way I had suggested. On the other hand, as Prime Minister, he evidently thought he had discharged his duty by whatever communications he had made to the British Prime Minister.I replied to this argument, which did not altogether convince me, by postulating a situation in which the British Government having done the same or a similar thing, and the Comte de Saint-Aulaire having come to me on instructions from his Government to make a protest, I had delivered the reply with which I had just been favoured by him.   Would he have been altogether satisfied with such an explanation ?His Excellency endeavoured to dismiss the subject as one of no great importance, arising from the peculiar circumstances of the hour.I said that I was not content to accept this plea and that I had discharged what 1 thought was a necessary duty in informing him of the point of view, from which we had no alternative but to regard it. ,I am, &amp;c.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.
