(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITAI5NIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHMEET)0 A B I N E TRET,,3498 REPORT BY THE G2NSHAL OFFICER COMMANDING-&quot; IN -CHIEF OK THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FORWEEK-ENDING 12th NOVEMBER, 1921.fCirculated by the Secretary of State, for War).1.    GBHSRAL MILITARY SITUATION.There is.no change in the General Military Situation. A cartain amount of dissatisfaction with rebel leaders is . slowly beginning to make itself felt amongst the rank: and file of the I.R.A. and the disloyal oivilian population.     In some cases this feeling is due to the delay in effooting a settle-ment, while in other cases it is the result of restivenass on the part of extremists who do not want a settlement.     The Rebel Leaders atfe experiencing more difficulty as times goes on, in retaining their grip- on the extremists.Law-abiding persoife, and, in&apos; fact, all who desire a settlement are faced with several difficulties.   Shopkeepers foresee great loss of trade if the Crown Forces are withdrawn, and farmers are doubtful of finding a good market for their produce under the new regime.   Sinn Fein Courts   press    - . -.  particularly hsEd% on loyal people, who, If they refuse to .&apos;&apos; defend a case in these Courts, find the bases go against them by default.     It yet remains%o be seen whether theinumber of these Courts will decrease as. a. result of the decisions of the London Conference on the subject. &apos;  Levies for I.R.A, are also. a source of grievance to the^population in general.   The boy-oott of English goods is only less rigorously enforced than that of Belfast goods...The decisions oome to by/the joint Committee on the observance of the Truce have dealt with these activities of the I.R.A., but there is, at present, little sign of effect being given to these decisions by.the rebels, although Sinn Fein Courts and the work of I.R..A. police are less advertised in the Press, ...Drilling and training Camps are, perhaps, rather less prevalent of late.     This is probably due to the arrival of Winter, and to the fact that the novelty of drilling without hindrance has worn off, and I.R.A. &quot;officers&quot; are finding it difficult to maintain keenness amongst their men in present conditions.Although it Is too soon to judge of the general effect of the Northern Parliaments reply to the Prime ^Minister on  . Southern Ireland, the manoeuvre by which Ulster&apos;s stubbornness is represented as the only stumbling block to peace, has increased the bitterness felt in the Country districts towards the North.CSgd)    C.
