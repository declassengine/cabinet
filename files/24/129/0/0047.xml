P DQPUMhiMT IS THE Hi0PERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S&apos;S ODVKRNMBMT.S 0 R g T .CABINET.C*P*, 3446*GERMAN RE reparations.Memorandum Jpfc the ; Minis toy of Health.In reference to my memorandum to the Cabinet on the 15th March, 1921 (CP.-2722), I would like once more to draw attention to the question of the method of payment of German reparations which I outlined in this memorandum.     I made various suggestions based on the fact which is now generally acknowledged that German reparations must in the main be paid from the produce of their export trade, that such trade consists mainly of manufactured and seni**&amp;nufactured goods, and that the pressure of the sale of such goods on the world&apos;s markets is causing a competition which is demoralising the course of prices and the trend of business throughout the wox\Ld.     further, it incidentally helps to produce the collapse in the German Exchange which on the one hand renders the competition of the products of that country more severe, and on the other hand reduces the purchases of that country to very small limits.     So strongly Is the pressure of this competition being felt thai it is obvious from the Debates in the House end from the Press that there Is a growing movement tov/ards demanding a cancellation of toe German obligation to us as being less harmful to our interests in the present state of things.In my opinion, and from all points of view tooth moral and financial, it is impossible to admit such a contention.     The real question is now, as I have previously pointed out, not to let the Germans off from their just obligations to us, but to obtain reparation in a form advantageous to this country and the Empire. In my previous   ^memorandum I have indicated the lines on which this could be done.I am fully aware of the political difficulties which may be involved in putting such a scheme forward;   I would, however,like/
like to point out that everybody would realise there is only one of two courses which we can follow, that is to say, either to abandon, our chare of reparation altogether, or to endeavour to direct the flood of German goods into channels in which we wish them to go by agreement on the lines I have indicated, rather than to continue as at present to let the Germans spread this flood entirely unregulated in any way they like to the continual disturbance of British trade with the concomitant result of large unemployment in this country.The purchasing power of this country and the Empire is obviously limited.     The fact, that we have had to restrict the capital amount which we are prepared to guarantee on loan in the Trade Facilities Bill to the quite relatively insignificant figure of  25,000,000 on the plea.that the money market would not be able to provide a larger amount is in itself a sufficient proof that we cannot undertake except to a very limited extent the useful capital work which could be done in this country and in the dominions and the Grown Colonies if our money resources were sufficiently large.If this be so, it would be evidently to our advantage to obtain from Germany for nothing a considerable amount of semi-manufactured and manufactured goods which we ourselves cannot purchase because we cannot find the necessary means.     This would indirectly enable ug to employ a very large amount of our unemployed labour in works ancillary to and necessary for the utilisation of such goods imported from Germany.     It is especially in electrification schemes that this could be applied, but there are many other directions in which the scheme could be utilised and which, if the general idea were adopted, ?.ould have to be investigated by a email committee set up for the purpose.I have been much strengthened in the soundness of my conclusion by the fact that I find it is supported by such an eminent financial authority as Sir Henry Strakosch, who haskindly/
kindly cent me a copy of a memorandum he has written- on the subject, in which he arrives quite independently of me at very similar conclusions to mine.     I attach a copy of his memorandum, together with an extract from a leading article in &quot;The Times&quot; on the 18th October, from which it would appear that we receive the support of that paper.The fact that the French Government succeeded in overcoming the prejudice of their people in making an arrange-ment of this nature with th3 German Government also has an important bearing on the subject.It is obvious that, in the state of public opinion and in view of the possible default by Germany if the present agrees ment is adhered to, the matter cannot be left where it is, and I would strongly urge that the subject shall be considered  . again at the earliest possible date.Ministry of HealthA.    MOND. 27.10.21
Leading Artiole on the Collapse of toe Market. Extract from &quot;Times&quot;, 18th October.To us the form of the reparation is more important than the amount.     It is a distinct gain to receive goods from Germany for nothing.     The value of these goods is applied theoretically to the relief of taxation; in practice, it lessens the amount which would otherwise have to be borrowed.     But, as we have pointed out before, there is a world of difference between reparation paid in the form of goods which are competitive with our own, arid goods which are complementary or supplementary.     This aspect of the matter is, we are glad to note, now receiving the attention which it deserves.
copy 17,10.21.MEMORANDUM ON THE QUESTION OP REPARATIONSBYSIR HENRY STRAKOSCH.It is almost- superfluous to empbaslso- the far-reaching consequences which the question of Reparations is bound to have upon the economic life, not only of this country and the Dominions, but of the whole world.     The ae- consequenee3 may well produoo most powerful political re--actions *     It Is equally unnecessary to dwell upon the faot that, in view of the magnitude of tho sum which Germany is oalled upon to pay, she trill only be able to meet her obligations out of her future surplus production, and not out of any form of wealth already existing.Let me briefly summarise the effect of this upon the economic life especially of this country.     In order to create claims to payment in foreign currencies to meet her obligations, Germany will have to sell good?, or render services, abroad * The goods she will have to sell abroad will be mainly of a manufactured or semi-manufactured character, for It &quot;would obviously be impossible for her to realise sufficient by the.sale of raw materials she is able to produce.     The sale of these goods -whether raw materials or semi-manufactured or manufactured goods, and whether sold in this country, the Dominions or any other country - will almost without exception take place in competition with the goods produced in this country or the Dominions.     To save herself from the consequences which would follow from her failure to meet her obligations&apos;, Gemany will strain every nerve to find buyers for her goods abroad, and her competition with our own goods will therefore be of the severest kind.    The same is true of the services she oan render abroad.     To meet this competition, It would be necessary for th* level of wages, and therefore the standard of living, in this country to be lowered to the level ruling in Germany, which today is of course far below ours.     But can it be supposed that the world, in itsimpoverished/
Impoverished state, will be capable of absorbing the flood of goods which it would be necessary to sell abroad for our industries to be kept going and for Germany to meet her Reparations Bill and her necessary imports?    For be it rememberod that there are in Europe some 250,000,000 to 300,000,000 people today whose purchasing power represents only a email fraction of what it was in pre-war days.    If we fail to beat the Gomaans in this unequal competition, we shall have to face unemployment of vast dimensions.     If Germany falls to sell sufficient of her products abroad, and in consequence falls to meet her obligations to the Allies, this may well lead fro coercive measures being applied to her. The postponement of a real Peace whioh this would involve would re-act most powerfully upon the  restoration of economic conditions throughout the world. What is the remedy?The problem, it seems to me, is to discover a way of preventing the goods produced by Germany In respect of reparations from reaching the markets of the world in corn-petition with our own goods.    These German reparation goodir must be stored away, but so stored away as to be economically useful.    That, in my view, oan only be done by devoting them (and Germany under the Peace Treaty and the Reparations Agreement is compelled to deliver such goods as any of the Allies requires for the &quot;development of its industrial or economic life&quot;) not to the ordinary every day requirements of the world, but to extraordinary purposes such as the erection of plant and equipment - in other words, for purposes of a capital character.     If, for instance, Germany were to be made to produce goods which would be used for the perfection and extension of our industrial and commercial equipnent&apos;,ao/
so as to provide for the whole community services which would cheapen all forms of production, they would be usefully employed.Experts of the first order and undoubted integrity would have to examine the proposal and work out a comprehensive scheme by which this object could best be achieved.     The principle which should guide them would have to be that the extension and perfection of tho nation a equipment must be of a kind which will, as far as possible benefit the whole community, and whioh has for its fundamental object the facilitating and cheapening of all forms of production.     The scheme must not be employed for the purpose of improving the&apos; power of competition of one producer in this country as against another.     It must be available and of benefit as far as possible to all.Merely by way of example, the equipment which in this connection might come into consideration in the first instance would be for the cheapening ef power and for the improvement and cheapening of the means of transportation;   for Instance the erection of a number of great central electric-power stations in the Immediate neighbourhood of some of our large coalfields, the electrification of our busiest railways, the improvement of the equipment of harbours, etc,Germany should be called upon to deliver not only the goods necessary to carry through such schemes, but also the plant required to enable us to produce in this country and/or the Dominions the machinery etc, she has delivered to us, it being essential that we make ourselves independent in the matter of the manufacture of replacements of the German machinery etc. and for the manufacture of the machinery for possible extensions.The consummation of these schemes would obviouslyinvolve/
Involve expenditure in respect of labour and subsidiary materials In this country, and I should consider it economically thoroughly sound if that part of the public revenue which otherwise would be devoted to debt redemption were employed for this purpose. By doing this we should, Instead of redeeming debt, be placing behind it true economic value, from ?which we in the coming years and posterity would reap the full benefit.    The cheapening of production, the greater productivity and the greater power of competition assures to the Exchequer revenues for the future which will enable us to more rapidly reduce the National Debt.   In contracting the loans necessary to meet our vast war expenditure, we have pledged our future production.    We shall obviously be in a better position to redeem that pledge if we equip ourselves to produce more and to produce cheaply. Moreover, by eliminating the competition of German reparation goods, we not only materially reduce the probability of unemploy-ment, but we create employment in connection With the capital works referred to.     whatever progress Germany may make in the way of cheapening her iuthods of production during the years in which she will have tk devote a large part of her energies to the production of goods for reparations, ?e should, by our improved equipment, be able to better compete with her when she has discharged her obligations.The plan which I have outlined should not merely be confined to this country,     It should also cover the Dominions and Colonies, the object being to develop and to cheapen production all over   the British Empire, and to make the latter, as far as possible, self-supporting.In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that I am strongly of opinion tnat the various scheines which under this plan may be decided upon should be   carried out and run by private enterprise, and not by public administrations.    TheGovernment/
Government might accept from such private enterprises bonds yielding a moderate rate of interest in exchange for reparation goods delivered to them, and for that part of the public revenue invested in them, and It might in addition stipulate that a certain percentage of their profits be paid to the Government.     It should further exercise a reasonable amount of control over the charges to be made by these enterprises to the community for the services rendered, the object, of course, being to afford to the community at large the means of cheapening and facilitating production.
