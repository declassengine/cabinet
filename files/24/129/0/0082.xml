[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1921..cabinet.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretaey foe Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 7th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of Truce.To describe the observance of the truce by Sinn Fein during the past week as unsatisfactory would be to understate the very real gravity of the situation. The number of serious breaches was greater than in any other week since the commence-ment of the truce, and in at least two instances amounted to open and undisguised acts of war, which can be explained on no other theory than that the perpetrators intended the consequences of their action to be a general breakdown of the truce. That the leaders or Sinn Fein are genuinely anxious to fulfil the obligations they have entered into I have no doubt, but it is becoming increasingly evident that their control over the extremist section of their followers throughout the country leaves much to be desired, and although the numerical strength of this section is probably small, its capacity for mischief under present circximstances is out of all proportion to its numbers. Unless the authority of the more responsible members of the organisation can be reasserted, and proper discipline be restored, it will be necessary to have recourse to other methods than those provided by the liaison arrangements for dealing with breaches of the truce which are, at the same time, serious infractions of the law. This necessity has, in fact, already arisen in regard to Sinn Fein Courts, and I have given instructions in more than one case that the Crown Forces are to use force, if other methods prove unsuccessful, in preventing the holding of any such Court which attempts to exercise criminal jurisdiction or to deal with civil disputes in a manner which involves interference with the legal rights or personal liberty of any individual. In one case, at Mountmellick, Maryborough District, Queen&apos;s Co., on the 7th instant, the Police and Military were compelled to force an entrance into the Court in order to suppress the proceedings, but,met with no attempt at physical resistance from the persons present.The most serious breach of the truce was a raid upon the Royal Irish Constabulary Barrack at Kesh, co. Fermanagh, on the evening of the 4th instant. Two of the raiders effected an entrance into the barrack by deceiving the guard into believing that they were members of the &quot;B Constabulary of the adjoining district of Pettigoe, and their accomplices thereupon rushed in and held up the four members of the Police who were present in the building, the remainder of the garrison being absent at a Police boxing contest which was being held at Enniskillen in aid of the County Hospital. The Police, &quot;four in number, were placed in the &quot; lock-up &quot; Avhile the raiders proceeded to ransack the barrack^ and to carry away in two motor cars a quantity of Police arms and equipment, including 18 rifles, 15 revolvers and 2,202 rounds of ammunition, together with 4(W. 10s. belonging to one of the Constables, and several other articles of Police personal property. From enquiries which have been made, there are grounds for believing that this outrage was committed by persons from outside the county of Fermanagh, which&apos; has for some time been one of the quietest parts of Ireland, and the Sinn Fein population of the locality have been loud in their expression of indignation. The matter was at once taken up with the Chief Sinn Fein Liaison Officer at Dublin, who at once instituted enquiries and promised that if members of his organisation were found to have been implicated every article of public and private property seized would be restored and full reparation would be made for any damage committed. Another outrage committed on the same day was a raid upon a military store in Tipperary.,[7296]SECRET.C.P.-3481.
resulting in the seizure of a large quantity of military equipment, including 2 Lewis guns, 34 Service rifles and a box of bombs. A similar undertaking in regard to reparation has been given by Sinn Fein in this case.The most important of the other breaches of the truce during the week were the shooting and wounding of a Constable, at Baltinglass, co. Wicklow, on the 30th ultimo, an assault upon a Constable at Shillelagh, co. Wicklow, and the firing at a Police patrol in Broad Street, Limerick, at 10 15 p.m. on the 7th instant. The full facts of the last-mentioned incident, in which one Constable was slightly wounded, are not yet to hand, but on the meagre information available it would appear to be the most serious breach of the truce yet committed.Thirty-two cases of illegal arrests were reported during the week. In six of these cases the motive of the arrest was to prevent the person arrested from attending at Petty Sessions, and in one case at least the motive was to bring before a Sinn Fein Court for trial a person who had taken proceedings in one of the ordinary Courts. Sixteen of the persons arrested are known to have been released. A case of illegal arrest, which on the facts alleged presents a very sinister appearance, was discovered! by the Police in Belfast on the 6th instant. The victim was found in a house in Kent Street under an armed guard consisting of three men, who announced to the Police, that they were &quot;Soldiers of the Irish Republican Army on duty.&quot; The three armed men in whose custody he was found were arrested by the Police.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.The results of six Court-Martial trials of civilians were promulgated during the week. In three of the&apos;cases the accused, who were members of the &quot;B &apos;&apos; Special Constabulary, were charged with the murder of three civilians in Mullinagough, co. Tyrone, on the 6th April last. AH three were acquitted: The other three trials were for the possession of arms and ammunition, and resulted in each case in the accused being bound over . in his own recognisances to keep the peace for twelve months.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 5th instant: Total orders made    ... ... ... ... ...      4,370Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       242 Releases ordered ... ... ... ...       645--        887Number of persons now interned..... ... 3,483The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 1....

It is now widely believed that Sinn Fein has.agreed to abandon its Republican claims provided that a solution of the Ulster question can be found which would be more agreeable to the feelings of Southern Ireland than that contained in the Home Rule Act of last year, and the hope is freely expressed that the Peace Conference will succeed in finding some scheme for re-uniting the Six Counties to the rest of Ireland which will be accepted by Ulster as satisfying her claims to separate treatment. .  ,H.
