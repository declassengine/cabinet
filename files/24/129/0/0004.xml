alp /^-W^vA[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] &quot;- . Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.SECRET.CP.-3404.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 10th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of the Truce.The general state of the country remains unchanged since my last Report. Complaints of breaches of the truce by Sinn Fein continue to be received from the Police, the most frequent subjects of complaint being drilling by the I.R.A., and Sinn Fein Court activities. A more serious matter is the reappearance in the Police reports of acts of violence committed upon individual members of the Crown forces. Two such incidents occurred during the week, but there is no suggestion in either case that the aggressors, if, as suspected, members of the I.R.A-, were acting under authority. The first incident occurred in Dunmanway, co. Cork on the 5th instant. A member of the Auxiliary Division was assaulted about 9-30 p.m. by a civilian who got put of a motor car, and when shortly afterwards a party of Auxiliaries recognised the car and attempted to hold it up they were fired upon by the occupants who numbered four or five. The Auxiliaries returned the fire, and, it is believed, mortally wounded one of their assailants. None of the Auxiliaries were wounded. The circumstances in which the original assault was committed are still under investigation. The second incident was the serious wounding of a member of the &quot; B &quot; Special Constabulary who was held up and fired at by three men at Maghera, Magherafelt District, co. Londonderry about 11 p.m. on the 8th instant. The wounded Constable was deprived of his rifle and bayonet. About 2 a.m. on the 8th instant a bomb was thrown at the Auxiliary Barrack, Tralee, shattering twelve panes of glass, but doing no other injury. Several countercharges of assault by members of the police forces upon civilians have been brought forward by the Sinn Fein Liaison Officers and are at present under enquiry. A very serious breach of the truce was committed at Skibbereen, co. Cork, on the 5th instant by the kidnapping of Mr. J. Travers Wolfe, Crown Solicitor for the City and West Riding of Cork, but on strong representations being made to the Chief Liaison Officer in Dublin, Mr. Wolfe was released uninjured on the 8th instant.Indiscipline among Sinn Fein prisoners.On the 5th instant the Governors of His Majesty&apos;s Prisons in Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford were presented with demands by the convicted Sinn Fein prisoners in their custody for recognition of their status as prisoners of war, the demand being accompanied in each case by a threat of action to be taken for its enforcement if it&apos;was not complied with within four days. From the fact that the demands were framed in closely similar terms and were put forward on the same day, it is obvious that they were engineered from outside the prisons, and I find it difficult to imagine a more flagrant example of a violation of the truce provisions than this instance affords.- The threat of action to be taken within four days was duly put into execution in Waterford Prison about 8-40 a.m. on the 9th instant when the prisoners broke out into open mutiny immediately after Mass and proceeded to break the furniture and windows of their cells. On the Governor assuring them that their demand had been forwarded to the Irish Government and would no doubtf7106]
be discussed as a question of general principle with the Sinn Fein leaders, they undertook to desist from further attempt at violence. Representations to the same effect by the Governors of the other Prisons concerned were successful in preventing similar outbreaks.: .  ; .Situation in Belfast and Londonderry.The state of party feeling in Belfast continues to give cause for anxiety, but owing to the precautions taken by the Military and Police Authorities a recrudescence of rioting on a serious scale has happily been averted. Several isolated acts of aggression and violence by individuals and mobs of both parties were reported during the week, and one man (a Roman Catholic ,publican) was wounded in the head by a revolver bullet. A farmer named John Buchanan was found shot dead on the roadside at Gleddermott two miles from Deny at 7-30 p.m. on the 8th instant. Buchanan who was a Unionist had apparently been returning from the City where he had been selling butter. There was no sign of robbery and there is nothing to indicate the motive of this crime.&apos; &apos; .     - ;-Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.Three trials of civilians by Court Martial were concluded during the week the result in each case being a conviction. Sentence of five years&apos; penal servitude was imposed in one case for the possession of arms and ammunition (a Belfast case), and in the second case, the accused, an internee was sentenced to nine months&apos; imprison-ment without hard labour for the offence of digging a trench and attempting to escape from the Curragh Internment Camp. The third case was that of a Clerk in the R.I.C. Barracks, Dundalk, who, was fined  15, or in default four months&apos; imprisonment&apos; without hard labour, for purchasing an automatic pistol from a soldier.Internment Orders.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the . 8th instant: Total orders made ... ... ... ...      4,368Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       239 Releases ordered ... ... ... ...       474--        713Number of persons now interned   ... ... ...      3,655The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 29.State of the Police Forces.

Mr. de Valera&apos;s message on the eve of the-Conference breathes the same air of suspicion and rancour which characterised his public utterances at the early meetings of Dail Eireann and his declaration that his followers are struggling &quot; for the maintenance of a right that in its nature is indefeasible, and cannot there-fore be either relinquished or compromised,&apos;&apos;&apos; has evoked a note of alarm not only in the &quot;Irish Times&quot; (the Southern Unionist organ), but also in the &quot; Freeman &apos;s Journal,&quot; which, although not professedly a Sinn Fein paper, has given the Sinn Fein leaders its wholehearted support throughout the negotiations.H.G.Irish Office, S.W. 1, October 13, 1921.
