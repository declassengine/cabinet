t (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS GOVERNMENT). CONFIDI. confidential . cabinet ,*,?*, 542g!* LEAGUE OF NATIONSRESOLUTION OF THE ASSEMBLY CONCERNING REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS.REPORT BY M. LEON BOURGEOIS ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL   ONOCTOBER 12th, 1921.At its twenty-seventh meeting, held on the 1st October, 1921, the Assembly adopted eleven Resolutions contemplating certain measures to be taken by the Council with regard to the question of the Reduction of Armaments.    These Resolutions were introduced by a Report made to the Assembly by Committee No. 3, copy of which is attached to the present document.in view of the fact that the Council is still in session and that it may be some time before it meets again, the Council will no doubt think it advisable to consider what action it should take in respect of certain of these Resolutions.RESOLUTION 1.&quot;That it is desirable that the Temporary Mixed Commission should be asked to continue the work which it has begun&quot;.The Report on this subject which I had the honour tosubmit to the Council, and which the Council adopted at its meeting of September 12th, foreshadowed the necessity for theTemporary Commission of continuing the work which it had established the programme.    The Council might therefore simplyask the Commission to oontinue its work, notifying its   Presidentaccordingly.RESOLUTION 2.&quot;That the Temporary Mixed Commission be asked to make proposals on general lines for the reduction of national armaments which, in order to secure precision, should be in the form of a draft treaty or other equally definite plan, to be presented to the Council if possible before the Assembly next year.
&quot;In order to enable the Temporary Mixed Commission to accomplish this task, the Council should be asked to strengthen the Temporary Mixed Commission.&quot;The importance of this Resolution Is obvious.     TheCouncil will no doubt think it right to accept the resolution of the Assembly and communicate this acceptance to the Presidentof the Temporary Commission.The Temporary Commission as nominated by the Councilin a form intended to enable it to deal with all aspects ofthe question, and in particular a number of persons of highpolitical competence were nominated who should be able to seethe problems from the point of view brought out in this resolution, namely that of a general international arrangement.It may, however, be observed that the proposal contained in thesecond paragraph of this Resolution was supported in the AssemblyCommittee by some of the most prominent Members of the TemporaryCommission and it seems to me that the Commission itself is best able to judge what, if any, additions to its membershipit requires, in order to carry out this recommendation.The Commission might therefore be Invited, by the Council tomeet as soon as possible in order to lay before the council the names of such new Members as It may judge desirable to co-opt.It seems advisable however that the new members shouldnot be more than six in number.RESOLUTION r 3,&quot;A. statistical Investigation will be made with regard to the armaments of the various countries upon the lines indicated in the body of the Report&quot;*The Temporary Mixed Commission, as may be seen from itsReport, has already considered the lines upon which the statistical enquiry should be carried out.     It is suggestedthat the Council should simply draw the attention of theTemporary Commission to the above Resolution.
RESOLUTION 4.&quot;That the Temporary Mixed Commission be requested to continue the examination of the question of -the Private Manufacture $f Armaments and the Trade In Arms&apos;&quot;.The question of the private manufacture of armaments iaone to which the Covenant draws special attention.     TheTemporary Commission has already, as is seen In its Report,devoted to It much time and attention which have brought intorelief the difficulties of the problem.    The Council might therefore simply ask the Temporary Commission to continuethe examination of the question of the private manufacture of armament and the trade in arms *RESOLUTION 5.&quot;That the Council be requested to Invite all the Members of the League and interested States which are not Members of the League to take part in an International Conference on the Private Manufacture of Arms and the Trade in Arms, which should meet as soon as possible at a date-to be fixed under the responsibility of the Council.   It is considered highly desirable that this date should be prior tt the next session of the Assembly.The Temporary Mixed Commission should be entrusted with the task of preparing the programme of the Conference and of submitting to it a draft Convention.&quot;It is suggested that action on this Resolution be postponed for a future session of the Council, for it would be better notto fix the date of the Conference until the Temporary commission has been able, in accordance with Resolution 4, to make a more complete study of the question and until we know the resultof the Washington Conference.RESOLUTION 6.&quot;That the urgent importance of ratifying the Convention at the earliest possible moment should be strongly impressed on all the States signatories to the Arms Traffic Convention of St.Germain, whether Members of the League of Nations or not, and at the same time all non-signatory States, should be Invited to adhere to the Convention.
&quot;The   Assembly expresses Its earnest desire that the importance of this subject may be strongly urged at the forthcoming Conference on Disarmament at Washington.&quot;As regards the first part of this Resolution, the Council would perhaps Instruct the Secretary-General to bring it to the attention of all States which have not yet informed the League of their intentions on the subject.The second part of the Resolution could, perhaps, be best put into execution by the issue of an individual invitation to those Members of the League who will participate in the Conference on Disarmament to use their best endeavours during that Conference to secure full consideration for the important question of the ratification of this Convention by the Signatory States and adhesion thereto by the non-Signatory States which have not yet taken this step.If the Council concur in this view, the following draft letter is submitted for consider at ion Sir,The Report,on the Reduction of Armamentspresented by the 3rd Committee to the 2nd Assemblyof the League of Nations , and adopted by it on the1st October, includes among others, the followingResolution concerning the Arms Traffic Convention, signed at St. Germain:-&quot;That the urgent Importance of ratifying the Convention at the earliest possible moment should be strongly impressed on all the States signatories to the Arms Traffic Convention of St. Germain, whether Members of the League of Nations or not, and at the same time all non-Signatory States should be Invited to adhere to the Convention.&quot;The Assembly expresses its earnest desire that the importance of this subject may be strongly urged at the forthcoming Conference on Disarmament at Washington&quot;.
In compliance with this Recommendation theCouncil of the League at their meeting of...........October, instructed me to request the...............Government to use Its best endeavours to secure full consideration by the Conference on Disarmament at Washington for the important question of the ratification of this Convention by the Signatory States and of adhesion thereto by the non-signatory States which have not yet taken this step.For convenience of reference I am enclosing herewith a copy of the Report of the Temporary Mixed Commission dealing with the present status of the Arms Traffic Convention (see pages 13 to 16), and a copy of the Report on the Reduction of Armaments adopted by the Assembly on the 1st October.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Secretary General.
RESOLUTIOW 7.&quot;The Assembly, taking note of the view expressed in the Report of the Temporary Mixed Commission on the Reduction of Armaments with regard to the desirability of making pro-vision for excluding the import of arms and ammunition in time of peace from countries In which the traffic Is uncon-trolled, invited the Cornell to prepare a draft protocol for this purpose for the consideration of the various Governments.     At the same time It expresses the earnest hope that this procedure will not in any way be permitted to delay the general ratification of the Convention of St. Germain.     The steps that may eventually have to be taken for the destruction of the surplus stocks of munitions may be considered by the Temporary Mixed Commission&quot;.The same remarks apply to this Resolution as to 5 above.The consideration of this matter might therefore be adjournedto a later session of the Council.RESOLUTION 8.&quot;That, subject to the conditions set out in the recommen-datlon of the first Assembly, the recommendation that Members of the League should undertake not to exceed for the next two financial years following the present year the sum total of expenditure on military, naval and air forces, provided for in the budget of that year, should be again forwarded to all Members of the League, together with a statement showing the replies already received to this recommendation&quot;.The Council at its meeting of last February decided to communicate the recommendation of the first Assembly to the Members of the League and ask them to state what action they found It possible to take in regard to the carrying out of  . the recommendation.Replies to this communication have been received at intervals throughout the period between the Council meeting in February and the meeting of the Assembly,     The Council may perhaps feel that it is premature to repeat its former action at so short an interval.     Furthermore, the majority of States will be in a better position to announce their policy in this matter early in the year 1922 than they are at present.I therefore propose that this Resolution should be considered at the next session of the Counoil.
RB30LUTI0H 9.&quot;That the Temporary Mixed Commission be asked to examine -in consultation with the Permanent Advisory Commission -whether it is advisable to address an appeal to the scientific men of the world to publish their discoveries in poison gas and similar subjects, so as to minimise the likelihood of their being used in any future war&quot;.It will suffice simply to forward this Resolution to theTemporary Mixed Commission and the Permanent Advisory Commission.RESOLUTION 10*&quot;That it la desirable that propaganda in favour of the reduction of armaments, as contemplated in the Covenant, should be carried out with earnestness and conviction among all nations.&quot;RESOLUTION 11.&quot;In pursuance of the third resolution of the First Assembly, the Assembly is of opinion that the Secretariat should be asked to complete the organisation of the Section of the Secretariat dealing with the question of the reduction of armaments, and that this Section should have a directorship of its own, or other equivalent official organisation, quite separate from and, if necessary, in additional^a to, those already proposed by the Fourth Committee&apos; of the Assembly&quot;.These two Resolutions, if tho Council agrees, may beconsidered at a future session of the Council.    As regards Resolution11, the Secretary-General will no doubt submit in due course aproposal for our approval.Should the Council adopt these suggestions it might postponefor the present the consideration of the Assembly1s Resolutions 5,7,8, 10and 11, and make forthwith the following decisions:(1)     The Council instructs the Secretary-General to inform M. Viviani, the President *f the Temporary Mixed Commission, that the latter is asked to continue the work which It has begun.(2)     The Temporary Mixed Commission is invited to meet as early as possible and to lay before the Council the names of new members up to the number of six, which it desires to co-opt.     The Commission is Invited to make proposals on general lines for the reducljJLon of national armaments which, in order to secure precision, 3hould be in the form of a draft treaty or other equally definite plan, to be presented to the Council If possible before the Assembly next year.
