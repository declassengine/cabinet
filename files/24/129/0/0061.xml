n/6tu fr1^&apos;^     -    450(THIS DQCTOEEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAI&amp;TlO^may?STY&apos;3 GOVERKESET. )SECRET4CABINET.CP.3460----- THE MILITARY SITUATION Iff IBM.Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.. (Received Colonial Office 11,30 pun. 28th October, 1921).Clear the LineeNo. 622 dated 28th October.In continuation of my telegram of 25th October tfo. 616 I think a frank answer must now be given to Eeisals first en-quiry which is one that I have been expecting fcr some time.So far as we can appreciate it locally the presentposition seems to be as follows:-Pirstly.   As regards period during which War Office retain military responsibility.   It is emphasized by General Officer Commanding in Chief that the present military programme and policy are based cn hypothesis of a friendly Turkey and that in present circumstances in whioh military garrison has been reduced to very low limits there can be no operations of military force.    To assist civil power the only available means of offence now is that of aeroplanes and gunboats for which levies and Arab army must provide the ground support.As regards defence;    in tho event of serious aggros-sion General Officer Commanding considers that he could not do more than maintain communications from Baghdad to Basrah byTigus and hold Bsghdad long enough to ensure successful evacuation. Secondly.     IShen Air XcQ$e assume military responsibility position would nc.-; neoessarily be the same.     \7hatprecisely Air Ministry&apos;3 attitude would be I cannot of course say but it would seem that provided they have the support of Arab army and levies on land the whole of such strength as will be available under Air Scheme couldbe
&quot;be concentrated for action in any direction either offensive or defensive.     It follows if that view is correct that our position will bo considerably stronger whan Air Ministry taiies over oontrol than it can be during interval for whioh oontrol remains under War Office but that as local forces beoome effeotive so will it become progressively stronger.     Whether or not Air Ministry when they assume oontrol will be prepared to accept res-ponsibility referred to by Peisal is a point on which you will doubtless assure yourself, and this having been done I thi ,k that ?feisal should be informed what outlook is as regards   possible Turkish aggression and exactly how we stand both at present moment and progressively in future as regards our preparedness to accept responsibility for defence.     How greatly my hands would be/strengthened if we could be assured that hypothesis of a friendly Turkey on which all our calculations have been based was likely to be realised before the Spring I need Scarcely emphasise.On condition of a friendly Turkey answer to query (2) might be in affirmative.Reply to (3) would appear to be that it is not the intention of His Majesty1s Government to compel any Kurdish area to separate from Iraq but they consider that when final decision has been arrived at In regard to Kurdistan policy opportunity ity should be accorded to all Kurdish areas to consider thoir position afresh by light of it.I surest reply to query (4) mi^ht be that in the event of separation of any area His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose to establish in area affected a system of local autonomy under British supervision having for its object discouragement of Turkish
propaganda and eventual federation of Kurdistan with Arab districts into a united Iraq.      Peisal remarked whan asking for replies on these points that in any caso in the oourse of treaty negotiations question of ultimate responsibility for defence would need clearing up.     Treaty negotiations I anticipate will start in two or four d&apos;&amp;ya time and though other less important point can bo the subject of our opening deliberations I request that I ainy bo acquainted with decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government without delay.COS.
