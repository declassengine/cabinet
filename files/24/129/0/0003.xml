The Revival of Trade.l.t   immediate Relief of -3)istress.(a) Assistance to Guardians in Necessitous Areas. ...&quot; ....As the result of discussions between the Treasury, the Minis-try .of Health/and the Scottish Office $ it has been found impc^-sihle-to devise a formula -for^assis-tance to Gruax^ans^JLn^jieo-e^sitous areas by way of grants that will..not undermine the whole system of Poor Law finanoe.   It hass therefore, been:agreed that assistance in special oases where it is&quot;shown that the Guardians (in England) and the Parish Councils (in Scotland) cannot themselves.provide oir borrow money to meet their obligations should.-take the form of a loan.   The maximum period being five years, with a discretion to the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Board of Health to sanction loans for as much as ten years in exceptional circumstances.   It is estimated that as much as  3,000,000 should be set aside for this purpose.Applications should be dealt with by the Minister of Health with the assistance of a small Advisory Committee upon which the Secretary for Scotland should be represented.(b) Compulsory Distress Levy Sohemg.The Committee have considered the Report to the Cabinet of the Relief of Distress Committee (CP.3391, (copy attached) which may he briefly summarised as follows.For...;.- .A - -       i -\

Tho Committee understand that any substantial increase in the present number of unemployed would upset the actuarial basis, of the scheme and render necessary an increase of .the rates of contribution.The contributions will &quot;be collected by means of cards and stamps on the analogy of Health and Unemployment Insurance, and the Ministry of Labour, will &quot;be generally responsible for the ad-mini strati on of the. scheme.   At.the samo time the cards and stamps will be. kept quite, distinct and . separate&apos; from those&apos; used &quot; for Unemployment Insurance purposes.   . &apos;&quot;-Evory.effort is to be mado to secure-that employers assist in making the wchemo a success-by exhorting them to give aid in such matters as the obtaining and filling up of the cards, etc.In order that.the scheme.may be put in operation within&quot; &apos;S&amp;QUldfour weeks time, immediate sanction      . be given to print the necessary cards and stamps.in advance of any legislation&apos;which &quot;-may be necessary.- ,&apos;It Is not proposed, tc require any special destitution test, and while the Relief of Distress Committee have,&apos;after consult-&apos; ation, rejected the suggestion that, the. benefits should be - given in kind, the Unemployment- Committee have referred this particular matter to. a Sub-Committee..for; further /-examination. &quot; The &quot;Uneinploy*-ment Commitee recommend;the\Cabinet:V-       &apos;&apos;-&apos;*&apos; - -. to adopt the proposals contained in the Report of the Relief of Distress Committee, including. &apos;.&apos; the suggestion-.ln Paragraph 9 to the effect&apos; that the best course will be to have a prelim-, inary discussion of the scheme with repr esenl;-atives of Employers and Employed.., -and that an effort should be made before the&quot;Introduction of a Bill -to; secure ,-subs:t-.z.&quot;&apos;:.&apos;s.o.l support of the principle ^.which&apos;the schGcie eabodioso &apos;-2-.   &apos;  - - .      &apos; &apos;&apos;

In relief of unemployment of a non-revenue producing, vcharacter for half the period of the loan and have agreed&apos;with the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the Government share of the loan charges . should he increased from 50$ to 65$. Circulars to local authorities have been issued by the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Office to this effect.In the- case of revenue producing works there has been no alteration In the original decision of the Committee which was communicated to local authorities in the Minis try-, of- Health circular of 22nd September, 1921, that grants vrould be paid equivalent to 50$ of the interest only for a period of 5 years on loans raised; for a period of not less than 10 years.1 -Lord St. David8* Committee,-     :    The Committee have decided to allocate to Lord St. Davids1 Committee out of a aum not..exceeding  10,000,000 sterling which&apos;:the: Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed to provide for the purpose of relief measures&apos; other than&apos;&apos;those &quot;specified in the preceding paragraph, a- further&quot; grant, of &apos;  6.00* 000 to -be used - inter;&quot;alia for assisting^ local&apos;authorities -who decide-to finance their schemes out of rates and not by way of. loansi
It has teen agreed to place at the disposal of the Forestry Commission a sum of  850,000 to relieve agricultural unemployment which is expectec to &quot;become increasingly severe.    The details of the scheme are sot out in a.Memorandum by&apos; the Forestry Commission (C.TJ.253). It is hoped that employment may in some oases be available for men. from urban areas contiguous to land suitable for planting, and in certain special districts viz:    the Forest of Dean.The Scheme also provides for negotiations with local authorities for the clearance cf brush-wood from land suitable for planting, the local authority providing the labour and tailing the brush-wood without charge .It is expected that the Forestry programme will find employment for at. least 3*500 men for six months&quot;, in addition to any employment that may be found by local authorities on the brush-wood clearing- scheme;The details of the scheme submitted by tho forestry commission will bo examined by an inter-dspartmehtalCommittee under the Chairmanship of the Minister ofAgriculture, which is charged with the duty of seeing that(i) . Any sums allocated to the Forestry Commission for expenditure by their own1 organisations,or &apos; to be used by way of grants to private land-owners, are spent within th\? ensuing twelve months. the bulk offii)    That/the money shall be spent in wages&apos;fiii)    That tho money shall -be - allocated for the purpose of providing vtotk in districts where nncmployment- is severe rather than for carrying out plans which the Forestry Commission would naturally put into-operation in pursuance ..   of their forestry policy apart from the question - -: &apos; -of unemployment.^&apos;   v -:
(d) Roads.

(i) The Committee have considered the proposals of the Ministry of Transport to undertake further road work(C.U. 234). Applications from local authorities in districts which have been certified by the Ministry of Labour as districts in which unemployment is severe have been received by the Ministry of Transport, involving an expenditure of £1,289,462 in respect ? road construction in the London sucurban area, the provinces, in wales and in Scotland. The Committee have agreed ? of the cost of such road work shall be met by the Government.

It is understood that the local authorities will be prepared to co-operate on this basis.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes that a large part of the cost to the State shall be met out of the balance of the Road Fund. Negotiations between the Treasury and the Ministry of Transport on the exact amount are proceeding. It is expected by this means to find additional employment for 7,000 men for six months at a cost to the State of £645,000.

(ii) In districts not yet certified by the Ministry of Labour as suffering from an excessive amount of unemployment further road works to an amount of £2,000,000 are being investigated with the local authorities, and will be available if and when necessary.

(iii) Further schemes are under consideration for providing road work to relieve unemployment in the river-side and other districts of London by undertaking the construction of the London-Tilbury road, a new road to Southend,the extension of the new Cambridge road in Hertfordshire, and the widening and improvement of roads in the parts of North Kent within easy reach of London.

The Labour for these schemes would be drawn from the S.E. Metropolitan Boroughs where unemployment is acutely felt.


The total cost of such schomes would be in the region of   ,.431,000 and they would find employment for 10,000 men for seven months.     Inasmuch, however, as the unemployed men put on the work would be drawn from districts other than those through which the roads pass, there is difficulty in securing contributions from the County Councils and Borough Councils.-.The Committee, have decided that the Ministry-of Transportshall put further pressure on the local authorities-concerned to contribute: but if these schemes are to dependfor their operation on contributions from the London and con-tiguous municipal, authorities they are not likely to be pro-ceeded with.    In view of the serious -unemployment in the EastEnd of London,&apos; the.,,Committee suggestthat it is worthy -of consideration whether these schemes should not-be undertaken at the expense of tho Exchequer.(e ) Land /drainage. ... .&apos;   The&apos;.Committee have- agreed to allocate  650;000 to theMinister of Agriculture for schemes of Land -Drainage inEngland and Wales, as set out in his Memorandum (C.U,349),It is proposed to offer to Drainage Boards in England andWales- a grant of 55$ of the total cost of schemes for clear-ing- rivers-, water courses and ditches/unemployment labour which it is hoped will alleviate unemployment in agricul-tural areas, and also give employment to a certain number ofmen from .Urban areas,, The Drainage Boards and RatingAuthorities.have compulsory powers of- rating, and theremaining- 35$-. will. hp-..met by rates, levied on riparian owners and. others who benefit by tho works-   Smaller schemes willbe -undertaken by the County Agricultural&apos;Committees,-and
and a. proportion of the cost,, -(not leas tha.n 35$., and inmany -oases   as much as 50$) recovered by agreement fromthe land ovmors who benefit from the work,.   It is. expected to find employment for 10,00,0 men- for six months ata cost to the 3tat.o not exooeding  650*000 a substantial part of which will be recoverable.The Committee have also agreed to allocate a sumequivalent to ll/80ths of the  inglish grant (approximately 90,000) to the Secretary for Sootland to be devoted to similar work in Scotland^(f) Idght, Hallways.The attention of the Committee has been directed to proposals for the construction of Light Hallways in Northin the neighbourhood ox Devon,, Soiith Wales *nd/J&quot;Jingwall, arees where unemployment is now, or is likely to be^ severeo (GcTLt 193 and  59), Whilethe Committee are not in n position to make any definiterecommendations on the particular proposals in questionwithout further information.as to the extent to which the promoters and local interests will eoircribute, they considerthat the question of tile offer In some iuxid or otner offinancial assistance by the State for n-Vit Kaiiwa^ SchemesIs worthy of further ..exploration, a,u.o. they recommend .:-That a sum of  200,000 should be placed at the disposal -of the Minister of Transport for the development of light. Railway undertakings of an approved cha.xe&amp;ter*.(g)* Overseas Set-ul&amp;montcThe Committee recommendedThat a further sum of  3^0,000 be allocated -for the assistance if Overseas Settlement, ihe.details to be settled by the Treasury and the Overseas Settlement C ommitt-c-.
9 03.TH3 REVIVAL OF TRADE./(a)   ?llc Gai rloch&apos;, Schcmo .The Committoe. nave had under consideration theproposal submitted to. tho Prime Minister at Gairlcch by Commander Hilton Young&apos;s Committee (C.P.3363), and in particular have had regard to&apos; the following paragraphs in the Report:- - .. &apos;&quot;7 . . A Committoe consisting of a small number (say five) of representatives of industry, labour and,finance should bo established with authority tc assist, within the limits of the financial powers conferred upon, them, (l) the promotion at home cf capital works (including undertakings ancillary or incidental thereto) that Will be of ultimate benefit to the nation and will provide employment, such works to be undertaken by local authorities, public utility companies or private enterprises;    (?.) the placing .-.of- oroers in this market from, the British Empire and Foreign countries for works of a similar nature. In the.case of foreign countries the scheme could be &quot;worked in conjunction with the Tor 1-eulen project. In all cases such, assistance would, when desirable, take the form of a guarantee.&quot;&quot;11.    To counteract the evils of possible inflation .a Government loan should be - raised-to be styled &quot;National Development. Loan&quot; to be applied firstly to tho financing of tho-schemes in question and for&apos;, the protection of guarantees given by the Government for the purpose of -such financing.   Any unexpended balance to fall into the Consolidated Fund.&quot;The Committee have also had before them a Memorandum, submitted by the Treasury (CTJj 274-) i in which it is suggested that power should be given to guarantee interest and Sinking Funds on loans to approved railways and other undertakings&apos;which cannot otherwise obtain funds, and that the annual liability under the Government guarantee be limited to a sum not exceeding in all (say)  1,000,000 per annum.The Committee understand from the Treasury that in effect this would limit the total capital cost of assisted undertakings to  ?l5 millions sterling.    The &quot;Committee further understand that the Treasury on consider-, ation are of opinion that the proposal submitted at Gair-loch, regarding the raising of a loan should, not be proceeded - ith.
and accordingly that paragraph 11 of the GairlochReport quoted above which recommends a NationalDevelopment Loan, should not be adopted.The Committee advise the Cabinet(1) That In order to confer upon the proposed Committee the greatest freedom of action, Para. 7 (1) of the Gairloch Report should be amended to road as follows:**(1)   The promotion at home of apTaroy^ucapital works (Including undertakings anoifrlary or Incidental thereto) that will be of ultimate benefit to the&apos;; nation and will provide employment, (It will be noted that the alterations comprise the inclusion of the word &quot;approved&quot;- and the omission of the words &quot;such wdrks to bo undertaken by . looal authorities., pub 110 utility &apos;&apos; oompanles Or private enterprises(2)   That In the5.r opinion the offer of a guartuite^ of Interest alone will prevent Important schemes from being submitted which would possibly be attracted by the offer of a capital investment by the Government^(Mr. Baldwin and Commander Hilton Young i desire to record their dissent from this recommendation,(3)   That the financial limits contemplated by the Treasm^y are entirely inadequate for the objects In vietr.(4)   That the proposal for the issue of a loan to be called trie &quot;National and Empire Development Loan&quot; should be further explored^(b)   Export CroditsaThe Committee have had before them a proposal that xne Exports credits scheme should be extended to all countriee, except those excluded by administrativeiaction^- and that the period covered by the Scheme should be extended from a maximum of 3 years, to a maximum of 6 years.    This proposal has been adopted.Tho Committee understand that their previous unanimous decision that the share of the Government risk should be increased from 50$ of the uncovered risk to 75/o, and that the scheme should be administered through
the Banks, has been.rejotrta^advice of the Prosldent of the Board of Trade, on theground that the Banks are ot opinion that no-extension,of the scheme will lead to legitimate business*The Committee recommendThat in view of the great divergence of opinion, on the subject, and of the fact that many industries cannot be brought within the ambit of the scheme for the construction of capital works, the question of increasing the percentage of Government risk in the FxportsCredits Scheme should be further explored.us.-10-
Co) Accelaration of Government Contracts, and other &quot;Dndortaki^a-^-^ -Th9 contracting Departments have been circularised on the quostion to what axtont they can accelerate purohasos of Government stores, but rsports are not yet available.The Committae are informed that if a revision of Estimates;is oontamplated, Government Departments are&quot;In, a position to undertake various works (including works which hafce been aban-abandoned on ths- ground&apos; of economy) which would provide consider-. able employment, for axample *- th3 Imperial wireless Telegraphy Scheme and the Post Office Tube .     The Committee recommend -that a Sub-Committee should be set up to advise -(l) Which of these works should be\undertaken.(2), To what extent the purchase of Government stores should be accelerated.(d) Indian Railway Devalopmont.The Committee understand that communications are now taking place between the India Office and the Viceroy as to -the possibility of arranging for tho Treasury to finance contracts placed in this country for tho Indian Railways by means of Treasury Bills, to be met ultimately by remittances from the Indian Govarnmont.     The Committee have received from Mr. Goodenough detailed particulars of these proposals and they earnestly hope that means may bo found by arrangement between the two Governments by which these orders, which may amount to  50,.000,000,are secured for this-country.
/(o) Imperial Development.- The Committoo have received a Memorandum from the Secretary of Stato for the Colonies (CcU*268) on the question of immediate orders being placed in this oountry on behalf of the Ouown Colonies and Protectorates, to the  , amount of over  8,000,000, if financial assistance in some form could ho afforded by the Imperial Exchequer.     The Memorandum suggests that it would be advisable if a total, sum of  2,000,000 spread over 2 years could be earmarked   -for assisting certain Colonies to meet the loan charges, at any rate in the first two years, and to enable grants to be mado to some of the poorer Colonies offering good prospects Of development, which are not in a position to issue Loans on their own aooount.The Committee understand that the whole matter is tho subject of further enquiry by the Colonial Office, and. theydo not therefore  E.L in a position to make any recommendationat present       1 &quot; \     &apos; . ./on the subject. ;

OOtolTTTEK.REPORT^, .1*     At a Mooting on Sth October, 1921; (Cabinet 76.(21 j Conclusion (3)) tho Cabinet approved in principle the Report of tho Conference between the Prime Minister-,,&apos; , the Lord Privy Seal and the Cabinet Committee on. Unemployment.The 6th recommendation in this Report reads asfOllOWSJ-. (6)   To set up a Committee io consider and     , advise the Cabinet as to the practical .  bility and expediency for raising from those persons who are so fortunate as to be employed, a special compulsory distress levy of 2d, a week from the workmen, 2d, from the employer, and possibly 2d, from the State, for the purpose of forming a Distress Fund providing for wives and children for rhom the Unemployment Benefit of 15/- a week for the husband will not make sufficient provision, The Committee to advise as to the best manner in which the Fund should be spent, i.e*, hy grants in money or in kind, through the agency of the Local Authorities, bearing in mind that grants of relief in kind would probably be most economical.     The Committee to consist ofThe Right Hon* R. Munro, K.C., M.P., (in the Chair) The Right Hon* C.A. McCurdy, K.C., M,P,,; Sir 5.Mitchell-Thomson, Bt., K.B.E., M.P., The Right Hon.

2-..    (l)  T&amp;evacpE&amp;U^&amp;M &apos;;tof%*otffeepenoe^to them in light of a statement- made byi **. the Parllaiiiefetary Secretary to the Ministry of Labourandrr^ocaMmend to the Cabinet -That it is expedient that for a limited period of, say six months, a Distress Fund should be raised by means of v contributions from employed persons,their employers and the State.(2)   The Committee are impressed on the one hand with the administrative difficulties of extending the scheme to persons not. employed in trades Insured agains&quot;t unemployment, and on the other with the fact that this limitation will exclude agriculture and domestic service.After full consideration the Committee recommend r(1)   That the contributions should be levied only from trades insured against unemployment.(2)   That in the event of agricultural unem-ployment becoming serious, the&apos; Cabinet should give separate consideration to &quot; the a agricultural aspects of the problem^(3)   That the Distress Fund should be applied for the benefit of wives and children of men in receipt of Unemployment Benefit . ; Of &apos;15/j- a week.3.     In connection with the above the Committee&apos;attention has been drawn to the statement in paragraph 36of the Final Report of Lord Aberconway&apos;s Carrimittee onOut-of-Work Donation (Cmd 305 of 1919) to the effectthat the payment of supplementary donation for dependent children is out of place and leads to undesirable resultsThe Committee consider that the greater gravity of thepresent unemployment situation as compared with thesituation at the d ate of the Report in qiestion and theand the Donation scheme difference between the proposed scheme/justify the excep-tional treatment - of depen&amp;e-ut- chi-Idren- on the lines indicated in this Report.

Tile eost of.administration is estimated -at 10$ so that roughly  1701,000 a week could be devoted to benefits.

39 0The OooBdJtrfce^ with the- gravity of theorisia and also with the unpri^o&amp;ai^^ ike.scheme proposed.     They are of opinion that the jusfclfltfia/tdaaof any such scheme would he that It should yield suhstantialresults..     They recognise the* imp^trtanoe of securingthe support of public opinion and they feel doubtful whether Scheme &quot;A^ would obtain such support.They accordingly recommend -(1)   That the scheme should be based on the contributions indicated ..jnLjkjheme &quot;B&quot; above,(2)   That the benefits should be either 5/- a week for a wife 1/- a week for each child; ,or alternatively 4/*- a week for &amp; wife, and i/6d, a week for each child.5*     The Committee wish to draw attention to the facts that (1) the increased cost to tho Exohequer of,Scheme &quot;B&apos;T over Scheme        is roughly about  1,000,000 for the--. 6 months; (2) if the benefits of the scheme are to be increased, this can only be done by :incroasing the rates of contribution, and (3) that a suggestion has beenImade to them that far - moro popular support would be -accorded to a distress levy scheme designed on more horois lines, and giving substantially higher benefits to.wives and children even than are contemplated in Scheme &quot;B&quot; above, (4) under tho existing Health and Unemployment Schemes for men the total contributions.from employers and employed weekly amount to 25d. while:the contributions from the State weekly to both sohemes together amount only to 6d.
,&amp;*w &quot;The T34ma ttee&apos; reoomneaad---(1) That contributions should be collected by means of cards and stamps on the analogy of Health and Unemployment insurance, and should be carried out through the Labour Esiyhange3 and the Post Office, the Ministry of Labour being responsible for the administration of the schema.(2) That the carcls and stamps should be kept s quite distinct from those used forUnemployment Insurance purposes.(3) That every effort should be made to secure that Employers should assist in making the scheme a sue seas in such matters as the obtaining and filling up of the cards, etc.(4) That sanction should be given forthwith to jprint the necessary cards and stamps in advahoe of any legislation which may be necessary.       The scheme can on that footing be put in operation within four weeks&apos; time of the order to print..7.     The Committee have carefully considered whetherthe benefits of the scheme should be confined to per-sons who are not only unemployed but are also desti-tute.       While fully appreciating the desirabilityof conserving the fund as much...as. po^ihlaJiy^JJjmltingthe grants to persons really in need of them, theCommittee consider that an unemployed person receivingonly 15/-* a weak benefit, may probably be treated asin urgent need of assistance if he has a wife andchildren to support.     Moreover, the adoption of thisview would greatly simplify administration.     Anydestitution test could in practice be applied only by the boards of Guardians &quot;or local Authorities or special ad hoc bodies.       This would involve,    theCommittee are informed, complexity and indeedconfusion in administration.On these grounds the Committee recommend  That no special destitution test should be imposed.

The Committee, while fully appreciating the advantage of a system of grants in kind, are impressed with the many practical difficulties inseparable from suoh an arrangement, land they accordingly recommend the Cabinet -To adopt the principle of money ^grants payable by way of supplement to the unemployment Benefit&quot;:THE BIPED-   9,LMCY 0? IHTBQDOO-&quot; LNGr ANSOHBKBIt has been represented to the Committee that any scheme for imposing a compulsory distress levy in presentcircumstances is almost oertain to excite strong oppesit- -OS SHE        J BOW ,U3 E&amp;dsm in Parliament, and from Employers and workpeoplegenerally and may in itself cause further unemployment,and that it might be preferable to provide the money required for the scheme by an addition to the Incometax.   The Committee wish to draw the attention of theCabinet to this aspeot of the matter and torecommend -That, while1, in view of the Oontaittee ik scheme oh the lines indicated above is at the present time practicable and expedient, the best course would be to have a pre-11mlnary lisoussien of the soheme with representatives of Employers and Employed; and that an effort should be made before the introduction of a Bill ttt secure substantial support ef the principle which it ambodies.ftUESTIOKS OP DETAIL.10*   The Otmmittee recommend -That any questions of detail which may arise on the soheme should be left for settlement by the Treasury and the .
