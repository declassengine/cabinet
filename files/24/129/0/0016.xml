We suggest publication in England if yon think advisable.From Viceroy, Home Department, llth October 1921.We considered in Council yesterday letter from Madras Government regarding the situation in Malabar. The Madras Government state that, throughout the interior of Ernad and Walluvanad Taluks, there are a number of armed bodies of Moplahs openly waging active war against the British Government, that these bodies are estimated to include 8,000 to 10,000 men, that their policy is to lie in ambush and snipe at the troops and to avoid open encounter, that they have spies everywhere, that their information about the movements of our troops is very much better than any information our troops are able to obtain, and that tliey are to a great extent masters of the country, and attack and plunder Hindu houses and maltreat the inmates as they will. Outside this area more isolated cases of looting and forcible conversion by wandering gangs alone occur, but the Moplah population is in a sullen and uncertain frame of mind. The Madras Government urge, therefore, that systematic military measures, with adequate forces, are absolutely necessary, mid that it is a necessary and inevitable corollary to such measures that means should be provided for the speedy trial and punishment of those taken in arms against the troops or found actively assisting those fighting against His Majesty&apos;s forces. Elicited (sic) belief of the chief local civil officers is that the rebels are being materially (? fortified) in their resolute defence by the absence of all provision for speedy trial and punishment. They report further that the ordinary Hindu population do not understand the policy 4747      100   10.21
-that relegates the Moplahs caught spying or suspected of leading the troops into ambush to Calicut, with the possibility oi: further proceedings on appeal, and consequently they shrink from rendering any active assistance to the authorities or troops. The Madras Government are not unmindful of the probability of political criticism or of considerations that may be adduced from Punjab experiences, but consider that no reasonable parallel can be drawn between the happenings of 1919 in the Punjab and the organised rebellion now continuing in Malabar, and they urge that the proposed Summary Coxirts-Martial are only the ordinary and appropriate accompaniments of regular warfare, which is what the happenings in Malabar have become. Madras Ministers, who have been consulted, are in full agreement with the -need for a Summary Court with full powers to try without appeal rebels taken in arms or persons found guilty of actively assisting rebels in field. They would prefer, however, the Coiirtto consist exclusively of civilian Judges. Their objection is based on political considerations and not on distrust of impartiality of military Judges, and Madras Government consider it would not be possible to arrange for special tribunal of Judges to acconrpany troops in active warfare.2. As yoxi are aware, additional troops have already been despatched to Malabar, and we are informing the Madras Government that any further troops required by them will be sent, and enquiring whether extra military forces are in fact needed. We are aiso informing them that we attach great importance to the strengthening of police and to the effective occupation by the police of areas cleared by troops ; that we have already sanctioned the issue of 350 magazine rifles to the special police force being raised,.and will sanction the issue of such other armament as the Madras Government consider necessary. In addition, however, we have decided, in view of reasons adduced by Madras Government, and which we regard as convincing, to issue an Ordinance providing for trial, where considered necessary, by the Military Commander, or by an officer, not being below the rank of a field officer, empowered by the Military Commander in this behalf in writing, of persons guilty of offences under sections 121 and 122 of the Indian Penal Code, and of aiding and abetting such offences, of offences under section 302, Indian Penal Code, if committed in connection with offences necessitating the enforcement or continuance of martial law, of spying or harbouring rebels and of any other offence notified in this behalf by the Local Government with the sanction of the Governor-General in Council. Terms of Ordinance will be telegraphed as soon as piacticable.We are also informing Madras Government that they should consider whether,, simultaneously with the issue of this Ordinance, a Proclamation should noc issue offering terms of amnesty to persons not guilty of grave crimes or violence.The Home Member is proceeding on the 13th to Madras to confer with the Local Government and the military authorities regarding the measures required to deal &quot;with the situation.
