It is not yet possible to say that peace is firmly established in Europe, and it must be long before the world can recover from the strain and sacrifice of the Ear; but good progress has been made towards the solution of the most critical problems of home and foreign affairs.I have welcomed with deep satisfaction the Prime Ministers of the Dominions and the Representatives of India., who have been in Conference -*;ith Ey Advisers here.   They had questions of great moment to discuss in common and grave decisions to make.   Their presence for that purpose has been invaluable, and I trust that it may be found possible to arrange regular meetings of a like character for the further exchange of views and the discussion of common interests.Their deliberations on foreign policy dealt in particular -with the problems of the Pacific and-Par East and with the questions arising out of the Empire:s obligations under the Treaty of Versailles and the other Treaties of Peace.     I am happy to know that on all those issues My Governments here and oversea are in close accord,,TheB C H B To
The Conference&apos; gav-e serious attention to the defence of the Empire end the maintenance of an adequate measure of sea-power.    It was unanimously decided that the naval strength of the Empire should be equal to that of any other Power. -As a result of the proposals- made by the allied Powers to Cermany last T-ay and accepted by her, satisfactory progress has been made by the German Government in the execution of their financial and disarmament obligations under the&apos; Treaty ox VersaillesA serious rising of the. Poles in Upper Silesia led to tho British troops which had been withdrawn in April,, being sent bach, and after difficult and ansious negotiations the insurrection was overcome, and tho authority of the International Commission was re-established.The insurrection unfortunately delayed the negotiations for a settlement of the frontier-,- and at ,a meeting of the Allied and Associated Powers in Paris in August last, it was decided to invite the League of Hations to examine the whole cuestion and to make recommendations &apos; for a settlement,Those recommendations have recently been received and steps are being taken to give effect to them. There is reason to hope that they will be loyally carried out by the two parties principally concerned, and that a peaceful and honourable settlement will result.
Peace has been definitely established between the Allied Powers and Hungary.     The Treaty signed at Trianon on June 4th, 1980, having been ratified by the British Empire, Prance, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia, Serbia, Rounania, Siam and Hungary the ratifications were deposited at the French ministry for foreign Affairs on July 26th last.The tranqullity of Central Europe has. recently again been disturbed by the attempt of the ex-i:ing of Hungary to return to that country. :   The efforts of tne Allied Powers to avoid at all costs a breach of the peace, coupled with the correct attitude of the established Government in Hungary, have, I hope, led to a peaceful solution.     The e^-lCing is in custody on board one of     &quot;ships, and will-be transported to a destination which has not yet been definitely fixed.     The Hungarian Government are about to declare his forfeiture of the Throve, and thet of all members of the Hapsburg dynasty.The efforts, made by My government at the Allied Conference in Harch and renewed in June, to,, establish peace in the near East were in each case i rendered fruitless by the renewed outbreak of hostilities between tho CJreefc and Turicish forced in Anatolia.     It is my earnest desire to see these hostilities followed by on early and just peace, and liy Government are prepared in conjunction with their Allies to ta/ce the fivst opportunity of furthering this end.
I have followed with great satisfaction tho stops taJcon by the President of the United States to promote the reduction of expenditure on armaments, an object.which commands the fullest sympathy of my Government.It was in this spirit that my Government gladly accepted the invitation e ,tended by the United States Government to a Conference on Disarmament about to bo held at Washington.    It is my earnest hope that the labours of the Conference, will ba crowned with success.negotiations have for some time been :in progress but have not yat reached a conclusion between my Government and a delegation nominated by H.H. tho Sultan ox -v.gypt .with a -View to. determine the future relationship of that country with Groat Britain.Progress continues to bo m de in the reduction of expenditure in Iraq in accordance with the . pal icy which has been&apos;-explained in the House-.&apos;
IgQPPwS .0F TOPS HOUSE OP OOWMOITSoI thank you for the prevision for iho public service and ihe redemption of debt.   Although trade and commerce have been undergoing hi period of unexampled depression, I learn with satisfaction that it is nevertheless anticipated that* while the estimated surplus for redemption of debt will not be realised,, the financial year will end without a deficit on the Budget.Our debts, however, are great, our taxation heavy and burdensome to industry, and revenue   cannot be maintained on the scale of the last three years.   It is, accordingly,*of vital importance to the finanoial stability of the country that expenditure should be at,21 further restricted in every departnent of life, both public and private   The Government will continue to take advantage of every possible means to achieve this essential object in the field of public expenditure, and 1 confidently rely upon Ly people in their own practice to support the efforts of tiy Ministers.HY LORDS   AKD HHIv-BERS 01 TO HOUSE OP cbn;017S.-The situation in Ireland still causes l&quot;.&apos;e great anxiety.   I earnestly exhort the&apos;leaders of all Parties in Ireland,, and all those in whose hands lies the por&apos;er to influence the negotiations and discussions now proceeding to exercise patience and moderation wiih the object of establishing friendship and lcyal co-operation between ly peoples.   It is ly firm belief, as it is ly earnest prayer, that with forbearance and goodwill and with an honest resolve to tread the paths of oblivion and for-givenese, an enduring peace will finally be achieved.a    5    **
Tha past summer lias &quot;been notable for the occurrence of the most serious/industrial conflict&apos;whioh haa over menaced the prosperity Cf &quot;the. realm.     I take pride in the calm and bereno spirit with which the trials of tho coal stoppage were met by My people., and the freedom from strife and. vidlence which characterised its course.-This dispute unhappily aggravated tlie adverse effect of the Budden world-wide trade depression, which has inflicted upon the industries of this country the most grievous experience in their history,My Ministers have viewed with grave concern the continuance of the widespread Unemployment which has attend-ed the cessation of trade..   Aocordingly you have within the past few weeks&apos; given close and detailed consideration to this problem...     Measures have received&apos; My assent designed, firstly, to encourage the revival of industry by facilitat-ing the provision of Capital for public undertakings and by assisting export trade, and,, secondly, directly to provide employment on an extended scale by -aiding Local Authorities and others to carry out various forms of bonoficial works,     Finally, in addition to the provision -made by the Acts which you hare already passed relating to Unemployment Insurance, a measure has been framed to assist in mitigating the sufferings of those who remain unemployed., by. the provision, out of monies contributed by employers, employed and the State, t*f grants to wives and dependent children.
The peaceful settlement of. many difficult       disputes by mutual negotiation between employers and workpeople together with&apos;some indications of a revival of trade encourage My hope-that the vcrst may bo over and that the state of employment may shew from now onwards a steady, if slow, improvement.   But the position is still full of anricty and My Ministers will continue to devote to this problem their vigilant care.It is not, h^7e7or, so much to .r.ots&apos;cf Parliament as to the proved good sense of employers and operatives, working together for the promotion of their common Interests, that I look for the restoration of trade prosperity.My assent has also been given to Measures for the &apos; reorganisation of the&quot; railvays and for the saf guarding of industry and an Act for tho Reform of the licensing laws has been passed with an universal and gratifying measure of agree-ment.     But tho   legislation of the Session has been dominated by the difficult financial condition of the time.   The impera-tlve need for the avoidance of all fresh burdens, and for the further ourtailmont of expenditure has required the modifica-fion of some measures already pass ad and tho postponement to-happier times of the oomplotion of other reforms.I pray that the blessing   of clmighty God may rest upon year labours^.hitehall Gardens, S. 4th November, 1021.
