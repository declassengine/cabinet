Tho Assembly adopts the following resolutions:1. The resolutions and the proposals for amendments t&apos;oArticle 16 which have been adopted by&apos; the Assembly shall,   so long as the amendments have not been put In force in the form required by the Covenant,, constitute rules for guidance vhich the Assembly recommends, as a provisional measure, to the Council and. to the Members of the League; in connection with the application of Article 1.6.2, Subject to the special provisions of Article 17,the economic measures referred to in Article 16 shall be applicable only in specific case referred to in this Article.3, The unilateral action of the defaulting State cannotcreate a state of war:    it merely.entitles the ether Members of the League to resort to acts of war or to declare themselves in a state of war with the Covenant-breaking State;   but, It is in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant that the League of Nations should attempt, at least at the outset, to avoid war, and to restore peace by economic pressure.4. It is the duty of each Member of the League to decide for Itself whether a. breach of the Covenant has been committed,. The fulfilment Qf their duties under Article 16 Is required from Members of the League by the express terms of the Covenant, and they cannot neglect &apos;them without breach of their Treaty obligations.5, All cases of breach of Covenant under Article 16shall be referred to the Council as a matter of urgency at the request of any Member of the League.     Further, If a breach of Covenant be committed, or if there arise a danger of such breach being committed, the Secretary-General shall at once give notice thereof to all the Members of the Council..    Upon receipt of such a request by a Member of the League, or of such a notice by the Secretary-General,1 the Council will meet as soon as possible..     The Council shall summon representatives of the parties to the conflict and of all States which are neighbours of the defaulting State, or which normally maintain close economic relations with it, or whose co-operation would be especially valuable for the application of Article 16,6. If the Council is of opinion that a State has been guilty of a breach of Covenant, the Minutes of the meeting-at which that opinion is arrived at shall be immediately sent to all Members of the League, accompanied by a statement of reasons and by an invitation to take action accordingly/^     The fullest publicity shall be given to this decision,7.        For the purpose of assisting it to enforce Article 16, the Council may if it thinks fit, be assisted by a technical Committee.     This Committee, which will remain in permanent session as soon as the action decided on is taken, may include, if desirable, representatives of the States specially affected.
8.        The Council shall recommend the date on which the enforcement of economic pressure, under Article 16, is to be begun, and shall give notice of that date to all the Members of the League,9.        All States must be treated alike as regards the application of the measures of economic pressure, with the following reservations;(a) It may be necessary to recommend the execution of special measures by certain States;(b) If it is thought desirable to postpone, wholly or partially, in the case of certain States, the effective application of the economic sanctions laid down In Article 16, such postponement shall not be permitted except in so far as It Is desirable for the success of the common plan of action, or reduces to a minimum the losses and embarrassments which may be entailed in the case of cert in Members of ihe League by the application of the sanctions.10.       It is not possible to decide beforehand, and in detail the various measures of an economic, commercial and financial nature to be taken in each case vhore &quot;economic pressure Is to be applied.When the case arises, the Council shall recommend, to the Members of the League a plan for Joint action.11.       The interruption of diplomatic relations may, in the first place, be limited to the withdrawal of the heads of Missions,12.       Consular relations may possibly be maintained,13.       For the purpose of the severance of relations between persons belonging to the Covenant-breaking State and persons belonging to other States Members of the League, the test shall be residence and not nationality.14.       In cases of prolonged application of economic pressure measures of increasing stringency may be taken.     The cutting off of the fogdaeupplies of the civil population of the defaulting State/be regarded as an extremely drastic measure which shall only be applied if the other measures available are clearly inadequate.15.       Correspondence and all other methods of communication shall be subjected to special regulations.16.     Humanitarian relations shall be oontlnued.17,       Efforts should bo made to arrive at arrangements which viov-ld ensure the co-operation of States non-Members of the League in the measures to be taken.18.       In special circumstances and In support of economic measures to be taken, it may become advisable:    (a) to establish, an effective blockade of the seaboard of the Covenant-breaking&apos; State;    (b) to entrust to some Members of the League the execution of the blockade operations.
19. .     The Council shall urge upon all the States Members of the League that:.their-Governments should take the necessary preparatory measures, above all of a legislative character, to enable them to enforco at short notice the necessary measures of economic pressure.(Resolutions adopted on October 4th, 1921)* * s 0 * v s * *
British Delegation,Hotel Beau Rivage,- -    ; &apos;.. .Geneva.. .&apos; &apos; Mr.&apos;Balfour presents his compliments to the Secretary to the Cabinet and begs to state that at tho close of the discussion in the Plenary Meeting of the Assembly on October 5th of the Report of the Committee on Article Id of the Covenant, dealing with tho enforcement of the Economic Blockade, he agreed verbally- with the French Delegation that; neither Government would.ratify the amendments to the Covenant whioh this Report involves.before the next meeting of the Assembly.   He also agree vyith tho French Delegation that the two Governments should act in common on this.question.The reason which led-Mr. balfour to agree to this French proposal was that some confusion arose towards the end of tbe debate as\to .the exact nature ,of tho action which was being-taken-.   Towards the close cf the discussion of this Report on the previous day, the Dutch Delegation had proposed that, in view of the bomplexity attaching: to some of the points, the whole subject should be adjourned until the third Assembly so as to give time-for further study upon certain points.   At tlliio commencement of, the; discussion on October 5th, the Chairman and Rapporteur of the&apos; &quot;Committee submitted a proposal that the recommendations-,and proposed: amendments embodied, in the Report which had-bean accepted -by the - Assembly should be regarded as provisionally in force this . suggestion was accepted, by many Delegations, including the French and British, upon the assump-tlon that it qpha^itiite^l an addition to-the proposal of the 13 other lands Deloga-ti on and. was not in substitution for it,.: It subsequently transpired that: it was intended ;to bo a -subs tit -tj on.    The two Delegations :fouh:dthemselves, therefore, in a position of having accepted: -certain- proposals which they thought were feeing adjourned until--next.,year..   As( no
amendment can come into force until, tho French and&apos; British Governments, as Members, of the Council, have ratified it, the. agreoment which Itr. Balfour has mode, and which is indicated in the- first paragraph of this note, will prevent any harm arising-, and the question cen be reconsidered, if necessary, at the. next meeting, of tho Assembly.6th October, ,1921.
