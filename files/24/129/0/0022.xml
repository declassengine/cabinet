SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.Cabinet Unemployment Committee,The prospect of a severe trade. depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemplovment.[7137]-
This Committee has since been in constant session and has up to the 17th October, 1921, held 34 meetings.The problem of unemployment in one form or another has also been before the Cabinet on 50 occasions between the 13th August, 1920, and the 17th October, 1921.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope was introduced on the 23rd December, 1919, reintroduced on the 16th February, 1920, received a Third Reading in the Commons on the 19th July, 1920, passed into law on the 9th August, 1920, and came into operation on the 8th November, 1920.This Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. The weekly rates of benefit, paid out of contributions from employers, employed and the State, were 15s. for men and 12s. for women, after a &quot;waiting period &quot; of three days. In general, the amount of benefit was limited to one week for every six contributions paid, but during the first year eight weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn after four contributions had been paid.An Amending Act of.the 23rd December, 1920. granted eight weeks&apos; benefit, up to the 31st March,. 1921, to persons who had paid no contributions but had been employed for a certain minimum period in an insured trade in 1920.A farther Amending Act of the 3rd March, 1,921, increased the rate of benefit to 20s. for men and 16s. for women. It further provided that during each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July 1922 1.6 weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn by persons who had been employed in an insured trade in 20 weeks since the end of 1919 and were normally employed in an insured trade genuinely seeking whole-time employment and unable to obtain it.A third Amending Act of the 1st July, 1921, reduced the rate of benefit to 15s. for men and 12s. for women and increased the &quot; waiting period-&quot; to six days. This change was necessitated by exhaustion of funds owing to the great amount of unemployment and was coupled with a heavy increase in contributions and authority to borrow money from the Treasury to the extent of  20,000,000, as compared with  10,000,000 previously. At the same time power was taken to allow 22 weeks&apos; benefit (instead of 16) in each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July 1922.Between the 8th November, 1920, and the 8th October, 1921, the amount paid in unemployment benefit was  47,950,000. Of this amount the contribution of employers since the 8th November was  8,575,000, that of employed persons  8,001,000 and that of the State  4,272,000, in addition to  1,518,000 &quot;in respect of benefit for ex-regular sailors, soldiers and airmen. The balance was provided mainly out of the - accumulated reserve fund of over 20 millions, and there was a deficit on the 8th October of  4,485,000 covered by loan from the Treasury.The number of persons in receipt of benefit was on the 1st July. 1921, 2,062,012 wholly unemployed and 988,364 on part-time, and on the 7th October, 1921, 1,100,237 wholly unemployed and 308;063 on part-time.(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A sum of  10,400,000 was provided for expenditure on arterial roads, half to be given by way of actual grant and half by way of a loan to Local Authorities. This money is administered by the Ministry of Transport and is expended by Local Authorities under their supervision. The men to be employed are selected by the Local Employment Committee of the Employment Exchange and preference is given to ex-Service-men.A further sum of  3,000,000 was allocated to the Unemployment Grants Committee, presided over by Lord St. Davids, for the purpose of assisting Local Authorities to carry out at once works on. which a substantial number of unemployed could be engaged. The conditions imposed with regard to the expenditure of this money were that works could only be approved in areas where there existed serious unemployment which was not otherwise provided for, that the men employed should be taken from the registers of the. Employment Exchanges, preference being given to ex-Service men, and that any grant paid should not exceed 60 per cent, (originally 30 per cent.) of the wages bill of additional men taken on for the work. Further, the works had to be such as were approved by the appropriate Department of the Government as suitable works of public utility.In addition to the items outlined above, assistance from the Ministry of Transport has enabled Local Authorities to maintain in employment on road[71&quot;7] B 2
maintenance a number of men beyond those ordinarily employed, on this work. Additional employment has also been provided by expediting &quot;work on sites and sewers for housing schemes. An emergency programme undertaken by the Office of Works, and the introduction of alternative work and a system of short-time working in Government Industrial Establishments have further assisted towards relief of the situation.- In addition, Local Authorities have been encouraged by the Government to put work in hand without receiving definite Government assistance.In all, it is estimated that an expenditure of approximately  25,000,000 has been incurred on schemes of public work undertaken by the Government and the Local Authorities, either separately or acting together,&apos; and that at least 200,000 men have from time to time been provided with work by this means.Summary showing the Labour Employed on above Schemes on October 7, 1921.Scheme.Number Employed J Number Employed in Greater London. &apos;     in Provinces.Total.1.

Where, for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency, Local Authorities (including statutory bodies who do not trade for profit) put in hand or accelerate approved works (other than revenue-producing works), which would not otherwise have been proceeded with, or so accelerated at the present time, the State will give financial assistance on the following basis.&quot;Grants equal to 50 per cent, (later 65 per cent.) of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans raised by Local Authorities to meet expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, will be paid by the State for a period of one-half the term of the loans subject to a maximum of fifteen years. The expenditure to be taken into account will be all approved expenditure incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923.
&quot; In approving schemes, special regard will be had to the direct employment of unemployed persons and to a preference being given to ex-Service men.:&apos; (2.) In the case of revenue-producing works, grants will be paid, in approved cases, equivalent to 50 per cent, of the interest on loans, raised for a period of not less than ten years, in respect of expenditure on&apos; schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, provided that such expenditure is incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923. These interest grants will be paid for a period of five years.&quot; (3.) Schemes shall not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of 10 millions without consultation between the Minister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&quot; (4.) Schemes must be approved by the Ministry of Health or other appro-priate Government Department as schemes which will provide employment and must be certified by the Ministry of Labour for districts where unemployment is severe.&quot;PROGRESS ON  LATER MEASURES.1.

The slight revival in the woollen trade continues, but no very large numbers of workpeople have been re-engaged. There is some indication of an improvement in the lace industry.The improvement recorded in the boot and shoe industry and amongst garment workers continues.There is no general indication of any improvement in the building industry.Below is a table showing the number of persons recorded at the Employment Exchanges as wholly or partially unemployed, the number whose claims are current, and the number who have exhausted benefit up to date, for the United Kingdom and for the London area on the 7th October:
