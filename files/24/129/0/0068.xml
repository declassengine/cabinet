EMIClfAI. ORGANISATIONS REPRESENTING IAPGf;Rf3rd November, 1921.Dear Prime Minister,The Hatiohal Organisations representing Labour have noted frith some misgiving paragraphs in the Press to the effect that the abolition of the Ministry of Transport and the transference cf its powers and duties to other Departments is contemplated.   It is understood, however, that the Government is still considering the question and*has not yet come to a definite decision.   Me desire, there-fore, to submit Labour&apos;s views with regard to the Ministry before the Government is committed to any new policy.Sir Uric Ge&amp;des, when moving the Second Reading of the Ministry of t^ays and Communications Bill, said -&quot;The problem Which we have to face has. I think, brought before usj as we have never seen it before, the importance of transportation to a highly organised State such as ours. Me have realised, perhaps,, in the last year or two that without a^p*ftbead.; system/, a vitalising system, of transporta-tion. tho health and housing of the people^ agricultural development/&apos;- 1 -
development, settlement on the Ian;:, an  tho in;.&quot; ur; trial development of,,the country cannot possibly be ;.chiovc;&apos;.. This, House,. an a whoJLej is opmnittedv to,ifthesc rjejforgB11 (Official Re. ort, 17th Larch, 1919, Col.1757)., and in referring to what he had described as &quot;tho Government*s conception of the scope of the Ministry&quot;, he said:-&quot;Thc Government, in facin; that problem, has come to the conclusion that some measure of Unified control of all systems of transportation isnecessary - that there must be some body who can be asked what the transportation polie,y cf the country is and whose, responsibility it is to have a policy.   There is none to-day, and it is only the State, the Government, that can centrally take that position.   &quot;rith our transportation agencies in the condition in which they are 41 appearz,ralmost &apos; tneyi tab le thajb to, a^ greater, or. less,., extent we. McManus t forego, private,, interest and local &quot;interest in theinterest of the State.   In the p as t.,, private interest made..fMor development, but, to-day.,, I, think &apos; y.ay say that, it ma&apos;-:es itfo^r^colossal, waste.&quot; (Official Report 17th : arch 1919 - Col..1760).The Llinistr&quot; vreis certainly not intended by Parliament to bo merely a temporary institution.   Some of the /-utie-s imposed upon it by the Ministry of Transport Act wore temporary (viz., those connected with controller, transport un--ortakinrs), hut others were continuous.   The powers exercised by various Government Departments in relation to transport were transferred to the Linister for the purpose of &quot;the improvement of the means of and the facilities for locomotion and transporty( sections./
(Sections 1 and 2 of the Ministry of Transport Act), and that they night he concentrated under one head.   The &quot;Ministry of Transport published in 1921 in a document of 117 pages a summary of the powers and duties transferred to it&apos;- from the Home Secretary, the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Health, the Secretary for Scotland, the Board of Agriculture for Scotland-, the Scottish Board of Health, the Commissioners of the Caledonian Canal, the Horsey Commissioners and the Road Board.   They related to railways, canals, waterways, and inland navigations, tramways, light railways, bridges, ferries,&quot; harbours, docks piers, road locomotives, motor cars, hackney carriages, omnibuses, Streets, roads and the j^ort of London.In addition to this, the !Minister is the Member of the Government responsible for the administration of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1919,Moreover; the new Railways Act has placed- upon the Minister the exercise in the public interest of powers which are of great importance, including supervision with a view to securing and promoting the public safety or the interests of the public j or of trade,, or of a particular locality, and with regard to the utilisation to the fullest extent of -the economies which can be secured by standardisation and co-operations,Traders ought to be vitally concerned in the mainten--ance and strengthening of the Ministry, as it is only,through effective Government control that they will be able to obtain the advantages of a well designed railway policy and its ad-justraent to the need--; of the economic situation-    The continue ance of the Ministry is implicit In v,he Railways Act, so many duties being allocated to it, and any alteration such as is suggested would be a breach of the understanding made with all the parties interested when the Act was passed.
Business men and others interested in the economic -&quot;development of this country after the war are much impressed by the manner in which we are lagging b hind the public.enter-prise of European nations at the present time.   In spite of the burden of her.debt and the heavy weight of the reparations,. Germany has proceeded with her schemes of technical education^, the provision of electricity, and the improvement of internal transport.    Even Bavaria, in which-public enterprise of such a character was bitterly opposed in other days, has joined in the effort.   Broadly stated, the aim is to provide a kind of public economic environment in which the ordinary industry and commerce of the country mayproceed.   It adds greatly to the efficiency of both-   In Great Britain the scheme for the provision of electricity has been interrupted,,   7/e are not doing nearly enough in technical education,   And now it is suggested that the Ministry of Transport should be closed down.   The- inevitable result will be that in the long*run the country will be less able to face German and Continental competition, for the simple reason that it will not possess the elementary large scale industrial organisation that those   . other countries have adopted*If it is alleged as a reason for dispensing with the Ministry and as part of the Anti-Waste campaign, that, the Ministry was unnecessarily expensive and that exorbitantly high salaries were paid to its officials, it may be pointed out that most of these officials have since left the Ministry and have been appointed to posts in commercial undertakings or In the service of the Railway Companies In which they are receiving much higher remuneration.
The Select Committee on National Expenditure (ReportNo. 118 - 14th June 1920) considered the Minister&apos;b estimateof tho cost of tho Ministry for 1920-1921 might be reducedto  346,592.       This included the cost of the Rates AdvisoryCommittee vriiich will now disappear and of the Irish Branch.The Minister on the 21st June 1920 submitted a revised estimate(No. 122 - 1920) which was for  355,242,     Such estimates mayfairly become the subject of further review now that the Govern-ment control of the railways has ended, but obviously reasOn-able expenditure for the comprehensive and scientific directionof national transportation can be justified.     Reconstructionworx of this character is necessary and it can only ba properlyconducted by a staff.of experts familiarised , in the problems which fall within, tho purview of the Ministry.If the necessary work of the Ministry is cairiod on thecost.of staffing, etc., will be the same whether it is continuedas a separate department or is merged, in another, except in sofar as the salaries of a Minister and a Parliamentary Un&amp;er-Seoretary mi&amp;ht be saved if a merger with another Department(e.g. the Board of Trade) were effected.     But the subject of transportation is of such vital national importance that thetask to be undertaken in respect of development work and thesolving of transport problems can only bo efficiently discharged by the head of a department who has Ministerial authority and responsibility and can therefore exerciso gifts of initiative and direction to the fullest extent.When the &apos;7ar crisis/of August 1914 came there was for thepurposes of such State intervention in the management of british railways as existed, ..unly the small railways department of theBoard of Trade.      The^ history of the early war-time agreements between the Government, and the companies, as reviewed by theColwyn Committee,,-pi&apos;-o,ves. that the department was quite unequalto...
to the task of securing terms which would have formed an adequate safeguard of the public interest4   &quot;it should be observed that in the early years-of peace-time ecpnomic reconstruction there is in reality a crisis Which, may be hardly less acute, since tiiore must be constant effort to adjust the management &apos;and the&apos; work of the &quot;railway under-takings to the public interest.&apos;      That cannot possibly be done by a small group of people in a large public Department like the Board of Trade which is-necessarily devoted to innumerable other tasks affecting commerce ab large.     To return to the pre-war system would be equal to giving up all large and generous policy in the eolation of the problem of internal transport in Great Britain.]Tor all the foregoing reasons we trust that the Government will see its way to maintain this new department which, if its po;.ers and duties are carried out in the manner originally contemplated, will be of immense service to trade ai:d: industry and to the development of the country&apos;s resources. &quot; *yours faivifully,Ligned.on behalf of the General Council of the Trade Union CongressB.B0WALKER ChairmanC,W.BOTEHiiAB.
