IS DOCUMENT IS. THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVKR^isn&apos;t.Looal Authorities A Financial Provisions) Bill* Memorandum by the Minister of Health,L.Q,55,The Looal Authorities (Financial Provisions) Bill provides that no repayment shall be made out of the Metropo-litan Common Poor Fund in respect of relief granted in excess of such scale or in c o ntra vent Ion of such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations of the Minister of Health.Representatives of both the richer and the poorer Unions are assisting me to draw up a acalo for this purpose. But a question has arisen as to the extent, If any, to rinioh Boards of Guardians should be allowed to ignore disability pensions in estimating the Inoome of an applicant for the purpose of assessing the amount of relief to be given.Under existing statutes Boards of Guardians are precluded from taking Into account, for the purpose   of outdoor relief, Friendly Societies sick pay and benefits under the National Health Insurance Acts except In so far as these exceed 5/* and 7/6 per week respectively.    Under the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act of 1920 unemployment benefit may not be taken into account for the purposes of outdoor relief unless it exceeds 10/- a week, but it is proposed, by Section 6 of the Unemployed Workers Dependants (Temporary Provision) Bill, to suspend the operation of this provision,Tho above mentioned are the only oases in which Guardians are required In granting relief to Ignore any part of the income receivable by the applicant, and in the absence of further legislation it is doubtful whether, aa a matter of strict law, the regulations to be made under the Bill could empower the Guardians to ignore the whole or part of a disability pension.On the other hand, strong pressure will undoubtedly be brought to bear by the Ex-Service Men&apos;a Organisations infavour/
favour-of disregarding disability pensions in estimating the inoome of an applicant for relief0X shall accordingly Le $Lad of the advice of my colleagues on the question, whether,\ and if so, to what extent any conoecaion should he made In that  respect if this can &quot;be done &quot;by administrative action..A i MOM), 26th October, 1921.Lnistry of Health.
