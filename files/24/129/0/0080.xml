SECRET. 3CABINET.I.&apos; 3479^j&amp;^circulate to my colleagues a further telegram that 1 have received from the !4^jS tetfernii\ent of India with reference to the previous telegrams circulated as CP. 3383, CP 3412 and CP. 3423.E. S. M.10th November 1921.Telegram from Viceroy, Rome Department, dated 9th November 1921.Please see reference in last week&apos;s telegram to Mohamedan feeling in Sind.&apos;* We have now received further report from Bombay Government. Tlie Commissioner in Sind states that Mohamedau feeling, in Sind is growing steadily more bitter ; that Turkish and Khilafat questions are ousting non-co-operation on Gandhi lines ; and that, unless they are settled to the satisfaction of the more moderate side of Mussulman opinion, there will, sooner or later, be outbreaks of disorder and serious bloodshed. We entertain no doubt that this is a fair interpretation of the situation. We have repeatedly urged that a settlement satisfactory to moderate Mohamedau opinion in regard to Thrace and Smyrna is absolutely necessary if serious trouble among the Moliamedans is to be averted, and that nothing would do more to break up the present artificial Hindu-Mohamedan Entente, and, generally, to alter for good the whole political position in India. We are aware of and grateful for the efforts which you have made in this direction, but, in view of the rapidly increasing embitterment of Indian Mohamedans we are compelled to urge, with all the emphasis at our command, that the gravity ot the Mohamedan situation, and the imperative need of conciliating Mohamedan opinion by concessions in regard to Thrace and Smyrna, should be represented afresh to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Our position, we would add, has been rendered still more difficult by the universal belief among Mohamedans that England alone bars the way to a satisfactory solution. We have done what we could to counter this impression, and have given wide publicity to the recent questions and answers in Parliament on the subject of Franco-Kemalist negotiations, but we doubt if these statements will carry conviction, more particularly in view of the statements that have just been published regarding light in which Foreign Office view that agreement. Finally, while our direct concern is only with the Indian aspect of the Turkish problem, we venture to express our belief that no other interests involved are, or can be, of as great importance as the appeasement of the 70,000,000 Mohamedans in India, and the consequent relief to a situation which literally is of gravest danger to the whole Indian Empire.* Commissioner in Sind considers that continuance of war between Greece and Angora is main factor in keeping alive Khilafat agitation, and is making task of officials increasingly difficult. He thinks it quite possible before long there may be considerable number of resignations of Mohamedan Government employees in Sind. On other hand events in Malabar have given distinct set-back to sympathy of Hindus with Khilafat agitation.)^4843     1Q0  11.21
