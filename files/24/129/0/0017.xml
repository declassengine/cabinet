I attach a memorandum which Sir iviontague Barlow has prepared as a result of this examination.     It will be seen that except with regard to the proposed draft conventions for a weekly Rest Day, no serious modification of the original instructions is required.Unless my colleagues desire to make any comment, I shall, therefore, assume that the instructions in C.P.3215, subject to the modification suggested in Sir Montague BarloWs Memorandum attaohed, stand approved by the Cabinet.(Intd.)

These texts have been examined by the International Labour Committee,-and, as a result of consultation with the Departments concerned, certain modifications of the original instructions are desirable; but save in regard to the Weekly &amp;est Day, these modifications are not of great importance.As regards the Weekly Rest Day, two Conventions on parallel lines (iinclosures m and K) are proposed, one for industrial enterprises and the other tor commercial establishments, from the replies of other Governments to the Questionnaires issued by the 1,1,0., it apjears not improbable that the neoessary two-thirds majority of votes may be secured in favour of both-Conventions.It seems clear -(I)   That no Convention is possible in the case of shops and commercial establishments in Great Britain, and the British Delegates must oppose altogether the second Convention relating to commercial establishments, (li)   As to industrial undertakings, if the British Delegates confine themselves to supporting the recommendation as originally contemplated (see Home Affairs Commit Lee decision of 17th August, 1921), it is unlikely/that
-    113,- - -that they will secure any fair measure of support. It would be regrettable, however, supposing a -Convention on industrial undertakings is proposed, if Great Britain, which is the pioneer of the weekly Ji.es t Day - la semaine anglaise - should be put in the position of voting against the measure at a Labour Conference.     It Is, therefore, for consideration whether, if only as a matter of tactics, the British Delegates should not at the outset propose a Convention of less ambitious scope, confinea to industrial under-takings and embodying the English practice.     This, if adopted, would involve little, if any, administra-tive supervision.In a separate note (Enclosure &apos; ) I give the headings of such a Convention as the Home Office and the Ministry of Labour think presents no great difficulties from the British point of view and is such as if pressed the British Delegates might agree to.     If it were substantially modified the British Government Delegates would have an opportunity, in the course of debate, of making their position clear and Gould vote against any measure which failed to secure that the conditions imposed upon the State were sufficiently elastic.personally, on the whole, I should prefer that the British Delegates be instructed to press for a Keoommendation, if possible, and to oppose a Convention,     I see many possible difficulties if attempts were made to embody for this country existing customs, which do in xaot secure a weekly Rest Day, in an Act of Parliament,     And there is the danger that if Great Britain proposes a Convention on linos which we could accept and then this is so modified by the conference that we have to vote against it and refuse to ratify it, yet pressure may be Drought/ upon
upon the Government to introduce legislation at flestmln&amp;ter embodying the Convention as proposed by the British Government at Geneva on the ground that the British Government Delegates agreed that legislation up to that point was possible,I, therefore, propose that the British Delegates be instructed -(a) To press for a Keooiumen&amp;atlon as originally proposed and oonfined to industrial undertakings,(b) That if this be rejected, the British Government Delegates should use discretion as to whether they should propose the outlines of a Convention such as indicated in Enclosure R.Except in regard to the proposed dx&quot;aft conventions for the Weekly Rest Day (Snciosures M &amp; N), no serious modification of the original instructions is required, as will be seen from the attached Appendix, and enclosures.0.

It will be necessary to consider in detail others, such as public utility services. o.g. tram?/ays, transport of passen-gers by vehicles plying for public hire, gas. electric light, waterworks, docks.)
N*B*     in order to be acceptable the Convention must not (1)     Impose any liability for enforcement of its pro-visions by the Executivo maohinery of the State.     The Convention would confer rights on workpeople, and en-forcoment must be left to the employers and workers concerned tn the industry.     No question of partial or temporary exemptions all of which would entail Government inspection and interference should be accepted. (2)     Impose any liability on the part of the employer for compensation to his workers in cases where the weekly rest period is not, under the Convention, required to he given.4. It 1b also desirable that a clause should beprovided dealing with exceptional pressure of work. This could perhaps most conveniently be effected by allowing work to be done on the weekly rest day period for not more than a specified number of days in the course of the year.   If the exceptions in the previous clause are adequate there does not appear to be ^need for a provision for contracting out in the Convention.
APPENDIX.SUPrmSHTART IN3TRUCTIQgg, (See Enclosure to O.p.5215) AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS.   Items S, 5, and 4 of the Agenda,Item 2. (Enclosure A)   Raoommendation regarding,Hours.The British Government Delegates may support the Recommendation, subject to modifications allowing of greater elasticity to meet special cases.Item 3. (Enclosure B)   Adaptation to agricultural labouroTthe Washington reolilons concerning:-(a) MEASURES FOR THE P^VElfloFof OR iROVlDIIG AGAINST UNEMPLOWEET.The British Government Delegates should hot adhere to the legal argument that the measures proposed by the International Labour Office are outside the scope of the Washington Decisions.   They should, if opportunity arises, take part in the discussion on these recommendations (Bncl.B) and object to certain of them both on general grounds and on ;&apos; account of their infringement on national policy.(b) PROTECTION OP W0M3N AND CHILDREN.Maternity Recommendation (Enclosure C).   The proposed text is based upon the Washington Convention which H.M. Government have refused to ratify.   The recommendation accordingly cannot be accepted and no modification of the original instructions is therefore necessary,(ii) Employment of Women oniEightiwork (Enclosure D). The principle of this recommendation may be aocepted subject to its being made clear that no obligation is thereby imposed upon Governments to enforce it by inspection.   With a view to avoiding any such obligation the Government Delegates should propose that the recommendations bo redrafted on the/following
following linos;-&quot;It is suggested that Members of the International Labour Organisation shall take steps to encourage associations of employers and employed to make agreements providing that woman wage-earners employed in agricultural undertakings during the night shall enjoy a period of rest compatible with their physical necessities&quot;.(lii) Employment of Children in Agriculture (End, E).Article I of the proposed draft convention is in accord-anoe with British practice and may therefore be accepted&apos; in principle, provided that it is not to come Into operation until Section 8 of the Education Act 1918, is brought into force.Articles Z and 3 will require drafting modifications to secure that the proposed exceptions in favour of technical instruction or vocational training are not abused. .(iv) Employment of children and young persons on Hight-work (EncTT FIT&quot; ;If the proposed Recommendation were redrafted to follow the principle of the amendment to Encl. D. in (ii) above, itshould be supported by the British Government Delegates.Item 4. SPECIAL MEASURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF AGRICULTURAL 7/ORK3RS.Vocational Education (encl . G).   Subject to verbal amendments, the Government Delegates may accept the proposed recommendation. &apos;,(ii) Llying-inconditionsand accommodation generally (Encl.H)* As drafted, the recommendation might Involve a degree of regulation and inspection greatly in excess of that provided by the laws or byelaws of the Eublio Health Authorities of the United Kingdom.   It cannot therefore be acoepted by the Government Delegates.   The latter may, however, support a recommendation that Members should do all in their power to/deal
deal adequately with the evils envisaged in the recommendations.(iii) Rights of Association (encl . I)..    The draft convention&quot;prepared by the 1.1,0. is in accordance with British law andmay therefore be accepted by the Government Delegatos.(iv) Protootion^against accident, sickness, invalidity &quot;ancPoIo. age tlnoXT&quot;jT&quot;. &quot;Draft convention concerning workmen/s compensation -The Government Delegates may support the text prepared by thel.i.0. provided that the benefits to be oonferred arorestricted in their application to the same classes of workers as are comprised in the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts (viz.,all manual workers and othor employed persons whose total&quot;remuneration does not exceed  250 p,a,).    It might be desirable&apos;.that tho benefits should bo available for foreign workers onlyon a basis of reciprocity and it may be anticipated that this qualification will be introduced by representatives of otherGovernments.&apos;Recommendation concerning social insurance laws -This recommendation may only be accepted by the Government Delegates if it is established that it does not apply to unemployment insurance for agricultural workers, .Item 5, Convention concerning disinfection of wool Infected with Anthrax spores TJSnoli,&quot;Z).This draft convention is generally in accordance with british requirements and, subject to some small amendments, may beaccepted.   It is felt that the expenses involved by any meet-ings of the Commission created by Article 2 that may be neoessaryare an incidental charge to which no objection oan be talcumThe proposed text provides for disinfection being carried outin the exporting country, or where this is not possible, in the importing country.   ??rom the British point of view, however,it might have been preferable to require that disinfectionshould, take place always in the exporting country but the/latitude
latitude now proposed to be allowed should make tho convention more acceptable to the importing countries.   The Delegates may therefore accept tho proposal.It would be desirable to secure agreement with the Indian and Dominion Delegatesp and tho British Delegates should take any possible^steps for this purpose.Item 6. Prohibition of the Use of white Lead in painting. (Bnol,L). Tha convention draftod by tho 1.1*0. apart from merits, requires amendment, as the precise scope of the convention is not altogether clear.   Assuming that a convention is adopted on tho basis of prohibition in some oases and regulation in others, the attitude of the Government (as laid clown in the replies to the I.1.0, Questionnaire) precludes the British Delegates from voting either for or against such a Convention, or, in fact, any convention which accepts prohibition or regulation or both.The&apos;instructions already Issued require the delegates to adopt a non-oommittal attitude on the question of prohibition and regulation.    It follows therefore that they will not be entitled to vote for a convention which is based either on prohibition or on regulation or on a combination of both.Item 7. Weekly rost day In industrial and commercial ostabllshmonts. (Sncls. M.N. &amp; 0.).   The oonvontions as drafted by the 1*1.0. cannot be accepted, nor can tho resolution regarding a Saturday half-holiday, which is ultra vires.    In no case should, any convention with respect to commercial undertakings be aoceptod.   Subject to furthar directions by the Cabinet the British Delegates may in certain circumstances agree to a convention applying exclusively to industrial&apos; undertakings, and involving no administrative responsibility for enforcement. The headings of such a convention are. given in Snclosuro 3./item
Item 8. (a) Ago off admission of Young persons to Employment aV&apos; sea as trimmars and stolters (Encl. P.).   The Government Delegates should support this draft convention.(b) pqmpulsory medical examination of children and young persons employed at sea (Sncl.     ),   The Government Delegates should not support the convention as drafted.   As stated in tho original instructions, provided the first convention (End, p) is carried, a convention may be supported restricting medical examination to children under 16 (if pressed, up to 18 years of age) on first entry into the service,   The examination should be confined to entry and should not impose re-examination at periodic intervals;    it should not, moreover, involve a charge upon public funds, and this should be mada clear.
