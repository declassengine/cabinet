It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.During 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.During 1920 it ranged between 0-9 per cent, in April and 6-0 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.Per cent.The figures for 1921 are :-To the end of      - ......      6-9January   ...         --- ;-&apos;                     &apos;..         ...      8-5February              --- &quot;                     &quot;&apos;         ... 10-0March &apos;    ...         --- .              &quot;&apos;                     ... 17-6April       :..          -- -                      &apos;*&apos;         ... 22-2May        ...         --- -      - &quot;&apos;                     ... 231June        ...         --- ... 16-7juiy    ...    --- - -   &quot;*           ... ie-5August     ... &quot;*                     ...         ... 14-8September2.

On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devif^ means for relieving unemployment. .
This Committee has since been in constant session and has up to the 31st October, 1921, held 36 meetings.The problem of unemployment in one form or another has also been before the Cabinet on 51 occasions between the 13th August, 1920, and the 31st October, 1921.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope was introduced on the 23rd December, 1919, reintroduced on the 16th February, 1920, received a Third Reading in the Commons on the 19th July, 1920, passed into law on the 9th August, 1920, and came into operation on the 8th November, 1920.This Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. The weekly rates of benefit, paid out of contributions from employers, employed and the State, were 15s. for men and 12s. for women, after a &quot;waiting period &quot; of three days. In general, the amount of benefit was limited to one week for every six contributions paid, but during the first year eight weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn after four contributions had been paid.An Amending Act of the 23rd December, 1920. granted eight weeks&apos; benefit, up to the 31st March.. 1921, to persons who had paid no contributions but had been employed for a certain minimum period in an insured trade in 1920.A further Amending Act of the 3rd March, 1921, increased the rate of benefit to 20s. for men and 16s. for women. It further provided that during each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July 1922 16 weeks&apos; benefit could be drawn by persons who had been employed in an insured trade in 20 weeks since the end of 1919 and were normally employed in an insured trade genuinely seeking whole-time employment and unable to obtain it.A third Amending Act of the 1st July, 1921,-reduced the rate of benefit to 15s. for men and 12s. for women and increased the &quot; waiting period&quot; to six days. This change was necessitated by exhaustion, of funds owing to the great amount of unemployment and was coupled with a heavy increase in contributions and authority to borrow money from the Treasury to the extent of  20,000,000, as compared with  10,000,000 previously. At the same time power was taken to allow 22 weeks&apos; benefit (instead of 16) in each of the periods March-October 1921 and November 1921-July 1922.Between the 8th November, 1920, and the 22nd October, 1921, the amount paid in. unemployment benefit was  49,220,000, Of this amount the contribution of emploj^ers since the 8th November was  9,153,000, that of employed persons  8,505,000 and that of the State  4,544,000, in addition to  1,530,000 in respect of benefit for ex-regular sailors, - soldiers and airmen. The balance was provided mainly out of the accumulated reserve fund of over 20 millions and advances by the Treasury amounting to  4,365,000.-- The number of persons in receipt of benefit was on the 1st July, 1921, 2,062,012 wholly unemployed and 988,364 on part-time, and on the 21st October, 1921, 1,082,129 wholly unemployed and 267,743 on part-time.(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A sum of  10,400,000 was provided for expenditure on arterial roads, half to be given by way of actual grant and half by way of a loan to Local Authorities. This money is administered by the Ministry of Transport and is expended by Local Authorities under their supervision. The men to be employed are selected by the Local Employment Committee of the Employment Exchange and preference is given to ex-Service men.A further sum of  3,000,000 was allocated to the Unemployment Grants Committee, presided over by Lord St. Davids, for the purpose of assisting Local Authorities to carry out at once works on which a substantial number of unemployed could be engaged. The conditions imposed with regard to the expenditure of this mon^y were that -works could only be approved in areas where there existed serious unemplovment which was not otherwise provided for, that the men employed should be taken from the registers of the Employment Exchanges, preference being given to exrService men, and that any grant paid should not exceed 60 per cent, (originally 30 per cent.) of the wages bill of additional men taken on for the work. Further, the works had to be such as were approved by the appropriate Department of the Government as suitable works of public utility. The condition as to recruitment of labour through the Employment Exchanges has been modified so as to permit Local Authorities to draw all or a portion of the labour from Boards of Guardians. [7229] B 2&apos;
A condition has also been imposed by which Local Authorities carrying out schemes by means of direct labour may not pay to unskilled men wages higher than 75 per cent, of the authorities&apos; rate for unskilled workmen.In addition to the items outlined above, assistance from the Ministry of Transport has enabled Local Authorities to maintain in employment on road maintenance a number of men beyond those ordinarily employed on this work. Additional employment has also been provided by expediting work on sites and sewers for housing schemes. An emergency programme undertaken by the Office of &quot;Works, and the introduction of alternative work and a system of short-time working in Government Industrial Establishments have further assisted towards relief of the situation..In addition, Local Authorities have been encouraged by the Government to put work in hand without receiying definite Government assistance.In all, it is estimated that provision has been made for an expenditure of approximately  25,000,000 on schemes of public work to be undertaken by the Government and the Local Authorities, either separately or acting together, and that at least 200,000 men have from time to time been provided with work by this means.Summary showing the Labour Employed on above Schemes on October 21, 1921.Scheme.

Where, for the purpose of providing employment in the present emergency, Local Authorities (including statutory bodies who do not trade for profit) put in hand or accelerate approved works (other than revenue-producing works), which would not otherwise have been proceeded with, or so accelerated at the present time, the State will give financial assistance on the following basis.
&quot; Grants equal to 50 per cent.* of the interest and sinking fund charges on loans raised by Local Authorities to meet expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, will be paid by the State for a period of one-half the term of the loans subject to a maximum of fifteen years. The expenditure to be taken into account will be all approved expenditure incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923.&quot; In approving schemes, special regard will be had to the direct employment of unemployed persons and to a preference being given to ex-Service men.&quot; (2.) In the case of revenue-producing works, grants will be paid, in approved cases, equivalent to 50 per cent, of the interest on loans, raised for a period of not&apos; less than ten years, in respect of expenditure on schemes actively commenced before the 1st January, 1922, provided that such expenditure is incurred within the period ending the 31st March, 1923. These interest grants will be paid for a period of five years.&quot; (3.) Schemes shall not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of 10 millions without consultation between the Minister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&quot; (4.) Schemes must be approved by the Ministry of Health or other appro-priate Government Department as schemes which will provide employment and must be certified by the Ministry of Labour for districts where unemployment is severe.&quot;PROGRESS ON LATER MEASURES.1.

Briefly, these are as follows: (1.) Amendments to Exports Credits Scheme. (a.) Government guarantee to be increased from 85 per cent, of the cost to 100 per cent, with recourse against the exporter for 57^ per cent.* Since increased to 65 per cent.
(6.) Maximum guarantee for each firm to be fixed by special Advisory Committee.(c.) Extension of scheme to all countries, including the British Empire. id.) Extension of period of credit in certain cases to 1927.(2.) Government Guarantee of Payment of Interest and Principal of Loans raised by Dominions, Colonies, foreign Governments, public authorities, &amp;c, where such loans are to be applied towards the carrying out of any capital undertaking or in. the purchase of articles to be manufactured in the United Kingdom required for the pur poses, of any such undertaking, the British Government&apos;s liability under this scheme not to exceed  25,000,000. It is to be a condition of the guarantee that the application of the loan is calculated to promote employment in the United Kingdom.(3.) A Sum of 5^ Millions for General Unemployment Relief. (Certain proposals made in this connection are given in the Cabinet Committee&apos;s decision of the 16th September recorded above). Subject to Treasury approval, the money will be used in connection with schemes for providing employment on land improvement and. drainage ( 650,000), forestry ( 250,000), light railways, and also by way of loans to Boards of Guardians or Parish Councils in necessitous areas who are unable to meet claims on relief (see (5) below).(4.) &quot; The Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants Fund,&quot; to be established by legislation for a period of six months for the purpose of making grants towards the maintenance of the wives and dependent children of unemployed workers in receipt of unemployment benefit. The grants will be at the weekly rate of 5s. for the wife and Is. &quot;for each child. The necessary money will be obtained by means of further contributions paid by those now contributing to the Unemployment Fund (both employers and workmen) together with a grant from the State.(5.) Government Loans to Guardians, in the case of necessitous areas, to enable Guardians to spread the cost of relief payments over a number of years (see also Cabinet decision of the 19th August above).(6.) Financial Assistance to ex-Service Men to enable them to Emigrate to the Dominions. It is proposed to vote a further  330,000 for this purpose.(7.) Acceleration df Government Contracts. The position with regard to Government contracts is being examined to see whether, in any cases, a reasonable anticipation of requirements can be made with advantage from the point of view of increasing employment.(8.) A further sum ( 2,000.000) will be available from the Road Fund for expenditure by the Ministry of Transport on roads to relieve unemployment. in necessitous areas.IY. SUMMARY OF REPORTS ON SITUATION.There are no general signs of a revival in industry, but there are certain signs of an improved tendency in the fancy leather and similar trades, due probably to the approach of the Christmas season.The coal industry remains very depressed; the number of men wholly unemployed is still increasing. In the iron and steel industry employment is still fluctuating, one or two areas showing slight improvements and others changes for the worse. Shipbuilding and marine engineering shows no improvement other than that consequent on the placing of the Admiralty orders for the four battleships. In general engineering the situation appears to get worse. The improvement recorded in the textile industry (particularly with regard to cotton and woollen trades) is maintained. There is a slight improvement in the building industry owing to sanction being received from the Ministry of Health for progress on housing schemes.
