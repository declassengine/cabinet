VI.report submitted go the ooumoil pi- the i&amp;agub of nations OH OCTOBER Iflth, 1921. OH BEHAXB OF THE PERMANENT , MfflA^Bg COMMISSION BY ITS CHAIRMAN. M. TREOPQLI.Mr. President, Gentlemen,The Permanent Mandates Commission, mentioned, in the last paragraph 22 of the Covenant, and set up &quot;by you In conformity with the Constitution, the terms of which you laia down on December 1st, 1920, has just finished the work of its firBt session.You were kind enough to allow the Chairman to give you a verbal account of its discussions.   I have the honour to express to you my warmest thanks for so doing.   You thus afford me a welcome opportunity of assuring you how much my colleagues and myself appreciate the confidence you have shown by calling upon    -us to collaborate in one of the most interesting, and, we hope, the most fruitful tasks of the League of Nations.   I am also glad of this opportunity for the Permanent Mandates Commission to come into oontaot with the Council by which it was constituted, and which has oalled for its help and aivioe.Tho Minutes of the discussions at our first meeting, which I have the honour to submit to you, give an exact acoount of our decisions and the motives which inspired them.   It is therefore unnecessary for me to explain to you at length the subject of our debates at nine meetings held between October 4th and ?th.   I can therefore confine myself to indicating to you very briefly the prinoi^al results of our work and to submitting to you the reconmiiendations which these results seem to suggest as regards the course we ask you to adept.May   I, in the first place, define briefly the spirit in whiolv-my colleagues on the Commission and myse&amp;f have apororehed our. ua.sk?
The Covenant provides that &quot;the  emanent^ommisslon shall &quot;be constituted to receive and examine the annual Report&quot; which the Mandatory Powers are pledged to send to the Council concern * ing the territories under their charge, ana &quot;to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the Mandates.&quot; Such investigations &amp;aO suoh advice can only be of value if inspired by absolute Independence and impartiality of judgment concerning the data furnished to us.   We know that tho Council intended ue to act In that spirit, since it insisted that the Commission should be composed of experts answerable only to the League of Nations as a body, and further, insisted that that majority of these Members should be nationals of non-Mandatory States.   Allow me, Mr.Presiaent and Gentlemen, to assure you that this is the manner in which we as a Commission unanimously interpret the mission entrusted to ue, a mission of which we hope to prove ourselves worthy.In the second place, the Btuay of the Heportw which will be submitted to us and any proposals they may suggest will be inspired by the sincere desire to facilitate the execution of the task which the Mandatory Powers have agreed to accomplish in the name of the League of Nations, the importance and difficulty of whifch we fully realise.   Whilst supervising the striat observance of the principles of tutelage laid down in Article 22 of the Covenant, in the Interest of the native populations and of all the Members of the League, we shall endeavour to exercise our authority, less as judges from whom critical pronouncements are expected, than as collaborators who are resolved to devote their experience and their energies to a joint endeavour.In the course of our first meeting, we had to devote our attention to threatened-ee prinoipal questions:-
1)    We thought it desirable to conform to the request laid down in paragraph (i) of the Constitution which you gave us, and to draw up our Rules of Procedure.   These Rules are before you and we ask you to approve their provisions.2)    When we gathered at Geneva for our first meeting, we knew that no annual Report could be placed before us as a year has not yet elapsed since the Council confirmed the first Mandates.   On the other hand, we also knew that, in accordance with a recommendation of the First Assembly of the league of Nations, adopted by the Council at its meeting in June 1921, the Mandatory Powers had consented to authorise us to study Reports on the administration of seme of the territories entrusted to their care for administration in accordance with the principle of the Mandates.   The Reports thug communicated to us were the following:-French Oameroons, French Togoland, British Tanganyika, Belgian East Africa, South West Africa, Mesopotamia, Palestine.We have Btudied those Reports, with the exception of the ibast two.   Interesting as the reports on Palestine and Mesopotamia are, we considered that the state of uncertainty still existing concerning everything that affects the Mandates mentioned in paragraph 4 Qf* Article 22 of the Covenant would make such a study of little use at this moment.We hove read most attentively the other Reports oommunicatsd to us.   We read them fully conscious of the restrictions imposed on us by their nature, for it was a question not of annual Reports, but of documents drawn up for the Parliaments of the Mandatory Powers, and communicated
voluntarily for the information of the League.   We will therefore say nothing of them here, exoept to express to the Mandatory Powers sur gratitude for the courtesy they have displayed in allowing us to study them, and our admiration for the magnificent and generous effort at colonial reorganisation and reconstruction which they show *The Commission has also taken note, with profound gratitude of the declarations made on behalf of their Governments by MM Fisher, Reynald and Poullet, at the meeting of the Sixth Assembly Committee on September 20tho   If, during the oourse of the present session, we have not considered it necessary to have recourse to the information which these gentlemen were kind enough to offer, us, we shall no doubt be happy to avail ourselves of it in the future.The Commissionj, feeling that It was authorised by the very friendly attitude which the Mandatory Powers have adopted towards it, and inspired by the suggestions to which the study of the Reports already dealt with gave rise, has also undertaken a third task.(3). In order to facilitate the work of the Mandatory Powers in preparing the annual report for submission to the Council, after the first year of their regular administration, we have considered it advisable to draw up questionnaires for this purpose.   These questionnaires are of two different kinds, corresponding to the Mandates &quot;B&quot; end &quot;C&quot;, mentioned in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 22 of the Covenant.   Both are herewith submitted to you.   We beg to, express the hope that the Council will approve this step end transmit these questionnaires to the Mandatory Powers for whom they are intended; we also hope that the Council will request these Powers to take, them into account as fsr- as possible when drafting their first annual report.   We are fully aware that these questionnaires are open to criticism, and we reserve to ourselves
the right to complete and improve them aooording to experience acquired in studying the reports.In drawing up these questionnaires, we have had in mind the ;,C&quot; Mandates, the terms of which were.definitely laid down by the Council nearly a year ago, and the draft MBW Mandates, which still await confirmation by the Council.   We have, however, refrained from giving any opinion on these drafts themselves, sinoe we were unanimous in considering, as shown by the resolu-tion adopted at our meeting of October 5th, that, subject to instructions to the oontrary from the Council, the competence of the Permanent Mandates Commission is, by the last paragraph of Article 22 of the Covenant, limited to the examination of questions relating to the observance of the Mandates.In order to facilitate the work of the Mandatory Powers, and to throw light on certain doubtful points, we would, however, submit to the Council a certain number of questions ana suggestions based on the study of the reports and draft Mandates which have come before us.   The questions and suggestions are embodied in an annex to this report.I will therefore only mention very briefly the question of the national status of the inhabitants of the mandated territories, which was brought to the notice of the Commission when it examined the report on South West Africa.In view of the importance of this problem, the Commission considers that it deserves a very detailed examination and that it calls for the speediest possible solution.,   The Commission is of opinion that, while authorising the incorporation of a territory under Mandate &quot;B&quot; in the neighbouring possessions of the Mandatory Powers for customs purposes, it is not the Council1s intention to sanction any infringement of the principles of economic equality laid down at the end of paragraph 5 of Article 22 of the Covenant.
