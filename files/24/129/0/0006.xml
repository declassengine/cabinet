Tho Committee held a Meeting at the Foreign Offioe on Wednesday, 12th October, at 3,30 p,m, , and&apos; make the following recommendations which they submit for the eorisid^pa-tion of the Cabinet, and for the approvai of His Majesty, 1*  As the celebration of Armistice Day this year will become a type for the future, it is undesirable that the /Oererapny should be too elaborate,       iWther as Armistice Day Is not a day of National grief, bui rather a commemoration of a great occasion in the National history., It is undoslr-able to lay stress upon the idea of mourning.     There should,to bo .however, be a certain amount of ceremonial display/provided by the presence;of contingents of the three Services.2,   The total number of troops (excluding bands) employed should be about 1,200, but the actual composition in detail will be arranged by the 0,0,0* London District who In any case will include a naval detaohmeht of 100 Blue jackets and 100 Marines, an Air Force Detachment of 100 or 200 men at the discretion of the Air Ministry and such representatives of the Territorial Force and ether Military organisations as the War Offioe\ may decide,,3*   The Admiralty will provide a band of the Royal Marines, the Air Ministry a band of the Air Force, and the G,0.C, London District will provide such Military bands as he requires&quot;, but in any case two bands from the Brigade of Guards,4,   The ex-Servioe Associations should be represented by a contingent not exceeding 200 men and these should be chosen as follows: 150 men by the British Legion representative of all Branches of the Services whloh are incorporated in that body, and 50 by the Admiralty representative of the various naval and mercantile ex*Servioe Associations hot included in the British Legion,5,   The contingents of all Services and of the Ex*.Service men will assemble in the vicinity of Wellington Barracks and march thence via Birdcage Walk to the South End of Whitehall
and thence to the Cenotaph,-where they will form a hollow-square around the- Cenotaph.     The Ex-.Service -contingent will march lr.   rear of the contingents of the throe Services and form the south side of the square.     The contingent of each Service will be accompanied by its own band, but after arrival at the Cenotaph, two massed Bands of the Brigade of Guards only will play and will take their place on the Worth side of the Cenotaph.6.   The Members of the present Government and the High Commissioners of the Self-Governing Dominions and India will be invited to attend.     The Cabinet will be asked to issue from the Home Office at a sufficient interval of time before eleven a.m. for the Prime Minister to lay a wreath on the Cenotaph as representative of the British Government,     The High Commissioners will do the same on behalf of their Governments if they so desire.7.   When Big Ben has sounded the last stroke of eleven a.iru maroons will be fired under the direction 0 the Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police at selected stations throughout the Metropolitan area to mark the beginning of the two minutes&apos; silence.    At the end of this period a further salute of maroons will be fired and will be followed immediately by the singing of a- liyranaccompanied by the mass Bands of the Guards.&apos;&quot;..$*t: r-8.   It is proposed that the hymn should be ttO God Our Help in Ages Past&quot;, and that the Press be asked to invite the Publio to join in the singing.    At the end of the hymn the Reveille will be sounded by the buglers of the Bands in order to indicate the conclusion of the ceremony 0,9. The troops will then march away towards Parliament Square and upon their departure the Chief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police will marshal the crow&amp; in Whitehall
bo e.6 to enable-them to paste the Cenotaph and to deposit wreaths moving In. the direction.from&apos; Whitehall, towards Westminster.10,   The Home Secretary should be asked to Instruct Local  Authorities to suspend, all vehicular&apos; traffic between 11 a,m6 and 11 a2 a0m$   It does not seem necessary to perpetuate the stoppage of all rail and water transport during the same period.11*   His Majest3r should be asked to send a message to the Overseas Dominions requesting them to co-operate in the observation of Armistice Day in. such a manner as It may beat correspond with local conditionse12a   That subject to His Majesty1s wishes, full dress should be worn by such qt the contingents of the Services as are in possession of it029 Whitehall Gardens, S*W* 13th October, 1921r
