its &quot;Back-to-a-periny&quot; campaign.The &quot;&quot;busmen have rejected the terms recommended &quot;by their officials, but further negotiations may avert a strike.
THE UIIEMPL0YJ3DApart from Armistice Day there has been a further   -decrease in the number of unemployed demonstrations although the total of registered unemployed in&quot;London increased by 10,514 during the week ending November 4th,     Several meetings in the Metropolitan area have been held In halls but the organisers generally express disappointment with tho support which they are receiving from their followers:     in the case of West Hara the councillors stipuls/te&amp; when asked for the use of the Town Hall that no person living outside the borough should, take any part in the morement:   the committee of the organised unemployed refused to agree to this condition and have not as yet obtained the use of the hall.On November 11th about 25 of the St. Paneras unemployed led by Mrs. Thrlng, who had threatened to raid the premises of an engineering firm in Kentish-Town, and. Charles Jarvis, assembled outside .&amp; small factory in the mews at the rear of Crogsland Road, H.W.:     they were admitted by employees and held a short meeting protesting against the low wages paid by the firm and against overtime, and announced that- if the . overtime was not stopped they would attend again in larger numbers and demand the stoppage of work.   They afterwards left the premises without creating any disturbances:   Jarvis was formerly employed at the factory but was dismissed for dishonesty. .,t,.-      ... :.One meeting at Shepherd&quot;s Bush last week was attended by only 15 people and the officials were not sloxv to express disgust at the apathy of their followers.Unemployed speakers, during the week, have attempted to pour scorn on the Armistice celebration but their efforts appear to havo had little effect beyond their immediate circle especially as some.of them boast that they did not... .- fight/

IThe secretary of the Number 5 Metropolitan Area Isubmitted the following report to Hannington at the 1International Socialist Club on November l th: I&quot;The position in Wo. 5 area ia as follows:Barking&quot;Unemployed being led by local sky-pilot, who provides bread and cakes, majority of present committee nave been provided with work, apparently to handicap movement. Comrade Viilt3hire, our&apos; organiser, visits frequently and things are slightly improving.&apos;    Chingford &amp; District&quot;Nothing doing-, owing to scattered nature of district, propaganda by other district committees is difficult.Walthamstow&quot;Position fairly good, have secured winter premises for unemployed to meet in, but they are a long way from labour exchange and thus are not used as they should be.   Demonstration has been arranged in Baths for November 20.     J. Stewart, of Communist Party, as one of the speakers, still require another.   Industrial History Class being run, about 40 attends.   Communism is not supported as it should be, consider unemployment are doing too .wellI     Financial affairs are poor owing to expenses incurred in formation of band who by the way hai . turned Communism dovm and go busking on their own. Affiliated to local Trades and Labour Council applied fa ease not yet decided.&quot;&apos;   - Bast Ham- &quot;Doing rather badly, element in organisation opposed to affiliation to L*DeCe opposed to those b.. communists *   Sub-Committee has been set up by Trades and Labour Council to organise unemployed.     Have : secured winter premises.&quot;West HamFair, nave secured premises.&quot;Demonstration to West Ham Board of Guardians arranged, to demand allowance of coal, possibility of success very good.   All districts in this area to take part.&quot;Sub. in this area not coming in very well no doubt owing to late arrival of National Cards but consider improvement will take place.&quot;Such demonstrations as have taken place in the provinceshave been with the exceptions noted under the heading&quot;Armistice Day&quot; of an orderly nature.     The Satesheadunemployed/
unemployed have discarded their moderate   loaders artf. formed a new cbranvnist committee.     The communists in Hall have been somewhat diacredited by the fact that the extremist, Donovan Rossi, who w:&apos;-s active in connection with the local unemployed &quot;committee, charged Id, per night for the use of houses&quot;which had been placed at the disposal of the unemployed by the Corporation:   Rossi kept the money for himself and has now been dismissed by the Communist Party and the Socialist labour Party.My correspondents report that the unemployed situation in Lancashire and Cheshire has become slightly worse during the last few wsreks, although there are signs of revival in the shipping trade at Liverpool:   the position in the cotton trade appears to bo bad and my correspondents report-no signs of improvement.   On November 14th the Liverpool unemployed occupied the greater part of the Y.M.C.A. hall in which Sir James Hope Simpson was lecturing on unemployment.. There was a good deal of heckling at the beginning of the meeting but this subsequently ceased, although the unemployed sang the &quot;Red Flag&quot; at the conclusion.JTom the Midlands It is reported thwt unemployment and distress are increasing:   on November 14th men began to collect at about 2 a.ra. in order to apply for work with the Midland Railway Carriage and Wagon Co., Birmingham, which required about 50 hands:   at 10 a.m., the applicants numbered about 5,000:   the vacancies were created by a strike but appeals to the unemployed not  to &quot;blackleg&quot; were received With scant sympathy.   My correspondents report that there is growing discontent among the unemployed In Coventry, Leicester and Nottingham.There is still opposition to the scale of pay for, relief work and on November 14th, 5Of) men employed by the Birrdngham Corporation to repair tramway lines struck onthis/
this account, but agreed to resume the following day at the rate of full pay for experienced and 75$ for inexperienced workers.On November 14th about 200 unemployed who were waiting outside the Labour Exchange in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, rushed the entrance.     They appeared to be exasperated by their long wait in the rain and my correspondent states that they presented a pitiable spectacle, as they were inadequately clothed.     It is reported that the unemployed in Edinburgh have demanded that they shall have shelter while waiting at the Labour-Exchanges.Last week a specially summoned conference of, comounist groups and leaders was held in Glasgow in connection with the forthcoming national Conference of the Unemployed: representatives frota Vale of, Leven, Greenock, Airdrie,.Falkirk, Glasgow, Bridge ton, Anderston, Go van, Kinnlng Park and. Springburn were addressed by Squair, Robert Stewart being in the chair.     Squair claimed that committees representing 125,000 members were affiliated to the National Administrative Council of Unemployed.   The conference agreed that, organisation should be on the lines of Parliamentary divisions, with sub-divisions into Ward Committees where advisable and that communists should urge Unemployed Committees to -affiliate to the National Administrative Council.THE COMMUILTSTS - H f - -.     &apos;&quot; :-Edgar Whitehead, who has &quot;returned frofli Berlin after a totul in Scandinavia, has admonished the British Communist Party for! -*s - its poor effort &apos;oh behalf of the Russian Pamine 3&apos;uad. 0 1 He has! interviewed Messrs. Yasvoin and Crysin, members&apos;ers*;of the Russian! Trading Delegation, in order to make arrangements for the transport of corn and food stuffs to Russia.     The presentorders/ I
orders are that all transports are to he charged currentfreights hut Yasvoin suggested that Klishko might possibly heable to cancel these freights in the case of famine gifts.Yasvoin urged the necessity for a receiving station for giftsin London but stated that Soviet House was an administrativecentre and had not &quot;staff or space for a rag and bone shop&quot;.(Whitehead subsequently saw Squair, of the InternationalSocialist Club, who agreed that the top room from which thebilliard tables had been removed could be used as a receivingstation.)   Whitehead&apos;s interview with Crysin concerned thepossibilities of the funds of the Berlin committee being spentadvantageously in Great Britain,Competent observers within the Communist Party are somewhatdisappointed with the progress of the movement and one of themwrote recently to a friend abroad:.  - &quot;Meanwhile, things do not &apos;catch on1 here like they should.     The party is too much of a very narrow autocracy. ; Centralism gone mad,     Pankhur3t is balmier than ever pretending to speak for a &quot;fourth international&apos; which has not even the semblance of a national section in this country.&quot;There is much perturbation at Headquarters owing to the threat of a leading Scottish communist to expose &quot;the incompetency and corruption&quot; of the chief officials:   some of his colleagues, including VJ. Gallaeher,   are doing their utmost to prevent the exposure, the burden of which is that &quot;Moscow pays the piper and calls the tune and that the Party Exeowtiye Committee and officials are marionettes who dance to that tune and who are, in consequence, determined not to let the rank and file have anything to do with forming the policy or making any decision that affects the Party work in this country.&quot;A significant admission regarding the financial position of the Communist Party was made by J.V. Leckie, who is acting temporarily as Midlands organiser, at a secret meeting of the Communist branch on November 9th; he said:&quot;You/

-7- -    60Aberdare and Taff and Cynon districts of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.     Starr, who has for many years been a membor of the Aberdare branch of tho Independent Labour Party, recently resigned from that body and threw in his lot with the Communist Party of Great Britain.It is rumoured that the White House, which has for ,7ears been the centre of extremist propaganda, in the Amman valley, is to be offered for sale as the owner, a &quot;millionaire socialist&quot;, Davidson, is short of money.The Stepney Communists are elated because one of their members, Alderman Tobin, has been elected  Mayor for the ensuing year,.At yesterday *s meeting of the Education Committee ofthe London County Council the following proposal, tabled byA.A. Watts and C,G. Ammon, was lost by 31 votes to 2:&quot;That, as it is of the first importance that the youth of Loaaoai should have a sound knowledge of that wonderful, historical occurrence, the Bus si an revolution, and tho period fallowing to the present date, the Education Committee recommend the Council to issue a short.history -of the same, preferably written by Communists, or at least compiled, mainly from Communist sources.&quot;COMMUNIST CAMPAIGN AT PUBLIC MEETINGSThe Communists have extended their campaign of obstruction at pubjic meetings.   On November 10th there was continuous heckling at a meeting addressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and held under the auspices of the Liberal Unionist Association at Premierland, Commercial Bead.On November 13th the Communists created uproar, at a meeting addressed by the Duke of Devonshire and held under the auspices of the; League of Nations Union at the Chiswiok Empire:   among the ringleaders were Minnie Birch, secretary of the Hammersriiith branch of the Communist Party   and formerly a prominent member of the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, Williams, chairman of the Hammersmith branch and the
ex-polieoman Thiel, who In 1919 was the organising secretary the National Union of Police and Prison Officers. He was at time assooiated with the Sailors&apos;, Soldiers1 and Airmen^ Vk and in December, 1919, was making arrangements to hold up ev meeting in London which was not friendly, in the event of th Trade Union Congress not supporting his Union. This1*9 idea was to collect good boxers and wrestlers who would go to any length to oppose any speakers whose views differed from tho the Union.Minnie Birch informed my correspondent on November l&amp;tl that in future the Communists intended to create a disturban &quot;at every meeting connected with the Empire&quot;? they carried their policy at the Kensington Town Hall on the same day whs) Lord Phillimore, Bishop Gore and Mrs, Oliver Strachoy spoke a mooting of the League of Nations Union. John Ruskin, of the interrupters on this occasion is probably identical with a Communist of the same name who is a night porter at the Metropolitan Railway Station Restaurant, Westbourne Perl He takes the chair at Communist meetings at Hyde Park and is conscientious objector who fled to Ireland in 1915 and remained thero till 1919 in order to evade military service.THE RED INTERNATIONAL . QliV-. LABOUR UNIONS    ,Striking evidence of the interest taken by Moscow in tfindustrial situation in Great Britain is found in a documentransmitted, within the last, three weeks, from one of theleaders of the Hod International of Labour Unions in Moscowhis ehief agent in this country.   The following are extractfrom this documents..:. &quot;Close connections and correspondence are absolutj necessary.&quot;1.    According to the news which has reached Mobc the Labour movement in England is now passing through deep crisis.     The-.onslaughts of Capitalism have had teffect
affect, and&apos; slowly, the rank and file la moving to the left and this is a fact of the groat eat importance,&quot;I know that you have spoken at meetings and -ee nforenc.es but until now I regret,to say that I didn&apos;t see you carrying on propaganda in tho Press for the oalling of the English National Conference.;of the minorities we were talking about before your departure.   The revolutionary feeling of the Eagllsh workers has. to be shaped into a definite organisation.   It is necessary to start a weekly m^jaaine devoted to the trade union movement and tho propaganda of the ideas of the Red Labour Union International.   Did you discuss this question?   Don&apos;t you think it is time to.put it into practice, that the ground is sufficiently preparod for this magazine to be issued? I bo lie vs. the creation of, this organ under your guidance absolutely necessary.   Think it over and let me know of your deoision at your earliest convenience./,&quot;2,   Aftor your departure from Moscow, we failed to have any representative of England in our Executive Bureau, whereas it is desirable that a representative of the English workers should, participate in the work of the Executive Bureau attached to the Bed Labour Union International, True, the Executive Bureau was elected according to personal Qualifications, nevertheless big countries had boon taken Into consideration and the.;X*ik of permanent representation for England is of course affecting our work.   It is desirable, therefore, that a comrade be sent to the Executive Bureau as your substitute.-- --&quot;3,-; - What is the attitude of tho adherents of the Red Labour Union. International in-England towards the campaign carried on against.us- by the. trade unionists&apos;.   Did you take . any measures?   Did you write special articles on the question?. Did the organisations affiliated to- us pass any resolutions?   Had you any Joint discussions on the matter -with the Syndicalists?   The French Sjmd-i-ealiats are using all means at their command, in order to impede the creation of a United Front, of the Front we took such pains in establishing, at the 1st Congress of Revolutionary Trade Unions.   I failed to see any articles on the subject in the English Press disposed in our favour.   How is this to be accounted for?   Is it to be -explained-by your lacking of your own paper, or you deemed it better for the moment not to start any polemics against the erroneous views of the trade unionists.;   &quot;4.   A conference of the Central Council is to be heM in Mosoow on January-25th*    Your presence: and that of Comrade ....   is absolutely necessary.   If it is impossible for you to come personally, send your representatives, for extremely. Important items aro on the agenda of the above Conference of the Council..   &quot;5.   Does our. literature reach you?  We Issue &amp; considerable amount of printed matter.   Did you reprint the resolutions of the 1st Congress in England?   V/e get lots of English literature, books, pamphlets but the resolutions, have not yet reached us.   It is evident that you have as yet failed to publish the resolutions adopted by the 1st Congross.. What is. the cause of this delay?   Three months have passed since:.the end of the Congress and the Resolutions;-.might.have been already published.
&quot;6.   Summing up, I should feel much obliged if you would let me know what was the 3tand of the left wing unions on the question of unemployment.&quot;The General Council and the Labour Party took a number of decisions on the question and entered into negotiations with the government, The question of unemployment is taken up by tho Parliament, in short it is the topical order of business, in England. What have tho unions done in this respect. Of what nature ware your discordance with the leaders of tho General Council? What were your slogans and practical motions I presented by you? I read rooently that the Seamen&apos;s organisation headed by Havelock Wilson had broken from the Transport Workers&quot; Federation and that Robert Williams took the initiative in the cieation of a new Seaman&apos;a organisation as a counter-balance to the yellow organisation. Did you aid Bobert Williams in this work, do the seamen s nuclei, affiliated to us, support him?&quot;You would greatly oblige me by supplying informatif on all the abovo questions in which I am -greatly interested.   Awaiting your earliest reply.&quot;The London Committee has laid down certain lines forwork in the Metropolitan areas   the main points outlined inthe policy ares&quot;Urge all members of your Union who are out ofwork to join the Local Unemployed Committee,, where allthe unemployed are organised irrespective of their different grades into a compact virile body.&quot;Make a point of showing how littler it matters whea the worker is hungry, whether ho is a craftsman or a labourer, thoy both have to take the same ohass&amp;e sn&amp; b&amp;th get the same treatment from the Poor Law Guardians.&quot;Adopt as your slogan - 6Work or Maintenance at highest Trade Union ratals *8&quot;Show that under Capitalism this is impossible and then go on to urge the abolition of such an inhuman sytrtera.&quot;Advocate the adoption of shorter hours, so as to spread the available work over the number of workers to do it, whilst retaining the weekly district wage.WAGE RBBUOTIOKS&quot;Hare, immediate action is aeoessary.   Gat your Branch to demand the General Council of Trade Unions to issue a definite ultimatum to the Employers that no further reductions will ba tolerated.&quot;A special Trades Congress should be convened bo that the whole Union Movement can agree on a plan of campaign and action, not only to resist reductions, but to immediately ohallengo the Employers&apos; right to run industry.   If the Unions would only take up the of fen si vt against tha employers they would rally the Movement together again.The/

Thara must bo united resistance at this.Here also, the employed&apos;are sure of the support of theunemployed. , .....&quot;If the Unions fail to act, then we must popularise the idea of getting our members to work tho existing hours . , and then leave the , factory. . ...&quot;Heaeraber,,.this tactic only wants a start and it would immediately oat oh on.   Tho Unions would either have to support it, or onoe again prove their inability to defend the conditions wo haye already got.&quot;The eonnootion between the Rod International of Labour Unions, the Communist party and the Workers1 Committees has, for some time, given riso to uneasiness in revolutionary circles owing to overlapping functions and competition for paid posts. The last nareed body is now attempting to reconstitute itself under the leadership of J.R. Campbell, presidentp George Paet, hon. treasurer and T. Ki&apos;ie, secretary.   Following on the meeting of the joint committees (vide Report No. i% was decidedthat a statement be drawn up by the parties concerned and submitted to a further mooting.      tf.T* Stophy argued in favour of the Red Trade Union International and the Workers&apos; Committees being merged into an industrial department of the party.   H. Webb and A.E. Cook drew up a statement pointing out the importance of the party controlling &quot;all units of the revolutionary movement in this country, stating that there was no further need of theRed/
Bed Trade Union International or the Workers1 Committee movement and supporting the contention that the party shoj merge both organisations. H. Pollitt urt,ed that there wai work for both organisations and suggested that the Commun Party end the Bed Trade Union International should contini operations as oeparato organisations but supportangthe fusic of the Bod Trade Union International and the Workers1 Com Movement and suggested that stops be taken to cui&amp;e the members of both movementsinto the Communist Party: ho als advocated the exchange uf representatives on the two bodie Tho statement by J.B. Campbell covers tha position of the Workers1 Committee Movement and as soon as it was drawn up Tom Mann returned from Russia and the British Bureau of thi Bed Trade Union International met for the purpose of heari his report and of discussing their position in tha light o that report. They decided to carry on as a separate organisation endeavouring to secure affiliation of Trade Ui branches for tho purpose of swinging the Unions over to Moscow. Thoy have not, at present, the necessary finance carry on for any length of time and are relying on oommitt springing into existence m a paying basis somewhat simil to that of the Trades and Labour Councils.Tha Communist Party will consider the whole matter at the next executive meeting and the National Administrative Council of tho Workers&apos; Committee Movement will consider i position as soon as the ballot for officials is complete. Kimo considers that after allowing  35 for tho expenses of this meeting the offioials will have enough money to carry on for about two months.Kime is of opinion, after an Interview with Pollitt. that the financial position of tha British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions is not much better than that of the National Administrative Counoll of Workers&apos;Committees

While outwardly there appears to be a lull in the activities of Sinn Fein in Great Britain, their agents are working underground as actively as ever, and in spite of recent arrests and seizures, arms, ammunition and explosives are undoubtedly being shipped in not inconsiderable quantities to Ireland,    A marine fireman of the name of Kearney was arrested a few days ago in Glasgow with a thousand detonators in his possession.   He wa3 probably only one of many in that particular gang.In Newcastle what has now become known as the &quot;high explosives&quot; case was concluded on the 10th instant, and Richard Joseph Purcell and Francis Barrington were&apos; found guilty and sentenced to three years1 penal servitude each, A*W. Margetts was sentenced to twelve months&apos; imprisonment and his wife was found &quot;not guilty&quot; and discharged.   Both, Pureell and Barrington are prominent members of the Irish Self-Determlnation League and were working closely with Connelly and others, who have been arrested in South Wales, in exporting arms and explosives to Ireland.   There seems little doubt that both Pureell and Barringtoh are actually members of the Irish Republican Army,The annual Convention of the Cuman-na-mBan, held in Dublin on the 22nd and 2Srd October, was attended by some of the most extreme Sinn Fein women in the United Kingdom.Amongst/
