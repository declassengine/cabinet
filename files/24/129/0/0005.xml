[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys G-overmnent] - -GERMANY. [October 13.]CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.&quot;IP ^s-fOS&apos; [Amended Copy.][C 19698/92/18] No. 1.Recommendation of the Council of the League of Nations concerning the Delimitation of the Frontier in Upper Silesia, October 12, 1921. (Received in Foreign Office, October 13.)I. Recommendation. II. Frontier Line. III. Report on the Transitional Measures of an Economic Nature. -IV. Minorities.I. Recommendation.THE question of Upper Silesia was submitted to the Council of the League of . Nations in a letter dated the 12th August and signed by M. Briand on behalf of the Supreme Council of the Principal Allied Powers.The letter announced the decision which had been arrived at by the Supreme Council &quot; in pursuance of article 11. paragraph 2, of the Covenant, to submit to the Council of the League of Nations the difficulties attending the fixing of the frontier between Germany and Poland in Upper Silesia, and to request it to be so good as to inform the Supreme Council of the solution which it recommends as to the delimitation of the frontier which the Principal Allied and Associated Powers should adopt.&quot; -In a note on the history of the question, dated the 24th August, M. Briand added that &quot; . . . . each of the Governments represented on the Supreme Council had, in the course of the discussions, formally undertaken to accept the solution recommended by the Council of the League.&quot;The Council, at its meeting on the 29th August, decided to accept this invita-tion. It has made the weighty problem which was submitted to it the subject of long deliberations and thorough investigation. It has endeavoured to interpret faithfully and in an equitable spirit the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles with regard to Upper Silesia. The Council, &quot;being convinced that its duty was above all to endeavour to find a solution in conformity with the wishes of the inhabitants, as expressed by the plebiscite, while taking into account the geographical and economic situation of the various districts, has been led to the conclusion that it is necessary to divide the industrial region of Upper Silesia. Owing to the geographical distribu-tion of the population and the mixture of the racial elements, any division of this district must inevitably result in leaving relatively large minorities on both sides of the line and in separating important interests.. In these circumstances, the Council considered that it would be desirable to take measures to guarantee, during a provisional period of readjustment, the continuity of the economic life of this region, which, owing to the density of its population, the number of its industrial undertakings, the closely-woven network of its means of communication, possesses the character of a vast agglomeration. It was also of the opinion that it would be desirable to provide for the protection of minorities.Such are the general principles by Avhich the Council was governed. -The Council carefully examined various solutions for giving accurate and faithful expression to the results of the plebiscite.It recognised that solutions based on calculations of the proportion of votes would give results which would constitute an injustice for one side or the other, and-it endeavoured to find a system which, when applied, would assign to each State a number of electors not differing appreciably from the total number of votes given in its favour, and which would, at the-same time, as far as possible, equalise and reduce the minorities.Guided by the above considerations, as well as by the geographical and economic considerations referred to in the Treaty, the Council came to the conclusion that the most equitable solution would be obtained by the frontier line, which is described below in Annex No. I, and the adoption of which it unanimously decided recommend.[7051 n-1]B
The measures which the Council considers necessary in order to ensure the continuity of the economic and social existence of Upper Silesia, and to reduce to a minimum the inconveniences of the period of readjustment are chiefly designed with the following objects : To preserve, for a certain time, for the industries of the territory separated from Germany their former markets, and to ensure the supplies of raw material and manufactured products which are indispensable to these industries; to avoid the economic disturbances which would be caused by the immediate substitution of the Polish mark for the German mark as the sole legal currency in the territory assigned to Poland; to prevent the working of the railways serving Upper Silesia from being affected by the shifting of the political frontier; to regulate the supplies of water and electricity; to maintain freedom of movement for individuals across the new frontier; to guarantee respect for private property; to guarantee, as far as possible, to the workers that they shall not lose, in the portion of territory assigned to Poland, the advantages which were secured to them by German social legislation and by their Trades Union organisation; and, finally, to ensure the protection of minorities on the basis of an equitable reciprocity.The solution of these problems should be achieved by means of arrangements effected under the form of a general convention between Germany and Poland. The Treaty of Versailles has provided, in several tanalogous cases, for conventions of this kind. As regards Upper Silesia, the treaty has regulated certain questions by means of special provisions. Article 92 stipulated, moreover, that &quot; further agree-ments regulate all questions arising out of the cession of the above territory which are not regulated by the present treaty.&apos;&apos;The conclusion between the parties of a general convention which will place Upper Silesia under a special regime during the transitional period, seems to correspond to the intentions already expressed by the States concerned. Both Germany and Poland have indeed already considered the establishment of special institutions for this region.With a view to facilitating the preparation and to supervising the application of the temporary measures, of which a summary has been given above, and which should be incorporated in a general convention, the Council considers that it is necessary to set up a commission composed of an equal number of Germans and Poles from Upper Silesia, and of a President of another nationality, who might be designated by the Council of the League of Nations. This commission might be called the &quot;Upper Silesian Mixed Commission.&quot; It would be essentially an advisory organ.Further, it would also be expedient to constitute an arbitral tribunal to settle any private disputes which might be occasioned by the application of the temporary measures.All disputes in^connection with the carrying out and the interpretation of the general convention should be settled in conformity with the provisions of this convention, and, where necessary, with the Covenant of the League of Nations.A certain time will elapse before the temporary regime referred to above can be definitively adopted and put in force. It will be for the Principal Allied and Associated Powers to take all measures necessitated by this preliminary period.A Frontier Delimitation Commission should mark out the course of the frontier on the spot. It will be the duty of the Inter-Allied Commission already in existence to take the necessary measures for the maintenance of order during this preliminary period.Finally, it is important that the Mixed Commission referred to above should be appointed without delay in order that it may give its assistance to the Inter-Allied Commission, which, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 6 of the annex to article 88 of the Treaty of Versailles, will take measures for preparing the transition from the present situation to the provisional regime.The Council of the League of Nations has the honour to communicate to the Supreme Council a report, which is annexed, containing a statement of the principles which, in the opinion of the Council, would serve as a basis for the general convention between the parties.A second annexed report deals, in the same spirit, with the problems of nationality, domicile, and the protection of minorities, the solution of which constitutes an essential condition for the maintenance of economic life in Upper Silesia.
The Council considers the above proposals with regard to economic conditions -as forming a unity. The Council is convinced that this scheme, taken as a whole, and after certain necessary precisions have been introduced, will safeguard the interests of the population, the sacrifices which it requires from each of the Govern-ments being compensated for by the guarantees which it affords in favour of such of their nationals as are to be transferred to another sovereignty.With regard to the establishment of the organisation referred to, and also with regard to anything else which will facilitate the carrying out of the programme, the Council of the League of Nations remains entirely at the disposal of the Supreme Council.October 12, 1921.II. Description of the Frontier Line between Germany and Poland in upper Silesia.The frontier line would follow the Oder from the point where that river enters Upper Silesia as far as Niebetshau; it would then run towards the north-east, leaving in Polish territory the communes of Hohenborken, Wilhelmsthal, Raschutz, Adamowitz, Bogunitz, Lissek, Suminin, Zwonowitz, Chwallenozitz, Ochojetz, Wilcza (upper and lower), Kriewald, Knurow, Gieraltowitz, Preiswitz, Makoschau, Kunzendorf, Paulsdorf, Ruda, Orzegow, Schlesiengrube, Hohenlinde; and leaving in German territory the communes of Ostrog, Markowitz, Babitz, Gurez, Stodoll, Niederdorf, Vilchowitz, Nieborowitzer, Hammer, Nieborowitz, Schonwald, Allguth, Zabrze, Sosnica, Mathesdorf, Zaborze, Biskupitz, Bobrek, Schomberg; thence it would pass between Rossberg (which falls to Germany) and Birkenhain (which falls to Poland), and would take a north-westerly direction, leaving in German territory the communes of Karf, Miechowitz, Stollarzowitz, Friedrichswille, Ptakowitz, Larischhof, Miedar, Hanusek, Neudorf - Tworog, Kottenlust, Potemba, Keltsh, Zawadski, Pluder-Petershof, Klein-Lagiewnik, Skrzidlowitz, Gwosdzian, Dzielna, Cziasnau, Sorowski, and leaving in Polish territory the communes of Scharley, Radzionkau, Trockenberg, Neu-Repton, Alt-Repton, Alt-Tarnowitz, Rybna, Piassetzna, Boruschowitz, Mikoleska, Drath-hammer, Bruschiek, Wtistenhammer, Kokottek, Koschmieder, Pawonkau, Spiegel-hof (Gutsbezirk\ Gross Lagiewnik, Glinitz, Kochschiitz, Lissau. To the north of the latter place it would coincide with the former frontier of the German Empire as far as the point where the latter frontier joins the frontier already fixed between Germany and Poland.III.
