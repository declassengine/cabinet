[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.^Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1921.SECEET. 3CP.-3462.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OE THE STATE OF IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 31st ultimo.General State of the Country.Observance of Tfuce.There has been no very marked change in the situation, so far as the observance of the truce is concerned, since my last report. Complaints of illegal drillings and of Sinn Fein Court activities are still frequent, but the other breaches, for the most part, would appear to be due to the imperfect control exercised by the Sinn Fein Head-quarters in Dublin over the local units of their organisation. This has been particularly noticeable in such cases as the levying of money for I.R.A. purposes, the commandeering of houses and illegal arrests. Assurances were given quite early in the truce that the imposition of levies upon, persons who were not members of the I.R.A. was not authorised or countenanced by the heads of that organisation, but despite these assurances demand notes purporting to come from local &quot; com-commandants &apos;&apos; continued to be issued in many parts of the country, and it became increasingly evident that large sums were being collected from unwilling subscribers. Representations were recently made that this scandal could not be allowed to continue, and I am glad to state that the responsible heads of Sinn Fein have now caused instructions to be issued which, it is hoped, will have the effect of removing all further ground of complaint. As regards the commandeering of houses and kidnappings, the Sinn Fein liaison authorities in Dublin have responded readily in every case of complaint and appear to be genuinely anxious to co-operate so far as they are able in securing a stricter observance of tne truce conditions. Their inter-vention has been attended in most cases with satisfactory results, but what appears to be most urgently required is a more rigorous control, exercised locally, over the subordinate officers and rank and file of their organisation throughout the country, and the new liaison arrangements to which I referred in my last report are designed to meet this requirement to some extent, by providing for greater decentralisation of responsibility and authority on both sides in dealing with alleged breaches of the truce. The preparations for setting up this new liaison machinery are now practi-cally complete, and the scheme will be brought into operation in the course of a few days.The most serious breach of the truce committed during the past week was the complete destruction by fire on the 28th ultimo of the Royal Irish Constabulary barrack, at Passage East, Co. Waterford, which had been evacuated by the police two days previously. There appears to bei no doubt that the outrage was committed by the local members of the I.R.A., but I am glad to state that the Sinn Fein Head-quarters in Dublin have disclaimed all prior knowledge or responsibility for it, and have issued explicit instructions that no further attacks are to be made on police barracks which may be evacuated during the truce. The evacuation of a number of barracks is being carried out as part of a general plan for concentrating the Police in winter quarters, and the Sinn Fein leaders are agreed that this plan is open to no objection by them under the terms of the truce agreement. Some slight damage (amounting to about  20) was done to another vacated barrack &quot;(Urlingford, Co. Kilkenny) between the time of its evacuation on the 26th ultimo and the 29th ultimo, but it is possible that in this case the outrage was the work of irresponsible individuals.f723JB]
Another outrage committed upon the Police was the holding up and searching of four Constables in Kilbrittain, Co. Cork, on the 25th ultimo.Twelve cases of illegal arrests were reported during the week, including the cases of two Constables, who were arrested while attending a local Sinn Fein meeting. The Constables had no instructions to attend the meeting, and resentmeni at their presence was evidently the motive of their arrest. Both Constables were released uninjured three days later. Six of the other persons, whose arrest was reported during the week, are also known to have been released. cThe assurance recently given by the Sinn Fein leaders, to which reference was made by the Prime Minister in yesterday&apos;s debate in the House, that no importation of arms into Ireland will be attempted by them during the truce, should do much to allay the fears of those who are disposed to regard the truce with distrust and suspicion as providing a dangerous opportunity for the strengthening and re-equip-ment of the I.R.A.Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.Four trials of civilians by Court-Martial were concluded during the week, resulting in three convictions and one acquittal. All the convictions were on the charges of illegal possession of arms and ammunition, and sentences of seven years&apos; penal servitude in one case, and five years&apos; penal servitude in the other two cases were imposed.Internments.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 29th ultimo:- -Total orders made    ... ... ... ... ...      4,368Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       242 .

Unionist and Nationalist papers agree in taking a serious view of the present situation, and the strength of the opposition with which any demands involving renunciation of allegiance to the Crown will be met by the British public is now fully realised. The annual Ard Fheis (convention) of Sinn Pein was held in the Mansion House, Dublin, on the 27th ultimo, and, acting on Mr. de Valera&apos;s advice, conducted its proceedings in private, in order that there might be full freedom of discussion without the risk of anything being published which would hamper the work of the Irish delegates in London. It is, perhaps, significant that the official report of the proceedings, although stating that a resolution was passed expressing &quot; Sinn Pein&apos;s undivided allegiance and entire support to Dail Eireann, the duly-elected Parliament of Ireland,&quot; contains no mention of a Republic.H irish Office, S.W.1, November 1, 1921.
