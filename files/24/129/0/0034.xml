THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.\CABINET UFUTURE OF THE SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT ORGANISATION. Memorandum toy the President of the Board of Trade.So far as concerns the Food Transport Organisation for which I am responsible, I share the opinion of Sir Eric Geddes that the time has come for its disbandment.     The staff has already been reduced to the lowest nucleus compatible with the fulfilment of the duties proscribed by tho Supply and Transport Committee, and I have only acquiesced in its retention in deference to the Cabinet decision of the 3rd March.     The direct control of Food Transport, in case of emergency, was the natural corollary to the direct control of food supplies *     Food supplies have been free for a considerable period and it is time that food transport was freed too.     Moreover, the increase in the number of commercial transport vehicles makes visible the mobile reserve which it has been a main function of transport registration to indicate.My Divisional staffs have already been warned that their employment would probably terminate on the 31st December.     They have asked that they might be allowed to employ the interval in the working out of schemes in consultation with the transport trades which might prove of value in case of serious dislocation of norma? transport.     An there might well arise in the future some need for the guidance of voluntary effort which would render prepared schemes useful, I should like to be authorised to accept their suggestion and to defer the closing down of the Divisional Offices until the end of the year.     They could not in any case be closed before the end of November, and some of them not then.I am of opinion that this change of policy should be publicly announced.     Traders and consumers alike have become so accustomed during the last two years to regard the maintenance of food and other essential services as a normal function of government, that private enterprise can hardly be expected to reassert itself adequately unless the nocessity is made absolutely clear.(Initialled)     S.B.October 21, 1921.
