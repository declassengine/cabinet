[This Document is the Property of 3H^Britannic Majest/s^ Government.], Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.SECRET.CP.-3444.CABINET.WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF  IRELAND.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I SUBMIT for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 24th instant.General State of the Country.Observance of the Truce.Reports of Sinn Fein breaches of the truce continue to be received from the Police in all parts of the country, the majority of the complaints relating to drilling and the holding of illegal courts. As stated in my survey of last week, the most serious menace to the truce is the frequent arrests by the I.R.A. or Sinn Fein police of British subjects who refuse to comply with demands or exactions made upon them by persons claiming authority under the so-called Republican Government. The number of illegal arrests reported during the past week was 18, of which 12 were of persons who are believed to have been arrested for trial by Sinn Fein Courts, -and three of persons believed to have been kidnapped in order to prevent their attend.-ance at the ordinary legal courts. The motive of the arrest in the other three cases has not yet been ascertained. Among the persons arrested was a Mir. Chas. Graham, Justice of the Peace for Co. Sligo, who was kidnapped at Tubbercurry on the 17th instant because he refused to pay a fine of  1,000 imposed upon him by a Sinn Fein Court as a punishment for having recently issued Civil Bill processes for debts due to him from a number of persons in that neighbourhood. A nephew of Mr. Graham&apos;s, who endeavoured to obtain his release by interceding with his captors, was himself detained for one night, and on the following day was brought before a Sinn Fein Court and sentenced to a fine of  5, to be paid within seven days. The case has been taken up with the Sinn Fein Liaison Headquarters in Dublin, who have now issued orders for Mr. Graham&apos;s immediate release. A case of an even more serious character was the kidnapping and subsequent death of Mr. Bernard Mailey, a Civil Bill jOfficer of Raphoe, Co. Donegal. Mr. Mailey, who recently served a number of processes for the Lifford Quarter Sessions, was kidnapped on the evening of the 16th instant, and on the 18th instant a telegram was received by the parish priest from a person styling himself a Brigadier of the I.R.A. to the effect that his body had been found and that an inquest would be held upon it. On the body being returned to the relatives a Military Court of Enquiry was held, but it was then too late to certify the cause of death, and the enquiry has been adjourned until the 25th instant to enable the Police to obtain the attendance of the doctors by whom the post-mortem examination at the illegal inquest was performed. The verdict given at that inquest was that death was due to heart failure, no wounds having been discovered on the body. According to one newspaper report it is rumoured that Mr. Mailey collapsed in a struggle with his captors.Among the many Sinn Fein Court activities reported during the week was the announcement of a Land Settlement Court to be held in Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, on the 25th instant. On the facts as presented in a question put to me in the House of Commons, the case clearly constituted a very gross violation both of the ordinary law and of the terms of the truce, but I am glad to state that on representations being made to the Sinn Fein delegates in London instructions were issued to their officials in Dublin prohibiting the holding of the Court. It is to be hoped that the improved liaison arrangements which are now being set up will result in removing many of the causes of friction which have militated against the successful working of the truce.[7191]
Situation in Belfast.The state of Belfast continues to give cause for anxiety, and the utmost vigi-lance on the part of the Police and Military is required to prevent the constantly occurring individual outbreaks of sectarian and party animosity from developing into general disorder. On the 10th instant a number of shots were exchanged between the rival parties, and one man (a Protestant) was slightly wounded by a bullet which was fired into his house in Grove Street. Three revolver shots were fired about the same time through the window of a house in the same locality occupied by a Catholic, but fortunately without causing any injury. On the evening of the 19th instant a number of attacks were made upon individuals belonging to both parties, and several shoots were fired on both sides, but the prompt intervention of the Military prevented the disturbances from attaining to serious dimensions. A man and a woman (both Protestants) were wounded by rifle or revolver fire, and a Constable was seriously injured in the head by a stone. The only other incident of note during the week was a savage assault made on a Protestant labourer on the 21st instant near the corner of Little Donegall Street and Union Street. The injured man was badly kicked and beaten and had to be removed to the Mater Hospital, where he is now lying in a dangerous condition.  .Trials of Civilians by Court-Martial.The only Court-Martial trial during the week was that of a Constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary, who was acquitted on a charge of theft.Internments.The following statement shows the position as regards internments up to the 22nd instant: Total orders made     ... ... ... ... ...      4,368Orders cancelled for reasons other than release       242 &apos; Releases ordered ... ...    .... ...       496-        738Number of persons now interned ... ... ...      3,630The number of appeals awaiting hearing is 1.State of the Police Forces.

.  Present State op Political Opinion in Ireland.The serious crisis in the peace negotiations precipitated by Mr. de Valera^s telegram to the Pope came as an unexpected shock to the Irish public. Prom the reports which I have received, this last ill-considered action on the part, of the Sinn Fein leader appears to be generally condemned in Ireland no less than in Great Britain, and to be regarded as an unwarrantable invasion of the powers and responsi-bilities of the Irish delegates in London.H irish Office, S.W.1, October 26, 1921.Auxiliary Division.Strength on the 16th October, 1921      ... ... ...      1,393Deaths   ...         ...         ...         ... ... resignations       ...         ...         ... ... 3Dismissals          ...         ...         ... ... 1Discharges         ...         ...         ... ... 3Total wastage ... 8Recruits            ...         ...         ... ...
