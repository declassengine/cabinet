Bourgeois, who had been asked to preside over the proceedings of the Council pending the arrival of 11. Hymans, who is replacing the Chinese Representative during the absence of the latter in Washington, Mr. Fisher explained the feelings of anxiety and apprehension felt in Great Britain owing to the recent acts of the Serbian Government in Albania which had prompted the Prime Minister to request the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to summon this special meeting.After dwelling on the friendly feelings generally felt in Great Britain for Serbia] and paying a tribute to the lofty patriotism and high courage displayed by Serbia through-out the. terrible experiences of the late war, Mr. Fisher jorttceeded to pass in review the numerous acts&apos; of the Serbian Government in Albania, which appeared to have for their object the complete severance of the Northern part of that country from the Government of Tirana by the direct encouragement of the Mirdite tribes to revolution.   Mr. Fisher was able to quote extracts from the Serbian press giving colour to these apprehensions: he further cited passages from recent reports from His Majesty&apos;e Consul at Durazzo as to the devastationwrought /
wrought in Albania by Serbian forces.1 i na 1 ly Mr . Fishe r e y^g r c bod his profound satisfactionat having learnt,  since his arrival in Paris,   that thegovernments -both .pf&apos; Serbia; and Albania had accepted the award of the Conference of Ambassadors, and gaye utterance to the hope that, the recent incidents-might. - now- be- con- . sidered closed, and that the Serbian forces would be immediately withdrawn to the frontiers fixed by the Conference of Ambassadors I --  -After Mr. Fisher&apos;s speech the Serbiah Delegate asked to be allowed to postpone his full reply till the next day.

The, Albanian Delegate expressed his gratitude for the Serbian promise to accept the frontier laid down by the Conference of Ambassadors but.-suggested that a per-manent commission, consisting of one Serbian and one Albanian representative with a third member nominated by the League of lTa,trons, should be appointed to. see that the frontier line was strictly observed...-.  -Mr. Fra.sheri also expressed his wish to reply at&apos;, greater length on the next day.The proceedings then terminated, M.

Ho toil Vonillemont Bwe Boissy-d&apos;Anglas Paris.Mr. Fisher presents his compliments to the Acting Secretary to the Cabinet ana in continuation of his., letter of the 17th inst: with regard to Albania, hogs to say that, a further meeting of the Council took place to-day under the Presidency cf M.Hymens.M. Boskovich, representing the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government, ,.made a speech of considerable length in reply to the, speech delivered by Mr. Fisher yesterday. The burden of M. Boskovich&apos;s remarks were to the&apos; effect that lurya, as. well as other places mentioned in Mr. Fisher&apos;s speech, were on the Serbian side of the line of demarcation, that it was the Albanians and not the Serbians who were responsible for the acts of aggression complained of, and that it was not true that Serbian officers had led the revolution in Mirdita, the tribesof which had given ample proof of their desire to become independent of Albania,   M,Boskovioh concluded by referring to the reply returned by his Government to the/Conference of Ambassadors reporting that they had decided, under protest, to accept the frontiers which would be fixed and to withdraw within the line . laid down, and by saying that his Government desired to live in friendship and harmony with their Albanian neighbours
M. Frasheri, for Albania, followed with an excellent speech in which ha traversed the arguments pat forward by M. Bofekovich with regard to the Una of demarcation.     He asserted that March Djoni had been subsidised by tho Serbian Government, and- had actually been driven out by the MirSites, and that the armaments, used by the Serbian troops in their advance, such as artillery, bombs and aeroplanes, were certainly not manufactured in Mirdita.     He concluded by saying he did not wish to dwell on the past, but that his Government desired to live in good terms with. the. Serbian Government. He further renewed the&apos; request mentioned in his remarks on the 17th inst: for a permanent mixed commission to watch over the observance of the frontier.Mr. Fisher then pointed out that the one and only object of the British Government was the maintenance of peaoe. in Albania, and provided this object could be secured they were quite ready to desist from considering the adoption of any further measures.In view (a) of the fact that the commission which would study the facts and furnish a report on them was about&apos;to arrive in Albania, ( and fb) of tho declara-tion made by M.Boskovich, he was prepared to let the matter rest on receiving assurances (i)    that the Serbian Government was ready to accept the frontiers laid down.by the Conference of Ambassadors and to with-draw their troops within that line,  fii) that the Serbian Government&apos;would, act loyally towards Albania and oultivate good relations with her.Mr. Fisher pointed out with reference to certain   . criticisms levelled by M.Boskovich,against the terms, of
the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram to Sir 3rio Drummond, that His Majesty&apos;s Government were bound in view of the reports which had reached them, which were confirmed hy telegrams published in the Serbian press, to draw the attention of the Council to the question under Article XI of the Covenant, but that,they had no other object but to see the. firm establishment of peace In Albania.Marquess   Tmporiali and M.Bourgeois associated themselves with Mr. Fisher&apos;s remarks and expressed their groat satisfaction with the declaration made by&apos;the Serbian Representative, and with the fact, that both parties had accepted the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors.The proceedings then terminated, and tho Council proceeded to consider the terms of a Resolution om\ody-ing their conclusions, which will be announced at a further public meeting^

Ho first drew attention to the second sentence of paragraph 6 of the Resolution and pointed out that, as the two States had given an assurance that they In-tended to maintain good relations-with each other, the remainder of that sentence appeared to be superfluous, In reply to this observation he was informed that the text of the &quot;Resolution had been most carefully con-sidered and that the. Council did not see their way to modify its terms in the sense desired.M. Boskovich then drew attention to the pretest made by his Government against the action of the Conference of Ambassadors in fixing the frontiers without prior consultation with the Serbian Government.     As to this he was informed that the Council was not in any way competent to deal with the procedure followed by the Conference of Ambassadors.19th November, 1921,
