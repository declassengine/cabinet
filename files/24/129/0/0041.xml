(Copy letter from Mr. balfour to Mr. churchill)..Hotel Beau Blvage., Geneve,  Suisse, September 8th,, 1921-.My a es r wi ns to n CJfaasc chill,The position of the Mandates question in general,end of the A Mandates in particular, is at this momentperplexing and difficult o   Controversy is&apos; threatened from three quarters..1.    There are members of the League, led by      Cecil,who think that we ought to press on the settlement of theIvKmdates before we have had time to oonsider what lines should be adopted with regard to the general principlesSee -     embodied in Mr. Harvey&apos;s communication of August S4th^ F.3S75.on the oo sit ion of the United States..  2.    There seems t o be somo doubt whether Prance and. England in dealing with the A Mandates can count on Italian support: - since (very unfortunately I think) Italy has not been consulted on the suhjeot, as under the Treaty of Versailles she certainly had a right to be. .    I rather gather that your Office is contemplating a method of treating the Mandate lor Mesopotamia in a manner which in itself Is doubtless excellent, though hardly in strict accordance with the letter of the Pact..    I may be mistaken as to the exact course which your Office proposes, but I -understand it to be this:-That the Mandate should be out d own to very narrow limits; that it should be, in the main, applicable only to Kurdistan;    and that our arrangements with Eeiaai shall not form part of it, but shall be embodied in a Treaty between the Government of Irak and that of Croat Britain^I do not
I ao not question the value of the arguments by whioh this oolioy is supported;    but I doubt whether they can be made consistent with the Ooxranant.   The effect of the scheme would surely be to withdraw our relations with Pelsal altogether from the exceptional procedure con-tsmplated by the system of Mandates, and to substitute for it the ordinary r elatiohs subsisting between two Pavers hound together by a Treaty, in whioh no third Pov/er has any right or title to interfere.   I oannot believe&apos; that this would he received with favosvir in any quarter;, and the Frenoh, who as yet know, nothing of the proposed  &apos; arrangement, would probably side with its most..unoompromis-ing critics.After talking to Hurst I incline with some hesitation to the view that the Eaot would adecjaately be carried out if a Mandate were drawn up explicitly embodying our Treaty arrangements with Feisal and the soheme of the organic law. But, of course, this would only be satisfactory to the majority of the -Sound 1 if they were consulted be for e final arrangements were made with Pelsal as, to the character of these provisions. . To negotiate, the Treaty with Pelsal, and then to submit, it as a lfalt aoconpli1 to. the Council^ is a procedure which it would be difficult, or . impossible to defend- - .It is for this reason that I ventured to telegraph to you this morning asking you to hold your hand in any negotiations with Peisal until you bad heard from me.-.  As a Messenger leaves tonight the slight delay involved will, I trust, not prove inconvenient *Yours- etc,,(!*gd.) ARTHUR JAMES B ALP OUR.
(copy lojt torj r omjtfrj. &apos;0Hurohill to Mr. Balfoar) ..mrtsmQ STREET,,80th September, 19 21.Dear Mr. Half our:,Thank you for your letter of September 8th about tho Mandates.I am very sorry that our proposals about the Mesepotamian Mandate should have caused you difficulty.I should explain in tho first place that Major Young&apos;!&apos;S letter of tho S9th August was not the   spontaneous production of &quot;my   office.,&quot;     It was based upon the decisions of a sub-Committee of the Cabinet held on the 19th August at which Lord Curzon, Mr* Montagu and Mr. Fisher were present as well as myself.But in any case I think that some misunderstanding has arisen,Tho &quot;change of policy&quot; so far as there has been cue - is none of our seeking.     It has been brought about by the sapid march of events in Iraq,,   In the course of the delicate negotiations which ended in FeisalTs coronation as King of Iraq, a promise was given kim that his relations with us should be embodied in a Treaty.     That promise we are bound to carry out, and we ought, In my view, to lot tho league of Nations know of our intentions.   But that does not moan shuffling out of tho mandate or altering Its terms out cf recognition;    and I never intended to suggest any such thing,   Vis-s-v:.si tho I-eaguo the mandate will remain the operative document;   we shall still be responsible.&apos;&quot; to &quot;thorn for the clue execution of its provisions, though wo may chops our o&quot;&apos;.&apos;n moans of regularising the position rath Eoisal in the form most palatable to him and his people.
T suggest that you should take tho following1 inc.; -Urge tho Council of tho league to accept tho Final Draft of tho Mg sopotamian&quot;Mandate (August 1921) with tha single exception of the words &quot;for approval&quot; in lino 1 of page; 3.     (After discussing the matter with Jfyisal, Sir P. Cox thinks it quite impossible that the Organic law of Iraq should bo subject to the approval of the league-;     the- pobplo of Iraq would recent it and our whole policy might be-imperilled).     At the same time intimate to tho Council that their delay in dealing with tho question has caused us serious embartaosmentl    that we have been obliged to take into account the strong Arab nationalist feeling whioh has grown up in Iraq and to recognise.tho King who, as a result of that feeling,has ascended the throne at the invitation of an overwhelming majority of the people of the country; and that, while fully determined to give effect to the provis-ions of the Mandates, ^e find it necessary to do so through the medium of a treaty with the local Government rather than by   requiring Faisal formally to accept the Mandate as a Mandate.     Finally you might sa:; that events cannot ho expected to, stand still, in Iraq;   and that, if .tho Mandate is not approved at this session of the Council, we shall nevertheless be obliged to proceed. .wi th tho conclusion of a treaty with Faisal on tho linos proposed.   The tart of the treaty will of course, bo laid bofora the league In duo course;   and in the meanwhile wo should welcome any suggestions that the Council may have to offer as to Its form or substance..
You need not be afraid of negotiations processing before the position at Geneva is cleared up. Sir P.Cox was definitely instructed on the 2nd September not to discuss the treaty with Feisal or with his Ministers until we were in possession of the views of the Council of the League of Nations on the subject.

Yours etc.,

(SGD). WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
