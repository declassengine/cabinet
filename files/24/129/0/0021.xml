MBMDRAKBtJM OBTHE TRADE DEPRESSION.The present situation presents two separate problems, the discovery   of the best means of alleviating the distress caused by unemployment, and the second - and infinitely the more   important   - the discovery of the best means of reviving trade and thus removing the   cause of unemployment.The first problem is best treated separately and   it is sufficient to say here that it is a matter of general agreement that its root lies in discovering the cheapest means of alleviation compatible with humanity and the preservation of the   health and efficiency of the temporarily unemployed worker.The revival of trade depends upon a correct diagnosis of the causes of the depression, the application of suitable remedies where possible, and above all, since there is no universal panacea, the avoidance of &quot;remedies&quot; which will make the disease worse.ONUSES Off THE PRE3EDT POSITION he fnrMamehtal causes of the present trade position are the direct results of the War, consisting of:(a )   The general impoverishment of the world owing to the enormous unproductive expenditure;(b)     The destruction of the world&apos;s standards of valuedue to the inflation of currencies, and manifesting itself through a condition of the exchanges so chaotic as to make international trade, instead of a matter of reasonable foresight and calculation, a game of chance in which the rules and stakes are perpetually altering without the will or know-ledge of the player.(o)     in alteration of the world1 s channels of trade, which may be permanent or temporary, due   :-i. To the partial or complete disappearance of many pre-war markets and sources of supply, crash as Russia and Central Europe.ii. To the development of industries in the countries which previously exported raw material and imported manufactured goods.These causes mean that we most face two periods cf difficulty:-A period during which the exchanges, and such snfb-sidiary causes as the high and constantly varied TariffB-which have been a feature of post war economic policy in many countries, will forma serious hindrance to international trade. During this period trade will also have to adjust iiself to the . now channela infest far as they seem likely to be pemaaaat.
2i   A longer period which will last until by a process of hard tyork and restricted consumption the world has roplaood the (Stock of commodities and instruments of production lost during the far.RESTORATION QP STABILITY.j; With regard tib tho first psirldd, it is-evident that the measures taken must be directed to restoring stable conditions as rapidly as possible.     The first point ovioualy is to reaoh stability in the exchange?.     Here both national and inter-national action will be required.So far as trade - that is to say interchange of goods * is conoerned, it le Important to remember that stability is of far greater importance than the re-establishment of any pre-war ratio with gold or any other standard of value.   Prom thiB point of view deflation can be as potent a source of instability as inflation.It seems, therefore, that we should first carefully recoiisider our own currency policy which, involving as it does a period of continued deflation, must surely perpetuate in-stability for an indefinite period.   There are strong argu-ments in favour of maintaining the volume of our currency at or about its present figure until prioos have reached a more stable level.Our own currency policy cannot be decided without regard to what is being done in other countries;   the experience of the last year has made this abundantly clear.     Moreover, there is little doubt that international action will be required before certain countries can be xnduced to adopt a sound currency policy.The difficulties and sacrifices which some oountries will have to face to secure stability even at a low value for their currency will be oo: great that it is probable that they will not face this difficulties unless and until external pressure is applied.     It would therefore seem useless to seek for uni-versai agreement on;this point, and as time is of the greatest importance, wiser to approach one or more of the other great commercial powers and endeavbur in agreement with them to impose a common currency policy on the rest of the world.The means of,influence which would be at the disposal of two great commercial powers, acting in agreement, would be enormous and would include --among others the inducements provided by the extension or withholding of credits, the manipulation of the existing international debts, in the case of some countries the reparation payments, and finally in the event *f extreme reoaloitranoy, an economic boycott.Tiss ends to be sought by the application of these weapons would obviously be a cessation of inflation by all oountries and a balancing of their budgets, and when these two objeots had been attained, the stabilisation of their currenoies and re-anchoring them to gold,though not necessarily in the same ratio as their pre-war currencies.
Pressure might at the same time be exerted to induce the countries which are constantly varying and raising their tariffs, to lower them, or at least to stabilise their rates until more normal conditions have been reached.The main point, however, is that some effort should be made at once to begin the return to stability; we have wasted three years in hoping that the natural play of eochpmio forcOs or mutual agreement among all nations would produce the desired effect.At the best, however, this improvement oan only be gradual and we must anticipate a period of extraordinary difficulty and considerable distress for several years.THE CYOIBJAL TRADE DEPRESSION.The more immediate cause of these difficulties is a cyclical trade depression of the type with whioh we were familar before the war, abnormal only in its severity, and the result of the natural and anticipated reaction from the post-&apos;war &quot;boom&quot;.The oyclioal deprossion must from its very nature eventually yield to a revival of demand, and there are already signs that this revival may be near at hand in some trades: though the extent to which the industries of this oountry will partake in such a revival must depend7 on how far their selling prices are brought into line with those of their competitors.   It seems worth while to consider whether any steps could be taken to hasten this revival, in view of the serious social oonsequences which will result from prolonged depression.Whether such a step is possible at the moment oan only be decided by those thoroughly conversant with the financial position, but it seems likely that under existing elrcum-stanoes &quot;cheap money&quot; suoh as that, for example, which would be produced in normal times by a lowering of the Bank Rate, would produce even more than the usual stimulus to an expan-sion of trade.It also seoms worth consideration whether the financial assistance which the Government proposes to give to industry might not best be devoted to making it easier for the banks to take this step and to lend sufficient quantities of money at cheaper rates.POSSIBLE MEASURES FOR ALLEVIATING THE DIPEIOULTXBS OP THE NEXT PEW YEARST ^ &apos;It seems a matter for serious consideration whether during the period of abnormal difficulties whioh will be aggravated, at least in the earlier stages, by the cyclical depression, abnormal measures should not be taken to ease the\ burdens of industry and tp assist the country to obtain, as favourable a position as possible in the worldfs markets while the future of international trade is still in the mfcxtingNgot,REDUCTION   OP   TAXATION.The first of such measures is an immediate and substai^-tial. reduction of direot taxation.   Such a reduction would,
immediately ease the position in tho homo market by putting a certain amount of^purchasing power in the hands of the consumers and thus assist the liquidation of the stocks which are at the moment one;of the chief bars to the removal of the cyclical trade depression.    It would at the same time reduce costs of production and consequently prices and assist us in dealing;with the difficulties of the international trade position.     It would also remove the very obvious danger at the present time, that taxation will be/paid out of capital and consequently will permanently impair the future productive capacity of the country.Such a reduction of taxation in the absence of a prompt and drastic reduction of expenditure, might involve further borrowing but there seems no reason to suppose that a funding operation would not be successful provided the terms offered were sufficiently attractive.    Such a funding loan would of course ultimately prove more expensive than raising tho money by taxation, but this expense might well be repaid by a more rapid return of prosperity.The payment of a total revenue sufficient to allow a surplus for the reduction of debt depends ultimately upon an increase;of the national income through the revival and expansion of trade.    There seems to be at least a serious danger that persistence In taxation at the present rates will retard this revival to a time at which wo may find the vjorld&apos;s available markets occupied by others and all&quot;prospects of a sufficient expansion of trade cut off from us.The choice before tho Government appears to be between this risk and the disadvantages of immediate borrowing.     Under present circumstances there Is some ground for believing that these POSSIBLE disadvantages may be less than the CERTAIN dis-advantages of pursuing their present course.     It should further be reflected that a reduction of the national expenditure to a level more compatible with post-war financial and economic con-ditions is still a possibility and that a revival of trade might so rapidly increase the national income as actually within a short time to produce a larger revenue from a lower rate of taxation.In considering the possible consequences of a continuation of taxation at tho present rates, regard should be had to the fact that the fall In the goneral level of prices has greatly Increased the burden and that taxation which could be paid out of income during a period of high prices and booming trade may have to be paid out of capital when trade is depressed, prices failing and the three years1 average for Income Tax covering the years of inflation is still In force.government economy.The object of the above policy would be entirely defeated if unaccompanied by drastic reduction and rigid economy in Govcrn-ment expenditure.BXPORT   CREDIT   SCHEMES.The second abnormal step which might bo taken would be an attempt to develop the markets vhlch have not been soveroly affected by the mr by a carefully adjusted scheme of export credits worked as far as possible through ordinary commercial
and financial channels..   It 18 obvibus that such credits should be extended in the first place to those countries which are potential producers In the near fuWre of goods which oould be exchanged,for aura, but (where come temporary dislocation is pre-venting the purchase of our goods. / In some oases this temporary dislocation is largely, due to tariff barriers and in these cases the grant of oredits should be made contingent upon a satisfactory preliminary settlement of such difficulties.i It ssems obvious that these credit facilities should not-be granted in respect&apos; of countries whose productive power has been seriously impaired by the war and whose financial position is such that repayment of the credits or a real revival of trade cannot be expected within a comparatively short period.     Credits should only be extended to countries in this condition very care-fully and for specific objects calculated to restore their pro-ductive power, and they should not be granted even to this limited extent until the country concerned had taken steps to stabilise its currency and to balance its budget.    Vve are not in an economic position in which we can afford to throw money away on forlorn hopes and even if we were It Is probable that we should do more harm than good to the countries concerned.Such a scheme of export credits might relieve Immediate unemployment by stimulating immediate orders;   assist trade through the difficult period by the development of markets to replace those temporarily or permanently lost to us In Europe, and by this means would also strengthen our position in the eventual competition for a restricted world trade when more normal conditions return.BARTER TRAPS.3. It Is possible that barter trade might be developed to asmall extent to alleviate the position In regard to some of the European countries.     It is doubtful, however, whether this expedient can be of much assistance since the chief difficulty In moat ot these countries is that they have either no goods at sll to export, or that the goods they have are those not required by our market, but by other markets temporarily closed to them which used before the War to take these foods and in their turn to export other goods to us.     Directly barter involves more than a direct and simple transaction between two countries it would involve some form of international clearing house for goods, and it is difficult to imagine any system which oould be set up as rapidly as the normal trade channels could be restored or which could function as easily if it were set up,DEVELOPMENT OP POMIWIOHS AND CROWS COLONIES.It seems further worth serious consideration whether an arrangement could not be made with the Crown Colonies and Dominions to provide loans on suitable terms to enable them to press forward the development of the territories under their control.    In the case of Crown Colonies these would presumably take the form of improvement of transport and other facilities, and the construction of railways, docks etc.     In regard to the Dominions, the expend!-ture would more probably take the form of State aided emigration schemes on a fay larger scale than we have hitherto contemplated.
These schemes would Involve a definite programme over a period of years on a sufficiently large scale to justify the setting up of fairly elaborate administrative machinery for the purpose.     Thus for instance, in a Dominion which mainly required agricultural emigrants, it would probably be necessary not merely to arrange for the development of the territory in which this agricultural population would settle itBelf, but for the training and partial support of the emigrants until they were fit to take up land for themselves.Such schemes would alleviate immediate unemployment through the orders placed for development purposes, and would mitigate future unemployment by increasing the markets for British goods in our Dominions and Colonies and by relieving the pressure of the surplus population, which it seems only too&amp; probable that we now possess.     If we could barely support an industrial population of the present numbers before the &quot;War^ there seems to be no question that we shall not be able to continue to do so after the War in face of growing industrial competition from the new countries which formerly confined themselves almost entirely to the production of raw material.FUTURE COMPETITION.Even supposing that any or all of these remedies are applied and are successful beyond our utmost hopes, this country will still, In common wish the rest of the world, have to face the prolonged period of restricted trade which will be a consequence of the direct loss of wealth during the war, which can only be replaced by gradual saving.     During this period it is obvious that full employment can only be maintained in this country if we obtain a share of the remaining markets considerably larger in proportion than that which we commanded before the war.     It seems probable that circumstances will to some extent assist us in this, since the creditor position of the U.S.A. coupled with the maintenance of a high tariff makes it extraordinarily difficult for them to develop competition as against ourselves in foreign markets.At the same time it is possible that the financial and other difficulties of our European competitors will in the long run so impair their productive power as to render them less formidable competitors for some time to come than the temporary effeot of the exchanges is loading us to consider them at the present time.     In this connection it is inter-esting to note that there are already signs that Germany, the most formidable of these competitors, may already be becoming a leas important factor.     They have obtained substantially fewer foreign orders at recent international fairs, such aa Lelpzic and Utrecht, than they obtained last year, and there are some reports from countries adjacent to Germany that they are falling to deliver goods ordered some months ago and that in some cases additional&amp;fee have been made to prices previously agreed upon.     These Indications are very slight at present, but tend to confirm the belief that the present competitive power of Germany is based very largely on artificial and temporary conditions which must in oourse of time disappear?   these temporary conditions of course being the continued inflation of German currency and the direct and indirect subsidies
ie the ooet of living to which are due in part the lower labour costa in German manufactures.The above considerations leave out of aooount a possible permanent disturbance of the economic relationship between Germany and the reet of the world as the result of the enforcement of reparations, the probably result of whioh upon our industry must receive independent examination.However favourably all or any of these causes may work for us. they can only diminish the problem.    We have got to realise that if we are to sell goods to an impoverished world we must sell them at a price which that world oan afford to pay and that if foreign labour costs are below ours in any trade, either through their workmen accepting lower rates of remuneration than ours or giving hi^ier efficiency for similar remuneration, no artificial measures will enable us to con-tlaue to give employment In that trade.    The lowering of the cost of production Involves of course two factors;   tleo first is the Improvement of management, organisation and plant, and requires time ana above all the expenditure of capital which waj* and present iaxation and the diminution of the world*s capital resourced will render it extraordinarily difficult to supply.The seoond faotOB Is either an increased efficiency of labour in proportion v&amp; its remuneration, or decreased remun-nation without a decrease In efficiency,     The choioe before the country Is to reaoh this result either by agreement, which would be infinitely the quickest and most satisfactory to everyone concerned, or toy the sheer force of circumstances -continued unemployment, continued distress and In the ultimate resort starvation for the workman and bankruptcy for the employer.
