Seoretary of State.The attached letter from the general Officer Command-lng-in-Chief, Masopotamian Expeditionary Eorco, oonfirms infull the misgivings with which the general Staff contemplated the proposals for the reduction of the garrison in mesopotamia and the inauguration of what is known as the &apos;R,A.^Scheme1toin that country, which was submitted/and accepted by the Cabinet.It was evident at the time that tho garrison which would be loft after the drastic reductions had been carried into effect would bo quite unable to?cope with any serious crisis arising either from external aggression or from internal unrest, and it was the opinion of the General Staff that both the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Chief of. the Air Staff underrated tho extent and nature13 DOCUMENT.

tof tho responsibilities which would lie upon&apos; tho troopstThe salient points brought out in the letter are -(a) That the Arab Army may prove to be unreliable in the face of.Turkish.propaganda,(b) . That in any case its efficiency at such an early stage of its existence will not reach any high standard.(c) That the Mosul garrison will;be       all intents:  and purposes;isolated, and that the General Officer Commanding will.be unable to help.it in any way except by the despatch of airoraft.(d) That the strength of the British and. Indian troops . left in the country will bo. Insufficient, to ensurethe safe withdrawal of civilians to the base,(e) &apos;&quot;A further inference is that the garrison might be inadequate even to maintain its position for thetime&apos;necessary to permit of the arrival of rein-forcements *The above considerations justify the unwillingness of the General staff to accept any responsibility for a scheme embodying such defects and dangers, and in particular.-lar to concur in the expenditure of British money on unreliable A3?abs at the expense of Regular British and&apos; Indian troops.     The same&quot;considerations also justify their hesitation in agreeing to the retention of British combatant units as a portion of such a garrison,&apos; with the prospect that those units in&quot;the event of trouble would have either to beat a hasty and ignomini^dsaeretreat to the coast, leaving their &quot;fellow country men and loyal natives behind, or would; bo liable to be surrounded and over-whelmed before the necessary reinforcements could be sent to extricate them.(Signed)     KSUHY VTILSON.iVii.

Ho. 0/2314/22. ^0SBGxvET.General Headquarters, Mosopotanian Expeditionary Force, BAG-HEAD^     .26th September,&apos; 1921.Tho Seorotary of State for ,:?ar,&apos;VJ;.r Office,     London,   S.T,1.Sir,At &quot;the Conference held at Oairo last ilarch b,:; the Secret-a-ry of State for the Colonies, regarding the garrison of Meeopo-taaia, certain dooisions were arrived at which were based to a considerable degree on the future attitude of the Turkish Nation-Nationalists.     It was assumed that, possibly in a iew months, their attitude towards the British would undergo such a change for the better as to place our relations with the::; on a satisfactory footing and eliminate any danger of Turkish, aggression on the northern border of iae jopotariia.Although the TurLs, so  far as I am aware, have neither accepted such advances as Day have been aadej nor themselves have initiated; -anything of that nature whereby a better understanding might be feadhedj the deoisions above referred to h--.ve been put in force.     Such risk a;.-, that procedure involved Day be considered to have been justified and no complications have so far resulted.&apos;&quot;/hen, however, in the spring of 1922, the Arab Army relieves our garrison in tho Mosul vilayet - and should the Turks continue to be hostile to the British, It ams-t be understood, that that Army, at so early a sta(/e of ite existence, and probably for some time to come, will not be in a position to prevent aggression from across the border area even on a moderate scale. as moreover an idea probably prevails in the winds of the Arab Government, that,  if require.:, the assistance of tho British will be forthcoming, I iaust point out that our troops regaining in this oountry after next spring will, both in strength end transport, be inadequate, except as regards air action, to support the local forces against-aggression at such a distance as is Mosul from Baghdad.Further/ .
Farther i* xanst be remembered tltaat should the Turkti make an advance against tho Mosul&apos;, vilayet,, not hocosb&amp;rily with a view to its permanent occupation, or should their propaganda grow more Intense.,  the composition of the Arab Army will have&apos;to be taken into aocount In considering the situation that would arise..   In that army there are officers who have served with the Turks., and there ore others resident in this country who are ex-Turkish Army officers and favour their co-religionists as opposed to the British.     In such an eventuality as foreshadowed, officers in both these categories may be expected &apos;to threw In their lot with whichever side appeared to offer the best prospect Of advantage :to themselves.My reason for bringing to notice this matter is that I may have &quot;the opportunity of confirming what has passed :in-telegrams bearing on this subject between the War Office and myself, namely, that after the Mosul vilayet is vacated by our troops next spring, and in view of BiM&apos;s Government&apos;s decision, conveyed in ,;J.O. &quot;telegram Wo.09692 dated 23rd August, 1921, -that -they do not in the future contemplate undertaking extensive operations in Mesopotamia, I shall not be in a.position to aid the Arab Army in any way except &quot;through &quot;the agency of the Royal Air Porce.I may add that &quot;tho Briti-eh arid Indian troops, as enumerated In War Office telegram Ho,89716 dated 26th August, 1921, remaining in IvIesopOtamia after next spring, will suffice to garri-son Baghdad, Basrah, and - tlasiriyah, and secure the necessary com-munloations to the sea; in other words ensure the safe withdrawal to&apos; the &apos; bafie, in case of need, of &apos;the &apos; troops alone and not the Civil population.I have submitted this letter -to.-H.-3. the High Commissioner who conours.I am, etcfSgd) A.

SEGRET,.4820.8/1921,PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM&quot;&apos;from -the-High - Ccmrriis a loner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies?Dated 24th September..1921c (Received Colonial Office 10,55 .p.-iruf 26th September^ 1921)0 110o52p dated. 24th Septembero.   . ...........   In connection with proposals recently made foraccelerating reduction of British forces in Iraq and the War.Office idea of withdrawing all British battalions I thought it necessary to ascertain in confidence the personal views of advisers and. senior. British Officials in the country as to effect which knowledge of accelerated programme and contingency.of withdrawing white troops was likely to. have either on. British personnel (who are waiting to hear terms.His Majesty&apos;s. Government, are. prepared to offer- them) . ose on various local communities^- ; i  The result, is a ,strong, coneensua of opinion that withdrawal of all white, troops ; is bound, to-, have an unsettling effect on both communities o.. With regard. to. the programme of reduction it appears that. British, personnel in general feel satisfied (?on the whole),that a twelve,battalion scheme will be sufficient to safeguard .their interests and securitya   On the. other hand having been, witnes-ses of, lamentable develop-,ments. during past year, in Persia, and in view of. future.....potentialities of.Turco-Bolshevik menace and of fact that peace with Turkey does, not seem any nearer It can hardly be expected that, they should close their eyes altogether to -remote contingency of British civilian community having to evacuate /and in -this connection, some doubt .haS: been displayed as -to. whether even with twelve baftalIons it would be possible for army to evacuate -civilian British community, . while there Is   a definite belief/that evacuation would not be possible In the case of 8 Battalions scheme and four battalions schemeo
In &quot;lew of the existence of this feeling I discussed -matter with General Officer Commanding-in-Ohief who informs me t at hitherto contingency of having to evacuate civilian British, community had not entered into :military calculations -on which reduction programme was agreed upon, , The dis.-positions are simply d signed to cover safe withdrawal to Basrah of military force Itself..   In any case it is obviously Impracticable for General Officer Commanding to formulate a scheme for evacuating British personnel without being informed whether evacuation would be made compulsory and without some details as to probable numbers to be dealt with    But T gather from him that with twelve battalions he considers prtma facie that he could carry out such evacuation and with eight British possibly but not with four &apos;battalions..    I should say evacuation of civilian personnel was contingency which need hardly be considered&apos;lf out? calculations could be based on probabiliti of internal situation in Iraq as a watertight compartment. But while Turkey remains a hostile neighbour this is not a safe creed.,, and in view of the fact that all our deliberations at Cairo and programme resulting therefrom were based on hypothesis of a friendly Turkey I have thought:it necessary to emphasize above aspect of situation In order &apos; that in air keen dtvsire-to e. ff ect economy and to reduce our force we may not clo.se our eyes to.fact -that our calculations may be gravely&apos;vitiated by external s ituat ion **
