[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET.CP- No. 3447.THE CABINET.FRENCH NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANGORA. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.INFORMATION has been received from secret sources that the French, in their treaty negotiations with the Angora Government, are actually contemplating according&apos; the Turks facilities for the use of the Cilician section of the Baghdad Railway for the transport of Turkish Troops to Kurdistan, thus facilitating any pressure which Mustapha Kemal may put upon us in that area in reprisal for our anti-Turkish policy.It seems scarcely possible to credit this information, which, if true, would unquestionably convict the French Government of what in the most diplomatic application of the phrase could only be deemed &quot; an unfriendly act.&quot; But clearly the French are negotiating, through M. Franklin Bouillon, a treaty designed not merely to safeguard French interests in Turkey, but to secure these interests wherever necessary at the expense of Great Britain. They apparently believe that we have a similar anti-French arrangement with the Greeks. They are, of course, very angry about King Feisal, and would be delighted to see Iraq thrown into such a state of disorder that Feisal and the British policy associated with him would fall together. All this would be very serious indeed for us, and I am of opinion that at the right moment when sufficient information is forthcoming a very serious and firm discussion should be opened with the French Government.I attach a memorandum which has been prepared in the Middle Eastern Department assembling a number of facts bearing upon these points.w. s. c.Colonial Office,October 26, 1921.[7191a]
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]    3 Q 2 &apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1921.SECRET.MEMORANDUM.THE attitude of the French Government regarding the Middle East has so important a bearing upon the task of the Colonial Office in Iraq, Palestine and Transjordania, and this attitude has lately seemed so unsatisfactory^ that it has been thought advisable to prepare a statement on the subject, based on such, information as has reached the Middle East Department, and written from, that Department&apos;s point of view. Such a presentation must inevitably cover ground which is within the province of the Foreign Office, and the latter could doubtless, supplement our information.The, subject is dealt with very fully in a despatch from Sir P. Cox, His-Majesty Is High Commissioner for Iraq, which is printed as an appendix. The despatch is written primarily as an answer to allegations put forward, by. the French Ambassador in London, but it also sums up the case against the French.The hostility of the French has been manifested in the following ways: 1. Attitude of the French Consul in Baghdad.(a.) At the time when the Iraq authorities were experiencing great difficulty in dealing with the Assyrian refugees, the French consul was in secret negotia-tions with : some of them, and: was trying to persuade them that the French Government would provide for them in the French sphere. Had the proposal been made openly to His Maj.esty&apos;s.Government it would have been unobjection-able: perhaps even welcome.; but made secretly, it; was only a cause of great&apos; embarrassment to us. .(b.) The French consul, under. instructions&apos; from his Government, refused to attend the ceremony at \ the accession of. King Feisal: this; in spite of the fact that at; every step in their Sherifian policy His Majesty&apos;s : Government: have taken the French into their, confidence. Our Iraq- policy-is ; difficult enough in any case,: that our Allies should show open hostility to it in Iraq itself. greatly weakens our hands. r(c.) An:entirely unfounded statement was published: in the &quot;Echo de Paris&quot; to the. effect that on his arrival at Baghdad the Emir Feisal declared publicly in the,presence, of journalists his intention to reconquer Syria, and it was discovered that.this statement had emanated; from the French .consul at Baghdad. . The consul withdrew the charge, and;it must be admitted that in- this matter the French have acted correctly. . They have promised to transfer the consul, andhave, issued orders to this effect, and a recent conversation on this subject between M. Briand and His Majesty&apos;.s Ambassador at Paris gives some reason to hope that the. hostility of the French Government towards the Sherifian family and towards British policy in the Middle East may perhaps diminish,- But we still do not know whether the new consul will be instructed to recognise King Feisal or not.&apos;(d.) Other instances of the French consuls actions as agent provocateur are-given! iix Sir P. Cox&apos;s despatch.2. Attitude of the French in: Syria, v(a.) The Syrian Press. Sir P. Cox deals with this point. It must be remembered that in Iraq, under the Arab Government, the only means-other than advice which the authorities have of keeping the press within bounds is to prosecute, the offenders in the (mainly Arab) courts, but in Syria the press is under the strictest French censorship, and, in addition, there is good reason to believe that nearly all&apos; the Syrian newspapers are subsidised by the French. Consequently, the French cannot escape responsibility for the attitude of the press in Syria.(b.) The French authorities in Syria. Sir P. Cox&apos;s despatch deals with several instances where.the French are believed to have paid money for anti-[7191] B
British propaganda in Iraq. A circumstance which supports this (not quoted in the despatch) is that the French recently paid the expenses of repatriating several Iraqis from Syria.Moreover, it is believed that the French wink at the large business of running arms and ammunition from Syria to Iraq. It is well known that the chief gun-runner is Usaimi, an Iraqi of evil reputation who is in French pay. However, the activities of the camel corps recently formed by the French may have some effect on this traffic, and this is being watched before the question of formal representa-tions to the French is taken up.3. Hostility of the Press in France.In view of the close connection between the Quai d&apos;Or say and the French press, the French Government cannot be held guiltless of a share in the responsi-bility for the violent attacks that are constantly made on our Iraq policy and on King Feisal personally. In one case the material for the attack could have come only from French official sources, viz., the translation of a letter stated by the French to have been addressed by Feisal to an insurgent Arab sheikh in Syria, urging him to continued resistance to the French and to co-operation with him in Iraq and with Abdulla in Trans]ordania until the French should be driven out of Syria. The French published this without reference to us, and it was the subject of very violent attacks in the French press. Feisal denies categorically having written the letter, and it is difficult to believe that he would have been so foolish as to engage in such a dangerous intrigue at the very moment when he was starting for Iraq as a candidate for the kingship.4. Anti-British Intrigues with the Turks.This is the most serious article of the indictment against the French.The activities of the Bureau du Levant, a news and intelligence bureau main-tained at Constantinople, by the French and under the control of French officers, have been consistently employed in attacks on British policy in the Near East.Furthermore, it will be remembered that while the Turco-Greek negotiations were going .on in London the French concluded a secret agreement with Bekir -Sami. When the news leaked out the French were asked for an explanation, and they then gave a written undertaking not to conclude any agreement of a general nature with the Turks without the consent of the Allies, and in particular of His Majesty&apos;s Government. When M. Franklin Bouillon went to Angora, M. Briand declared to our Ambassador in Paris that M. Bouillon was a journalist, and that he represented nothing but the &quot; Matin.&quot; The French press now boasts, and M. Briand admits, that M. Bouillon has concluded an agreement with Angora for the release of French prisoners, and it is pretty certain that if the agreement is confined to that point, it is not because M. Bouillon did not try to include other points in it. According to His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Beirut, who had it from what he considered a reliable source, the French were to supply Angora, under -the Bouillon Agreement, with 80,000 rifles, guns, &amp;c. Again, His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner at Constantinople has received &quot;information to the effect that there is a secret military clause attached to the Bouillon Agreement by which the French undertake to leave to the Kemalists, when they evacuate Cilicia, enough military stores, equipment and munitions for two divisions, and to allow the Kemalists to use that part of the Baghdad Railway which lies in the French sphere in the event of hostilities between the Kemalists and Iraq.It may be that the details are incorrect and that they show the French success in the negotiations in too rosy a light, for now that the Turks have beaten back the Greeks they will be more difficult to deal with; but the evidence makes it fairly certain that the French have been negotiating with the Turks in a sense which, to say the least, is completely regardless of our interests.This memorandum deals mainly with the Iraq side of the question, not because our policy in Palestine and Transjordania has not suffered from French hostility, but because the attitude of the Amir Abdullah and his followers (though His Majesty&apos;s Government set him up in Transjordania chiefly in the hope of putting an end to intrigues in the French sphere directed from that region) has given the French some cause for dissatisfaction, and because there are signs that direct negotiations between Sir H. Samuel and General Gouraud may lead to mutual understanding.
APPENDIX.Sir, The Residency, Baghdad, September 12, 1921.WITH reference to Foreign Office despatch No. 173 dated the 23rd July, 1921, and addressed to the Colonial Office, 1 have the honour to submit for your considera-tion the following despatch dealing with the representations of the French Ambassador as to alleged anti-French activities in Iraq.I transmit copies of correspondence with the Council of State, showing the steps that have been taken to suppress criticisms in the local press directed against the French Government. I would add that the editors of the local papers have also been officially informed by the Ministry of Interior that such criticisms are viewed with disfavour by the Government.&apos; In one instance previous to the accession of King Feisal, I suppressed a complete issue of the &quot;Lisan-al-Arab,&quot; because it contained a not inaccurate, but unpalatable article of this nature. The result of these measures has been that anti-French criticism, which eoulcl at no time have been termed violent, has almost entirely disappeared from the local press, with the exception of occasional articles reprinted from foreign newspapers.As regards the allegations of the French Ambassador, I would protest most strongly against the implication contained in the statement that the &quot; Lisan-al-Arab 1&apos; is published with the authority of the Iraq Administration (see paragraph 2 of despatch above quoted). The &quot;Lisan-al-Arab &quot; is on precisely the same footing as the other Arabic newspapers published in this country. The editor has obtained the necessary licence to publish the paper from the Ministry of Interior on compliance with the conditions laid down by law.In this connection, I have the honour to draw your attention to paragraph 2 of Foreign Office letter No. 1697/121/89, dated the 17th February, 1921, and addressed to his Excellency M. le Comte de Saint-Aulaire, and to emphasise the fact that the criticisms of British policy in Iraq, which continue to appear in the Syrian press and which the. French authorities have apparently been unable to suppress, are of a much more violent nature than any criticism of French policy that has appeared in the Iraq press. That anti-British propaganda is still published in Syria, is evidenced by the article published in the &quot;Muqtabas,&quot; of the 24th August, of which His Britannic Majesty&apos;s consul, Damascus, forwarded a translation in&apos; his despatch No. 128 P, dated the 27th August.A monthly review named &quot; L&apos;Action Assyro-Chaldeenne,&quot; which is published in French at Beyrout, has also been conspicuous for its violent attacks on British policy in Iraq. The publication in the January number of a definite statement that 200 shaikhs had been hanged by the British in the bazaars of Baghdad, caused Sir E. Bonham Carter--I was then at Cairo-to address the Assyro-Chaldean Patriarch in Baghdad on the subject. The latter accordingly wrote to the editors of the &quot;Review&quot; protesting against these misrepresentations. The March-June number, just received, contains an editorial apology for the publication of the story above quoted, which, it was stated, had been communicated to the editor from Aleppo.I have already had occasion to draw your attention to the recent conduct of the French consul in Baghdad and to the transmission by him of an entirely fictitious account of a statement said to have been made by the Amir Faisal and in the presence of British political officers with regard to his alleged designs on Syria (vide my telegram No. 447, dated the 8th August). In this connection, the French consul, in conversation with my secretary, while denying having been the author of the report in question, admitted that news of Iraqian hostility was invariably well received at Paris. It has also been reported to me within the last few days that the French consul has been visiting certain Arab officials, with whom he was on friendly terms before the arrival of the Amir Faisal, and attempting to draw them on the subject of Arab aspirations. His attitude hitherto can only be interpreted as that of an agent provocateur, and it will not surprise me if some unguarded statement made during one of these soi-disant friendly conversations is used as a pretext for further allegations by the French authorities. How far the French consul is acting under instructions I am, of course, unaware, but it is a justifiable inference that, so far from attempting to check anti-British propaganda in their spheres of influence, the French authorities are deliberately seeking occasion to foment such propaganda.I am satisfied, however, that the influence of Syrian newspapers in Iraq is not so great that anti-British propaganda of the kind referred to above need cause much anxiety.   I feel bound, however, to draw vour attention to an accumulating[7191] B 2
mass of evidence that the French are adopting an attitude with regard to the Turks, which is fraught with greater danger to this country and which merits the most careful attention.I would refer you, in the first instance, to a despatch from His Britannic Majesty&apos;s consul, Damascus No. 108 P, dated the 5th August, 1921, in which he quotes an article from &quot; Fatah-al-Arab,&quot; openly accusing the British of. assisting the Greeks against the Turks in Anatolia. The despatch goes on to say that the local papers in general show pro-Kemalist leanings, with the one curious exception of the &quot; Alif Ba.&quot; Reference to Damascus despatch No. 5TP, dated the 18th April, 1921, p. 3, reveals the fact that all the papers of Damascus, with the exception of the &quot;Alif Ba &quot; and one other, not specified, were reported to be in receipt of subsidies.   Taken in conjunction with what follows, this point is significant.Secondly, I refer to a report in Damascus despatch No. 31 P, dated the 21st March, 1921, to the effect that a certain Namuk Bey, a relation of Said Pasha, had been supplied by the French with 1,000Z. for the purpose of carrying on pro-French -propaganda at Mosul.Thirdly, I have to report that a certain. Ahmed Fakri has arrived at Baghdad within the last few days from Raqqah with the following information: He states he was in Turkish service on the Euphrates during the war; at the Armistice he joined the Arab army in Syria, and on the French occupation of Syria he went to Hachim-ibn-Muhaid at Raqqah. In the course of conversation Ahmed Fakri remarked that it was common knowledge at Raqqah that the French had given money to Shaikh Ahmed-al-Sanusi for the purpose of stirring up trouble in Iraq. Shortly before he left Raqqah, Ajaima Pasha visited Hachim&apos;s tents and confirmed the above report; the sum mentioned was 20,000Z., which had been sent to Shaikh Ahmed by Captain Duboin, commanding the French garrison at Dair.Ahmed Fakri added that the French have a secret agreement wit.h Nihad Pasha, who has ordered the cessation of anti-French hostilities, and it is for this reason that the attacks of Chatta bands north of Aleppo have ceased. He also stated that although the French have declared that they are urging the Milli to attack Nisibin, nothing is, in fact, further from their intentions, and of this fact Nihad Pasha is well aware.These particles of evidence, though no doubt of small moment when con-si dered separately, constitute collectively a formidable case, the strength of which is still further increased by the fact that the recent developments of the situation in Syria, as revealed in French reports, are in complete harmony with the evidence thus accumulated. French reports for the month of June last indicated that the situation in Northern Syria was clearing. In August it was reported that Ibrahim Hanano&apos;s band, which had previously carried on hostilities against the French with Turkish assistance, had been dispersed, and that Ibrahim Hanano has himself taken refuge in Transjordania.It is apparent, therefore, that the Turks have ceased to assist these leaders against the French. These facts, taken in conjunction with the visit of M. Franklin Bouillon to Angora last June, presuppose some kind of secret agreement between the French and the Turks.Finally, there is the fact that the advertised attack of the Milli on Nisibii? under French auspices has not as yet materialised. Simultaneously with the cessation of Turkish activities on the west, we have had the revival of attacks in the Rowanduz area and a general accentuation of Turkish propaganda, the latter strangely contemporaneous with the reported subsidy to Shaikh Ahmed-al-Sanusi.in view of the evidence and of the corroborative facts cited above, I am driver to the conclusion that the French are deliberately attempting to divert Turkish hostility away from Syria and towards Iraq. Were we to adopt a similar policy and to divert hostile attention from Iraq towards Syria, the result would be disastrous for the French.It is because I have been using my best endeavours to suppress anti-French agitation in this country, and because. I see little sign of similar endeavours on the part of the French to suppress anti-British agitation in Syria, that I have thought fit to reply at such length to the allegations of the French Ambassador.I have, &amp;c.

Copy of a Confidential Memorandum 2Vo.&apos;627/13/S, dated August 5, 1921,, from the Secretary to the Council of State, Baghdad, to Secretary to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad.I am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. SD/1845 dated the 4th/5th August, 1921, and to state that, in anticipation of the concurrence of the Council .of State, his Highness the president has directed the Minister of the Interior to take immediate action in accordance with the provisions of your letter under reference.Extract from the Minutes of  the Meeting  of the Council of Ministers, dated August 8, 1921, forwarded under cover of their No. 647/10, dated August 9,1921.1. Letter No. SD/1845 dated the 4th/5th August, 1921, from the Secretary to his Excellency the High Commissioner dealing with the tendency of the local Arabic newspapers to publish criticisms against French policy in Syria regarding which tendency it is suggested by his Excellency the High Commissioner that instructions be issued to the Ministry of the Interior to put an end to publications by local newspapers calculated to create international problems the Council unanimously approved of the above suggestion and decided to forward the letter in question to the Ministry of the Interior to act according to its contents.* * * * * .   *Extract from a Letter dated August 13-17, 1921, No. S&apos;Z)/1988, from the Secretary to His Excellency the High Commissioner to the Secretary to the Council of State, Baghdad.I am directed by his Excellency the High Commissioner to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 9th August, No. 647/10, forwarding statement of the resolutions of the Council of Ministers passed at their meeting held on Monday, the 8th August.2. Paragraph 1 has been noted by his Excellency.copy of a Confidential Memorandum No. S29/1845, dated August 4, 1921, from the Secretary to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia to the Secretary of Council of State, Baghdad.The High Commissioner has observed a tendency in the local Arab press to publish disparaging criticisms on the policy of the French Government in Syria. His Excellency is persuaded that the Council will be in accord with his opinion that such comments are neither suitable nor expedient. Neither the British nor the Arab Governments regard with indifference expressions of hostility to a Power allied to Great Britain, while the Arab Government has the weightiest reasons for wishing to avoid any possibility of international complications at a time when all its energies are directed towards the establishment of the independent Arab State of Iraq on firm and peaceful foundations and in friendly relations with its neighbours.The High Commissioner therefore trusts the Council will see fit to instruct the Ministry of the Interior that such vigilance should be exercised as will ensure that the utterances of the Arab press on subjects connected with the relations, of the French Government with the Arabs of Syria or elsewhere pay due regard to the position above explained.
