MESOPOTAMIA.--........ ......His Majesty&apos;a Government wished to take advantage of thi*s special session of the Loague to acquaint the Council with the progress of the policy which, as tho mandatory of the League, they are pursuing in respect of Iraq, and with that end in view they gave due notice to the President of the Council that their representative would make a statement on the subject at the present session.     This statement ent I will now, with th9 permission of the Council, proceed to read.The Council have been kept informed of the manner in which His Majesty&apos;a Government have hitherto discharged their obligations towards the Lcaguoy-by means, of&quot;,the printed documents already communicated to the League, viz:- (1) The Draft Mandate.(2.) The Review of the Civil Administration in Mesopotamia (published in December 1920.)In addition, copies of a Note on PoliticalDevelopments in Mesopotamia since October 1920are b. ing communicated to the members of theCouncil.The last of these documents describes the events which culminated in the selection of the Emir Peisal as King of Iraq and. his formal accession on August 23rd.   The attitude of the people of Iraq during the last two and- a half . months has but served to confirm the results of the plebiscite which, as the printed
report shows, resulted in an overwhelming rote in favourof the Emir Feisal-.It is        olear then that His Majesty1 s Governmenthave not delayed to act upon Article 84 of the Treaty of sevres &quot;by which the High Contracting Parties agreed thatIraq should, in accordance with, the 4th paragraph ofArticle 22, (part I) of the Covenant cf tho League ofNations, be provisionally recognised as an independent state, subject to the rendering of administrative advice , the &apos;and assistance by/mandatory, until it is able to stana alone.     His Majesty&quot;s Government have obligations, however, not only towards Iraq, but also vis-a-vis the League of Nations, for apart from the necessity to submit the draft mandate to the. League (Article 96 of the Treaty of Sevres), Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations lays flown that the degree of authority, control or administration to be exercised by the mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon, by the members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Counoil.His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly think it desirable to inform the League that the political develop-ments in Iraq have led them to the conclusion that their obligations vis-a-vis the League can be most effectively discharged if the principles on which they rest are embodied in a Treaty to be concluded between His Majesty*s Government and the King of Iraq.   They found themselves unable to resist the overwhelming desire of the people of Iraq for the formation of a National Government under an Arab ruler.     The march of events was so rapid that it did not admit of their consulting the Council before taking steps of which they were confident that that body should
approve, namely the recognition of the sovereign whose recent accession to the throne followed upon the universal: demand of the people of the country.     The recognition of a local sovereign modified to such extent the position of the Mandatory Power;   and it is to meet the needs of the situation as thus modified that H.M. Government find It necessary to define their relations with the local authority in&apos; the manner proposed.&apos;  The spirit in which Zing Feisal envisages his responsibilities&apos; is shown clearly in the following passage, which is.taken from his Accession speech:-&apos;:-&apos;--. &apos; &quot;My first task will be to proceed with the&quot;elections and the convocation of the constituent . &quot;assembly.   The nations should understand that it is this &quot;Congress that will,in consultation with me draw up the &quot;oonatitntiori of its independence on the basis of : &quot;democratic Government and define the fundamental &apos; &quot;principles-of political and&apos;social life.   Finally &quot;it will confirm the treaty-which I shall lay before &quot;it regarding the relations&apos;which     are to exist &quot;between our Government and the Great British Government. &quot;Furthermore the Congress- will establish the freedom of &quot;religion and. worship  0 that all- men may follow&apos;their &quot;own law and religion provided it does not conflict &quot;with security and-public morals.   It will also enact &quot;certain judicial laws which will safeguard the interest &quot;of foreigners arid ensure them against any interference &quot;&quot;with their religion, race -or   language, and will &quot;guarantee equity of commercial dealing with the foreign &quot;countries.&quot; &apos; -&apos;:&apos;&apos;Another passage in this speech contains an under-taking that the Organic law which the King proposes to frame and which will be draf.ted In consultation with the
High Commissioner^ shall establish freedom of religion and worship, assure equity of ccramoroial    dealing with foreign countries, and also set up a Judicial system which will safeguard the interests of. foreigners and ensure them against any lntarfdronoo with their religion, race or language-. &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;... &quot;   These statements made publicly.by King Feisal from the Throne at the moment of.&apos;bis Accession, show clearly that he- is. ready and willing to include&apos; in his treaty with His Majesty&apos;a Government, all proper i^rovisions to ensure that the Government of Iraq shall bo carried on in strict conformity with the spirit of the Covenant of the league. ,It is therefore the opinion of His MajestyTs Government that / provided, that the Treaty secures, firstly the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government over the foreign relations of Iraq;   secondly, due fulfilment of the international obligations incurred by His Majesty&apos;s Government by treaty, mandate or agreement;   thirdly, such measure,  of financial control as may be necessary; and, fourthly, provided that It contravenes in no respect either-the spirit or the letter of the Covenant of the league- of Nations, it would provide a more satisfactory definition of the relations, between the   mandatory power and the mandate d state than any other form of instrument,It will be understood that the proposed Treaty will serve merely to regulate the relations between His1 Majesty&apos;s Government, as mandatory power, and the Arab . Government of Iraq.   It is not intended as a substitute for tho mandate which will remain the operative document defining the obligations undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government on behalf of the League of Nations.
