$ IXJCTuira^^ EIS..BRITANNIC majesty^&quot;&quot; GOVERNlflSfiy.C R B Ti.... Referred to ^Committee of Home AffairsCABINS T. DISABILITY PENSIONS AND OUTDOOR RELIEF,Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury,The proposal to take statutory powers to enable Boards of Guardians to die-regard a fixed part of the dishbility pension appears to me open to grave objection.      The right course in my opinion is that indicated on P. 6. of the Minutes of the Committee of Home Affairs for 27.10.210, i.e. that the Board of Guardians should take into consideration that a part of the disability pension may not be available for maintenance in the ordinary sense, because the disabled man may have extraordinary expenses for extra nourishment, or other special needs.     As regards this, the Board of Guardians should consider each case on its merits.     I imagine that they have power to do so.     If a part of the disability pension is not available for ordinary maintenance, then it doeB not eome into the account.(Signed)   HILTON YOUNG.Treasury, S.W.,21st November, 1921,
