Referred to 4^jfA^Committee of Home Affairs gTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&apos;S.GOVERMMENT.Secret Cabinet. L.G.56.u,-P,348VcDisability Pensions and Outdoor Relief.memorandum by the Minister of Health.I submitted a memorandum on this question to the Home Affairs Committee, CSP*3443 and on October,27th the Kerne Affairs Committee, according to the printed minutes, cams to the following conclusions;- . i-(1) That no special provisions should be Inserted in the Local Authorities (Financial. Provisions) Bill to empower Boards of Guardians to ignore disability pensions in estimating the income of an applicantB(2) That the Minister of Health should be authorised In the event of the matter being raised in the debate to agree to an amendment to empower Guardians to ignore a part of the disability pension In estimating the income of an applicant. The matter was hardly mentioned in the course of the debate on the Bill and no amendment was movedc  * I am now faced with the necessity of issuing Regulations under the Act, and, at the same time, I am receiving strong representations from the British Legion and other bodies with regard to the action of Guardians in various parts of the Country upon this question.Disability pensions have been regarded as a solatium for injury received by the soldier in the defence of his country.     They are hot by statute accountable for Income Tax, nor are employers supposed to take them into consideration
in the payment of wages.     The question of how they ought to be dealt with for the purpose of poor law relief is therefore very difficult.     After carefully considering it my feeling is, and I think it will be shared by members of the Home Affairs Committee, that 7/6 a week should on the analogy of the exception made in the case of sick pay and benefits under the National Health Insurance Acts be ignored by Boards of Guardians in calculating the income of applicants for relief.I am advised that it would bo ultra vires to include any provisions in the Regulations allowing Guardians to Ignore the whole or part of any disability pension in considering an application for outdoor relief or in assessing the amount of relief to be granted,,     I cannot give any directions to the Guardians by circular or otherwise which would conflict with what I am advised is the state of the law. The utmost that I can do is to say that my Department will not, of themselves, take exception If a Board of Guardians does in fact ignore part of a disability pension in calculating outdoor relief, but there Is no action which I can take which would prevent any ratepayer from making objection before the auditor, and the auditor would in that case be bound to disallow and surchargeo     It is true that I might exercise my power of remission but this would only be the case where an appeal was made to me*     If tho appeal were made, as it might be, to the High Court, I can take no action.Further, in connection with the Regulations under the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act it is necessary to be particularly careful In view of the fact that any of the paying unions might challenge my action.In view,-however, of the fact that the claims upon the fund cannot be made, audited, and dealt with until some months after the completion of the half year
in respect of which the expenditure is incurred, there would be time, if the Cabinet so agreed, to deal with the matter by legislation next Session.     If the Cabinet agree I should be prepared to issue a circular to Boards of Guardians informing them that the Government propose to Introduce such legislation and tnatj In the event of it being passed, the claims upon the fund would be admitted in oases in which the Guardians had, in calculating the Income-of&apos;applicant a for outdoor relief, Ignored a proportion, say 7/6d. of a disability pensionsA.
