TREATY OF VERSAILLES (DELIVERIES in kind).I. AGREEMENT between the French and German Govern-ments concerning the Application of Part VIII. of the Treaty oe Versailles regarding Deliveries in Kind.PROTOCOL.With a view to facilitating the reconstruction of the devastated regions, the French and German Governments have agreed to approve and carry out the provisions of the enclosed memorandum and of its annex.It is understood that in the event of any discrepancy between the French and German texts of the Protocol, the memorandum and its annex, the French text will be authentic.In witness whereof, the undersigned,, duly authorised by their respective Governments, have signed the present Protocol and initialled the above-mentioned memorandum and its annex.Given in two copies at Wiesbaden,This sixth day of October, one thousand nine hundred and twenty one.(Signed) Lotjcheur. (Signed)      Rathenatj.MEMORANDUM.6th October 1921.The German Government has expressed its earnest desire to participate in the reconstruction of the devastated regions by delivering the greatest possible amount of plant and materials.The French Government took note of this offer, but replied that the law of 17th April 1919, relating to the reparation of war damages, did not allow it to impose upon the French &quot; sinistres &quot; any definite utilisation of their funds, and that in consequence the present memorandum could in no way supersede this law.The following has therefore been agreed :I.There shall be formed in Germany an &quot; organisme de droit prive &quot; for the delivery of plant and materials that may be required by the French &quot; sinistres &quot; grouped in a manner to be determined later by the French Government.x  (38)16336  m 1000 &amp; 90   11/21   E &amp; S B
The enclosed Annex fixes the rules which shall be followed by these organisations in regard to the fixing of prices and the methods of settling for such goods.II.The German Government declares that if, contrary to the argument that it advanced before the Committee of Guarantees, the Reparation Commission should decide that the deliveries made in execution of the obligations under Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles are to be included in the exports referred to in Articles 4 and 7 of the Schedule of Payments, it will be unable to execute the provisions of the present memorandum and its Annexe unless the provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of the Schedule of Payments are applied to the deliveries referred to in the present memorandum with the following modifications :The levy of 26 per cent, mentioned in Article 4 and that of 25 per cent, mentioned in Article 7 shall be made in the course of any year whatsoever during the period of the application of the present memorandum and its Annex, on that part only of the value of the deliveries credited to Germany and debited to France during the same year.The balance of the levy shall be paid by Germany each year as from 1st May 1926, at the rate of 26 per cent, and 25 per cent, respectively on the sums credited to her during the said year in connection with these deliveries.In other words, the deliveries effected in application of the provisions of the present memorandum shall only be included each year in the total German exports, for the execution of Articles 4 and 7 of the Schedule of Payments, pari passu with their payment.As this question is exclusively within the competence of the Reparation Commission and the Committee of Guarantees, it shall be submitted to them by the German Government. The French Government will support the German request before these two organisations.III.The French Government will submit to the approval of the Reparation Commission any other provisions of the present memorandum and of its Annex that may concern the Commis-sion.IV.The deliveries prescribed in Annexes III., V. and VI. to Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles will be continued in accord-ance with the procedure laid down in the Treaty.The French Government declares that, in so far as it is concerned, it is prepared to accept the application of the procedure laid down in the present memorandum and annex, by analogy
with the provisions of Article 8 of the Schedule of Payments, in so far as it will ensure the satisfactory delivery of plant and materials required in the reconstruction of the devastated regions and subject to the definite orders placed under Annex IV. prior to the signing of the present document; these orders shall continue to be executed in conformity with the procedure of Annex IV.The French Government however reserves the right to revert wholly or partially to this procedure, if it think fit, by giving notice one year in advance; also, by giving notice to the French Government one year in advance, not before 1st May 1923, the German Government may denounce the arrangements concluded by virtue of the present memorandum, with a view to reverting to the procedure of Annex IV. and Article 8 of the Schedule of Payments.If, on the initiative of either Government, the procedure of Annex IV. and Article 8 of the Schedule of Payments be reverted to, the German Government waives the right to claim any prescription whatsoever, in so far as the execution of Annex IV. is concerned, in regard to the time limits on account of the periods that have run during the application of the present memor-andum.The provisions of Article 8 of the Schedule of Payments which do not concern the restoration of the devastated regions are not affected by the present memorandum and its Annex.V.The French and German Governments agree to take the measures necessary to exempt the organisations whose creation is provided for in Paragraph 1 of the present memorandum from stamp duties, registration fees and similar taxes that might be due in connection with the deeds which they will have to draw up between them in execution of the enclosed Annex.VI.The French Government undertakes to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the deliveries of plant and materials made in application of the present memorandum and its Annex are applied only to the reconstitution of the devastated regions.VII.The application if necessary of paragraph 18 of Annex II. to Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles,-shall not constitute an obstacle to the crediting of Germany, in the form prescribed in Article VI. of the Annex to the present memorandum, of the sums due from F. to A.In the same way, the stocks of goods which the private organ-isation mentioned in Article 1 may have accumulated in FranceB 2
with a view to possible deliveries, and the funds which this organisation may have constituted in France in view of the execution of the provisions of the Annex to the present memoran-dum cannot be seized by virtue of the said paragraph 18.-    ANNEX TO MEMORANDUM.Agreement between F * of the one part,And A of the second part,It has been agreed as follows :article I.A undertakes to deliver to F at the request of the latter all plant and materials compatible with the productive capacity of Germany, her supply of raw materials and her domestic requirements, in so far as essential to the maintenance of her social and economic life, such deliveries-to begin with the signing of the Protocol to which the present contract is annexed.The present contract shall not, however, include the products prescribed in Annexes ILL, V., and VI. to Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles.The aggregate value of the deliveries to be made by Germany to France in execution of Annexes III., V. and VI., and of the deliveries to-be made by A to F in execution of the present contract, shall not exceed seven milliard gold marks during the period 1st October 1921 to 1st May 1926.Abtiole II.Upon the signing of the present contract a Commission shall be created consisting of three members, one French and one Cerman, to be nominated at the request of F and A by their respective Governments, and a third-member to be selected by common agreement between the two Govern-ments, whose mandate shall be limited to one year. Failing an agreement in regard to the choice of this third member, he shall be nominated by the-President of the Swiss Confederation for the time being. The Commission may secure the services, in a consultative capacity, of such experts as it. may deem necessary.The cost of this Commission and of its Services shall be paid by A but debited to F to the extent of 50 per cent.The Commission shall arbitrate all disputes that may arise between the two parties in connection with reasonable capacity of A to satisfy the requirements of F, special account being taken of the provisions of Article I..It shall settle all questions of prices in accordance with the conditions laid down by Article IV. and V. of the present contract.It shall settle all differences between F and A. particularly in regard-to transportation, delivery, reception, etc., and, in a general way, to the interpretation of the present contract.The decisions of the Commission shall be final.Article III.All goods shall be of good and marketable quality, in accordance with-the specifications upon which the orders are based, these orders being placed under the conditions and subject to the reservations laid down in. Articles I. and II.* F represents the French &quot; sinistres &quot; in general and A the German company-referred to in paragraph 1 of the memorandum.
In the absence of any special agreements, transportation shall be effected by the method of transport and in conformity with the itinerary that would normally be adopted as being the most advantageous by the consignor if he were bearing the cost of transport for the entire journey.Conditions of transport, delivery, reception, etc., shall be in accordance with commercial custom.Article IV.The prices for stock, material and goods manufactured in bulk shall be determined by the Arbitral Commission in accordance with the following principles. They shall not be applied to the orders placed by F with A, except in cases where no direct agreement has been concluded between the two parties :For each category and quality of goods, the Commission shall first of all fix the gold mark equivalent of the French pre-war price (first quarter of 1914) at the rate of 1,235 francs per 1 gold mark.It shall then determine, at the beginning of each calendar quarter and for that quarter, a coefficient applicable to the said category and quality of goods, and which may vary from one category and quality of goods to another. This coefficient shall be such that when applied to the price in gold marks defined in the preceding paragraph, and when the result is converted into francs, the resulting figure is equal to the price normally current at the beginning of the quarter on the French home market for goods of a similar category and quality, minus:(a) Customs duties;(6) Cost of transport.In the latter calculation the conversion into francs shall be based on the average of the official rates of exchange of the gold dollar quoted on the Paris Bourse during the IS days preceding the beginning of the quarter.The customs duties to be deducted shall be determined by multiplying by the above coefficient the duty levied in France on 1st July 1914 on German goods of the categories and qualities in question. The amount deducted shall, however, not exceed the duty levied at the beginning of the quarter on the German goods in question.The lump-sum cost of transportation to be deducted shall be determined on the basis of the scales normally in force on the railways at the beginning of the quarter and for the distance between Aix-la-Chapelle and Saint-Quentin.The gold mark prices obtained by.the application of the above co-efficients to the 1914 gold mark prices refer to prices at the German-Belgian or Franco-German frontier stations, or in port in the North of France as far as and including the ports of the estuary of the Seine.These prices shall be valid for all orders placed during the quarter for which they have been determined.They shall be revised in due time every quarter and in such a way as not to delay the placing of orders.The first schedule of prices shall as far as possible be prepared before 1st October 1921, in order that it may be applied to orders for the last quarter 1921: it may be completed retroactively if necessary.In case the prices fixed as above are more than 5 per cent, lower than the prices current in Germany for the same goods, A shall have the right not to carry out the delivery requested. Nevertheless, in cases which may be laid before it by F, the Commission referred to in Article II. shall decide whether the goods requested cannot actually , be obtained in Germany except at prices more than 5 per cent, higher than those which have been fixed in the conditions laid down in the present Article. It is further prescribed that the value of the deliveries the price of which is thus lower than the prices current in Germany, shall not exceed&apos;5 per cent, of the deliveries made during the year in question.
Article V.The prices of special material such as machinery or industrial plant shall be determined by direct agreement between the parties concerned.Failing such direct agreement in regard to any special material which, in application of Annex IV., has been included in the lists delivered to Germany, the French Government may claim delivery through the Reparation Commission, in accordance with the procedure of Annex IV.Article VI.A hereby declares himself acquainted with the provisions of the Schedule of Payments notified to the German Government by the Repara-tion Commission on 5th May 1921, and agrees, on receipt of a notification from F, to consider himself as duly paid out of the sums due during the corresponding year by the entry of any sum whatsoever to the credit of Germany and to the debit of France in the accounts of the Reparation Commission. In this case; the simple notification by the Reparation Commission to the German Government of a credit entry to Germany of the sum in question shall be equivalent to a discharge of F in regard to A for this amount.Article VII.Settlement for the deliveries by F to A shall be effected under the following conditions :1. F shall credit A with a sum equal to 35 per cent, of the value of the deliveries made in the course of a month in the manner prescribed in Article VI. above, and subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the present Article and of Article XI hereinafter. *2. If, in the course of any year whatsoever beginning with 1st May 1922&apos;, the value of the deliveries made by A to F under the terms of the present contract is less than one milliard gold marks, the percentage prescribed in paragraph 1 above of the credits to be given by F to A, shall be increased to 45 per cent.3. The cumulative total of the annual credits thus given and of the annual credits given by the French Government against the deliveries received by France under Annexes III., V. and VI. to Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles, shall not exceed one milliard gold marks.If the value of the deliveries received by France in execution of &quot;Annexes-III., V. and VI. of the Treaty reaches or exceeds one milliard gold marks during any one year between 1st May 1921 and 1st May 1926, no credit shall be given in the corresponding year by F to A in respect of the deliveries made by the latter.4. The sums due from F shall bear simple interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum as from the beginning of the month following that of the delivery; the part of these sums for which the settlement prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 above has not been effected shall be repayable by F under the conditions determined in Articles. .VIII. to XL hereinafter, as from 1st May 1926, and at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum plus the sifnple interest accrued each year.5. The deliveries which, notwithstanding the provisions, of Article I., may have been effected between 1st October 1921 and 1st May 1926, over and above a total value of seven milliard gold marks shall, within a period of three months, as from 1st May 1926, be paid to A in the manner prescribed in Article &quot;VI. above..* The following additional paragraph should, be inserted here. (Letter-front M. LoUcheur to Heir Raihenau, 7th October 1921,.at Wiesbaden):&quot;.During the first, five years its from the coming into force of the present contract, f shall credit A with the. total value of the first deliveries made in the.course.of any year whatsoever in the manner prescribed in Article VI. up-to a total amount of 32 million gold marks.&quot;
Article VIII.The aggregate value of the deliveries in kind and of the credits given by F to A in the manner prescribed in Article VI. shall not exceed, one milliard gold marks per annum.The reserve inserted in Article XI. applies to the above paragraph.Article IX.On 1st May 1936, a computation will be made of the sums remaining due to A, for deliveries in kind made since 1st October 1921, for which no credit has been given; the balance will be paid to A with compound interest at 5 per cent.* in four half-yearly payments, on 30th June and 31st December 1936, and 30th June and 31st December 1937, subject^to the provisions of Article XI. below.Article X.A&apos;s debit account, as well as his credit account, will bear 5 per cent, simple interest per annum.In case F has effected settlements in excess of the limits fixed iii. Articles VII., VIII., and XI., the surplus will be deducted from the settle-ments to be effected by F to A in the course of the following year.In case the value to be taken into account under the terms of the present contract for the deliveries made during any year whatsoever between 1st May 1926 and 1st May 1936, together with the yearly repay-ments to be made during the same period, amounts to more than one milliard gold marks, the surplus shall be carried forward successively to each of the following years, and settled in the course of these years in so far as the value to be taken into account for the deliveries made during one of these years, together with the yearly repayment due, is less than one milliard.The above provisions are, however, subject to the reservation made in Article XL below.Article XI.The settlements to be effected each year by F to A, in application of the present contract shall never exceed an amount such that, by adding this amount to the settlements effected during the same year by the French Government against deliveries made to France under Annexes III., V. and VI. to Part VEIL of the Treaty of Versailles, a total is obtained higher than France&apos;s share (52 per cent.) in the payments made by Germany or on her behalf during the said year, in payment of her debt of that year, as defined in Article 4 of the Schedule of Payments.Beginning with 1st May 1936, A shall be entitled not to make the further deliveries asked from him by F, whenever the execution of these deliveries would bring the obligations of F to give credit to A to an amount exceeding, for one year, the limit fixed by the present article.Article XII. F may at any time pay off his debts before maturity.* Extract from the Minutes of Wiesbaden, 7th October (Par. 5): It&apos; was agreed that&apos; the&quot;5 per cent, compound interest ori the sums still owing to A on 1st May 1936; for deliveries in kind made since 1st&quot; October 1921, for which, he had received no credit, would be computed as from the said date to 1st May 1936.
II. DECISION of the Reparation Commission on 20th October 1921 after considering the Franco-German Agreement of 6th October 1921.British Delegation,Reparation Commission, Astoria, Paris,May it please Your Lordships, 21st October 1921.In the absence of Sir John Bradbury, and with reference to his Report No. 216 of the 11th instant, I have the honour to report that, at a special meeting of the Commission held yesterday to consider the terms of the agreement between the French and German Governments concerning the application of Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles regarding deliveries in kind, the following decision was adopted : &quot; The French Government, having submitted to the Reparation Commission in accordance with Paragraph 3 of the memorandum thereto attached the Agreement between the representatives of the French and German Governments signed at Wiesbaden on the 6th instant, the Commission has come to the following decision : &quot; (1) It entirely approves the general principles underlying the Agreement whereby special ar-rangements are proposed for enabling Germany to liquidate the largest possible proportion of her reparation obligations in the form of goods and services, more especially with a view to the speedier restoration of the Devastated Regions.&quot; (2) At the same time, it considers that the Agree-ment involves certain departures from the pro-visions of Part VIII. of the Treaty of Versailles, notably Article 237, Paragraphs 12 and 19 of Annex II. and Paragraph 5 of Annex IV.&quot; (3) As the Commission has no power to authorise such departures, it decides to refer the question to the Governments represented on the Commission, ,; . with a copy of the memorandum and its annex,recommending a favourable examination of them.&quot; (4) The Commission recommends that reasonable facilities for deferred payment in respect of the exceptional volume which, if the arrangements are successful, the deliveries in kind to France are likely to assume during the next few years,
II. Decision. 11should be accorded to France, subject to any safeguards which the Allied Governments may regard as necessary to protect their respective interests.&quot;A copy of this report is being forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Paris.I have the honour to be, Your Lordships&apos; Most obedient humble Servant, (Signed)     B. A. Kemball-Cook.The Lords Commissioners, His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, Whitehall, S.W.1.III.-REPORT from Sir John Bradbury, G.C.B., British Delegate, Reparation Commission, on the subject of the Franco-German Agreement of 6th October 1921.British Delegation,Reparation Commission, Astoria, Paris,May it Please Your Lordships, 26th October 1921.In continuation of Mr. Kemball Cook&apos;s Report No. 222 of the 21st instant, transmitting a copy of the unanimous reso-lution of the Reparation Commission of the 20th instant deciding to refer the Wiesbaden Agreement to the Allied Governments for their consideration, I have now the honour to submit-to Your Lordships a *Memorandum, explanatory of the Agreement, which has been prepared in the Office of the British Delegation, together with the following observations.The obvious purpose of the Agreement with which all the -members of the Commission are wholly in sympathy is to secure the largest possible contribution by Germany to the early restora-tion of the devastated areas of France in the form of deliveries in kind, without the consequential inconvenience which under the operation of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and the existing inter-Allied Agreements, as they stand, must neces-sarily be caused to France by reason of her having to account to the other Allies immediately for their proportionate shares in the value of such deliveries.The Agreement seeks to effect this double object by excluding from the immediate operation of the financial provisions of the* See Paper No. IV.
Treaty a large proportion of the value of all deliveries in kind by Germany to France during the next 14 years-the value of the deliveries so excluded being ultimately brought under the opera-tion of these provisions as and when within the 14 years&apos; period the deliveries fall below an annual limit of one milliard gold marks, and, in so far as the excess is not liquidated within, that period; against the receipts which would otherwise accrue to France in respect of German reparation after the end of the period.The broad result of the proposed arrangements, the details of which, as will be seen from the accompanying memorandum, are of a very complicated character, would be that during the next 14 years Germany would be entitled to reckon towards the discharge of her obligations under the Schedule of Payments a maximum of one milliard gold marks per annum in respect of her deliveries in kind to France, whatever total these deliveries, might in fact attain. She would thus be assuming a burden additional to that laid upon her by the Reparation Commission under the Treaty equivalent to the value of the excess of the actual deliveries over this amount.Regard being had to what has been said and written in Germany, not merely by the general public but by responsible-members of the Government, of the difficulty anticipated in carrying out the obligations imposed by the Schedule of Payments themselves, it is somewhat remarkable that Germany should now be prepared voluntarily to assume this additional burden.Doubtless amongst the reasons which have led to her to-do so are a genuine desire on the part of the present German Government to remove the open sore constituted by the ruins of northern France, and a belief probably well founded that the industrial and financial circumstances of Germany at the present time are such that it is advantageous to purchase a: measure of relief from the burden of finding foreign currencies-even at the expense of a more than equivalent obligation which can be discharged by the export of merchandise.But when full weight has been given to these considerations, the fact remains that the potential dimensions of the additional burden are so great that it would be unwise to assume that it can be borne without prejudice to the performance by Germany of her obligations under the Schedule of Payments.If there were reasonable grounds for anticipating that the obligations under the Schedule of Payments could be main-tained, and would be discharged, in full, during the whole of the period contemplated by the Wiesbaden Agreement, the excess deliveries to France being made in addition, it would be hot unreasonable to allow to France the full advantage of the accele-ration in the payment of her share of reparation for Which she has been able to arrange.The obligations of the Schedule of Payments were, however, fixed as recently as May last, and they then represented, in the opinion of the Reparation Commission and of the Allied!
III. Report.13Governments, the maximum burden which in the light of the indications available Germany could be expected to be able to bear..The payment of the initial instalment of 1 milliard gold marks has, as Your Lordships are aware, been followed by a heavy depreciation in the exchange value of the mark, artd the work of the Committee of Guarantees has not yet reached a point at which the payment of the remaining instalments even for the current reparation year can be regarded as secured. , . In the event of the German Government finding itself in difficulties in regard to these or subsequent instalments, it is inevitable (whatever may be its intentions at the present time) that the additional obligations undertaken to France would not only be pleaded as a ground for consideration, but would, in fact, constitute in favour of such consideration a plea which could not be ignored by the Allied Governments.It results from these considerations that the contingency in which the additional deliveries to France would have, in substance, to be treated by the Allied Powers as a whole  notwithstanding the provisions for deferred credit contained in the agreement-as an integral part of the current effort of Germany to satisfy her treaty obligations is one which cannot be left out of account.If that contingency should arise, the effect of the agreement would be, not that, thanks to a special voluntary effort on the part of Germany, France would have secured, without prejudice to her Allies, a part of her share&apos; of reparation earlier than would otherwise have been possible, but merely that an alteration in favour of France and to the detriment of the other Allies would have been brought about in the distribution as between the Allies of the available reparation receipts over a very considerable period. The other Allies would, in substance, be advancing to France on a 5 per cent, basis their shares of that part of the annual reparation payments of Germany with which France was not currently charged, on the security not of the French. Government but of the French share of whatever may be the current receipts in respect of German reparation in the somewhat remote future.Opinions may differ as to the precise value of this security, but, unless the other Alhed Powers are prepared to modify in favour of France the existing treaty provisions and interallied agreements relating to priorities and to the distribution of reparation receipts, it can hardly be regarded as in itself pro-viding adequate protection for the rights of the other Allies, and further safeguards will be required.As such safeguards must necessarily involve in certain con-contingencies the payment by France to the other Allies of amounts equal in all to 48 per cent, (or, until existing priorities have been disposed of, an even larger proportion) of the aggregate values for which debit stands deferred, it is clearly in the interest; both
of France herself and of the other Allies, that precise limits should be prescribed to this liability, in respect both of time and of amount.The safeguards which are envisaged as necessary by my Italian and Belgian colleagues on the Reparation Commission and myself, and for which we presume that our respective Governments will desire to stipulate are : (1) that a.limit of time should be laid down after the expiration of which no new deferment of debit should be permitted and the liquidation of the existing deferred debits should commence to be made by regular annual instalments.The precise length of this period should be determined upon an estimate of the time necessary to carry out the main work of reconstruction, regard being had to the time required by Germany to effect the necessary supplies. In view of the delays which are inevitable in regard to operations of the magnitude of those contemplated, the prescribed period might be reasonably somewhat longer than the four and a half years initial period under the agreement, but it should not exceed seven years;(2) that in no circumstances should the aggregate amount for which debit against France for the time being stands deferred be allowed to exceed a prescribed amount, say, 4 milliard gold marks ;(3) that a provision should be inserted for the payment by France to the general reparation account from time to time (within the limits of the deferred debits for the time being outstanding) of any amounts which may be necessary to secure that the other Allies shall receive their proper proportions of the amounts due from Germany under the Schedule of Payments.Subject to the introduction of these safeguards, to which it would not appear that legitimate exception could be taken, the arrangements contemplated by the agreement may be expected to accelerate the solution of the Reparation problem on practical lines in a manner advantageous to France without prejudicing the interests of other Powers, and it is upon this ground that the Reparation Commission has unanimously recommended them for favourable examination by the Allied Governments.If the Allied Governments approve&apos; the general scheme, subject to whatever safeguards they may decide to be necessary, there will remain certain subsidiary points for the Reparation Commission to consider amongst other :--&apos;       (1) The proposed omission of the excess deliveries from the index figure determining the annual liability under the .    Schedule of Payments, until such time as these deliveries are finally brought to account for reparation purposes. (2) The special arrangements for substitution in respect s*   of articles of which France is entitled to restitution by identity, involving in certain cases money payments; and
III.-Report.15.(3) The special arrangements in regard to the delivery of coal and the prices to be credited and debited, which in several particulars affect the interest of other Powers.These subsidiary questions cannot, however, well be dealt with until the Allied Governments have pronounced upon the general plan.I have the honour to be, Your Lordships&apos; Most obedient humble Servant, The Lords Commissioners, John Bradbury.His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, Whitehall, S.W.1.IV.-EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM.In order to understand the arrangements proposed, by the Wiesbaden Agreement, it is necessary to bear in mind certain provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, the application of which is affected by it.The Treaty itself provides in the Reparation Chapter, Part VIII, and in some of its Annexes, for the partial liquidation of Germany&apos;s reparation indebtedness by deliveries in kind. The important passages in this connection are paragraph 19 of Annex II and Annex IV, which together make extensive provision for the delivery, through the Reparation Commission, to the Allied and Associated Powers of machinery, equipment, tools, recon-struction material and,, in general, all such material and labour as is necessary to enable any Allied Power to proceed with the restoration or development of its industrial or economic life.Germany&apos;s obligation being stated in terms of gold and not in terms of commodities, provision has necessarily been made in all cases for crediting Germany, from time to time, with the fair value, as assessed by the Reparation Commission, of such deliveries. Moreover, since, the proportions received by the-respective Powers in kind need not necessarily correspond exactly with their respective shares in Germany&apos;s reparation payments, as determined by Inter-Allied agreement, provision is further necessarily made in the Treaty to render each Power accountable not only to Germany, but to the Reparation Corn-mission, for the value of these deliveries. Thus, on the one hand, the Treaty&apos;stipulates as between the Allies and Germany that the value of services under the Annexes shall be credited towards the liquidation of Germany&apos;s general obligation, and the Schedule of Payments assigns the value of Annex deliveries to the service of the bonds handed over by Germany as security for her debt. On the other hand, the Treaty provides that for the purpose of equitable distribution as between the Allies, the value of Annex deliveries shall be reckoned in the same manner as cash
* The arrangement tinder which a German private company is to be created to deal directly with the orders without the intervention of the French and German Governments is intended to obviate the delays which experience has shown to be inseparable from the employment of the present machinery. It does not appear to have any important bearing on the general financial situation, since the deliveries will clearly have to be financed by the German Government and will ultimately be paid for by means of a reparation credit in account with the German Government.payments effected in the year, and the Schedule of Payments stipulates that the value of the deliveries received by each Power shall, within one month of the date of delivery, be paid over to the Reparation Commission, either in cash or in current coupons.Further, the Treaty imposes upon the Reparation Commission not only the duty of fixing prices, but also of determining the capacity of Germany to deliver goods demanded by any of the Allies, and, by implication, of deciding between the competing demands which are made upon that capacity by the Allies themselves.The Wiesbaden Agreement provides for the delivery by a Germany company * to French &quot; sinistres &quot; of &quot;all plant and materials compatible with the productive capacity of Germany, her supply of raw materials and her domestic requirements,&quot; that is to say, of the articles and materials which can be demanded under Annex IV and Paragraph 19 of Annex II, which are, by the terms of the Agreement, in so far as France is concerned virtually suspended, the obligations of Germany to deliver to France under the other Annexes remaining unaffected.Any question as to the capacity of Germany to satisfy the requirement of France, and all questions of price, are to be settled by a Commission of three members, one French and one German, and a third selected by common agreement or nominated by the Swiss President.The aggregate value of the deliveries to be made under the Agreement, and of the deliveries to be made under Annexes III, V and VI (hereafter, for the sake of brevity, called the &quot; Annex deliveries &quot;) in the period expiring on the 1st May 1926 is fixed at a maximum of 7 milliard gold marks.In regard to the Annex deliveries the Agreement in no way modifies the Treaty provisions under which Germany is credited and France debited forthwith with the value, but special provisions, which are financially the essential part of the Agree-ment, are made for bringing to reparation account the value of the Agreement deliveries. These special provisions are designed to secure that Germany shall only be credited on reparation account at the time of delivery with a certain proportion of them, and that deliveries not thus accounted for, which may be called &quot; excess deliveries,&quot; shall be liquidated over a period of years beginning at the earliest on 1st May 1926. The provisions themselves are somewhat intricate, comprising,
as they do, a series of interacting limitations, and they require some elucidation.(1) In no case is credit to be given to Germany in any one year for Annex and Agreement deliveries together, to an amount exceeding one milliard gold marks.(2) In no case is credit to be given to Germany in any one year for more than 45 per cent, of the value of the Agreement deliveries or for more than 35 per cent, if the value of the Agreement deliveries exceeds one milliard gold marks.The effect of the above is to prescribe that 55 per cent, (or, if the Agreement operates successfully, 65 per cent.) of the value of the Agreement deliveries as a minimum will be the object of deferred payment by instalments, If the Agreement deliveries reached really high figures, the operation of the milliard limitation would make the carry forward much more than 65 per cent.The excess deliveries are to be liquidated with interest at 5 per cent, per annum in 10 equal annual instalments as from 1st May 1926, subject to certain conditions : (1) France shah in no case be debited in one year for Agreement deliveries with an amount which, when added &quot;to the value of her Annex deliveries in that year, would make her responsible for more than her share (52 per cent.) of the total reparation payments made by Germany in that year.(2) Agreement deliveries continue after 1st May 1926, with the same provisions for deferred payment. If in any year between May 1926 and May 1936 the amount (not exceeding 35 or 45 per cent.) of the value of that year&apos;s Agreement deliveries to be credited to Germany, together with the annual instalment to repay the debt incurred in respect of the period ending 1st May 1926, exceeds one milliard, the excess is to be carried forward from year to year until a year is reached in which no such excess is created by the payment. But in no case shall the amount credited, even if it is less than one milliard gold marks, exceed the limit laid down by the preceding condition.(3) Any balance with which Germany has not been credited on 1st May 1936 is to be credited to her with compound interest at 5 per cent, in four half-yearly payments on 30th June and 31st December 1936 and 30th June and 31st December 1937. But, again, these half-yearly payments shall not be made if the effect of making them would be to exceed the limit laid down in Condition 1 above.(4) Agreement deliveries continue indefinitely after 1st May 1936, with power, however, to Germany to arrest
them whenever the execution of them would result in France-owing more than 52 per cent, of Germany&apos;s annual reparation payment in respect of Annex deliveries, deferred payments already matured, and the 35 or 45 per cent, of current deliveries.From the above it is to be noted that, while there is a limitation for the first five years of the amount of Agreement deliveries which can be demanded, there is : (1) No point at which the right of France to demand these special deliveries automatically terminates;(2) No final limitation upon the value of the deliveries which can be demanded by France during the lifetime of the Agreement;(3) No definitely prescribed period within which France&apos;s debt to Germany and to the other partners in reparation shall be liquidated.The financial effect of the Agreement is perhaps best shown by taking hypothetical examples.Let it be assumed that Germany&apos;s annual reparation obligation under the Schedule of Payments amounts to 3,300,000,000 gold marks, of which France, under existing inter-Allied Agreements, is entitled to receive 52 per cent., or, 1,700,000,000 gold marks. Let it be assumed again that France receives annual Annex deliveries to the value of 450,000,000 gold marks. The Annex and Agreement deliveries together in the first five years are not to exceed 7,000,000,000 gold marks. Five years&apos; Annex deliveries, on the above hypothesis, amount to 2,250,000,000 gold marks, leaving a maximum value of 4,750,000,000 gold marks for the Agreement deliveries over the same period. Let it be assumed that the Agreement deliveries are spread equally over the five-year period, with the result that their annual value amounts to 950,000,000 gold marks. In the first year, 1921-22, it is specially provided that not more than 35 per cent, shall be credited to Germany, or 332,500,000 gold marks, leaving payment to be deferred of 61-7,500,000 gold marks. In the second and subsequent years, up to May 1926, 45 per cent, of the 950,000,000 gold marks, or 427,500,000 gold marks, would be credited, leaving 522,500,000 gold marks to be deferred. At the end of the period, therefore, France would owe a total of 2,707,500,000 gold marks, together with simple interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum.Leaving out of account the complication of interest, France is to liquidate this debt in 10 equal annual instalments of 270,750,000 gold marks, subject to certain conditions, and the effect of these conditions must be stated with the aid of further hypothetical figures. Let it be assumed that the amount of Germany&apos;s annual reparation obligation and the amount of France&apos;s Annex deliveries remain constant, and let it further be assumed that France continues to call for Agreement deliveries
to the value of 500,000,000 gold marks a year. France will then be debited for the year 1926-27 with 450,000,000 gold marks for Annex deliveries, 270,750,000 gold marks for the earlier Agreement deliveries, and 225,000,000 gold marks, being 45 per cent, of the current year&apos;s Agreement deliveries, making in all a total of 945,750,000 gold marks. She will have paid off 270,750,000 gold marks, but have incurred a fresh debt of 275,000,000 gold marks. She will then owe 4,250,000 gold marks more on the 1st May 1927 than she owed on the 1st May 1926.   This process might continue until 1st May 1936.Should the Agreement deliveries continue on a higher scale, France&apos;s debt would be more heavily increased in proportion. Let it be assumed, for example, that the Agreement deliveries in the year in question amounted to a value of 900,000,000 gold marks. France cannot be called upon to pay more in a year than one milliard. She will have to pay in respect of Annex deliveries and previous Agreement deliveries a total of 720,750,000 gold marks. If follows, therefore, that not more than 279,250,000 gold marks out of 900,000,000 gold marks, which represent the hypothetical value of that year&apos;s Agreement deliveries, will be paid for, leaving a total of 620,750,000 gold marks to carry forward, and an increase in France&apos;s debt of 350,000,000 gold marks.The results might be indefinitely varied by choosing different figures for any one of the factors which enters into the problem. It is perhaps unnecessary, however, for the sake of seeing the effect of the Agreement, to vary the above hypotheses in more than one respect. It is desirable to consider the effect on the above calculations of a decrease whether by reason of an actual German default or through a postponement regularly accorded by the Reparation Commission under Article 234 of the Treaty, in the amount effectively paid by Germany on reparation account in any one year.Let it be assumed, for instance, that Germany pays on repara-tion account in the year 1922-23 only 1,000,000,000 gold marks, of which France is entitled to 520,000,000 gold marks. She cannot be debited in that year with more than 520,000,000 gold marks, and she is automatically debited to the extent of 450,000,000 gold marks for Annex deliveries. Credit will there-fore be given to Germany for no more than 70,000,000 gold marks in respect of Agreement deliveries, leaving a deferred payment of no less than 880,000,000 gold marks effectively paid to France by Germany and not available for distribution among the other Allies before, at the earliest, 1926-27. A continued failure by Germany to pay on account of reparation the amount contemplated at the beginning of these calculations would proportionately increase the amount deferred and therefore the size of the ten annual instalments which, subject always to the conditions indicated- above, begin to be credited to Germany after 1st May 1926. Continued failure on Germany&apos;s part after May 1926, combined with the continued operation of the Agree-
Printed under the authority of His Majestst&apos;8 StatkWerst OffIoS . By Eyre and Spottiswoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.C. i, Printers to the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty/ -ment deliveries, would result in a more and more rapid accumula-tion of French indebtedness in the subsequent period for which no means of Hquidation is provided.&apos; It remains necessary to draw attention to one subsidiary point of a financial character under the Schedule of Payments. Part of Germany&apos;s annual reparation liabihty consists of the payment of 26 per cent, of the value of German exports in each period of twelve months, and part of the security for the payment consists of the proceeds of a levy of 25 per cent; on the value of all German exports. The French Government has under-taken to support a request, to be submitted by the German Government to the Reparation Commission, for the inclusion in the exports which form the basis of these calculations of that part only of the value of the deliveries made under the Agreement which is credited to Germany and debited to France during any particular year.If it can be assumed that any part of the special deliveries to be made under the Agreement would, in the absence of the Agreement, have been diverted to Germany&apos;s ordinary external trade, then the concession desired will have the effect of dimih-Fishing the annual payments made by Germany for the benefit of the Allies as a whole..  26th October 1921.
