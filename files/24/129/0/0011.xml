r/l4(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1921.CABINET.to(    CP,   341/1   ) ^USBAIL G&amp;^p&apos; Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.My colleagues will have read the Bolshevik Note in answer to the Note approved by the Cabinet and despatched on the 7th September.As is well known, the facts were collected from various Departments and documents by my officers and presented to the Cabinet after they had been submitted to the Attorney-General.I have considered carefully the denials of M. Chicherin, and I ask the Cabinet to accept from me the assurance that we adhere to our statements, which can be fully substantiated.I can do no more by Cabinet memoranda, and I would deprecate an argument with the Soviet Government which would help them in exploring our sources of information. But Major Bray of the India Office, could, I think, satisfy any one of my colleagues sufficiently interested, that the impudent denials and accusations of. the Soviet Government are baseless, and that our information is correct.E. S. M.14th October 1921.4.721      100   10.21
