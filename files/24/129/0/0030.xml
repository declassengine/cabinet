A* of Appendix I.Uniform is being more openly worn by rebel leaders (see para, (b) Appendix I.)Sinn Fein Courts are reported from all areas and are undoubtedly on the Increase.Republican Polico are everywhere usurping the functions of. the R.I.C. who make little effort to assert themselves, and the &quot;arrest&apos; of persons required to stand their trial before such Courts has become prevalent.       There have also been instances of the kidnapping &amp;t individuals who were due to give evidence in His Majesty1a Courts.   Examples of this procedure are shown in para, (c) Appendix I.Cases of interference with members of the Crown Forces are not n-merous, but a few will be found in para, (d) of Appendix I.It is, perhaps, too early to judge whether the fact that the Irish Representatives are in Conference in London, will have the effect of reducing these rebel^activities, but from many boastful speeches by Sinn Fein leaders at Meetings in the Country, it is apparent that there is a strong element which desires to maintain and strengthen the power of the I.E.,A.The effect of all these activities is to make the position of the Crown Forces in Ireland very difficult, a difficulty which in ray opinion would not have been so great had the police carried out from the first their duty of preventing what were obviously breaches of the Truce.(Signed)     C .F * N .MAC READY,general  Commanding-ln-Chief, IRELAND.GHQ, Ireland,18th October, iy l.
