Wireless Telegraphy and Visual Signalling; Bill,In the autumn of 1920 a Bill, to &quot;amend tho wireless Telegraphy Act 1904 was circulated in the Cabinet with a covering memorandum (copy attached) explaining ito chiof points.    The Colonial Office dosired the inclusion in the Bill of a clause exempting from its provisions Dominion ships (and aircraft) when outside the limits of the British Isles.    The Post Office had no objection to this clause, which represents what had bean and was intended in future to be the policy followed, viz:- that the Dominions should licence and control the.use of wireless telegraphy in their own ships. Objection was, however, taken by the Solicitor. General who considered it undesirable on constitutional grounds to declare British Ships on the -High Seas exempt from the authority of the,Imperial Government, and the matter was left over for later consideration.It is desirable that c&amp;tpa should no?/ be taken to settle.the Bill, in order that it may be introduced into Parliament at an early date in the new year. .   The proposed amendments of the&apos;1964 Act are necessary for the regulation of wireless stations in tho interests of all concerned, and the present system of licensing-experimental stations is in point of fact based on them.    No objection has been taken by the public, but it is clearly unsatisfactory that the administrative procedure Bhould appear in any way to diverge from the Act. Moreover there,is at present no power to control visual signalling stations;   and the Admiralty, it is understood, are anxious that such power should be obtained,-In these circumstances, authority is requested to introduce the Bill early in the next Session, with any amendment which may be necessary to reconcile the view of the Colonial Office and the Solicitor General,(Sd,) F.&amp;.

Referred to Committee of Home affairs for   INFOB0TIOH.GABINET    .CP. 1953. This Document ig the Property, of2 Whitehall Gardens, -        HS T&amp;alannib MaiegHv:g Government.,SECRET.WITNESS TILEGRAH-IY&quot; AND VISUAL, SIGNALLING BILL 1920This Bill amends the Fireless Telegraphy Act 1904 whioh empowers the -Postmaster General to control wireless telegraph installations in tho United Kingdom,     Suchv control is necessary in order to prevent improper U3e of wireless in time of peace and to enable the State to close private stations promptly in time of emergency.Pre-war experience had shown that the position of the Government in regard to the grant of licences for wireless experiments required strengthening, and the matter was referred to an inter-Departmental Committee.    The Bill embodies the recommendations of the Committee.With the extended use of wireless telegraphy and telephony, the risk of interference, unless the installations are under proper control, has become greater;   and all countries hive found that such control is necessary if wireless is to achieve its proper functions.It is not intended to withhold from the public any of the advantages of wireless communication; and full scope is left to inventive genius by allowing the erection of experimental stations in proper hands.     Permission&apos; is, and will be, readily given for receiving stations; and. t^-fismitting stations of small power will be allowed with practically equal freedom when the applicants can show that they are serious students of wireless, and where there is no risk of interference with Government or commercial stations in the immediate locality; but applications for the use of larger power at transmittingstations
stations will have to be more carefully scrutinised than before the war.The main points in the Bill are:-k &apos; Removal of obligation to Q;rant experimental licenceswithout rent or r qya 1 oy,The 1904 Act provides that the Postmaster General, whensatisfied that a licence is required solely for experiments,shall grant the licence and shall charge no rent or. royalty.It is considered tfeit he should have power to refuse a licence,for example to a foreigner or to a person otherwise unsuitable,and also that he should have, power., to make an- annual charge inrespect of experimental licences, in order to; meet the expensefjf Issuing the licence and of.periodically inspecting thestation.    The Bi.ll accordingly provides (Section.- 5) -for- the repeal of the relative part of the Act,11.   Power to.make regulations.Section 2 of the Bill empowers the Postmaster General to make regulations as to the issue of licences and operators&apos; certificates and the observance of the International Wireless Convention and Regulations.    These points, arid also those dealt with in Section 4 of the Bill, have, to. some extent been met previously by clauses in the licences, but it. is desired&apos; to give the rules a statutory sanction which will enable bad cases of infringement to be dealt with more strictly than, by a mere withdrawal of the. licence.The provision in Section 2, 1 (c) as to prevention of interference with wireless telegraphy by the generation or use of electric waves for other purposes, will not affect power plants or railways or other installations which transmit power by wire,     It is directed against the use of Hertzian waves for non-telegraphic purposes where this would cause interference wi Government or Commercial wireless telegraphy..    . -. . 111.
111*   Application to Aircraft. (Section 6 of the Bill),It ia proposed that vhen wireless i3 used in aircraft a licence from the Post Office ntist be held and the Operator!mist be certificated.    The object is to ensure a properstandard of equipment and operating,     The Air Ministryconsiders this provision essential,. IV,   Application to Visual, Signalling; from the shore .&quot;to;ships lit sea TSeotion i&apos;X*    &apos;       &quot;The Admiralty consider it necessary, in order tofacilitate the closing down of visual signalling stations in-time, of emergency, that all stations (except Lleyda)established for the purposo of signalling from the shore.tp.ships at sea should be licensed.    The section was drawn up in consultation between the Admiralty and Boardof Trade.. &quot;V, Control in ISmergencv,&apos;Daring the war, control of the possession, transfer and use of apparatus was obtained by Regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act,     It is proposed (Section 8 of the . Bill) to give the.Postmaster General power to take similar control in case of emergency and so to avoid the delay &apos; which, might bo entailed, in a 3udden emergency f&apos; in . obtaining the necessary legislative&apos;authority, &apos; &apos; . iVI. Increase, of Psnaltien.Th9 increase of the maximum penalties on sumrriary conviction (section 5) was recommended by the Inter Departmental Committee in order to facilitate settlement   &apos;&apos; of the cases by summary procedure,(SgaV) Albert H.
