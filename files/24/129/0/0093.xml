/ r.....,/ -fjfc.....S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).MERCHANDISE MARKS BILL. Memorandum, by the President of the Board of Trade.An earlier draft of the Merchandise Marks Bill was submitted to the Cabinet with a Memorandum (OP-2491) by my predecessor, Sir Robert Home, in January last, and was re-ferred to tho Committee of Home Affairs.   The Bill, however, has not yet been considered by the Committee, and the draft which X am now submitting contains some Important new olauses.A word of explanation is desirable.   In August, 1920, the Homo Affairs Committee, at their 72nd Meeting, had before them two draft War Office Bills, The Prevention of Frauds (Government Contracts) Bill (CP-1679) and The GovernmentMarks Bill (CP-1678).   The Committee agreod that the twocertain amendments.   This was done and the new draft Bill, under the title of The Government Contracts and Marks Bill, was ready in February last.   In the meantime, as stated above,the Board of Trade1s draft Merchandise Marks Bill had been sent in to the Cabinet, and Parliamentary Counsel suggested that the provisions of the combined Contracts and Marks Bill, in eo far as they related to Government Marks, might more appropriately be lnoluded in the Merchandise Marks Bill. This suggestion has been followed out;   the draft of the Merchandise Marks Bill which I now enclose, contains thesubstance of the amended provisions about Government Marks, whilst the provisions which were originally contained in the Prevention of Frauds (Government Contracts) Bill have been left out as being, at least to some extent, outside the scope of the Merchandise Larks Lrw,Bills should be combined and a new draft prepared Incorporating
Part I of tho Merchandise Marks Bill Is the main portion and Is based on the Report of the Merchandise Marks Committee appointed by Sir Auckland Geddes.r which published its Report in Jane 1920 (Uaid.760H   Part II of the Bill deals with the Government Marks and a Part III has also been added on the suggestion of, and after collaboration with, the Home Office, with a view to tightening up the existing legislation in regard to the unauthorised use of Royal arms, devices and titles.I do not think that these changes make it necessary to add very much to the observations in Sir Robert Home^ Memorandum already referred to.   I may, however, say that the Report of the Merchandise Marks Committee has been reoeived by the public with favour and that the general provisions of the Bill in its present shape (i.e, including the additional Parts II and III) have been considered by the Advisory Council of the Board of Trade, which embraces representatives of most of the principal trades of the country, and have met with their general approvalsA large number of questions have been addressed to me in the House Of Commons a3 to when it is the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill on this subject; and, as will be seen from Sir R. Homo&apos;s Memorandum, a promise was given to introduco one last Session but this could not be carried out owing to the necessity for cutting down the programme of legislation to a minimum,   I consider, however, that there is a strong case for bringing in the Bill, if approved by the Cabinet, at an early date next Session and for pushing on with it as rapidly as circumstances permit.(Initialled) &apos; S, B.19,11c21,
