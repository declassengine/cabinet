THIS DOCOMErg IS THE H^OPBRTY OF HIS STANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOTONCT. RET I  M.H.41.*3427, NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE.MEMORANDUM   BY   THE    MINISTER   OB&apos;   HEALTH.Owing to the present abnormal conditions a considerable number of insured persons are about to complete 12 months of unemployment and their- Health Insurance is consequently coming to an. end j their membership of their approved societies being terminated.     ^n return to employment such persons will be treated as If they had not previously been insured, and will be subject to waiting periods and to reduced benefits for the first two years.     Representations have been received from approved societies and other representative bodies as to the hardship which will &quot;be caused in such cases, and I there fore desire,at once to introduce a short emergency measure to preserve the health insurance rights of the persons in question, It is also intended to make pro vis ion by regulations to secure for them the maintenance of medical benefit, and their right-to the minimum cash benefits notwithstanding the arrears in their contributions .My proposals will not involve any expense to the Exchequer as the cost will fall on the funds of the approved societies.     Tho Government Actuary Is satisfied that having regard to the results of the recent valuation, and to the subsequent favourable sickness experience the societies are able to shoulder the additional burden.Steps are being taken to bring the proposals to the notice of approved societies, and it Is hoped that their concurrence will be secured and that the proposed Bill will be non-controversial*     In fact the adoption of seme proposal, of the kind has been pressed upon me in the last few days by the Committee of the. National -Conference of Friendly Societies.Ministry of Health. At MOND.20th October, 1921.
