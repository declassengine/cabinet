QMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Executive Committee of the. Miners&apos;  Federation of Great Britain met me on October 19th and made an appeal that the sum of approximately  3,000,000, by which the actual expenditure upon the subvention of wages in the coal mining industry under the agreement of 1st July last ha3 fallen short of the maximum of  10,000,000 authorised by the House of Commons, should be devoted to the assistance of the coal mining industry.Mr. Hodgps, who presented their case, made in effect three alternative suggestions as to the manner in which this sum should be used.His first request was that it should be used to improve the wages of the workers in the industry on the same lines as those which have been followed during July, August and September, viz. , that the Government should make such, additions to the wages payable under the operation of the agreement as were necessary in any district to bring them up to an agreed minimum rate.    The grounds upon which this appeal was based were shortly stated in his letter of 28th September to the Prime Minister.    Copies of this letter and of the Prime Minister&apos;s reply are attached.Since the date of Mr.  Hodges&apos; letter the situation has been relieved for October by an award of the Independent Chairman of the National Board on a disputed point regarding the liability of the owners to assist wages in October out of past profits.    But in South Wales, which is the district chiefly concerned, the men have suffered a further reduction averaging about 2/6 per day
as compared with September v 5/6 as compared with March). In November and December the situation is bound to be worse, and wages in South Wales during these months may well fall right down to the minimum provided by the agreement - that is to say a reduction, on the average, of about 9/- per day as compared with March last. This would leave an average wage of about 9/6 per day which is not much more than 20fo above pre-war earnings.But even Mr. Hodges could seek to justify such an expenditure of public funds only by contemplating that;-/-i&apos;V-.-at the end of it either trade would have, revived or that the Government would have found &quot;some other broader and more general policy to deal with the industry&quot;.    This Is practically an admission that the proposal is merely one to postpone the evil day in the hope that something will turn up.   I do not think we could possibly go to the House of Commons with such a proposal.   Admittedly it could do nothing to Improve the coal trade, nothing to reduce prices, nothing to widen the area of employment.   No doubt if the wages in South Wales come down to the minimum before the end of the. year there will be a great outcry and strong pressure- will be brought upon the Government to do   something.   No doubt too, with the cost of living at anything like its present figure, that wage 7/111 be a very meagre one.    It will however be the wage which, under their own agreement with the owners, the men have admitted to be as high as the industry can afford to pay, and there is provision for a special adjustment of the wages of the lowest paid&apos;workers in the event of their falling below a fair subsistence level.Mr. Hodges&apos; next alternative was to use the  3,000,000, to assist owners who cannot otherwise afford to keep their pits open at the current district wages, and thereby to reduce the number of men without employment.
This scheme would be open to all the main objections for which the Miners&apos; national pooling system was condemned. In particular it would mean the subsidising of inefficient pits,    bo long aa there is not sufficient market to enable even those pits which can produce at a profit to work full time, it is obviously uneconomic to subsidise those pits which cannot produce at a profit.The last alternative was to use the money ae a subsidy to the industry to enable colliery owners to sell below the cost of production and so to secure a reduction in the price of coal and stimulate trade.The stagnation of the coal industry is part of the stagnation of the whole industrial life of the country at the present time, and the only remedy lies in asa improvement in trade conditions and an Increase in the demand for coal.   No assistance to wages and no assistance to colliery oVners&apos;  finances which does not by some means reduce the price of coal can affect the demand for coal under present conditions,        Mr. Hodges1 suggestion to secure a reduction in coal prices has more to recommend it at first sight than has either of his other suggestions. Upon examination, however, I am satisfied that no scheme of this kind- can be adopted.    The price of coal is already falling by reason of the fact that the supply exceeds the demand.    As long as this condition continues the price will continue to fall.     To attempt to stimulate the fall artificially would do more harm than good.    It would be impossible to ensure that such a subsidy was devoted to reduction of price and not to increase of profit, except by a reimposition of rigorous control over price, with all the consequential governmental interference from which the industry has just been freed.   Even if the practical difficulties could be overcome, the State would ha-ve to undertake an enormous financial liability to make any such scheme effective.     3,000,000 would go a very little way,
&apos;My view the reform is that the miners must be in formed, that the whole of the available resources of the State at the present time, must be devoted to the financing of the schemes outlined by&apos;the Prime Minister on October 19 th for the restoration of trade generally, and the relief of unemployment generally,, and that it is Impossible to make a further grant for the special assistance of the c oalminin g in dustry*It must, he remembered that this  3,000,000 has not been voted by the House of Commons.    Under the proposal which was rejected by tho miners on their ballot vote a suyi of  10,000,000 would have been voted to the industry.   Under the proposal eventually accepted only such amount of money was voted (subject to a maximum of  10*000,000) as was necessary to bridge the gap in wages during the three months,   A new vote would therefore be required for any further.assistance to the industry.(Initialled) - S.

Copy.THE MINERS&apos; FEDERATION OP GREAT BRITAIN,55, Russell Square,London. W.C. 1.28th September, 1021.The Rt, lion. David Lloyd George, i,P., 10, Downing street, S* W. 1*Dear Prime Mihiator,1 am instructed by ay 3xooutivo Committoo to bring to your notISo the following situation in the Mining Industry.As you are probably aware, there will be a substantial unexpendod balance of tho Government&apos;a subvention on tho 30th September next.   This balance is principally duo to tho operation of the Agreement itself, and tho state of trado through which tho industry has passed during the past three months   tho Owners profits having materially assisted in reducing the amount of the subvention, and tho shortage of working days owing toiflack of trade has also contributed to some extent.The position, howevor, is, as wo indicated it would bo when wo discussed the Government subvention with you at our last meetings before tho -signing of the Agreement.   We strongly urged upon you the view, that the whole of the subvention would not be used up if we had reductions of 2/-, 2/0d., and 3/- respectively for the months of July, August and September.   You on the other hand, stated quite, omphatically, that you woro of opinion tho money would bo expended before the end of the temporary.period, and your fear was that the miners would regard any oxtra&apos; reduction in September as a breach of a bargain.The situation in many of. our districts, for October, is i serious in the extreme, as in addition to the 18,/- per weok which we havo experienced in most districts for the month of September, a further reduction of anything from 20/- to 30/- per week will take place in some of our districts.    If   tho workmen
have to suffer these additional reductions, their wages will be well below the poverty line, and my Executive urge that the Government should at once take into consideration the full facts of the situation, and agree that the unexpended balance of £3,000,000 be used to mitigate the great wage fall which would be inevitable in October and November.

We feel confident that this appeal will not fall upon deaf ears, and that if the Government agree to this course, we have no doubt but that the House of Commons will fully endorse their attitude, as the House itself were certainly of opinion that the whole of the £10,000,000 would be expended. As the House of Commons, however, does not reassemble until the 18th October, and the effect of the wage reduction will be felt in the first pay in October, we would urge that the Government sanction a Treasury advance until such time as they deem it necessary, if it be necessary, to secure the final consent of Parliament.

My Committee further urge in view of the gravity of the situation that you should receive a deputation at the very earliest date, and would be glad to hear from you when it would be convenient for us to meet you so that we could lay in detail the full facts of the situation before you.

I beg to remain,

Yours very truly,

(signed)

FRANK HODGES.

Dear Mr. Hodges,

In further reference to your letter of the 28th September, at the end of which you say that you wish to have an opportunity of explaining the full facts of the situation orally by deputation, I have no doubt that the


President of the Board of Trade, in whose province the matter lies, will, if you will get in touch with him, make an appointment to meet you and will report in due course to the Cabinet. I understand that, since your letter was written, a ruling has been given by the Independent Chairman of the National Board which is likely to relieve your wages situation for October.

Meantime I do not wish to say anything which might appear to prejudge the matter. But I confess I received your letter with surprise, and, while I do not at present make any other comments, I must remind you that, while I certainly expressed the opinion that the limit of £10,000,000 was likely to be reached before the end of the temporary period, the possibility of the whole sum not being spent was clearly contemplated from the outset. I stated definitely, both at the Board of Trade and in the House of Commons that if the full maximum amount was not spent, the benefit would got to the Exchequer. This was the essential difference between the terms of settlement and the offer that was put to the ballot and rejected.

Yours faithfully,

(signed) D. Lloyd-George.
