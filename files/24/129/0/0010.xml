EXPLOITATION   OF   THE   UNEMPLOYED   BY FOREIGN     COMMUNISMS.It is now certain that the organisation of the Unemployed by Communist Agitators is inspired end paid for from abroad and that there is a Bettled plan to induce the Unemployed to make demands upon the local Authorities, and through them upon the Exchequer, which will smash the financial machine and so bring revolution appreciably nearer.THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OP THE RUSSIAN THADING delegation in April, 1921, certain arrangements were made for keeping watch upon the banking accounts controlled by Krassin and the members of his Trading Delegation.    It soon became apparent that there were many transactions of a very dubious nature, but it was not easy to say whether the motive was to rob the Soviet Government or to provide secret funds for propaganda in the United Kingdom.Klishko, the secretary to the Delegation, was found to havecontrol over no less than seven banking accounts, and on toy 3rd hehad absolute personal control of no less than  1,650,000.   Thebanking accounts are as follows:(a) London Joint City &amp; Midland Bank......fb) London Joint City &amp; Midland Bank......(o) Guaranty Trust Company of New York ....(d) Guaranty Trust Company of Now York ....(e) Guaranty Trust Company of New &quot;York ....(f) Guaranty Trust Company of New York ....(g) Lloyd&apos;s Bank, 16, St. James&apos;s St.....Out of (b) Klishko pays the salaries of the personnel, and certain dependents of the Delegation, such as AndrewRoth stein/Deposit Account Current Account Deposit Account Current Sterling Account Personal CurrentSterling Account. Dollar Account Current Account
- 2 - - - -Rothstoin, the British horn son of Theodore Rothstein.   Itwas noticed in May that he was in the habit of drawing outconsiderable sums in notes of small denomination.The next most interesting of hi3 accounts is (e), the personal sterling account in the Guaranty Trust Company.In March and April this account received large creditsfrom one S.R. Rabinoff, of Pall Mall, drawn upon theAmerican Express Company.   Rabinoff and his brother Max areshady financiers with headquarters at Reval.   They livesometimes in this country and sometimes in the United Statesand both have been denounced as agents of the SovietGovernment.   Rabinoff was found to be paying nearly  25,000a week into KLishkoTs account, and further investigationshowed that Rabinoff was obtaining gold from the soviet delegation at Reval, was having it stamped in Stockholmwith the Mint mark and transferring it to himself inAmerica, where it was sold 6uid the proceeds paid into theAmerican Express Company and eventually transferred toZlishko^ account after Rabinoff had retained for himselfa heavy commission.   Between June 2nd and June 21st aseries of very curious transactions on this account wasdisclosed.   line bearer cheques, amounting in all to 51,210, were cashed by Rabinoff in English notes from  5to  1,000.   , On June 21st a chqque for  60,000 was clearedand drawn in English notes from 10s. Od. to  500.   Itwas then stated that the money was required to go throughthe Mediterranean to South Russia.   Steps were taken to trace the notes and it was found tluvt most of them went tomoney changers who supplied French currency.   About this time ICLishko began to suspect that his accounts were being examined and his habit of drawing bearer cheques which werecashed by Rabinoff increased.   It is characteristic ofRabinoffs transactions that only last week he brought 1,000 in Bank of England notes to the Guaranty Trust Co.and asked for 1,000 old Treasury Hotes in exchange - nodoubt /
doubt, in order that tracing may be increasingly difficult. On June 4th Erassin, in communicating with Tchitcherine, used the phrase, &quot;I once more request you to inform me urgently in notes of what denomination you wish me to send English and French currency.   Bear in mind that the English currency will all be marked, i.e. before giving us the notes the Bank will take their numbers.&quot;   Prom this and other communications it became certain that   in order to avoid the scandal of money being traced from the Trading Delegation into the hands of the English Communists, French and English currencies were being transmitted by the official courier to Russia with the intention of re-transmitting it to Commtinists in England direct fro-;1, one of the Soviet agencies abroad.    It was further evident that Klishko, who we know from Other sources is representative of the Extraordinary Commission (Tche-Ka.) in England, was secretly disbursing money and that he was concerned not to disclosed to Krassin what he was doing.On June 21st there left in the &quot;Baltannic&quot; Peter Miller, Cypher Clerk at the Delegation, Jules Orosjean, an official Soviet courier, Tom Mann, President of the Red Trade Union International, Harry Pollitt and John Strain, both members of the International.   Two days later ICLishko telegraphed to Tchitcherine that the couriers, Miller and Orosjean &quot;are bringing you  60,000 of English currency and 2,360,000 French francs.   Please sena the receipt for this money by Miller on his return.&quot; It will be seen that the amounts of British and French currency respectively correspond with the  60,000, and, after a deduction of commission&apos; for Eabinoff, with the 2,900,000 francs, the equivalent of the  51,210 drawn by Rabinoff and exchanged into French notes.It/
It is obvious that this money was intended for distribution to the delegates from different countries to the Congress of the Third International to which Tom Mann and his companions were proceeding.   That is why Krassin gave his warning about the numbers of the British notes being recorded by Banks.   French notes are virtually untraceable.The process of subsidising.Communists is now fairly clear.   It is as follows:Soviet gold is sold to Swedish Banks, which have it refined in the Swedish Mint at a charge of 7 per cent.   The gold, now bearing the Swedish stamp, is sold in America and the proceeds are credited to Klishko, who withdraws it through an intermediary by means of bearer cheques and transmits the cash by the official courier to the Soviet Government, which transmits it to England in the manner described below.Mr. Leslie Urquhart, who has just returned from Moscow, ascertained that practicedly no money was now being spent except  .upon propaganda.   There is documentary evidence to show that Theodore Eothstein gave Albert Inkpin  300 for the expenses of the delegates to Moscow.   The German Communist, ELara Zetkin, defrayed the expenses of delegates to the Women&quot;s Communist International in July this year. Pollitt and Ellen Wilkinson were given letters of.credit for  500 when they went to the Red Trade Union International and all the English delegates had their expenses first class paid.   The British Bureau also offered to pay the expenses of two delegates of the South Wales Miners1 Federation to the Moscow Congress.   In 1920 a Norwegian named Zaohariasson brought  300 to Sylvia Pankhurst.The/
The exposure of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; subsidy of  75,000 resulting from the sale of Russian   Jewels will be remembered.   About the same time Rothstein was subsidising the &quot;Call&quot; at the rate of  25 a week.   He paid  500 for the use of the Albert Hall for a pro-Bolshevik meeting.   There is also evidence tct show that  3,000 which had been promised to Sylvia Pankhurst was appropriated by the United Communist Party at Maiden lane. In January, 1921,  4,000 was brought over for the expenses of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International.   In January, 1921. a Norwegian named Prljs paid  1,000 for the formation of a Communist Party of Great Britain, and In March, 1921, the Executive of the Red Trade Union International allocated  50,000 for propaganda in all countries.   In May, .1921, Moscow assigned 200,000 gold   roubles to the Communist Party for the use of the British Miners.     This was actually reported by the Vienna correspondent of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on May 28th,   On June 27th   Krassin, telegraphing to Rosovsky in Moscow, expressed dissatisfaction that no one in England knew officially that the All Russia Congress of Trade Unions had assigned this sum.     It is not quite certain whether this money was actually received.A SUBSIDY FOR THE MINERS&apos; STRIKEAbout one transaction there can be no doubt p/whatever.   The firm of John Lawrie &amp; Co., of YJalker Lane, Torry, Aberdeen, and 40, Shaftesbury Avenue, London, formerly dealers in scrap metal but latterly in electrical applicances, acts as oover in the financing from Russian sources of the Red Trade Union International, whose principal officials are Albert Edward Booth, George Peet and Edward Lismer, born in Sheffield.   The partners consist of John Lawrie, Arthur Fraser Macintosh and Anton Beratz, believed to be a Czecho-Slovak, and John Westermark, Lawrie&apos;s son-in-law.- The firm banks with the North of Scotland Bank in Aberdeen and lloyd in FenchurchStreet/
Street.   On examination of the hanking accounts of this firm it was found that cheques were cashed in Aberdeen and notes taken in payment, of which the numbers were not recorded, lawrie had, however, drawn a cheque for  2,500, dated April 19th, in favour of W.S. Unkles, and a cheque for  850 in favour of one   Fletcher, at the Yorkshire Penny Bank, Attercliffe, Leeds.   On the afternoon of the 15th April tinkles came to the Union Bank of Scotland with John Lawrie and requested the Manager to cash the cheque for  2,500, Unklos guaranteeing Lawrie1s identity and Lawrie   producing his pass-book showing   a considerable credit balance.   After a little difficulty the cheque was cashed on Monday, the 18th April, in  100 notes of the Union Bank of Scotland. Unkles mentioned that the notes were going to Sheffield, An examination was then made of the account of George Peet, of the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International in Manchester and here was found a credit payment in  100 notes identical with those issued by the Union Bank of Scotland.   The cheque for  850 drawn on May 17th in favour of Fletcher was paid out by the bank at Afrtercliffe to George Henry Fletcher of 67, Crimicar Lane, Sheffield, a prominent local Cpmmunist who was convicted on the 9th June for a revolutionary speech.   In February last this man had attempted to g* to Russia via Germany, but he could not obtain a visa from the Germans and so did not go.   He cashed tho cheque for  850 in two suras,  100 on May 9th in  1 Treasury Notes, and 10  5 Bank of England notes and  750 in  1 Treasury Notes on May 18th.   When cashing the cheque he told the Bank clerk, in the presence of the Manager, that the money was required for Miners&apos; strike pay.On the 15th June it was ascertained that Lloyd&amp;s Bank had issued certain Bank Notes to Lawrie &amp; Co.   Among these was a  5 Bank of England Note No. A25/17414 and on the 27th June this note turned up in the head branch of the SheffieldBanking /
Banking Company, George Street, Sheffield.   It was traced&quot; &quot; to the Drapery Department of a Co-operative Store in   -Pagewell Road, Sheffield, and &quot;bore what proved to be a member&apos;s trading number in that Society, 10344.   This number belonged to Elizabeth Ann Booth, the wife of Albert Edward Booth, financial organiser of the Red Trade Union International.More recently three additional lots of Bank. Ho teg paid out to John Lawrie &amp; Co. were traced into the hands of E, lisrner, the Organising Secretary of the Red Trade Union International, who paid them to the Vfeyfarers&apos; Travel Agency to furnish letters of credit to Pollitt and the other members of the Red Trade Union International who . were going to Moscow.Three distinct financial transactions have therefore been traced between John Lawrie &amp; Co., and the officials of the Red Trade Union International.The credit side of John Lawrie&apos;:3 account was equally interesting.   Most of the money paid in up to May 17th was in dollar notes, 10,000 of which were paid in shortly after John Murphy had returned from Russia via Berlin and the Red Trade Union International had been formed in this country.   A further sum of 15, 60 dollars was paid in on April 19th.   It must be remembered that dollar notes aro untraeeable and pass from hand to hand until they fall to pieces.   A cheque for  5,000 on the Swiss Banking Corporation, London, B.C., has been received from Corsch, Simon &amp; Co., Mohrenstrasse, Berlin.   This payment for a time was untraceable and the enquiry had therefore to be transferred to Berlin.   The correspondence conducted by Anton Berats, a partner of L!-v/rie&apos;s firm, showed a close connection with one Priedrich Peyerherd, whose shop in the Mauerstrasse for dealing in stovesand/
and electric fittings was found to have no customers hut to he a cover for propaganda and courier activity.   It was found that Anton Beratz, under the name of Sturm, had he en closely associated with Eoyerherd, hut that they quarrelled.   The Eeyerherd family consisted of the father, two sons and two daughters.   Earl, the father, v;as found to be a courier in the employ of the German United Communist Party, and in that capacity he has close connection with the Soviet Mission in Berlin and the Third International in Moscow.   Intercepted communications have proved that Macintosh, a partner, and Ian Macpherson, a friend of the Lawries, are also in relation with the Eeyerherds and journey frequently to and from Berlin.   later correspondence established the fact that imton Beratz was intended to come to England to replace Eachers.   Now Fachcrs has been known far some time as the principal organiser of the Red Trade Union International in Great Britain.   According to the intercepted letters he was blamed for making mistakes and Beratz was expected to do better, though, like Eachers, he intended to begin operations in Cardiff and gradually spread through Plymouth, Bristol and Exeter. There were indications in the letters that Beratz is also engaged in the transmission of literature to Ireland. Beratz has not yet arrived.   If he comes it is intended to arrest him for carrying a false passport.   Before the expiration of the Defence of the Realm Act John Iawriels premises were searched and the partners interviewed. Their courage evaporated and each tried to shift on to the other the blame for their association with Beratz. It is thus clear that, funds are being sent through apparently legitimate business firms through Berlin to the Communists.The/
The tracing of these transactions has entailed a great deal of patience and labour.   Many hundred notes have been traced from hand to hand by personal interviews and of course, since few people record the numbers of the notes they receive, the trail ia perhaps 90 per cent of the cases was lost.   Therefore it must be borne in mind that any case where the chain is complete is only one example of what is believed to be an extensive practice.Introduction of Bolshevik LiteratureIn addition to money, other forms of propaganda have not been neglected.   A series of letters intercepted betweenVDecember, 1920, and August, 1921, indicate that there is awell organised system for introducing Bolshevik literatureinto the country through Seamen&quot; s organisations both here and abroad, and in particular the Deutsche Schiffahrtsound,whose President, Otto Bieger, is the representative of theThird International in Hamburg.   Two letters intercepted ontheir way from this country show that Fachers, who goesunder the name of &quot;Johnny Walker&quot;, Is the Third Internationalrepresentative in the United Kingdom and that it is he whois organising and distributing the propaganda literature.Stations have been established at South Shields, Hull,Grimsby and Cardiff,   It will be remembered that Mr, HavelockWilson&apos;s Union is now menaced by a body of seceders callingthemselves the &quot;Seamen&apos;s Vigilance Committees&quot; composed ofCommunists.   A conversation with Dick Beech, a Communistseaman, showed that he was very proud of the work he wasaccomplishing, particularly in corrupting Eaval stokers.He hinted darkly at the possibility of His Majesty&apos;s Shipsbeing held up by some clandestine act of sabotage on thepart of Communists among the stokers.   Beech is an-adept in arranging for stowaways.   He acts as liaison betweenJ. Latimer alias Fr. Bergmann alias Georg Neumann, a Lett,Chief Agent of the Third International for Germany and scandinavia/
Scandinavia, and Paoners.   The control at the ports in this country has been perceptibly weakened by the lapse of the Defence of the Realm Act and in only one instance has it been possible to frustrate one of these transactions. On December 10th, 1020, a Norwegian named Anker Petterson was arrested in South Shields for being in possession of revolutionary literature.   He landed at night on the quay, where he v/as met by John Davidson Bell and Basil Scott, who are knawn to be working under the instructions of Teachers.   His parcels contained Soviet propaganda literature of the most extreme kind,   further enquiry showed that this had been handed to him in Christiania by a representative of the Seamen&apos;s Union just before the sos. &quot;Stirling&quot; sailed for the United Kingdom.   Prom statements which he ms.de on arrest, it was gathered that he had been in the habit for some time of carrying such parcels.On October 25th last year &amp; Bolshevik courier named Veltheim, for whom search had been active for some months, v/as arrested as he came out of Major Malone&apos;s flat.   He was found to be in possession of important documents for Russia which threw light on the Communist movement in this country.   The most interesting was a manual entitled the &quot;Red Officers&apos; Course&quot;, which contained seven lectures for cadet3 of the British Red Army, which v/as already being enrolled by Jack Tanner.   It was proved that these manuals were reproduced from a stencil cut on Malone&apos;s typewriter. Other documents showed that Russian money had been allocated for Sinn Fein, that  300 had been spent on propaganda for the Dower Deck and that Tanner had recently received  70 for &quot;Solidarity&quot;.   Veltheim, who was well known in Finland for his revolutionary activities, was  1 sentenced to six months and deportation.RUSSIAN/
RUSSIAN INSPIRATION  -OR iaHGLISH COMMUNISTS.Soon after the Third International was founded the conditions of admission binding upon all Communists, now known as the tventy-one points, were laid down in Moscow. They are too long to quote, but the effect is that all propaganda and agitation must correspond with the decisions of the Third International;   that Communists must create &quot;unlawful organisations&quot; which at the decisive moment will help the party to &quot;fulfil its duty tovsards the Revolution&quot;; that there must he a systematic and energetic propaganda in the Army;   that every 3ranch must break entirely with the &quot;Centre&quot; party (Mr. Ramsay Macdonald is cited as a typical &quot;centre&quot; man);    that agitation must extend to the Colonies and particularly to the Colonial Troops;   must hinder the transport of munitions of war;   must expel all luke-warm members and must bring about the Dictatorship of the Communists.In June, 1920, the Red Trade Union International. (R.T.UeIo) was formed in Moscow at a Conference attended hy Robert Williams and A. a. Pureell, with Sinovieff in the chair.   It was then decided to carry on continuous propaganda and mass revolutionary action to destroy the Capitalist system in the Bourgeois state;   to fight class co-operation, which is weakening the labour movement, to organise the collection of funds for the support of strikes and great eocial conflicts, and generally to foster the decay of Trade Unions from Y/ithin.   Intercepted correspondence shows thie conclusively.The Soviet Government had not turned to this expedient until their hopes had been dashed in another direction.   While Kameneff was still one of their principal emissaries in London, the Councils of Action were formed, and there is a very interesting aeriee of intercepted cypher messages from ^lomcneff to Tehitcherine, beginningon/
on the 12th August, 1920, and ending on the 9th September,. 1920, in which the results of Conferences between Eameneff and the Council of Action are set out.   On the night of August 12th Esmeheff recounts that Bob Williams and two members of the Council of Action came to see him and said, &quot;The whole movement is in our hands.   We will not let George move a finger.   Wo will squeeze Prance. We will stop the supply of coal if the published conditions (re Poland) remain unchanged.....&quot;    Even Mr, Thomas had joined the Council of Action and local Councils were set up all over the country.   But the anticipations even of Comunists are not immune from the fallibility of all human hopes and in less then three months the Councils were being derisively styled in Labour circles, &quot;Councils of Inaction.&quot;   They are now forgotten.An attempt was also made at this time to capture the Co-operatives of thio country.   By decree of the Soviet Government in March, 1920, all Russian Co-operative Societies were taken over and a circular letter was written on May 26th, 1921, inviting representatives to attend a special Conference in Moscow with the view of bringing about an International Co-operative movement pledged to the World Revolution. All expenses were to be defrayed by the Authorities in Moscow.   The invitation was sent through the International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions, but the British Bureau, finding it impossible to comply, appointed Ellen Wilkinson and Tom Mann to attend the Conference, There can be no doubt that this was, if not a technical, an actual breach of the conditions of the Trading Agreement.USE/
USE OF MONEY.Since its formation the membership of the Communist Party of Great Britain has fluctuated between 5,000 -6.000.   At present 50 per oent of these members are unemployed and consequently pay no subscriptions.   The income of the party from this source is under  40 per week, as only 3d per week per member is paid to headquarters.   Against this stun must be set salaries which amount weekly to  132. 5. Od (receipts for these salaries have in most cases passed through this department).   To these must be added the cost oi&apos; advertisements in the &quot;Herald&quot;, conferences, meetings, fares, extra speakers&apos; expenses, headquarters, office expenses and literature, some of which is sold at less than the cost of production and much of which is given away.   The only other legitimat assets appear to be 50 per cent of collections which is sent to headquarters and any profit made on the &quot;Communist or small pamphlets,Sylvia Pankhurst wrote in the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; of September 24th that &quot;The Gommunist&quot; was &quot;heavily-subsidised, largely advertised and sold at 4d a quire cheaper to newsagents and branches&quot; than her own paper, Zinovieff also informed J, J. Vaughan in Moscow recently that the Communist Party v/ould get no more money until they produced a better propaganda paper.Extraordinary expenses of the Party this year include the sum of  1,000 to the International Socialist Club and  968   12s. 5d for the Caerphilly Election.The British Bureau of the.Red Trade UnionInternational was run on Russian money from its inception:the initial sum received from Russia was  4,000 but this sum/
sum must have been supplemented subsequently, as documents relating to transactions amounting to thousands of pounds were eeized in Manchester when George Peet was arrested.The eleven district organisers were paid  5 to  6 per week from February to September of this year:   &quot;solidarity&quot; was subsidised at the rate of over  90 a week for several months, while some form of subsidy was arranged for the &quot;Worker&quot; when &quot;solidarity&quot; ceased publication and the expenses of all local secretaries and travelling speakers were paid from headquarters, offices were maintained in Manchester and London, large quantities of literature were distributed gratis and the cost of numerous conferences was defrayed.At the beginning of September instructions were sent from Moscow that no further money would be forthcoming after September 30th and the whole organisation has temporarily broken down, providing striking proof of the dependence of revolutionary activity in this country on foreign subsidy.MOSCOW AIL THE UNEMPLOYED.It was not until February, 1921, that the Soviet Authorities first saw the potentialities of unemployment. In that month they issued to the West European Secretariat a set of instructions directing that special attention be paid to the formation of organisations affiliated to the International Union of Unemployed.   One of the theses of the Congress held in Moscow in June and July last was the following:&quot;By uniting the Unemployed with the proletarian Vanguards in the struggle- for the Social Bevo?-ution, the Communist Party will restrain the most rebellious and impatientelements/
&quot;elements among the unemployed, from individual desperate acts and enable the entire mass to actively support under favourable circumstances the struggle ofthe proletariat............In a word, this  .entire mass from a reserve army of industry will be transformed into an active army of the devolution&quot;.In August there came into our hande instructions issued from Moscow to the Norwegian Secretariat of the young Com-munist International in which the following passages oo-curred:&quot;(1)   Doles are to be demanded on a scale equalling the weekly wage of the industry.(2)   Aa municipalities are more likely to yield to such demands, the first attacks of this kind ehould be directed againstmunicipalities.    Every kind of such ac-tivities must be directed in a way as to exclude any possibility of tracting them back to general scheme.     The demands of the workers should appear to be local de-mands, having no apparent connection with similar attempts in the same country.&quot;The underlying object of these instructions is:(a) To camouflage the subversive activity of the Communist Youth International.(b) To weaken municipal finance in order to compel the municipalities to apply to the respective Governments for assistance.(c) To convince the workers that it pays to be an unemployed loyal comrade.(d) To compel the various Governments by pressure of Parliament and public opinion either to provide for an unemployment bonus on a scale which is intolerable for the public purse, or to control both industries and technical trades by a body of members elected by the Labour organisations.It was at this time that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; which,since it was subsidised by the Russians, (though it pro-feesed to have declined the subsidy the money was neverrepaid) has always acted as the organ of the -SovietGovernment, launched its cry of &quot;Go to the Guardians&quot;.A careful perusal of its articles on the unemployed leaveno/
no doubt that the Russian scheme of smashing the financial ambitions of the Local Authorities was the policy of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;; hence the widely advertised &quot;Martyrdom&quot; of the Poplar Guardians and the threat of a &quot;Ho Rent&quot; strike as a lever to obtain their release from Brixton and Holloway Prisons.     The results of the scheme have been a little dis-appointing to its promoters, who are now rating their sup-porters for their inaction.On April 22nd &quot;Solidarity&quot;, a paper subsidised from Russia, issued an appeal signed by the Soviet Transport Workers to the Marine Transport Workers of the World to adopt revolutionary tactics and set up Ship Committees.&quot;Solidarity&quot; was forced to cease publication owing to lack of funds when the subsidy from the British Bureau of the Red Trade Union International was withdrawn and has not been able to resume publication.In May last there was issued from Moscow a series of radio messages addressed to various Trade Unions in the hope of influencing the Triple Alliance to strike in sympathy with the miners.     The later messages upbraid the Railwaymen and the Transport Yiorkers for their &quot;treason&quot;.In the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of June 29th Arlsberg, the Russian correspondent, quotes part of a speech from Trotsky on the world economic situation.     According to him, Trotsky said, &quot;We Communists must benefit by every respite In our struggle in order to increase class dissensions&quot;.     Theso words were re-ceived with tumultuous applause.     The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; adds that a representative of India spoke on   the importance of revolutionary mass action in the British Dependencies.The/
The &quot;Daily Heraia&quot; of the 2nd September printed a manifesto to the reoent Trade Union Congress signed by Zinovieff, Rosovsky and McManus.     This was printed as a full page advertisement.     Apart from the familiar and rather wearisome abuse of Capitalist States, it called for the creation of a &quot;General Staff&quot;, but since it denounced Mr. Thomas and other leaders it was not likely to create much sensation.THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL OP YOUTH.The Communist International of Youth has its headquarters in Berlin.     The week ending September 3rd was set apart forspecial propaganda and it was decided to hold an international conference in London on September 4th.     In its manifestooccurs the following passage:&quot;We expect that all organisations affiliated with us will do their utmost in preparing the Day, which is to be a black day for the bourgeoisie.     Therefore, young Comrades, get busy.&quot;In September a fresh manifesto was issued calling attention to the fact that the week which will end on the 9th October is a special propaganda week for the Communist International. Every member was to work hard to increase the membership and to mobilise all its forces for the week.A very curious document was issued by Reuter on the 30th September, signed by Zinovieff and eight other members of the International,     It begins by saying that the Soviet Govern-raent has been compelled by circumstances to modify its pro-gramme and consent to concessions to Capitalists and adds that the Third International has renounced direct action until the Soviet Government has coped with its difficulties, but it goes on to say that this does not mean a renunciation of organizing work.     &quot;The Thira International had made all the concessions/
concessions it oould make, but will not yield another inch of its position.     3he truce is to be used for cleansing the Communist Patties of their unworthy elements.LORD CUBZOtPS NOTE.As was to be expected, the Soviet Government met thecharges in Lord Curzonfs note by a flat denial and they arenow circulating reports that the charges are based on forgedaoonraents fabricated in Berlin.     nevertheless, in the moscow Wireless of September 26th there is a message to the&quot;Working Class of England&quot; which contains this passage:&quot;Of course the Communist International has not the mission of doing things that are pleasant to the British Imperialist Government; just the reverse. What the Communist International really does or will do will never earn the applause of the British, the French or any other Government, but will earn the ap-plause of the working class of the whole world.&quot;THE SITUATION IS THE UNITED KINGDOM.The pz^ceedinge of the agitators of the unemployed show how minutely the instructions formulated in Moscow have been followed, even to the suggestion that local prejudices are to be respected in countries that are prejudiced against Russia, and that applications to the Guardians should appear to be local demands not based upon any central scheme. While some of the agitators have advocated violence and the &quot;demonstrations&quot; in various parts of the country have been riotous, the more sober and the more dangerous speak-ers are careful to warn their followers against looting. Those speakers who have failed to obey that injunction are persons who have criminal records, such as William Pullen, who has haa seven convictions for larceny, burglary, gambling, obscene language, etc.-, and Charles French, alias &quot;Cockney Charlie&quot;, who has had no less than fourteen eon-viotions/
victlons, inoluding two terms of penal servitude for theftand other offences.     There has &quot;been a slight falling offin the attendance at meetings and demonstrations, but the communists have now fixed October 13th for the simultaneousdemonstration all over the country.     In a letter fromA.Newrie, of the Ctsmberwell unemployed, to W.H^nnington atthe Head Office, the objeot is explained:&quot;I do not know what you think, but I can see some serious trouole ahead.    There is likely to be conflicts in all Boroughs shortly which tho boys in blue and usa     DouTt you think there ought to be a great International move one 3ay by all Boroughs so that the Police cannot all concentrate to one spot?&quot;The agitators of the unemployed are all Communists.The national Administrative Council an6 the london DistrictCouncil are the two central bodies; the latter is dominated by Cant, the London District Organiser of the Communist Party,who has his headquarters at the International Socialist Club,where he conducts classes for unemployed speakers.   ThirtyCommittees have been formed in London and provincial Com-mittees affiliated to the Central council are being formed in most industrial centres ancl will put forward uniformdemands to the Guardians for an extortionate rate of main-tenance.     Members of the Provincial&apos;Committees are in most cases Communists and many have had oonviotions for seditiousspeeches.     George Wheeler, for example, the North EasternOrganiser of the Unemployed, who is at present on remand atSuaderland for Incitement to violence, boasted last v/eekthat he was acting on the orders of the Third international and was in receipt of  5 a week.     The looting of a shop inNewington Causeway can be directly traced to a suggestion made by Panning, the leader of the C*iaberwell Unemployed.The looting in Dundee which resulted in damage valued at      jfrom/
- so -from  2,000 to  4,000 was also due to incitement by hooligan leaders.REVOLUTIONARY LITERATURE.The output of propaganda literature from Russia is astounding.     Almost every day copies of the &quot;Rosta Wien&quot;, the &quot;Bulletins&quot;, the &quot;Young Communist International&quot; ana a variety of leaflets addressed to prominent Communists in the United Kingdom are intercepted in the post.     The organs of nearly all the Communist Parties of Western Europe are re-ceived by the headquarters of the Communist Party of Great Britain in london.     Large packets of Bolshevik pamphlets are frequently found by the Custom Authorities, coming some-times via Berlin and sometimes from Scandinavia.     The chief agency for forwarding such literature in Germany is that of Carl Hoym, Hamburg.     In many cases the literature bears the stamp of the Soviet printing organisations.     The pamphlets and periodicals are all of the familiar type and some of them are printed in English.     Prom time to time the Trading Delegation has received consignments&apos;of books.     Some are sent to the British Museum and some they supplied to the Foreign Department at Mudies who, without examining them, accepted for circulation books preaching violent class war.
