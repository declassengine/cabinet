G.P. 104 (24).AIRSHIP DEVELOPMENT.memorandum by the secretary of state for air.AT their meeting on Friday, the 8th February, the Cabinet requested me to prepare a memorandum amplifying my remarks on the subject of the Burney scheme and my alternative proposals for the development of airships.2. In the first place, I would emphasise that I find universal agreement that it is necessary, alike on commercial and military grounds, to proceed with the develop-ment of airships. We cannot afford to lag behind countries such as the United States and France. This aspect of the matter is further developed in Appendix I. We have then to choose between development by private enterprise (in which direction the so-called Burney scheme holds the field) or&apos; by the Government.The late Cabinet, I may remind.my colleagues, decided on the former alternative and announced to the House of Commons in July that they had accepted the Burney scheme in principle, subject to the details of the contract being satisfactorily settled by the Treasury. Negotiations with Commander Burney have accordingly been carried to an advanced stage by the Treasury in consultation with the Air Ministry and other Departments concerned.3. The principal defects which seem to me inherent in the Burney scheme (an outline of which will be found in Appendix II) are as follows : (a.) Whilst the Government is not debarred from contracting with other companies for the construction or operation of airships, a virtual monopoly is given to two companies* with interlocked finances, which are, to all intents and purposes, subsidiaries of one of the oil combines, and a powerful armament firm, whose business has world-wide ramifications in foreign countries, and the development of airships and airship research is handed over in toto to these companies for the 15 years&apos; currency of the agreement.(b.) These, companies will, in the natural course, conduct extensive research and experiments, in the main with public money; whilst the results of this research will be available to the Government, there is equally no safeguard other than the Official Secrets Act to prevent their being sold to foreign Powers. Moreover, the companies&apos; freedom to register patents may result in the publication of processes which it would be in the national interest to keep secret.(c.) Whilst provision is made for the repayment of subsidies, the prospect of such repayment is distinctly dubious; it would, in any case, take 56 years to complete repayment, on the assumption that the annual profits available for division between dividends to shareholders and redemption of debentures are 20 per cent, on the ordinary capital of  500,000.(d.) On completion of the payment of the  2,800,000 by way of subsidy,  250,000 (or  41,666 per airship) is to be paid annually by way of fees in return for the availability of the fleet of six airships for defence purposes for a period of 8 years. This  250,000 will, of course, merely secure a lien on the airships; if required for manoeuvres or use in war, full charter rates would be payable in addition, and any experimental flying carried out at the Air Ministry&apos;s request would, of course, be similarly charged for. On expiry of this ,8 years&apos; period, unless the Operating Company is on a self-supporting basis, payment would still be necessary if the ships were to continue to be available.(e.) If the scheme is not a commercial success, the development of airships will be thrown back into the melting pot, and no airships will be available for defence purposes.(/.) The airships will, of course,. rightly be designed to meet commercial needs. * It appears doubtful whether it will be practicable to ensure that adequate considera-* A Guarantee and Construction Company and an Operating Company.[11223] cabinet.SECRET.
tion is also given to defence requirements and that, in consequence, it will not be possible for the potentialities of airships for war purposes (which may conceivably result in large economies in other forms of defence expenditure) to be satisfactorily tried out. Similarly, any bases constructed will be designed and sited with a view to the needs of commercial traffic rather than defence, which may or may not coincide.(g.) Whilst provision is made for breaks in the contract at the end of each of the two first stages of the scheme (i.e., roughly at the end of the 1st and 4th years), should it prove a failure, if the first stage is successfully completed, the Exchequer will be irretrievably committed to an expenditure of  1,200,000; when the third stage is entered upon, a liability of equal amount will be incurred.(h.) Cardington and Pulham, the only remaining airship stations in this country, may pass finally out of the Government&apos;s hands, since they are to be leased to the operating company at a peppercorn rent with an option to purchase. This would almost inevitably entail a very heavy expenditure, should, the Government decide at some future date to maintain its own airships for defence or other purposes.4; Such are the more salient defects in the Burney scheme, some of which, no doubt, it might be possible to remove by drastic amendments to the agreements as at present drafted.. Its advantages, which I do. not seek to minimise, are that, if successful, it will give us a fleet of commercial airships more quickly and more cheaply than any other scheme can hope to do a fleet which will be available for war purposes, though the defence value of the ships will be limited (see 3 (/) above).It remains for me briefly to outline my alternative proposals.5. My colleagues will appreciate that, at such short notice, I cannot furnish them with a detailed programme, but, broadly speaking, the lines on which I should propose to develop airships are as follows : (a.) The Government should be in charge of development and not a commercial company.(&amp;.) The Air Ministry should accordingly be authorised  (i.) To recondition two of the existing airships (one to be kept in commissionand one in reserve) for a series of full-scale experiments; (ii.) To put in hand at Cardington (where experimental and manufacturingplant is already available) the construction of a large new airship,* andin Egypt and India the provision of such ground facilities as may benecessary. ...(c.) When commercial airship undertakings come into being, governmental assistance should primarily take the form of the provision of State-owned airship ports, much as Croydon is at present maintained for use by the existing heavier-than-air services, facilities for insurance at special rates, &amp;c. I do not suggest that, for some years to come, some modified form of subsidy may not be necessary in addition.6. The principal advantages I claim for these proposals are as follows :: /  *&apos; (a.) The defects of the Burney scheme mentioned in (&amp;), (b) and (A) of paragraph3 will not be present.(6.) We shall not be involved in commitments beyond our own control, but, in the event of failure, or if the Government for any other cause should decide not to proceed . with the development of airships, we can at any time call a halt with a minimum of financial loss.(c.) In addition to the essential requirements of commercial traffic and imperial communications, the needs of defence can be taken fully into account in designing the new experimental ship, e.g., provision can be made for gun platforms and for trying out the potentialities of the airship as an aeroplane carrier.(d.) We shall be in a. position to ensure that the development of airships is not unduly &quot;rushed,&quot; as it was during the.war with disastrous consequences; full scale experiments on the lines advocated by the Aeronautical Research Committee after the accident to the R. 38 can be carried out before the construction of a new vessel is put in hand. We shall, in short, be proceeding more slowly than under the Burney scheme, but more surely. - *,* 1 have it in mind as a first step to set up an Advisory Board, which would include representatives of the Admiralty (on the defence aspect) and other Departments concerned (on the commercial aspect), to formulate proposals to serve as a basis for the specification to which this airship should be built; this will ensure that all relevant factors are taken into account.
7. Whilst it is impossible for me to give exact estimates of cost until the details have been worked out, a, four years&apos; programme will be required, involving a total expenditure of  1,400,000 as compared with the  4,800,000 of the Burney scheme. Of this  1,400,000, only  250,000 will be required in 1924-25, as against  400,000 under the Burney scheme.8. The Cabinet are therefore asked to give, authority for the Air Ministry to proceed with a programme of Governmental development on the broad lines indicated in paragraph 5 above, on the understanding that during the next four years&apos;a total sum of  1,400,000 will be made available, of which  250,000, will be provided in Air Estimates for 1924-25. This will entail the rejection of the Burney scheme in its present form. If, however, the experimental ship to be built by the Air Ministry at Cardington proves successful, a great impetus will be given to the commercial construction and operation of airships. I should propose to foster such commercial development by all means at the disposal of the Air Ministry provided always that no undesirable monopoly is created, and lighter-than-air research remains&quot; under governmental supervision and control.T.Secretary of State for Air.Air Ministry, February 11, 1924.APPENDIX I.The airship situation is very different to-day from what it was at the end of 1920 when, in consultation with the Admiralty, the Air Ministry reluctantly decided to close down the existing service airship organisation, the development of heavier -than-air craft being a matter of far. greater urgency. !&quot; -In the first place, successful experiments have conclusively demonstrated the utility of mooring masts, which greatly.lessen the dependence of airships on a series of bases which are very expensive at once to construct and to maintain.Secondly, other great Powers, such as the United States and France, are proceeding with airship development on an extensive scale. The United States is particularly active in this direction, the Navy possessing eleven airships (including two large rigids) in commission, in reserve, or under construction, and the Army thirteen (including one ship under construction for use as an experimental aeroplane carrier). Information has also just been received which points to the early inauguration in France of an extensive lighter-than-air programme.Thirdly, whilst no provision had in 1920 been made for the defence of this, country against air attack, a heavier-than-air Home Defence Force of reasonable dimensions is now in process of - formation, and the number of heavier-than-air squadrons available for co-operation with the Navy has been nearly doubled.If airships on a larger scale than any hitherto built can be successfully constructed and operated in all climates and under all conditions of weather, there is no doubt that they will have a great future before them from the point of view both of civil and military aviation.As regards the former, the improvement of imperial communications is admittedly a matter of the first importance; and the beneficial effects of bringing India within five, and Australia within fourteen, days&apos; journey of this country would be far-reaching.As regards the latter, the Air Staff consider that airships may be of the utmost utility for service transport purposes, and as aircraft carriers. For example, their use would greatly enhance the mobility of our heavier-than-air squadrons as between Egypt, the Soudan, Somaliland, Aden, Palestine, Iraq and India by rendering-possible the rapid transport of squadron stores and personnel from one theatre to another on a scale beyond the capacity of our present troop-carrying aeroplanes.. If this mobility were assured, the economical disposition of our Air Forces in the Middle East would be greatly facilitated. Airships may also have an important role to play in connection with Home Defence.The Air Staff further share the view of the Naval Staff that airships may have great potential value as a medium of naval reconnaissance.
APPENDIX II.THE following is an outline of the Burney Scheme : 1. A Guarantee and Construction Company is to be formed with an authorised capital of  500,000 ( 300,000 to be subscribed in cash) to acquire all necessary . patents and secret processes and to procure the formation of an Airship Operating Company with a subscribed capital of  200,000.. 2. All existing airships and airship material will be transferred to this Operating Company free of cost.3. Cardington and Pulham, the only remaining airship stations, will be leased to the Company at a peppercorn rent with an option to purchase for  500,000, such purchase price to be satisfied by an issue of debentures redeemable in the same way as those in paragraph 8 below.4. Cardington Village will be leased to the Company at a cash rental of  3,000 per annum with an option to purchase for a cash payment of  60,000.5. During the first stage the Operating Company is to receive a subsidy of  400,000 and undertake through the agency of the Guarantee and Construction Company, or otherwise the construction of a 5 million cubic feet airship and necessary mooring masts, &amp;c.6. When the Operating Company has completed a flight from England to India in not more than seven days, the second stage is entered upon, and a further sum of  150,000 is to be raised by the Company, whilst the Government is to provide a further subsidy of  1,200,000, being  400,000 per annum, payable over a period of three years, in return for a weekly service to and from India.7. When the Operating Company has maintained for three months a weekly service between England and India, the third stage is entered upon, and a further sum of  150,000 is to be raised by the Company and the Government is to provide a further subsidy of  1,200,000, as in paragraph 6 above, in return for a bi-weekly service to and from India.8. The total subsidies of  2,800,000 payable over a period of about seven years are to be secured by debentures carrying no interest and only repayable out of profits; one half of the net profits in each year, after providing for reserves, is to be applied to the cancellation of these debentures.9. On the completion of the third stage an annual fee payment of  41,666 13s. 4:d. is to be made for each airship maintained in commission, not exceeding six (making  250,000 for a fleet of six ships), for a period of eight years.10. The whole currency of the agreement is thus fifteen years, and the total amount payable from public funds  4,800,000.
