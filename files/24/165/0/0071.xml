I am in entire agreement, with the First Lord that It is now necessary to refer the interpretation of this Report to an impartial authority and, indeed, I made a definite proposal in this sense in a letter which I addressed to him on the 27th February.   In this letter, however, I suggested that the most appropriate authority to undertake the Interpretation of the Report would be its three authors - Lords Balfour, Peel and Weir,Whilst I hope, that the list of points requiring Interpretation will be short, the subject is one of great complexity and I suggest that a Cabinet Committee could hardly adjudicate upon the issues involved without first digesting the very voluminous documents which form the basis of the Report,   To do so would entail the expenditure of a great deal of time and labour - which my colleagues may feel can ill be afforded at this juncture.Lords Balfour, Peel and Weir are, however, masters of this subject;   they are familiar with the whole of the ground covered;   and surely they are far better qualified than anyone else to say what their precise intentions were.Moreover, I venture to suggest to my colleagues that there are manifest advantages in our making it clear that we are dealing with this question on strictly non-party lines;   and. this would be secured by reference to this authoritative triumvirate whose absolute impartiality and special knowledge of the subject are indisputable.I propose therefore that Lords Balfour, Peel and Weir should be approached in the above sense and asked whether they will consent, in the   public interest, to interpret a list - to be agreed between the Admiralty and Air Ministry - of doubtful points arising out of their Report.It would perhaps be most appropriate that they should be constituted a Sub-Committee %  the Committee of Imperial Defence for the purpose.Should they, for any reason, be unable or unwilling to perform the task, then I suggest that the matter should be referred to a special &quot;ad hoc&quot; Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence rather than to a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet,Air Ministry.
