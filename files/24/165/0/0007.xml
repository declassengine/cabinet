WAR OHaRGSS (VALIDITY) Bill. Hote on the Milk Charges Question.During the war, various Government Departments, in order to prevent traders from making undue profits by reason of war conditions end -also in order to provide for the regulation of control of-various commodities adopted the practice of exacting payments from traders in consideration of the grant,to such traders as desired to avail themselves cf them, of special privileges and facilities which generally but not invariably took the form of licences by tho Departments, In addition to various foodstuffs licences were required for such matters as the transfer of British Ships to foreign flags, steel export,., cotton production, import licences, 2&apos;     In or about June 1919 the Food Controller issued directions under- certain Milk Orders prohibiting persons in the South-western area of England from e -porting milk from that area except under licence from him.     The object was to prevent the dealersin question from receiving an increased profit of Ed&apos;.a gallon, which for certain special reasons they would have received but which they did not earn&apos;and to place the dealers on an equal competitive basis whether they obtained supplies from the area or not,-    The Food Controller received the licence fee of 2d a gallon..3.     The Order in question remained in force for only 4 months and was-.then withdrawn, the position at the date of withdrawal being that the Government had demanded from lioencees a total sum of  26$,000 of which  160,000 had never been paid and  105,000 had   bean ;-.sid by the lioencees.     This  105,000 me -laced in the Pood Tiding Account where it has remained ever since,.-1-
- hi K4.     In 1921 the question of the legality of these Wartime -      v V-Departmental levies came before the Courts in the oase of the attorney-General v. The. Wilts United Dairies, ltd,,, and earlyIn 1922 a decision against the Crown was obtained in tbo Courtof Appeal by the Company.    The then Government, alter considcra-tion of the whole question, authorised a reply to a parliamentary question to the offset that&quot;if an adverse decision of the Court ofAppeal is upheld by the House of lords the Government would bring in a Bill to legalise the Government.1 s procedure., during the War.&quot;5.     In the Spring of 1922 the House of Lords confirmed thedecision of the Court of Appeal in the Wilts United Dairies case.The effect of the judgment   f/as  that the Government was not merelyunable to obtain payment by the LIcenoe.es, who had refused payment,but was under obligation to repay those lioencees the fees&apos;farwhlohhad boon illegally exacted.6.     In July 1922 the opinion of the law Officers was takon on the matter and after consideration by the Home Affairs Committee and the Cabinet it was then decided to introduce a War Charges &quot;Validity Bill,     validating all schemes under which Departmental levies had been made other than the Milk soheme.   Tho reasons for excluding the Milk scheme were briefly as follows:-(a) It would bo very difficult to reverse by legislation a decision of the House of Lords,(b) The Wilts United Dairies Company had undertaken to return to the fsamers the su.ms levied ; this had roused great expeota-tions among the farmers, who would, if disappointed, promote troublesome agitation,(&amp;)   The levy had,Tin: effeett been imposed on insufficient grounds and was removed in September 1919, after it had only been in force a few months.(a.)   The House&apos;of Commons had been informed that, p end hag the decision in the Test case the money was not being&apos; spent, which implied that, the Government would deal with the money in accordance with the result of the Test case,
73     On the 24tli July, 1922, the then minister of Agricultureinformed the House of Commons that effect would be given to the judgment of ths House of lords In the United Dairies case.,. that isto say that the fees would be refunded;   but he went on to say,&quot;She Government will forthwith bring in a Bill to legalise theirprocedure in esses other than the milk charges during ths periodof control&quot;c     The- Bill in question was actually Introduced on thelst.Ar.gust, 1922,. &quot;but could not then be proceeded with owing to lack of time.    It should be noted that the question was debated in the House of Lords in July, 1922. when Lord Buokmaster, whohad delivered the Lords2 judgment on the; case-:, said that, whileit had been found to be cat-side the power of the Pood Controllerlawfully   fco   compel.?     the dealers to pay this money, it was money which they ought in honour to pay.     Lord Birkenhead followed to the same effect, and the House of Lords rejected by 42 votes to 29 the motion calling upon the Government to repay the;se charges. 8a     The question of the Bill again cams before thei Home Affairs Committee and tht Cabinet early In 1923, when it was decided, after the most careful review of all the facts, to introduce the Bill as previously proposed, that is to say,     validating all the levies other than the milk charges..     In coming to the decision to exclude the milk charges, the late Government w*.ra mainly influenced by the pledges which had been given In the House of Commons to exclude such chargeSa9*     In Kerch, 1923, the Government w^re warned, as to the probability of furtheradverse judgments being obtained:against them in the courts by claimants other than milk claimants, the financial effects of which would be most serious- . The Cabinet on the 14th ilarch, 1923, approved a specific recommendation of the Home Affairs Oommittae modifying Clause l(B) of the Bill so as to provide that judgments obtained after the introduction of th*- Bill should be voide
10.   The War Charges Validity Bill was re-introduced in the form approved by tho Government in March 1923 but made no progress because cf congestion of parliamentary business.     It was intended to proceed with the Bill last Autumn but in the same form Q-a when previously introduced, but this intention was not carried out,11,   The Crown have recently lost a case in the High Court brought against them by Messrs. Brocklebank, for recovery of the payment cf  35,000 required from them by the Shipping Controller in respect of the transfer to a foreign flag of one of their ships.12.   notice of Appeal has been given on behalf of the Crown, but there is little reason to believe that the case is distinguishable from the United Dairies case,-13.   The present War Charges Validity Bill (C,P077 (24)) as now drafted validates all the levies, including th6 milk levy.14.   The principal reason for including milk charges in the present Bill is contained in CP, 100 (24) t namely the difficulty of justifying an exemption being made in favour of a charge in respect of milk licences again having: regard to the recent Brocklebank decision^ On the other hand, the Minister of Agriculture (CP,99 (24) has emphasised the Importance of excluding the milk charges having regard to the specific pledges given on the subject in the past..
