[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet. February 1924.SECEET.i3CP. 124 (24).CABINET.14.3SPECIAL REPORT ON  UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 101.   Period ended January 28, 1924.THE last report showed that the number of workpeople registered at Employment Exchanges as unemployed had increased by 113,129 during the last fortnight of December. The figures given in Part I (A) of the present report reveal the fact that steady improvement was taking place, which would probably have made good to some extent the ground lost by the dislocation after Christmas. By the 7th, 14th and 21st January the live registers had fallen by 22,403, 29,669 and 34,428 respectively, as compared with the figures for the 31st December. The railway dispute, beginning on the 21st and ending on the 29th January, interrupted the progress which was being made. During that week the live registers increased by 69,935, so that on the 28tn January the unemployment figures were higher than those for the 31st December by 35,507. There is reason to hope that, failing any fresh dislocation, reversion to the normal condition showing steady progress will be recorded in my next report.The effects of the railway dispute have rendered it somewhat difficult to trace the general tendency in the analysis of the position by industries in Part II of this report, but the situation has been presented as accurately as possible in the circumstances.I would draw special attention to Part III of this report dealing with Juvenile Unemployment.T.

Increase 1,938 (increase 1,957 men, decrease 19 women) due to temporary closing of iron mines and limestone quarries-through shortage of railway trucks, occasioned by the railway dispute. The unemployment register was at this time three times as great as it was in December.Glossop. Increase 2,349 (971 men, 1,378 women) due almost entirely to effects of railway strike, causing shortage of coal at local factories.

Increase 4,086 (3,938 men,148 women)These increases are due almost entirely to the effects of the rail-way dispute at collieries, iron and steel works, and tin-plate works. At Pontypool and Neath the unemployment figure at end of January was five times that for December, whilst at Flint, unemployment was increased temporarily by 300 per cent.II.-POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.Coal Mines. The employment position throughout the country remains good generally, but the industry was more immediately affected than any other by the railway dispute at the end of the month. The shortage of railway trucks caused congestion at the mineheads, and thousands of colliery workers were at once suspended in nearly all the main centres. It is understood that in most districts the congestion was speedily overcome when the dispute was settled, and the general situation is again normal.The Continental trade is slackening, owing, it is reported, to the increased production of the Ruhr coal-fields.New developments in mining equipment are being made at Coalville, Ashby-de-la-Zouch and in the Burton-on-Trent area, and it is expected that the improvements will facilitate the employment of some 2,000 additional miners. In the Nottingham and Derbyshire coal-fields the shortage of railway wagons, apart from the effects of the dispute, is still very acute. In some districts in South Wales there is a shortage of skilled underground workers, and this is being supplied from the surplus in other areas. On the other hand, there is still a surplus of unskilled workers, many of whom are elderly men, in many centres. , Reports from Scottish coal-fields are highly satisfactory. Output has increased during the period. Developments in mining machinery are taking place in the Fife and Lothian coal-fields. New shafts are being sunk to deeper seams, and improved haulage plant is being installed.Stone Quarries. The demand for Portland stone remains good, but a strike on account of a proposed reduction in wages involving 500 workers at the Portland Quarries has been in operation since the 4th January, and remains unsettled. Limestone and Building-stone quarries in Cumberland are generally well employed. * Work in the Cornish stone quarries suffered considerable dislocation during the railway strike, but these quarries are again busy.China Clay. Employment continues fairly good on the whole.[11265j B 2
Iron and Shale Mines. At the Cumberland iron ore mines employment was poor during the period. Several mines in the Cleator Moor district have been closed and there is no prospect of transferring the surplus labour to other mines. In the Middlesbrough district the position&apos;is uncertain. One more mine has been closed down, but two have been opened. Improved gear is being installed in another. No change is reported in the employment position in the Shale Mines which had continued fair up to the end of December.x Tin Mines. In the Cornish tin mines there are how comparatively few skilled miners unemployed. Those remaining out of employment are generally advanced in age and there is not much hope of their reabsorption in the industry,&apos; unless and until there is a marked revival in trade. Unemployment, however, is still serious . amongst surface workers and mine labourers. This industry has suffered extreme depression for a very long time. About 4,500 people were normally employed before the depression set in. The number now employed is 2,300. Of the remainder not less than 1,100, many of them skilled workers, have emigrated chiefly to the United States of America and Canada; 300 have moved to other districts, in this country and approximately 800 workmen are unemployed in Cornwall, representing about 25 per cent, of the workmen remaining in the district.IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION.The position both in the pig-iron industry and in the iron and steel trade generally is still slack. In some districts the railway dispute had a disturbing effect, but on the whole there are indications that these industries are reviving steadily. In the North-East Coast area there are distinct signs of improvement and the outlook is said to be brighter than for some time past. Revival in the home trade has been stimulated by the improvement in shipbuilding, but there has been no advance in the export trade. In the Midlands employment remains bad and has .been increased on account of the railway dispute. Blast furnaces, particularly in South Staffordshire, were wholly or partly disabled owing to the lack of ready supplies of coke. Interruption of transport facilities caused congestion and slack-ness in the finished branches. Trade is fairly good at Tipton and Beeston, but very bad at Walsall, West Bromwich and Willenhall. There has been a slight improve-ment at Wolverhampton. In North Staffordshire employment is fairly steady in the pig-iron industry. The position at Chesterfield remains fair and at Ilkeston all blast furnaces are working, though not at their full capacity. Trade is bad at Wellingborough, and at Kettering there is considerable unemployment in the pig-iron trade due to the inability of firms to obtain fuel. In Wales, employment has been good during the month and the immediate prospects continue to be generally satisfactory. Accumulations of material have occurred at some works. In Scotland the depression in this industry has not yet been relieved by any pronounced improve-ment such as was anticipated. No orders of substantial value have come to hand during the month.TIN-PLATE AND STEEL SHEET.Employment continues very good. In South Wales all works have been working full time. &apos; There has been no unemployment and more skilled men, if available, could be readily absorbed. It is understood that there has been some slackening of enquiries in connection with fresh orders, but the home market continues firm.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Further improvement has occurred in these industries during the period under review, but owing to the unprecedented depression which existed up to November last it will be some time before the employment position can be regarded as satisfactory. Contracts are now being placed for the building of new ships, but it appears that the ships already afloat afford greater tonnage than is required for available -freights, and, until the export trade generally is increased and this tonnage can be fully utilised, it is not probable that there will be a great revival of the/shipbuilding industry. On the Mersey-side a fair amount of work is in progress and additional skilled men have been absorbed during the month in the various shipyards. A further improvement has been manifest throughout these industries on the North-East Coast and a number of orders for new vessels&apos; have been placed. Enquiries are numerous and it is reported from Weirside that the amount of ship repair work is increasing. It is, however, by no means equal to the volume of work in hand prior to the boilermakers&apos; strike.
51.4?Throughout the London area trade is very slack and during the period the depression in these industries has been accentuated. Unemployment has increased at&quot;Falmouth. The dockyards at Devonport, Portsmouth and Portland have been quiet. Ship repairing at Avonmouth is bad. Yacht building at Gosport is practically at a standstill. ship breaking at Plymouth is slackening off considerably. Acute depression continues at Portsmouth. A marked improvement is recorded at Dartmouth. An improvement has occurred during the month at Southampton. The refitting of liners and a fair amount of new construction work are in hand and more work is anticipated in Southampton. Unemployed workpeople from other districts are being gradually transferred to this centre. In Wales the position has varied a great deal as between ports on the Bristol Channel. At Cardiff during the month the unemployed register increased to the extent of 100 per week in this industry. At Newport the volume of work has slightly increased and employment is good at Swansea Docks, where there is no surplus of labour. Slackness is reported from Barry and Port Talbot. At Pembroke Dock there has been a slight improvement, hut at Chepstow the position remains bad.In the Clyde area nine- vessels were launched during the month. of a total tonnage of 36,917 gross more than double the output for the corresponding period last year. The orders coming to hand are mainly for a small class of vessel, although at Dumbarton orders have been received for two vessels of approximately 9,000 tons each. At Govan there are now 5,210 men employed in the shipyards of three firms, compared wdth 3,000 men so employed four months ago. Orders for two new -vessels and a fair volume of repairing work have been received at Port Glasgow, resulting in the opening of one yard which had long been closed, and in&apos; the reabsorption of a number of men. An order for a Union-Castle liner of 12,000 tons has gone to Partick. At Dundee developments in this industry are progressing steadily.ENGINEERING.Motor and Cycle Engineering. Employment generally is not yet good, but con-tinued improvement is reported at several of the main centres. The railway dispute did not result in any serious dislocation in this industry. At Coventry progress has been maintained and emplo^yment has almost reached its normal condition. Reports as to prospects are encouraging. One leading firm has arranged an output of 1,000 14-h.p. cars before the end of March. Light car and motor-cycle firms appear to have their full share of the general improvement. A slight improvement in the cycle-making trade has occurred at Sparkhill. Extensive suspensions at motor works took place during the period at Aston, but work there is now being resumed and the situation is slowly improving. The motor trade is brisk at Tipton and improving at Dudley. A more stable position is reported in motor works at Selly Oak and Derby. In Birmingham there has been serious irregularity of work amongst motor engineers, but signs of the seasonal activity are beginning to appear. Motor engineering has been the most prosperous branch of the engineering trade in the North-Western counties and in this industry employment is good and has improved in the South-Eastern and South-Western districts.General Engineering.-In general engineering the employment position remains bad. In Lancashire, both the textile engineering and general heavy engineering trades remain in a depressed state. The position in structural engineering and electrical machinery making is, however, considerably better. Locomotive engineering shows some falling off at Horwich, but is fairly busy at Crewe and Openshaw. In the North-Eastern counties the gradual revival indicated in the last report has been maintained, although temporary stoppages occurred as a result of fuel shortage due to the railway dispute. Marine engine builders in the Sunderland area are reported to be at work again, and the orders to hand indicate that they will be busy for some months. Locomotive engineering has improved at Elswick, where orders for 12 locomotives for the London and North-Eastern Railway Company and 30 locomotives for the Australian Government have been placed. Smaller orders have also been received from the Nigerian Government. Improvement is reported from Hebburn, where the number of men employed at switch gear works is 50 per cent, greater than in January last year. It is under-stood that one Middlesbrough firm and one Bridgeton firm are the final competitors for a  5,000,000 contract for bridge construction for the New South Wales Government. In many districts, however, including Bishop Auckland, Gainsborough, Halifax, Hartlepool, Lincoln, Sowerby Bridge and Wakefield,
employment-situation remains bad in this industry, and no immediate prospects of improvement are apparent. The agricultural machinery industry fails to show any sign of real revival, as there is no improvement in the export trade on. which this industry very largely depends. The main centres of this branch of the trade, such as Gainsborough and Bedford, are taking a very keen interest in the developments, which may follow the recognition of the Russian Government, and hopes are entertained that resumption of trade with Russia may have an immediate and very beneficial effect upon the agricultural machinery industry as a whole.In the Midland counties employment in general engineering remains bad, on the whole, and there are.no signs of substantial improvement. The position varies, considerably in the different centres. Trade is brisk at Beeston and Chesterfield;, good at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Newark, Oakengates, Shrewsbury and Oswestry; fair at Basford, Leicester, Caldwell, Bilston and Tipton; and bad at Nottingham,. Kettering, Birmingham and Brierley Hill. Slight improvement is reported from Loughborough, Darlaston, Selly Oak and Handsworth. Severe depression continues in East London, but reports from the Home Counties show some slight improvement. In. the South-Western counties, steady improvement &quot;is recorded. Firms engaged in general work report better trade, iron foundries are particularly busy, but brass foundries and engine building works, especially at Bristol, are still slack. Railway works at Swindon and Eastleigh are working at high pressure, and shift work and overtime have been instituted to cope with the work. Bath reports continued improvement;. trade is brisk at Yeovil, particularly in the oil engine section; improvement is recorded at Taunton and Exeter, but slackness is still the feature at Reading and Stroud. Marine engineering is generally slack in all the South Western ports, but improvement has occurred at Cowes.In Wales general engineering remains quiet. All Local Offices qf the Department report poor prospects except Swansea, where trade is fair. In Scotland the general upward tendency, arising from the improvement in the outlook in the-shipbuilding industry, continues, but the full effects will not be felt until a more advanced stage of shipbuilding has been reached. At Bridgeton a firm has secured a  200,000 contract for sugar machinery for Jamaica and increased staff will be-required five months&apos; work being assured. Edinburgh Corporation is allocating a contract at an early date for improvement in gas works equipment, which will cost approximately  180,000.TEXTILES.Cotton.-The general employment position in the cotton industry lacks stability. Large numbers of cotton operatives still remain on short time and unemployed, and. the position has become worse during the month. During the latter part of 1923, unemployment in the Lancashire cotton trade was gradually decreasing, and the level of unemployment reached on the 17th December was the lowest recorded since October 1922. With the advent of the Christmas holiday season, the situation became worse, and, on &quot;the 31st December, the North-Western Divisional Live Register had increased by over 63,000, almost entirely as a result of extended stoppages in the textile industry. On the 7th January, unemployment had decreased by over 37,000. Since that date a very unsteady market, together with the effects of the railway dispute, have created a situation which prevented the industry from recovering the ground lost after Christmas. On the 28th January, the unemployment figures for the North-West Division showed a decrease of 16,000 on the figures for the 31st December.     &apos;Dividing this industry into branches, it may be said that spinning is generally depressed, except that, in the Egyptian Section, previously reported improvement is maintained. - In weaving, the state of trade varies according to the class of goods produced; it is bad in plain, and fairly good in fancy, cloths.Hosiery. The employment position is still bad, but there are signs of increased activity in most of the Midland, centres. Yarn prices are very unstable, however, and manufacturers are loath to give firm quotations for any time ahead. Marked improvement has occurred during the month at Coalville, and there is a better prospect at Leicester, Basford apd Sutton-in-Ashfield. At Ilkeston and Nuneaton there has been a downward tendency, and at Nottingham and Loughborough trade is stationary.Woollens and Worsteds. No change of importance has taken place during the month in the employment position,  but the tendency towards improvement,
previously reported, seems to, have been maintained. Employment Exchanges dealing -almost entirely with textile workers reported a reduction of 4,500 in the unemploy-ment figures during the month prior to the commencement of the railway strikes. On the 28th January increased employment was recorded at Armley, Batley, Bradford, Dewsbury, Morley and Otley. The position was less favourable at Brighouse, Halifax, Huddersfield, and Wakefield. It is stated at Bradford that all Near East marKets are buying fairly well, but with a. preference for the cheaper classes of goods. The Witney blanket industry is fairly busy, and the Wiltshire woollen trade is good and improving. The worsted trade at Wellington has increased during the period in consequence of orders from the United States and Canada.Lace. Unemployment continues to: be very serious&apos; and has increased since Christmas. No prospects of improvement are apparent. The plain net and curtain sections are the most hopeful, but even there the position is very depressed. At Nottingham most of the machines are idle for the greater part of the week; Depres--sion prevails at Beeston and Long-Eaton, and at Ilkeston work is only intermittent.Silk. Trade is still very depressed in the Leek and Congleton district, with the exception of the hose section, which is fairly busy. The artificial silk trade is brisk at Cheadle and Longton, and marked improvement in this branch continues at Derby.Jute. The Dundee district continues to report improvement, and, indeed, -difficulty is experienced in finding the necessary skilled workers. Attempts to introduce weavers from other districts have not been successful, owing to the differences in customs and conditions between this and other classes of weaving.Carpets. Employment remains very good at Kidderminster.BUILDING AND BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Probably more activity prevails in the building trade than in any other industry, and the extension of operations is now practically restricted by the supply of labour in certain skilled occupations. Reports from all districts record that bricklayers, masons, and plasterers are in great demand, and that the absorption of the remaining labour is dependent upon the restoration of the : normal proportions in the key occupations. Seasonal unemployment amongst painters is severe, and large numbers of unskilled labourers remain on the live register.In the brick and tile trade employment&apos; is good at Cannock, Peterborough and Hereford. Fire brick trade at Stamford is fairly good. There has been improvement during the period at Derby and Stourbridge, but serious congestion due to the railway dispute-has caused irregularity. Some firms iD the Midlands were compelled to close down owing to the dislocation of transport. In the South-Western counties employment in this industry remains good, but there, also, the railway dispute caused a good deal of temporary suspension.CLOTHING.Employment in this industry is poor, but the position has somewhat improved during the month. Dressmaking and tailoring in the West of London and wholesale tailoring in the East record some improvement, but the clothing trade in London generally is still depressed. Better reports have been received from the Home Counties, where trade, although quiet, is improving. Wholesale clothing, shirt and underclothing manufactures are reported to have improved at Crewe. and Openshaw. In Manchester there is a shortage of experienced machinists. In Yorkshire there has been marked improvement in the wholesale clothing industry. At Leeds the season is said to have opened with better prospects than for some years past. In the Midlands, wholesale and bespoke tailoring, blouse making-up and dress-making trades are providing fairly regular employment atBasford, Kettering, Newark, Walsall and Wellingborough. but short time working prevails at Birmingham, Derby, Leicester and Shrewsbury. The corset trade has improved at Kettering, where unemployment is now confined to married women, but it remains very depressed at Derby and Rugby. The straw hat trade shows continued improvement, at Luton. In the South-West counties tailoring, dressmaking and millin^y show signs of slackness, and the live register of the Division has been increased by 500 workers in this trade during the month. The wholesale clothing trade is fairly good at Swindon. The shirt and underclothing trade in this Division is reported as bad. The glove and corset trades in the South-West counties are still bad.
BOOT AND SHOE.The employment position remains bad, but there is a brighter outlook in many centres. At Northampton trade is advancing-especially in the women&apos;s section, and some very large orders are being received. There is an increasing: demand for the better classes of footwear. Employment is fairly good at Wellingborough, but some short time is still being worked there. Trade is brisk at Hinckley, where there is practically no unemployment. The situation is satisfactory at Rushden, and fair at Mansfield and Chesterfield. At Leicester there has been considerable improve-ment, but at Kettering and Stafford, although improvement has taken place during-the month, unemployment is still very pronounced. This trade at Derby reports further depression. Reports from Yorkshire, London and the Home Counties show that there has been no appreciable change in the position, and that unemployment is serious. In the South-West counties there has been a fairly heavy decline in this trade during the month especially at Bristol, Kingswood and Redruth. Reports from Scotland indicate that all boot and shoe factories at Ayr and Kilmarnock, where short time had, for some time, been worked, are now fully employed.POTTERY.The employment position remains bad. . Manufacturers have made a fresh cut in the prices of the cheaper classes of goods in an endeavour to stimulate trade, and, on this&apos; account, the situation is a. little more hopeful. Further short time working is reported at Ilkeston, and trade is quiet at Newcastle-under-Lyme. A slight improvement ha.s occurred at Basford, Burslem, Hanley, Longton and Worcester. At Stoke-on-Trent the position is. considered to be better than at the same period of any year since the slump set in, but even this position is far below normal. Trade is good at Chesterfield. The potteries at Exeter, Torquay, Barnstaple and Weston-super-Mare continue to be busy.TRANSPORT.In nearly all districts there has been an increase of unemployment amongst casual workers at the docks. At the time of the last report there had been a temporary increase of activities in consequence of the seasonal Christmas trade, and the depression which occurred in January was expected. Unemployment has increased at the docks at Liverpool, Garston, Salford, at all North-east ports  particularly Hull, the London docks and at sea ports in the South-west. In Wales dock transport work is reported to be fairly steady, except at Cardiff. At the principal Scottish ports the employment of the dockers ijis reported to have been good, on the whole.III.-JUVENILE UNEMPLOYMENT.On the 28th January, 1924, 82,688 juveniles (14 to 18 years of age) were registered at the Employment Exchanges in Great Britain as unemployed. The margin of unemployed persons who are not registered at the Employment Exchanges is considerably wider in the case of juveniles than in that of adults, since juveniles under 16 do not come within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and consequently need not attend at the Exchanges. The number of unemployed juveniles who are not thus registered is unknown.Since June 1921 there has been a marked and continuous decrease in the number of juveniles known to be unemployed.  The comparative figures are shown below : Live Register of Unemployed Juveniles (14 to 18 years) at the Employment Exchanges in Great Britain.		June 24, 1921*	Jan. 22, 1923.	Jan. 28, 1924.Boys..

In most industries juvenile unemployment and adult unemployment are directly related. For example, in districts in which shipbuilding, snip-repairing and engineering are the principal industries, probably from one-quarter to one-third of the juveniles who would normally have been employed in those industries are now unemployed. On the other hand, in Coventry and the surrounding district, the demand, for juvenile labour exceeds the supply, while in Birmingham the number of juveniles unemployed is little above normal.Unfortunately at the present time the unskilled or mainly unskilled occupations are absorbing an abnormally high proportion of juveniles, and the flow of juveniles into the skilled trades for training as craftsmen has greatly diminished. This is due to two main factors : first, owing to the uncertainty of trade prospects, employers are reluctant to incur the liabilities involved in the engagement of apprentices; and, secondly, owing to the disturbance in the ratio between the wages of skilled men in certain occupations, and those of unskilled men in certain other occupations, there is a natural tendency on the part of parents not to allow their boys to become apprentices, particularly at a time when unemployment is widespread and the money coming into the home is thereby decreased. Boys and their parents not unnaturally take the immediate advantage of higher wages rather than incur expenditure in maintenance for the sake of better wages and better prospects of regular employment at the end of an apprenticeship period. In these circumstances boys to-day, therefore, have far fewer opportunities of being &quot; trained in a trade &quot; than was the case before 1914. This special feature of juvenile unemployment clearly affects the future of industry.The fact that training in a trade begins usually at the age of 16 has resulted in the relegation to the ranks of the unskilled of a large number of youths who, in more fortunate times, would have become craftsmen. The unemployed skilled man, however, retains his status until industry again requires his services. In this sense the effect of unemployment on the adult is temporary, but in the case of the juvenile it affects the whole of his industrial career.The practical impossibility of securing &quot; training in a trade &quot; when the normal age of entry is passed is not the only handicap to which the unemployed juvenile has to submit. The difficulties of the period of adolescence are generally recognised, and the adverse effects of unemployment on boys and girls between the ages of 15 and 18 in particular are most serious.The only remedy which has been applied is the establishment of Juvenile Unemployment Centres. When Centres were opened after the Armistice, the full cost was at first borne by the Exchequer, and the attendance in April 1919 rose to 24,683. Subsequently, in November 1919, it was decided to reduce the Exchequer contribution to 50 per cent. In December 1922 the Scheme was revived on the basis of a 75 per cent. Exchequer grant. The Centres were open from January to July 1923, and reopened in September 1923. The present Scheme terminates in April 1924.  The position during these periods is shown below: Juvenile Unemployment Centres.Period.	Number of Authorities which Established Centres.	Number of Centres^ Opened.	Maximum Attendance.1923 : January to July	50	89	8,6101923-24: September 1923 to			April 1924	37	78	7,428The low proportion of unemployed juveniles attending the Centres is due to tlje refusal of important Authorities to find their share of the cost, and to the fact that juveniles under 16 are not within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and accordingly cannot be compelled to attend at the Centres.Among the suggestions which have been made and are under consideration for dealing with the special problem of juvenile unemployment, are the extension of the Unemployment Insurance Acts to include all juveniles in employment, and the raising of the age of compulsory school attendance.
1(1IV.-OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia. New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion Authorities-concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of Nbw South &quot;Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain of the Dominions, have also been assisted. An extension of this assistance to other organisations is under consideration.The number of persons approved for&apos; assistance and the number of departures during the month of December and for the whole period up&apos; to date are set out in the following Table: Dominion.

Y-STATISTICS RELATING TO FINANCIAL PROYISION FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT (including Post-War Resettlement of ex-Members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces), from the Armistice.In this Part a full summary is given under the various heads of the provision made since the Armistice from Government Funds, or other public sources, for dealing with unemployment. It will be noted that it does not include provision made from other than Government or public sources, e.g., the  35,000,000 of work now being put in hand by the railway companies.Schemes of which the Whole Cost is Borne by the Exchequer  Table 1.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance.

Ministry of Transport Schemes.(i.) Road and Bridge Programme, 1919/20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain, and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost approximately  20,000,000.(ii.)

Hi, ... An additional programme was authorised by the Government in October last. This contemplates a Government contribution to a maximum of  8,050,000 towards a&quot; total estimated expenditure of  11,750,000, excluding the possible construction of a new road connecting Liverpool and Manchester, the inclusion of which brings the total programme up to the figure of  14,000,000 announced by Ministers.While there are not yet sufficient data upon which to base a forecast of the rate of expenditure on these schemes, and no grants have yet been formally made, the grants promised represent a Government contribution of nearly  2,000,000, and a large proportion of the balance has been hypothecated to definite schemes.(iii.) Port of London Dock Extension.Early in 1923, the Prime Minister was informed, by the Port of London Authority that certain extensive works could be put in hand at once for the relief of unemployment if the Government would assist with a loan on favourable terms. A loan of  4,500,000 at 3^ per cent, was promised by the Prime Minister. It was arranged that this loan should be advanced from the Local Loans Fund, at the rate of interest, applicable to such loans, the Exchequer undertaking to&apos; pay the difference between the annual loan charges (on the annuity basis), and the 3^ per cent, on outstanding advances to be paid by the Port. Advances were to be repaid in full by the Port at the end of thirty years from the date of advance.Two schemes have been under consideration. The construction of a new deep-water dock and a new dry dock at Tilbury, and of a new deep-water, dock and an impounding station at the Surrey Commercial Docks. Work on the latter Scheme which is estimated to cost  585,000 has been commenced, but the Tilbury Scheme has been abandoned by the Port Authority, as they found that the original estimate of cost would have to be largely increased to about  7,000,000.The Port Authority has, however, recently intimated that it would be prepared to put in hand at once certain other works at Tilbury, including a dry dock and a landing stage at an estimated cost of  1,713,000, provided that the Govern-ment will give financial aid on the same terms as promised for the Surrey Docks, and this proposal is now under consideration.The present value of the assistance promised by the Exchequer to the  585,000 Scheme at the Surrey Commercial Docks, is estimated at approximately  150,000.(D.)

Ministry&apos;.s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the trents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to 1926 the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.q., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement if not conducted through the agency of County Councils.1Land Settlement.(A.)
