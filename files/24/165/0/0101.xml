THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.HCFET^ CABINET COpY HO.    ^ii?.197(24).    Poor Law Authorities in Necessitous Areasin Scotland. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I have considered the memorandum of the Secretary for Scotlanc&quot;, (C.P. 189(24)) as to a grant for necessitous poor law authorities In Scotland.I regret to say that the case made in the memorandum for differential treatment of Scotland does not appear to me so strong that it would enable me to resist the pressure for a grant in England, which is certain to be renewed if a grant is made in Scotland, and I must ask my colleagues to give full weight to that fact in considering the memorandum.     The number of persons per one thousand in receipt of poor relief is no doubt higher in Scotland (though this may not necessarily be true of the actual expenditure per head) and the legislation of 1921 no doubt placed a fresh legal obligation in respect of relief of the able-bodied on the Parish Councils.     But the general increase of ordinary poor law expenditure is common to England and Scotland as is the concentration of the most serious unemployment difficulties in certain areas.I may perhaps add that the formula for a grant proposed for Scotland does not, so far as I can see, get over the radical difficulty of grants, viz. that the more the local authority spends the more It gets.     The proposal is In fact open to all those objections in principle which I set forth In my memorandum CP.135(24) as regards England.Intd.   J.W.nistry of Health. 119th March, 1924.
