THIS bOGUiuKHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERPfiviEHS,.SECRET. CP. 11.8/24. C A B I N E T.AIRSHIP     DEVELOPi^NT. Jgeiriorandum by the First Lord.....of tho Admiralty.I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet the remarks of the Naval Staff upon the proposals of tho Secretary of State for Air (C.P .104/24) .I would draw,attention to tho considered statement of the Naval Staff that tho primary military function of airships is naval.     The United States Navy has 11 airships, the British Navy has none, while France is developing an extensive lighter-than-air programme.     The Admiralty are chiefly concerned in remedying our inferiority in this respect vis-a-vis other foreign Powers as quickly as possible.     This, they believe, can best be carried out with efficiency&apos; and economy and without undue risk to the State by moans of the Burney Scheme.Tho meagre development that can be expected under the Air Ministry&apos;s scheme will preclude us, I should point out, from the hopo based upon the successful issue of the Burney Scheme of being able to substitute airships for Light Cruisers for trade protection purposes with the groat resultant economy.(INITIALLED)      C .Admiralty.16th February. 1924.1.!. hi U
1 $ fixAIRSlilP   DEVELOPmkIW.Haval Staffs General Remarks on heiiiorandum by Secretary of State for Air (g.P .104/24).The comparison of coot between the two schemes, given in paragraph 7, is not on a common basic, vide criticisms in detail attached.   For the first 4 years the Burney scheme costs only  200,000 more than tho Government scheme and provides enough airships for a weekly service to India instead, of only one.2.     If the Burnoy scheme &quot;is a commercial success, airship operations will doubtless bo extended and the Government will have a largo airship industry to turn to when they require. The Government scheme on the other hand will not directly assist the airship industry,3.     Progress is bound to be more rapid under a company which wants a return on its capital than under the Governmentwhich must consider chiefly limitation of expenditure.   Onthe other hand, tho Company is no more likely than the Governmentto incur risks which would not only prevent it from getting agood return from passenger traffic, but destroy public confidence in the whole undertakings4,     Reconnaissance at sea is the primary military noed. The special requirements of reconnaissance do. not appear at all likely to conflict seriously with commercial needs, any more than in the case of the Armed korchant Cruiser.     It is also unlikely that some, at any rato, of the Airship bases prepared for tho commercial route will not be suitably placed for ,reconnaissance over tho routes followed by cteam-shipsj if additional bases arc required by the Government, they could be created without excessive cost.
i 91.&quot;. hi ;5s     Broadly speaking, it is considered that it will be difficult for this country to create and maintain an airship service unless It is based on the secure foundation of a successful commercial business.   It is more worth while to accept the financial risks involved in supporting the Eurnoy scheme than to spend an equal or greator amount of money on a purely military schemo, the continuance of which will depend upon public money being available.&quot; 60     In the Admiralty viow, and to meet ilaval requirements the groat thing is to get a ship in the air, and this it is considered can under present circumstances be achieved more quickly and, if the schemo is a success, to greater advantage by the Durney Schemes
Annexe to naval Staff Remarks.Criticisms in Detail^Paragraph 5c (a- . (b) .This &quot;defect&quot; applies in many ways to naval armament also, and the disadvantages appear to be exaggerated. All aircraft are built by private firms who sell to foreign governments, and the air Council have frequently expressed the advantage of selling machines of new design to foreign government s.(c) This risk is worth accepting if tho scheme results in airships and what ic more important, a live airship industry.(d) This is cheaper than building the airships.(e^   The same result will follow if Government development is a failure or is abandoned on a change of Cabinet.   If one Company drops the scheme it is possible that another will take it up.(f)    Reconnaissance at sea for naval purposes is tho primary defence function and there is no reason to doubt that commercial airships will bo suitable for this purpose.   The naval and commercial needs make it probable that commorcial bases will be suitable for naval purposes, but in any caseadditional bases can he created, if the commercial sites are unsuitable.lg)    Tho first ta^p will, if successful, at least ensure that one airship will be in existence and valuable experience will have been obtained.   The Air Ministry scheme will only provide one new airship and two reconditioned airships of doubtful value.(h)    If the Company buys these two stations the Government will get the money.   This is not mentioned and should be setoff against the hypothetical heavy expenditure required toibuy   /
buy them bach or build new ones.Surely it is of the first importance to press forward with a scheme which it is admitted by the Secretary of State for Air will, if successful, give us &quot;a fleet of commercial airships more quickly and more cheaply than any other scheme can hope to do&quot;.It is not agreed that the primary defence value of those ships, namely, Naval reconnaissance, will be limltodi Commercial and Naval needs are largely similar. Paragraph 5...(a) This has the disadvantage that development will depend on the grant of public money and not on the commercial possibilitiesj that fewer&quot;risks will be takefflj and that the airship industry will not get the commercial stimulus.(b) The reconditioned airships will be of doubtful value, vide the fate of the &apos;&quot;Dixmude&quot;.(c) Under a Government scheme u.ny cOimuercial business will require just as much assistance as tho Burney scheme, though no doubt in a different form. Paragraph 6.j[a2   The defects referred to have been exaggerated.(b) The possibility that the Government may call a halt at any moment will restrict development.(c) The primary function is naval, namely, reconnaissance at sea and should be put before gun platforms, which are covered by the Bumpy agreement, and carriage of aeroplanes.    In the latter case it is presumed the Air Ministry propose that airships should carry aeroplanes, near the scene of air fighting, In which case the airships will have a short-lived career.
The development of airships for reconnaissance purposes is the direction in which the possible saving in defence is the greatest, as should they prove successful, It may eventually reduce our requirements in Light Cruisers for trade protection, (d)   The development of airships Is no more likely to bo rushed by a company which stands to lose its capital than by the Government.     It is certain that development will be slower under Government control. Paragraph 7.For the  1,400,000 under the Government scheme we get, In four years, ono airship.   For the  1,600,000 under the Burney scheme we get, in about four years, enough airships for a weekly service to India.The figure  4,800,000, which includes all subsidies covers fifteen years, not four, and provides a fleet of at least six airships.
