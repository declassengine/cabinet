The Committee, which was appointed, at ameeting of the Cabinet held in the morning of thai same day, had before them thfi attache-,! Report of Sir John Anderson1s Committee on the Future of the. Supply and Transport Organisation (Cabinet paper C.P*314(23) dated 5th July, 19.23),After hearing a brief explanation by Sir John Anderson of the sohame of organisation swt out in the- Report, the committee  agreed:-To recommend the Cabinet to adopt the scheme which, if adopted, involved the immediate- appointment of a Ohlsf Civil Commissionera2, Whitehall Gardensc 12th February; 1924,
(This document i3 the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;6 Government);S 5 0 R g f..P.314(23)        FUTURE OF &quot;THE SUPPLY MID TRANSPORT ORGANIZATION.Roport for tho Cabinet.During the industrial unrest and grave strikes of 1919-21 a speoial Government organization was evolved to deal with the preparation and operation of schemes for maintaining the supply of essentials of life to the community, and tc daal generally with the situation, during strikesj look-outs and similar emergencies,   It consisted of a special Committee of . the Cabinet, known- as the Supply and Transport Committee, with numerous Sub-Committees directing and coordinating particular branches of activity, and, dovetailed in with these, an organization formerly known as the &quot;Supply Department&quot;, with headquarters in Whitehall Gardens, consisting, under a Chief Civil Commissioner in London, cf eleven members of the Government assisted by General Inspectors of the Ministry of Health as Chiefs of Staff, a division of England and Wales being allocated to each (Scotland having a somewhat similar organization under the Scottish Offioe)r and their functions being to supervise and coordinate activities, particularly recruiting of labour, in their areas and generally to aot as principal Government representative on the spot,Shis organisation has not been reviewed since the new Government took office   Moreover changes affecting its construction have taken plaoe during the last two or three years, particularly the disappearance of war-time personnel and the progressive reversion to pre-war Government machinery and Departmental responsibility (including the retrenchment of the functions of the Cabinet Secretariat),   It therefore) appeared to be desirable^ even though no grave emergency might be immediately anticipated, to review the situation and to consider What should be the oullir.es of the organization, if any, now tc be established.   The Prime minister accordingly approved a suggestion that an ftd hoo conference cf Departmental representatives should examine the problem fully in the light of present conditions (CP,860/23). The present report contains tho recommendations agreed upon at successive meetings of this conference.1,   We are clearly of opinion that, if only as a preventive measure, the Government should have ready prepared plans   for dealing with emergencies of the kind indioated in the Emergency Powers Aoi* 1920, i,e. emergencies &quot;nalculated to deprive ,,,, any substantial proportion of thocommunity of the essentials of life&quot;.     Effective plans on a sufficiently comprehensive scale do not new exist, those previously adopted ftaving become to a considerable extent obsolete owing to the disappearance of war-time arrangements in the last two or three years.     An organisation on the lines indicated below should therefore be established new, to stimulate and assist Departments to prepare auoh plans.
-2- 3.7o 82.   The general direction of special Government arrangements for dealing with emergencies of the kind indicated,, and of the planning of such arrange-., merits in advance, should be specifically entrusted to an ad hoc committee of the Cabinet consisting of the Ministers mainly concerned with the Home Secretary or seme other Cabinet Minister in the Chair,, (see also recommendation 13),3, Under this Committee some special coordinating machinery will be necessary, and this is disbussed laterj   but we wish to state at the outset that vie think it undesirable to continue or re-create more exceptional bodies than - absolutely necessary.    Practically all the special war-time organization materiel and personnel on whioh the Government largely relied in past strikes, particularly the Railway Strike of 1919a has disappeared. We desire therefore to re-affirm the underlying principle that each of the Government Departments must be responsible within the limits of its available resources for seeing that suoh arrangements as are possible are made for dealing with the emergency situation so far as it may be affeoted by matters within the sphere of that Department,    For example, the Board of Trade will be responsible for the arrangements to ensure that adequate supplies of food, coal,, gas and other commodities neoessary to the community are available for distribution, and for collecting information regarding   !: such supplies.    They will also be responsible for their distribution by sea (assisted in some respects by the Admiralty),    The Ministry of Transport &apos; should in future be responsible for the arrangements for the distribution of supplies by road or railway or canal and for the supply of electricity,   The Home Office will be responsible for arrangements concerning the preservation, of law and order.    The Ministry of Labour should not however be responsible for the recruiting and allocation of labour - that Department being conoernoc with conciliation and negotiations with the strikers it seems better that it should, as previously, be as far as possible,dissociated from activities whic might be regarded as strike breaking.    As regards Scotland there would be a unified organization based upon the principle of bringing the emergency arrar. ments in Scotland (except general government servioes such as the Fighting Services and the Post Office and to some extent coal and shipping serviaes). under the control of one Minister or other representative of the Government during an emergency.    The details of this organisation will be worked out by the Scottish Office and the Board of Trade in consultation with any other Departments ooncernod.     Coordination with coal and shipping services will require special consideration in detail.It should be for the responsible Minister to say what is the best and cheapest organization which will enable him to discharge his responsibilities it being realised that in many respects it will be impossible to guarantee effective arrangements in view of the disappearance of much wartime materiel and personnel,A few ad hoc,..... executive bodies may however be necessary., at any ratein times of emergency, where more than one Department or no special Departnier/ is concerned, e.g, for Communications, &quot;Protection&quot; or Publicity,,
4.   The executive machine should be -dej^ntralixed -as-inuoii as possible arid&apos; there should therefore be local organizations oapable of being-brought into; existence at short notioe with- persons on the spot who can take decisions and who (Are in touch with the Central Government and with the Local Authori*y ties.    We think that for this purpose the previous scheme of having a number (nay ll) of ^Civil Gommiss5ionersB, who would probably be junior members of the Government, and to each of whom would be allocated a Division of England and -vales, should be oontinued.    We suggest that the Commissioners should be nominated forthwith and be invited to acquaint themselves&apos; with their duties. Much preliminary local work oan be done by their Staff Offieers under cover of their work as Inspectors under the Ministry of Health.    Scotland has a separate looal organization already in course of preparation, and this also should be continued,8.   The function of the Civil Commissioner should be to coordinate the looal services and the looal operation of the national services and to stimulate necessary local activity, particularly recruiting.6. For this last purpose the Volunteer Service Committees (now about 88) set up by the existing Civil  Commissioners&apos; Department should be continued. The Chairmen of these Committees are specially seleoted gentleman of local standing and influence.    All except two are now in office-, and have reoeived instructions as precise as the present state of the other Government sohemes&apos; admits, and in many cases they have been in touch with-their local authorities&apos; clerks.    In timeB of emergenoy each has attaohed to him looal representatives of the national services mainly oonoerned (railways road transport, food,    : postal) and a Pinanoe Offioer (usually a Rational Insurance Act Inspeotor), :7.   The Civil Commissioner should have associated with him, besides his Staff Offioer (a General Inspeotor of the Ministry of Health) and, in times of emergenoy, a Pinanoe Offioer, looal representatives of such Government Depart-ments (e,g. Pood, Coal, Transport, Post Office, Shipping) as may be neoessary having regard to the nature of the emergenoy and looal conditions, and a     j military liaison offioer.    He will also be in close touch with the Polioe. -i8.   These local representatives will have executive funotions under the schemes prepared by their Departments, and they should reoeive in advanoe from, their Departments as precise general instructions as possible, (these being ; coiraaunioaoed also to the Civil Commissioners through the Civil Commissioners;! Department), but we think the normal rule should be that once the emergenoy \ has begun they should, as regards any particular problem arising, be regarded as acting under the directions of the Civil Commissioner.     This rule must however be subject to exceptions as regards some services (e.g. Postal and coal and shipping arrangements) whioh require to be centrally controlled,&quot; nor will the Civil Commissioner normally be responsible for &quot;protection&quot;.. As regards these, he should be kept fully informed, but should assume control only in the event of the area becoming isolated owing to a
o 0breakdown of communicationa between London and the locality concerned, when he would, as long as the isolation persisted, assume the role of the Central Government.9.   The question whether these local representatives should be appointed now or only when an emergency is immediately threatened is one for consideration by the Department concerned when preparing their Sohemes? having regard inter alia to considerations of ecouomy and secrecy (as to which see below),10-.   For coordination of the local organizations it is desirable to appoint a Chief Civil Commissioner in London, &apos; We suggest that he should be a-Minister preferably of Cabinet rank (net in one of the three Service Departments) whose Departmental duties would be relatively light in times of emergency, and who would also be sufficiently free to take an active interest in the schemes in normal times,,   Ho should be a member of the Cabinet Committee referred to in recommendation 2,   His Chief Staff Officer would be a General Inspector of the Ministry of Health,,11-.   The special machinery for coordinating Government activities in London under the main Oabinet Committee shculd we think be cf the simplest possible character^   In normal times it should consist merely of a single standing Sub-Committee meeting periodically in the Home Offioe to supervise the preparation of the schemes and to coordinate them.   The aotual working out of the schemes should be done by the Departments responsible.   Where a scheme primarily concerns more than one Department (ekg5 the Air Mail Schemo? which is primarily one for the Home Offioo and Air Ministry) those Departments should maintain contact by the ordinary methods of correspondence and inter-departmental conversations, one of them being designated by the Standing Committee as responsible for taking the initiative.We think it would be advantageous that the Chief Civil Commissioner should be designated Chairman of the Standing Committee,, even if not always able to attend;   his chief of staff should also be a member^   The other members should be representatives cf tno Homo Office. Scottish Offico;. Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Treasury,. Ministry of Health, Office of Works, Ministry of Transport (representatives for roads, railways; and electricity), Board cf Trade (representatives for food, nines, shipping, petrol, and statistical information), Post Office, Board of Customs and JSxcise, Ministry of Agriculture,, and Ministry of Labour (fcr liaison)^12,   In times of emergency this coordinating body would be too unwieldy, and should be replaced by machinery better designed to secure rapid and effective exeoutive aotion,,: In previous strikes a large number of special Sub-Committees have been set up for this purpose;   we think that this should be avoided in future, most of the work being dona in the ordinary way by the Departments responsible for the various subjects, and that the special Sub-Committees should be limited to the following!(,a) Food Fuel and Transport Sub-Committee consisting of representatives of the iSoard of Tradq, Ministry of Transport, Board of Customs and Excise and Civil Commissioner1s organization, to supervise and coordinate the execution of the schemes for the supply and transport of food and fuel.
protecting persons at work, transport, vulnerable points &amp;c. and for checking disorder.     It should consist of representatives of the Home Office, Soottish Offioe, Admiralty, War Office, and Civil Commissioner&apos;b organization;   in bo far as liaison is required with other Departments&quot;or Sub-Committees (e,g. when any of them applies for protection) this can be seoured by a representative of the Department or Sub-Committee attending the meeting.&apos;j) &quot;osnunioatlong Sub-Committee, to deal with oommuhioations by post,telegraph, telephone, wireless, air mail, and despatch riders, and consisting of representatives of the Home Offiee, Air Ministry, War Offioe, Admiralty, Post Offioe, Scottish Offioe, Ministry of Transport, and Civil Commissioner&apos;s organization,(d) Finance,Sub-Committee. to deal on behalf of the Treasury with applications for approval of emergenoy expenditure and consisting of representatives of the Treasury, of the principal spending Departments (Board of Trade, Ministry of Transport and Offioe of Works), and of the Ministry of Labour (to advise on rates of pay, &amp;0j).(e) Publicity Sub-Coamittee (probably).   This matter is highly specializedand not obviously one for any Deportment in particular.    But in view of the disbandment of most of the publicity officers in Government Departments,, on whom the Government publicity organization has mainly depended in recent strikes, the question what arrangements are needed to enable an effective publicity . organization to be set up at short notice in an emergency requires to be reviewed ab initief and appears to be one for early consideration by the Standing Sub-Committee mentioned in recommendation 11,Some machinery will be required for maintaining liaison between these sub-ooEmittees and for the settlement or submission to the main Cabinet Committee of questions affecting more than one of them and important questions of policy.    We think that this purpose will be served by oon-stituting their Chairmen and the Chief Civil Commissioner a standing co-ordinating Committee,13.   Having regard to the foregoing we reoommend that the main Cabinet Committee should consist of the Home Seoretary, Secretary for Scotland, First Lord of the Admiralty, Secreiary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, President of the Board of Trade, Minister of Health; Minister of Transport, Minister of Labour (to deal with the strikp situation generally) Chief Civil Commissioner, and a Treasury Minister when neoessary,.    There should be two Secretaries, one being also a Seoretary of the Standing Sub-Committee (in normal times) or of the Coordinating Committee referred to at the end of recommendation IS (in times of emergenoy) and the other a member of the Cabinet Sec-etariat.14. On the subject of finance, while it may prove necessary for Parliamentary reasons to deal with exceptional expenditure incurred by the various Departments during an aotual emergency in a single Emergency Services Vote, we think that the prinoiple should be affirmed even more strongly than
heretofore that eaoh of the Departae-nte must be responsible for defending its own expenditure in Parliament,    As regards, e-jcptmditur-e- in-normal times, vie concur in the recommendation made early last year (when the nucleus organization needed in normal times was reviewed), and approved by the Government., that such Department should bear cn its own votes any expend!-ture incurred on its nucleus organization.The total expenses of all Departments on nucleus aoteme-a in-normal times ware estimated early last year as  1,750 per annum,    We believe they-have been considerably less;   but we have not explored this question as the subject would not appear to be within the soope of this report, whioh deals with the outlines of the organisation required.     The actual schemes and their cost will be a matter for the Departments oonoerned when oono: sidering what those sohemea should be (see recommendations 3 and 9),15,   We have devoted some consideration tc the question of keeping secret the establishment of the organization proposed above,    Prior to the strikes of 1919 and 19E0 not only the detail of Government plans but even the exis-tence of the special Government organization was kept largely secret^    For example the appointment of the Civil Commissioners was not announosdp and the instructions to local authorities were not issued, until the last moment-But the problem is new more complex0    There are no longer large numbers of local officials of the Central Government, through whom the sohemes can be workeds and although some looal P.oad and Food Offioers, Chairmen of Committees, &amp;o,, would be appointed who could safely be taken into cor.fi-dence, the sohemes would in future depend for successful working largely on Committees of business men (c^g, in the haulage, food, shipping? and coal trades) preliminary meetings of which would probably involve risk of leakage of the Government planE,     It will be for-the Departments con-ce-ned, when submitting their schemes for approval., to deal also with the question how far the appointment of any particular bodies (or the issue of instructions to particular classes of persona) in advance should be oarried in. the interests of efficiency despite risk of leakage.    Our view on the question generally is that while there is something to be said for allowing the existenoe of a Government plan to become knownj, disclosure of details should be avoided- so far as possible and that in so far as people have to be taken into confidence they should bevtold only what is essential to enable them to perform their functions.    As regards the appointment of the Civil&apos;&apos;Commissioners, persons interested in Government plans for dealing with emergencies would probably assume that they will have been appointed as on previous oooasions and we see no harm in the fact becoming known gradually;   any public announcement;, or their sudden and simultaneous appearance in their divisions in normal times, might of course create a scare and should1 be avoided.If the foregoing proposals are approved the immediate action to be taken by Ministers will be -(a) to set up the ad hoc Cabinet Committee (recommendations 2 and 13)and the standing Sub-Co-wittee (recommendation ll).        j(b) to select and appoint the Civil Commissioners&apos; and Chief civil commissioner (recommendations 4 and 10).&apos; - &apos;      JOHil AEDBRSOH, 5th July, 1923. (Chairman).
