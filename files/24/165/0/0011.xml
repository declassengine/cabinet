CP. Ill (24).CABINET.CROWN LEASES IN BRITISH CONCESSIONS IN CHlNA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. THE British residential concessions in China are areas of land in Treaty Ports leased in perpetuity for the convenience of British traders and residents by His Majesty&apos;s Government from the Chinese Government in return for a small ground rent, usually the equivalent of the land tax formerly levied by the Chinese Government. Leases in these areas have been granted by the Office of Works on terms which have hitherto provided no substantial financial benefit for His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Office of Works now propose to offer the lot-holders the alternatives of (a) continuing to pay the present rate without any security for the renewal of the present leases on their expiration, or (b) renewing the lease forthwith for a further 999 years at an increased rent, based on the present building value of the land.2. Under the latter alternative His Majesty&apos;s Government would profit by about  40,000 a year. But the question of the Crown leases is intimately connected with the much greater question of exterritoriality in China,1 3. The exterritorial system, which in present circumstances is the only satis-factorv safeguard for the trade and residence of foreigners in China, has been severely menaced during the last ten years. The war has diminished the prestige of all the European Powers. Germany and Austria have lost, by treaty, their exterritorial privileges. The Chinese Government have taken over administration of the Russian concessions, and there are now 300,000 Russians in China entirely under Chinese jurisdiction, whose plight is one of the strongest proofs that the maintenance of exterritoriality is essential to the safety of foreign lives and property. The Chinese have been encouraged by these events, and also by the Washington Conference, to look forward in the near future to a withdrawal of all foreign exterritorial privileges and the surrender of all foreign concessions. Events in the Near East and the demands of the Turks for the abolition of the Capitulations have further strengthened the Chinese in their determination to recover full sovereign rights in their own country.4. The situation, therefore, has entirely changed since the proposal regarding the revaluation of the Crown leases was first made, for, until the war, the exterri-torial system remained practically unchallenged. It is owing to this change that the matter must now be viewed in the light of its political implications, and not merely as a technical question of legal rights, though on grounds of law and equity the British lot-holders have submitted a strong protest against any increase in the present valuation of the leases.5. But it is upon the broader lines of principle and policy that I consider the revaluation scheme should be abandoned. Its effect would be to exploit for the benefit of our Exchequer an exterritorial privilege granted to our people by China under treaty and to establish a claim which no other Power in China has ever attempted to exercise, and which we ourselves have not exercised under similar circumstances either in Japan or Korea, or, so far as is known, in any other part of the world.6. Our action, which will arouse criticism among British subjects in China, and among the nationals of other foreign Powers, will provide permanent material for hostile propaganda by and amongst the Chinese. Only recently it has been decided to remit our share of the Boxer indemnity a sum of about  400,000 a year for the. next twenty-two years in order that it might not be said that Great Britain still continues to exact a payment which Germany, Austria, Russia, United States of 2002   [11226]   [11253]
America, France and Japan, whether compulsorily or voluntarily, have either renounced entirely or have applied to purposes beneficial to the Chinese. Is it worth while for the sake of gaining  40,000 a year to follow up a good impression by the creation of a new cause for grievance ?7. The above represents briefly the general view of the question which, is urged upon the consideration of the Cabinet by this Department, but the following paragraphs deal more specifically with certain points contained in the memorandum which was prepared by His Majestv&apos;s Treasury under the late Government (CP. 362 (23))8. The assertion is made in paragraph 4 that &quot; the virtual free gift to a few interests in China of 999 years leases of property worth  6,000,000, seems absolutely indefensible.&quot; As regards the figure of  6,000,000, it should be pointed out that the scheme for the renewal of the leases supported by the Treasury is only calculated to produce  40,000 a year which, capitalised, represents something under  1,000,000, so that if the present reversionary value were indeed  6,000,000, the Treasury would, on their own showing, have already themselves given away  5,000,000, and for no reason, whilst objecting to the remission of  1,000,000, which is desired by the Foreign Office for the political reasons set out above.9: In point of fact, however, the figure  6,000,000 is entirely fallacious. Even if it represents the true value of the. property, were it sold in the open market to-day -and there is reason to believe that it is exaggerated-it must be remembered that some thirty-seven or thirty-eight years of the leases remain unexpired. The present-day value on a 5 per cent, discount basis is somewhere in the neighbourhood of  1,000,000, and that is, of course, the true value of the property. It is, therefore, misleading to speak of a gift of  6,000,000.10. The statement in paragraph 6, that the Foreign Office &quot; no longer attempt to maintain &quot; the arguments used during the discussions in the years preceding the war. is possibly an. attempt to show that they have shifted their ground and are prejudiced. The facts are that from 1912 onwards the time when the question of the Crown leases was first brought up the British representatives in China have been consistently opposed to the Office of Works and Treasury policy. The Foreign Office, on the other hand, did not feel justified in maintaining that opposition on the purely legal and economic merits of the case as against the expert opinion of those two Departments. The result was a compromise confirmed as recently as March 1922. It was not my intention to recede from this position had it not. been for the fact that, in the meantime, the political aspect, which had become immensely more important as the result of the war, was very cogently brought to my notice by Sir J. Jordan, formerly His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking. It is this which has now induced me to urge that the political factor must be the governing one, and not a desire to upset the compromise agreed upon, which was based on the economic merits of the case.11. The reference to the Tien-tsin barracks in paragraph 6 would lead one to suppose that this was a- case of a leaseholder exploiting the value of a Crown lot. As a matter of fact the barracks are situated outside the British concession, and have nothing to do with Crown lease property. But if they had, it would not affect my point, which is not that the mercantile community should be prevented from exploiting the concessions, which indeed were intended for business purposes, but that it is impolitic for His Majesty&apos;s Government to use them for raising a revenue, which the Chinese Government might well feel that they themselves, if anyone, were entitled to.12. As regards the extra-territorial position referred to in paragraph 6, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would seem to argue that this depends solely on what was agreed at Washington. He appears to ignore, however, the growth of public opinion on the subject in China itself, which is more clearly brought out in my memorandum above and in Sir John Jordan&apos;s letter annexed thereto.13. As to the parliamentary aspect of the question referred to in paragraph 8, it may be pointed out that in the case of the remission of the Boxer Indemnity, viz., about  11,000,000 nominal, payable by annual instalments of about  400,000, making the present value probably between  4,000,000 and  5,000,000, I was told by the Treasury that parliamentary sanction was not needed in the case of unconditional remission. As a matter of fact, we are seeking parliamentary sanction^ because we are not remitting unconditionally, but propose to use the funds for educational and other purposes mutually beneficial to China and ourselves. That is to say, we are asking for sanction to the diversion of the funds from one purpose to another, but not for remission. No parliamentary sanction was needed in the case of a total and unconditional surrender. of instalments of some  400,000,. which were by Act of
Parliament already earmarked for the redemption of debt, and had actually been received; up to 1917 (when the payments were suspended for five years in recognition of Chiha;s entry into the war); Why then should jt be necessary in the case of the surrender of  40,000, which is only prospective? .14 The treasury memorandum finally,-states that the &quot; transaction would certainly be brought to light at. the Public Accounts Committee, and the Government would be open to the most damaging criticism.&quot; Unless.the Financial Secretary proposes himself to call the attention of the Committee to the subject, it is.not clear to me how a prospective rental due thirty-seven years hence is likely to, come up for discussion before that body.Annexed to this memorandum is a letter on the subject from Sir John Jordan, who was His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking in 1910 when the Office of Works scheme for the renewal of the Crown leases was first put forward. It may be remarked that from that time to this he has been consistently opposed to the proposal for an increase in the rentals.J. R. M.February 14, 1924.Annex.Extract- from a Private Letter from Sir John Jordan, dated December 7, 1922,&quot;. . . . I. have .... put down very briefly in writing my objection to the scheme for the renewal of concession leases from the point of view of present political conditions in China.&quot; My views on the general question have been so fully recorded in past years. as to make it unnecessary to recapitulate them here. They are in the main in agree-ment with those expressed yesterday by the two representatives of the concession leaseholders,&quot;I gathered that the representatives of the Office of Works:and the Treasury do not consider the question of policy as coming within their province, and it is on that point alone that I wish today stress at present.&quot; For over seventy years all Powers having treaty relations with China remained in the undisturbed enjoyment of exterritorial rights. Quite recently, this situation has undergone a fundamental change, the importance of which we are not yet in a position fully to estimate. The great war and the collapse of Russia have had their repercussions in China, as elsewhere. During the war we did our utmost to extinguish enemy interests in China, and exercised strong pressure on the Chinese Government to enter into possession of enemy property and to deport enemy subjects. This policy received formal confirmation in the Treaty of Versailles, which abrogated the leases of German concessions and led to Germans being deprived of all exterritorial rights.   Austrians shared the same fate.&quot; Russia had enjoyed exterritorial rights and privileges since 1689 and had been the most drastic upholder of the whole exterritorial regime. There are now some 300,000 Russians in China entirely under Chinese jurisdiction, and the Soviet Government has openly proclaimed that it has no intention of reviving any claim to exterritorial treatment. Indeed, one of its ablest and most unscrupulous agents, Joffe, is now being feted by Peking officialdom, and is offering to surrender to China all the numerous rights and concessions granted to Russia under the Tsarist regime. It may be remarked, in parenthesis, that this might seriously affect us in Chinese Turkestan, where our position rests largely upon Russian treaties.&quot; It may be asked, as it was in effect asked yesterday, what has all this to do with the question of concession leases? To me it seems to have a close connection and to point an obvious moral.&quot; Russia, Germany, Austria, and all the new States created by the Treaty of Versailles, no longer enjoy exterritoriality in China. Encouraged by all these developments and by the results of the Washington Conference, there is now a very serious movement going on in China for the curtailment, if not the total abolition, of exterritorial privileges. This movement will, of course, receive the support of our late enemies and of the Russians, and our proposed action in the matter of concessions will, in my opinion, put a very effective propaganda weapon in their hands.&quot;We opened China to the trade of the world, and it has been1 our proud tradition that we claim no rights or privileges for ourselves which we do not
share with the nationals of other Powers. We now propose to. exploit for our national benefit an exterritorial privilege granted to our people by China under treaty, and to establish a claim which no other Power in China has ever attempted to exercise, and which we ourselves have not exercised, under similar circumstances either in Japan or Korea, or, so far as I know, in any other part of the world. What will be the effect on China and on Chinese public opinion, which is keenly alive to all these questions? During all these seventy years China, has received a merely negligible sum in copper cash as ground rent for these concessions, and if we convert them into a source of revenue for our national Exchequer, it would not be surprising if the result were to stimulate the agitation for the recovery of such valuable rights.&quot; What will be the effect on other Powers whose nationals now hold, or may desire hereafter to hold, land in our concessions? Our people obtain perpetual leases in the concessions of all other Powers in China, subject to payment of Chinese ground rent, while their nationals in our concessions will, in addition to ground rent, presumably have to pay a heavy additional impost to the British Government. This is hardly the reciprocal treatment which forms the bond of good relations between the Powers in China, A case in point is that of America at Tien-tsin. America, like all other Powers except ourselves, granted perpetual leases in her concession there and afterwards agreed to its incorporation in the British area. The United States are already rather sore about what they regard as the exclusion of their neople from some British concessions, and they are not likely, I fear, to appreciate this fresh form of discrimination.&quot; We have immense interests in China which can only, in my opinion, be adequately safeguarded by the exterritorial system, and I venture to deprecate any step which may, however remotely, militate against the continuance of that system. A wide breach has already been made in that structure, and it may require all our efforts to prevent it from being still further widened. The present is, therefore, a singularly inopportune moment to exploit an exterritorial privilege of an accidental nature, and a policy of quieta non movere seems to be dictated by all the circumstances.. &quot;If it is merely a question of obtaining additional revenue, there are, as I have often indicated, other means of attaining this without discriminating against any particular section of the British communities in China.&quot;o
