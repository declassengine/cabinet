rfhis Document i&amp; the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for tJiefJabinet.    February 1924;)SECRET.CP. 1.42/24. .The following is the Government of Indians reply to my telegram of the 17th February, circulated with CP. 120(24).OLIVIER.26th February 1024.From. Viceroy, Home Department, 25th February 1924.Your telegram of the 16th instant, 541. Kangachariar&apos;s resolution. In our telegram No. 1855 C. of 19th February, we communicated the precise terms in which Home Member defined the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India, We now desire to explain the considerations which determined the form in which case was finally stated.2. In para. 2 of your telegram, you, explain your reasons for holding that enquiry, with a view to liberalisation of rules under the three named sections of Act, is likely to demonstrate that no substantial advance is possible within limits of the present constitution, and recognition of this fact will inevitably lead to demand for changes of wide scope. Taking these sections separately, we admit the force of the considera-tions stated by you regarding 19a ; they were referred to in Despatch No. 7, dated, loth May 1920, and we have ourselves publicly taken these objections in Home Member&apos;s speech in Assembly, dated 18th July last. Some difficulty, however, regarding the argument then used arises from the fact that wording of the Act does virtually seem to contemplate the divestment, other than in transferred subjects, for which rules have so far only been made; that is to say,-it seems to provide for divest-liient in central and reserved provincial subjects. There seem to be two schools of thought amongst the members.of the Legislature, one maintaining that though seeming constitutional anomaly may be created by the framing of divesting rales, yet this could be facilitated, firstly, because the Act seems to contemplate it and secondly because that anomaly would cease to exist if divestment only took effect in cases where Indian Executive agreed with the Legislature. Other school maintains orthodox view that there can be no divestment until Executive is brought under formal control. We do not desire to exploit question fully here and only indicate these points of view, since, though we have given the matter much consideration, we have not formed any final opinion which would enable recommendation to be made to you. We consider, however, that our enquiry might suitably embrace this matter. We need not say we fulTy realise the wide implications of what we have described as first view, and shall approach the subject with the necessary caution.3. Coming to 45a, we fully agree that public opinion in some provinces,.though not, we believe, in all, might demand such additions to transferred subjects as would amount to what is known as full provincial autonomy.We are impressed with the fact that most advocates of full provincial autonomy do not realise the implications of this step. They neither recognise the incompatibility of provincial autonomy with centralisation of government as now constituted, nor its effect on question of responsibility of Parliament, nor do they take full account of its probable result in disruption of India and check to its advance as united country. Central Legislature in particular does not seem to realise that complete administrative independence of Provinces would have, as eventual corollary, growth of increased legislative autonomy in Provinces and diminution of the powers of Central Legislature. AVe ourselves are far from desiring any measure which would in present or immediate future go so far in direction of full provincial autonomy as to make latter inevitable, for it is not impossible that Statutory Commission may desire to find solution in development on somewhat different lines, which, while giving Provinces all necessary administrative and legislative independence, would, nevertheless, make it possible to retain lor Central Government such, essential authority as will prevent disruption. Nevevthel(.&apos;s;.,.m;r think it worth while investigating minor changes which would not 7123     100 2.24     &apos; -..
involve this result and might facilitate working present system. This would,&quot; of course, also involve examination of Devolution Rules, which admittedly contain many difficulties.4. As regards 96b, we agree that no enquiry made by us should anticipate recommendations of Royal Commission. Latter has already shown anxiety on subject, and Home Member, at recent interview, gave them assurance on the subject.5. Admitting, however, that possibilities of enquiry into advance under the Act are not substantial, we, nevertheless, do not think that the enquiry should be entirely ruled out, so long as its scope is clearly understood, and definitely limited beforehand. Announcement made by Home Member was designedly made in form intended to safeguard the position, and is, we hope, acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.6. We have made no announcement on the subject of Committee as matter is still under our consideration.
