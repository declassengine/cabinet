V   &apos;Since the date - of that Memorandum the market price- of &quot;Insulin has been materially reduced,&apos; Instead of costing from 20/--,to SO/- per week r,er person the -cost; would/probably now be something .1 ess than 10/-per week. &quot;-      &apos; ;&apos;&apos;it necessary, however, to press for legislation lines of-the- draft Bill attached, hereto,   In England1875, -the: local auLhor^-QXOb pplv cf medicines to the-pburor . Ministry- of Health have, decided to uiruise T,nis section tor. one Period of a year..   In Scotland there is.no-such power&apos; in the Public-Health (Scotland) Act,&apos; 1897/ - hence; the necessity for a Bill, for Scotland.&apos;   I consider: for Scotland, on the under Section 133 of have peter to protide a tcmp&amp;r irihg-bjtahts: of-&apos;-&apos;-their tiiuti ilii. this section fur biPubli:c Health Act,The&apos;From a conference between representatives of the Scottish Board of Health and the Ministry -;,&apos;  Health I learn that the MinistrPJtake -exception^ to the form of legislation proposed for Scotland and&apos; suggest that a clause similar. to&apos;&quot;Section 133 of -the English Act of &apos;1875 would bo&apos;more suitable;. To&apos;-this my answer is as &quot;follows;--(a) A statutory provision which&apos;is specifically -declared&apos;tt? &quot;temporary&apos;&apos; seems hardly appropriate as authority far.the provision of a drug like Insulin, which may have to be cjohtihuod through a per3 6n&apos;s life, and I much prefer the form of the Scottish Bill, -..,--&apos;...-..(b) The Bill, it will be observed,&apos; is aiinbly an enabling Bill-. and applies only to Diabetes.   In the draft formerly circulated pro-visionwas made for the inclusion of other diseases, that, in the &quot;course of medical research, may at any unforeseen time&apos; reach the same plane .of urgency.and specific treatment as Diabetes;   but or/reconsideration, I propose to limit the Bill to Diabetes.oe provl; Already, as pointed out in 0.P.66 (24) insulin treatment may aed for insured persons and paupers, as well as expectant mothers, and nursing mothers and children under Maternity and Child Welfare schemes,   Tnis Bill proposes to cover the   oase of the remaining persons to many of&quot;whom an outlay of 8/- to 10/- a week, perhaps lor several years, may be a verv serious financial burden.On these grounds I ask for the apuroval of my colleagues the introduction of tho Bill.&apos;\ah.
