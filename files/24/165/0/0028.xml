[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet,   February 1924:.SECRET.Q.P. 128 (24).CABINET.BRITISH GUARANTEE FOR THE BONDS TO BE ISSUED UNDER THE IRISH FREE STATE LAND ACT OF 1923.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WITH reference to Conclusion 2 of the meeting of the Cabinet held on the 13th February, 1924 (Cabinet 13 (24)), I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of the Financial Agreement between the British Government and the Irish Free State Government, dated the 12th February, 1923, and copies of despatches which passed between the two Governments in December last.It will be seen from paragraph 2 (B) of the Financial Agreement that His Majesty&apos;s Government is pledged to guarantee the bonds to be issued under the Free State Land Act, and that this pledge was repeated and confirmed in the despatch from the Duke of Devonshire, dated the 22nd December last,Apart, however, from the fact that the British Government is pledged to the Government of the Irish Free State in this matter, I regard the early introduction of a Bill on this subject as desirable for another reason. Irish landlords, whose property will be purchased under the Act, have constantly expressed their fear that the bonds in which the purchase-money will be paid will, in the absence of such a guarantee, fall far below their face-value, and that they will thereby incur serious loss. . I do not believe that there is any real justification for this fear; but I have no doubt that tl\e giving of the guarantee will afford much satisfaction, at no expense to the Exchequer, to a body of men who at present feel that they are suffering under an injustice ; and it was with this in view, I understand, that the late Government mentioned the proposed Bill in the King&apos;s Speech.If the Bill is to be introduced, I see no object in delay, and I trust therefore that rny colleagues will authorise the Chancellor of the Exchequer to proceed with it at once.J. H. T.Colonial Office,February 21, 1924.FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND THE IRISH FREE STATE GOVERNMENT..    ,:    I.     - lb -/,&apos;(A..)-Completed and Pending Purchase Agreements.

If the Admiralty desires to remove for its own purposes any of the fixtures, unerected plant or floating craft, the I.F.S. will agree to the removal of so much as will not prejudice the working of the yard subject to the I.F.S. being given credit in the ultimate financial settlement for such part of the property removed, as is not surplus to normal requirements yoa the analogy of military movables under the &quot; Heads of Working Arrangements&quot;).4. (a.) The I.F.S. contends that &quot;normal requirements&quot; mean the requirements of the yard when carried on as a dockyard, whatever be the use to which it is put hereafter by the I.F.S.(6.)
