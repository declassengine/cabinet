The adoption of such a policy is open to the gravest political, economic and financial objections and it is in the highest degree improbable that, even if adopted, unemployment would be permanently relieved or the public interest   safeguarded.(30) That the question of removing the existing bar to assistance being given to the Railway Groups, the only substantial public utility undertakings which are at present Ineligible for Government assistance, should be considered after the results of the Conferences between Ministers and the Railways are known,(3l) To take note that the Unemployment Com-mittee hope to be shortly in a position to report to the Cabinet on the following outstanding questions :-(a) Juvenile Unemployment(b) The position in certain basic industries (o)   Unemployment among women.(d)   The Railway Groups and Unemployment Relief Undertakings.
