S3 0 R 3.T. Copy Ho.0, A B I IT 3 T .g.p. 138 (24).Crown Leases in British Concessions in China.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the &quot;Exchequer..I regret to find myself in disagreement with the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary in his memorandum C.?,111 (24), K*st of the arguments in that memorandum hare been answered, -to ay mind in a most convincing manner, in the memorandum of the Piret Commissioner of works (C.P.131 (24)).     I shall accordingly confine myself in this memorandum to observations on the parliamentary aspects of the matter.The&apos; impression I gather from the concluding paragraphs&apos; of the Foreign Office memorandum is that in that Departments view it is open to the Government to make a gift of its interest in the leases without the cognizance of Parliament.     On this I would observe that, while it is true that Parliamentary authority waa not sought for the decision to remit the Chinese Boxer Indemnity,  the attention of parliament- is speedily to- be brought &apos; to the Government&apos; s action in the matter.     2&apos;. ore over in transactions between ITigh Contracting Parties it is frequently the practice for the Government of the day to act on its own responsibility, and I do not think that a proper comparison can be drawn between such a transaction and that now proposed, where an interest in public property is to be surrendered withoutc ons consideration
*) g r,C; U Jconsideration to private companies.     In my view/ a closer analogy is to &quot;be found in the practice which is now obligatory on all Departments of State to bring to the notice of Parliament any proposal to make a gift of public stores or property exceeding  10,000 in value, and not to give effect to the gift till Parliament has had an opportunity,  if it sc wishes, of expressing its views.       If so small a matter as the gift to a Dominion of an obsolete ship cannot he made without the cognizance of Parliament, surely the abandonment of so important a financial asset as the immediate enjoyment of  40,000 a year in&apos;perpetuity should not be authorised without the fullest publicity.     I, who am specially,responsible for safeguarding the financial interest of the country, fesl bound&apos;to protest at such a transaction being carried out secretly^For dp I think that if an attempt were made to conceal our action it would have the least chance of succeeding. This question of the renewal of the leases has been ventilated for years past in China.       The Comptroller and Auditor General is aware of the matter and is likely to call for papers and report what has been done to the Public Accounts Committee. Many of the ministers of the late Government, especially Sir W. Joynson-Hicks, hold strong Views on the subject and would probably question the Government on it.But even if publicity :1s not given in either of these ways, what about the various rich corporations whose leasehold properties it is proposed to turn into freehold, with a consequent increase of millions of &quot;pounds to their assets?   Will the Chairman of these corporations refrain from informing their gratified, shareholders how greatly the Labour Government has beenmis-judged; ..
mis-judged, and how such mofo tenderness It has exhibited towards private interests at the public expense in comparison with previous Governments ?      Much stress, is laid in tho Foreign Office memorandum on the Views df 3ir S. Jordan, who is a Director of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China which stands immensely to gain by the concession pro-posed by the Foreign Office.     It would be open to the Chair-man of that institution to congratulate the shareholders on the wisdom of having on their Board ox prhlic servants.In short I can well imagine, if the Government were to attempt to carry out the proposed transaction secretly, there would be an occasion ready to hand for a public and. Parliamentary agitation of the first magnitude.     She Trans-action proposed by tho foreign Office is as though the Offitn? of Woods were to give peppercorn rent.I feel Quito convinoad that, as recom;:.recommend-od by the fir it Co:V i3sioner of &quot;vorks, the original sch-emo for the re-newal of leases ought to be allowed to
