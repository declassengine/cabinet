(This Document Is the property of His Britannic ftajestyJs Government).vCP. 106  (84). HOME. AFFAIRS GOJIJITTSEoWHITE LEAD.   \ Memorandum by the First Commissioner of works.With reference to the Hone Secretary!s Memorandum, GcPo 53 (84) recommending the ratification of the Geneva Convention concerning the use of white lead in.painting, the only comment which I think 1 need make is in regard to the inter-pretation of the words &quot;industrial establishments&quot; in Article I of the Draft Convention,,   My technical officers suggest that the exception might be extended to certain public buildings such as County Courts, Post Offices, and particularly Employment Exchanges, which are subjected to so much usage that the internal paint-work has to be washed at frequent intervals.   They contend that paints at present available will not stand so much washing as lead paints, and that if the former have to be used more frequent painting will be necessary, with the consequent disturbance of the occupants, quite apart from the additional cost of maintenance which would be considerable.I wish, however, to make it perfectly clear that I do not desire to press this point as regards County Courts and Post Offices, and I am even prepared to abandon the distinct advantage of the use of lead base paint in Employment Exchanges if it is in any way likely to prejudice the ratification of the Convention.(Intld).
