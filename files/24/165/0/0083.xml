!TTS DOOOKSHT IS TUB. property OP HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Memorandum, by the Minister of Transport.In accordance with the decision contained in gabinet Conclusions 19 (24) of March 12th, 1924, I sutanit for tho consideration of tho Borne Affairs Committee a draft of the London Traffic Bill.    The Bill is the same as that considered by the Committee on February 29th, with the following changes:(l)    A declaration has been inserted in clause 1 that the bill is for the purpose of facilitating and improving the regulation of traffic to and near London until an authority is constituted for the local government of an area including the administrative eounty of London and&apos; surrounding districts.Tho Clause  has also boon changed to carry out the suggestions made to the Committee at their meeting on February 29th, and embodied in my memorandum CP.163(24), which wero approved to prtociplo by tho Cabinet at their meeting on March 12th.(2)    Clause 9 is new and requires persons holding licences to supply Information to the Minister and places on him the duty of reporting annually to Parliament,     In addition it gives to the Minister the right of inspection of all accounts, books and documents.     While this lattor power is not strictly essential to connection with any single clause of the*Bill, it is considered that traffic services are so closely connected with financial quostlons that from time to time occasion will ariso vrhon the Statutory Cbmmitteo should have information on financial points, and for this purpose I am of opinion33crejc.,OA BIKE T.
that full power to require disclosure is necessary.

(3) Certain drafting alterations which do not affect the intention of the clauses.

The Cabinet gave an instruction that it should be made perfectly clear in the Bill "that all the interests

"concerned would be represented on the proposed Advisory

"Committee, and that no particular transport company

"would be given a monopoly of licences or of traffic".

The first part of this instruction is carried out by Clause (3) and the second part is met so far as it appears possible by Clause 8 (2)(b) which makes it perfectly clear that the intention of the Bill is not to give any single proprietor a monopoly but to apportion among the various proprietors the right to run in restricted streets. It would obviously be Impossible to make it mandatory that there should be more than one proprietor in every street because there might be only one application for the right.

I ask leave to introduce the Bill.
