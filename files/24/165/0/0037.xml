[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet. 9 s?-?st (j JLSECEET. CP. 136 (24).CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a despatch from Sir Herbert Samuel on the situation in Palestine.J. H. T.Colonial Office,February 25, 1924.The Right Hon. J. H. Thomas, M.P.,His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir, Jerusalem, January 25, 1924.IN December 1922, after the change of Government that took place at that time, i presented, for the consideration of your predecessor, a survey of the political and economic condition of Palestine. It may be convenient in present circumstances if I now submit a despatch on similar lines, repeating the greater part of what I then wrote, but with such additions and modifications as the events of the past year require. The survey may best begin with a brief account of the elements within Palestine and outside, which, in combination, create the problems with which we have to deal.The Moslem Population.The large majority of the population of Palestine are Moslem Arabs, and, among them, a majority, possibly equally large, favour the general views of what may be termed the local opposition to the Palestine policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, as applied by this Administration. Three currents of thought combine to create and to maintain this opposition. First, there is the Arab National movement, which desires to see the establishment of a great Arab Empire, of which Palestine should form a part; a movement which was always hostile to Turkish rule, and which welcomed the British as the agents of liberation. Second, there is the anti-Zionist movement, which came into existence after the occupation, which is inspired by a dread of submergence under a flood of Jewish immigration and of political subordination, sooner or later, to a Jewish Government. Third, there is the pan-Islamic movement, which commands the support of numbers of religious Moslems, which sympathises with Mohammedanism wherever it may be found, and feels it to be its duty to adopt whatever course in Palestine may best contribute to the advancement of the common cause, paying only secondary attention to the facts of the local situation. These three motives intermingle. The minds of some men may be more influenced by one, of some by another. The majority of the Moslems of Palestine are probably moved, in greater or less degree, by all three.The Opposition party is composed, like all parties, of men of different standards of sincerity and zeal. There is a nucleus of genuine patriots, who would be willing to make considerable sacrifices for their cause. There are a number of young men who take pleasure in the excitement and interest of a political movement, there is a large fringe, who sympathise in general with Arab and Oriental views, but take no great interest in the matter one way or the other; they are ready to [11291] B   &apos;
close their shops, if they are shop-keepers, when asked to do so by the Central Committee on some occasion of political protest, and they are willing to join a crowd in the street to speed a parting delegation or to welcome its return; but they are quite content, in the long run, to accept the established order of things, whatever it may be, without serious demur.In Palestine, as elsewhere in the Arab world, there is much dissension between families and constant quarrelling between individuals. These disputes are carried into the political sphere, and the Government derives a good deal of support from groups and individuals for no other apparent reason than that leading opponents of the Government are also opponents of those groups or individuals; and, on the other hand, it has to face the hostility of the enemies of its friends.While it must be repeated that many of the leaders of the movement are quite sincere ana estimable men, there are many others of a different character. Some follow what is, at the moment, a popular current, and pursue a course which they consider may gain them influence. Some are animated by personal motives of no worthy kind. I would mention confidentially that one of the most prominent of the leaders intimated directly to the Administration some time ago, that he was quite ready to leave the movement, and, indeed, to damp it down, if he were given a Government post. Another has presided at meetings at which resolutions have been passed declaring, inter alia, that no Arab land must, in any circumstances, be sold to Jews, he himself having recently sold a large area for Jewish settlement, for which he has been paid in quarterly instalments. Arab landowners are, indeed, offering to Jewish organisations many times the area which it would be possible for them to purchase.There is also among the Moslems a certain section who take a different view. Their number is smaller, but it contains some of the leading men in the country. They are, in general, Arab Nationalists, but they recognise&apos;that Palestine cannot at present govern itself; they welcome the British Mandate and believe in the sincerity of our declarations that we will help the country to ultimate self-govern-ment. They realise that the accusations that the land of the Arabs is to be taken from them and given to the dews, and that a Zionist Government is to be established to dominate the majority are false. &apos; Pan-Islamism makes little appeal to them. They are anxious for a quiet life, and do not want to engage in political struggles. They wish to grow richer, and think that British control and guidance, for the time being, at all events, are best calculated to make the country more prosperous, and themselves with it. Some, as I have mentioned, are largely animated by antagonism to persons in the Opposition camp. Some think that they may obtain advantages, direct or indirect, by standing well with the Government. Many regard the question of the Balfour Declaration as a chose jugee, and do not propose to waste time, energy and physical comfort, on beating their heads against a brick wall. All these make up what has come to be called the Moderate party. Within the last few months this party has had the courage to come openly into the - political field; Its leaders have held a public conference, which was attended by a considerable number of delegates, few of whom, however, were of note. They have an active organ in the press; they have conducted a vigorous propaganda through-out the country; they have engaged in violent polemics with the group which thitherto had a monopoly of political activity, accusing it of gathering large sums of money from the people, and spending them on the maintenance of costly delegations in Europe, which have achieved nothing. The declared programme of the new party differs little from that of the old; but it is known that their extremism is mainly for purposes of propaganda, and that they are more ready to co-onerate with the Administration and to accept reasonable proposals in a practical spirit.The Christian Elements.The Christians of Palestine number only one-tenth of the Moslems, but their education, enterprise and comparative wealth give them an influence out of pro-portion to their numbers. In presence of the very exaggerated ideas, which at one time prevailed, as to the real meaning and probable effect of Zionism, the leading native Christians joined with the Moslems to form the Moslem-Christian Association to combat it. This organisation is in effect what I have termed the Opposition. Christians are also numbered among the principal leaders of the more Moderate party. The Orthodox Patriarch and his immediate followers, however, have always held aloof from the hostile movement.  The Latin Patriarch, who has from time to
close their shops, if they are shop-keepers, when asked to do so by the Central Committee on some occasion of political protest, and they are willing to join a crowd in the street to speed a parting delegation or to &quot;welcome its return; but they are quite content, in the long run, to accept the established order of things, whatever it may be, without serious demur.In Palestine, as elsewhere in the Arab world, there is much dissension between families and constant quarrelling between individuals.

In presence of the very exaggerated ideas, which at one time prevailed, as to the real meaning and probable effect of Zionism, the leading native Christians, joined with the Moslems to form the Moslem-Christian Association to combat it. This organisation is in effect what I have termed the Opposition. Christians are also numbered among the principal leaders of the more Moderate party. The Orthodox Patriarch and his immediate followers, however, have always held aloof from the hostile movement.  The Latin Patriarch, who has from time to
time issued denunciations of Zionism, has recently been more reticent. The Greek Catholic Archbishop, who had previously been- one of the most active leaders, in the north, of the opposition movement, withdrew some time ago from it. Generally, the Christians have become more lukewarm. This change is due primarily to the growth of pan-Islamism, and to the fear, especially after the Kemalist successes in Turkey and the concession of independence to Egypt, that it might have consequences in Palestine such as the Christians are far from desiring.The Jews.The remaining element of the population is the Jews. In number they somewhat exceed the Christians. About one-third of them live and work in agricultural villages. Several of these villages were founded thirty or forty years ago and are now firmly established. Both the urban and the rural population are increasing. One cannot come into touch with these communities, even if it were by a very brief contact, without being impressed by the reality and vitality of the Zionist movement in Palestine. And by Zionist movement I mean the movement to repopulate as much as possible of the country with Jews, to revive the Hebrew language and Jewish institutions, to emphasise the intellectual and spiritual sides of life not less than the economic. There are some, indeed, among these Jews who are also animated by the ideal of a Jewish State, but little&apos; is heard now of that distant goal. There are probably a few, also, who are by nature or training revolutionaries, and who wish to promote revolution in Palestine not less than elsewhere. I am convinced, however, that the proportion of these is quite insignificant, certainly not more than the pro-portion of avowed Communists in the population of Great Britain. A numerous body are the old-fashioned Orthodox Jews, whose interest in general politics is remote or non-existent, although a group among them carry on an agitation against the rest of the Jewish community. But the vast majority of those who count are idealists, inspired by the Zionist purpose which I have defined; at the same time, they are practical men and women, in that they realise that the community they wish to create cannot consist only of intellectuals, but must have a sound economic basis, that it must have land and houses and industries. They set&apos;themselves to work to create or acquire these things.Whoever visits the new Jewish settlements is impressed by the spirit that animates them thousands of young people in the prime of life, mostly of good education, making roads, building cottages, breaking up uncultivated land, clearing stones, draining swamps, working in newly-established workshops, facing, in the cheeriest spirit, every kind of hardship, worst of all, in many places, the risk of malaria. They are encouraged by the knowledge that they are watched and supported by the Jewish people all over the world. There is no Jewish community from Shanghai to California, and from Amsterdam to Cape Town, but knows what is being done by the Jews in Palestine and follows every development of the Palestine question. And this has an important bearing upon the political situation here. The local Jewish community feels itself an integral part of a far larger body, and is conscious that it is so regarded by the larger body itself. Any wound inflicted upon it is a wound to the whole organism. Hence there has sometimes been a tendency to state the claims of the Jewish community somewhat higher than the local situation would warrant. There is much industrial and agricultural development proceeding by means of Jewish capital and labour. Within the last five years the Zionist Organisation and allied bodies and individuals have invested or otherwise spent in Palestine a sum which is probably in the neighbourhood of  5,000;000. Indeed, almost all the new economic activity that is proceeding in Palestine is. Jewish. And this process is capable of almost indefinite expansion. The country is lamentably empty and undeveloped. There can be no doubt that, looking only to the near future, it could maintain a largely increased population, with no disturbance or loss to any of the present inhabitants. What is needed is capital, enterprise and additional supplies of kbour. It is the Jews, and the Jews alone, who are able and willing adequately to supply all three.Outside Influences. *The domestic situation in Palestine is greatly influenced by the course of events in the outside world. Although it is only a small minority of the Arab population that is politically awake, that minority is very much awake. The Jewish population in general is keenly political. The course of events, in Great Britain particularly is closely followed. Every debate, or question and answer, in either House of [11291] B 2il
Parliament, and every declaration by any political leader, relating to Palestine, is reported in the Arabic, the Hebrew and the English newspapers. (There are dailies and weeklies in Arabic and Hebrew, several tri-weekly papers in Arabic and one weekly in English.) Whenever there appears to be any uncertainty as to the future course of British policy in relation to Palestine, the effect is immediately felt in the domestic political situation. There is a very large section of opinion here, as in all Eastern countries, which desires, if possible, to be on the winning side, but on no account to be on the losing side. This section tends to oppose the local Administra-tion, or to co-operate with it, according as reports from London indicate that the1 British Government is likely to modify, or to maintain, the policy hitherto pursued.The situation in Palestine is greatly influenced also by any event which affects the Moslem world as a whole. The victories of Mustapha Kemal over the Greeks, and the prospect of a revision of the Treaty of Sevres between the Allied Powers and Turkey, had a marked effect in stimulating the Arab opposition in Palestine. The achievement of independence by Egypt, the Khalifat movement in India, the establishment of an Arab Kingdom in Iraq and of an Emirate in Trans-Jordan, all have had their influence here.Furthermore, the Arabs of Palestine are in constant communication with King Hussein of the Hejaz. The relations between them are the resultant of different forces. On the one hand King Hussein is regarded by many as a very incompetent governor; he is looked upon also as a Beduin King of a Beduin State, which is much below Palestine in its level of civilisation. On the other hand, he is recognised as the principal leader of the Arab national movement, and his family are generally considered the natural heads of any combination of Arab States which the future may bring forth. On the whole, King Hussein enjoys at the moment considerable influence here, and the Arabs in general, while they would probably not be ready to render obedience to whatever wishes King Hussein might express, would be unlikely to take any definite action in direct opposition to his advice.Lastly, among outside forces, there must be mentioned the influence of France. This is mainly of a negative character. The methods pursued in Syria by the French administration are not popular, and whatever may be the criticism in Palestine of the British administration, there is probably not one among the Arabs who would wish it replaced by a French. It is well known, however, that the French have long had ambitions with regard to Palestine. The disappointment in France, when Palestine was separated from Syria after the war, and the mandate for Syria alone was allotted to her, was freely expressed. It is possible, or even probable, that if the British were to withdraw from Palestine, the French would soon enter. The Arab leaders are fully aware of this, and they find here one of the most cogent reasons that lead them to offer no serious opposition to the exercise of the British Mandate.Economic Conditions.Palestine is mainly an agricultural country, and agriculture, here as elsewhere, is not prospering. Since 1920, prices have been low and the harvests fair or indifferent. Arab methods of cultivation are primitive; the land as a rule is not manured; the yield is poor. The Jews adopt modern methods, but often find it difficult to make sufficient profits to maintain their higher standard of living. The system of taxation, continued from Turkish times, presses heavily upon the cultivator. One-eighth of the value of his crop is taken as a tithe. And the rapid fall in prices has greatly diminished the yield of this tax to the Treasury. The same cause has lessened the Customs revenue, which is almost all on an ad valorem basis. The shrinkage in its two chief sources of income has made it exceedingly difficult for the Government to avoid a deficit in its Budget. It has been necessary to cut down expenditure to a minimum. Many measures which are obviously needed for the development of the country have had to be abandoned for want of funds. Belief from the heavy taxation and Government assistance for the improvement of agriculture and of education, have had to be postponed or curtailed. The Adminis-tration would deserve, and would gain, more popularity than it has so far won if it had been able to find the financial resources for the measures of improvement, the desirability of which is universally admitted. And it is an important consideration that the bulk of the Arab population, who take no keen interest in political con-troversies, are susceptible to anti-Government propaganda to a degree which is in direct relation with their contentedness or their discontent with the economic conditions in which they are living.There are, however, some favourable factors in the situation.   The restrictions
S 9  9Sj t? Uimposed by the Turks, which placed the whole of the tobacco trade in the hands of a State monopoly, and forbade the cultivation of tobacco in Palestine, except in a few villages, were completely abolished soon after the establishment of the present administration. Tobacco is now freely grown over large parts of the country; the quality, where it is properly cultivated and cured, is excellent; the taxation is light; the crop yields large profits; and if the industry, now in its infancy, succeeds, many of the agriculturalists may find here a way of escape from their difficulties. The production of oranges and of melons is on a large scale, and is remunerative. Considerable additions are being made to the number of olive trees. In general, the area of land under cultivation, and the number of animals in use for agricultural purposes, are steadily increasing.In most of the towns there has been a remarkable building activity during the last two years, and this is still continuing, though on a reduced scale. A few large, and a number of small, industrial enterprises have been started, mostly under Jewish auspices, though the Arab population also shows tendencies towards industrial and commercial progress.A concession was granted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in September 1921 to Mr. P. Rutenberg, a Jewish engineer of Russian nationality,, for the provision of electric power throughout Palestine from energy derived from the waters of the Jordan. Mr. Rutenberg has succeeded in raising the greater part of the capital required for the first stage of his scheme, which is planned on a comprehensive scale. A beginning will be made this year with the principal power-house in the Jordan Valley, not far from the south end of the Sea of Galilee. Meantime, a power-house,, with oil-fuel engines, has been erected at Tel-Aviv, the Jewish suburb of Jaffa, and is supplying that district with electricity. Similar supplies are contemplated for Haifa and Tiberias. These power-houses will remain as spare plants for use in emergencies after the water-power has been brought into use. The scheme contem-plates, in its later stages, the irrigation also of large areas of cultivable land which now lie derelict for want of water.Work of the Administration.Fortunately the Government has not been wholly restricted for its expenditure to the funds raised by annual taxation, but has been permitted to borrow from the Crown Agents ia sum of over  1,620,000 in anticipation of a public loan. This has enabled it to effect essential improvements in the railways and to equip them with adequate rolling-stock, with the result that they are now paying their way, to provide an adequate telephone and telegraph service, which is also remunerative; to create an excellent system of roads, which has allowed motor transport to be used on a considerable scale throughout the country, and has incidentally facilitated the reduction of the garrison by rendering the forces more mobile. An efficient Public Health service has been established, and much progress has already been made in combating malaria, hitherto the principal danger to the health of the people, and a grave obstacle to development. Elementary education has been fostered, about 200 new Arab schools having been opened by the Government, and eagerly welcomed in all parts of the country. An Agricultural Department has been established, and renders useful service within the limits allowed by the small financial resources placed at its disposal. An efficient police force maintains public security at a far higher standard than in Turkish days. An honest Judiciary dispenses impartial justice.This work is, of course, no more than a small beginning. Three or four years are not enough to enable much headway to be made in the redemption of a derelict land such as was Palestine; and particularly since the financial stringency has been severe, owing to the modest revenue of the country and the prolonged delay, due to external causes, in the issue of the loan. But the improvements, limited though they are, which the people see proceeding before their eyes, have conduced to the acceptance of British rule in many quarters; and the better conditions under which commerce and industry can now be conducted have rendered possible the commence-ment of a general economic growth.Course of Events, 1920-1924. *- Such, then, are the elements that make up our complex situation, and such the conditions under which this Administration carries on its work. I will now briefly summarise the principal events of the last four years.[11291] b 3
* Not reprinted.At the beginning of 1920 the tension between Arabs and Jews had reached an extreme. Serious disturbances took place in Jerusalem in the spring of that year. The country was in a state of much excitement. In Egypt, in Iraq and in Syria widespread revolts, which caused hundreds of deaths and great expenditure, took place about that time, and it seemed to be possible, or even probable, that a similar outbreak might occur in Palestine. On the 1st July, 1920, the Military Administra-tion was replaced by the present Civil Administration. The atmosphere continued electric for some time. Eiots and bloodshed, even more serious than those of 1920, broke out in Jaffa and the neighbourhood in May 1921. But since that time the country has been becoming gradually more and more peaceful. There was one small riot in Jerusalem on the 2nd November, 1921, which lasted a short time, resulted in few casualties^ was suppressed without the use of fire-arms, and did not spread elsewhere. With that exception the country has now been free from disturbances for nearly three years. *This situation has enabled the garrison to be steadily reduced in numbers and in cost. The charge under this head to the British taxpayer was 4 millions, in round figures, in 1921-22, and 2 millions in 1922-23; it is l\ millions in the present financial year; the estimates that I have submitted for 1924-25 are about a million; as they include certain amounts for non-recurrent charges, it may confidently be expected that, if no untoward events occur, the expenditure in the following year will be reduced to a sum in the neighbourhood of  750,000. An efficient local Gendarmerie has also been created, maintained hitherto from Palestine funds; and if local revenue expands, it is hoped gradually to increase the numbers of this force, with a corresponding reduction in the numbers and cost of the British troops.The expenditure of the Civil Administration is defrayed entirely from the local revenues, and has been so defrayed from the beginning.In the summer of 1922 an event of much importance was the issue by the ,British Government of a considered declaration of policy with regard to Palestine. The interpretation to be placed upon the Balfour Declaration of November 1917 was defined; the aims of British action were clearly declared, and false imputations were disavowed; the lines to be followed in the future were indicated. For convenience of reference I append to this despatch a copy of that document,* upon which the subsequent actions of this Administration have been entirely based.The policy as defined was officially accepted by the Zionist Organisation, which undertook that its activities would be conducted in conformity with it. It was not accepted, however, by the Arab Delegation, which was in London at that time, representing the Moslem-Christian Association of Palestine.In August 1922 an Order-in-Council was issued establishing a constitution for Palestine, and placing the administration on a formal and regular footing. Under its provisions a Legislative Council was to have been formed consisting of the High Commissioner, ten other official members, and twelve elected members. Of these, eight were to be Moslems, two Jews and two Christians. The elections were ordered for February 1923, but the Opposition conducted an active propaganda against participation, The reason given was that they did not accept the constitution as a whole, because it embodied the Balfour Declaration, and because it did not concede complete and immediate self-government. The Administration did not attempt to exercise any pressure upon the people to take part; a large majority, except among the Jews, abstained; and the elections were subsequently declared null and void.There had been an Advisory Council in existence since the formation of the Civil Administration; it consisted of ten official and ten unofficial members four Moslems, three Jews and three Christians; its functions were purely consultative; the personality of its members carried much weight in the country, and its deliberations had always been harmonious. On the issue of the new Constitution this body had disappeared, but on the failure of the elections, it was decided to revive it. Twelve of the most influential men in the country eight Moslems, two Jews and two Christians were invited to serve, and they all accepted, in writing. Under extreme pressure from the Opposition, however, the Arabs mostly withdrew their acceptances, and the Council never met.The next event was the decision of -His Majesty&apos;s Government, after an examination of the question by &quot;a Committee of the Cabinet in July 1923, to offer to the Arabs the formation of an Arab Agency. This was intended to be a consultative body, representative of all sections of the non-Jewish community; it was to be a counterpart of the Jewish Agency provided for under the Mandate for
Palestine, with whom the Administration was required to consult on matters relating-to the establishment of the Jewish National Home and to the economic development-of the country. The Arab political leaders in October rejected this offer of an Agency also, and the country is at present being governed without the participation of representatives of the people.Meantime, the Mandate for Palestine, which had been provisionally passed by the Council of the League of Nations in July 1922, but had been suspended owing to certain outstanding matters relating to the French mandate for Syria, came into full operation in September 1923.Present Political Situation.It is remarkable that, in spite of the failure of each of the successive attempts to come to an accommodation with the Arab opposition, the political situation has continued to show a marked improvement. The country is undoubtedly more tranquil at this moment than at any time since the British occupation. It cannot be said that equilibrium has been established, or that this tranquillity is by any means secure. Conditions may change. But the improvement&apos; is so far satisfactory. All the District Governors report that the atmosphere is no longer electric, that little is heard of political opposition, that there are at the moment no symptoms of danger.*I attribute this improvement to a combination of causes.First, and in my opinion the most important, is the fact the British policy in Palestine has been placed upon a basis of certainty. Vacillation, in a country such as this, is fatal. The agitation two years ago in a portion of the British press against the Palestine policy, a hostile motion carried in the House of Lords, constant questions in the House of Commons, the support accorded in some quarters to the Arab Delegation in England, gave the impression that the foundations of British policy in Palestine were insecure, and might possibly crumble. This situation has been remedied by the declarations of two successive Ministries, and by the final promulgation of the Mandate in its original form. The ground has been cut away from under the feet of the Opposition. On the strength of their discomfiture, a second party has lately come into being. And a third, representing the fellaheen,, is now showing signs of formation. The people, a majority of whom are anxious only for quiet, and are by no means hostile to the Administration itself, find themselves relieved, in these conditions, from the dominating pressure of a single forceful organisation.The second cause is the conclusion of peace with Turkey. So long as that large international issue remained unsettled, there was always a possibility that the status of Palestine might undergo a change at the eleventh hour. Here again a cause of uncertainty has been removed. Moreover, the recent action of the Angora Government with respect to the position of the Sultan has alienated Moslem opinion here. The prevailing confusion with respect to the Caliphate has weakened the Pan-Islamic forces in Palestine as elsewhere, and has lessened the strength of the external influences that have contributed to trouble the internal politics of this country.Thirdly, the White Paper already quoted has powerfully tended to lessen the fears of Zionism, which, inflamed by the exaggerated declarations both of its friends and of its enemies, were the chief cause of the difficulties and dangers of the earlier period. Facts have compelled a more moderate attitude on the part of almost all sections of the Jews (Mr. Zangwill and the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; of London excepted). The fears among the Christian population of oppression at the hands of the Jews have lessened; their normal state of apprehension of Moslem domination has revived. The mass of the people, no matter of what creed, are not by nature turbulent; they are in the main a kindly and acquiescent folk; in the absence of any actively exciting cause, they are now tending to revert to their usual attitude of placid acceptance.A fourth cause of the improved situation may perhaps be found in the reconciliation of popular opinion to the rule of this Administration. It is difficult to keep up a constant agitation for a number of years against oppression and favouritism if there is no oppression and no favouritism. Alarmist pictures of future ruin do not carry conviction if time goes by and no one is found to be mined.11,y&quot;&quot;ld venture to submit that it is inadvisable to refer in public utterances to the greater tran-quuiity ot the country as a proof that the people are satisfied with the present political conditions. They are not satisfied, and any such statement might almost be regarded as an invitation to disorder in order to prove that they are not.-Herbert Samuel. b
The policy of the Government has been to proceed steadily with its constructive work, to the extent that its financial resources allow, not to be unduly perturbed by the vehemence of protests on the one side or on the other, and not to be tempted by threats of violence, or even by actual disturbances so long as they are not serious, to govern the country with a heavy hand. Except to secure the restoration of order after the disturbances of May 1921, I have been very averse from adopting unusual measures. Although delicate situations have often arisen, there has been, except at that time, no censorship of the press, there have been no political prosecutions, there has been no declaration of martial law, there have been no political deportations (with the exception of some Bolshevik agents expelled in 1921, and of one other man, of comparatively small note, deported for a limited time and soon permitted to return). And contrary to the practice often followed by Governments of various nationalities in the East, no one has been bought and no one has been subsidised. Not a pound has been spent by the Government in douceurs to individuals or in subventions to newspapers.Nor has the policy been pursued of establishing the simulacrum of a native Government, while retaining real power in our own hands. The Administration in its higher ranks is frankly British. Palestinians are introduced into it as they show their capacity; the number of British officials of all ranks and in all Departments (including the railways, but excluding Gendarmerie officers) has been reduced in the last three years from 377 to 271; but the heads of all the Departments and of all the Governorates are still British. I believe that this course is not more unpopular, and 1 feel sure that it is administratively more successful and more useful to the people, than the opposite plan pursued in Syria, where Syrians ostensibly fill all the principal offices, but where the real power, as everyone in the country knows, is wielded by French Advisers.I have, however, called into being a Supreme Moslem Council of five members elected by the leading Moslems throughout the country, according to a constitution framed by themselves. This Council is charged with the duty of managing the very valuable Wakfs (religious endowments) and the Moslem Religious Courts. It has been given full control; the entire responsibility has been placed squarely upon its shoulders, free from Government interference. Further, certain revenues, which undoubtedly are Wakf, but which had been diverted by the Turks, have been, with the sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government, restored to their original objects and transferred to the administration of the Moslem Council.On the whole the policy of government with a light hand has been successful. The opposition movement has not been driven underground. There are no secret societies, or none of any importance. There have been, as yet, no political assassinations, or attempted assassinations. The leaders of the Moslem Christian Association have used their, influence, with sincerity and with effect, to prevent disturbances. My principal officers and myself are able to maintain quite friendly personal and social relations with all the leading members of the Opposition. The British officials in the districts are personally popular and exercise a remarkable authority-an authority which, in times of stress, is worth several battalions.The Jewish National Home.Yet the Arabs continue to express, by constitutional methods, their dissatisfaction with the existing situation. And they are not alone in that. The Jews are disappointed with the slow pace at which their ideals are being approached. During the war a large part of the Jewish population of Palestine perished or emigrated. Since the war only about 30,000 immigrants have come in. Of these some 4.000 have not remained. The great majority of these immigrants are from Eastern Europe. The immigration restrictions imposed by the Palestine Administration are severe, and must necessarily be so, in order to avoid a serious unemployment problem; for the number of Jews who would desire to come to Palestine is far in excess of the present economic capacity of the country to absorb them.The Jews are disappointed also because the Government is not in a financial position to render any appreciable assistance to their schools. The present cost of those schools, provided from Jewish sources, is indeed more than equal to the whole Education Budget of the Palestine Government, although the Jews are only one-ninth of the population of the country. Further, the acquisition of land by Jews has had hitherto to be effected by their own efforts and without Government assistance. And the legal constitution of a body representing the Jewish Community as a whole, and empowered to promote its development, has not yet been effected; partly owing to disagreements within the Community itself and partly owing to discussions, not yet concluded, between the Colonial Office and this Administration.
9 q n p-O w&apos;But at the same time the Jews see their agricultural colonies increasing in number, in population, in healthfulness, and in security. They see new Jewish suburbs rapidly growing up in the vicinity of the principal towns. They see a number of important industries being established &quot;by Jewish enterprise. More valuable still  and the ultimate purpose of it all they see a gradual but sure strengthening of the Jewish spirit on its cultural side; a Jewish University is on the point of commencing its work; higher education in general is developing; a school of Jewish art nourishes; music, even opera, is enthusiastically supported; a love of athletic sport is taking hold of the younger generation; the Hebrew language is now firmly established as a vernacular tongue; a keen interest is being shown on all sides in the political, social and economic questions of the age. The Jews have a right to be, and they are, full of confidence that their undertaking in Palestine taken as a whole, in spite of all obstacles and difficulties, will succeed.Conclusion.This despatch has grown to such a length that I must reserve for another occasion a statement of the present situation and the future prospects in Trans-Jordan, a matter closely connected with the fortunes of Palestine, but with its own problems and separate complexities. And I cannot deal here with the tasks of the future in Palestine the needed reforms in taxation; the settlement with His Majesty:s Government of several financial questions of importance that are still outstanding; the issue of a Government loan; the placing of the British Gendarmerie, which now forms the principal part of the garrison, on a less provisional footing; the construction of a harbour; the development of the mineral resources of the Dead Sea; the expansion of the Department of Agriculture; and many other matters of less, but still of considerable, importance. These must all remain for later presentation.I cannot, however, conclude without an expression of appreciation of the assistance which I have received, in unstinted measure, from the Department over which you, Sir, now preside. In the task of building up an administrative system from its foundations, whilst contending with a constant succession of political difficulties, the co-operation of the Colonial Office has been of invaluable help. A long experience drawn from the greater part of the British Empire has been placed by the Department freely at the disposal of this new Government. Information, suggestions, and not less useful criticisms, have been readily forthcoming, and no trouble has been too great in assisting to render the system of administration in Palestine stable and efficient, so that the terms of the Mandate confided to Great Britain may be fulfilled in a manner not unworthy of the greatness of the trust.I have, &amp;c.HERBERT SAMUEL,High Commissioner.f
