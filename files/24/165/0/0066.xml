Extract from a letter from Sir Charles Bayley, &amp;.C.I.&amp;., X.C.S.I,, Senior Member of the Council cf India to Sir James Brunyate, LCiiJ,, Cr,It:E,,, dated 10,3.24,&quot;&quot;You, Vincent, and the others will of course put\ all the points as strongly as possible and far better than I could put them, but there is just one that I want to urge -the terrible humiliation underlying the draft as a whole -the suggestion that the Empire which has made India what it is. (at any rate what it was till recently), that the ling-Emperor&apos;! s Government should say to the Extremists and Seditionists who are striving to make Government impossible, who are abusing us in the vilest terms, who have been declaring that we must leave the country, 1 come and shake-hands with us; tell us what it is you don&apos;t like, and send a deputation over to explain matters to a special committee1. Whatever the answer may be, the harm, is done by the proposal. What prestige does it leave us?     &quot;What will loyal Indians (there are many of them and would be many many more if we dich^t constantly alienate and snub our friends and pander to our enemies) think of us?    What will the Indian Army think of us?     What will the Native States think of us? How can we look any of them In the face?     How can we expect any of them to rally to us?&quot;
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet,      March 1924,SECRET.CP. 164 (24).Draft prepared by Sub-Committee of Cabinet for approval of Cabinet.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Private and secret. In my private telegram No. 651 of 27th February I explained to you desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government, if possible, to establish better under-standing with spokesmen of advanced Indian Home Rule Party. His Majesty&apos;s Government have now given further consideration to this matter, and desire me. to ascertain your views upon the proposals they have provisionally formulated with this object.2. As already made clear His Majesty&apos;s Government stand upon policy embodied in preamble to Act of 1919, and do not contemplate recommending to Parliament any change in the provisions of the Act, subject to possibility of your desiring to consider any such as result of the enquiry which your Government have, with His Majesty&apos;s Governments approval, announced your intention of holding.3. At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot, and are anxious not to, ipnore the change in situation which has resulted from, creation of Swarajist or Nationalist party and its large representation and influence in Assembly and in several provincial Councils, this change consisting in the existence of a strong, organised and intelligent body of opinion which is in danger of subordinating chances of progress towards what they and His Majesty&apos;s Government unite in regarding as lndia&apos;s goal to impatient and destructive opposition. They wish, therefore, to endeavour to establish, friendly relations with the leaders of this body of opinion, to discover the grounds for distrust so frequently expressed of bona fides of intentions to advance towards responsible government, and grounds for dissatisfaction with present admittedly transitional form of constitution as a step towards responsible government.4. Holding it essential, in the interests of the British and Indian peoples, that there should be mutual understanding and co-operation in the development of self-governing-institutions in India, they desire your advice on feasibility and desirability of issuing through you an invitation to a delegation to visit this country in. order to confer with a Committee of both Houses of Parliament containing outstanding representatives of three political parties here, one representative of each party from each House. The sort of Committed they have in mind might consist of Secretary of State as Chairman, with, if they would, consent, such persons as Peel and Buckmaster from Lords, and Wedgwood, Austen Chamberlain and H. A. L. Fisher from Commons.5. If this idea is to be pursued, it. is obviously essential that objects and scope of discussion should be defined with utmost possible precision. I send you herewith a rough draft of what has been suggested for this purpose, excluding the actual announce-nient of the individuals or classes of persons to bo invited, and am anxious that you should feel entirely free, in giving your opinion upon it, to make any suggestions for alteration you think fit. In its present form the draft recites the charges brought against the British Parliament and people in the Swarajist election manifesto, and is directly challenging in character. You may very possibly prefer a more conciliatory form, but, if so, it must still be kept in mind that the reasons for discussion are to be found in the altitude of the parties who made the charges, and its object is to clear up misunderstandings :--&quot; Wherkas in the recent elections for the Legislative Assembly of India 53 members have been returned as representatives of the Swaraj Party, a number considerably exceeding that of the members representative of any other party :&quot; And whereas the representatives of the Swaraj Party were elected on the basis of a declaration that that party believes that the guiding motive of the British people in governing India is to serve the interests of their own country, and that the so-called reforms are a blind to further the said interests under the pretence of granting responsible&apos; government to India, the real object being to continue the exploitation of the resources of the country by keeping Indians permanently in a subservient position to ^ British citizens and denying them at home and abroad elementary rights of citizenship, and that it is daily becoming clear that the British people, while professing equality of treatment, are in practice subjecting the Indian nation to humiliation and insult where the British influence is supreme;&quot; And whereas members of other parties to the number of 25 have joined with the members of the Swaraj Party in passing a resolution indicative of dissatisfaction, with tho working of the established constitution :7iw    i o :i.a4
&quot;And whereas this declaration and this attitude are in direct contradiction to the actual and clearly expressed desires and intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government and their predecessors, and of successive Parliaments, in regard to Indian affairs, and particularly in regard to the design and purposes of the Government of India Act of 1919 and its preamble :&quot;It ts desirable that an enquiry should be held on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government into the causes of distrust and dissatisfaction expressed and indicated in these proceedings and in pursuance of this purpose to ascertain : -&quot; (1) What are the grounds conceived by those representatives who have adopted these declarations for their distrust of the, sincerity of the British Government and people in instituting the reforms referred to, and for their conviction that these reforms are a blind to further the interests of Great Britain and have as their real object the continuance of the exploitation of the resources of India by keeping Indians permanently in a subservient position to Britain and by denying them at home and abroad elementary rights of citizen ship. &quot; (2) Having regard to the intended and declared purpose of the reforms in question, namely, to promote the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible govern-ment in India as an integral portion of the Britiah Commonwealth of Nations embodied in the Government of India Act, 1919, what complaints are made in regard to the operation of these reforms as an effectual instrument of their intended purpose ?&quot; Here would follow an invitation in suitable terms to be addressed to the parties concerned.With a view to (2), the Government of India has already declared its intention to proceed with measures to make full investigation as to any defects or difficulties which may have arisen in the working of the transitional constitution now in force, and if their enquiries into defects of the working of the Act show the feasibility of any advance within the Act (that is to say by the use of the rule-making power already provided by Parliament under the Statute) will be prepared to make recommendation to this effect.While, however, this latter portion of the enquiry must in the first place be conducted by the Government of India itself as proposed, it is desirable to take some more direct means to establish contact between the two peoples and to enable His Majesty&apos;? Government and the British Parliament to apprehend and to consider the gravamen of the more general complaints indicated in the earlier part of this preamble, and to enable those who make them to apprehend the true facts of the situation.6. In considering this draft and any announcement which would have to be made public you will, of course, bear in mind the importance not only of precision, but of avoiding language which could be construed as implying a pledge to make any further change in Act or rules [than such as might result from your own enquiry announced in Assembly]. It cannot be made too clear that purpose of present proposal is not to pave the way for immediate changes in the constitution, but to endeavour to arrive at a friendly understanding with those without whose co-operation no constitution will work.&apos;&apos;7. If your opinion of this proposal is favourable composition of delegation is a matter which will require most careful consideration, and on that I desire yoiu&apos; advice. Thus, should it consist only of members of Assembly or contain also a. member of each provincial Council? What arrangements should be made for watching proceedings on behalf of Indian Government and for criticising, correcting or rebutting questionable representations ?8. In considering this proposal, will you also consider whether it might have better effect if put forward as proposal of your Government, warmly concurred in by His Majesty&apos;s Government and not as that of His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves? This might discount, possible impression that Swarajists had secured victory over Government of India by inducing inquiry over their heads into complaints against them.9. I have made this telegram private as most suitable form for consultation at this stage, when secrecy is of importance. But you are, of course, at liberty to consult your Council upon it in confidence. You will, however, realise how unfortunate might be effect if any of parties concerned were able to assert that the knowledge that this proposal was under consideration had been used as inducement to carry Finance Bill. There would be an obvious temptation to represent any communication while Bill, is pending as definite promise of constitutional advance, and final results, whatever they might be, as less than what was promised. This is what makes me press the peculiar importance of secrecy in your immediate consultations.
