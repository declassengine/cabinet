Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Memorandum covering the Coastguard Bill.     This Bill is necessary to regularise the transfer to the Board of Trade of the Coastguard Force, which was effected by administrative action a year ago.     It should not be controversial.S.?f.Board of Trade. 18th March, 1924.
COASTGUARD BILL.Following upon the Geddes Committee, the Chanoellor of the Exchequer appointed an Inter-Departmental Committee to enquire and report what establishment was necessary for carry-ing out the civil duties of life-saving, revenue protection, coast-watching, etc., discharged by the Coastguard under the Admiralty, what arrangements should be made for a division of responsibility and oost between the Departments, and what economy, consistent with the maintenance of the necessary national servioe, oould be effected.&quot;That Committee, in its report Cmd. 1753, recommended inter alia that the Coastguard Force&apos; should be transferred to the Board of Trade and should concern itself, primarily, with duties connected with life-saving, undertaking such other duties for Government Departments as could continue to be -undertaken without prejudice to their primary duties.The transfer, which took plaoe on the 1st April, 1923, was effected by administrative action, but the Admiralty have consistently held the view that it would be nooesBary to repeal or amend the. Coastguard Service Act 1856, by which the Coast-guard was put under their control, and the Office of Works consider that serious legal difficulties will arise in connection with the tenure of lands and houses if the transfer of the Admiralty leases is not provided for by statutory enactment.   The Office of V/orks also require power, similar to that possessed by the Admiralty under the Coastguard Act, 1856, to acquire land compulsorily for Coastguard Stations and look-out huts.     A Coastguard Bill has, therefore, been drafted and agreed with the Departments concerned and is attached.
Clause 1 (l). This clause transfers the Coastguard from the Admiralty to the Board of Trade and preserves any rights the Coastguard have under other Acts of Parliament.Clause 1 (2). The Coastguard Service Act 1856 is repealed, except Sections 5 and 6 which deal with the acquisition of land and the powers of the Coastguard existing in 1056. . It provides that all lands held by the Admiralty, (including buildings) in connection with the Coastguard, shall be transferred to the Office of Works, notwithstanding any provisions in leases restricting transfer.     The Parliamentary Draughtsman and the Treasury Solicitor (who advises both the Admiralty and the Office of Works) consider it will be necessary to schedule these leases by an Order in Council.Clause 1 (3).   The powers of the Admiralty compulsorily to acquire land for Coastguard stations, where necessary, are transferred to the Office of Works,Clause 2.   In time of war the Coastguard is to revert to the Admiralty who take the view that there should be express statutory sanction for this so that in common with other necessary business at the outbreak of war, the change can be made without delay.Tho Bill is now submitted for Cabinet approval.Board of Trade.18/3/24.
