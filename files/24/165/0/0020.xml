[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. JPrinted for the Cabinet.      February 192-1.&apos;SECRET.CP. 120(2-1). -T circulate tlie accompanying telegrams in continuation ol those already . circulated with CP. 55/24 and 9J./2i.OLIVIER.18th February 1921,Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated 15th February 1924.llangaclmriar&apos;8 Resolution. Course of the debate shows a growing unanimity, among all sections of. the Assembly in favour of pressing for some immediate steps leading to definite advance towards responsible government. We naturally discount the views of the more extreme Swarajists, who, in spite of the moderation exhibited by . their leader in opening the debate, now make it clear that, they really stand for immediate grant of full self-government. But, putting aside entirely extreme views of this kind, we are much impressed with the determination to secure advance shown even by the classes who were previously somewhat distrustful of its advisability.2. We anticipate that the resolution will be carried by practically unanimous vote&apos; of elected Indian members ; not because they all approve fully of its terms, but because our offer of enquiry appears to them inadequate, and, indeed, has produced some mistrust of genuineness of our intentions.   Carrying of the resolution is not matter of grave concern, unless it is followed by course of persistent obstruction aud deliberate attempts to produce deadlocks, not only in Assembly, but in the Provincial Councils, with further reactions in the shape of agitation and demonstrations which will interfere with (corrupt group) general, administration, and which may create a situation as serious as that we had to encounter in the recent past.   The reserved powers provided by constitution are, of course, sufficient to meet immediate obstruction in Legislature itself, but taking longer view, we do not think that it is in interests of India and Empire that situation should be produced which is tantamount to the breaking down of the reforms scheme.    We think, therefore, that serious efforts should be made to avoid this if it is possible to do so without any sacrifice of principle. The clue to the situation, appears to us to be mistrust in the minds even of moderate and well-disposed sections of our intention to proceed with the development of the reforms scheme.   We have anxiously reconsidered the whole position with a view to attempting some measure which will serve to dispel this mistrust.   Offer of official enquiry merely into difficulties, and defects is obviously inadequate to produce the effect, we desire.   On the other hand, we, for our part, feel that it should be made clear beyond doubt that any enquiry which we are prepared to hold should, not even present an appearance of extending the sphere of enquiry into the structure and policy of the Act.   We ourselves are unanimously of opinion that the proposal defined in the telegram dated 6th February, beginning with words &quot;my Government are now prepared&quot; and ending with &quot;for this purpose,&quot; would go far to supply all moderate and reasonable opinion with proof that wc were prepared to make a definite step forward in progressive realisation of the reforms scheme,   It could not be construed as involving any sacrifice of principle, since it is measure contemplated by Parliament itself and embodied in the Act, and would presumably have, in any case, formed a stage of advance antecedent to the appointment of statutory Commission.   It is not open to wider implications such as we have described as being incidental to announcement of enquiry already made.You will observe that our present proposals incorporate those announced in Legis-lative Assembly, and those which substantially adopted your language. The addition we now again propose is of an enquiry into the desirability and feasibility and extent of the advance to be made within the Act,, but strictly limited to remedying of complaints -and defects that will not affect general structure and policy of the Act,3. We therefore again   connneud this proposal to serious attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   We again desire to make it clear that our&apos; immediate 7092     100  2.24
concern is not with vote on, resolution, for aiinqimcement we now propose would not prevent our detent on resolution.   We have in our&quot;mind only desirability of taking measures which would serve to detacb moderate opinion from those who d^sire^ tp:-create a subsequent deadlock.   But we think it right; to inform you that we&apos; iuvve &apos;rio&quot; guarantee that these measures will have effect we desire.   Nevertheless, we are-convinced..that it would be better to make the attempt even if we ultimately fail in obtaining moderate support.   We may add that we may perhaps find it advisable to announce that we shall associate a small number of representatives from Legislature in our-enquiry.   In that event we shall insist upon the Governments representatives forming a majority of the Committee.   Please reply urgently.4. We should have preferred to have indicated to. the Assembly the further-stages-of progress to the appointment of the statutory Commission as set forth briefly in the . passage in our telegram dated 6th February, beginning:  &quot;Should these proposals &quot;-to the words &quot;under the Act had not elapsed.&quot;   We should thus make plain the course we propose, to pursue in the period between the present stage and the appointment of the statutory Commission.    We recognise, however, that this proposal may involve considerations which cannot be hurried aud would, therefore, make it impossible for you to give your assent in. the urgent answer that is required from you to enable us to make reply in the debate on Monday, and we do not,, therefore, press for reply-now; unless it should he convenient to you to make it.   The objective of these suggestions of future policy is to allay the distrust of those more moderate and thoughtful members who doubt the intentions of the British people,, and to give some prospect of stable course of policy in constitutional advance within the next few years and to oiler some inducement for co-operation and goodwill.Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, Home Department, dated 11 ih February 1924..;.&apos;tv 541.   Your telegram of loth February:   Ranga.chariar&apos;s Resolutions.   I desire to-put you fully in possession of our apprehensions as to pitfalls possibly underlying the course you advocate, which have guided the slight, divergence of our views from yours expressed in our telegram of 7th February as to line of procedure advisable.   The same,; ee\..--derations may very likely have occurred to yourself, and you may have -good -reasons to believe that we over-estimate their seriousness;1. It is common ground between us that we are not prepared to take immediate steps to.have the Government of India Act revised with a view to establishing full responsible government in India. His Majesty&apos;s Government are not in favour of such immediate advance, which, they are convinced would be unwise, nor, if they proposed it,, could they expect to retain the confidence of Parliament. Revision with a view to establishing responsible government, and the steps preparatory to revision, are provided for in the Act, which contemplated a testing and preparatory stage extending over three parliamentary periods. The essential conditions of that test are clearly defined in the statement of 20th. August 1917 and the Aet&apos;s preamble. Non-co-operation and obstruction must suspend those essential conditions and deprive Secretary of. State of necessary materials for parliamentary case for revision.-, -2; Your proposal is, as I understand it, to.promise an enquiry designed to suggest directions in which a further stage of advance may be made without a revision of the Act ; and the directions you have in mind are liberalisation of rides under sections 1,9a, 4,5a and 96b of the Act and lessening of Secretary of State&apos;s control outside the Act. My fear is that result, of such enquiry will, be to demonstrate that no advance of any substantial content in these directions is. possible within limits of present constitution, and, consequently, that commitment to make advance will prove to be commitment to reconstruct the Act as only means of securing it. Following is briefest possible summary of my reasons for this apprehension.,,,(i) It is true that section 19a purports to enable divestment of control over subjects other than transferred provincial, subjects. But Joint Committee recognised and emphasised fact that Parliamentary control cannot constitutionally be surrendered except to extent that it is transferred to Indian electorates and Legislatures. Act provides no machinery for such transfer of control in sphere of Central Government. Therefore, if Secretary of State divested himself and Parliament of right and duty to control any central subject;, Government of India would become pro tanto an autocracy freecVfrom control by, and responsibility to, Parliament, and not legally responsible
tq Indian control of, Legislature. In practice:Government of India could inirciiy j! dp-becoming&apos;subject to Indian Legislature, a position not contemplated by,Act as it. stands.(ii) Section 45,\.-There is no legal trf-constitutional bar to transfer] of further subjects in provinces. But clearly popular demands will not be satisfied save by. transfer of some such, far-reaching subjects as Police, Administration,of Justice arid&quot; Land Revenue Administration in itself a step to which Parliament&apos; would attach great importance. But if these subjects were transferred, there could be little point ill retaining any&apos;reserved subjects, La., in stopping short of what is described as lull provincial iutoam&amp;fl&apos; As you yourselves have recognised in para. 8 of your telegram of 29,th January, full provincial autonomy inevitably involves a reconstruction of Central Government, since responsibilities of Government of India in its present form could not be maintained, in respect of subjects transferred to control of pf6-vincial Legislature&apos; and Ministers; and obviously an Indian Constitution which left Government of India responsible in practice only for such matters as Customs, Posts, Railways and Indian States would have little stability as a working proposition.   &apos; &apos;(iii) Section 96b Your Government appears to have recognised (para. D of your telegram of 29th January) that delegation of further control over ail-India Services is not&apos; a practical proposition. To grant it would be inconsistent with declarations of my predecessor in Parliament, and possibly directly contrary to recommendations we are awaiting from Public Service Commission.(iv) Extension of Joint Couimittee&apos;s principle of &quot;convention&quot; seems the only-method available to lessen extra-statutory control. This is open to same difficulties as those mentioned under (i) above. ...3. Foregoing is attempt to state shortly considerations which have impressed me as of serious import. Root of matter seems to be that first stage of advance towards responsible government was so extensive as to leave in practice little room for expansion within the structure of Act and to necessitate structural alteration in constitution as means to next stage. Therefore to promise next stage now will probably involve alteration of constitution, a proceeding which Parliament is unlikely to agree to or endorse.We must bear in mind distinction between positive &quot;advance within the Act&quot; requiring Parliamentary affirmation, and further development of present constitutional tendencies of the kind which I understand Lord Peel had in mind in writing his Despatch of November 1922.4. Enquiry of three orders being contemplated (a) into demonstrated defects in working of present constitution ; (6) with a view to suggesting lines of advance within the Act, but not extending the amendment of Act itself; (c) enquiry with a view to liberalisation of the constitution, ie:, involving proposals for amendment of both rules and the Act, the difficulty which presents itself to hie is how to guard against stage (6) inevitably leading directly to stage (c). It appears impossible either to close our eyes to this probability or to pretend that something substantial is being granted not involving stage (c). It may not seem as clear to the minds of Indian politicians as it does tome that any attempt to obtain a considerable immediate advance within the Act is almost certain, for the reasons giveu above, to lead without delay to the necessity of going beyond the Act, although in fact it is possible that this is very generally understood and intended.5. Position, therefore, is that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to consider at this juncture any undertaking, direct or indirect, to initiate stage (c). They are, however, willing to leave it to you to supplement your original aunounce-lnent by a statement that the enquiry will embrace possibility of &quot;advance within Act,&quot; provided that if you did so it should be on the clear understanding, which could be announced if occasion requires, that if enquiry shows that no advance is possible without amending the constitution (as distinct from amendments of Act required to-rectify administrative imperfectionsj then the question of &quot;advance&quot; must be left as an entirely open and separate issue on which neither you nor 1 are in any degree committed.0. It should also be borne in mind that the Joint Select Committee expressed a strong opinion that no changes of substance in the list of reserved and transferred subjects should be made before the appointment of a statutory Commission. Such important changes would be the transfer of Police and Land Revenue,   ft would be
impossible for Bis Majesty&apos;s Government in present circumstances to ignore the weight of this opinion.. ,.7.. I must, now leave it ,to your. discretion to proceed as far as you may think necessary and safe, having regard to the foregoing considerations on. the lines of your proposal in regard to course (o), and I do not desire to limit you with regard to the mode of your enquiry or constitution of a Committee for that purpose.1. should be glad if an opportunity could be found, to express the great concern with which, His .IMajesty&apos;s Government have noted the indications of distrust on the part, of the advocates for constitutional reform of the good faith of His Majesty&apos;s Government in their attitude towards constitutional, progress. His Majesty&apos;s Goveru-ment are sincerely convinced that the only hope for a satisfactory solution of the problems of Indian government lies in pursuance of the policy adopted in the Government of India Act and set forth, in its preamble. They associate themselves with the Indian party of constitutional progress towards, responsible government institutions, but they believe that this aim can only he realised if that party will co-operate with the Government in enabling the Act of 1919 to he administered as efficiently as possible in the interests of good government.   ,
