to the secretary of the ministry of labour. Sib,I have the honour to forward a Report by the Director of Statistics upon an enquiry which has been made, in accordance with your instructions, into the personal circumstances and industrial history of ten thousand claimants&apos; to unemployment benefit.Humbert Wolfe.2.1st February, 1924.
PREFATORY NOTE.To the Principal Assistant-Secretary   (General Department) of the Ministry of Labour.Sir,I have the honour to present a Report upon an enquiry made early in November, 1923, into the personal circumstances and industrial history of ten thousand claimants to unemployment benefit selected in such a way as to constitute as nearly :as possible a representative sample of the whole body of claimants.Tlie main value of such an enquiry must necessarily lie in its detail; and the principal utility of the present analysis must be rather in affording information upon specific questions than in revealing new and unsuspected features of the unemployment or insurance situation. None the less the enquiry has disclosed some features of general interest which may usefully be summarised.It should be emphasised at the outset that the enquiry relates strictly to claimants to unemployment benefit. Since disqualification-cation for benefit, exhaustion, etc., varies in. its incidence accord-ing to age and personal circumstances, caution should be observed in drawing from the results of the analysis conclusions as to the composition of &quot; the unemployed.&quot; It should also be noted that because females in industry are in general much younger than males in. industry the disqualifications affecting young persons fall with greater frequency upon females and there are likely to be proportionately more unemployed insured females who do not figure among claimants to benefit than is the case with males.Degree of Employ ability.The Employment Exchange managers or their deputies who personally interviewed these ten thousand claimants were asked to place each person in one of several specified categories of &quot; employ ability.&quot; The four most important of these categories were lettered and defined as follows : -A. Persons who; in normal times, would usually be in steadyemployment.B. Persons who, though not usually in steady employment,would, in normal times, obtain a fair amount of employment.C. Persons who would not in normal times obtain a iairamount of employment, but who were not considered .  to be &quot; verging on the unemployable.&quot;D. Persons who&apos;were considered to be &quot; verging on theunemployable.&quot; 45981 a 2
The analysis of the schedules shows that, in the opinion of in-terviewing officers, 665 per cent, of all the males interviewed, and 73&apos;5 per cent, of all the females, were persons who in normal times would usually be in steady employment; while only 3&apos;6 per cent, of the males and 2&quot;0 per cent, of the females were regarded as &quot; verging on the unemployable.&apos;&apos; Categories A and B taken together (persons who in normal times would be either steadily or at least fairly well employed), account for 89&apos;4 per cent, of the men and 88&apos;2 per cent, of the women. It will not be overlooked, in comparing the proportions for men and women, that female claimants are in general much younger than male claimants.The analysis shows that the number of those men and. women who were considered to be &quot; verging on the unemployable &quot; is in great part made up of elderly or aged persons. Over half the men placed in this category, and over one-third of the women, were aged 60 years and over. It will also be remarked that a heavy proportion of those classed as &apos;&apos; verging on the unemploy-able &apos;&apos; suffered from poor physique, poor health, or some manifest physical defect.It should be observed that1 the men and women placed in Category D are not &apos;&apos; unemployable &apos;&apos; but &apos;&apos; verging on the unemployable.&quot; If they were unemployable they would be pre-cluded by the provisions of the Act from receiving benefit. That they are not &apos;&apos; unemployable &apos;&apos; in the strict sense of the word is borne out by an examination of their employment records, which serves to show that they have had, as a class, a fair amount of recent employment, though less employment, either absolutely or in relation to benefit drawn, than any of the other classes.Age of Claimants.An examination of the age distribution, of claimants interviewed shows that less than half the male claimants were under, 35 but four-fifths of the female claimants were under that age. The largest number of men and of women of any one age are found in the age group 20 to 24. The heaviest proportions of men figuring among claimants to benefit, relative to the numbers of workers in the population generally, is in the age group 20 to 24 and in the age group 55 and over. In the case of women the heaviest pro-portion is found in the age group 18 to 24. . Youths of from 16 to 19 and girls of 16 and 17 are much more lightly represented among the claimants than among industrial workers generally.Marital State.Analysis of the marital state of the claimants interviewed shows thai &quot;about two-fifths of all the men were single and three-fifths ^either married or.widowed. Of the men aged 20 to 24.about four-fifths were single. Tlwo-thirds of all the women were single. Of the women aged 20 to 24 about three-quarters were single and one-quarter married or widowed.
Physique and Health.The interviewing officers recorded in each case their impressions of the claimant&apos;s physique and apparent health. The results of their classification may be conveniently summarised as follows : Physique. Health.Good.    Fair.    Poor. Good.    Fair. Poor.Males      ......    67&apos;5     27-9       4-6 76-0     20-3 3-7Females   ......    74&apos;0     23-1       2-9 81-6     16-0 2-4When physique is considered in relation to the age of claimants it appears that, taking all claimants together, (1) the physique of boys and girls was regarded as rather better, but not markedly better, than that of adults in early and middle years, (2) between the ages of 18 and 44 the proportions of &quot; good,&quot; &quot; fair &quot; and &quot; poor &quot; vary very little, (3) physique falls off steadily from tha age of 45 onwards, and (4) at 60 and over less than half the claimants, whether men or women, are designated as of &quot; good physique.&apos;&apos; The analysis shows that while an insignificant pro-portion of the best class of workpeople (those placed in Cate-gory A) were of poor physique over.two-fifths of those regarded as &quot; verging on the unemployable,&quot; whether men or women, were of that condition.Examination of apparent state of health in relation to age shows that (1) the health of boys under 18 was judged, to be better, but not markedly better, than the health of young men from 18 to 24, (2) there was no difference between the health of girls&apos; under 18 and young women of from 18 to 20, (3) the health of girls and young women up to 20 years of age was better than that of older women, (4) the health of claimants, whether men or women, fell off steadily from the age of 45 onwards, and (5) at the age of .60 and over little more than half the claimants were described as of &quot; good &quot; health, while about 1 in 10 were considered to be of &quot; poor &quot; health. As in the case of the corresponding table for physique an insignificant proportion of workpeople of the &apos;&apos; most employable &quot; class were regarded as of poor health, while those classed as &quot; verging on the unemployable &quot; were in great part suffering from either poor or only fair health.Physical Dejects.Interviewing officers were asked to state whether the person interviewed had any apparent physical defect and, if so, to state its nature. The analysis shows that 78&apos;2 per cent, of the males and 87&apos;6 per cent, of the females were classed as having no apparent physical defect. The defects most frequently recorded are bad eyesight, deafness, lameness, and&apos; amputation. Ex-Mnined in relation to age, the returns show that (1) among the younger claimants apparent physical defects were rather less 45084 &apos; a 3
eprevalent among females than among males, (2) between the ages of 25 and 49 apparent physical defects were considerably less . prevalent among * the women than among the men, (3) among persons of 60 and over more than one-third of the men and nearly one-half of the women had some kind of apparent physical defect, (4) amputation and lameness occurred much more frequently among the men than among the women, and occurred principally among men who had been of military service age at the time of the war, (5) deafness was nearly three times as prevalent among men as among women, and (6) bad eyesight was rather more prevalent among women than men, occurring with particular frequency after the age of 54. As in the case of physique.and health the analysis, shows that the proportion of persons with&apos; no physical defects is highest in the case of those classified as &apos;&apos; who in normal times would be usually in steady -employment &quot;and lowest in the case of persons &quot; verging on the unemployable.&quot; In the case of men the persons placed in Category C (&quot; persons who would not in normal times obtain a fair amount of employment but who are not considered to be .&apos; verging on the unemployable&apos; &quot;) included a large proportion of men who were lame, maimed and aged, and who suffered from miscellaneous physical defects.Assessment of &quot; Employability.&quot; IFrom what appears above it may be inferred that interviewing officers, in forming their opinions as to the category of employ-ability into which claimants should be placed, were influenced very largely by apparent or disclosed physical condition. Cases of bad physique, bad health, and physical defect appear very rarely among those placed in the highest category of employability and very commonly among those placed in the- lowest. It is possible that some of those placed in the category &quot; verging on unemploy-able &quot; had qualities of -character or skill which would make them, despite their physical defects, desirable workpeople in special employment; it may be on the other hand that some of those placed in the highest category had moral or mental failings, which would lead to their early discharge from any employment.Age of Leaving School, Types of School Attended, and age of Starting Work.All claimants who were under the age of 30 were interrogated as to the age at which they left school, the type of school they had last attended, and the age at which they started work. The analysis shows that 94&apos;0 per cent, of the boys and young men and 91&apos;3 per cent, of the girls and young women left school at or under the age of 14, that 3&apos;5 per cent, and 5&apos;4 per cent, respec-tively left school at&apos;the age of 15, and-that the rest left school &quot;at various ages up to 18. It further shows that 90&apos;7 per cent, of the boys and young men and 66&apos;8 per cent, of the girls and young
women started woi-k at or under the age of 14, while oi per cent, and 15-7 per cent, respectively started work at 15. It will be ob-served that for males the numbers and proportions of those who &apos; started work at or under 14 years of age are not very different from the numbers and proportions of those who&apos; left school at those ages. The obtaining of employment lags a little behind the leaving of school, but the boys and young men interviewed may be said to have entered employment of some kind almost immediately they left school. With girls and young women the numbers differ considerably and the inference is that girls who left school at 14 or under did not in general enter employment until some time afterwards.The analysis of the record of type of school attended shows that 5&apos;5 per cent, of the boys and young men under 30, and 7&quot;4 per cent., of&apos; the girls and young women under 30, bad attended secondary schools; the rest had attended only elementary schools.Apprenticeship and Training.Information was sought of all claimants interviewed as to &apos; whether they had been apprenticed or trained. The analysis of these particulars shows that of the males interviewed 25&apos;9 per cent, were stated to have been apprenticed, 25&apos;3 per cent, trained, and 48&apos;8 per cent, neither apprenticed nor trained ; while of the females only 153 per cent, claimed apprenticeship, but 49&apos;2 per cent, claimed to have had some training, and 35&quot;5 per cent, were stated to have been neither apprenticed nor trained. It may be remarked that &quot; training &quot; in the case of a woman often means something more meagre or casual than in the case of a man.Number of Dependants.Questions were asked of claimants interviewed as to the number of persons dependent upon them. Distinction was made in the reports between adults and children; also between those depen-dants covered by Dependants&apos; Benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and those not so covered. Taking first the records as to persons stated to be dependent on claimants, whether covered by Dependants&apos; Benefit or not, it is seen that of the male&apos; claimants interviewed 42&apos;9 per cent, were stated to have no one dependent on them, and 57T per cent, to-have dependants, either adults or children or both. The average number of persons stated to be dependent upon those male claimants who had dependants was 2-7 per claimant. Of the female claimants inter-viewed 89-9 per cent, were stated to have no one dependent on them&apos;, and 10&apos;1 per cent, to have dependants, adults or children or both. In these cases the average number of dependants was 17 per claimant. ,
The particulars concerning dependants in respect of whom Dependants&apos; Benefit was being received were entered on the schedules from Employment Exchange records. Of the males interviewed 52&apos;7 per cent, had no dependants in respect of whom they were drawing Dependants&apos; Benefit and 47-8 per cent, had such dependants. Of the males who were drawing Dependants&apos; Benefit 35&apos;2 per cent, were receiving benefit in respect of wife or housekeeper only, 6 per cent, in respect of child or children only, and 58&apos;8 per cent, in respect of an adult with one or more children. Of every 100 male claimants interviewed 47 had dependants comprising 45 dependent adults and 70 dependent children:. Of the females only 1&apos;5 per cent, were drawing benefit in respect of dependants.Size oj Dependent Families.A further analysis was made to ascertain the size of the depen-dent families of those who were drawing Dependants&apos; Benefit. Only children in respect of whom Dependants&apos; Benefit was being paid were taken into account in this computation. The analysis shows that 35&apos;9 per cent, of the men with dependent children were drawing benefit, in respect of one child only, 28&apos;8 per cent, in respect of two children, 17&apos;1 per cent, in respect of three children, and 18&apos;2 per cent, in respect of four or more children. Of the women receiving Dependants&apos; Benefit in respect of children, 41&apos;0 per cent, were drawing benefit in respect of one child, 50&apos;0 per cent, in respect of two children, and 9&apos;0 per cent, in respect of three or more children.Contributions and Benefit.Particulars of the contributions paid and benefit drwvn by each claimant were obtained from Insurance Records. The average number of contributions paid by the males interviewed was 176 and the average number of days&apos;&apos; benefit drawn by them was 308. For females the figures are 104 and 132. The number of days&apos; benefit drawn per contribution paid was, therefore, for males 1&apos;75 and for females 1&apos;27. Among males the least benefit relative to contributions had been drawn, by boys under 18 and the most by men of 20 to 29 years of age. Among females the least benefit relative to contributions paid had been drawn by girls and young women under 21, and the most by women over 60. In considering the small amount of benefit received, relative to contributions paid, in the case of young persons it should be remembered that the conditions attaching to the receipt of un-covenanted benefit exclude young persons who may reasonably look to parents or relatives for support.It will be observed that there is in the cose of both sexes a progressive increase in the benefit drawn relative to contributions paid as the degree of &quot;employability falls.   Ear every contribution
paid, the males assigned to Category A had drawn 1&apos;53 days&apos; benefit; Category B, 2&apos;27 days&apos;; Category C, 262 days&apos;; and Category D 2&apos;81 days&apos;. For females the corresponding figures are: Category A, 122 days&apos; benefit; Category B, l-56 days&apos;; Category C, 1&apos;59 days&apos; and Category D, 2&apos;56 days&apos;.When First Insured against Unemployment.In considering the amount of benefit drawn in relation to con-tributions paid it was thought desirable to distinguish between persons who entered insurance in the earlier and in more recent years. Of the males interviewed, 25&apos;3 per cent, entered under the 1911 Act,, 27&apos;0 per cent; under the 1916 Act, and .47&apos;7 per cent, under the 1920 Act. Of thej females 1&apos;7 per cent, entered under the 1911 Act, 147 per cent, under the 1916 Act, and 83&apos;6-per cent, under the 1920 Act.In pages 64 to 77 of the Report the subsequent Insurance history of the group of persons who entered insurance in each insurance year from 1912-13 is traced.. It is there shown thai absence from industry on military service has reduced the number of contributions subsequently paid by the younger men who entered insurance under the 1911 Act, and thereby increased their ratio of benefit drawn to contributions paid, and that in general it is the fewer contributions paid and not the more days&apos; benefit drawn which causes the benefit per contribution to vary widely. It is also shown that, of those claimants interviewed who entered insurance in. .1920-21, the subsequent industrial history of the younger men has been better than that of the older. For example, the men of 20 to 24 who entered in 1920-21 have since drawn 2&apos;6 days&apos; benefit per contribution paid while the men of 45 onwards i have drawn 3&apos;7 days&apos;. Some 40 per cent, of those claimants j interviewed, who entered insurance in 1921-22 and 1922-23 were at the time of entry under 18 years of age and the ratio for these claimants was approximately only 12 days&apos; benefit per contri-bution paid, but in their case the conditions attaching to the receipt of uncovenanted benefit have restricted the amount of benefit drawn relative to contributions paid.The One-in-Six Rule.I Under the 1920 Act an insured person might claim, provided I he was not disqualified on other grounds, one week&apos;s benefit for every six contributions paid. It has been regarded as desirable to ascertain what proportion of the claimants had drawn more benefit than they would have been able to draw had there been no relaxation of the one-in-six rule and what proportion! had drawn benefit in excess thereof. The analysis shows that 70&apos;8 per cent, of the males and 51&apos;8 per cent, of the females had drawn more benefit than they would have been entitled to under the one-
in-six rule, while only 29&apos;2 per cent, of the males and 48&apos;8 per cent, of the females had drawn benefit within the provisions of that rule had it been in force throughout.The largest proportion of male claimants who exceeded the -amount of benefit which tho one-in-six rule would have allowed ^occurs among men of 60 and over (753 per cent.), and among ithose aged 25 to 29 (74&apos;8 per cent.),- while the lowest propor-iioos occurs among juveniles under 18 (49&apos;6 per cent.), and :among young&apos;men of 18 and 19 (64&apos;8 per cent.)&apos;. Among females ihe lowest proportion is found among young women of 18 or 19 years of age (39&apos;5 per cent.), and the largest among women over 60 (7T8 percent.).Considered by categories the analysis shows that of the males assigned to Category A (persons who in normal times would usually be in steady employment) only 65&apos;9 per cent, had drawn benefit in excess of what the one-in-six rule would have allowed, while 87&apos;8 per cent, of those in Category D (persons verging on the unemployable) had drawn benefit in excess of the maximum which that rule would have allowed. In the case of females the corresponding proportions are 49&apos;0 per cent, for Category A, and 81&apos;3 per cent, for Category D.Poor Law Relief.Information was obtained in every case from the Poor Law Authorities as to whether the claimant was in receipt of Poor Law Eelief, and, if so, at what weekly rate. . The analysis of this information shows that 10&apos;3 per cent, of the males, and only 0&apos;8 per cent, of the females, were in receipt of Poor Eelief. The age groups showing the heaviest proportion of males in receipt of Poor Eelief are 30 to 34 (207 per cent.), 35 to 44 (17&apos;0 per cent.) and 25 to 29 (13&apos;3 per cent.). In the case of females the age group showing the heaviest proportion is that of women from 45 to 54 years of age (4&apos;0 per cent.).An examination of the amounts received in U.I. Benefit and Poor Eelief shows that the cases which most frequently occur among males in receipt of Poor Eelief over and above their unem-ployment benefit are of men drawing from 20s. to 24s. a week in benefit (which means^men with a dependent wife, or with wife and from one to four&apos; dependent children) and in receipt also of Poor Eelief ranging from 2s. del: to 12s. Qd. per week. The largest combined amounts paid from the two sources were to men with a wife and from three to seven children who were in receipt of sums ranging from about 56s. to about 65s. per week.Eleven of the 14 women who were in receipt of Poor Eelief were drawing unemployment benefit in respect of themselves only&apos; and, in addition, weekly sums ranging from 5s. to 15s. from the Poor Law authorities. There is one girl under 18 who was in receipt of an additional sum of less tha.n 5s. in Poor. Relief.
Contributions in previous 122 weeks.Finally, am attempt has been made to ascertain from the returns how long claimants had been unemployed during the 122 weeks preceding the date (November 5th to 10th, 1923), on which the enquiry was made. . For this purpose it was necessary to confine the analysis to those persons who were in insurance prior to the beginning of the 1921-22 insurance year, that is to say, persons who were in insurance before July 4th, 1921. The enquiry has proceeded along the lines of ascertaining how many contributions these claimants had paid since that date. It should be understood that the payment of a contribution in respect of a particular week does not necessarily mean that the claimant, was in employment during the whole of that week : a stamp wilt iti some cases represent only one day:s or half-day&apos;s employment in the week. The analysis cannot therefore be read as meaning; that the claimants had during these 122 weeks as many full. week-&apos;e employment as they had. numbers of contributions in their&apos; books, but it is probable that taking the claimants as a whole such a reading would not give a very material overstatement.The analysis shows that 5&quot;0 percent, of the claimants who.had entered insurance prior to July 4th, 1921, had had no insured employment whatever since that date. Considered by categories it will be seen that whilst only 3&apos;6 per cent, of those placed in Category A had had no insured employment during the period, 60 per cent, of those in Category B, 13-2 per cent, of those in Category C and 17-0 per cent, of those in Category D were in that position.If the period of 122 weeks be divided roughly into four portions the analysis indicates that over the whole period 28 6 per cent, of these- males had done some insured work in from .0 to 29 weeks, 263 per cent, had done some insured work in from 30 to 59 weeks, 268 per cent, had done some insured work in from 60 to 89 of the weeks, and 19&apos;3 per cent, had done some insured work in from 90 to 122 weeks.Considered by age groups the analysis shows that the propor-tion of youths under 20 who had had little employment in the period is relatively small while the proportion of men of 60 and over who had had no insured employment during the period is nearlv twice as great as in the case of persons in the other age groups.Reliability of sample.An enquiry into the personal circumstances and industrial history of claimants to U.I. Benefit based upon the examination of only one out of every hundred cases might seem to rest upon altogether too slender a basis to allow of any reliance being placed upon its results. The sample was taken, however, with the greatest care, and every practicable precaution was observed to ensure that the sample should be evenly spread, without bias of any kind, over the whole of the claimants.

64SREPORTon an investigation into the  personal  circumstances and industrial history of10,000 CLAIMANTS TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT. November 5th to 10th, 1923.Purpose and Scale of Investigation.For the purpose of getting a general picture of the classes of persons who make up the numbers of claimants to unemploy-raent benefit an investigation was made in the early part of November, 1923, into the personal circumstances and industrial history of 10,000 individuals selected from among the whole number of claimants.The selection was made in such a manner as to ensure that, so far as practicable, the 10,000 individuals should be a represen-tative sample of the whole body of claimants. The enquiry was spiead over the whole of the 413 Employment Exchanges in Great Britain (not Northern Ireland), but was not extended to Branch Offices. The total number of claimants at all Local Offices (including Branch Offices) in the early part of November was 1,160,939. The number at Employment Exchanges (not including Branch Offices), was 1,053,752, of whom 833,875 were men, 16,028 boys-, 191,506 women, and 12,343 girls. The number actually reported upon was 9,997, comprising 7,981 men, 252 boys, 1,617 women, and 147 girls. The sample consists therefore of 0&apos;0096 per cent, of the men claimants, 0&apos;0157 per cent, of the boys, 0&apos;0084 per cent, of the women, and 0&apos;0119 per cent, of the girls. If it should be desired to obtain from the figures given in the text and tables a rough idea of the actual numbers represented by the sample numbers the figures for men should bo multiplied by 104, those for boys by 64,&apos; those for women by 118, and those for girls by 84.The procedure followed as regards the allocation of the work of the enquiry was to require from each Exchange manager a detailed report concerning a specified number of individuals on his register. This number was fixed, on the average, roughly in the proportion of 1 to 100. to the total number of claimants at that Exchange; but departures from this ratio were necessary in many cases in order that an undue amount of work might not be thrown on the managers of the largest Exchanges, and that the reports might, nevertheless, be distributed over the whole country.
The procedure adopted for the selection of the individuals to be interviewed was to require managers to &quot; tab &quot; every 100th claim (the 100 being-subject to the above-mentioned departures) in their.&quot; Live Claims &quot; files. Claims are kept in the files in occupation order, and in order that there should not be an undue preponderance of any one occupation among the persons selected the selection of the first claim to be &quot; tabbed &quot; was laid down for each Exchange : the starting point being thus made to vary from Exchange to Exchange, This procedure was followed separately for men, women, boys and girls.Interviewing of Selected Claimants.Each of these &quot; tabbed &quot; claims.was regarded as marking the centre of a small group of claims each of which should furnish one claimant. Arrangements were made that the first person in any group coming to the Exchange should be interviewed. This group arrangement was adopted in order to ensure that the work.of interviewing should not be held up by the non-appearance of a selected candidate. The interviewing of men and boys was conducted (except in very rare cases) by the manager himself, and that of women and girls was done by the senior woman officer.Particulars Recorded.Managers were supplied with schedules setting out the informa-tion to be recorded concerning the interviewed claimant, arranged under 34 heads. The enquiries made were designedly limited to matters which were readily ascertainable from the records or which did not involve invidious questioning, and the manner of entering the information on the schedules bad necessarily to be prescribed in a form which would admit of statistical analysis. Where practicable, the required information was obtained from documents already in the possession of the Exchange and from the records of Local Authorities, while information concerning contributions paid and benefit received in past years was obtained by consulting the Ledger Accounts at the Claims and Records Office, Kew. Information on other items was obtained from the claimant personally. This latter information was given under a pledge that particulars concerning individuals would not be dis-closed and that the information would be used solely for the preparation of general statistics and reports. For each claimant a schedule was filled in by the Exchange manager and on November 10th the schedules were forwarded to the Ministry of Labour for analysis. The schedule is reproduced on pages 89-90.Qualifications.In drawing inferences from the analysis set out in the Report and in the accompanying&apos; tables, it should be borne in mind that the enquiry related, strictly to persons with claims-to benefit in the Live Claims Files at Employment Exchanges at the date in question.   Persons whose claims to benefit Sad been disallowed
or terminated are not included in the Enquiry. The incidence of qualification, disqualification, disallowance, exhaustion, &amp;c, varies as between the sexes and over the various age-groups; and if corresponding particulars of all unemployed insured persons, whether claimants or non-claimants, could be obtained,, they would on analysis show a distribution of age and. other&apos; characteristics different from that, reflected in the present analysis. For these reasons it will be obvious that caution must be observed in drawing, from the results of this analysis, conclusions as to the personal circumstances and industrial history of &quot; the unemployed.&quot;RESULTS OP THE ENQUIRY.The main analysis of the principal particulars given in the returns is presented in Tables I and&apos; II (pages 50 and 51). Sub-analyses of these particulars are given in Tables III to XIV (pages 52 to 63). Information as to, benefit and contributions I according to year of entry into insurance is given in Tables XV to XXIV (pages 64 to 79). In the text which follows per-centages and ratios are in general used instead of absolute numbers as bringing out more clearly the significance of the data.\Degree of Envploijability.Managers were asked to state, from their knowledge or im-pressions, into which of six specified categories of employability or unemployability the claimant should be placed. The object of this was to show how many of the claimants were workpeople of the best type, how many were verging on the unemployable, and in what manner the remainder ranged between these two ex-tremes. It was necessary to specify and define the categories in order that the information might be treated statistically.The categories adopted for the purpose of this analysis were as follows : A. Persons who, in normal times, would usually be in steady i . employment.i B. Persons who, though not usually in steady employment, would, in normal times, obtain a fair amount of employment.C. Persons who would not in normal times obtain a fairamount of employment,- but who were not considered, to be &quot; verging on the unemployable.&quot;D. Persons who were considered to be &quot; verging on the I unemployable.&quot;I E. Persons who left, school during or since the war, and in I . consequence of abnormal conditions have been unableI to get a footing in regular industry,j P. Persons who cannot be placed in any of the above j categories.
it)Managers were instructed- that by &quot; unemployable &quot; was meant, for the purpose of this enquiry, &quot; a person whose industrial value is so low that an employer would never select him for a job unless no other applicant was available and the work had to be done at once, i.e., that an employer would only engage him in the last resort, if at all.&quot; Attention may be called to the fact that persons placed in category D are not deemed; &quot; unem-ployable &quot; but &quot; verging on the unemployable.&quot; Since it is a statutory condition that a claimant to receive benefit must be capable of work &apos;&apos; no unemployable in the strict sense of the word could be among the claimants. Managers were also given examples of the types of claimants who would fall into the non-descript category F; these being &apos;&apos; a person whose main occupa-tion up to the war had been work on his own account &quot; and &quot; a man who had served as a professional soldier, sailor, &amp;c, for some years in His Majesty&apos;s Forces.&quot;. The results of this classification of claimants under various categories of employ ability are shown in the following table, which summarises and reduces to percentages the figures embodied in Tables III to XIV.Numbers and Proportions of the Men, Boys, Women and Girls interviewed&apos; who were assigned to the several classes of &quot; Employability.&quot;Categories of &apos; Employability.

In general the age was ascertained by personal interrogation, but in some cases the age appearing on the claim form was entered upon the schedule and in certain of these cases the age so recorded would be the age of the claimant at the time when the claim was made. &apos; This explains the one or two instances of obvious error as, for example, where a boy under 18 is shown as having entered insurance before July 31st, 1920.  These enors are rare and do not sensibly affect the results.

The ratios which are given in the following table for the 1921 Census have been compiled from provisional figures supplied by the Eegistrars-Generalof England and Wales and of Scotland, and in -their compilation certain allowances have had to be made.%0-7 3-3 4-0 1-3 6-8 4-3 7-7 4-0 7-7
The age grouping in the Census analysis as at present available joes not exactly correspond with the grouping adopted for the&apos; purpose of this enquiry and therefore certain of the age groups have had to be combined. In considering this comparison it should be borne in mind that the Census figures cover not only insured workpeople but also persons occupied in agriculture and domestic service and in non-manual occupations remunerated at over aG250 per annum. They also include all those employees of local authorities, railways, and other public utility undertakings who are excepted owing to the terms of their employment from the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts. The com-parison is as follows : Comparison of Age Distribution of Claimants Interviewed with Age Distribution of Occupied Persons in England and Wales as ascertained at the 1921 Census.	Males.

In the age group 20 to 24, however, the position changes and the proportion of claimants in this age-group is considerably heavier than the proportion of persons within those ages in the occupied population as a whole. In the age-group 25 to 34, the proportions roughly correspond. In the next age-group the claimants are proportionately fewer; in the next they again roughly correspond. Finally, among males of 55 years and over there is again a heavier proportion of claimants than&apos; among persons of those ages in the 1921 occupied population.In the case of females the same, though not so considerable a discrepancy between proportions of claimants and occupied persons, will be observed among girls under 18.  Among women
of 18 to 34 the proportion of claimants is substantially heavier than the proportion of occupied females of those ages in 1921. From the age of 35 and onwards females appear in smaller-proportions among claimants than they do among the occupied population1 generally.The comparative lowness in the proportion of boy and girl claimants disclosed in the table above may to some extent reflect better employment among that class than among older persons, but it should be remembered throughout that because of the heavier incidence of disqualification for uncovenanted benefit upon young people a less than average proportion of unemployed young people will be represented inl the live claims files at employment exchanges. The disproportionate numbers of young men aged 20-24 appearing as claimants without doubt reflects in part the greater difficulties young men of these ages have had in settling down into regular employment, but in1 this connection it may be remarked that the same disproportion in ihe numbers of claimants relative to occupied persons was observed before the war in respect of males covered by the 1911 Act. The com-parative lowness in the proportion of women claimants over 35 may be attributed partly to a lower rate of unemployment among such women and partly to the heavier incidence of disqualifica-tion for uncovenanted benefit on the ground of carrying out domestic duties and of support by husband or family.In considering the analyses set out in this Report it should be kept in mind that disqualification for the receipt of uncove-nanted benefit falls heaviest upon young persons who have few contributions to their credit and who are residing with parents or relatives to whom they may reasonably look for support during unemployment; and that since the females who are! insured against unemployment are in general much. younger than the males a larger proportion of them are subject to these limiting conditions than is the case with males.The effect of the war and the subsequent abnormal conditions on the industrial careers of boys and girls who left school during or since the war is seen from the above tables. Of all the boys of 16 and 17, 21&apos;4 per cent, were considered to- have been unable for this reason to get a footing in regular industry. Of the youths of 18 and 19, 321 per-cent, are placed in this category, as are also 31&apos;7 per cent, of those whose ages-range from 20 to 24. For girls the corresponding percentages are 13&apos;6, 14&apos;2 and 5&apos;6.It will be seen that the number of those men and women who were considered to be &quot; verging on the unemployable &quot; is in great part made up of elderly or aged persons. Of the males relegated to this category 56&quot;9 per cent., and of the females 34&quot;4 per cent., were aged 60 years and over. Only 16-3 of the males, and 43-8 per cent, of the females, were under 45. It will also be shown later that a heavy proportion of those classed as &quot; verging on the unemployable &quot; suffered from some physical infirmity.

Of the females 66&apos;4 per cent, were single, 28&apos;3 per cent, were married, and 5&apos;3 per cent, were widowed. Attention may be directed to the males aged 20 to 24, who constitute 16-3 per cent, of the whole number of male claimants. Of these 80&apos;0 per cent, were single men. Of the women in the same age group, who form just over a quarter of the female claimants, 77&apos;5 per cent, were unmarried.
The&apos; figures do not otherwise call for comment, but it may be remarked that use was made of this table to test the reliability of the sample of one in a hundred claimants taken on this occasion by comparing the age and marital state distribution as shown by that sample with the distribution of the same characteristics as shown by a sample of one in every three claimants taken some nine months earlier. The results of that comparison for men and women are shown in Tables XXV and XXVI on pages 80-81. It will be observed that the correspondence is remarkably close. When allowance is made for the probability that between the two dates some change will have occurred in the actual composi-tion of the unemployed the table may be taken as weighty evidence that cases forming the one-in-a-hundred sample taken for the present investigation were sufficiently representative to allow of general conclusions being drawn from their analysis. Dependence on the trustworthiness of the samples should&apos; not, however, be carried too far. Where, sub-analyses yield very small numbers of persons, say from 1 to 10, under any one head, a larger margin of possible error in the percentages should&apos; be allowed than is necessary where larger numbers are concerned. Physique of Claimants.Interviewing officers were asked to state whether in their judg-ment the physique of the claimant was &quot; good,&quot; &quot; fair,&quot; or &quot; poor.&quot; They were instructed that on this point they must rely on their own observation and no questions must be put to the claimant.Of all the males reported upon, 67&apos;5. per cent, were reported &quot; good,&quot; 27&apos;9 per cent. &quot; fair,&quot; and 4&apos;6 per cent. &quot; poor.&quot; Of all the females reported upon 74&apos;0 per cent, were reported &quot; good,&quot; 231 per cent. &quot; fair,&quot; and 2&apos;9 per cent. &quot; poor.&quot;The distribution of &quot; good,&quot; &quot; fair &quot; and &quot; poor &quot; physique over the various age groups may be seen from the percentage table which follows : Proportion of Persons in each Age Group considered &apos;&apos; Good,&quot; &quot; Fair &quot; and &quot; Poor &quot; in Physique.

Taking all claimants together, the table shows (1) that the, physique of boys and girls was regarded as rather better, but not markedly better, than that of the younger adults, (2) that between the ages of 18 and 44 the proportions of &quot;good,&quot; &quot; fair &quot; and &quot; poor &quot; vary very little, (3) that the physique falls off steadily from the age of 45 onwards, and (4) that at 60 and over less than half the claimants, whether men or women, are designated as of &quot; good &quot; physique.An examination of the main tables appended to the Report shows that physique has largely influenced the examining officers&apos; opinions as to employability. The following table demonstrates this:-Proportion of Persons in each Category of Employability con-sidered to be &quot; Good,&quot; &quot;.

These are all within the ages 16 to 24, and a comparison of their physique with the average physique of all claimants within those ages suggests itself.Taking all claimants of ages 16 to 24 in all the categories, those recorded as of &quot; good &quot; physique are, among the males, 757 per cent., and among the females, 77&apos;4 per cent. The young people who were unable, owing to war and after-war circumstances, to get a footing in regular industry, were therefore rated as being of appreciably lower physique than the average; the number regarded as of &quot; good &quot; physique being 68&apos;9 per cent, in the case of males and 727 per cent, in the case of females,
Health of Claimants.Interviewing officers were required to state whether the health of the person interviewed appeared to be &quot; good,&quot; &quot; fair &quot; or &quot; poor.&quot; They were instructed that if the claimant&apos;s appear-ance gave a clear indication of his state of health no question need be put specifically on the point, but that otherwise he should be interrogated. Such a basis of appraisement cannot be held to be wholly satisfactory, but the need for avoiding what might seem invidious questioning was regarded as outweighing the greater accuracy such questioning might afford, and while it was clear that errors would be made in individual cases it was hoped that the error in the gross results would not be considerable.Appraised in this manner 76&apos;0 per cent, of the males were described as &quot; good &quot; in health, 20&apos;3 per cent, as &quot; fair,&quot; and 3:7 per cent, as &quot; poor &quot; ; while of the females 8T6 per cent, were described as &quot; good,&apos;&quot; 16&apos;0 per cent, as &quot; fair,&quot; and 2&apos; per cent, as &quot; poor.&quot;The following table shows the distribution of &quot; good,&quot; &quot; fair &quot; and &quot; poor &quot; health over the various age groups : Proportion of the Persons in each age group considered &quot; Good,&quot; &quot; Fair &quot; and &quot; Poor &quot; in health.

The relation of health to &quot; employability &quot; will be seen from the following table : Proportion of Persons in each Category of Employability considered to be &quot; Good,&quot; &quot; Fair&quot; and &quot; Poor &quot; Health.Categories of Employability.

The figures in the above table give, for young persons in category E, 85&apos;9 per cent, in &quot; good &quot; health for males and 80&apos;7 per cent, for females. The young people in category E come out, therefore, rather worse than the average among claimants of those ages in all categories. In this respect the classification according to health is much the same as that according to physique already noticed.Physical Defects.Interviewing officers were asked to state whether the person interviewed had any apparent physical defect and, if so, to state its nature. They were instructed that if the claimants appearance gave a clear indication of any or no physical defects no question on the point need be specifically put to him, but that otherwise he should be interrogated.Of the total number of males of all ages reported upon, 78&apos;2 per cent, were classed as having no apparent physical defect, 37 per cent, were classed under &quot; deaf,&quot; 7&apos;4 per cent, under &quot; bad eyesight,&quot; 2&apos;4 per cent, under &quot; lame,&quot; T6 per cent, under &quot; amputation,&quot; 0&apos;8 per cent, under &quot; infirmity due to old
age &quot; and 5&apos;9 per cent, as having miscellaneous other physical defects. Of the whole number of females of all agas reported upon 87&apos;6 per cent, were classed as haying no apparent physical defect, T4 per cent, were classed under &quot; deaf,&quot; 8&apos;0 per cent, under &quot; bad eyesight,&quot; 0&apos;5 per cent; under &quot; lame,&quot; 0&apos;1 per cent, under &quot; infirmity due to old age &quot; and 2&apos;4 per cent, as having miscellaneous other physical defects.It will be remarked that among the claimants to benefit apparent physical defects were much less frequent among the women than among the men; but here again it is wTell to remember that women claimants are in general much younger than men claimants.The distribution of physical defects over the various age groups may be seen from the percentage table which follows: Proportion of Persons in each A ge Group who had various Physical Defects.Males.

The indications afforded by the above table are, (1) that among the younger claimants apparent physical defects were rather less prevalent among females than among males, (2) that between the ages of 25 and 44 apparent physical defects were considerably less prevalent among the women claimants than among men claimants, (3) that among persons of 60 and over more than one-third of the men and nearly one-half of the women had some kind of apparent physical defect, (4) that amputation and lameness occurred much more frequently among the men than among the women, and occurred principally among men who had been of military service age at the time of the war, (5) that deafness was nearly three times as prevalent among men as among women, and appears to have been related to advancing age rather than to war service, (6) that bad eye-sight was rather more prevalent among women than men, ocur-ring with particular frequency after the age of 54.The relation of physical defects to employability will be seen from the following table : Proportion of Persons in each Category of Employability who had various Physical Defects.Males.Category of imployability.

The four categories A, B, 0, D are in descending order of employability. It will be observed that, as in previous cases involving physical condition,&quot; the proportion of persons with no physical defect is highest in the case of those classified as &quot; who in normal times would be usually in steady or fair employment &apos;&apos; and lowest in the case of persons in categories C and D. In the case of men the persons placed in category C (&quot;persons who would not in normal times obtain a fair amount of employment but who are not considered to be &apos; verging on the unemployable &apos; &quot;) included a large proportion of men who were lame, maimed, and aged, and who suffered from miscel-laneous physical defects.Note on the distribution 0/ Health, Physique and Physical Defects over the several Categories of &quot; employability.&quot;The foregoing sections indicate clearly that interviewing officers, in forming their opinions as to the category of employ-ability into which claimants should be placed, were influenced very largely by apparent or disclosed physical condition. Among the 288 males assigned to category D there were 124 cases of poor physique, 113 cases of poor health and 192 cases of physical defect, while 164 of the persons so classified were aged 60 and over; and among the 32 women there were 13 cases of poor physique, 8 cases of poor health and 14 cases of physical defect, while 11 of the persons were aged 60 and over. Those persons whom interviewing officers placed in the highest category as being persons who, in normal times, would usually be in steady employment are, on the other hand, mostly free from physical shortcomings. In considering the proportion of persons in these four classes of &quot; employability &quot; it should be borne in mind, therefore, that what interviewing officers were judging was physical, and not mental or moral, qualities. It may be that some of those placed hi the category &quot; verging on unemploy-able &quot; had qualities of character or skill which would make them, despite their physical defects, desirable workpeople in special employment; it may be on the other hand, that some of those placed in the highest category had moral or mental failings which would lead to their early discharge from any employment.Age of leaving School, Type of School, and Age of starting Work.Questions were put to all claimants who were under the age of 30 as to the age at which they, left school, the type of school they had attended, and the age at which they started work.

If corresponding information concerning a similar sample of young persons in employment were available, valuable conclusions might be drawn from a comparison of the two sets of figures, but no such information of a comparable kind -exists. In the absence of opportunity for such comparison it must suffice to summarise the salient features of the information :as presented.Of all the persons under 30 interviewed, 94&apos;0 per cent, of the boys and young men and 91&quot;3 per cent, of the girls and young women, left school at or under Ahe age of 14. Of the juveniles under 18 years of age only 14&apos;3 per cent, of the boys and 15 per -cent, of the girls left school before they were 14, these being much lower percentages than in the case of the older youths examined. This recent increase in the age of leaving school is, of course, due -to the provisions of the 1920 Employment of Young Persons Act, and the raising of the school-leaving age by the Education Act of 1921.The two tables dealing with- the type of school attended shows that 5&apos;5 per cent, of the boys and&apos; young men under 30, and 7&apos;4 per cent, of the girls and young women under 30, had attended secondary schools; the rest liad attended only elementary schools. A curious feature of the first of these tables is that while 7&apos;5 per cent, of the boys under 18 and 6&apos;7 per cent, of the youths aged 20 to 24 had attended secondaryAge ,oi&apos; stabtinq Work.

schools, only 3&apos;9 per cent, of the youths aged 18 and 19 and 3&apos;8 per cent, of the young men aged 25 to 29 had done so. In the case of girls and young women the results are of a contrary nature, only 4&apos;8 per cent, of the girls under 18 and 6&apos;9 per cent, of the young women aged 20 to 24 having attended secondary schools as against 9&apos;5 per cent, and 7&apos;8 per cent, in the case of young women of 18 and 19 and 25 to 29 respectively.The two percentage tables relating to the age of starting work may usefully be compared with the corresponding tables for the age of leaving school. For males the numbers and the propor-tions of those who started work at and under 14 years of age are not very different from the numbers and proportions of those who left school at those ages. The obtaining of employment lags a little behind the leaving of school, but the table may be said to indicate that the boys and young men interviewed entered employment of some kind almost immediately they left school. With girls and young women the position is otherwise; 22&apos;7 per cent, left school under the age of 14, but only 14&apos;7 per cent, entered employment at that age, 88&apos;6.per cent, left school at 14, but only 51&apos;9 per cent, entered employment at that age. The inference is that girls who left school at 14 or under did not in general enter employment until some time afterwards.Appkenticeship and Training.All persons interviewed were asked whether they had been apprenticed or trained. The instructions were that if the claimant had served a definite apprenticeship to a trade (e.cj., joiner, fitter), whether he was indentured or not, he should be entered as &quot; apprenticed,&quot; but that if, on the other hand, he was not definitely apprenticed to a trade, but was specifically taught, or had a definite training in, an occupation (e.g., book-keeper or shop-assistant), he should be entered not as &quot; appren-ticed &quot; but as &quot; trained.&quot; The results of this enquiry are set out in percentage form in the following tables : Proportion of Persons in each age group who had been Apprenticed, or Trained, or neither.Age Groups.Males.

Between the ages of 20 and 60 these proportions do not vary greatly, though the younger claimants show a somewhat larger proportion of persons who had been apprenticed. With boys under 18 the proportion apprenticed is substantially lower than in the case of adults of any age, being only 14&apos;3 per cent.; but 25 per cent, claimed to have had some training. Among females only 15 &quot;3 per cent, claimed apprenticeship (as against the 25&apos;9 per cent, for males), but 49&apos;2 per cent, claimed to have had some training (as against only 25&apos;3 per cent, for males). The proportions of females in the various age-groups who are classed as &quot; apprenticed,&quot; &quot; trained &quot; and &quot; neither apprenticed nor trained &quot; vary in a somewhat erratic way, the most favour-able position being held by the young women between 18 and 24.The second of the two tables demonstrates that the claimants, male and female alike, who were placed by interviewing officers in the highest category of employability included a larger pro-portion of persons who had been apprenticed or trained than did those placed in any of the three lower classes. This appears to lend support to the view that lack of apprenticeship or training tends to make a person less employable, but it should not be overlooked that there is a tendency for the best type of boys and girls to be accepted for apprenticeship or training. As regards category D it should be remembered that this category includes a large proportion of old and infirm people who, though appren-tieed or trained in their youth, are now liable to unemployment on grounds unconnected with skill or training. It should further be remembered, in considering the high proportion of &quot; trained &quot; females as compared with &quot; trained &quot; males, that training in
33.the case of a woman often means something more meagre or casual than in the case of a man, and that the general labourer class is found almost wholly among men.Number of Dependants.Questions were asked of claimants interviewed as to the number of persons dependent upon them. Distinction wag made in the reports between adults and children and between those dependants covered by Dependants&apos; Benefit under the Unem-ployment Insurance Acts and those not so covered. The analysis of the figures for all dependants (whether covered by Dependants&apos; Benefit or not) is shown in the following tables : -Numbers and Percentages of Persons with and without Depen-dants and the Numbers and Percentages of Dependants.Males.656Age Gkotjps.

It will be seen that, according to the statements of claimants as to the whole number of persons dependent on them, whether covered by Dependants&apos;, Benefit or :not ,.-42&quot;9 per cent, of the male claimants were stated to have no one dependent on them, and 57&apos;1 per cent, to have dependants, either adults or,children or both. The average number of persons stated to be dependent upon those male claimants who had dependants was 2&apos;7 per claimant. Of the female claimants interviewed 89&apos;9 per cent, were stated to have no one dependent on them, and 101 per cent, had dependants, adults or children or both. The average num-ber of persons stated to be dependent upon those female claimants who had dependants was 1&apos;7 per claimant.The information recorded under this head has also been analysed separately in respect of persons having dependants for whom Dependants&apos; Benefit was authorised..

657Of the;total number of males covered by the investigation 52.7 per cent, had no dependants in respect of whom they were drawing Dependants&apos; Benefit and 47&apos;3 per cent, had such dependants. Of the 3,898 males drawing Dependants&apos; Benefit 35&apos;2 per cent, were receiving benefit in respect of wife or house-keeper only, 6 per cent, in respect of child or children only, and 58&apos;8 in respect of an adult with one or more children. Tlie male claimants interviewed were receiving benefit in respect of 3,666 adults and 5,810 children. Thus of every 100 male claimants interviewed, 47 had dependants, comprising 45 dependent adults and 70 dependent children. Of the females interviewed only 1;5 per cent, were drawing benefit in respect of dependants. Of every 100 females, only 1-5 had dependants, comprising 0-3 adults and&apos;2 children.a further analysis has been made of the size of the families of those who were drawing Dependants&apos; Benefit. Only children in respect of whom Dependants&apos; Benefit was being received are here taken into account. The results are given in the following tableNumbers of Children Dependent upon Clavmants loho were drawing Dependants&apos; Benefit in respect of Children._	Number on which Benefit was authorised in re-spect of Dependent Children.

As regards the women 41&apos;0 per cent, were drawing benefit in respect of 1 child and 500 per cent, in respect of 2 children.Occasion has been taken to test further the trustworthiness of the sample taken for the purposes of this enquiry by comparing the analysis in respect of Dependants&apos; Benefit with a similar analysis of 373,000 claims made in January, 1923. The two analyses are set out side by side in Tables XXVII and XXVIII on pages 82 and 83. It must again be remarked that changes may have occurred in the composition of the unemployed over the nine months separating the two dates, the tendency of which  would be on balance towards impairing the correspondence of the two sets of figures.   When an allowance is made for this factor
the correspondence will be seen to be surprisingly good, and it affords further testimony to the representative character of the one per cent, sample taken on this occasion.When first Insured against Unemployment.The schedule relating to each claimant was referred to the appropriate Ledger Account at the Claims and Eecord Office, ITew, and from the entries in the ledger it was possible to record accurately the year in which the claimant entered insurance. The first provisional analysis of this information was confined to distinguishing between persons who entered insurance before November 8th, 1920 (the date on which the 1920 Unemployment Insurance Act came into force) and those who entered after that date. This distinction is shown in percentage form, by age and by category of employability, in the following tables : Proportion of Claimants in each age. group who entered Insurance before and after 8th November, 1920.

The tables show that 52&apos;3 per cent, of the males and 16&apos;4 per cent, of the females entered insurance before the 1920 Act came into force. The figure of 52&apos;3 per cent, is high, considering that not more than 4,000,000 persons (about 3,400,000 men and 600,000 women) were covered before the 1920 Act as against 11,250,000 covered at the present time; but it is to be remembered that persons who were insured prior to 1920 are likely to have accumulated contributions during the war and pre-war periods and to be less subject to disqualification on the score of insufficient contributions than persons who have entered insurance since that date, from which it would follow that they would be more fully represented among the claimants. A possible further factor is that males who were insured under the 1916 Act as being temporarily employed in the munition industries are now suffering more from unemployment than are males in industry generally. Another factor certainly is that the metal, engineering and shipbuilding industries, which were all insurable prior to the 1920 Act, are at present passing through a very bad period, and workers in these industries are correspond-ingly heavily represented in the claimants to unemployment benefit. The effect of this must be somewhat offset by the cases of building trade workers who are in general at present well employed, but the second influence is not so heavy as the first.Contribution and Benefit.Particulars of contributions paid and benefit drawn were obtained partly from the current unemployment books and. current claims and partly from the Ledger Accounts at the Claims and Records Office, Eew. The first analysis of this information was confined to ascertaining the average number of weekly contributions paid by claimants of various ages since their entry into insurance and the average number of days benefit drawn since that tiine. The results of this analysis are as follows : Average! number of Weekly Contributions paid, and the average Number of days&apos; benefit drawn by Claimants of various ages since their entry into insurance.

The table shows that on the average claimants of all ages (with the single exception of young women aged 18 and 19) had drawn-more days&apos; benefit than, they had paid weeks&apos; contribu-tions. The relation of benefit drawn to contributions paid does not vary greatly as between one age group and another, but it may be noted that among males the least benefit relative to con-tributions had been drawn by boys under 18 and the most by men of 20 to 29 years of age. Among females the least benefit relative to contributions paid had been drawn by girls and young women under 21, and the most by women over 60.It is of interest to notice that the claimants assigned to &quot;the lowest category of employability had drawn much more benefit relative to the contributions they had paid than had those in the highest category. For males the figures are: Category A, 191 Contributions and. 292 days&apos; benefit; Category B, 156 contribu-tions and 353 days&apos; benefit; Category C, 124 contributions and 325 days&apos; benefit and Category D, 154 contributions and 431 days&apos;&apos;benefit. Expressed in comparable terms this means that for every contribution paid, the males assigned to Category A had drawn 153 days&apos; benefit; those assigned to Category B had drawn;2&apos;26 days&apos; benefit; those placed in.Category C had drawn 2&apos;62 days&apos; benefit;.and those in Category D had drawn 2*80 days&apos; benefit/ For females the corresponding figures are :-Category A, 122 days&apos; benefit; Category B, 1&apos;54 days&apos;; Category C, 1*59 days&apos; and Category D, 2*56 days&apos;. It will be seen that there is in the case of both sexes a progressive increase in the benefit drawn relative to contributions paid as the degree of employabilityfalis.:   .&apos;       v:/;-/    maIn considering the amount of benefit drawn in relation to con-&apos; tributions paid it is desirable to distinguish between persons who entered;-insurance in the earlier and in more recent years. Tables XV to XX (pages 64 to 75) show by age groups, by sex, by categories of employability and by totals, the number of claimants interviewed who entered insurance year by year from 1912-13 onward, also the number of contributions paid by those claimants and the number of days&apos; benefit drawn by them during the whole time since thfeir entry into insurance. In XXI and XXII, on pages 76 and [77 these detailed tables are summarised and the figures reduced jso as to show the average contributions and days&apos; benefit per claimant in each year of entry. These two latter figures are then; &quot;reduced to a. ratio representing the &quot; number of days&apos; benefit drawn for every weekly contribution paid,&quot; the figures being given separately for each category of employability and for all categories together.From these tables there may be calculated, in the first place, the proportions, among the claimants interviewed, of persons who entered insurance under (a) the 1911 Act, which covered building, public works contracting, shipbuilding, engineering, construction of vehicles, ironfounding, and certain branches of sawmilling, (b) the 1916 Act, which extended the provisions to
include workpeople employed upon -munition work or employed in certain specified industries. including the metal, chemical, rubber, leather and brick-making industries, and (c) the 1920 Act, which, with certain&apos; exceptions, extended unemployment ^hsur-ance to workers in all industries except agriculture and domestic service. The results of this computation are as follows :  &quot;Of the males interviewed, 25&apos;3 per cent, entered under the 1911 Act, 27&apos;0 per cent, under the,1916 Act, and 47&apos;7 per cent, under the 1920 Act. Of the females, T7 per cent, entered under the 1911 Act, 14&apos;7 per cent, under-the 1916&apos;Acty and 83&apos;6 per cent, under the 1920 Act.. In considering the insurance history and position of persons who entered insurance in the first and succeeding insurance years it will be well to examine more particularly the table relating to males in that the numbers represented by the sample taken of females is hardly large enough to&quot; make a detailed analysis trustworthy.As regards males, then, it will be remarked that 17&apos;8 per cent, of all.the claimants entered insurance in the insurance&apos;year 1912-13, and these have drawn, in the subsequent 10 or more years, only 0&apos;95 days&apos; benefit per contribution, as against 1&apos;75 days for malesgenerally.In the next three years, 19.13-14 to 1915-16, insurance being-still confined to the industries covered by the 1911 Act, 7&apos;6 per cent, of the male claimants interviewed entered insurance. It will be noticed that these claimants in the period that has elapsed since they became insured, have drawn respectively T35, T52 and T90 days&apos; benefit per contribution, as compared with the 0&apos;95 days of the 1912-13 entrants. This marked and increasing deterioration in the subsequent insurance record of the entrants in these three years would appear to be due almost wholly to the fact that the males who entered insurance when the original Act came into force, were in general naturally much older* than those who entered year by year as the Act continued its operation unextended, and since the incidence of military service was more heavy on these younger men, their absence from insured industry in subsequent years is reflected in the fall in the average number of contributions from 407 per head for 1912-13 entrants, to 281, 246 and 219 per head for those who entered in the three succeeding years. It is, indeed, the&apos; fewer contributions due to military service and not the more days&apos; benefit drawn which causes the benefit per contribution to rise in the case of claimants who entered in these three later years of the 1911 Act.The extension of insurance under the 1916 Act again brought in at the outset large numbers of adults. Only about 25&apos;0 per cent, of the male claimants covered by this enquiry who entered insurance in 1916-17 were then under 23 years of age while about 55 per cent, were over&apos;38 years of age. This, again reflects a result * Thus, of the mules who were brought under the original Act in 1912-13, only 2G&quot;4 per cent were then under 23 years of age, bat some 50 per. cent, of those who entered in 1913-14 were under that age.459S4
of liability to military service, and the 1916-17 entrants, in-stead of showing that further fall in subsequent contributions per head up to date which the later entry would otherwise automati-cally require shows an increase from 219 per head in the previous year to 235, while the subsequent days&apos; benefit per contribution falls from T90 in the previous year to 1&apos;69.In the next three years, during which the 1916 Act continued without further statutory extensions, the new entrant males show a subsequent industrial history of 165, 137 and 115 average con-tributions per head. As the period during which these persons have been in insurance since that time has been approximately six, five and four years respectively, the fall in contributions is almost exactly proportionate to the reduction in the time during which the claimants could have been in employment. The benefit drawn has not, however, fallen at the same rate, and the result is that the males who entered insurance in these three years show on the average a subsequent history of 2-13, 2&apos;39 and 2&apos;99 days&apos; benefit per contribution according as they entered insurance in 1917-18, 1918-19 and 1919-20.In 1920-21, 39\1 per cent, of all the male claimants interviewed came for the first time under insurance. These have paid about the same proportion of contributions relative to the time that has elapsed since they became insured as in the case of those who entered in earlier years, but the benefit they have drawn has been rather more, relative to the time that has since elapsed, than in the case of earlier entrants, and their ratio up to November last works out at 3&apos;02 days&apos; benefit per contribution paid. It will be observed that, of the claimants interviewed, those who entered insurance in 1920-21 were in general much younger at the date of entry than those who entered in the first years of the 1911 and 1916 Acts; about 25&apos;0 per cent, of them were under 21 at that time.The tables also disclose that, so far. as the claimants interviewed are concerned, the subsequent industrial his-tory of the younger men has been better than! that of the older. For example, of all the contributions since paid by persons entering in that year, 18&apos;7 per cent, have been paid by men now aged 20 to 24, but only 15&apos;9 per cent, of the benefit drawn has been drawn by men within those ages. On the other-hand, 34&apos;3 per cent, of the subsequent contributions from these entrants have been paid by men of 45 onwards, while 4T8 per cent, of the benefit has been drawn by men of that age. The same feature may be expressed in another way by saying that the men of 20 to 24 who entered in 1920-21 have since drawn 2-6 days&apos; benefit per contribution paid while the men of 45 onwards have drawn 3&apos;7 days.Some 40 per cent, of those claimants interviewed who entered insurance in 1921-22 and 1922-23 were at the time of entry under 18 years of age and the ratio for these claimants was approxi-mately only T2 days&apos; benefit per contribution paid.
.    .   41!&apos;.:&apos;- The figures for the three insurance years subsequent to 1920-21 show that the ratio of- benefit to contributions paid and drawn by entrants in those years was 2&apos;38 in 1921-22, T31 in 1922-23 and 0&apos;29 in&apos; 1923-24. This is due partly to the fact that boys are represented very heavily in the numbers of the claimants inter-viewed who entered insurance in those years; but still more is it due to the operation of Section 41 of the 1920 Act.Section 41 of the 1920 Act introduces a complication in these ratio tables which becomes important in years subsequent to 1920-21. This section prescribed that men discharged from His Majesty&apos;s Forces should, after July 31st, 1920, be granted a. free credit of 90 insurance contributions against which they might draw unemployment benefit. This credit was increased to 156 contributions in respect of men discharged from the Forces on or after July 3rd, 1922. Men discharged from the Forces appear, therefore, in the figures for entrants since July 31st, 1920, as having paid 90 or 156 contributions, according as they left the Forces before or after July 3rd, T.922. The importance of the influence of this factor upon the post-1920 ratios may be gauged from the fact that 11 per cent, of all the contributions paid by those claimants examined who were under the age of 24 were contributions credited to ex-service men under Section 41.The operation of Section 41 of the 1920 Act accounts for what would otherwise seen impossible that males who entered in-surance during the four months prior to the making of this, investigation had on the average 113 weekly contributions to their credit. These entrants include a considerable number of men discharged from H.M. Forces who had 156 contributions placed initially to their credit.It will be convenient to show the number of days&apos; benefit drawn per contribution paid by male claimants of various ages who entered insurance in the different insurance years. This information is given in the following table : Table showing for Claimants in each age group who entered insurance in the various Insurance Years the Number of Days&apos; Benefit drawn per Contribution paid.Males : Total all Ages.*66iesent Ages.

An explanation of this was given on page 17.
The table -.setting out the ratio of benefit to contributions for females does, not lend itself to close analysis as.regards the respective years of entry into insurance by reason.of the small numbers afforded by the sample for the earlier and later years of entry.. It will be remarked, however, that the female claimants interviewed taken as a whole had drawn 1&apos;27 days&apos; benefit for each contribution paid, as compared with T75 days in the case of males. The largest ratio of benefit, to contributions occurs, with the exception of the. single claimant who entered in the year 1912-13, in the case of those females interviewed who entered insurance in.the years 1918-19,1919-20 and 1920-21, who will be seen to have drawn 1&apos;65, 1&apos;35 and 1&apos;36 days&apos; benefit respectively for each contribution paid. As in the case of the males, those females who were classed by interviewing officers as belonging to Category D (persons verging on the unemployable) appear throughout as having drawn more benefit relative to contributions paid than those assigned to Category A, but in no year-of-entrance group does the ratio for females in Category D exceed 2&apos;74 days&apos; benefit per contribution as compared with the maximum of 13&apos; 75 days in the 1921-22 group for males. There is, however, a female claimant of between 20 and 24 years of age in Category E who had drawn 9&apos;8 days&apos; benefit per contribution paid.:Uncovenanted Benefit.returns   relating to this 10,000 sample of claimants have been further analysed with a view to their furnishing an indication of the proportions of claimants who are drawing what may be &apos; termed &quot; covenanted &quot; or &quot;uncovenanted &quot; benefit respectively.The term &quot; covenanted benefit &quot; is used to denote that benefit which an insured person: can claim as a. right if he satisfies the statutory conditions laid down in the Acts. Prior to November 8th, 1920, an insured person might claim,, provided he was not disqualified on other grounds, one week&apos;s benefit for every five contributions paid. In the 1920 Act this proportion was changed to one \veek&apos;s benefit for every six contributions paid, and this latter rule remained in force until the Fourth Special Period which began on November 2nd, 1922, and ended on October 17th, 1923. During this Fourth Special Period the insured person might claim one wee;k&apos;s benefit for:every three contributions paid and no account was taken in arriving at benefit payable during the period of any benefit that had been drawn between-Sfch November, 1920, and 2nd November, 1922. Similarly during the First Benefit year beginning 18th October, 1923, no account is taken of benefit drawn between 8th November, 1920, and October, 1923. Benefit drawn under these regulations is termed, for convenience, &quot; covenanted benefit.&quot;Legislation subsequent to the Act of 1920 added a temporary system of &quot; uncovenanted benefit,&quot; that is benefit allowed as a discretionary grant to persons who had exceeded all rights derived from payment of contributions.   Moreover, unemployed persons
43have needed to be and have been allowed to be continuously, on benefit for much longer periods&apos; than was contemplated by the Act of 1920. . ;It will be evident that persons drawing what is termed &quot; covenanted benefit &quot; are comprised of two classes : (a) persons who have not exceeded the benefit they were entitled to draw under the one-in-six rule, and (6) persons who have drawn more benefit than would have been allowed under the one-in-six rule but are still within the extended application of the term &apos;&apos; cove&apos; nanted benefit &quot; due to relaxations during the Fourth Special Period.1By reason of the complexities mentioned above, it has not hitherto been possible to do more than conjecture what proportion of the persons drawing unemployment benefit were drawing benefit reckoned on the one-in-six basis. The present enquiry has, however, afforded, an opportunity of doing so in respect of the limited sample in question. The first analysis undertaken has been directed to ascertaining what proportion of claimants interviewed were receiving benefit in excess of what they could have received under the rule prescribing not more than one week&apos;s benefit for every six contributions. This may be expressed as one day&apos;s benefit drawn for each weekly contribution paid, and the analysis has proceeded along the Hnes of ascer-taining for each age group and each category of employability what proportion of the claimants had contributions to their credit in excess of days&apos; benefit drawn and what proportion had drawn days of benefit in excess of contributions paid. &apos;This analysis is set out in tables XXIII and XXIV, for males and females respectively, on pages 78 and 79. These tables show that of all the male claimants interviewed, 70-8 per cent, had drawn more benefit than they would have been entitled to under the. one-in-six rule, and only 29&apos;2 per cent, had drawn benefit within the provisions of that rule had it been in force throughout. In the case of females, 51-2 per cent, had drawn more benefit than the one-in-six rule would have allowed, and 48&apos;8 per cent, had drawn benefit within what that rule would have prescribed as the maximum.If the two tables be considered with reference to the ages of the claimants interviewed, it will be seen that in the case of males the largest proportion of claimants who exceeded the amount of benefit which the one-in-six rule would have allowed occurs among men of. 60 and over (75&apos;3 per. cent.) and among those aged 25 to 29 (74&apos;8 per cent.), while the lowest proportion occur among juveniles under 18 (49&apos;6 per cent.), and among young men of 18 and 19 (64&apos;8 per cent.). Among females the lowest proportion is found among young women of 18 and 19 years of age (39&apos;5 per cent.), and the largest among.women over 60 (&apos;71&apos;8 per cent.). -661
An examination of the differences in this regard between claimants placed in the several categories of employability con-forms with what has already been brought out in other tables Of the males assigned to Category A (persons who in normal times would usually be in steady employment) only 65&apos;9 per cent, had drawn benefit in excess of what the one-in-six rule would have allowed, while 87&apos;8 per cent, . of: those in Category D (persons verging on the unemployable) had drawn benefit in excess of the maximum which that rule would have allowed. In the case of females the corresponding proportions are 49&apos;0 per cent, for Category A, and 81&apos;3 per cent, for Category D.Poor Law Belief.Information was obtained in every case from the Poor Law Authorities as to whether the claimant was in receipt of Poor Law relief, and, if so, at what weekly rate. In the following table a percentage analysis is made of the number of persons who were, and who were not, according to the information sup-plied by the Poor Law Authorities, in receipt of poor relief over and above their Unemployment Benefit.Proportion of Claimants in each age group who were, and who were not, in personal receipt of Poor Relief.

The age groups showing the heaviest proportion of males in receipt of Poor Relief are 30 to 34 (20&apos;7 per cent.), 35 to 44 (17-0 per cent.), and 25 to 29 (13-3 per cent.). In the case of females the age group showing the heaviest proportion is that of women from 45 to 54 years of age (4&apos;0 per cent.).

Particulars were also obtained as to claimants who., though not themselves personally in receipt of Poor Belief, formed part&apos; of a family some member of which was in receipt of such relief. The information furnished under this head shows that, in addition to the 844 male and 14 female claimants who were in personal receipt of benefit, 60 males and 21 females formed part of families some other member of which was drawing Poor Belief.The numbers of claimants of various ages who were personal recipients of Poor Belief, distinguished according to the category of employability into which they were placed by interviewing officers, are shown in the following tables :-Numbers and ages of Claimants interviewed who were in Personai Receipt of Poor Relief.Males.
The table indicates that a smaller proportion of the male;; &apos; placed in the lowest category of &quot; employability &quot; are in receipt of Poor Eelief than is the case with any of the better categories. This is due to the fact that category D is largely composed of elderly persons who had few children of dependent age. Of the 23 men in this category who were in receipt of Poor Relief eight had neither adult nor child dependant, and nine had an adult but no child dependant. In the case of females, the numbers in receipt of Poor Eelief.are so small (14 cases in all) as to make any inferences from the various sub-divisions of age and category unreliable.A further analysis of the information obtained with regard to Poor Relief has been made with the object of showing how much Poor Relief was being paid to persons in receipt of various amounts of Unemployment and Dependants&apos; Benefit.

It will be seen from the table that the cases which most frequently occur among males in receipt of Poor Belief over and above their unemployment benefit are of men drawing from 20s. to 24s. a week in benefit (which means men with a dependent wife, or with wife and from one to four dependent children) and in receipt also of Poor Belief ranging from 2s. 6d. to 12s. (id. per week. The largest combined amounts paid from the two sources were.to men with wife and from three to seven children who were in receipt of sums ranging from about - 56s. to about 65s. per week. The receipt of 7s. 6d. Unemployment Benefit denotes a juvenile under 18, and it will be observed that three of the juvenile claimants were in receipt of some additional sum under 5s. from the Poor Law authorities.It wili be noticed that of the 844 males in receipt of Poor Belief supplementary to their Unemployment Benefit 95 were receiving benefit at the rate of 15s. per week, which indicates an adult male receiving no benefit in respect of dependants. The number here seems large. An examination of the cases shows that 42 were single, 7 of them being boys without parental support, the rest adults; 44 were&apos; married men who are in general described as &quot; living apart from wife &quot; or &quot; wife working,&quot; and eleven were widowers, most of whom were over 60 years of age.
In the case of females the receipt of 6*. Unemployment Benefit denotes a girl under 18,12s. denotes a woman with no dependants, and 13s., 14s., and 15s. denote women with respectively one, two, and three dependent children. Eleven of the 14 women were drawing Unemployment Benefit in respect of themselves only and, in addition, weekly sums ranging from 5s. to 15s. from the Poor Law authorities. There was one girl under 18 who was in receipt of an additional small sum in Poor Eelief.Contributions in last 122 weeks.Further, an attempt has been made to ascertain from the returns how much unemployment claimants had had during the 122 weeks preceding the date (November 5th to 10th, 1923) on which the enquiry was made. For this purpose it was necessary to confine the analysis to those persons who were in insurance prior to the beginning of the 1921-22 insurance year, that is to say, persons who were in insurance before July 4th, 1921. The enquiry has proceeded along the lines of ascertaining how many contributions these claimants had paid since that date. It should be understood that the payment of a contribution in respect of a particular weekdoes not necessarily mean that the claimant was in employment during the whole of that week : a, stamp will in some cases represent only one day&apos;s or balf-day&apos;s employment in the week. The analysis cannot therefore be read as meaning that the claimants had dining these 122 weeks as many full week V employment as they had numbers of contri-butions in their books, but it is probable that taking the claimants as a whole such a reading would not give a very material over-statement.In Table XXIX is given the actual numbers of male claimants who had entered insurance before July 4th, 1921, and had paid since that date various numbers of contributions. The table shows these claimants analysed by age and by category of em-ployability. In tables XXX, XXXI and XXXII the more im-portant of these data are reproduced in percentage form.It will be observed that 5&apos;0 per cent, of the claimants who had entered insurance prior to July 4th, 1921, had had no insured employment whatever since that date. Considered by categories it will be seen that whilst only 3&apos;6 per cent, of those placed in Category A had had no insured employment during the period, 6&apos;0 percent, of those in Cateogry B, 13&apos;2 of those in Category C and 17&apos;0 of those in Category D were in that position.If the period of 122 weeks be divided roughly into four portions the analysis indicates that 28&apos;6 per cent, of these males had done some insured work in from 0 to 29 weeks, 263 per cent, had done
some insured work in from 30 to 59 weeks, 26&apos;8 per cent, had done some insured work in from 60 to 89 of the weeks, and 19&apos;3 per cent, had done some insured work in from 90 to 122 weeks.Considered by age groups the analysis shows that the propor-tion of youths under 20 who had had little employment in the period is relatively small while the proportion of men of 60 and over who had had no insured employment during the period is nearly twice as great as in the case of persons in the other age groups.Comparison of Ex-Service and Non-Ex-Service Men.An analysis has been made of all the claims of men who entered insurance prior to July, 1921, with a view to distinguish-ing ex-Service from non-ex-Service men as regards age distribu-. tion and numbers of contributions paid since 4th July, 1921.Of the whole number of such men, 38-4 per cent, were ex-Service men, and 61&apos;6 per cent. non-ex-Service men. The age analysis shows that 550 per cent, of the ex-Service men were under thirty-five years of age; and nearly all were under forty-five years of age.The comparison of the industrial fortunes of the two classes during the 2J years prior to the Enquiry may best be shown by stating the proportions of ex-Service and non-ex-Service men respectively who had worked during 0 to 29 weeks, 30 to 59 weeks, 60 to 89 weeks, and 90 to 122 weeks, during the previous 122 weeks, confining the comparison to men between 20 and 44 years of age. The results are as follows : Ages 20-44.	20 to 44 weeks.	25 to 59 weeks.	60 to 89 weeks.	90 to 122 weeks.	Total.Ex-Service   ...... Non-ex-Service	o/o 29-4 24-4	o/o 26-1 26-2	% 24-6 28-2	O/o 19-9 21-2	.  9b &apos;. 100-0 100-0It will be seen that the non-ex-Service men had had a some-what better employment history in the 122 weeks than the ex-Service men, but the difference is not substantial, and the sig-significant feature of the analysis, however considered, is the similarity in the amount of work which the two classes had had over the period.
