v O i&apos;j(the- Document is. the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)SECRET - COPY Hq.CP .-19Q .(84) .Q r A. S . I .T FT, S INGAPQRE. THE REPLY FROM INPIA.(Note by the Secretary.)In view of the statement in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram&apos;of March 7, 1924 (Paper 0.P.-186 (24)) that the Indian Govern-m-joint have never been consulted or informed regarding the detailed reasons or exact plan of the policy of the late Government to crsate a new naval bas9 at Singapore, I feel it my duty to draw attention to the following facts.India has been represented at all the following, bodies which have considered the proposed naval bass at Singapore;-AT THE CABINET, where the policy was discussed, by the Secret ary of State.AT THE COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE, where the strategy was discussed, by the Secretary of State and sometimes by the Military Secretary, India Office.AT THE OVERSEAS DEFENCE COMMITTEE, where the details were discussed, by the Military Secretary, India Office.AT THE IMPERIAL CONFERENCES, 1921 and 1923,where the Imperial aspects were discussed, by the Secretary of State and specially selected representatives who were present not only at the main discussions but also at the special confidential -&apos; tial discussions&apos; at the Admiralty in 1923, when Lord Beatty explained the whole scheme in the utmost detail,
The whole of the documents prepared for the imperial conferences, 1921 and 1923, were, of course, forwarded tothe Government of India,   The various Memoranda (all ofwhich were approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence,where, as already mentioned, India was represented) containfull details of the reasons why Singapore is cf 3pecialinterest to India.   It is sufficient to mention that the documents for the 1923 Conference include a special Memoran-dun! on India&apos;s Place in Empire Naval Policy and Co-operation(Paper B.-65), which contains the following :-&quot;The enemy&apos;s obvious and most natural objective during the interval would be Singapore,, tho seizure of which would lay Indian ports and Indian trade open to heavy attack by enemy raiders.   The resultant loss, both direct and indirect, would amount to a disaster of the first magnitude not only to India herself but to the whole Empire, and It is on this, account that India as invited to oo-ocerate in the creation of &quot;the SingaporeWhen the Defence Resolutions of the Imperial Conference, 1923, were being drafted, I was specially enjoined by Lord Salisbury, who had the matter in hand, to ascertain from the Secretary of State whether he wished to include India with Australia and New Zealand among the parts of the Empire expressing &quot;deep interest ....... in the provision of a naval base at Singapore as essential for ensuring the mobility necessary to provide for the security of the territories and trade of the Empire in Eastern waters&quot;.   Lord Peel asked that India might be so included, and a Resolution was passed by the Conference, in the presence of the Indian Delegatee, The Resolutions have since been published and have, no doubt, been forwarded to the Government of India.Prom, the above summary it, will be seen that not only has the attention of India been drawn to the question of Singfcpp.ro to the same, extent as any of the Dominions, but that there is no important phase, either of principle or detail In the working out of the Singapore policy, in which India has net
584e-- \j &amp;been associated.   Unlike the Dominions, India has been represented at the Cabinet, the Committee of Imperial Defence, and the Oversea Defence Committee,It is submitted, in these cireamst&amp;ncee, that the Viceroy&apos;s statement that the Government of India have never been consulted or informed regarding the detailed reasona or the exact plan of the policy of the late Government to create a new naval baso at Singapore, requires some qualification.(Sd,) M.P.A. Hankey,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, March 15\ 1924.
