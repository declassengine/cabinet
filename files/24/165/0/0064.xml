C A B I N B T.&apos;OOMLaJHIOAglpg OF DiTOiOEIOH 10 IHE PKSSS. ^052J?y       first Lord ofi the Adiairalty.At the last meetins of the Cabinet I promised my colleagues further information in regard to the reports of a statement made to representatives of the Pre3S at the Admiralty concerning the figures of British Empire Trade and shipping,Y/hen I first came to the Admiralty I made enquiries as to the arrangements in force for giving information to the Press, and was told that the publicity Department of the Admiralty was done away with in 1921.     The then Board of Admiralty appreciating the desirability of having someone at the Admiralty whom the Press and public could approach on general matters concerning the naval service, appointed an Officer of the Home Intelligence Section of the iTaval Intelligence Division to carry out these duties in addition to his own. .   The duties of this Officer are to answer questions put to him, to issue to the press Admiralty Communiques signed by the secretary, and to arrange that in a room set aside for visitors on-behalf of the press and otherwise, movements of Ships, Appointments and other items of general flaval interest should be available.     It has bean the practice, both before and since the War, to give the Press information that is non-confidential.    Bothing is given to the press unless it is first asked for, except Official Gomffiiuniqaas.     vlhen there is a general desire of the Press for certain information or it is felt on the application of one or two papers for information that all the Press should have it, the newspapers are invited to send representatives.
re pre scntative s to the Admiralty, where they are addressed by either the First lord, the pirst Sea lord, or by whoeyor is directed,,When on March lot the First Sea lord mentioned to me that it was proposed to give representatives of the Press some information on the subject of Trade; Routes, I saw in this no departure from precedent,     I think my colleagues were under the impression that the statement made had particular reference to trade in Eastern y/atars, and especially to the considerations which led the Admiralty to advise the development of the laval Base at Singapore, This, I think, was due to &apos; some misapprehension.    There Was never any question of giving a lecture on Singapore, but by what I believe to have been nothing more than a coicidence, an article appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; on March 4th, the clay after the statement in question, advocating the Singapore proposals and quoting some particulars in regard to British trade in Eastern Waters,     I do not think: that there was anything in that article which may not very well have been in the possession of the writer before the statement was made at the Admiralty.    As to the circumstance in which the article was written, I have of course no information, but I see, no reason for supposing that it would not have appeared on Tuesday morning; had there been, no statement at all made, on Monday.I will now state briefly what took place at the Admiralty on March 3rd.    Two newspapers, knowing of the existence of the Admiraltyls Trade Route, and &quot;Commodity&quot;      * Charts^ had requested permission to publish them with, explanations.     These charts are not secret, so they could not well have been refused, but it was thought inadvisable and unfair to the other papers not to let them all have
U 3 -the information.     Charts are of little use without properexplanations, so a note was sent to the J clitors of all!papers inviting- representatives to attend at the admiralty to have an opportunity of seeing&apos; the specially preparedoharts showing the volume of Umpire Trade that is eontinuallyon the High Seas and to heal&apos; the explanatory statement ofthe responsibilities of the Navy ioi&quot; the ^roteotion of thatti ?,de as placed before the Imperial Conference.     The pressrepresentatives came accordingly, and the explanatorystatement was made by Captain Norris, the Director of theTrade &quot;Division, whose functions had involved in the ordinary iioourse the preparation of the charts both for the ImperialConference and foi&apos; use in the Admiralty.     The charts came to ths notice of the Press through a lecture given a fewmonths ago at Admiralty reqaesb to the London Universityon the submarine Menace and its effect on food supplies,.for the purposes of which the lecturer used, the charts inquestion.     By arrangement between the representativesof the press, it was agreed not to publish any account ofthe information given in the charts until Wednesday, Harch5th, and on that day accordingly &quot;The Times&quot; published areproduction of the principal chart showing Empire shipping on the trade routes of the world, with a summary of theinformation given to the press on the subject, a referenceto whioh will show that the statement was of a very general character and only touched very indirectly on the questionof Singapore by showing separately from the general *statistics the figures of trade for the Indian and PacificOceans.     other newspapers published articles which theyhang upon a brief account of the statement of Captain Norris.&quot;The Morning Post&quot;, however, pointed out that hisexposition....
exposition was &quot;necessarily restricted to plain facts&quot;. The various newspapers drew their own conclusions,,The result has been somewhat unfortunate, but as the information had been asked for, it was not really possible to refuse it, nor could it have been fairly confined to those papers alone who. had actually made requests, a course which I think might well have led to protest from various quarters, and would have laid the Admiralty open to a more serious imputation than any that can possibly be brought against us by the course that was actually followed,     I do recognise, however, that it is regrettable that at tho present moment of high tension in regard to the questior? of Singapore the various newspapers should have been allowed to get possession of a new instrument for accentuating the controversy, and had I realised how the newspapers would have used the information for this purpose, I should, of course, have withheld approval for the communication of these charts, at any rate, until after&apos;the Governments announcement on the subject of Singapore,I cannot help thinking that the unfortunate coinci-dance of &quot;The Times&quot; article on Singapore appearing on the morning after the leotu.ro may have served to exacerbate the feelings of the newspapers whose policy is opposed to -the Singapore Base owing to thsir supposing that an unfair march had beon stolen upon them(Intld.)   0,7th March 1924.
