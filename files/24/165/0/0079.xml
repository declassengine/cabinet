Our reasons for this view are -(l)   That in the main the matters for consideration involve important questions which cannot be decided without close reference to the general policy of the Government, and(2)   That it is doubtful whether any useful purpose would be served by (while certainly delay must result from) the remission of the subject to an independent Expert or a Committee.of Experts.In this connection it should be borne in mind that the Government hatfe at hand the accumulated special knowledge,and experience of the Forestry Commission and other&apos;Departments concerned with afforestation and kindred problems
