HBKGI mm IMG AMD SHIPBUILDINB .Trade with China was good, but a question of urgent importance had arisen there in regard to the Trade Marks Law.     (For the discussion on this subject, see page 12 at end of the Minutes on the Trade Outlook.)Resuming, Sir Arthur BaIfour said that he looked for a steady improvement and diminution, of unemployment in 1924, but only of a very gradual kind.Sir Glynn West said that in one branch of the iron and steel trade, business with India was good, namely, in Hoops.The demand for wire, wire-netting and wire rope was also good.     The heavy steel trade, however, was in a bad state.    Big offers of steel were being received in this country from time to time at rates 2  per ton cheaper than we can produce, from Belgium and France - though he could not say whether these countries were the real country of origin.    This foreign attack was mostly being felt in regard to billets, which were offered in some instances at  5.12.0d. per ton, for the manufacture of hoops, wire, etc.; the position, he thought, needed the Government s careful consideration.Business in machine tools was not bright at present, but there was a somewhat bigger demand, partly from over-seas, partly for the home market.There was a steady improvement in shipbuilding, though yards were not, of course, being employed up to anything like their capacity.    But he thought that orders were coming on;   ships had. to be renewed periodically, and a careful ship-owner would write off his vessels in from 15 to 20 years.     %.e present delay in the replacement programme would probably mean an acceleration of renewals later on;   but at present shipowners were doing badly, and had no money to put aside for the purpose.     Obsolete ships were now mostly broken up, he thought, and not sold abroad.     Probably a large proportion of the ships now laid up would have to be scrapped, as they probably could, not be made to pay their way again, and were often indeed a source of loss to their owners, outweighing the profits made from their more modern vessels.With regard to Russia, he observed that that country could only recover its prosperity if its transport system were rehabilitated, and this would involve orders for transport material and. ships.     From that point of view it should be of help to all countries if the Russians were in a position to place orders, but it was no doubt a question of credits.    Questioned, as to a possible demand from Russia for heavy agricultural machinery, he said he understood that this trade in this class of machinery was not at present in a very flourishing condition.

From that point of view it should be of help to all countries if the Russians were  * in a position to place orders, but it was no doubt a question of credits.     Questioned as to a possible demand from Russia for heavy agricultural machinery, he said he understood that this trade in this class of machinery was not at present in a very flourishing condition.
ENGINEERING - RUSSIA,Sir Arthur Balfpur said he believed that it had improved slightly, and there was a better call for parts of agricultural machinery from Sheffield.Business interests generally, Sir A. Balfour observed, felt that the recognition of the Russian Government was one step forward, but they would be unwilling to grant credits, unless pre-war debts were recognised.   He mentioned that the Germans had been in the habit of giving Long oredit to the Russians,. e*g. for 18 months or two . years, and in this way had succeeded largely in forcing us out of the Russian trade.   It would, however, not be feasible to allow them such credits nowadays.The President remarked that the Russian Oo-operative Societies seemed to offer prospeots of placing orders and duly making payment, if-long-term credits were granted.Sir Arthur Balfour replied that until they have assets in this country as a security, he thought they would not get substantial credits.The President said he had heard that large quantities of timber were on quays in the White Sea ready to ship here when the Ice breaks..Sir Arthur Balfour remarked that, following immediately upon the recognition of the Russian Government, a speech of Zinovleff&apos;s was reported,&apos; of a character calculated to undo all the progress that had been made.- Sir Arthur Shirley Bern observed that one of the difficulties with regard&quot; to Russian timber was that, in certain cases, timber which had been paid for by British      y firms had been confiscated and then offered for sale again to those same firms; and incidents of this kind naturally rankled.Sir William Clark remarked that Russia was now said to be exporting furs to the value of over  500,000 per annum.Cdl. Armstrong, speaking from the point of view of the Federation of the British Industries, said that slight signs of improvement had shown themselves in certain trades.     With regard to the general engineering situation, he could not altogether endorse the view that there had been&apos;any notable increase in activity;   orders were still very slow in coming , forward, though there were plenty of enquiries, which, however, did not mature.Much competition was now being met with from France on account of the depreciation of the franc, and the ten-hour day which was being worked there.The Japanese were placing certain orders for re-construo-tion work, he understood, in Germany and elsewhere.abroad; they had stated that they could not accept certain British tenders unless a 15ft reduction were marie in the quotations. There was a prospect of a Japanese reconstruction loan being floated in this country, since it was unlikely that it would
ENGINEERING - JAPANESE RECONSTRUCTION.be raised in the United States on account of the political feeling, or in France on a franc basis.    He would therefore suggest that it might he pointed out to, our Ambassador at Tokio, with a view to his passing on this information to the Japanese, that if they desired to float a loan here, this operation would be much facilitated if more attention were paid to placing orders here rather than in Germany.     At present the Japanese were showing a disinclination to place orders;   they now knew the extent of the damage, but were holding back and were engaged in discussion with German firms.The Electrical Industry in this country was in a flourishing condition.     It was well off last year, but now had been still further assisted by the railway electrification schemes.Reverting to the subject of the Japanese Loan, the President remarked that the proposed action presented some difficulties;   it had not hitherto, he thought, been the practice of the British Government to raise with foreign borrowers the question of spending the proceeds of their loans in this country.     Colonel Armstrong replied that all he would suggest was that the attention of the 1 Japanese should be drawn to the effect of placing orders abroad upon their prospects of raising a loan here.     It was true that Banking interests were usually averse to the imposition of any conditions upon foreign loans, but he &quot;nevertheless thought that it would be well if our Ambassador could be told that the loan would be much more popular In this   country if more money, were spent here. The Japanese had been good customers of ours in the past.Sir Glynn West remarked that the Japanese had not bought engineering products to any extent in this country for the last four years.     They had built up their own organisations and factories to deal with heavy iron and steel, ship-building, and. indeed all branches of the engineering trade.Mr. Hirst had written as follows:-&quot;The continuous and steady improvement in all branches^ &quot;of the Electrical Industry which I reported on from time &quot;to time during last Autumn, came to a stop with the &quot;General Election.     The psychological effect on the country-&quot;of the coming of a Labour Government caused a general &quot;feeling of uncertainty, which showed itself in a severe &quot;fall of securities.     This caused a loss of capital, which &quot;seemed to reduce the purchasing power of the public. &quot;The constitution of the new Government, as well as certain &quot;declarations of prominent Ministers, have re-established &quot;confidence, and one was justified in the hope.that, after &quot;the usual lull which prevails in our Industry between the, -1 &quot;middle of December and, say, the 10th January, normal     * &quot;conditions would again prevail.     One had. hoped that &quot;business would continue at the rato at which it left off &quot;at the beginning of December;   these hopes have not yet &quot;been realised.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING -&quot;Trade generally in the ordinary electrical supplies is &quot;below the average, yet a certain amount of relief has come &quot;through the additional work which Housing Schemes and the &quot;British Empire Exhibition have introduced.&quot;On the Heavy Engineering side of the electrical &quot;industry full employment can be recorded, mainly due to &quot;work which has been placed by Local Authorities, Government &quot;Departments, Railway Companies, etc.     The actual &quot;industrial work is still unsatisfactory, and signs of &quot;improvement have for the moment been wiped out through the &quot;Railway Strike and the threat of other Labour dispates &quot;vdiich are in the air and, in consequence, are checking &quot; enterprise.&quot;As far as employment generally is concerned, since &quot;June last we have added to our workers at the rate of 200 &quot;per month.&quot;Export business i3 still very dull, though an improve-&quot;ment has been noticeable in business with the Overseas &quot;Dominions.     Trade with non-British countries is deplorably &quot;little.    An unsatisfactory feature has been the growing &quot;competition of Germany, particularly in South Africa and &quot;India, as well as the keen competition of America in the &quot;Overseas Dominions.&quot;
- NON-FERROUS METALS.Mr. Tait wrotej--&quot;The last three months have not been unsatisfactory in &quot;the Non-Ferrous Metal Trade, and demand, except for Copper, has &quot;been.good.   Prices for the other metals are high, but thev have &quot;not apparently reached levels at which the volume of manufacture &quot;is restricted or at whioh substitutes are sought for.&quot;CopperApparent consumption is much betterc   In 1922 the &quot;consumption of imported Virgin Copper was 26,500 tons, and in &quot;1923 76,800 tons, but against this must be set the fact that &quot;sales of Scrap in 1923 were probably only 60$ of those in 1922, : &quot;However, it is doubtful if the picture is quite as black as the &quot;Birmingham trade paints it, although, .with the exception of the &quot;wire makers, the demand for manufactured. Copper goods remains &quot;below normal,   Germany has made and continues to make severe &quot;inroads-on the Indian sheet trade, and British sales are largely &quot;confined to brands which have been so long established as to &quot;command a special price.&quot;Tin.   &apos;The tinplato makers are estimated to be working at 90$ &quot;of their capacity and are well booked forward.   Demand for Tin &quot;for Bolder, white metal, etc. is very satisfactory.&quot;Lead.It is difficult to see any relief from the present &quot;stringent conditions,   From 17/20,000 tons a month is now &quot;necessary to keep the trade supplied and, with a larger &quot;programme of building in prospect, supplies are oertainly &quot;inadequate.   The xmrest in Mexico is consequently very serious, &quot;as we rely upon 8/9,000 tons of Lead a month from this source. &quot;If shipments are restricted from Tampico, competition for &quot;Spanish Lead from the Continental manufacturers is immediately &quot;felt.......&quot;Spelter.The present price is probably higher than the demand &quot;warrants, and is duo to short supplies rather than a great &quot;expansion in consumption.   The galvanizera are estimated to be &quot;working at 70$ of their oapasity, but tho demand from the Braes &quot;trade, as already outlined, is unsatisfactory.   The oxide and &quot;pigment manufacturers are -active.&quot;Aluminium..Demand for the metal is strong, owing to aotivity in      , &quot;the motor trade at home and abroad.   The sheet business is &quot;fairly active for the same reason, but the cooking utensil &quot;business is still suffering from Continental competition.   The &quot;demand for transmission cables for electrical power purposes is ^ &quot;expanding satisfaotorilyii
Mr. sutollffe Smith said with regard to the wool fcex&amp;ile industry in this&apos; country, that the combing branch was occupied to the extent of some 50 or 60^ of capacity the yarn-spinning branch to 70)&apos;i, and the weaving branch to 50jJ, Since last August there had been some slight improvement as regards unemployment and underemployment,   In the Bradford district the total number unemployed or on short-time last August totalled 13,457, as against 9,569 unemployed and 1,925 under-employed in January this year,Th6 dearness of the raw material was a serious source of trouble to the industry.(   During the last few months the rise had amounted to some 50$ for the lower qualities of wool and 25)a for the good qualities.   The world had consumed during the last few years half a million bales in exoess of production, and production was now half a million bales less than the pre-war production.   The normal production of the world amounted to some 8,000,000 bales, of which Australia, New Zealand and the Gape produoed 45)2,   There was now a bigger demand for wool, owing to increased population, and prices were going up,   Before the war America   consumed 550,000,000 lbs, annually, but in 1923, 700,000,000 lbs. with a likelihood of increase. The consumption of wool per head in Europe (apart from Great Britain) amounted to 3 lbs. per head as against 7 lbs. per head  : in the United States.At the Bame time production had fallen off, though he could not altogether say why.   He had spoken to Mr, Bruoe and Mr, Massey on this subject when they were in England, and they expressed the view that wool produotion in Australia and New Zealand must be increased.   The rise in price would automa---tically assist this tendency.   During the past year some 350,000 bales of the Australian clip had been lost, on account of the drought.With regard to the competition in wool textiles which had been experienced from Prance, he observed that the French were now finding difficulty.in giving delivery, and British manu-faoturers were recovering some Jost ground.Enquiries from China and the East were better, though.high prices were still a hindrance.   Bradford was now taking up other.; trades, such as the artificial silk trade, which he thought would loom large in the future, and was at present doing well in these.. Generally speaking, there, was a more hopeful foutlook among merchants and manufacturers, and there was some improvement, as already mentioned, in the figures of unemployment.
Mr. Holroyd said that the improvement in the Cotton Industry which he had reported at the last meeting had, unfortunately, not continued.   As President of the Cotton Spinners1 Federation, he had urged members to continue short-time production; but certain members had received good orders, and it had thus been found impossible to secure the required percentage majority in the Federation to continue short-time over-production had resulted and matters were now as bad as before.   Shortage of raw material was the chief cause of the trouble.In this connection he would remark that an increase in prices did not always result in an increase in the production of raw cotton, since United States growers found that they could actually get more money for a smaller crop: consequently, they did not exert themselves to increase their production.It was now known what lands In the Empire were suitable for cotton-growing, but the lack of transport . facilities was checking progress at present, Improved communications by, road, rail and water were required.   If these oould be obtained, he was confident that the Empire could produce all the cotton needed in this country.   An unusual feature of the present situation was the large importation of cotton yarn from France and Belgium, at 2d. or 3d. a lb. cheaper than we oan produce.   Nominally a 48-hour week was the rule in these countries, but in reality they worked more. .He had been present a week previously, at an International Conference on the subject of hours, at which practically all countries except Germany were represented, and it turned out that they all worked . longer hours than we didj In Switzerland asad- the hours were as many as 53 per week, while in Holland and Belgium it was possible, with the consent of the Government and the operatives, to extend the working week.The President said he was alive to the difference between the existence of a Convention and its enforcement, but tho British Government were inclined at present to consider If they could not get the principal foreign oountries to ratify the Eight Hours&apos; Convention and put it into operation.   Our experience in factory legislation had shown that these improvements in working conditions could only be brought into force gradually.   He thought that the continental countries were slowly improving their factory legislation.It was remarked that the Cotton Trade in France is at present working a 10 hours&apos; day, and Col. Armstrong observed that skilled Belgian workmen who live near the French frontier, make a systematic practice of crossing it daily in order to be able to work in France under the 10-hours rule and to earn wages in French francs.Mr. Holroyd said he had heard from a Swiss spinner that by giving his operatives a week&apos;s holiday with pay, he had Induced them to aocept a regular working week of 52-j hours at the same wages as for 48.
CONFIDENTIAL.With regard to the question of -Cotton growing within the Empire, the President remarked that the Government was taking up the question of african Railways.   Mr. Holroyd said it was realized that the necessary supply of cotton could not be obtained from Empire sources within the next few years, but there was also a good prospect of obtaining supplies from Brazil, which had proved to be one of the finest countries in the world for cotton growing, and indeed better than the best lands in the United States.   Suitable land existed in Brazil   near the coast, and also in the States of Sao Paulo and Rio, where communications were good.   The cotton produced in Northern Brazil was, if anything, of excessively long staple, and it was the shorter staple quality produced in the South of the country that we. particularly require.   The Brazilian Government had taken up &apos; the question of grading and marking, and had engaged a Liverpool expert to advise them on the subject; they had also opened six Instructional Colleges for this work.   British Guiana also offered possibilities of cotton growing, but not much was coming from there yet.SirShirley Benn remarked that before the war he hacj. been impressed&apos; by&apos; statements made by a delegation from British Guiana, as to the possibilities of Cotton Growing in the hinterland;   He was convinced that crops from the United States would become progressively smaller, on account of the, emigration of negroes from the Southern States.Sira G^bertjjrindl^e said that the root problem in Britilh Guiana was*TEaT&quot;of population; unless this could be increased, any greater production was out of the question.   The Colonial Office were &quot;attempting to re^open the question of emigration from India; to be effective, however, this must be on a large scale.With regard to the Eight Hours&apos; Convention, the President remarked that the question of ratifying this had been raised at a recent International Labour Conferenoe at Geneva. Mr. Holroyd remarked that it would be a serious matter if, in present&quot;&quot;circumstances, we took any step in advance of continental countries which would increase the severity of their competition.   At present a 48-hour week was observed in the British cotton industry but by an arrangement between employers and employees longer hours could be worked, if work were forthcoming:The President said he realised the necessity for concurrent action.   We were confronted with the choice between:&apos;ssouring a 48-hour week, all round, or reverting to longer hours ourselves.Jt was remarked that the attitude of the United States, which was standing out of the International Labour Organisation, would need to be taken into account in dealing with this question. - .     ;
Mr. Brooke said that, so far, the Ministry of&apos; Transport had only the published railway receipts for January, and naturally these had been much affected by the strike.   Figures of traffic were steadily improving last year, and indeed October showed the heaviest oarryings of goods train traffic since the Ministry of Transport had Btarted its statistics in January, 1920.   The figures for November were fairly well maintained, though not quite up to the level of October.   There had been a marked increase last year in the carryings of coal, ore, and iron and steel.   This now showed some tendency to diminish, but was balanced to some extent by increased carryings of finished goods and general merchandise.Sir Arthur Watson wrotes-&quot;During the eleven months ended November, 1923, (the &quot;latest period for which tonnages for Great Britain are &quot;available) there was a considerable improvement compared with &quot;the corresponding period of 1922.&quot;General Merchandise tonnages increased by 11.31$ &quot;Coal, Coke and Patent Fuel tonnagesincreased by........................ 12.42$&quot;Other Minerals tonnages increased by..... 29.74$&quot;giving a total increase for all classes of Freight of 15.00$.&quot;It is anticipated that the improvement will also be &quot;reflected in the December results when available, and that &quot;the year 1933 will shew a decided advance in carryings over &quot;1922.&quot;In regard to industries such as Iron and Steel, Carriage &quot;and Wagon building, Machinery and Engineering, a more &quot;pronounced feeling of confidence prevails, but this in the &quot;main is attributed to the large orders which the Railway &quot;Companies have placed, together with those of the Crown &quot;Colonies, and the Dominions and Local Authorities, in the &quot;national effort to alleviate unemployment.,&quot;Although the recent partial strike of enginemen &quot;temporarily disorganised business, there is indication that, &quot;given peace in the industrial world, the improvement already &quot;manifested during 1923 will continue&quot;.COAL.Mr. Evan Williams wrote:- ---&quot;It is difficult to give any clear indication as to &quot;pro&apos;spects in the Coal Trade at the moment,   The output has &quot;been seriously reduced by the Railway strike, and there.must &quot;be a strong demand for a short period in consequence of this, &quot;and prices of coal for export have risen temporarily. European &quot;countries are covering their barest necessities only.   The &quot;fall in exchanges, and the increasing production in the Ruhr &quot;and in the North French coalfields make future business more    * &quot;and more difficult, while American competition is beooming &quot;more intense, in South America   in particular.   Notwithstanding &quot;this the outputs were maintained and absorbed up to the &quot;Railway Strike and the level of prices was not materially &quot;changed.RAILWAYS
9 Qt goal.&quot;The real weakness in the ooal trade is and has been &quot;since 1920 due to the fall in home demand, and until the &quot;large coal consuming industries recover their prosperity &quot;there can be no substantial improvement.&quot;It does not seem possible to increase our exports of &quot;coal and the restoration of. pro-occupation production in the &quot;Ruhr will make a reduction in quantity and prices the more &quot;probable event&quot;.Mr. Murray wrote:-&quot;Far Eastern Markets. .&quot;During the past two months there has been a steady &quot;improvement in the demand for Textiles of all kinds, and the &quot;Markets generally are muoh more &quot;healthy&quot; (financially and &quot;otherwise) than they, have been for a very long time,   It is satisfactory to record that there has been nothing in the way &quot;of a &quot;boom&quot;, but there has undoubtedly been a steady, &quot;gradually increasing confidence.   Prices on this side are, &quot;in the opinion of dealers abroad, still too high to warrant . &quot;their purchasing large quantities for distant delivery, and &quot;for the moment they are contenting themselves by buying ftheir immediate requirements.&quot;The prospects of business in these Markets appear to me to be quite good.&quot;A Report upon the Business and Trade Conditions of Great Britain during 19S3 has been oommunicated by Mr. Beaumont Pease and 1b attached as an Annex at the end or these Minutes.
JM.hi 3CHIM - TRADEMARKS...Sir Arthur Balfour1 said that a question of urgent importance had&apos;arisen Tri China, in regard to the Trade Marks Law.   The Cutlers Company of Sheffield had been pressing the Chinese Government on this question, and had presented to them a draft law.   A law had now been passed, but It was apparently not in accord with the Mackay Treaty, and did not meet our requirements.   He hoped that the Board of Trade would take the matter up.   The -resident replied that the matter was receiving the Board&apos;s serious attention.colonel\ Armstrong said that The Federation of British Industries&apos; hao&quot;&quot;Vfso received representations on this subject. British traders would find themselves compelled either (a) to register their marks In China, or (b) to place themselves in the hands of the Chinese while negotiations went on. He suggested that there was urgent need for the Government to take action in this matter.Hr. Sutcliffe Smith observed that the new Chinese Trade Marks&quot;LTw&apos; was&apos;mb a el led on European lines.   Hitherto, the Chinese had had no law on the subject, marks only being lodged with an office in Shanghai.   The present law would bring (cases in regard to trade marks into the Chinese Courts. If British firms did not register their marks, the Chinese , would appropriate them and register them as their own. This was an all important matter in regard to our trade with China, extending to Tibet, Manchuria and the South.   In these circumstances British traders were naturally inclined to register all their marks at once, under the new Chinese law, but the British Government, who presumably desired to retain some measure of extra-territorial jurisdiction, had deprecated this, and said that the result of doing so would be to weaken their hands In negotiations with the Chinese.In reply to a question by the President as to whether any analogoxis difficulties had been experienced in Japan, Mr. Sutcliffe Smith said that he had spoken to a Japanese business delegation on this subject.   Their law was in terms good, but was badly interpreted by their courts.   This matter had, however, been taken up with their Registrar, and,he thought some improvement had resulted.Returning to the question of trade marks in China, Mr. Sutcliffe Smith said that any delay might have serious consequences, as it was at present open to the Chinese to have Brit-1 sh   marks registered as their own.   In his yiew, the best course would be to induce them to take a British expert adviser into their service, and to give some little extension of time.Sir Arthur Balfour   said that there could be no more important&quot; question for&quot;&quot;British trade in China than that of trade marks, since our whole business there was built up on th them.lv;r. Sutcliffe Smith confirmed this, remarking that in a recent&quot;&quot;case&quot; &apos;vvhere&quot;TaTs&quot;&quot;fTriii&apos; s piece goods had been sold by auction in China, some branded, others unbranded, the unbranded pieces had fetched some 10/- per piece less.   The Japanese were particularly given to infringing trade marks, and. were not as honest in this respect as the Chinese; indeed they imitated British piece goods for sale in China.
CONFIDENTIAL.----------------- CHINA - TRADEMARKS. ,Six1 Arthur Balfour said that he had had a good deal of expeFIoh&quot;ce&apos;&quot;of^aftempted imitation of British Marks;   it was found more satisfactory to approach the Trade Guilds and organisations In Japan on this subject than the Courts a A similar method had been followed in China with better success than in Japan0Mrt Sutcliffe Smith   desired to emphasize that time was the essential&quot;factor in this question of Chinese Trade Marksj   the Chinese had the right to appropriate our Marks now.   Ho mentioned that a meeting was to be held at the Patent Office on the following day at which the China Association, the Federation of British Industries, the Association of Chambers of Commerce and the Bradford and Manchester Chambers of Commerce would be representedo   There had also been a large meeting at the Federation of British Industries on the previous day, at which a strong desire was expressed by those present that they should, at once, register their Marks under the new Chinese Law, but the Government had asked them not to do so as this would weaken their hands in negotiations.   All these points would no doubt be considered at the forthcoming meeting at the i     Patent 0ffice*   The President said that the matter was one which it was desirable to press on to a decisions
-ANNEX.Mr. Beaumont Pease Wroto-j-&quot;I enclose a copy of a report   upon business and trade-conditions which 1 have had prepared.   Since the report-was prepared, conditions have still further improved and the feeling of uneasiness which was prevalent recently and which had a disturbing effect in the financial world seems largely to have disappeared.   This has been indicated in the recent considerable rise in the price of &quot;sterling vis-a-vis the dollar.&quot;1- Report upon the Business and Trade Conditions of the Country during 1923:-Agriculture has once again experienced a year of depression, although perhaps 1923 has proved slightly better than 1922*   A further doorease has taken plaoe in the arable area, and that under wheat has now shrunk to less than it was before the war,   Stock feeding and grazing have continued unremunerative, but on the other hand profits from sheep farming have proved quite satisfactory.   Fruit growers have had a particularly bad season, owing to the widespread failure of almost every variety of fruit, but hop growers have done well with their crops, though the prices fixed by the Controller have not given, satisfaction.   Dairy farmers have just about held their own, but at a lower level of price on their milk contracts.   In the grain trade the year ha3 been very unsatisfactory both for merchants and millers.   Even by careful trading it has been difficult to earn overhead expenses.   The wheat crops of the world are large, and the Plate maize crop alBO promises satisfaotorily,   These large crops should furnish opportunities for profit which have been lacking in the past twelve months,   Live stock markets at the end of the year have been upset by serious and widespread outbreaks of. foot-and-mouth disease, which, however, fortunately now shows signs of abating.   Trade has been dis-organized by Government restrictions, consequent upon these outbreaks.The Brewing industry has had a fairly active and satisfactory year on the wholof in spite of the general industrial inaction.    The modification .of the beer duty in the Budget was regarded as insufficient to cause any great expansion of business which does not seem likely to occur until it is possible to reduce the price of beer still further. *Cotton,   At the beginning of the year importers found business very difficult.   Trade in Manchester was slow, and demands were small; the supply of the raw article in America was inadequate, and prices in the States were relatively high.   In the autumn, however, trade in lancashire improved; some mills began to run full time and a definite improvement in the demand set in.   Speaking, generally, it is considered that Liverpool traders in ootton must have done well., as it has been evident for a long time that the supply will not be
sufficient for the wants of the world, and in these circumstances, it is unlikely, as a business proposition, that anyone has been &quot;short&quot; of   cotton.   It is thought that importers must have made money this season on all cotton that has been sold.   Unsold cotton in warehouse, or \ on the way to this country, should be good property and realize a profit if it can be sold promptly, as it probably consists of grades and styles that will be scarce and difficult to find, either here or in American during the remainder of the season.With regard to prices, at the beginning of 1923 Fully Middling American on spot stood at 15,40d. per lb. and during the first few months there was no great change in values.   In the middle of June there was an advance to 17.28d,, but a decline followed, and by August prioes had fallen nearly 4d... per lb.     In the autumn, an upward movement set in, and, after very violent fluctuations in the early part of December, values became steadier towards the close of the year, the final quotation for Fully Middling Amerioan on spot being 21.06d.per lb.   In the Egyptian market, F.G.F, Sakellaridis on spot, the price of which at the commencement of the year was 17,80d. per lb, after not very wide fluctuations during the year, except in November and December, was finally quoted at 24,50d, per&apos; lb.The outstanding feature of the Wool textile industry during the whole year has been the domination of the market by raw materials.   In. 1922 abnormal supplies of merinos were absorbed, and a comparatively small quantity was carried over to 1923, so that the turnover in 1923 could not be bo large as in the preceding year.   There was a strong demand for merinoB at the beginning of the year, and the outlook was encouraging, but a slackness became apparent in May and June, and there was a fall in prices of tops and yarns.   This was due to the impossibility of doing business at prices proportion-ate to the cost of raw material, which was forced up by foreign demands, and,, in fact, it was easier to sell the wool in its raw state.   Notwithstanding the May and June slackness, prioes were well maintained at the London Sales, and in September the tendency to revert to crossbreds, which had been developing for some months, became very pronounced, and prioes of this class of wool hardened considerably, and by the&apos; end of the year prices both for merinos and crossbreds reached their highest point.   Statistically the position is sound, taking into account the amount of wool available and the demands for consumption to be made upon it.There has been a good demand for the English Clip, and growers had no difficulty in disposing of it at prices well in advance of those obtaining in 1922, Prices have further advanced since the country sales. -As in the previous year, business in the piece*goods trade has been very uneven and has been hampered by lack of confidence, in consequence of which there has been a general tendency to proceed warily.   There has been competition in piece goods from the Continent, the lower conversion costs and depreciated&apos; currencies having enabled Continental spinners and manufacturers to undersell British producers.   Towards the end of the year there was an improved demand for piece goods, more particularly in crossbred cloths, and looms are better employed,
. There is a general feeling in the trade that the prospects for 1924 are encouraging, and that, although the year Just closed has been trying, its difficulties have been successfully surmounted.On the whole the Hosiery trade has, perhaps, not had such a prosperous year m T923 a3 during the previous twelve months.   Doth the spring and summer seasons were adversely affected by unsuitable weather conditions, but during the latter half of the year the situation showed Borne improvement, and winter orders kept manufacturers quite busy.   Advancing prices of yarn proved unsettling, and the market has had to complain of large importations of foreign-made hosiery.The Carpet Industry has continued to flourish, Trade has been &quot;good in all departments, and there seems every prospect of a continuance of the prosperity enjoyed for several years past.   It is interesting to note that the higher grades of.carpets have been most in demand.   Orders continued to come in freely at the end of the year0   It is very satisfactory to find a most amicable relationship exist in between employers and operatives.In the Soft Goods   trade the year has not been by any means a satisfactory one, as continued heavy taxation, the large amount of unemployment, and consequent financial stringency, have necessitated the practice of the utmost economy by the public.   The importation of German and foreign goods at exceptionally low prices has seriously Interfered With profitable trading.   There have also been several heavy failures in the trade recently, and the consequent flooding of the market with goods that could not be absorbed&apos; owing to the low spending power of the public caused a severe cut in prices.   In the Mantle and Costume section, the trade for the last half-year has been the most difficult cinoe the big slump that occurred after the war, largely due to the importation and advertisement of foreign materials and goods at   prioes at which it would be Impossible for English firms to produce to show a profit.   The experience of Silk houses in 1923 has been anything but satisfactory, and it is feared that the trade is in for a bad time, which is only now beginning to be felt.   Competition has been very keen, and . foreign houses, owing to the rate of exchange being in their favour, have secured most of the orders.   In Dress Goods and woollen Materials turnovers have been steady, although warehousemen have had to do double the amount of work to earn the same profits as last year.   The fact that fashion, which, as usual,&quot;has been the controlling influence in the trade, demanded more materials for prevailing styles, was of groat benefit to the &quot;piece&quot; warehousemen, and was, perhaps, the most outstanding feature of the year.    The year haB not been very satisfactory for the Gloye trade.   Although the under-current has been a little more stable than was the case during 1922, prices generally, as well as business, seem to have gradually   fallen away.
ThQ I^?e industry has continued in a moat unsatisfactory condition during the past year, and has again had to complain of very severe Continental competition.    The recommendation of the Board of Trade Committee that an import duty should be imposed for at least five years was welcomed by manufacturers.Little extension of activity has occurred in the Leather trade, tanners and curriers continuing to experience quiet times.   Harness and saddlery manufacturers are likewise unable to report much improvement, but there was considerable activity in the fancy leather trade during the last quarter of the year, the Christmas season&apos;s orders being more numerous than usual, and German competition less keen.The encouraging signs of improvement in the Boot and Shoe trade noted twelve months ago hardly materialized,&apos; and on the whole 19S3 can scarcely be described as a year of much prosperity,   Prospects became somewhat brighter in the autumn, and a more hopeful feeling was evidenced, largely as a result of the Shoe and Leather Fair,Under the influence of a steadily increasing general demand abroad, together with a revival in the large coal-consuming industries, the Coal trade started 1923 with encouraging prospects.    The &quot;Ruhr adventure created an additional strong demand for fuel, and caused a considerable rise   in prices,    The result was that, for the early months of the year, the industry enjoyed great prosperity.   During the summer demand naturally fell away and was accompanied by falling prices.   In the autumn, however, a recovery was again evidenced, exports once more increased and stocks were rapidly depleted, at the end of the year outputs continued at a high levelj but a jull occurred in forward contracting, many large buyers refusing to pay the prices asked for 1924,   Activity was maintained, however, the demand for export showing no signs of falling offj while the inland trade was aided by the improvement at the ship-yards and steel and iron worksB   It is interesting to note that the total output last year came to within 9 million tons of that of 1913, and that 75,000 more men were employed in the industry than in 1813,The Iron and Steel industry has witnessed a somewhat fluctuating time&quot;Tturing 1923.   Tho year opened with considerable activity manifested in all branches of the trade, receiving a further considerable impetus from the Ruhr adventure, which caused orders and output to increase during the early months of the year.    This was   oucceoded, however, by a period of almost complete stagnancy, and the advantage which was obtained from the cessation of German production seemed to have disappeared by the end of the&quot;summer.   In the late autumn, however, a change was again witnessed, and by the end of the year a strong undertone developed, many consumers of pig iron buying well forward.   On the North east coast additional furnaces were put into operation, the total number in blast at the end of the year being 49.   The greater activity in the shipyards subsequent to the settlement of the boiler-makers 1*strike has called for increasing specifications for steel, and orders for railway material have also been placed.
In Scotland the actual output of steel for the year was only slightly less than that of the boom year 1920, but business was confined largely to light makes of material.   Generally speaking, all districts reported   a stronger position and more promising outlook at the end of the year, though since then keen foreign competition has developed in respect of nig iron, semi-manufactured material and steel.   The Tinplate trade has had a very good year, and makers at present are well&quot;supplied with orders, while the works look like being fully employed&quot;&quot; for many months to come.   In the autumn large shipments were made to Japan after the earthquake.   Similarly the Spelter industry has shown improvement, production having been increased and offerings of the&apos;metal well absorbed.Tin Mining, with the prioe of tin touching well over  230 per ton, has received a considerable impetus during the year, the demand from America being very heavy,   Old mines have reopened and new shafts have been sunk.   Good profits have been made from the production and sale of arsenicThe Engineering industry finds its position somewhat improved at trie end of the year as compared with the beginning.-But the difficult times are not yet past.   Machine toolmakers have again had a &quot;lean&quot; year0   At home requirements have not extended much beyond renewals, and the export trade has yielded poor results.Manufacturers of Motor Gars and Cycles    (both motor and pedal) have had a bigger output than in any year since pre-war times.   Large cuts were made in selling prices, which have justified themselves in a bigger turnover.The gradual improvement in the Hardware trade has continued during the year.   Stocks are low and values steady.   More business has been done in builders3 hardware.   The homo market has not afforded a vory profitable field of enterprise, and the best overseas markets have been Australia and Hew Zealand, which have taken substantial supplies.Competition in the Bedstead trade has boen very keen, but there has been an improvement &quot;in both home and export trade of late, and the year closed under somewhat improved conditions. The trade in ships&apos; berths, v;hioh normally, provides a considerable amount of work in Birmingham, was stagnant during the greater part of the year3As regards Shipping there is still a large surplus of tonnage, and the year as a whole has been a depressing!y difficult one for shipowners,   There has been a paucity of^ employment, freights have been at low levels, and, except in special cases, unremunerative,   Many old vessels have, however,^ been sold for breaking-up purposes during the last year.including such notable Transatlantic liners as the &apos;&apos;St. Paul;&quot;   &apos;lndiarf , &quot;Orcana,&quot; etc.   This process of scrapping obsolete tonnage seems likely to continue and possibly increase during tho coming year,
The position, however, with regard to well-managed, efficient shipping property to-day is apparently slightly improving,   The inactivity in the Shipbuilding industry has been intensified by labour troublesj throughout nearly the whole of 1923 the yards were merely engaged in working off old contracts,   During the last month of the year, however, a decided change for the better occurred, contracts being placed at most of the yard3, the work ensuring a satisfactory start for the New Year.   The orders that have been placed are the outcome of the realization by shipowners that much of the existing tonnage is out of date, and that, if they are to hold their own in the carrying trade of the world when the revival comes, the old boats must be replaced by new ones, The recovery at the yards has been greatly helped by the settlement of the dispute with the boiler-makers, and it is earnestly to be desired that further labour troubles will not arise and spoil what has every appearance of being a genuine revival in shipbuilding.   Some shipbuilders think that,in many cases, the skilled workman in the yard or the engineering works is working very nearly as well as in pre-war times.Dry docks and repairing yards are gradually getting back some of the work which has been going abroad, and it is to be hoped that conditions with regard to repairing labour will also improve.   It would redound to the benefit of all concerned, and enable the repairing yards to secure the work which would otherwise go abroad,With regard to the extraordinary advances which are being made in this country with the Diesel engine for marine propulsion, engineers have been largely developing their Diesel engine programmes, and all the large British marine engineering works are actively developing their resources of dealing with this problem,     Diesel-enginod vessels will undoubtedly form a considerable portion of the shipbuilding programmes during this year, judging by the statistics which come before us from time to time.   It is hoped that the energy of our constructors, designers and engineers will quickly regain for this country the old predominance which it previously had in marine Bteam engine s.There has been some expansion in the Building trade, and the outlook is considerably better.   Brick makers in the Birmingham district have been regularly employed during the past six months,   A large proportion of the bricks made have gone into publio development works, and not in the erection of houses, factories, etc.   But the trade is busier as a whole,Timber.   The year for the import trade commenced with a developing demand and advancing prices, and remained in a  * satisfactory condition for the first six months.   During the later months of the year demands slackened, but stocks are not excessive, and on the whole prospects are favourable,   Financially the position is considered to be sound, although merchants complain of the difficulty of getting money in.
39O 1)1In the Silver and Electro-plate industry, Sheffield reports that the operations of the past year have been anything but satisfactory to those firms who have regard for the town&apos;s reputation for hijh class material and workraenship.   A considerable proportion of works have--cerried on without earning profit.   The output of the whole trade recorded a substantial increase, but the proportion of it which consisted of cheap lines was far larger than in any previous year, and this for the mo3t part came from the smaller makers.   MakerB of silver and plated hollow-ware have fared worse than in any previous years.   Birmingham &apos; reports that the Jowellery trade has passed through another very trying year, and there iB a great deal of unemployment in the jewellery quarter.   Electroplaters have found demand inconstant.While most of the branches of the Glass industry had a bigger turnover than in 1922, the trade&quot; as a whole is not in a very strong condition.   A good deal of capital sunk in it since&apos;the war is making only a very moderate return. There.is still a considerable trade in internal lighting and table glass for Bhips, and the prospects are steadily improving.As regards Sea Pishing, the year has not been good, weather conditions being adverse.   Both the mackerel and pilchard seasons were very poor, but smaller landings than usual of herrings were remedied to some extent by the realization of better prices.Considerable improvement is shown In the China Clay trade, as may be gathered from the fact that the general result of the first half of the year was the best for a long time,   America has again been a good customer.
