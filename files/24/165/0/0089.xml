Copy So.,  )JInquiry into Lunacy Arrangements, ,135 ( 24) Memorandum by the Minister of Health.The recent case of   Harnett v. Bond and Anr. has given rise to considerable uneasiness in the minds of the public, and there is a widespread demand for an inquiry into the existing safeguards for preventing sane persons from being certified and detained and for securing that insane persons when recovered are discharged.Doctors too, in view of the decision in that caBe, are shewing a marked reluctance to certifying persons who in their opinion are of unsound mind and proper persons to be detained for treatment.I therefore propose that a Royal Commission should be appointed with the following terms of reference:-&quot;(l)   To enquire into the existing law and administrative machinery in connection with the certification and detention of persons who are or are alleged to be of unsound mind; (2)     To consider the extent to which provision is or should be made for the treatment without certification of persona suffering from mental disorder, and to make recoELmendations,&quot; I include (2) in the terms of reference because it is a matter whioh has been raised in the House of Commons, is exciting much public Interest and can most conveniently be dealt with in this connection.I suggest that the membership of the Commission should be limited, to six, that the Chairman should be a lawyer,
and that one doctor   (not a mental doctor hut a man of high standing in the profession), one wCuian and one representative of the working classes should he appointed, together with two men of experience in the administration of public affairs, I should propose to appoint a   Secretary from the Department,In view of the terms of reference proposed, I think the Commission might be at once appointed, although the appeal in the case mentioned has not yet been heard.     The facts of that case will naturally not be considered by the Commission so long as it is sub judice, but it appears to me to be inevitable that the Commission must hear evidence as to other cases of alleged wrongful detention, and the proposed terms of reference will enable this to be done so far as it is requisite to carry cut the task entrusted to the   Commission, It will, however, be necessary to appoint a strong   Chairman if evidence of this kind is to be kept within reasonable limits,(intld.) J.W.Ministry of Health, March 11th, 19248
