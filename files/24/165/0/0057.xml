(This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;;)B GRET.CABINET..P. 155(34).SUMMER TIME,Memorandum by the Home Secretary,The Summer Time Act of 1913 gave power to make annual Orders in Council as to Summer Time &quot;during&apos;the continuance of the pre Bent war&quot;.   By the V.rar Emergency Laws Continuance Act the power was extended for a period of 1 year after the termination of the war, and it accordingly expired on 51st August, 1922.   For the years 1913-22 the following were the periods fixed for Summer Time:-1918.     24th March - 30th September.1919.     30th March - 29th September.1920.     28th March - 27th September extended to25th October for coal stoppage.1921.       3rd April -   3rd October.1922.     23th March -   8th October. In view of the serious difficulties and inconveniences in connection with the transport of passengers and mails arising from the different periods of Summer Time in foroe in Great Britain and neighbouring countries, a conference was held in November 1921 between representatives of the Home Office and other Government Departments interested and representatives of the French and Belgian Governments.    It was agreed to fix a uniform period of Summer Time for the 3 countries, viz.. from the last Saturday in March until the first Saturday in October.   This was in fact a compromise, being longer than the period recommended by the Departmental Committee of 1917 but shorter than the period of Summer Time (from 15th March to ,35th October) then in force in1913.31st may 1st October.1917.8th April - 17th September,
-2*. %Qf.&apos;        &apos; O uFrance, but the French Government consented to give up part of this period provided the British Summer Time was not less than 6 months and included the whole of September.   The period for 1922 was fixed in accordance with this agreement.As the powers given by the Act of 1916 expired at the end of August, 1922, it was necessary to introduce and pass legislation making Summer Time permanent in the session of 1922, and the Bill for that purpose, which was introduced in the Lords, and reached the Commons in June 1922, embodied the period agreed upon with the French and Belgian Governments.   The Bill was met with great opposition from the agricultural interests, and its supporters failed to realise that they were in danger of losing Summer Time and did not exert themselves very effectually in its favour.At the same time the course of events in France threw serious difficulties in the way of the Bill.   The French Government introduced a Bill to make Summer Time permanent in accordance with the agreement, but it was defeated in the Chamber, with the result that when the. British Bill was before the House of Commons there was no legal authority in existence for the continuance of Summer Time in France after 1922, and no one could say what would happen.   This naturally rendered it more difficult for the Secretary of State to resist the pressure of the representatives of agrioulture for a shortened period of Summer Time in this country;   and in moving the 2nd reading he undertook before the Committee stage to try and come to an arrangement between the urban and agricultural interests as/to the period to be fixed.   The period finally inserted in the Bill was from the 3rd Saturday in April to the 3rd Saturday in September,  and this was accepted by the agricultural representatives in the House as a settlement.   The Bill was also made an annual one*Since the passing of the Bill in July 1922 there has been a marked change in the position in two respects.(1) Actual experience in 192S of the shortened period of summer-time led to wide-spread &quot;complaints from town-workers and
the urban interests generally.   The cessation in the middle of September was particularly unpopular^ as it fell in the midst of a holiday month;    and it is understood that it was a matter of very great difficulty and inconvenience to the railway companies to revise their time-tables while they were still busy with holiday traffic.   This aspect of the case was represented by a large and influential deputation which was received by Mr. Bridgeman in November,  1925.   Thg(&amp;. object was to press for the period to be extended so as to be from the 1st Sunday in April till the 1st Sunday in October and for the Act to be made permanent.   The Secretary of State promised to lay these representations before the Cabinet, but said that before doing so he must ascertain the views of those who are opposed to Summer Time, and must consult the Ministry of Agriculture.Mr. Bridgeman&apos;had arranged to receive deputations from bodies representing agriculture, but was prevented from doing so by the General Election-,   The views of the Ministry of Agriculture have however been received, and they are of considerable interest.   The Ministry say, referring to a discussion of the question at a meeting of the Council^ of Agriculture in December, 1923:*&apos;&quot;It appears that farmers on the whole now recognise that in face of the overwhelming opinion of the urban community it is useless to object to summer time as an institution, and that they realise that any opposition to be effective should/be concentrated on securing modifications of the period.   The Ministry is of opinion that the interests of agriculture are not seriously prejudiced by the operation of summer time in the four months May to August, when the period of daylight is sufficiently&quot;long to allow, when required, of fairly convenient adjustments being made in the times of starting and finishing work, and further that there are less objections to an extension beyond August than to a    &apos; commencement earlier in the year.&quot;
t\ Q o. .: - &apos;       ,:3 0 0This is confirmed by a resolution sent to the Secretary of State by the Council of the Central and Associated Chambers of Agriculture, which is as follows&quot;The Council recommends that the Act shall operate from the first Sunday in May until the first Sunday in September, but if it be extended beyond that date it should continue until the last Sunday in October on account of the potato harvest&quot;0(3) The situation in Prance has also changed (and in this question Belgium follows the lead of Prance).   In May, 1923, a Bill for the establishment of Summer Time was at last passed; and in July the French Government proposed a conference with a view to establishing uniformity between Prance. Belgium, and Great Britain.   This was at once accepted by HoMo. Government, but until very recently the French Government took no further action in the matter.   How however the conference has been fixed for the 10th instant, and it is necessary to decide what attitude the British representatives shall adopt, bearing in mind that the present period of Summer Time being fixed by statute,  legislation will be necessary to effect any alteration however small.   Probably however it would reduce the difficulty of passing an amending Act if this were for the purpose of carrying out an international agreement for uniform Summer Time.It is to be observed :-(1) that uniformity of period between Great Britain on the one hand and France&apos;and Belgium on the other is obviously very desirable.   Absence of uniformity gives rise to the greatest inoonvenienoe while it lasts in the transport of mails and passengers, and it is understood that as the timing of boat trains necessarily affects the. whole train service, the inconveniences are not confined to persons travelling to and from the Continent but extend to every one who uses the Southern lines.
(2) that the Government will certainly be strongly pressed by the urban interests to extend Summer time.so.as to cover the period April-September, and that the demand will be stronger for extension in the autumn (i.e, to the end of September) than in the spring.(5) that the opposition of the farmers shows signs of weakening, in England at any rate, and that&apos; they also - if they cannot get rid of Summer time altogether - would look with less disfavour upon an extended period in autumn than in spring. It is suggested therefore that the British delegates should be instructed to endeavour to obtain uniformity with France and Belgium on the basis of an extension of British Summer Time to the end of September or the beginning of -October.A. H*4-th March,  1924.
