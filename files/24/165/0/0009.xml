IS DOC&apos;L-;Ei&apos;IT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,EC RE the.T0&quot;9\C4)HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE,iyGenS^a Convention as to the use of White Lead in Painting,1 oMemorandurn by the Minister of Labour,While&apos; I am in general agreement with the proposals &amp;i the Horns Secretary (see C.P.53(24)) as to the ravxficat4on of the draft convention concerning the use of White Lead in Pa toting,. -I would, suggest that it -would be preferable that the Government should qualify the proposed official announcement of the intention to ratify the convention.      That is to say, that it should be announced that a Eill will be introduced as soon as possible designed to give effect to the provisions of this draft convention and that should this Bill pass into law without amendments contrary to the provisions of the draft convention, it is then proposed to ratify the convention.If no such condition is attached to the announcement-of intention to ratify and Parliament should for any cause amend the proposed legislation in such a way as it would then no longer give effect to all the provisions of the convent-ion, the Government might be placed in an embarrassing position which could be avoided if the qualification which I have indicated were made at the outset.(Intd,) T.S.Ministry of Labour,, 14&apos;sh Fa bruar-y . 1 ?J 4 ,
