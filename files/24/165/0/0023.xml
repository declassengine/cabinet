[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1924.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 123 (24).MEMORANDUM ON THE  TANGIER  CONVENTION.BRITISH interest in Tangier dates from 1662, when the town became the property of Charles II as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza. The naval authorities of the time were deeply impressed with the strategic value of Tangier and described it as one of the brightest jewels in His Majesty&apos;s Crown. This somewhat romantic interest suffered a temporary eclipse after the evacuation of the fortress in 1684 on the grounds of economy, and has only revived in recent years in a strictly practical form.The principal features in the modern situation of Morocco are the existence of the French protectorate, established in 1912, and the division of the Sultan&apos;s dominions into a French zone and a Spanish zone, with the town and environs of Tangier forming a third zone distinct from the other two, administered on hand-to-mouth lines which gave free play to international suspicion and rivalry.British interest is confined to-day to two aspects, 1 strategic, 2 commercial:-^1. Standing as it does at the western entrance to the Mediterranean, almost, if not actually, within sight of Gibraltar, the fortification of Tangier by some other Power would negative the value of that fortress, and would seriously compromise our lines of communication with India and our Eastern possessions. It has therefore been a cardinal factor in the policy of successive British Governments to prevent Tangier from falling into the hands of any one Power. Thus all the Moroccan treaties since&apos; 1904 to which this country has been a&apos; contracting party, or to which she has acceded, contain provision for the ultimate establishment of a special international regime.2. The commercial importance of Tangier lies in the fact that, when it possesses a proper harbour, it will be not only an important port of call on the Mediterranean routes, but also the main gateway into North Africa and the terminus of the future Tangier-Fez-Dakar Railway. . The volume of British trade with Morocco, for which Tangier would normally be the most convenient port of entry, though inferior to the French, is nevertheless considerable. The aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been to preserve the &quot;open door&quot; for this trade and to encourage its development.In 1912 the negotiations for the establishment of the special regime provided by the treaties were begun between the British, French and Spanish Governments. After prolonged discussion a statute was drawn up; unfortunately, while&apos; the Spanish Government was hesitating to append its signature, the war broke out and relegated the whole question into the background. When, in 1919, it came again to the fore, the situation had materially altered. The French Government claimed that the war itself, and the action which, in view of their special position in Morocco, it had fallen to their lot to take not only in their own interests, but on behalf of the Allies in general, e.g., the expulsion of the German and Austrian Ministers, the sequestration of enemy property, the suppression of enemy intrigue, &amp;c, entitled them to a settlement of the Tangier question quite other than that which they had previously been ready to accept. Moreover, they had naturally taken advantage of the situation created by the war to entrench themselves at Tan gier, where, holding as they did all the strings in their hands, they had already acquired a preponderating influence and were rapidly obtaining complete control. It was not surprising, therefore, that, when the&apos; resumption of the pre-war negotiations was broached, the French Government were found to be not merely definitely unwilling to accept the statute drafted in 1914, but anxious to reject the principle of internationalisation altogether. Delay was all in their favour, since 2012   [504 -]
every month enabled them further to consolidate their position. Most of the public services were already in their hands, and they were able to exercise a general control by the fact that the expenses of the administration were defrayed mainly by the protectorate Government.This was the situation a situation fraught with greater danger than is generally understood with which His Majesty&apos;s Government have been confronted since 1919 and which has been the cause of unremitting anxiety to them. They can justly claim that it is due to their determination to attain their object in spite of this altered situation, no less than to their forbearance in the face of the breakdown at the very outset of each of a series of attempts made since the beginning of 1919 to find a reasonable basis for the resumption of negotiations, that agreement has now been reached. The convention signed the other day in Paris, by bringing this long-standing and delicate question to a solution, removes a fertile source of international mistrust; at the same time it not only secures the two vital British desiderata, viz., the permanent neutralisation of Tangier and the maintenance of the open door, but establishes an international regime which will effectively prevent the predominance of any single Power.As is now known, the future administration of Tangier will be entrusted to an international assembly composed of representatives of all the Powers who, by virtue of their signature of the Act of Algeciras, have a special interest in Morocco, as well as of a number of native and Jewish members, the composition of this body being such that no one Power will be in the position to exercise a predominant influence. An&apos; additional safeguard is provided by a Committee of Control, composed of the consular officers of the signatories of the Act of Algeciras, whose function it will be to see that the provisions of the statute are faithfully carried out, and who will possess the right of veto. The administrative posts will be in the hands of officers of different nationalities.The port concession^ granted in 1921 by the Sultan to an international company, has been revisedjn the direction of a more equitable distribution of the share capital and of increased British representation on the board. His Majesty&apos;s Government had consistently refused to recognise the validity of the 1921 concession in the form in which it was then issued, especially in the light of the failure to reach agreement in regard to the status of Tangier. The amendment of the concession will enable work to be commenced on the port to which Tangier looks so largely for its future welfare.Though generally well-received in this country, the Tangier Convention, like everything else of importance, has come in for its share of opprobrium in certain quarters. Such criticism, however, has been singularly undefined, and has consisted mainly of complaints, in vague and general terms, that the French have granted internationalisation in form, but not in substance. The fact that the first administrator is to be a Frenchman is cited in support of this contention. The existing position of the French in Tangier, however, gave them a claim to this appointment which could,not be resisted. The appointment is only for six years, after which the Assembly is free to make its own nomination. Moreover, any ^administrator, of whatever nationality he may be at the moment, can be removed by a three-quarter majority vote of the Committee of Control. It was surely of capital importance that during the transition period the administrator should be in a position, where necessary, to co-operate closely with the French protectorate authorities, and that he should also have a thorough knowledge of Morocco and the Moors.  A Frenchman best fulfils these requirements.A somewhat more defined criticism is that which has been levelled against the administration of the natives by the Sultan, through a representative styled the Mendoub. The answer to this is: (a) that the French Government made this point an absolute sine qua non of their concessions in other directions, or indeed of their continuance of the negotiations, (b) that the authority of the Mendoub is not unlimited, as seems generally supposed. The natives are subject, like everyone else, to the laws passed by the Assembly, which the Mendoub must enforce. The French also not unnaturally attach importance to uniformity of treatment of the natives in the Tangier zone and in the French zone in which they are administered by Moorish officers appointed by the Sultan. The administration of Moors is a task requiring skill and experience.. The French feared that if it were, entrusted to an international body, friction would become rife between natives and Europeans. This would have an unfortunate repercussion in the French zone where the prestige of the protecting Power would suffer.
Generally speaking, these criticisms proceed from a misconception of the position, based, as they appear to be, on the assumption that the players, on opening the game, held hands of more or less equal value. In point of fact, the trumps were nearly all held by France. The result, as in all cases where interests are conflicting, was necessarily a compromise. As such, and in the light of the, fact that the aims of the contracting parties were so divergent as to have caused agree-ment to be despaired of altogether in recent years, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that they have good reason to be satisfied. The settlement has been welcomed by British commercial interests who, during the progress of the negotiations, exhibited the utmost nervousness lest they might find that their cause&apos; had been sacrificed to political considerations of a general character.Foreign Office, January 10, 1924,P.S.-The War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry, whose views on the question had been known to us for some time, were again consulted before the conference met and also during its session. The Board of Trade were also consulted in regard to the financial and commercial clauses.
