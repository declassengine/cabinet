THE DISPUTE IN THE COAL MINING INDUSTRY.Memorandum by Secretary for Mines.        a  oThe Miners1 Federation have given notice to terminate the present national wages agreement.   The notice expires on the 17th April, but the Federation has announced that this is not to be taken as terminating individual contracts, and it is unlikely that a national strike will take place without a further ballot.The principles of the Agreement are that in every district the &quot;net proceeds&quot; available for wages and profits in the district as a whole are periodically ascertained, and wages are fixed at such a level as will absorb roughly 85$ of them. But wages are never to fall below a certain minimum level in each district, however low the &quot;net proceeds&quot; may be.The object of the Federation in giving notice was not to abrogate the principles of the agreement but to amend its details.   Their chief demands were:-(a) that the minimum level of wages should be raised. At present it is 20$ above &quot;standard&quot;,, . This represents, on average, 42$ on pre war earnings.   They ask that 20$ shall he raised to 40$.(b) that their share of &quot;net proceeds&quot; shall be raised from about 85$ to about 88$.xProspect of negotiations. -&quot;The owners are willing to negotiate on both these points.   Serious discussion   of them began on Thursday and is being continued daily (except Monday) until Wednesday evening, if an agreement has not been arrived at earlier.On Thursday;, the Miners&apos; Federation will report to a delegate conference.   If an agreement has been reached and the conference confirms it, there is an end of the matter. If no agreement has been arrived at, or if the conference
ft ;iS &quot;\refuses to confirm a provisional agreement reached by the Executive, it is probable that the decision will be to negotiate no further with the owners but to ask Parliament to regulate wages in the industry by passing the Miners&apos; Minimum Wage Bill that is to come up for second reading on the 21st March on the motion of Mr. Guest. Minimum Wage Bill.Into the merits of this Bill it is unnecessary to enter.    Indeed, it is being redrafted and its exact terms are unknown.   But I understand from Mr. Smith, that it will, in effect, provide that the minimum level of wages, instead of being 20$ above standard as at present, or 4o/a as the men are now asking the owners, should be a percentage above standard corresponding to the cost of living figure (at present 7*9)I do not think that an attempt to solve the diffioulty in this way can lead to anything but disaster.   Even If the Bill passed its seoond reading, it would be quite impossible to get a measure of this magnitude through all its stages in less than two months, and at every stage defeat would be possible.   During all this time, even if a stoppage did not take place,     and -Mr. Smith predicts a national stoppage if it is rejected - the industry would be in a ferment) and in the end the House of Lords would certainly refuse the Bill a seoond reading, and the Government would have a quarrel with the House of Lords added to its other troubles, with a solution of the difficulties of the industry no nearer, and indeed more remote.Policy of the Government. /The Government cannot in the last resort prevent a strike, but they can at any rate see that before a strike takes place the matters at issue are critically and impartially examined and reported upon by some independent authority.    I suggest that, failing a sucoossful issue to the negotiations, a
Court of Inquiry of three persons unconnected with the coal mining industry ought sooner or latter to be set up.   Their terms of reference should not, of course, Include Questions of the organisation of the Industry but should be confined to the . points at issue.   Within those limits, however, they should have the widest power of investigating the working of the agreement and they should be asked to record their own con-elusions; though naturally these would not be legally binding on either side.   I have reason to believe that the coal owners are not likely to make strong objection to the setting up of such an enquiry.   A section of the miners, though probably not the majority, may be expected to oppose it strongly.   But the general public will be unanimous in Its approval; indeed if there is delay in instituting such an enquiry pressure of public opinion may become irresistible.If a Court of Inquiry has been set up, the issues raised by the Minimum wage Bill will be part of the issues which will then stand referred to the Court, whose terms of reference can be so drawn as to include them.Such a Court would require to be set up by the Minister of Labour under the Industrial Courts Act, and he will no doubt give his views both on the situation generally and on the question whether there Is any legal or other difficulty in the course proposed.If this policy is to have any chance of success, the time at which the decision is to be announced is all-Important., &quot;he must not act so soon that it can be said that we have ruined a reasonable chance of settlement by agreement.   We must not delay action so long that we appear to be yielding to. public, pressure,    ice ought if possible to avoid acting at a time when It Is likely that the miners may refuse to have anything to do with the Court beoause they think than another and better alternative is open to them.-   The problem how best to meet all
So these considerations can only he solved by the progress of events,Subject, tnerefore, to anything that Mr. Shaw may have to say, I suggest that the Cabinet should give discretionary authority to him to set up such a Court if and when he and I agree, or, in the event of a difference of opinion between us, the Prime Minister decides, that the time has come.E. SRIHWELL. 8th March, 1924.
