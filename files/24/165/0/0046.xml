-THIS DOCUMENT- IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITA3B1I0 MAJESTY&apos; S iCrOTSMMSST, ^SECRET,CABINET,Copy Ho0CP.144(24).HOME   AFFAIRS   COMMITTEE,Local Authorities (Emergoncy Provisions) Bill.,Memorandum by tho Minister of Health.In accordance with the recommendations of the Committee of Homo Affairs (H,A^C,lst Conclusions (24) 1) tho Cabinet on tho 13th of February agreed to give their general approval to the introduction of certain bill, Including the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Bill, subject to the usual examination of the Bills in detail by the Home Affairs Committees&quot;X-A draft of this Bill has already been circulated., and I propose that it should be introduced in the form of tho draft0Trie Bill provides for the extension for a further two years of -1* the operation of Section 1 of tho Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Act-1923,, whereby the cost of indoor relief in tho metropolis is charged on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund at tho rate of l/3d0per head per day, and the cost of outdoor relief is charged on the Fnnd at a maximum rate of 9d, per head por day0 2* Tho operation of Section 2 of the Emergency Previsions Act Of 1923, which enables local authorities to borrow for the purpose of providing temporary for their current ox-penses, and otherwise extends thoir borrowing powers during tho contilnuanco of abnormal employments The proposed extension of the borrowing powers^cf&apos; local authorities is necessary and uaoontroversial, bub there -will be come, although.. I thinks, not very substantial, opposition in respect of the proposed extension of the charges upon the Metropolitan Common Poor Funda
I recently received, a deputation from the Metropolitan Borough Councils and boards of Guardians who contribute to the Fund.   The deputation suggested to me -(a) That the extension now contemplated should be for one and not for two years, and(b.) That the rate   of charge on the Fund should be reduced from 9d.to 7d.,or alternatively, that the charge on the Fund in respect of outdoor relief should be limited to the insurable unemployed.On the first point I am inclined to take the view that the Bill, as introduced, should provide for an extension of the period for two years, and that this might be justified on the grounds of avoiding further legislation next year. But it may be urged that, in view of the undertaking given by the Government to deal with . the whole question of the London Poor Law, an extension for one year should suffice, and if this point is pressed I should be prepared to reduce the period to one year.With regard to tho second point, no substantial reasons wore advanced&apos;by the deputation&apos;in support of the suggested reduction from 9d.to 7d. and, in my view, the position is so far substantially the same as it was in 19 that there     is no case for the alteration   of the rate of charge.   The average cost per day per person relieved in the various Unions In London was, in the half-year ended September, 1922, 10.43d. and in the half-year ended September 1923, 10.22d.(Intd) J.W.IJtoy of Health, ith February, 1924.
