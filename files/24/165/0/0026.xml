this document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,Memorandum &quot;by the Presidenttof the Board of Education onthe observations of the Secretary for Scotland (C.P,116(24)).The cnly immediate difference between myself and the Secretary for Scotland as indicated in his observations in CP, 116(24) is&apos;as to the period for which the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act 1922 should be extended.   Inasmuch as it expires on the 1st day of June 1924 it is common ground that it should be extended for some period.My proposal is that it should be extended to 31st July 1926 with power to bring it to an end at an earlier date.   It is quite clear therefore that if the Scottish Office secure the adoption of their view and the scheme of the Emmott Report is carried into effect by legislation this year or next, the Bill which the Board of Education propose will present no obstacle to the earlier wind-ing up of the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act 1922.The Secretary for Scotland on the other hand argues that the Act should expire on the 31st July 1925.   This makes it essential to legislate before that date.   It is coupled with the recommenda-tion that the legislation should take the form suggested by the Emmott Report.   Even if the Board of Education and the Scottish Office were fully satisfied that the best way of dealing with the matter was that contained in the Emmott Report it is quite certain that as far as England and Wales are concerned the adoption of that Rep:rt would be extremely contentious and that the considera-tion of any Bill giving effect to it would absorb a large amount of Parliamentary time.The Government programme both in 1924 and 1925 is * likely to be very crowded and crowded with matters of the first importance far exceeding in magnitude!j5C3BT.CABINET.SCHOOL TEACHERS SUPiilRAlllIUATION BILL, 1924.CP. 126(24).
this question of the principles on which school teachers should he superannuated.     It would he most unwise to pledge the Government to take up a controversial piece of legislation of this character either this Session or next.     There is a serious risk that it would he impossible to pass the legisla-tion next Session and that the Sohool Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1922, would consequently lapse,It should also he remembered that the date suggested, 31st July 1925, is a date which, as has already been pointed out, will not he agreeable to teachers in England and Wales and the effect of adopting that date might wall-he not only to make the permanent legislation contentious hut also to make this temporary Act contentious with the result that we should have two contentious Bills dealing with teachers superannua-tion in two succeeding Sessions.We have therefore a choice between the Beard of Education&apos;s proposal which is consistent with everything that the Scottish Office desire, and the Scottish Office proposal which is likely to cause   serious difficulty in England and is inconsistent with the Board of Education views.   It is suggested that in these circumstances the Board of Education proposal might he adopted.The remainder of the memorandum deals mainly with points of controversy which can he more conveniently con-sidered on a future occasions     The Board of Education cannot agree that the-only further discussion of the Emmott Committee which is needed is Parliamentary discussion.     This is certainly not the view of the English and Welsh teachers who do vary definitely desire the opportunity of detailed dis-cussion of the provisions of a permanent measure.
The Board hare great doubts whether it would he possible to carry a Measure through Parliament, which includes provision for a contribution by Local Education Authorities.   It is an essential element in the Emmott Committee&apos;s plans that Local Education Authorities should make a real contribution out of the rates to teachers&apos; pensions, and to increase grants to Local Education Authorities to cover their contributions would be quite inconsistent with the principles of the Report. It is clearly necessary that these objections should be con-sidered by the Government before the Government commit thera-selves to the adoption of the Report and the time to determine when the Government&apos;s intentions in the matter shall be announced can be most conveniently considered when the Government&apos;s intentions are settled.With regard to paragraph 1 of the Memorandum, nothing turns on this point.   Such disagreement as there is, is merely on questions of terminology.On paragraph 3 the Memorandum of 8th February 1924 dealt with the matter solely from the point of view of England and Wales, and when it referred to Associations of Teachers, it referred tc the English and Welsh Associations.   The consider-ations urged by the Educational Institute of Scotland are no doubt important, but from the Parliamentary point of view the entirely different views entertained by the Associations of England are likely to carry more weight.With regard to the financial advantage of proposing a permanent Measure, I cannot accept the view that relief to the Exchequer is likely to be more wanted at some future time than in the next two years.
