IUJHaiELOIMaHT COkMITIBHj^-JUVEHILE TO JMPLOYMEKT. &quot; &quot;REPORT   Off   SUB-COMMITTEE.ASB OF EMERY IflTQ UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.The fact that boys and girls between 14 and 16 are not insured against unemployment leads to certain serious dis-advantages.   They cannot draw unemployment benefit when unemployed,.   Only a small number of them are registered at the Employment  ^changes and there is, therefore^ an almost oompleto absence of reliable information as to tho extent to which they are in fact unemployed; for the same reason the Employment Exchanges (or tho local Education Authorities which do Choice of Employment work-) find it much more difficulties to keep in touch with boys and girls between 14 and 16 than with those between 16 and 18l   In areas where unemployment among juveniles is serious the best available means of dealing with it at present is by getting the.unemployed boys and girls to attend Juvenile Unemployment Centres.   Those botwaeii 1&apos;6 and 18 .are compelled to attend such Centres as a condition of receiving benefit,   but this does not apply bit those between 14 and 16, and in practice only a few- ef them attend voluntarily.   These are all strong reasons for reducing the age of entry into Unemployment Insurance t* 14.If the age nf entry into Unemployment Insurance were reduced to 14 it would be most desirable, and indeed almost essential, on administrative grounds for the rates ef contribution in respect of bo-y B and girls between 14 and 16
. n.J o *ito be tho same as those for boys and girls between 16 and 18, i.e. :-Employer v;      Employed StateBoys. 5d. 4^d. 3 7/83.Girls.        4-i-d. 4d. 3 5/8d.It is suggested that the weekly benefit for boys and girls between 14 and 16 should be - Boys 5s.   Girls 4s.I The corresponding rates for boys and girls betweon 16 and 18 ^re -Boys 7s.6d.   Girls Ss.   Having regard to the current ratoVef wages, these rates of benefit are thought to he too high for boys and girls between 14 and 15, and the suggested reduction in the rate of benefit for them, although they pay the same contributions as boys and girls betweon 16 and 18, could -further be justified on the ground that those between 14 and 16ihave only just come into insurance and have therefore necessarily paid very few contributions.Tho total amount in contributions likely to be collected and the amount of benefit paid in present circumstances are estimated to be as fellows Employers and employed. 1,240,000.Exchequer. 510,0001,750,000The amount of benefit that would be paid is uncertain as the rote of unemployment among these boys and girls is not accurately known, but at 5s. and 4s. a week it might probably amount to  275,000 annually.Administrative expenses would fall to be deducted and in addition it is contemplated that part of the revenue from the contributions of boys and girls between 14 and 16 and also from those between 16 and 18 should be applied to assist the maintenance of Juvenile Unemployment Centres.    It is suggested
r9 9 ^&apos; i&apos;; &apos; &apos;l, ; &quot;      -     :&quot;:that a grant of a certain amount per attendance should he made from the Unemployment Fund to the Local Education Authority (or other body running a Centre) in respect of a boy or girl required to attend the Centre as a oondttion of receiving &apos; benefits the above figures relate to proaent conditions when a specially heavy rate of contribution is being charged in order to meet the exceptional unemployment now prevailing,-&apos; In normal circumstances the rate of contributions would&quot;&apos;ho reduced and it is estimated that the net income, after allowing for expenses, would ba no more than about  800,000 a years whereas the benefit exponditaro is not likely to be substantially reduced.   Under the existing Unemployment Insurance Scheme any excess of income from contributions over expenditure on benefits is applied to the redemption of the debt on the Unemployment Fund, and any balance of contribu-tions obtained from juveniles should not escape this liability, which is shared by other classes of insured pesrsons where unemployment risk is low.In considering this proposal it is necessary to take account of possible reaction on the Health Insurance Scheme. If the ago of entry for Unemployment Insurance were roducod to. 14 there would almost certainly be a demand for a similar reduotion in the case of Health insurance, which would be difficult to resist as it would not be easy to defend an .&apos; arrangement under which benefit was payable while a boy was well but ceased on his falling ill.   One special difficul-ty in this case arises from the fact that under the Health Insurance Scheme there is no reduction in the ratos of *contribution or benefit for persons below tho ago of 18 as there is in Unemployment insurance.   Accordingly, if persons below 16 were brought into Health Insurance, they would
9 9 9&apos;:.)&apos; ij Veither have to pay the relatively high weekly contributions applying to adults, or a system (which would be entirely new for Health Insurance) of special rates of contribution, and presumably special rates of benefit, would have to bo introduced for those between 14 and 16c   Under either plan serious difficulties would bo created.   Under the former arrangement the insured person would be serioasly over-charged in relation to the current costs of hie benefits and the employer would be called upon to pay a high rate of contribution in relation to the wages which ho is paying. Moreover, the full rate of 15s. a week for sickness benefit would be unduly high after a boy had been on unemployment benefit of 7s.6cL and would lead to malingering.   Under the latter plan a differential rate of contribution would be introduced, which would cause trouble to employers and would increase the work of Approved Societies and of the Mini atry of Health.While it is probable that there would bo a demand from some quarters for tho lowering of the age 11 it for Health Insurance If that for Unemployment Insurance were lowered, any such proposal would be likely to meet with opposition from the older Friendly Socieites who at present look to their juvenile sections as the recruiting ground for boys and girls becoming State-insured members at age 16.Having regard to the probable reaction on Health Insurance the Committee do not ieel able to ma.; o a definite recommendation with regard to the proposal to reduce the age of entry for unemployment insurance *to 14.   Tho Committee accordingly consider that the point is one which the Cabinet must decide.
9 S t\The existing arrangements in this oonjiection are that a Government grant of 75$ of the oost is payable in approved cases during the period ending April 17th next.   The question of extending the period of this sanction has been taken up by the Minisfer of labour with the Treasury, and the Treasury have now agreed that the period of sanotion may be extended in approved cases up to March 31st, 1925*.Owing to the&apos; heavy pressure on the rates, and in particu-lar owing to the cuts which have been made in the Education Estimates, certain local Authorities (e-sg. Glasgow) in whoso area unemployment among boys and girls is heavy, have not seen their way to bear ovon 25$ of the oost for Juvenile Unemployment Centres; if; fact, the number of Authorities with centres now opon is only 33, with a total attendance of about 6,880,   For this reason consideration has for some time been given to tho question whether improved terms even beyond 75$ of the cost could pocsi bly bo given, and among the proposals that have been considered is that of paying 1C0$ of the costgThere aro obvious objections to paying 100$ of the cost, local Education Authorities would then have no financial incentive to keep the cost down and no really effective safe-guards against possible extravagance could bo imposed without tho risk of intolerable friction,   At the same time the total sum which  might perhaps be spent beyond the strict minimum, on account of a 100$ grant, is not likely to be large in this particular service and in present oircumstancos.    In the period following the armistice a 100$ grant was pai4 fof a time to local Education Authorities in respect of Juvonilo Unemployment Centres and no serious difficulty was then found to arise.
! *) p AOn % ho whole, after considering tho matter very carefully, and particularly for the reason that, from all the enquiries which have been made It seoms clear that the; payment of lOO^o is the only way in which the number of centres can be sub-stantially increased, the Committee recommend:-That such a grant of 100^ should be authorised as an emergency measure, for so long as unemployment among boys and girls remains on its present soale. On the clear understanding, however, that the grant will only be made in   -respect of approved expenditure   and that the charges to be made by Local Jldueation authorities must include only out-of-pocket expenses (e.g&apos;* must nost include rent of premises already occupied by them).PROVISION FOR UNEMPLOYED BOYS a HI) GIRLS MOT 007ER ,1 BY INSURANCE.If the age for Unemployment Insuranoe were reduoed 14 boys and girls between those ages who had done enough * ineurable work to qualify for benefit would receive benefit when unemployed and would be required to attend a centre where centres are available.   There would, however, be a number of cases of boys and girls who, although they had left school,    had either done no work at all or had done so little as not to qualify for benefit.    The problem of dealing with these boys and girls is extremely difficult. Proposals have been put forward for making a State grant of an equal amount to that which would have been paid in unemployment benefit if they were insured and payable on condition of their attending a centre.   This is a far-reaching proposal and before coming to any decision with regard to it the Committee think it desirable that tjae problem should be further explored.   They therefore prepese:-That the Ministry of Labour, in conjunction with the Board of Education and the Scottish Office, should be requested to arrange to make special enquiry in selected areas as to the extent to which in fact there is unemployment    -and possibly demoralisation among boys and girls between 14 and 16 who have left school and have done no work, and as to the best way of dealing with such demoralisation if it exists.-6-
9 f, iRAISING OE THE SCHOOL LiiiAVIMS AGE.The Education Act of 1918 affected the school leaving age directly, and irrespeotivo of the action of local education authorities, in two ways:-(a) By providing for the abolition of half time.(b) By providing that the obligation to attend schoolshould extend not until the fourteenth birthday but until the end of the term in which the age of fourteen is reached.These provisions are now universally in operation.There has always been a certain amount of voluntaryattendance at public elementary schools after the obligationto attend school has expired, and tho late President of theBoard of Education,in answer to questions in the House ofCommons, expressed his agreement with the view that wherethero is adequate   accommodation in the school it is most desirable that parents should be encouraged and even urged to allow their children to stay at sohool after the age offourteen until they obtain employment.   Something has beendone in particular areas to encourage a voluntary prolongation of the public elementary school life, but tho Committeeunderstand the Board of Education would deprecate on education-al grounds any general exhortation on the subject to thelocal education authorities which did not take note of certainpractical difficulties.The Act of 1918 also empowered local education authorities by bye-law to provide for co! pulsory attendance to an age not being less than 14 nor more than 15.   Bye-laws are subject to the approval of tho Board   f Education and no bye-law for this purpose is yet in operation, but the President of th*e Board     . undertook on tho 21st February to consider bye-laws for this purpose on their merits subject to any objections which might be elicited by their publication.   He indicated that the Board would have regard to certain considerations set
out in the extract appended to this Report.   There are        &quot;iJ certain technical points which must he home in mind.   A bye-law raising the school age to 15 cannot provide&apos;that all children shall be exempt on obtaining employment.   It may schedule occupations employment in which will automatically give exemption.   The only possible exemption is statutory and not dependent on the bye-law.   It oan only be granted after due enquiry as to&quot;the individual child.   The initiative in the matter of these bye-laws rests entirely with the looal , aucation authority,   for tho country as a whole limitations of suitable accommodations, apart from the attitude of very-many authorities towards new educational expenditure, preclude a general extension of the school age.   The Committee understand that if thore is a grave problem of unemployed leavei&apos;3 in particular areas the President might invite the local education authorities concerned to consider   the submission of bye-laws raising the school age to 15 with special arrangements for considering individual claims for exemption on such grounds as beneficial employment.    In the interest of the normal wor  of the schools special arrangements for teaching the leavers will be necessary and without exceptional financial assistance towards the special expenditure it is doubtful whether many authorities would respond to such an invitation,   The Committee are informed that, otherwise than by bye-la?;, the Board see no possibility of dealing with the problem of abnormal unemployment of lervors on educational lines, that they are doubtful as to tho educational success of such an experiment, and that it is uncertain whether the end desired, viz. to get the unemployed leavers under instruction, is likoly to be attained very rapidly in many areas whero &quot;the need may be greatest 5   In the opinion
of the Board tho. nature of the problem of the unemployed leavers is such that Special arrangements, e*g. by means of Juvenile Unemployment Centres organised apart from tho main educational system, would offer better prospects.   If the necessary financial provision for such measures were available they could probably be brought into effect with little delay.Initialled on bohalf of the Sub-Committee (Signed) R.B..HOW0RTH, M.GoB,Acting Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., 3rd March, 1924.J&quot;
APPENDIX. 9/13HOUSE OF COMMONS, QUESTION AND ANSWER 43. Thursday, 21st February, 1924.Mr. Hoffman, -   To ask the President of the Board of Education, whether he is willing to entertain proposals by Local Education Authorities to exercise their powers under Section 46 of the Education Act, 1921, to raise the age of obligatory attendance at Public1 Elementary Schools to 15 years.Mr. Graham White, -   To ask the President of the Board of Education, if he has received representations from Local Education Authorities urging that ihe school-leaving age be raised to I?;   and if he will state his attitude tc this matter.MR. CHARLES TREVELYAN:     With the permission of the Hon. Members I will deal with these two   Questions together.I am prepared to consider Byelaws for this purpose on their merits, subject of course to any objections which may be elicited by their publication, and in doing so I shall have regard to the considerations set oat in paragraphs 8 and 9 of Circular ll8o of the 12th October, 1920.Extracts from Circular ll8o.x x x x8.     Under this subsection a byelaw which raises the age of school attendance to 15* must be universal and apply to all children except in so far as :-(a) children employed in specified occupations are excluded by the byelaw itself from its operation;   or(b) exemption is granted to individual children on consideration of circumstances affecting those children.It is not permissible under this subsection to make a byelaw expressed as applying to all children and then to confine its enforcement to particular classes of children, e,g,   those who have been irregular in attendance up to the age of 14 or those wly have not attained a certain standard of proficiency.
It was the deliberate intention of the Education Act, 19l8, to abolish exemptions based solely on previous attendances 01 on proficiency, and the Board are not justified in countenancing any proposal to re-introduce exemptions based on these grounds alone,9o The Board are prepared to consider proposals for making a byelaw under the subsection raising the school leaving age to 1?, but it may be useful to mention the conditions which, in the Board&apos;s opinion, should be satisfied before any such byelaw is brought into operation.     These are as fcllows:-(a) There should be a sufficiency of school aoconanoda-tion and of teaching staff throughout the area to prrvide for the education of all the children between 14 and 15 who are subject to the byelaw.(b) Tho Authority, in accordance with section 2(l)(a)(ii) of the Education Act, 1918, should have organised in their public elementary schools adequate and suitable courses of advanced instruction for the older or more intelligent children,  including children who stop at school beyond, the age cf 14.x x. x x11 -
