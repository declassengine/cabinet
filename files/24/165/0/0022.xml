THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERJTJEHT.KCRET ,122(24)1 9CAB IS I T.POOR LAW RELIEF TO STRIKERS.MBMOIilNDUM BY THE MINISTER OF.JrlEALTH.Copy No.The Dock Strike,.if it continues for even a short period, is likely to lead to applications on a large scale for poor law relief for persons on strike, and as I shall in that erase certainly be asked to define my attitude on the question of such relief to persons on strike I desire to consult my colleagues with regard to the policy to be pursued.     The Cabinet will remember that this question became acute during the Coal Trade dispute in 1920 and more recently In the Dock Strike of last year, and that the con-tinuance of the Dock Strike In London was attributed in the public press to the action of Poplar and some other Boards of Guardians in giving relief to strikers.The legal position is by no means unambiguous, and the practical application of the law as defined in regard to this question Is full of difficulties.&apos; The governing decision&apos; is that given by the Court of Appeal in 1900 in the case of The Attorney General v. The Merthyr Tydfil Union (69 L.J. Ch.299 (1900); 1 Ch,516, &amp;c).      The Judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case was to the following effect:-1.   Poor Relief could not be legally given to able-bodied men who were physically fit to work and able to obtain work at wages sufficient to support themselves and their families, but who refused to perform such work; but if the men became so reduced by want as to be unable to work, they might be relieved, subject to the liability to prosecution&apos;under the Vagrancy Act, 1824, for neglecting to maintain themselves. The actual words used by the Master of&quot;the Rolls in his Judgment may be quoted -&quot;The inability to maintain himself which justifies an &quot;able-bodied man in requiring, relief from the poor law&apos; &apos;   -1-       . &apos; &apos; - MM
&quot;authorities must ........ be a real actual inability i9-QI. ZJ u&quot;to support himself on any terms with which he can in &quot;fact comply, and which, as between him and the ratepayers, &quot;do not justify him in refusing to support himself.   He &quot;cannot ......... lawfully justify such a refusal on the&quot;ground that he cannot obtain work on terms which, as &quot;between him and his employer, he considers reasonable. &quot;What is a reasonable agreement for a man to enter into &quot;is one thing;   what is a reasonable justification for a &quot;ban compelling others to support him is quite another &quot;thing:   but it is the latter alone which the poor law &quot;authorities ought to consider.&quot; 2.   A strike did not create a case of urgent necessity for relief within the meaning of section 54 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, or give to the men collectively any right to relief which they would not have individually, .3.   Relief might be given to the wives and children of men who refused to work, and also to other men who were thrown out of work in consequence of their refusal, if such persons were destitute, but, in the case of the wives and children of the strikers, the strikers would be liable to be dealt with under the Vagrancy Act for neglect of family. 4.   The Local Government Board (now the Minister of Health) had no power to extend the application of the Poor Law Statutes to persons not entitled to relief under them. 5.   The High Court had jurisdiction, to make a declaration toprevent an illegal application of the rates by the Guardians, but it could not control the power of the Local Government Board, (now the Minister of Health) to remit the disallowance of unlawful payments under section 4 of the Poor Law Atiend-ment Act, 1848, The difficulties of applying this Judgment in practice have resulted in lack of uniformity in administration on the part of different Boards of Guardians, and have made it impossible for the Department to adopt a clear-cut policy. &apos;. -
The difficulties that have&apos;heen..fovai4&apos;&quot;&apos;to--Ariae-in the application of the judgment may be briefly summarised as follows:- 190J. o ii1, It is necessary for the Guardians to decide when application for relief is made to them by a person on strike whether work is in fact available to the applicant at a living wage, in other words the Guardians are placed in the position of having to decide on the merits of the dispute.   Thus relief or no relief becomes a political question, and different Boards of Guardians may take different views according to their political attitude, and in consequence adopt different policies as regards the relief of applicants concerned in a trade dispute This in fact happened in the coal trade dispute in 1920.Further, the difficulties of deciding whether work is really available to an individual man on strike are increased when the opposition of his fellows - possibly a physical opposition - is taken into account,21    The admission In the Judgment that a striker maybe relieved in person (apart from the question of his family) if he becomes so reduced by want as to be unable to work makes it possible for a board of guardians within the bounds of legality to relieve strikers with little more restriction than applicants who are not strikers, as the need of any applicant for relief Is a question of faot the determination of which rests with the guardians.3i    The power to prosecute the relieved striker under the Vagrancy Act, 1824, Is practically Ineffective.     Not only is it very cumbersome, as a separate prosecution against each Individu striker would be necessary, but here again the Guardians as prosecutors would be a priori in the question of having taken sides in regard to the merits of the dispute.4,    The doctrine that the striker&apos;s family can be relieved without the striker is difficult to apply in practice and, further, violates the important principle that poor law relief to a dependant is constructively relief to the head of the
household.     Further the striker can, of course, appropriate part of the relief supplied for his family, and a Board of   J  ft Guardians desiring to evade the judgment can provide for the striker by increasing the amount of relief to his family.In view of these difficulties the administrative action open to my Department has been practically confined to calling the attention of Boards of Guardians to the terms of the judgment, and leaving it to the District Auditor to deal with any illegalities which he may discover in their application -or non-application - by particular Boards of Guardians,    Apart, however, from the fact that the Auditor, in common with the Guardians and the Department, labours under the difficulties inherent in the application of the Judgment, the question does not usually come before the auditor until some considerable time after the relief has been paid and the strike is over.   The expedient of ordering an extraordinary audit might be adopted in the case of a localised dispute, but it would be hardly practicable to have a series of such audits in a case of such magnitude as the present.   Further it is seldom, If ever, practi-cabls in cases of the kind, even though there has been a clear violation of the la*r, to surcharge the whole cost of the relief illegally given on the Guardians conoerned,The difficulties of the position of course arise fundamentally from the conflict between the contention that a strike should not be supported out of rate funds and the statutory duty of the Guardians as responsible for the relief of destitution to prevent a striker from starving.   And there can, of course, be no question of allowing persons on strike to starve,I am advised that it Is Improbable that the High Court would overthrow the Merthyr Tydfll judgment if the question of relief to persons on strike came before them again, e,g. in connection with an application for an injunction by a ratepayer or ratepayers to restrain a Board of Guardians from giving such relief
Eut it is just possible that the Court&quot;might give a clearer interpretation than the Merthyr Tydfil judgment. I under-stand that some of the Poplar ratepayers are in fact 4 f jcontemplating an application to the Court in connection with the last Dock Strike,But the immediate problem is to decide on the policy which is to he adopted under the existing law,Cn the one hand it is possible to maintain the existing practice, unsatisfactory as it is, of drawing the attention.of Boards of Guardians to the terms of the Merthyr Tydfil Judgment, and leaving matters to the auditor to deal with afterwards at his. audit of the Guardians&apos; accounts, Any disallowance and surcharge made by the auditor would subsequently come up for my review, when I should have to decide what action to take with regard to them.This course would be in accord with the answer given by the Prime Minister to Mr. Kemer&apos;s question In the House of Commons on the 12th February*     It would also have the advantage of temporarily shelving the necessity for a decision. But it would be likely to lead to criticism on the ground that it left Boards of Guardians and the public in a state of uncertainty both as to the legal position and to the policy of the Government,As an alternative, I am advised that it would be open to me to issue an Order under my existing powers requiring that all relief to p.-reons directly affected by an industrial dispute should be given in kind,     This would provide a clear-cut line which could be followed alike by the Guardians, the Central Department, and the auditors,     It is true that it would still rest with the Guardians to discriminate between those persons who could, under the Merthyr Tydfil judgment, legally be relieved and those who could not,&apos; but the line of discrimination would tend to become very narrow inasmuch as
relief in kin&apos;&amp; would be given to meet purely the physical necessities of the applicants, and, moreover relief given in this form could not be regarded as1 an inducement to persons on strike to remain out of work(Intd,) J.W.Ministry of Health.February 19th, 1924,
