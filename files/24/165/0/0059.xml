(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT.)1 fl o13SECRET.&quot;- CABINET.17(24) WIRELESS SERVICES.(Memorandum by the Postmaster General.)Imperial - Serylogo,10 Assuming the system of State ownership recommended 1137(24)      in the Wireless Report   is accepted in principle, there remains the question whether Canada should, like the other Dominions, be served by the Government stations In this oountry or whether the alternative suggestion of granting a lloenoe to the Marconi Company for the Canadian servicealone should be adopted.2, The principal reason for excepting Canada from the general scheme of the Report ia that the Marconi Company have conducted a Canadian service for the last 15 years and therefore deserve special consideration.On the other hand, the following points are worthy of notices-(a) The exception of one of the most important Dominions from the general principle necessarily impairs that principle,(b) The British Government own two Transatlantic oablee which are at present worked from the Central Telegram office.     If the wireless service with Canada isIn Government hands, it would be similarly worked from the Central Telegraph Office in close proximity to the cables;    the two means of communication * could therefore be used Interchangeably, traffio being diverted from one to the other In the case of exceptional pressure or Interruption,     A Government wireless service would be of considerable value as a stand
stand by in the event of one or other of the cables being broken, (o) In so far as the Marconi wireless servioe woulddivert traffic from the Government cables there would be a transfer of revenue from the Exchequer to the Company,3, The Marconi servioe to Canada is at present carried on under a provisional liO&apos;--noe terminable unconditionally at any time.   If the provisional licence were continued, the servioe oould be transferred to the Government without compensation if and when they were ready to undertake it.   If, on the other hand? a licence for a period of years were-granted it would have to Include a provision for compensation, in the event of the Government before the expiration of the licence desiring to transfer the service to its own hands,     The Marconi Company will probably represent that they desire to build a new station and are unable to do so unless they have security of tenure.   It appears to me that if the Government adopt the policy of State ownership as a general principle, the considerations above enumerated require careful consideration,&apos; Foreign Services04, The Committee!s recommendations appear to mean that as regards foreign services there slxmld be free competition between the Government and any Company or Companies which, may desire to enter the field, subject;, in the case of the Continental services, to a payment of royalty as compensation to the Government for the traffic diverted from the Government route.$. As regards the Extra-European services, Including the United States, I agree with the Report,   As regards theContinental -
Continental servioes, there are oertain countries, such as Spain, Sweden, Denmark, some of the Balkan States and parts! of Russia, whioh are not normally served by Government cables and in whioh from the telegraphic point of view the Government have little interest.   I soo no objection to these States being served by Maroonl wireless serviceo, and I see * no advantage in the Government attempting to start competition with them. . But the traffic to most of the remaining oountries, including Prance, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and the Central European States goes via Government cables, and In some cases via existing Government wireless servioes0     The existing means of communication are ample and as far aa oan be seen will be sufficient for the traffic for many years to come.   The Post Office gross revenue accruing from the Continental telegraph traffic is about  780,000 per annum on an expenditure of  650,000 giving a profit of about  130,000,     If the Maroonl Company are given a general licence to extend their servioes to other European countries, the Post Office revenue will suffer (without a corresponding reduction of expenditure) to the extent to whioh the Company are able to attraot traffic from the Government route,6. The polioy of competition recommended by the Committee appears to me open to financial criticism,,   Aa I have said, the existing means of communication are more than sufficient to provide for the available traffic and competitive services will almost certainly cut each other&apos;s throats and be run at a.loss.     If it is desired that further soope be given to the Marconi Company, in addition to the apecifio countries in which the British Government have no direct telegraphic interest, I suggest that an attempt be made to divide the remaining servioes between the Government and the Company on a system of territorial allocation, the Committee&apos;0 stipulation as to the payment of a royalty for the Company&apos;s licences being observed.
7.- The question of wireless telephony Is not opeoifically doalt with In the Committee&apos;s Report, and I recommend that it he maintained In the hands of the Government.    IJo oaranusroial services are at present in existenoe* but a Post Offioe Committee under the Chairmanship of Admiral Sir Henry Jaokson has been investigating the possibilities of commer-olal wireless telephony across the Atlantic with promising results.    It appears to me of importance that when commercial services beoome practicable they should be under the 3ame control in this country as the inland telephonic system, through which the conversations will have to be conducted, and I suggest that it be made olear that the Government&apos;s decision on the Wireless Report is confined to telegraphic comraunications and that wireless telephony will be retained in the hands of the&apos;State.0. I therefore recommend that the Wireless Committee&apos;s Report be adopted, subject to the following points:-(a) That the allocation of the Canadian servioe be reviewed in the light of the above mentioned considerations. (b) That as regards the Continental services. In plaoe of a system of unrestricted competition, an attempt be made to allocate the services geographically between the Marconi Company and the Government station, (o) That it be made clear in any announcement of polioy that the Government propose to retain commercial wireless telephone services in th^ir own hands.V.
