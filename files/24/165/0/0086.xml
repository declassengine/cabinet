ZOiTAL EBAX2H HTSURAKCE.. ^ &quot;------- &apos;  *   -  13..ja!KORAEDlJK BY THS MINISTER- 0* HEALTH.    COPY.No.__-.182(24) ./&apos;...,:,I must draw the attention of ray colleagues to theposition regarding the contracts with the doctors under thenational Health Insurance -scheme.     These contracts are made between the individual practitioner and the- Insurance Committee,on terms negotiated centrally between the Minister of Health andthe Insurance Acts Committee of the British Medical Association.The- last contracts terminated on the 31st of December, 1923, the doctors agreeing, in the course of&apos;the negotiations with the lateMinister of Health&apos;about the terms&apos; of service, to continueservice after the 1st of January, 1924, on the understanding that legislation Would be introduced making financial provision, asfrom that date, for whatever capitation fee was found to be payable by the.court of enquiry set up by.the late Government.Provision must be made to pay the doctors at the end of thismonth for the quarter 1st January - 31b.t-March.     In the absenceof fresh, legislation, I have legal power to pay for the quarteronly -at the rate of 7/- per head per annum, whereas the courtof enquiry found in favour of 9/- per head per -annum.     The lateMinister of Health anticipated that before the end of this monthit would be.possible to complete negotiations with the approved societies as to finding the necessary funds and, at all events,to obtain second reading of -a Bill to enable payment to be madeto- the. doctors -o-n the basis -of the finding, of the court ofenquiry;   parliament having thus approved of the&apos; principle of theBill, the necssBary disbursements on that.basis, although strictlyillegal, might reasonably have been made.     Owing to the GeneralElection and change of Government, negotiations&apos;: with the approved societies as to providing funds to carry out the finding of thecourt of enquiry have been unavoidably delayed. - In my forecast of Ministry of Health legislation necessary this Session,  Iincluded a Bill on this subject as a matter of extreme urgency,
but the Bill- oouid not he drawn pending a BGtxlsiaant with the approved eo-cietieiSi,     The Approved Societies Consultative Council have today&apos;aareed that all  the additional money required shall be found from societies&apos; funds without !a Treasury grant othai&apos;&quot; than :t3l9 statutory two-ninths.   The interval between now and the end of March is, however, so short that it will bo difficult to find time for the necessary legislation.     bhloss, however, time is found, 1 shall have -either (1) to&apos; repudiate the understanding on which the doctors have been serving since 1st. January and pay them at the end of March -on the bras is of 7/&apos;.-per annum, adjusting matters later when the legislation is through, or (2) to take the responeibil-lty of providing money for payment on the basis of. 9-/--per annum without legal authority.. If this were, a case of spending Exchequer money in advance of Parliamentary authority, Cabinet authority might bo invoked to cover, my responsibility.     It is, however, in fact a:case of spending money which is the property of approved societies, either individually or collectively, and which I. hold-in a fiduciary capacity,  on conditions laid down for me by Acts of Parliament.     Personal responsibility would apparently; attach to me if I made payment on the 9/- basis, and&apos;&quot; if - for any-reason Parliament did not pass a covering Bill.   It would,  in any case, be necessary -f or-me&apos; to override, the Accounting Officer of the Ministry, who would be in duty bound to challenge the payment as an illegal one.-I have caused the doctors to be sounded afr to whether in the circumstances they cannot assist me -by accepting payment at the end of March of one fourth of the 7/- per head which I have legal power to pay, with a promise that the, matter Wil-l- be adjusted as soon as ever the new Bill &quot;can be got through.    Taey argue that the situation is none-bf &apos; their making and &quot; hat the Government, should- not brg-ak public fa-ith pledged by its predecessor-.     They say that such action would have most deplorable results on the profession and that they would not
obtain acquiescence without great public clamour, and at the price of receiving interest on the payments in arrear.   For such payment of interest I have no available funds and I would find it extremely difficult to induce the approved societies to provide funds. ,In the circumstances, I am driven to the conclusion that I cannot escape taking a most undesirable responsibility, but I wish to place the matter fully before my colleagues and to be assisted.by&apos; their views on it.     And in any event I must press In the strongest manner, that--facilities be found for a Bill to go as far as possible before -the end of March --certainly to second reacting.     The Bill will be a short Bill with a strictly limited title-,and. it should..- be,non-controversial since the Approved Societies Consultative Council have agreed to the financial proposals embodied in it and,ho call is made on the Exchequer beyond the ordinary statutory, tnp-ninths proportion.   I am given to understand that steps- are being taken to inform, all those members- of Parliament who gave pledges to approved societies on this subject, that the bill to be introduced by the Government Is satisfactory to societies..The bill is in draft and will be ready to be sub-mlt ted-to the Home Affairs, Cornmittee- on-Friday the 21st Instant., I have informed, the Approved Societies&apos; Consultative Council that in my judgment, we are greatly indebted to them for assisting us to meet a very, serious difficulty and I trust my colleagues will agree with me in this view and will-help me by concurring that facilities should be given for the bill to be introduced and, at all events,, to obtain second reading before the end of March,(Intd.)
