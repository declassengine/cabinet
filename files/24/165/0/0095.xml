(r. This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1924. 585SECEET.18CP. 191 (24). CABINET.SPECIAL KEPORT ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 102.   Period ended February 25, 1924.THE period covered by the last report ended during the railway dispute in January and the employment position at that time reflected the dislocation of trade which was caused by that dispute at its worst. It will be seen from the tabular statement in Part I of the present report that a rapid recovery was made and that the steady improvement which had been manifest for some months has -been maintained. During the four weeks under review unemployment decreased by 73,697, 131,977, 161,209 and 165,661 respectively as compared with the figures for the 28th January. On the 25th February there were 95,726 fewer unemployed than during the week preceding the railway dispute, so that the ground lost has not only been regained but a further advance has been made.A feature of the period under review was the dockers&apos; strike, which lasted from the 16th to the 25th February. This caused a complete stoppage at all principal ports, but its effect upon other industries was less serious than might have been expected. In the- docks themselves the employment position shows a complete recovery from this temporary dislocation.I am including in this report a brief summary of the measures authorised by the present Government for the provision of further Unemployment Benefit, work and training for persons unemployed (Part III).T.

The employment position throughout the industry remains good generally, and continued improvement is reported from nearly all the fields. Apart from temporary stoppages here and there due to local wages disputes or repairs to winding gear, all pits seem to be well occupied and unemployment is practically confined to unskilled workers, and, amongst skilled workers, to such as are of advanced age. The industry recovered rapidly from the serious dislocation reported last month due to the railway dispute. The subsequent dockers&apos; dispute caused further dislocation at some pits in South Wales, but the effects of this are passing away. A shortage of railway wagons is reported to have caused inconvenience at collieries in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Ehondda Valley and Aberdare. Another cause of embarrassment is the housing shortage in the neighbourhood of certain collieries and in some instances it has been inadvisable for the Employment Exchanges to circulate in other districts vacancies for coal miners notified to them on account of the fact that no lodging facilities or housing accommodation existed in the localities of the work.Stone Quarries. The Portland and other stone quarries in the South-Western Counties are busy and likely to remain so in view of the extensive road construction [11389] b 2
and repairing operations in prospect. The strike referred to in the last report at the Portland quarries was settled and the men concerned resumed work or, tho 4th February. eChina Clay-Employment continues fairly good and improvement is reported Increased exports to America have been recorded and there is some prospect of new extensive works being established near Bodmin.Iron Mines.-At the Cumberland iron-ore mines, employment continues to be bad. Of a total of thirty such mines in the Cleator Moor district, which were working in 1909, no less than sixteen have definitely closed down; eight have closed since the depression, which commenced in October&apos; 1920, affecting about 1,000 men and, with one exception, there is no prospect of these mines reopening Many iron-ore miners have migrated to the United States and some have found employment in adjacent coal mines. Increased unemployment in this industry is reported from Middlesbrough and there is little hope of improvement.Tin Mines. There is no change to report in the Cornish Tin Mines, where there is still heavy unemployment among the surface workers and mine labourers.IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION.The employment position in the pig-iron industry and the-iron and steel trade generally is still slack and uncertain. In the North East Coast area there was no substantial improvement during the month. The settlement of the railway dispute quickly resulted in the reopening of numerous blast furnaces which had been damped down in consequence of the stoppage of supplies of coke, but all the furnaces stopped for that reason have not yet been put in blast. The Cleveland Iron Market is reported dull and stocks are accumulating. Continental competition in both the basic steel and pig iron markets is reported, but there is a much better demand for crucible steels and high grade steels generally. In the Midlands these industries are still slack, but appear to be recovering from the serious effects of the railway dispute and to be making a little headway on the whole, though the position varies very much in different districts. Trade is brisk at Chesterfield and in North Stafford-shire ; there has been improvement at Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent and Wellingborough; some advance has been made at Cradley Heath, Brierley Hill, Bilston and Dudley, but the position remains bad in these areas; at West Bromwich, Stourbridge and Kettering there has been increased short-time working or further discharges. In Wales the employment position is reported as satisfactory. Export facilities were restored with the cessation of the dockers&apos; strike and activity has been renewed. The prospects are not regarded as reassuring having regard to the importation of manufactured iron and steel goods and to the high price of coke which affects the price of home products. In Scotland, pronounced depression has occurred during the month. Belgian and German competition is being severely felt. At Coatbridge three additional furnaces have been shut down, leaving only four out of twelve now working. Further depression is reported at Parkhead, Motherwell, Airdrie, and Coatbridge, Men are being discharged in considerable numbers from tube works at Airdrie and Coatbridge.TIN-PLATE AND STEEL SHEET.Trade continues brisk and employment is very good. The demand for skilled men continues in the Llanelly and Swansea districts. Generally the demand has slowed down, but most works&apos;are booked up to the beginning of May.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Slow but steady improvement has continued during the month in these industries, but the employment position on the whole remains bad. On the North-East Coast conditions have improved to some extent during the period under review, but large numbers of shipyard workers remain on the live registers of the Exchanges. On the Mersey-side there is very little new construction work on hand but the yards seem to be fairly well employed on. repair work, reconditioning vessels ready for spring trade. At Barrow-in-Furness there has been considerable improvement, but there is nothing definitely in prospect to replace contracts now nearinj&apos; $unempToymenT during the month in these industries chiefly in consequence of completion.   On the Thames there&apos;is no improvement upon the position report last month and trade remains bad.  In South-Western ports there has been increased
stoppages due to a trade dispute at Southamption, where certain classes of workmen went on strike for higher rates of wages. Although a considerable amount of work was done during the month in connection with repairing ocean liners for the Trans-atlantic passenger season, the trade dispute in the shipyards together with the dockers&apos; strike have caused much dislocation and loss of work. Portsmonth shares in this depression, but hopes are entertained that one of the new cruisers will be built there if the Cruiser Programme is sanctioned by Parliament. The trade is slack at Devonport where interest is now centred in the prospect of obtaining one of the new cruisers. If this work is placed in Devonport, 800 impending discharges may be avoided. At Avonmouth trade improved during the month as repairs were put in hand while vessels were held up in consequence of the dockers&apos; strike. Bristol vards have also shown some improvement and at Cowes 118 additional men were placed on the contract for Greek destroyers, which has been mentioned in previous reports. In Wales there is no appreciable change to report and the position continues to vary considerably in the different ports on the Bristol Channel. There was no great change in the position on the Clyde. All Employment Exchanges in the ship-building area reported a decrease in the live register, but the tonnage of vessels launched during February was less than a third of the tonnage for January. Further orders have been received at Clydebank for two oil tankers; at Dumbarton for a steamer for the Glasgow-Rangoon service; at Port Glasgow for two fair-sized cargo-boats for Norwegian owners; and arrangements have been made at Govan and Linthouse to recommence work on liners on which work has been suspended for a very long time.ENGINEERING.Motor and Cycle Engineering. The employment position is not yet good, but a healthy and optimistic tone dominates the whole industry, and improvement has been considerable during the month. The export trade is still very small, and by far the larger number of cars made are for the home market. Competition is very keen. At Coventry most works are running at high pressure, and the weekly output from there alone is in the neighbourhood of 2,000 cars. In the.motor-car section there has been further improvement at Derby, where the employment position has reached the normal standard. At Nottingham overtime is being worked in several departments. In the Birmingham, Dudley, Tipton and Wolverhampton districts improvement has occurred during the month. In the North-Western Counties the industry has been very active, and many firms have regained the position of a normal output. At Preston, for example, one firm, who have been very slack for the past few years, now employ nearly 1,000 people and a night shift is engaged. The upward tendency in this industry is maintained in the South-Eastern and South-Western Counties, and the trade in light cars has increased to a noticeable degree. The pedal-cycle trade has shared in the seasonal improvement.General Engineering.-In general &quot;engineering, the employment position remains bad, but the tendency towards improvement has become more marked during the period under review. In. the North:Eastern Counties marked improvement has occurred, a firm tone is noticed, in business enquiries and the outlook generally is hopeful. One outstanding feature is the acceptance by the Government of New South Wales of Messrs. Dorman Long and Co.&apos;s (Middlesbrough) tender of  4,200,000 for the construction of a bridge across Sydney Harbour. While the conditions of the contract provide that certain of the lighter materials must be of Australian origin, the greater part of the heavy steel plates will be manufactured in Middlesbrough. The full effect of this order will not; of course, be felt for some time. Some activity prevails in the light engineering trades in the West Riding, and makers of all kinds of tools have better orders booked than for some years. It is reported from Sheffield that the heavy engineering trades are quiet. Foundries and forges have a good deal of railway material in hand. In the North-Western Counties the heavy engineering, textile machinery and machine tool branches of the trade remain depressed and show no signs of early improvement. There has been progress- in building trade engineering, colliery plant manufacture and locomotive works, and makers of electrical machinery are, on the whole, fully employed. In the -Midlands generally small progress is reported. A number of workers in the &quot; key occupations &quot; have resumed work in Birmingham, and this is regarded as a good omen. The machine tool trade is reviving at Coventry, where orders have been received during the monti from Japan, Australia and India. Smethwick has also received orders in this brancb of the trade from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company.   The
engineering trade has improved considerably at Beeston and to some extent at Leicester, Longton, Rugby. Derby, Bilston and Peterborough. Constructional engineering works at Darlaston, Wednesbury and Tipton are more fully employed, and some firms at Tipton are now working full-time. In the Home Counties there is not much improvement. In North London, although trade is still poor, toolmakers are more busy. Improvement has been marked in the South-Western Counties, particularly in railway engineering sections. No material change has occurred in Wales. General engineering has experienced a set-back in Scotland, during the month, and unemployment has increased. Firms have been compelled to &quot;slow up&quot; by applying short-time because their work has gone too far ahead of the shipbuilding sections. There was some improvement in marine engineering in the West of Scotland. ;TEXTILES.Cotton. The general employment position remains bad. The special feature of the period under review is the decision of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners to revert at once to the system of short-time working in the American Spinning Section which was abandoned last November. In future the working hours in the mills in this section will be 26^ per week. , As a result of this arrangement, some thousands of additional cotton operatives, mainly in the Oldham district, will be unemployed and in receipt of benefit for three days per week. The Egyptian Spinning Section continues in a prosperous state and the firms spinning the higher counts of yarn are generally well employed. In the Weaving Section a slight improvement is noticeable and more looms are running than for some time past. Makers of fancy cloths are generally fully employed and the demand for plain cloths has improved during the month.Woollens and Worsteds. A distinct improvement occurred during the month in these industries which appears to be due to orders from the Far East (in particular, Japan) and to seasonal demands in the home trade. The percentage of workpeople unemployed was 6-6 on the 25th February as compared with 9-2 on the 28th January. Employment Exchanges in the West Riding of Yorkshire, dealing mainly with woollen textile workers, reported a decrease in the live registers of 12,224 (including 5,866 men).  The rag trade is reported to be busy.Hosiery.--The employment position remains bad, but signs of early improve-ment have been manifest during the month. Short-time working has decreased to a marked extent in several centres.Lace. Unemployment continues to be very serious, but the position has been eased during the month. Slight improvement is reported in the Plain Net and Curtain Sections, but trade continues poor in the Levers&apos; Section.Silk. The approach of spring is bringing renewed activity, which has already caused some slight improvement in this very depressed industry. In the Leek and Congleton district one firm has received a large order necessitating the working of overtime and another firm has obtained one of the largest orders for silk hose for Vienna ever recorded.   In artificial silk trade continues good.Jute. Trade is brisk in the Dundee district and the shortage of skilled weavers (women) is becoming more pronounced, and preventing mills from running to their full capacity. In the opinion of local employers work could be found for 1,800 more women if they were trained in weaving.Carpets. This industry continues to flourish at Kidderminster.BUILDING AND BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Employment in the building trade remains good and has improved during the month. With the advent of good weather marked improvement has occurred during the month in the painting and decorating branch and the painters&apos; and labourers&apos; live registers have accordingly diminished. This seasonal improvement is manifest somewhat earlier than usual this year. The competition for the available skilled men in the key occupations is keener and special inducements are offered for such workers in some districts.In the brick and tile trade employment generally is good and most branches of the trade have their share in the activity;
CLOTHING.In all branches of the wholesale trade marked improvement is recorded during the month from all districts, particularly London, Leeds, Manchester, Crewe, South-Western Counties and Glasgow. The live registers have reflected the activity in the wholesale branches. Retail and bespoke tailoring and dressmaking show improvement in some districts, but generally trade is still awaiting the spring seasonal activity, which will no doubt shortly follow the lead of the wholesale trade. The corset trade has much improved at Derby. Some advance is reported from Leicester, Rugby and Portsmouth. Employment in the glove-making trade is still poor at Barnstaple, Torrington and Yeovil. The straw hat trade at Luton is considerably affected by the trend of fashion, as the demand at present is for millinery hats instead of straw hats. Women workers who can adapt themselves are absorbed, but many male workers remain unemployed.BOOT AND SHOE.The improvement indicated in the last report has been maintained, but the employment position generally is not yet good. At Northampton prices appear to have been stabilised by the new French decree regarding the export of leather, and buyers are now willing to book forward orders. A new factory is being opened in this centre. Trade is fairly good at Wellingborough, where there is a shortage of machinists experienced in the specialities produced in that neighbourhood. At Rushden export trade is quiet, but factories are fairly busy with new season&apos;s goods. Improvement has occurred at Raunds, where an Admiralty contract has been placed, and at Leicester, where orders have increased for the cheaper classes of footwear. Employment remains goods at Mansfield and Chesterfield, moderate at Wolver-hampton, and bad at Derby, where short-time working is very prevalent.At Norwich, where the manufacture of boots and shoes has now become the main industry, there has been marked improvement. In London and the Home Counties there are signs that the acute depression suffered by this industry is at last lifting.   At Kingswood, Street and Redruth trade remains bad.POTTERY.The employment position remains bad, but there are signs of improvement in many centres following the reductions in prices of the cheaper lines of goods. Trade is fairly good at Burslem and Stoke-on-Trent; improvement is reported from Newcastle-under-Lyme; employment is more steady at Hanley, but short-time working is still prevalent there. Unemployment is most severe among pottery printers, and this is attributed to the increased use made of machine printing and to the decreasing demand for decorated ware. At Derby the china trade continues busy and the position in the porcelain industry at Worcester remains good. Potteries at Barnstaple, Exeter and Poole are busy and there is practically no unemployment in the trade in those districts.TRANSPORT.The docks dispute, which lasted from the 16th to the 25th February, caused a practically entire cessation of work for the period of the dispute. Immediately prior to the stoppage additional labour was engaged to clear cargoes as quickly as possible and increased activity was shown on the termination of the dispute in relieving congestion. Although the dispute caused uncertainty in industry generally, its effect upon other trades was far less than might have been expected. Tn the docks the employment position at the end of the month was much the same as at the time of the last report.   .
III. SUMMARY OF MEASURES APPROVED BY THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF FURTHER UNEMPLOY-MENT BENEFIT, WORK AND TRAINING FOR PERSONS UNEMPLOYED.1. Unemployment Insurance.The gap of three weeks without benefit which was imposed upon persons who had drawn twelve weeks&apos; uncovenanted benefit has been abolished, as from the 21st February, by an Act of Parliament.By administrative action, the following restrictions which had applied to persons receiving uncovenanted benefit have been removed: -(a.) That a single man living with his parents or relatives or any woman living with her husband should not receive uncovenanted benefit if they could reasonably look to others for support.(b.) Claims of persons working short time were rejected if they were earning a sum regarded as sufficient to support them and their dependants.(c.) Certain classes of aliens could not obtain uncovenanted benefit.The present provisions secure that unemployed persons who can show that they are normally employed in an insured trade and required to contribute to the Unemployment Fund when in work, and, further, that they are genuinely seeking work, are eligible for uncovenanted benefit in accordance with the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.2. Juvenile Unemployment Centres.The continuance of these Centres until the 31st March, 1925, has been authorised and the Government have undertaken to pay the total cost of such Centres as from the 1st April, 1924, in lieu of 75 per cent, of the cost as before provided.3. Training and Employment of Women.The Cabinet Committee oh Unemployment hope shortly to be in a position to report to the Cabinet on Unemployment among women.4. Trade Facilities Acts, 1921-22.The Bill now before the House extends the sum for which guarantees may be given from  50,000,000 to  65,000,000, and the time during which the Acts are to operate from the 9th November, 1923, to the 31st March, 1925. A further provision in the Bill empowers the Treasury under certain conditions to contribute towards the interest payable on certain loans raised in connection with public utility under-takings in the Dominions which are calculated to provide work in Great Britain.5. Export Credit Scheme.The Government have approved the scheme and announced their agreement in principle to its extension. The President of the Board of Trade, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is examining the Regulations under which export credits are given with a view to amending any rules which unnecessarily restrict the operation of the scheme.6. Acceleration of Government Work.The following Departments have been authorised to place further orders at once or as soon as possible in anticipation of certain stores or works required, the cost to be met out of the estimates for 1924-25 : (1) War Office to the value of  1,350,000; (2) Office of Works to the value of  44,000. In addition, the Air Ministry has been authorised to accelerate the placing of orders for stores, works, &amp;e, for which provision is made in the Air Estimates, 1924-25.7. Unemployment&apos;Grants Committee.(a.) Authority has been given to the Committee to exceed the existing limit of  20,000,000 (the total value of such schemes to be assisted in 1923-24) by a further  2,000,000, making  22,000,000 in all.(6.) Approval has been given to the policy of assisting works, starting in the spring and summer months instead of confining the schemes to the winter months, in accordance with the previous practice.
(c,) The Committee has been authorised to assist further schemes during 1924-25 to the maximum value of  20,000,000. Local authorities have already been approached, thereby giving them the advantage of three months&apos; additional time in which to consider any schemes which they may be able to undertake during the forthcoming Financial Year. ...(d.) Instructions have been given for the preparation of material which will enable the Government to give further consideration to schemes under which financial assistance is given to public utility undertakings.(e.) The Committee has been authorised to assist schemes on the basis of 60 per cent, of the wages cost during the Financial Year 1924-25 to the extent of  250,000, the further amount to be accordingly provided for in the Committee&apos;s estimates for the forthcoming Financial Year.8. Ministry of Transpprt Road, &amp;c, Schemes.(a.) The Ministry of Transport has been authorised to reopen negotiations with the authorities interested in the scheme for the Liverpool-Manchester Road on the basis that the Government contribution should be fixed in accordance with terms agreed between the Minister and the Treasury.(b.) To prepare for consideration a programme of works for the winter, 1924-25, such a programme to include, among other important undertakings, the North Orbital Road and the New Chertsey Road.(c.) To proceed with certain road and bridge schemes submitted by local authorities, for which no financial provision had hitherto been made.(d.) For the foregoing purposes, the Government have given general approval to the expenditure of  13,500,000.(e.) To prepare for consideration a statement as to the practicability of relieving unemployment by means of an extension of light railways, particularly in agricultural districts, and improvements in the existing canal system.(/.) To take steps to impress upon local authorities concerned the importance, from the unemployment point of view, of proceeding with the Mid-Lancashire, East Midlands and North-West Midlands Electricity Schemes without further delay.9. Ministry of Agriculture Land Drainage, &amp;c, Schemes.The Government have authorised a further expenditure on schemes for the present Winter of  60,000 by the Ministry of Agriculture and  15,000 by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, making the total sums authorised for Land Drainage [ Schemes  310,000 and  50,000 for these two Authorities respectively.  Authority I has been given to both these Departments to undertake Land Drainage and Water Supply schemes next Autumn, and for that purpose to arrange for the necessary preliminary work to be done, during the coming Summer, in order that the schemes i may be able to start early in October.10. Forestry Commission.Authority has been given for a further expenditure of  30,000 on these schemes, making the total for the present season  80,000.11. Miscellaneous Projects. I      (a.) The President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Transport havebeen authorised to urge the Port of London Authority to undertake developmentworks at Tilbury Docks at once. I (b.) The President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Labour have been J requested to enquire and present a Joint Report, upon the position and prospects in j the following industries : shipbuilding, heavy engineering, iron and steel, cotton and I any other basic industries where unemployment has been continuously severe over a j long period.(c.) The present Government has confirmed the decision of the late Government I to assist Local Governments in carrying out the Kenya-Uganda Railway Scheme to I the extent of a loan of  3,500,000 free of interest for five years, repayable thereafter I by annual instalments spread over a period of thirty-seven years.(d.) The Secretary of State for the Colonies has been requested to submit for I consideration other proposals for undertaking Empire&apos; development work.1113891
IY. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia. New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion Authorities concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain of the Dominions, have also been assisted.

Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England and Wales), B (Scotland).These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to 1926 the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Land Settlement.(A.)-England and Wales.
