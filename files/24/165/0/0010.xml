[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1924.SECRET.CP. 110 (24).CABINET.BRITISH DYE-STUFFS COMPANY AND SUGGESTED AGREEMENT WITH GERMAN COLOUR PRODUCERS.Memorandum by the Loud Chancellor.I DO not propose in this Memorandum to travel over ground already covered by papers which are before the Cabinet. What I wish to do is to&apos; make my own suggestions founded on some study of the real point at issue.I believe that the superiority of Germany in this region has been due to her much better organisation, and to the fashion in which she has appreciated and made use of science. It is well known that the first discovery of the production of colour from coal-tar was made by Perkin some seventy years ago. Tho late Prince Consort being much struck with the possibilities which this discovery opened up, got Professor Hoffman one of the greatest chemists in Germany to come over here. The Prince Consort wished to set him to work systematically, but the dyers in England of those days did not appreciate science, and Hoffman had to return to Germany. He went to Berlin as Professor of Chemistry in the University there, and immediately proceeded to develop vast advances in the production of synthetic dyes. He was followed after his death by Professor Fischer, who carried on his work in assisting further developments.In 1900, concerned over this state of things, I went to Berlin and visited the great Technical High Schools at Charlottenburg, where much of the practical work was carried on. There I found that the German colour manufacturers regularly studied the lists of trained students in schools, picked out those who were best, and induced them to come in large numbers to the German colour-producing firms. The result has been an enormous development in the German colour-producing industry. Not only do they make the original colours, but they are constantly discovering new colours and also by-products. Some of the great German firms were recently paying-dividends of 20 per cent, to 25 per cent., whereas in England the dye-stuffs company cannot as yet pay any dividend at all.Recently indeed within the last few days I got hold of one of the largest customers of the British Dye-Stufis Company, himself a dyer and a large shareholder in the company. He told me that in some ways the company was doing quite well; he himself was buying 80 per cent, of his colours from them, whereas before they were established, he only bought 20 per cent, in this country, the rest coming from Germany ; but he said that for the remaining 20 per cent, he was still compelled to go to Germany. England did very well with established colours, but for new shades Germany was the only place to go to (I think he meant to include Switzerland to some extent when he spoke of Germany). I asked him the reason. His answer was that the Germans had put in a much larger volume of intelligence and science into their industry, and that they had been able to make by-products, and it was out of these by-products in the main that they paid their large dividends. I asked him about the directors and staff of the British Company; dealing first with the staff he thought it was very good. The Universities were now turning out first-rate young chemists, and of these he had seen a large number when he visited the British factories of the Company. He thought Perkin, the son or grandson of the original Perkin, who is now one of the main scientific advisers of the British Company, very good indeed, but what he said was that there [11243]13
was not volume enough of science to enable the continually developing discoveries to be made which were necessary in order to keep the colour industry going. He also said that he did not think that the board of directors was as good as it might be. Sir William Alexander, M.P., the chairman, he thought a very able man indeed, well trained in the chemical industry, hut he said that of the other directors he was by no means sure. They seemed to be mostly laymen unacquainted with science. It was a great misfortune that Levenetein and Turner, two of the most competent of the directors, had so quarrelled that both had to be got rid of. There were no others on the board quite like them.I asked the other individual, to whom I referred as connected with one of the great German colour firms, how they managed. I was told that on the board of a German colour company there were also highly trained men of business, but men of business who had had experience of the chemical industry and who knew the work. There were also scientific experts upon the board, and a considerable staff of highly qualified technical advisers, men of originality of mind. r.     -   . ..Turning to the question before the Cabinet, 1 entertain great doubt whether it is safe to let the Germans come in. With their superior equipment, I think that they will dominate the industry. Mot only shall we be dependent upon them for the best know-ledge about the colour industry, but they will get control of our sources of knowledge about explosives and other things besides. It must he remembered that among the by-products of the coal-tar industry are a large number of valuable drugs, as well as things like synthetic indigo, which are of great commercial value. I am not satisfied that we have done the best with the board of directors of the British Company. I do not know Sir William Alexander, but from all I hear it might be difficult, if not impossible, to discover a better chairmanBut I think it very odd that the Government directors should be (as I am informed they are) Lord Ashfield, whose time is taken up with managing the underground railways, and Sir H. Birchenough, who has many other occupations. Surely we ought to take energetic steps, considering the very large investment of the Government in the Company, and its importance to the Exchequer, to secure that the board of directors should be more on a par with that of the German Companies of which I have spoken.Difficult as it is to find scientific men who are equally good in business relations, I do not think that it is impossible. They are needed to suggest new developments, to work with the technical staffs, and to bring things together. I believe that such persons can be found.The chemical industry is a very great one ; apart from the colour industry it is very striking to observe the way in which the great chemical firms in Liverpool, for example, are developing the scientific side in the University there, and have been contributing to it. I, myself, saw a good many of them recently when opening the new chemical laboratories of the University.Finally, I think there is a case for a. small committee of the Cabinet to enquire into the subject, including the question of the agreement, and to report.-     . &quot; 11.February 13, 1924.
