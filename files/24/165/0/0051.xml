questionnaires on the remaining subjeot on theAgenda, viz., development of iauilities for the utiliea-tion of Workers&apos; Leisure.As stated above, these replies have been prepared in consultation with the Departments concerned, and, while they should ho taken as representing the general views of H0Mo Government on the questions at issue, final instruction will have to be given to the British Government Delegates, when the proposals cf the International Labour Office have been circulated, probably towards the end of May, for consideration by Governments.When these instructions are being prepared, I reserve to myself the right to raise certain points of detail.(Intld), T.S.Mi3.1btry of Labour .jst March, 1924 .
INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE. SIXTH SESSION. GENEVA   -    JUNE, 1924.Replies of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government to the Questionnaire prepared by the International Labour Office on Item II of the Agenda.EQUALITY OF TREATMENT FOR NATIONAL AND FOREIGN WORKERS AS REGARDS WORKMEN!S COMPENSATION FOR ACCIDENTS.(1) Do you consider it desirable that the Conference should adopt a Draft Convention concerning equality of treatment for national and foreign workers as regards workmen&apos;s compensation for accidents?     Do yon consider that equality of treatment should be established without any conditions of reciprocity, or that it should be restricted to States which ratify the Convention and which thus mutually undertake to accord to nationals of the other States which are also parties to the Convention the same treatment as is accorded to their own nationals?Or do you consider it preferable that each State should be invited to recognise, by means of separate Conventions with other States, equality of treatment for the nationals of such -States, subject to reciprocity and if necessary to adaptation of the national legislation in the countries concerned?   If so, do you consider that-the decision of the Conference should take the form of a Draft Convention or a Recommendation?Of the two alternatives Indicated in this   QuestionH.M.Government think the former (i.e.a Draft Conventionproviding for equality of treatment) is to be muchpreferred as likely to lead to more definite and practical results.   It would be necessary, however, intheir opinion in order to secure a general acceptanceof the Convention that the application of the convention should be   restricted to the States which ratify it, withthe addition possibly of any other States which, though they may not hax^e ratified, do in fact give identical 0treatment to national and foreign workers.   If such additionwere approved, it would have to be left to each ratifying State to/satify
satisfy   itself as.rospeots any non-ratifying State whioh claimed to he covered by the Convention, that the State in question did in fact extend identical treatment.H.M. Government also deem it important that any euch Convention should so far as possible be limited to the establishment of the general principle and should not concern itself with subordinate questions such as the transfer of funds, special -treatment of transport workers, exemption from fees, and th.fi lik&quot;.     These and all other matters of detail phould in the opinion of E.u. Government be left to be settled, according to the particular circumstances of the States conoemed, by bilateral treaties or other special arrangements.     If, however, it appears to the Conference desirable that some general pronouncement should be made on theso questions, then H.M. Government recommend that such pronouncement should be kept separate from the Convention, e.g., it might be dealt with in a draft Recommendation or a Resolution .(2) Do you oonslder it necessary to stipulate in the&apos;Draft Convention or Eecomsren&amp;ation. that no differentiation of treatment shall bo made as regards foreign workers or their representatives by reason of the place of their domicile or residence?H.M. Govornmftnt are of opinion that it should bestipulated in the draft Conventien that no differen-negotiation should be made as regards foreign workersor their representativee by reason of the place oftheir domicile or residence./(?)
9 r,: Piu v(3) Do you consider it necessary to insert in. the Draft Convention or Recommendation a provision authorising some differentiation of treatment as regards foreign workers or their representatives on account of special oircumstancos?    If so, what, in your opinion, are the ciroumstances in which such differontia-tion might be authorised&apos;Reply. No differentiation of treatment as regards foreign workers or their representatives on acoount of special circumstanoes is made in the British Workmen^ Compensation Acts and the effect of allowing such differentiation unless the ciroumstances in whioh it might be exercised were very closely defined and limited, might be to detract greatly from the value of the Convention.    On present information, therefore, ELM, Government would be against authorising any such differentiation,(4) Do you consider it desirable to insert in the Draft Convention or Recommendation a olause providing for the possibility of transferring funds from which annuities are .to be paid to workors or their representatives who have ceased to reside in the country liable for the payment of compensation?     What are the conditions and reservations which might, in your opinion, govern the carrying out of such a transfer?Reply. Under the British Acts the compensation in oaseof &apos;death is a lump sum whioh is paid into Court and administered by the Court tor the benefit of the dependants.     In the case of incapacity, however, the compensation takes the fort! of weekly payments which an employer cannot be required against his will to redeem by payment of a lump sum.     ELM. Government recognise, however, that the transfer of lump sums may in certain cases be of considerable advantage and they would see no objection to a recommendation that where in/pursuance
pursuance of the law of the State in which &quot;the accident happened, a lump sum has been paid as compensation ard placed under the control cf a Court or a o tate Department or Institution for the benefit of a-foreign workman or bis dependants, such Authority should have the power in the event of the workman or hin dependants removing to or being resident in the country of origin, to authorise the transfer of such sum to the country of origin with a vies to its. application by the proper authorities there for the benefit of ths injured workman or his dependants.   As already indicated, the--&apos; are of opinion that tho actual arrangements in regard to any such transfer, including the method in which the compensation should be dealt with in the country of origin, are matters which must be left to be settled by special arrangements between the particular States concerned and. ought not to be dealt with in the Drrft Convent 1.op.(5)&apos; Do you consider that the Draft Convention or ifte commendation should contain a provision requiring the authorities concerned to lend each other mutual assistance with a view to ensuring the enforcement of the law relating to tforkraen&apos;s compensation for accidents? Or do you consider it necessary that the Draft Convention or Recommendation should define more in detail the methods of such mutual assistance?In the latter oase, what particular provisions do you suggest.H.i&apos;&quot;.Government would be In favour of a general provision requiring the authorities concerned to lend oach other mutual assistance with a view to the enforcement of thoir laws, but consider that themethods of such mutual assistance oapvjot be defined in the Convention but must be left to be the subjectof mutual arrangements between the particular States.7(8)
3 k ^:) O Ij(6) Do you consider that the Draft Convention or Recommendation should contain a clause exempting the relevant documents,certificates, etc, from fees or taxes beyond those payable in the country of origin?Reply.. H.M.Government are not clear what precisely arethe documents, certificates, etc., referred to in this Question and in the absence of precise&apos;Informa-tion are not able to express any definite opinion. Generally, however, they apprehend that the inclusion of any wide exemption of this kind in a Convention might seriously prejudice its ratification, and they would accordingly recommend the omission from the Convention of any such clause.(7) Do you consider that the Draft Convention or Recommendation should provide that any modifications made in the &apos;law or regulations relating to workmen1s compensation for accidents, particularly such as affect the amount of compensation&apos;&apos;1 payable, should apply to foreign workers or their representa-tives on the same conditions as to national workers?Reply. It was not found neoessaary in the Workmen1 compensation (War Addition) Acts of 1917 and 1919. which increased the benefits payable under the British act for total incapacity during the period of the war,., to draw any distinction in respect of foreign workers. It appears, however, to H.M.Government that where an addition is given in one country for some special reason such as the &quot;nigh coat of living, an alien workman who comes from a country ffhere living is much cheaper, has no claim to receive the bonus If  4&apos; he returns to his own country, and they think, that provision might be made to permit of some modification being made in such circumstances.
(8) Do you consider that the Draft Convention or Recommendation should contain spocial provisions regarding certain classes of foreign workers, such as the travelling staff of international railways, or staff belonging to undertakings carried on in two or more coun-tries and temporarily employed in a country which is not their headquarters?As already indicated, EM\ Government are ofopinion that any special arrangements of this kindought to be left to be settled by bilateral or othermutual arrangements between the partioular states concerned, and that the inclusion in the draftConvention of any general requirements (such as those set out in paragraphs (b) and (c) on page IS of the questionnaire) which, though applicable in a lai&apos;genumber of cases, might In partioular circumstances be quite unsuitable, would militate seriously againstthe adoption of the Convention.(9) Are there any other provisions which you consider should be included In tho Draft Convention or Recommendation?H.M. Government would point out that a provision will be required in the Convention reserving powerto the ratifying States to make special arrangements between themselves and any other States oovered bythe Convention which may contain provisions modifying the terms of the Convention in Bone respects, such as,.for example, provisions in regard to the treatment of workmen temporarily dotabhed for employment in another country or engaged in a transport sez^/ice.
9r-&apos; $INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, SIM SESSION. GENEVA   -   JOBS, 1924,REPLIES 01&quot; HIS BRITANNIC MJES3FX&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE PREPARED BY THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFICE ON ITEM III Of THE AGENDA.VfEEKLY SUSPENSION Of WORK FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IN GLASS-MANUMO TURING PROCESSES V/HERE TANK FURNACESARE USED.1.    Do you consider it desirable that theConference should adopt a Draft Convention providing that in glass works where tank furnaces are used operations and classes of work which axe not necessarily continuous from the technical point of view shall be suspended for 24 consecutive hours per week?Be-ply. &quot;H.M. GoTernment would not be in favoar of attempts to secure a weekly rest for workers employed in theseworls by requiring an actual suspension of operations,in view especially of tho fact that automatic machinery which has to run continuously without interruption, iabeing introduced into the industry,,     The object in viewcan, however, be effected without interference with the continuous operation of plant.    All that is necessaryis to provide in the draft Convention that every workerin the processes to which it applies shall, subject tosuch exceptions as may be authorised by the Convention,&quot;be allowed a weekly rest of at least 24 hours.    HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be entirely in favour^ofsuch a provision;   find it would in their view be more in accordance with the objects of theInternational Labour Organisation as laid down in theTreaty (aa well aa with the principles of British/legislation)
2.     If you consider it impossible to proscribe in the Draft Convention that in the whole or part of the glass industry operations and work which are not necessarily continuous from the technical point of view shall be suspended for 24 hours each week, what other period of suspension do you consider might be fixed by the Draft Convention, and to what branches of the glass industry should it be applied?Reply. The question does not arise.3.    Do you consider that this suspension of work ahould, in principle, take place on Sunday, subject to the special conditions in particular countries?Reply^ &quot;The weekly rest should, in accordance with theprinciple indicated in the Treaty, be given wherever possible on Sunday.   It will be necessary, however,in the oaae of the automatic machinery   referred to under 1 to provide that another day may bo-substituted for Sunday.&quot;4.     Do you consider it desirable that the Draft Convention should contain a provision explicitly excluding from its scope such operations and classes of work as must necessarily be continuous for technical  ^ reasons?If so, please give for each of the different bra.nches&quot;of the glass industry/ (sheet glass works, glass bottle works, hollow glass works, plate glass works, etc.)     a list of the operations and classes of work which you consider should be excluded./Itlegislation) than would the proposal in the Questionnaire for the actual suspension of the manufacturing prooess.   H,a. Government strongly recommend that the requirement in the Convention should take this form.&quot;
It is certainly desirable that the Draft Convention.should specifically exclude those workers whose employment must for technical reasons be continuous.     These workers should include the.boiler-attendants and furnace-men, whose employment without interruption would appear to be necessary in all branches of of the glass industry.5.     Dc you consider that permanentexceptions should be allowed to tho general rule suggested unders-(1) for certain special operations or classes of work such as preparatory or complementary work which, while not being necessarily continuous from the technical point of viow, must be carried on during the rest period accorded to the staff as a whole?Do you consider that a list of the classes of work or operations in the different branches of the glass industry to which such permanent exceptions should apply should be inserted In the Draft Convention or should be drawn up by the competent authorities in each country? If you favour the first alternative, ploaae indicate the classes of work oonoernod.It will also   bo necessary to provide for permanent exemptions in respect of certain preparatory work done by   founders and mixers, more particularly in works where the tanks are large, and also in respect of the staff engaged in the maintenance of the plant.     In the opinion of H.k. Government the best course would be to recognise the need for such employment In preparatory and complementary processes in the      0 Clonvontion, but to leave it to the competent authority in each country to prepare a list of the occupations to bo exempted./s.
9 I&apos; *t8.     Do ;;cu consider that these permanent exceptions should be approved after oonaultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, if any?Reply. Tea.7.     Do you consider that provision should ho made for temporary exceptions tw the General rule suggested under, (l)j(a) .,in oases of force majsurej(b) in casos of exceptional pressure of work?Reply,... (a)   tea.(b)   So.   The circumstances of the industry do not make such an exception necessary and there would be danger cf its being abused.8.     Do you consider that temporaryexceptions on aocount of exceptional pressure of work should bo approved after consultation with the organisations of employers and workers concerned, if any?Reply&apos;ii This question does not arise.9.     Do you consider that a period should be allowed before the Convention comes into force?    What period do you suggest, and what transitional measures do you oonsider should be taken during such period?tl2 iiti. So far as this country is concerned, a short period of grace without any transitional measures would suffice.

WOBK  IS   BAKEBIES.q. (l) Do you. esusidex it desirable that the Conference should adopt a Draft Convention on night work in bakeries?A. His Majesty&apos;a Government consider that this is aquestion whioh might properly be dealt with by a DraftConvention on the understanding that the procedurefollowed would be that proposed by the Governing Bodyas set out on page 6 of the Questionnaire. . (2) (a) Do you consider that such a Draft Convention should lay down prohibition of night work in bakeries?(b) If so, what is the length of the nightly rest period whioh should in youn opinion be laid down by the Convention?a. (a) His Majesty&apos;a Government would view with sympathyproposals for eliminating night work from the bakerytrade as far as possible;   but they are satisfied thatit would be necessary fox certain exceptions andexemptions (both temporary and permanent) to be made inorder to meet the public demand fox bxead and to pxeventundue dislocation of trade, and to allow an adequate period of grace in whioh employers oan make arrangements to enable them to comply with the new conditions before the prohibition becomes operative.   (See also index Q.5). (b) The length of the nightly rest should in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;a Government be not leas then 6 -consecutive hours which should fall between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. or exceptionally 10 p.m. and 6 a.m./O)
Q.(3) To what olasssa of undertakings do you consider that the prohibition should apply?So you oonsider that the prohibition should apply to all ol?sses of establishments or that it should be restricted to certain classes only?   \taioh olasaoa would you propose to exclude?A,, His Majesty&apos;8 Government think that, subjeot to thenecessary exception or exemptions referred to below,the prohibition should apply to all &quot;s3.iorto.ki.ng3 and establishments in which persons are employed (otherthan members of the samo family dwelling on the premises)in tho manufacture of bread or flour confectionery foisaleeQ.(4) To what categories of persons do you consider that tho Convention should apply?A. The Convention should, subject to the exceptionsreferred to below, apply to all categories of personsemployed in the manufacture cf bread and flourconfectionery.ft. (5) Bo you oonsider that exceptions to the prohibition -of night work should be laid down?(a) Permanent exceptions for the execution of pre-paratory and supplementary work;(b) Temporary exceptions in the case of a seasonal or temporary influx of population, e,g0 during the period of seasonal activity in pleasure or health&apos; resart3, during lo^al festivals., fairs, markets, e on grounds of publio interest, esg0 for supplies t the Army, etc; in the oase of repair work, accidents and force majouse.A. Bxoeption3 to the prohibition should be laid down asfollows.-(&amp;) Permanent exceptions.(i) Provision should be made for the execution of preparatory and supplementary work by the exemption of dough makers, and oven firemen and their assistants..
(ii) Night work on one night a week should beallowed to meet the requirements of the week-end trade.     This in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is essential, (b)     Temporary except i ons.Temporary exceptions should be allowed for the purpose mentioned in the Question and also to meet the needs of the public on the occasion of national holidays and festivals;It will also be necessary in view of the alterations which may be required in many cases in premises or in plant, and the difficulties which employers may encounter in some classes of trade in making it commercially possible to carry on their business without night work, to provide in the   Convention for a period of grace and His Majesty&apos;s Government recommend that each State should be allowed to postpone the coming into operation of the prohibition for a period of two years and to grant, a further extension of time &apos;in special cases.On this subject and in general His Majesty&apos;s Government would direct attention to the &quot;Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Night Work in the Bread Making and Flour Confectionery Trade&apos;1 1919.    (Cmd. 246).Q.(6) Do you consider that the Convention should contain a clause authorising the authorities in each country to grant permanent exceptions to the prohibition of night work in favour of undertakings where work is organised on industrial lines and which employ more than a certain number of persons&apos;   In what way do you consider that night work in such undertakings should be regulated (e.g. limitation of night work to one week in three?).A, The main ground for the prohibition of night work inbakeries as at present carried on being, in the opinionof His Majesty1s Government, the continuous night work/which
9   which involves serious interference with social life, there is in their view no justification for any discrimination as regards prohibition between large and small bakeries, or between undertakings organised on one method rather than another, but they consider that it would be reasonable to make an exception in favour of establishments where it is arranged, either by organising the work on a system of shifts or otherwise, that no individual worker is employed at night more often than one week in three.
