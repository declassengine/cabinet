A.DRAFT- - KiSIEGRiMo to five Dominions. (Copy to go to Irish Free state by despatch.)Secret and Urgent, March. Singapore.Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister beginso   I brought your reply to my message of 5th March together with replies from  he other Prime Ministers before Cabinet today.   We are deeply sensible of sympathetic attitude which other parts of the Empire hare shewn to the principles on which our proposed policy is founded even though all do not feel able to endorse the methods by-which we consider that those principles can best be carried out. After having carefully examined replies we feel bound to make statement in Parliament following., with minor alterat-ions, that in Secretary of State&apos;b telegram of 6th March. We are proposing however also to mate clear to Parliament toncer of replies to my message of -5th March and Secretary of State for Colonies is&quot;&apos;telegraphing to you separately text cf proposed summary,   [This procedure seems preferable to publishing complete text of correspondence since latter to some extent indicates trend of confidential discussions at Imperial Conference,,    Question of fuller publication can, if necessary, be considered later.   I am forwarding copies.. Communication to Parliament will be made on Tuesday after-noon March 18th.   Similar message sent to other^Prime Ministers.   Ends.
si a \jSIATMMT OP POUOx II ESGAPJ) TO 31HGAP0EE1,.We have given careful consideration to the proposal to develop the naval Base at Singapore.   We have closely studied the reasons which led to the adoption., of this project, and the arguments in support of its continuation urged upon us from the uoint of view of naval defence.We had, however, to consider the matter in a wider relationship, and eame to the conclusion that we could not ash Parliament to proceed with this scheme.   We were convinced that if we were to do so our action would exercise a most detrimental effect on oxtr general foreign policy.   As we have repeatedly stated, we stand for a policy of international co-operation through a strengthened and enlarged league of llation the settlement of disputes by conciliation and judicial arbitration, and the creation of conditions whioh will make a comprehensive agreement on limitation of armaments possible. As stated in the Prime Minister&apos;s letter to-Mr, Poincare of February 21st, - &quot;our task meanwhile must be to establish confidence, and this task can only be achieved by allaying the international suspicions and anxieties which exist today.&quot;It seemed clear, apart from.any other considerations, that, to continue the development of the Naval Base at Singapore would hamper the establishment of this confidence and lay our good faith open to suspicion.   Whilst maintaining present standard in a state of complete efficiency, we take the view that it would be a serious mistake to be responsible for new developments that could only be justified on assumptions that would definitely admit that we had doubts in the success of our own policy.   As a result we should almost inevitably drift *into a condition of mistrust and competition of armaments in the *Wf East.Having provisionally reached the conclusions which I^ve sat out, we felt it our duty in view of the discussions at- M\ the
C&apos; tf Uthe recent Imperial Conference to communicate with the Governments ofthe self-governing Dominions;   vve therefore put the position before them and invited their views.    I propose to give theHouse a summary of these views.   She Ocnadian Government toll us .that they wish to refrain from any advice on the problem.The Irish free State has adopted, a similar attitude.   Asto Australia, Hew Zealand and Newfoundland I must explain quite clearly that their Prime Ministers wish, and indeed urge, us toproceed with the Base.    The Commonwealth Government express cordialsympathy with our international policy of conciliation.   Theytell us that the desire in Australia is for a better understandingamong the nations and a definite reduction of armaments on every possible occasiouc   They consider however that the action whiohwe propose, instead of assisting the policy in view, willjeopardise it in that any reduction in the mobility of theFleet will reduce our influence in the Councils of the Nations.If the development of the Singapore base (the intention toproceed with which was,, they point out, well understood at the timeof the Washington Conference) is now to be discontinued, australia would rather see this step taken as a. means for securing further international agreement for mutual reduction of armaments/The Hew Zealand Government attach great importance to development of the Base, their opinion being founded mainly on grounds of naval strategy.   Whilst laying stress on the view that its use is for defensive and not offensive purposes, they feel that the interests of the British Empire in the Pacific will be endangered should our capital ships be unable to operate in those waters, and that the time has not yet come to rely solely on the influence for Pesce of the League of Nations,I should add that the Commonwealth Government have informed us of their readiness to submit proposals to their Parliament for a substantial contribution to the development 0? the base,   Hew Zealand has already generously offered a first oontribution of  100,000 towards it.Lastly from South Africa we have heard from general smuts
Smuts that our proposed policy whiah he describes as &quot;a bold move towards enduring peace&quot; meets with his wholehearted agreement,,   He feels that the authority of the British Empire as the protagonist of the great cause of appeasement and conciliation among the nations would be seriously undermined . by the construction of the Singapore base.,From the above summary, I think I may claim that we have a large measure of sympathy in the Dominions with our international policy, even if all parts of the Empire do not feel able to endorse the methods by which we consider that that policy should be carried out to   The criticisms are founded, in the main, on the conception that the Singapore base is essential as part of a complete defensive Pacific strategy.. Should the practical necessity for putting such a strategy into operation arise by reason of the condition of world politics and a return to attempts to provide Imperial security primarily by armaments, the whole question would have to be re-considered, but in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government that has not now arisen, and it is the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to try and prevent its arising.We have every confidence in our policy, and we feel that a decision not to proceed with the Jtfaval Base at Singapore will give that policy the best possible chance of success and Is an earnest of our good faitiu
