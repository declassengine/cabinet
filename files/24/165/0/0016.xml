J. &amp; 1THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.&apos;C A B I g g T.SCHOOL TEACHERS SUPERANNUATION BILL, 1924.OBSERVATIONS BY THE SECRETARY POR SCOTLAND ON THE MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION.  (C.P. 92 (24)).ggORJjT. i5.P. 116241, Agreed,  subject to the caveat that the system established under the principal Act of 1918 is not analogous to the Civil Service system.     It is fundamentally different in two important respects -(a) While under both systems pension depends upon salary,under the latter the State, which pays the pension, fixes the salary, whereas under the former the Local Authority, which fixes the salary, has no re-spcn3ibility whatever for payment of the pension.(b) Under the latter no potential beneficiary, who has not become physically or mentally incapable,  can quit the service before sixty without entire loss of his superannuation rights, whereas under the former the potential beneficiaries are free to come and go up to the age of sixty-five without any detriment to such superannuation rights as may have accrued.2.     Agreed.3.     The Educational Institute, which is the only repre-sentative Association of Teachers in Scotland, does not desire that permanent legislation for England and Wales should be postponed, since postponement for England and Wales would mean postponement for Scotland also.     They hold -(l) That the continuance of the Act would mean a continu-ance of the anxiety, worry,&apos; and sense of insecuritythat/
that have harassed, teachers since the Act was first passed.(ii) That postponement would he a breach of a definitepromise given by the Government during the dis-   -cussion on the 1922 Bill, (iii) That the 1922 Act violates a generally accepted and well recognised financial principle, inasmuch as it misapplies an asset which is specifically pro-vided to meet a definite liability, and uses for present needs what really belongs to the future.(iv) That the conditions&apos; which attach to the possible re-turn of contributions under the 1922 Act are manifestly unfair and are such as obtain in no other pension scheme,As to the arguments for postponement cited in the esident&apos;s Memorandum -\ ,(a) The Emmott Committee, which contained representatives of the Treasury and the Board of Education, went into the question most fully and presented a unanimous Report.     The only further discussion that is needed is Parliamentary discussion.(b) It is obvious that the two questions of superannuation and salaries are closely interrelated.     But to at-tempt to settle salaries before settling superannua-tion would be to put the cart before the horse. Superannuation will be settled once for all;    salariesv must be revised periodically.     Any attempt to build a permanent structure on a shifting foundation would, lead to endless trouble.     As to the Local Edu*-ation Authorities, if the burden is more than they can fairly be asked to bear, any assistance that they need should be given them directly in the shape of an increased grant, not indirectly in the shape of relief/
relief from all responsibility for the payment of pensions.of Teachers imply that that body are prepared to accept a   &apos; permanent measure?     If so, it would be yery desirable to have a definite undertaking from them to that effect before agreeing to any limitation.4.     If it would be difficult to make sure of passing a permanent measure before the autumn of 1925, that contingency might be met by making the temporary Bill expire on March 31gt, 1925, with power to extend its operation for a further period by Order in Council.   If there be objections to possible extensions by Order in Council, an alternative would be to fix July 3lBt, 1925, as the definite date for expiry.     This would be less convenient for the Exchequer than March 31st-, but more con-venient for teachers and for local Education Authorities.tinuance of the temporary Act is true in so far as concerns the only figures quoted.     If, however, a somewhat- wider view be taken, there is no financial advantage whatever-.     Every fresh year of postponement means a very heavy addition to the huge liability for &apos;back service&apos; which is being piled upon the Exchequer.     The bill for &apos;back service&apos; must be honoured-, and it will fall due at a time when money will be more urgently needed than ever to meet the pressing requirements of educa-tional and social reform.     It is most undesirable to allow it to become still further swollen. My own view is -(l)   That a scheme on the lines of the Emmott Report, ought to be put into force as soon as possible.(2)   That the Government&apos;s intention to this effectDoes the sentence relating to the National UnionWhat is said as to the financial advantage of a con-(3); should be announced at the earliest opportunity-. That, if a temporary -Act is necessary, it should expire on 31st July, 1925.,&quot;W. A&quot; .Scottish Office, Whitehall.15th February,  1924-,
