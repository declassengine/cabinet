Adairal,The Cabinet will remember that in the summer of last year, 1923, the relations of the H&amp;vy and the Air Force were referred to a 3u.h-Coim.ittee (consisting of the Earl of Balfoar, Viscount peel, and Lord Weir) of the Committee of Imperial Defence.Report which was approved by the late Government, Difficulties, however, have arisen on the Interpretation of that Report, and I regard it as essential that inasmuch as it is most important that both the Admiralty and the Air Ministry should set to work: in organising the Fleet Air Arm an authoritative interpretation should be given to that document,! I ask then - that a Cabinet Committee should be appointed to make that interpretation,I do not propose to trouble the Cabinet with the points at issue, but I shall ba prepared, if the Cabinet agree to this course being taken, to circulate a Memorandum for the Committee.On July 23vd 1923, their Report was issued, a(Intld. )     C.7th March 19 24.
