J.Ministry of Health, Whitehall,S.W.1.19th February, 1924.:
mm RESTRICTION BILL. 1924.(Presented by Mr. Benjamin Gardner, M,P. Second Reading, Friday, 22nd February).Clause lfThe Increase of Rent, and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, is.the Principal Act.     That Act was amendod by the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923, and the latter Act prolonged the duration of the Prinoipal Act until June 1925.     Part II of the Act of 1923 provided for a modified form of control after the expiry of the principal Act.     Clause 1 of the present Bill provides&apos; for the prolongation of the Principal Act until 24th June, 1928, that ia, 3 years longer than was provided for by the Act of 1923.     It will be observed that under the 1923 Act the termination of tho Principal Act was fixed at a date coinciding broadly with the duration of the Chamberlain Housing Scheme, and it may be said that if the Housing scheme is to be extended until 1928 the Rent Restrictions Act should be similarly prolonged.Olause 3,Section 4 of the Act of 1923 re-enacted with modifications Section 5 of the 1920 Act which dealt with the restrictions on the rights of a landlord to recover possession. Clause 2 of the Bill amends the conditions under which a landlord may obtain possession in the following ways:-Sub-olause (1)(a) provides that one of tho grounds on which a landlord may apply for possession of a house Is * where any rent lawfully due has through the wilful default of the tenant not been paid, or any other obligation of the/tenancy
tenancy has through.the wilful aot or default of the tenant not &quot;been performed.This paragraph differs from the paragraph in the last Aot by the addition of the underlined words.Shb-olaqse (1) fb).   This sub-olause deals with the right of a landlord to cue for recovery where the tenant or some person residing with him or Mb lodger has been guilty of conduct which  is a nuisance or has used the premises for Immoral or illegal purposes, eto. It differs from the corresponding provision in the existing Act by being oonfined to eases where tho person has been repeate^y guilty of suoh conduct after tho landlord has served upon the tenant a written notioe calling upon him ,to stop the nulsanoe.Sub-olause (1) (a).   At present the position is that a person who became the landlord before the 30th June, 19&amp;2, and desires possession for his. own oeoupation, or for that of a grotm-up son er daughter, is entitled to apply for an order for possession and does not have to prove that alternative accommodation exists for the tenant   whom he seeks to displace.      In the/*aso -
case of a person who did not become the landlord until after June 30th, 1922, the landlord oannot get possession unless he can prove either that it would be a greater hardship to keep him out of his house than it would be to turn out the tenant, or that alternative accommodation exists for the tenant.     The new sub-clause amends ths present provisions.(i) by withdrawing the right of a landlord to obtain possession on the ground that he desires the house for the occupation of his son or daughters(ii) by providing that In all cases he can only obtain possession for his own occupation where alternative accommodation for the tenant exists. The sub-clause further deprives the landlord of any right to recover possession on the ground that he requires the house   &quot;for any person bona fide residing with him, or for some person engaged in his whole-time employment or in the whole-time employment of some tenant from him or *?ith whom, conditional on housing accommodation being provided, a contract for such employment has been entered into&quot;.
/. e/ uSub-clause (1) (d).    This sub-clause repealo paragraphs (f) and (g) of subsection (1) of Sootlon 4 of the 1923 Act.Paragraph (f) provides that where a landlord became the landlord after service during the War and requires tho house   for his own occupation he may obtain possession of part of the house if the Court is satisfied that the accommodation reserved in the other part of the house Is reasonably sufficient for the tenant.Paragraph (g) provides that an order for possession can be given where the dwelling house is required for occupation by a former tonant who gave up occupation to serve in the War.Sub-clause (1)(eV  provides in effect that alternative accommodation must be available in all oases whore a landlord obtains possession except in the special cases dealt with in paragraphs (a) (b) and (o) of Section 4 of the Act of 1923. Under tho present Acts the existence of alternative accommodation is not a condition of an order or (judgment in any of the following cases--(i) where the tenant occupies his dwelling house by virtue of his employment and ceases to bo in that employment;(II) in the case of agricultural cottages wherepossession of the cottago is required for a person engaged or to be engaged on agricultural work; (iii) where the landlord gave up occupation in order to servo in the War;(iv) whore the landlord became the landlord before30th June, 1922, and requires the house for his own occupation or for the occupation of&apos;a grown-up son or daughterj
(v) where the landlord did not become the landlord       *f   a before the 30th June, 198;?. but requires the house for his own occupation or for the oooupa-txon of a grown-up eon or daughter and the Oourt is satisfied that it would be a greater hardship to refuse the order than to grant it. Sub-clause (l)(f) repeals subsections (fi) and (7) of subsection (1) of Section 4 in the 1923 Act.     Those sub-sections provide for penalties on the landlord where it is proved that he has obtained an order for possession by mio-representing or concealing the material facts.    It is no doubt considered that these subsections are not needed in view of the previous provisions in tho Bill providing that a landlord can only obtain possession when there ic alternative accommodation for the tenant.Sub-clause (3).     This BUbolause provides that where an order for possession has been given before the passing of the Act but has not been executed the Court shall, on tho application of the tenant, rescind or vary tho order in such manner as may be requisite for the purposes of giving effect to the new Act. ,Clause 3.     This clause deale with the-permitted lnoroases of rent.    Under Sections 1 and 2 of the Act of 1920 the maximum increases in rent which a landlord could ohargo were fixed at 40 per cent, of the net rent, made up of 15 per cent (which was intended both to oovor the permitted increase in the rate of mortgage interest and to provide an additional return on the landlord&apos;s capital) and 25 per cent (which was intended to cover the extra cost of repairs carried out by the landlord).     Clause 5 of the Bill reduces the 15 per cent to 10 per cent and the 2-5 per cent to 15 per cent, making the total permitted increase 25 per cent.Clause 4.   Provides for a reduction in rent when the rates payable by the landlord are reduced.     Under the 1990 Act where a landlord pays the rates ho is entitled to pass on to the tenant any increase
in the rstes over the rates In 1914.   Until recently it was assumed that conversely where the rates, fere reduced the landlord could only pass on to the tenant the reduced amount 0f r,?.tes.   Jn a case, however, which came before the King1 a Bench on the 8th February last (Strickland v. Palmer) the Court held that once rent had been increased to cover an increase of rates there was nothing to compel the landlord to reduce the rent when the rates went down.   It is under-stood that notice has been given of an appeal against this decision.Clause 5. repeals sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the1923 Act which provides that when a house becomes vacant it shall cease to be subject to the Rent Restrictions Acts. Clause 6.Sub-clause (1).    Section 5 of the Act of 1923 provides that where the tenant obtains from the sanitary-authority a certificate that the house is not in reasonable state of repair, and has served a copy of the certifleate upon the landlord, it shall be a good defence to any claim against his for the payment of any increase of rent per-mltted under paragraph (o) or paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1920 in respect of any subsequent rental period that the house was not in a reasonable state of repair during that period.   Paragraphs (c) and (d) are the paragraphs under which the increases of 15 per cent and 25 per cent respectively are permitted. The effect of omitting the reference to these paragraphs would be to make it a good defence to any claim for the Payment of any permitted increase of rent, that is to say, not merely to the increase of rent permitted under paragraphs (c) and (d) but also to the other increases permitted under pr graphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Act
i.e. the increases permitted on account of structural alterations and increase of rates.

Sub-clause (2) provides that the production of the certificate of the sanitary authority mentioned above shall have the same effect as the service of a copy of it.

Clause 7.  This clause repeals Section 7 of the 1923 Act which provides that, in addition to the increases of rent permitted under the Act of 1920, further increases may be allowed in the case of sub-tenancies, viz: an addition of 10 per cent of the sub-tenant&apos;s not rent, and an addition to the tenant&apos;s rent of 5 per cent of the suh-tenant&apos;s not rent.
Rent Restrictions Bill.MEMORANDUM.The object of this Bill is to amend in the interests of the tenants the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts, 1920 and 1923. Under its provisions the Act of 1920 is continued until 1928, the powers of landlords in respect of recovery of possession are greatly curtailed, the rents recoverable are materially diminished in amount, and any increase in rent in respect of rates is reduced in the event of a reduction in the rates. The Bill applies to all dwelling-houses to which the above-cited Acts apply, including, however, the dwelling-houses now excluded from their operation by subsection (1) of section two of the Rent and Mortgage Interest Re-restrictions Act, 1923.
