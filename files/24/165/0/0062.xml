(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).SECRET. .CP.160(24) C A B I X E T.. &apos;    1^HOME   AFFAIRS   COMHTTTEE.Marriages Provisional Orders.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I circulate the draft of a one-clause Bill to amend the Provisional Order (Marriages) Act,  1905. .Before 1905.if any marriages, though contracted bona fide by the parties, were found to be ir^vlid or of doubtful validity by reason of some informality (o.g. solemnisation in an unregistered building)&apos; it was necessary to pass a special Marriage Legalisation Bill (a public Bill) to remove the invalidity or doubt. , The Act of 1905 simplified the procedure by empovrering a Secretary of State to make a provisional order which is confirmed by a Bill dealt with under the Private Business procedure.In the old Marriage LegalisationActs it was customary to insert a clause making the registers of the marriages validated receivable in evidence as if the marriages had been duly solemnised and another clause relieving the officiating minister from all penalties if he was not responsible for the irregularity. Similar clauses have been inserted where proper in provisional orders made under the Act of 1905, but last year it. was pointed out in the House of Lords that the Act only empowers the Secretary of State to &quot;make a provisional order for the purpose of. removing the invalidity or doubt&quot; and gives no power to insert any. other clauses in the order.     An amending Bill is accordingly necessary to enable any such necessary supplemental provisions to bo included in the order.The Bill is not likely to prove at all controversial, and I would suggest that it be introduced in the House of Lords as the necessity for it was first pointed out In that House.A.H.&quot;th March,  1924.
