(This document is the property of Hie Britannic. Ma je styles Governments)CABINET.IjM3 ret. j,p. 150(24).Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Guardianship of Infants Bill.9 fl^w :&apos;jIn reply to a Question on this subject by Mrs. Wintringham on 18th February, the prime Minister said -&quot;Tho Government have this matter under consideration, and are willing to confer with the promoters of the Bill now before Parliament, and with others interested, with a view to seeing whether agreement can be reached as to the main provisions to be included in any Measure on this subject.&quot;This reply was given after consultation with the Home Office and I now recommend that the Cabinet should appoint a email Committee to consider this question and to confer with those who are supporting Mrs. Wintringham&apos;s Bill and with those Members of the House of Lords who have in previous Sessions supported a measure on the subject.Legislation for equal guardianship involves substantial difficulties of a legal and administrative character, and it will be necessary to consider with care what provision&apos;, can be allowed to pass into law.   Last Session a Joint Select Committee was appointed to consider Bills on tho subject, but this Committee failed to agree or to make a report.I would suggest that.one of the Law Officers should be a member of the Committee, and that the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary should be represented. ^The subject ic one which has for a long time been pressed by many women&apos;s societies, and no doubt many Members of the House of Commons have given pledges &apos;on the subject;A. H.Srd March, 1924.
