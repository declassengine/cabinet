G-.4DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV3RMMEMT.Ist:CIIET. CABINET.P. 113 (24)CENSUS OF PRODUCTION. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate herewith, for the information of my Colleagues, a note explaining what has taken place in respect of the Census of Production in the past.   I have ascertained that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is in agreement with me as to the desirability of taking anotlier CenoUB as soon as possible and, if the Cabinet concur, it is my intontion to proceed with the arrangements contemplated by my predecessor in issuing an Order authorising a Census for 1924.If it should prove that serious labour or other disturbances in the near future render 1924 an unsuitable year for taking the record, it will be possible to cancel the Order.   No considerable expenditure will be incurred before the Autumn of this yoar in any case and before that time it should be possible to determine whether, in spite of the need for information as soon as possible, deferment for a further year is desirable.S.W.Board of Trade,15th February, 1924.
: Ii - f I&apos; li iCENSUS OP PRODUCTION, .;.      flIn 1906 an Aot of Parliament was passed conferring on the Board of Trade certain powers for taking, from time to time, a Census of Production in the United Kingdom. The First Census taken under the Act covered the output of 1007, and the Report on that Census constitutes the only complete survey yet published of the industrial production of this country.   It is obvious that the interval of 17 years, accentuated by the great changes consequent on the War, has rendered the information very unreliable as a guide to the present industrial structure.   A later survey was made relating to the output of 19IS, but the work on the Returns secured was interrupted by the War at a,stage which rendered it impossible to complete the compilation of the. details later on without a considerable amount of information no longer accessible to the firms concerned after so considerable an interval.   The Census which fell due during the War, that for 1917, was, of course, postponed, and, in order to meet the difficulty, an Act was passed enabling the Board to vary the regular quinquennial succession of Censuses. Later a Census for 1920, limited to the more important industries (in order to reduce the expense), was contemplated, but, on grounds of economy, the Cabinet finally decided against proceeding then with the enquiry.   Another order was made providing for a Census for 1922 but, in view of the Report of the Geddes Committee, it wa3 announced in Febmary, 1922, that the Census would not be proceeded with.The following are examples of the questions living an   \ important bearing on policy, on which a Census of Production would throw light:- the relation of our foreign trade to our home productions whether tho output hao increased or deoreased in proportion to the numbers engaged; the real       (-1-   - i!
0 s)offeots of the price changes since the War, as price movements have affected very differently the various great branches of industry and the relative outputs of these Industries have altered; the amount of the National Income, for an estimate of which the data of a Oensus of Production furnishes an invaluable basis, and on that basis the contributions of different branches of industry can he compared,    a new Census of Production will be of the utmost value from the point of  view of industrial,commercial, agricultural and taxation problems as well as to tho business community direotly.The estimated cost of a Census of Production for 1924, including certain Agricultural enquiries supplementary to those carried out annually, amounts to about  90,000 together with the expenses of stationery, printing, postage and the housing of the staff employed.   The expenditure would be spread over four years; about  8,500 only would be required in the financial year 1924-5, in which preparatory work would be done, and the bulk of the expenditure would be incurred in the two following years.I am strongly of opinion that, despite the cost, it is of great importance to proceed with a Census of Production in respect of 1924.   The necessary preliminary steps in the making and laying of an Order were taken by the last Government to enable this Government to proceed with a census in respeot of 1924 if they should decide to do so.   Decision is needed at onoe, as we are being asked whether the Order is to stand or not, and manufacturers ought to be told without delay, since the fonn in which they have to keep their accounts is involved.
APPENDIX.Nature and Scope of the Census of Production.The matters on which information was to be secured under compulsion included the character, quantity and value of output, numbers of persons employed, aggregate estimated value of materials used, and particulars of power generated or used.   Particulars of the hinds and quantities of materials used and information as to wages paid were definitely excluded from the matters to which the compulsory powers of the Act extended, and enquiries as to capital and profits were not dealt with in the Act.   The powers of the Board in enquiring as to quantity of output were restricted, the quantities being only exigible in respect of goods for which quantities are required to be returned in the case of like goods imported or exported.   This last restriction has become of considerably les3 importance than formerly, owing to tho expansion of the Import and Export List for 1920, which has been&apos; maintained in subsequent years0   Questions of a  voluntary character are admissible for the purpose of securing information not Included in the compulsory schedules.On the occasion of the Second Census the enquiry was somewhat more restricted than that relating to 1907, businesses employing not more than five persons on the average being exempted, as were also the Building Trades.The former exemption might well be maintained at the next enquiry, since the extent of the output not brought under review is relatively unimportant while the expense and trouble involved is altogether out of proportion to the-importance of the data thus omitted.   The exemption of the Building Trades in 1912 was in part due to the great difficultly
experienced at the First 0ensue In making the enquiry complete and satisfactory.   It 1b hoped that these difficulties may be loss in 1924 than before the Institution of unemployment insurance in the Building Trades.The making of the Order and its publication provide a warning to manufacturers that the needed accounts must be kept, but, aa a sensible fraction of the whole make up accounts to June SOth in eaoh year, and in such cases particulars for the business year of the firm are accepted, Returns will not be available for summarising till after the middle of 1925, quite apart from the effects of the delay of three month accorded by the Act to manufacturers in the making of their Returns,   The fact that a considerable time must elapse before the results of a Census can become available renders further delay in the starting of en enquiry the more undesirable.The experience of the work in the earlier enquiries will enable the material for a new Census to be so grouped as to furnish important information concerning the relation of the size of the productive unit to the amount of the product, and to the distribution of output in different industries between businesses under private, and those tinder corporate,, control.   Such information should be of much value in the consideration of numerous financial and social problems.It may be noted that the census of manufactures in the United States, formerly taken at intervals of five years, is now taken, every second year,and that in Canada, in Australia, in New Zealand and in South Africa yearly surveys are now made. It is of importance that we should be able to measure .our relative position at short intervalsv &apos;.
