THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.LONDON   TRAFFIC   BILL. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.SECRET. 1. In his Memorandum on the London Traffic Bill,0.P.170(24). (Q.P.165(24)), the Minister of Transport refers to the threatened dispute on the London Tramways, a dispute in which the parties appear determined to try to link the merits of the dispute with the provisions of ths Traffic Bill.     It is most essential, In my view, that the two should be kept distinct.2.. The caso for the London Traffic Bill should depend upon &quot;traffic&quot; merits only: neither party to the wages dispute should bo allowed to argue that, because owing to competition the trams are not making profits (and therefore cannot pay the higher wages demanded) the Government should legislate in a particular manner and (by restricting competition) ensure increased profits and, presumably, increased wages.     A legislative programme based upon this policy would extend throughout (while at tho same tine it shortened) the life of any Government.3. I entirely agree with the proposals of tho Minister of Transport as to the constitution of tho Statutory Committee for London Traffic.     The manner in which the interosts concerned are attempting to involve the Government in the dispute between the Trilhsport Workers&apos; Union and tho London Tramway Authorities indicates oloarly that the provisions of the proposed legislation/should
should be suoh as to prevent tho Government from beooming responsible In any way for the rates of wages   of tram or bus workers,4, In connection with the dispute. I think it Is desirable that my colleagues should have in mind the con-stitutional pooition.     Tho wages of tramwaymon throughout the country are regulated by a National Joint Industrial Oounoll upon which both municipal and private oompany Interests are represented.     There is a District Council for oach area, including London,     Wages applications are considered in the first place by the District Councils and, failing agreement, must be considered by tho National Oounoll before a stoppage of work can occur.The application is for an increase of 8/- a week for tramwaymen, and the London District Council has not yet reached a dooieion.    The Employers&apos; Side has pointed out that under present conditions they aro unable to give any increase of wages and they have Indicated that their power to raise wagoo is dependent upon the restriction of competing traffic.     The Oounoil are mooting again this week for the further consideration of the matter, and, if the two sides fail to agree, the matter should bo considered by the &apos; National Oounoil.     If a stoppage were to occur without this procedure being followed, it would be expected, that the -whole of the joint maohinery would come to an end, and I think that both sides will have-this in mind in their further consideration of the position.If the further negotiations result in a deadlock and a stoppage of tramways were threatened, I should of course consider, as an impartial authority, what action under the Industrial Courts Act is advisable.5. In the meantime, I strongly support the proposal of the Minister of Tranoport as to the constitution of the Advisory Committee for Lcndon Traffic.^ il.try of Labour. (Intld.) T.
