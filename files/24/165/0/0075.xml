POCoiiBHS ^*flRj?ROIBffl!Y Qg HIS BBIIEAMIO mJ&amp;sm1^ QOVBBMfcB3!.0.P.171J84J.&apos;/,7G&amp;BINET.POSITION Off IHDIAm .IQijgX&amp;* Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the&apos; Colonies..It has been agreed, at Colonel Wedgwood&apos;sinstance, that the Cabinet should consider theposition created by his statement in the House ofCommons on the 25th. of July, 1923, which has beeninterpreted in some quarters as a pledge binding thelabour Government&apos; to take immediate action to revise the decisions contained in the tfhite Paper (Cmd.1922.)which gave rise to the Debate.Colonel wedgwood1s statement was as follows:-&quot;It is not easyj when a step like this has once been taken ever to put it right; but I am certain the party I have the.honour to speak for to-night when their turn comes will do,their best,,    I cannot say more than, that, because heaven knows what the repercussion of this will be before that time..    But we will do our best to establish justice and fair play throughout the British . .     Empire and put an end to what is ruining our chance of real peace and development.&quot;He added that the Labour Party would not be heldbound by the White Paper decision.   He also stated that&quot;If I were to advise my kenya Indian friends what to do about the settlement I would say to them &quot;Accept it.    It is all you can get, and all you can expect, Bo not suppose thst you have got justice, It is not your business any longer.    Take the five seats and elect your&quot;men.   Put or men who will stand up for your rights.      * Lo not adopt the silly policy of non-co-operation which has ruined the political situation in India.   Get on the Council and. carry on.1&quot;It is necessary to add that, shortly after taking office, I mentioned.publicly that, as at present advised,J  : ^&apos;-l- WM :
a P* Q$ JI proposed to be guided by the White Paper decisions.It is not necessary now to gc into all the matters contained in the White Paper.    It laid down the general principle that  while the rights of the non-native communities must be safeguarded, native interests must, in case of conflict, be paramount, and it discussed various points at issue between the European and Indian communities.   Of these, &quot;Land in the Highlands&quot; was decided in favour of the Europeans and &quot;segregation in Townships&quot; in favour of the Indiana; on the franchise, a compromise was laid down, and on the question of immigration a general principle of controlling immigration (irrespective of race) in the economic interests of the native was recognised, and it was decided that the Governors of JLenya and Uganda should confer and report on what was required.The Ordinance giving effect to the new franchise was urgentj as the general election of the Legislative Council had already been postponed, for a year pending settlement, and the Governor appears to have considered that, in order that the measure might be accepted by the European members, the Immigration Bill should.be introduced at the same time.   He had agreed with the Governor of Uganda on a draft which provided, principally, that the entry of a would-be employee should be subject to its being ascertained that there was no one in the country already jwho could do the work.    This measure was badly drafted, it was fiver introduced, and it was referred back by the late Secretary i State for revision, the Governor being asked at the same time ;o give statistics of the immigration and emigration of various aces in 1923. The Franchise Bill was passed, but the Indians have ot t,aken advantage of it by registering as voters.    They have 3.ded on non-co-operation and have refused to pay taxes. Some of 11 have in consequence been summoned under the provisions of the j and some, in default of payment, have been sent to prison,,Early next month I expect from India the Committee l0fl5 under the formula agreed upon at the Imperial Conference, to consult with the Secretary of State on matters affecting!i Indians
Indians iti other Colonies and, as regards Kenya, is to make representations.tChe questions for consideration by the Cabinet appearto befij   Was Colonel WedgwoodBs statement a formal pledge bn behalf of the Labour party ? On this point I have no special information.fiij   Was it a pledge binding a Labour Government to take action in circumstances which could not be foreseen at the time, namely,, holding office without a majority in the House of Commons ?(iii)   Does it bind us to take, without the most careful consideration of the whole question, and without full reference to the Governor, who is responsible for carrying out what is decided, action in the direction of reversing the White Paper policy, so as to make It more acceptable to the Indians and less aoceptable to the Europeans?   Was it not rather a general pledge to establish justice and fair-play, it being understood that we do not regard the White Paper as the last word on the subject ?(iv)   Is the obligation to fulfil the pledge made more Immediate by the present non-co-operation of the Indians in Kenya ?   In the case of India itself, the Prime Minister has deprecated such action,   I have already quoted what Colonel Wedgwood said on this point in the case of Kenya.t and I am glad to see that Lord Olivier has taken the same line.On the general question, I may perhaps quote from aletter written by Lord Olivier to the Seoretary of the indians Overseas Association:-&quot; Constitutional changes having been accepted, itis quite impossible and entirely contrary to thewhole methods and traditions of British    constitutional development towards free and equalinstitutions immediately to reverse and upsetarrangements which have been made, not for thepurpose of establishing an ideal form of democraticconstitution, but for the essential purpose ofGovernment, namely, of carrying on the businessof Government in the interests of the greatesthappiness and. the greatest possible freedom of thegreatest number&quot;.
I am convinced that at this stage the only possible attitude is that indicated&apos; In my public statement, that, as at present advised, I should be g,uided by the White Paper decisions.   For the moment, my intention has been to suspend judgment until I have heard the Committee from India, and then to take up the matter with the Governor as may be necessary after considering the Committee&apos;^ representations,   is to immigration, It is possible that the figures which the Governor is to send will show that no present action is required to restrict immigration.   In the meantime, I am looking into the question how far the economic interests of the natives require that tho power of control should exist; if I am satisfied on that pointy I consider that the power should be taken and held in reserve if it Is not wanted at once.As regards the franchise, it should be given a chance&apos;r/&apos;and the fact that the Indians have not, so far, accepted It should not be regarded as proving that It is impossible.  &apos;&apos;:&apos;-&apos;;,- - .  : (Int&amp;, )   J.L.1&apos;.,Colonial Office.
