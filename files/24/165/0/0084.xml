OLD AGE PENSIONS.

Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

1. I wish to place before my colleagues proposals for amending tho existing scheme of Old Age Pensions. As they are aware, an insistent demand has been raised in many quarters during recent years that the means qualification should be abolished and that generally speaking, everyone should become entitled to a pension of 10s. a week at the age of 70. It is not however my intention to discuss the merits of this suggestion as its cost is in present circumstances prohibitive.

2. Under the existing law the means qualification is approximately as follows:-

Weekly
r-----      -   ---- l ?/eokly rato of ponaion por peraon	, Weakly means				31nglo person (personal mean a)		Married Couple (joint mean a of oouplo)		Sxceedihg	Hot Ex-coed ing	Bxceeding	Hot $ Seedinga,  a. 10    0	a. a.	a.   a. 10.   0	3. a.	a. a. 20. 08     0	10   0	12    0	20   0	24   0!    6  0 life	12   0	14    0	24   0	28   04&apos; 0	14   0	16     0	28   0	32   02   0	16   0	18     0	32   0	36   01   0	18   0	19     0	36   0	38   0Mil	19   0		38   0	-3.    Old A,&quot;) Pensions on the above baaia are estimated to coat over  24 million in the coming finanoial year 1924/25. I am a-viaod by the Government Actuary that this figure is likely to riao to  27 million in 1930,  35 million in 1940 ,uitl  40 million in 1945.    This striking ijpcreaao in cost in future yoar3 ia due to increased longevity and to the rapidly inoroaaing number of birtha two gonerationa ago.     Tho aholi-tion of the mean a qualification would, it ia estimated., add  1G million a year to present coat in a very ahort time and this figure would probably mount to  20 million in 1930,  25 million in 1940 ana  29 million in 1945 - the30 figures being in addition to tho coat of the existing scheme as atated at tho beginning of thia paragraph.     I am olear that theae figuroa rule out from immodiato consideration tho abolition of the moans limit and -that any proposals for amending the existing schemo mxist be cast on auch more modest linos.,
4.     Tho demand for abolition of a moans qualification : has cobs in the main from the strong feeling that persona ought not to be deprived of a State pension in old age because they have been thrifty.    In the first placo4 therefore, I concentrated upon this aspect of the question.!5.    Some would-he reformers of the Old A^o Potion Scheme have suggested that It would bo poasiblo to dis-criminate between means resulting from various kinds of thrift and to eliminate oertain kinds in calculating means.    Thus some have- ascribed a greater  measure of virtue to what they describe as the nooDjnunal* thrift of persons who contribute to the benefit funds of Tra^ie Unions and Friendly Societies than to the &quot;self ia,hn thrift of persons who invest their savings in property of one kind and another.    But after careful examination I am convinced that no distinction oan be drawn exoept of a most artifioial kind and that it is necessary to make a concession covering all kinds of thrift.6*-   The next question is whether it is administra-tively possible to isolate means resulting from thrift &apos; of whatever kind and make somo relaxation in tho provis-ions governing their calculation^    &amp;:do.a lag earnings and benevolence, means are mado up of -(a) payments by way of benefit from Tirade Unions and Friendly 3ocictios;(b) payments from Superannuation FiJtfs to which the payees have contributed;Co) income or its equivalent from property; and(d) life interests and annuities.
7. No difficulty would arise as regards (a) in applying the thrift test as these payments are provided out of the past contributions of the members.  But this is not so with the other three categories. Superannuation Funds are nearly always fed by contributions of the employers as well as of the employed. Property may represent savings or gifts or bequests. Annuities may have been purchased by the recipient or may represent a gift or bequest. This means falling within the last three categories may all be derived in whole or part from non-thrift sources and if any attempt were made to apply a thrift test to such items, the Pension Officer would be force to institute enquiries into the past history of the means. But it will be appreciated that the Pension Officer would be unable in the bulk of cases to analyse means by a test not related to their obvious character at the time of investigation, and that any scheme which involved such research would involve enquiries of an inquisitorial kind, which the public would not tolerate.

8. In these circumstances I have been forced to the conclusion that it is impossible to devise any workable method of discriminating satisfactorily between thrift and benevolence. The exclusion of all means derived from both sources would involve a greater expenditure than can at present be provided. I suggest, therefore, that the existing basis of calculation of means should be continued with the proviso that means resulting from thrift or benevolence, or, in other words, all means apart from earnings, should be excluded from calculation
calculation in bo far as they do not exceed a certain amount.      Under this proposal an applicant for a pen-sion wouldbe placed in a more advantageous position than at present except so far as he was a wage-earner. I think that it would be wrong to do anything which might act as an encouragement to wage-earning over 70.9.   lTo information is available upon which an estimate of any value could be framed as to the number of persons who Would come within the pension -scheme for the first time if Buch a proposal were adopted.   It is therefore necessary under existing financial conditions to proceed cautiously.    My proposal is that in arriving at the means shown in paragraph 2 all means resulting from thrift and benevolence should be excluded in so fariae they do not exceed 10/- a week in the case of a sin-gle person and  1 a week in the case of married couples, It is estimated that the cost would be about  3 millions a year in the first instance and it would rapidly increase for the* reaaons given in paragraph 3.10.   The attached Fote illustrates the effect of these proposals in certain typical cases.     These examples show very clearly the advantage which is conferred upon aged persons and aged couples inespecial over those whose means consist of earnings.   But as I have said above I do not think that we should with unemployment as it is encourage wage-earning over 70 and anyhow the problem we have set ourselves to solve is to deal with the discouragement of thrift involved in the present means qualification.     My proposal will, I submit, succeed in removing any legitimate grievance which may exist on this score,P.S.TREASURY, S,W.
