The Pensions (Increase) Bill, with a covering Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, 23rd October 1923 (CP, 424(23)),The Chairman explained that the Draft Bill had beenprepared by the late Government and -provided for certainadditions being: made in the case of pensions not exceeding 100 per annum to the percentage increases granted by thePensions (Increase) Act, 1920,     The Bill was confined tothis one definite object and did not embrace general
proposals for amending or extending the Act which hadbeen suggested in various quarters.    The more important of these proposals wore -(l)   The removal of the &quot;private means&quot; restrictions;(Z)   The abolition of tho condition that a pensioner must reside within the British Islands;(3)   The alteration of Clause 3 of the Act of 1920 so as to compel local authorities to !?ive the increased benefits to their own ponsioners.The Committee fully discussed the question of including any or all of these proposals in the&apos; Draft Bill,As the Bill is draf?ri no amendments except amendmentsvarying the percentages would be within the sc*pe of thoBill;&apos; any other amendments would bo out of order.The Committee recognisedthat to open the door to etheramendments would endanger the parsing of the Bill andthat it was better to make certain of securing the per-centapo additions provided in the Bill than to attempt tocarry proposals,, desirable in themselves but controversial and costly.The Civil Lord of the Admiralty dissented from this view and desired that the scope of the Bill ahopId be widened to include the proposals set out above.The Committee recommend the Cabinet -To approve the introduction of the Pensions (increase)Billfin the form attached, and would impress upon the Cabinet the importance of passing the Bill into &apos;.   law during this Session.Mr. Hodges asked that his dissent should be recorded.Signed on behalf of the Committee J.
