(&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1924.SECRET.cp. 151 (24).I a -j c jNext move in Indian affairs.Telegram from Motilal Nehru, Bombay, to Colonel Wedgwood, House of Commons,dated 22nd February 1924.&quot; My resolution asking for round table conference represents result of my best endeavour to unite all shades of Indian Nationalist opinion on minimum demand. We are offering you frankly this opportunity of meeting national demand of India presented in most acceptable form. Hope England will not disappoint us and will save India from bitter discontent and misunderstanding.&quot;This is one way of putting it. The other, which would more closely correspond with the facts, would be to substitute the word &quot; maximum &quot; for &quot; minimum,&quot; for Nehru had to come back from the demand of the Swaraj Party, formulated in their own resolution by liangachariar, in order to find something he could screw the Moderates up to asking for, viz., not a demand for &quot;immediate full responsible self-government,&quot; but a demand for a &quot;round table conference &quot; to frame a scheme to the endorsement of which no Moderate, nervous about public odium, needed to feel that he was committing himself. The message is an ingeniously worded bluff, but should be treated as a friendly overture.Our chief cause of difficulty is that we have to deal with a Home Rule movement with which we are in sympathy, voiced by a comparatively small educated class, and in some cases very able men, whose protagonists, since the death of Mr. Gokhale, follow methods which, on. the face of them, make it impossible to regard them as responsible and reliable statesmen.This is, of course, almost necessarily the case in some degree with all nationalist movements. They must be led. To rouse them the leaders must inflame feeling. The feeling most suitable and easy to excite is hatred of the foreign rule, an emotion glorified in all copy-books. To excite hatred he must be allowed no natural virtue or merit acquired by action, and have imputed to him all the qualities of a fiend. This is noexaggeration of what is being done in India. It is a feature familiar in all political and social struggles. The English in India, notwithstanding what they have done and can alone continue to do for the country, have themselves, by their own character-istic limitations and those of their women, largely provoked a good deal of the hatred and condemnation that are fomented against them. The cleavage was bound to grow as the education and Westernisation of modern India grew. The growing divergence was noted by G. W. Steevens at the end of the last century, and it appears to me to have widened considerably since.So able a man as Mr. Brailsford in last week&apos;s New Leader writes of &quot;India&quot; and an &quot; adult India &quot; as making the demands formulated by the Swaraj party leaders, a metaphor absurd in any sense except for a section of the small educated modernised class, who think in terms of Western politics. They are, of course, the only people who can make that demand and they make it as a means to a natural end which they share with the moderate reformers. If its real backing were more substantial and coherent than it actually is, the position would be more hopeful than in a critique of real politics it can be regarded as being. &apos;The Mohammedans united with the Brahmins and the Liberals generally to get us out, are not sincere in that alliance. They are neither Brahmins nor Liberals. They know clearly and do not always disguise what they want. The Brahmins are not and cannot be sincere in their profession of democracy for India. Gandhi is sincere and consistent, but what Gandhi himself wants would mean a reversion to the oriental system of peasantry, such as the English found in India, with Governments of the character we substituted. I submit that the most important declaration of the position in the recent situation and that which gives the best indication of the lines on which we ought to start the next move, is the following passage in the election manifesto of the Swaraj party, over the signature of Mr. Motilal Nehru, in which the basis of that programme is set forth.7143     100 &apos;3.24
9 $ ao y-examined the possibility of re-opening-the questions of the uniform soale of pay for urban and rural Forces and the terms . on which new recruits might be obtained.8 UNIFORM 4,     On the one hand it may be pointed out that there isjiliB.considerable opposition on the part of many rural Local Authorities to the uniform scale of pay which imposes&apos;so heavy a burden on the rates.   Moreover, the uniform scale\ has the effect of remunerating the rural policeman at a. rate considerably in excess of those wiling in most Other employments in his locality and this in turn reacts on the remuneration of other Local Authority employees.   On the other hand emphasis is laid on the desirability of maintaining the policy of standardisation to which the Desborough Committee attached the greatest importance, in which many Local, Authorities acquiesce and which has been affirmed by successive Administrations.   It is represented that on merits a uniform scale can be justified on the grounds that the duties of the rural policeman are more varied, his responsibilities greater and his hours often longer than those of the urban policeman. Having regard.to the faot that the great majority of the police are stationed in. urban areas the saving to the Exchequer by the adoption of differential scales would be inconsiderable,,. .u3 FOR     5.     It is urged that new recruits might on the merits be paid RECRUITS.a substantially lower initial rate than that now in force. On the other hand the adoption of a 60/- minimum for recruits, as against 70/- at present, would only give a maximum saving . over the whole country of  200,000 per annum of which  100,000 per annum would accrue to. the Exchequer:   the      . polioy would be subjected to considerable political criticism and would be represented as an attempt by the Government to re-open the whole Lesborough settlement.-a-
&quot; The Swarajya Party believes that the guiding motive of the British in governing India is to serve the selfish interests of their own country, and that the so-called reforms are a mere blind to further the said interest under the pretence of granting responsible government to India, the real object being to continue the exploitation of the unlimited resources of the country by keeping Indians permanently in a sub-sei vient position to Britain and denying them at home and abroad the most elementary rights of citizen-ship. It is daily becoming abundantly clear that the British, while professing equality of treatment, are in practice subjecting the whole Indian nation to humiliation and insult in all parts of the world where British influence is supreme. The. Party notes with pride and satisfaction that the people of India are resolved to submit no longer to the national humiliation imposed upon them by the autocratic will of their British rulers, and in full consonance with the Congress expresses its emphatic opinion that Indians have no option but to continue to carry on a policy of progressive non-violent non-co-operation with the present system of government until it is radically changed, in accordance with the will of the people expressed through their chosen representatives.&quot;   ;a,.  ,The practical programme,of the Party&quot;was then thus laid down :&quot;The demand to be made by the member,- of the Party on entering the Legislative Assembly will in effect be that the right of the people of India to control&apos;, the existing machinery and system of govern-:rhent shall forthwith be conceded and given effect to by the British Government and the British Parliament.&quot; The immediate objective of the Party is the speedy attainment of full Dominion status; that is, the securing of the right to frame a Constitution adopting such machinery and system as are most suited to the conditions of the country and to the genius of the people.&quot; They will, when they are elected, present on behalf of the country its legitimate demands as formulated by the Party as soon as the elections are over, and ask for their acceptance and fulfilment within a reasonable time by the Government.&quot;If the demands are not granted to the satisfaction of the Party, occasion will then arise for the elected members belonging to the Party to adopt a policy of uniform, continuous and consistent obstruction within the Councils with a view to make government, through the Councils, impossible, but before adopting such a policy the representatives of the Party in the Councils will, if necessary, strengthen themselves by obtaining an express mandate of the electorates in this behalf.0 * * iS S- -*-&quot; In no case will any member of the Party accept office.&quot;Anyone who, with access to British opinion, could really believe that statement would obviously not have enough civic intelligence to be capable of running a parish council. It is formulated as the kind of appeal most likely to provoke a fighting spirit, and to return the Swaraj Party candidates. This it has done, as Lord Reading and other Indian Governors in private letters explain to me, largely because no sort of:- counter case or counter statement is or can be presented to the electors on behalf oi the Government. The Moderates have no such hot stuff to appeal to, and their election campaigns appear to have been exceedingly feeble and ill-organised. It is natural to every patriotic voter to want Home Rule, and to prefer the candidate who promises him to.get it most quickly..- It appears to me to be of little use to send out (as Mr. Montagu was sent out) an Under Secretary of-State or other emissary to India, to try to diagnose the facts of the situation, which so far as they are obscure-as they do not seem to me to be the Viceroy and. the Government can collect for us more effectually so far as their side of them goes. As regards the other side of them, having regard to the vastness of India and the? limiting conditions of time, space and intelligence, it seems to be impossible that such an emissary could either disclose to us any new point of view in the Home Rule, party, or effect anything by persuasion with such a vast and not very coherent junta of astute politicians.But I look at the matter like this: Here is a considered pronouncement by a political party. That political party is returned in considerable force in sufficient force to carry the resolution of its leader in the Legislative Assembly.This is an impugnment both of the good faith of the British Government and of the established constitution as a Workable machine for the purpose of good administration.I want, and I should like to be aide to do it in the name of the King&apos;s Government, to take notice of this manifesto and of the resolution based upon, it, and to. invite the leading representatives of this party, the leaders of parties who have voted with them and representatives of non-enfranchised classes, 10 come over here, where, the Parliament sits which has to decide upon their case, and to let Parliament, our party, and the public hear their case argued, against the sincerity of our intention in the Montagu-Chelmsfordreforms, and their complaints, against the reforms as an effectual- instrument of their intended purpose.
I suggest that this might be done by setting up either a Royal Commission, suitably constituted to hear the representations and the counter case of the Government of India, or the setting up of a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament, for that -purpose.The Court which the Swarajists have to convince is over here. I do not suppose they will relish the invitation, because such an enquiry would most uncomfortably -knock the stuffing but of a great deal of their case and entirely deprive them of much of the encouragement which they still receive from members of our own party, who are misled by the sort of trash that is fed to the Daily Herald. I would very much like to inform our&apos;1 owrh party of the true facts of the case, and the considerations to be borne in mind.I suggest that this proposal offers a basis for discussion of the next possible step in this matter, and that a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet should be appointed to consider it as ^promptly as possible.3rd March 1924.OLIVIER.
