frpi-TTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT) -(SECS^T) CAB I N E T*CP. I3l [U\ BRITITH CONCESSIONS IN CHINA.9 ft 9&apos;-j &apos;0 oQuestion of Renewal of Leases. Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.A difference of opinion has arisen between the Foreign Office and my Department In regard to the renewal of leases to lot-holders of British Concessions in China and I submit the following statement for the consideration of the Cabinet.   It follows the lines of the statement submitted by my predecessor on^the 20th July, 1925, but has been amplified in order to deal with the points raised in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the 14th February, 1924.(1) Origin of the Concession Leases.These seven Concession Areas were granted by the Chinese Government between 1851 and 1861, that British subjects might form trading communities.   The land wa3 purchased   by H.M. Government, the existing Chinese owners receiving the price, and is held by H.M. Government in perpetuity, in accordance with the ordinary arrangements governing the tenure of land in China, l.e., land tax is paid by HoM. Government just as it is paid by any other holder of land.   The Concessions are, therefore, ordinary perpetual leases.The Concession lots were sold by auction by H.M. Government to British traders, under 99 year leases, with a nominal ground rent.   The original holders, therefore,, bought a leasehold interest at leasehold prices and whenever they
they disposed, of their interest, they did so at the then market value of the remainder of their interest.i-j xi uThe Crown Advocate advises that at the expiration of the 99 year leases, the buildings erected revert to H*M. Government as landlords.,(2) The quest.on of Renewals?arose out of an application ms.de in 1909 by the Chartered Bank of Tientsin, who asked what terms the Government would require for renewal.   A Committee, appointed by the Treasury., advised that renewals should be granted for a further 99 years for a consideration (annual rental) based on the value of the land and property at the time of renewal.   Owing to various objections by Foreign Office representatives and lot-holders, the Committee was reconstituted, and the majority reported that there was no objection to a term of 999 years instead of 99 years.   As to the annual rent, a concession might be made on grounds of policy by reducing the factor of buildings.   The method was to be one of loading the land values, in respect of existing or possible buildings, by fixod and moderate amounts.   In the result, the Treasury decided (with some hesitation, as they thought the proposals too favourable to the lot-holders) to take as the basis of the annual sum, the market value of the site, loaded by the addition of a sum based on only one half of the value of the buildings.3.) The Opposition to^theScheme.The proposals were explained to the lot-holders, and have generally met with acceptance.   The opposition centres round a small but active minority of lot-holders at Tientsin, whose opposition was prompted by certain events connected with local politics, the nature of which *I
I will explain in a later paragraph..   1 proceed, -to-detall! and answer a few of the arguments put forward by the opposing lot-holders:- W-&apos;J(i) They have asked for a renewal of their leases&quot;&apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;on purely nominal terms.   But the lot-holders have bought a leasehold interestj if they want practical freehold they should pay freehold price.   If,on the other hand,their contention is admitted and their loases renewed for 999 years on nominal terms, the individual lot-holders (who are generally large commercial firms) will automatically acquire aa a gift an interest capable of being exploited immediately for very substantial capital sums.   As it is, they are offered 999 years at less than the market price.(ii) The opposing lot-holders claim that there was nooriginal intention to make a profit out of the Concessions.   This is disproved by the fact that the lots were sold originally by auction to the highest bidders, and the Treasury archives show clearly that the Government made tho best bargains possible, (iii)   They claim that the success and value of the concessions are due to their efforts.   But like all other British subjects domiciled abroad they pay no contribution to the Exchequer and enjoy the care of the Government for their general interests.(iv)   They claim that they are being treated worse than the nationals of other Concessions, whose Governments have given freehold tenure.   3Jut although it is not definitely known that in the foreign Concessions, the lots were given by theGovernments
Governments to their-nationals -without charge, the fact is clear that lots in those Concessions&apos; can only be obtained at freehold prices and JM 1 that the present holders must have paid such a price.   In the British Concessions, the. lot-holders have paid leasehold prices, and the present holders have acquired thorn from other lot-holders at leasehold prices.   They can get freehold at less than freehold price; to this s- extent their position is better than that of holders in the other Concessions.Ill(4) The Question of Policy raised in the Foreign Office Memorandum.I now turn to the Foreign Office Memorandum of the 14-th February and at the risk of repeating what i have said already, I feel that it is necessary to comment on certain points which do not appear to me to convey ah adequate idea of the real facts.   The Foreign Office memorandum does not make it clear that H.M. Government bought the land from the Chinese owners, and sold a   99 years lease of each lot to the highest bidder.   The ground rent does not always bear a relation to the amount of the Chinese land tax, e.g. at Hankow the ground rents are more than five times the amount of the land tax.   It is perfectly clear that what the lot-holders bought was a leasehold interest and that there is no justification for giving them practical perpetuity for nothing.On the question of ex-territoriallty and the question of policy arising therefrom, I can only say that I do not see how the leases are related to ex-territorial privileges.   Municipal and Consular Jurisdictions are, of course, extra-territorial privileges, but the Government leases of the concession areas are not different in character from their leases of Consular sites and compounds, and fromall
all other foreign holdings.   The land is held in the same way as land generally in China, and the Chinese Government lias never regarded traffic in these holdings as an exploitation.   It seems clear that the Chineso Government knows and recognises the existing lease system as an affair of ordinary business and not of policy.The principle- of ex-territoriallty may be in jeopardy, as the Foreign Office say, but nothing definite is adduced to show that the position could be made more insecure if the present proposals are adopted or less insecure if in the alternative a free gift is made to the existing lot-holders of a 999 years lease.   As regards the argument that H.M, Government is attempting&apos;to exploit for the benefit of the Exchequer an ex-territorial privilege in a way in which no other Power has attempted it, this consideration in not relevant, as in the other concessions the lot-holders hold in perpetuity by payment of the Chinese Government Land Tax and the conditions are quite different.   What.exploitation there is, is done.by the lot-holders, and the lots change hands, on a freehold basis. The Governments are therefore, not in a position to reap any. financial advantage as landlords.   I would further point out that the remission of the share of the Boxer Indemnity.is.also.an irrelevant consideration, as it is a remission.to the Chinese people, whereas a remission of the payment for the renewal of the. leases would not affect the Chinese but would go directly.to the benefit of tho pocketB.of the,lot-holderswhich is quite a different-proposition. ..      VlThe argument that the Government Scheme for renewals will cause trouble.with China and other Powers is easily answered by the fact that during the last twelve years, although the scheme has been widely advertised, ho contention or complaint has ever emerged&apos; and there isno
&apos;-j j  ano sign that it will emerge in the future.   Tlie Chinese Government institutions are established in the Concessions where they acquire lots like other holders, and. they are quite ready to enter in the Government scheme without raising any question.   As regards the nationals of other Powers, the same remarks hold good.   At Tientsin, the managers of the Belgian Bank and of the Russian Bank, at Canton, the representative of a leading American Bank, which holds lots in the Concession, have expressed their views that the scheme is reasonable.   The fact that applications for renewals have already been received from American, Japanese and French Firms shows that there is no need to anticipate any objections from other Powers.   These firms can obtain under the Government scheme practical perpetuity for less than the market price in the British. Concessions whereas in the Foreign Concessions they would have to pay the full perpetuity price; they therefore have our advantage over their fellow nationals in the non-British Concessions. In his letter Sir J. Jordan states that &quot;our people obtain perpetual leases in the concessions of all other powers in China, subject to payment of Chinese ground rent&quot;, but he omits to state that they have to buy the lots from the present holders at freehold prioeB, and that foreigners buying lots in British Concessions will likewise do so at the market prices of a 999 years lease,fill). The real nature of the Opposition to the Government Scheme.The whole argument on the ground of policy on which the Foreign Office stake their case, has been raised at a very late stage in the consideration of a scheme extending over a period of IS years.   I feel bound to attempt to put that arguemnt in its proper perspective by explaining the nature of the local opposition which has led to the final attempt to shelve the Government scheme,i! The
The Municipal Area at Tientsin is divided, into two parts, the Concession proper, and the Municipal extension.   The price which the land-renters of the Concession exacted for allowing the municipal extension to amalgamate with the Concession was the creation of a &quot;Crown lessees reimbursement fund&quot;, under which the land-renters would be reimbursed at the expense of the rate-payers up to what was estimated to be the additional amount which they would have to pay under the Government scheme.   The Consul-General at the time gave the lot-holders to understand that the amount at which the fund was fixed represented in the view of the Consular Authorities arid of H.M, Minister at Peking &quot;the maximum terms which can fairly be demanded by the Crown for the renewals of the Crown leasos&quot;.   He had of course no authority to make such a statement, but he cautiously added &quot;if the cost of the renewal turns out to be more than is anticipated, the lease-holder has to pay the balance himself&quot;.     When the renewal terms became definitely known, they were found to exceed the amount provided by the fund, and the lot-holders (who are only 40 in number) attempted to persuade the rate-payers to Increase the fund accordingly.   The assumption Is that if they had succeeded, they would have accepted the Government Scheme, but their proposal of course provoked a storm.   On the one  Ihand it was said that the ratepapers were easily able to bear the burden: on the other hand it was pointed out that it was quite unjust to saddle the whole of the ratepayers with tho cost of the renewal of Lots and present it a3 a free gift to 40 lot-holders.   The result was a compromise; it was decided t6 send the deputation to London and, with the support of the Foreign Office to attempt to get^the Government Scheme set aside.   As the Chairman of the Municipal Council said &quot;we have a sporting chance of getting away without paying anything at all11.   This then is thenature
91 ^Hi jl.nature of tho opposition; it centres round a small group of wealthy lot-holders and has its roots in an affair of local politics, in which, the Consul General was partially concerned,   Ho doubt it would conduce to easy and pleasant relations if li.ll. Government were to sacrifice their undoubted rights and agree to set aside their present more than generous proposals in favour of a free gift of  40,000 a year to a wealthy oligarchy which makes no contribution to the British Exchequer.   But, if this is done, the values of lots will rise still more, and the present holders will be able to exploit their possession of valuable properties which they will be able to,dispose of for vast profits.   As it is, the lots change hands on their present basis for large sums and no suggestion is made that this is exploitation on which the Chinese Government might look with an unfavourable eye.   The fact is that, over the Concessions as a whole the holders of 84 per cent of.the lots (including two principal British Banks, the British-American Tobacco Company, the Asiatic Petroleum Company, and the Standard Oil Company) have expressed their agreement with the Government scheme; the holders of 29-1 per cent are merely waiting and will come in finally; while the known opposition to the scheme comes from the holders of only. 6-g- per cent of the lots.   These figures speak for themselves.   Is H.M. Government to be deprived of what it is, on all grounds, entitled to, simply because it is easier to give in to a small and active local opposition than to take a firm stand on a fully considered and reasonable scheme for the renewal of the leases?Silihe Value  of the OonoaaM-iniiM.I feel bound to make some remarks in conclusion, on this point, as tko observations made in the Foreign Office memorandum may convey a false impression, Mr. Simpson, the Office of Works Surveyor and Valuer, whohas
has an unrivalled knowledge of the Concession properties,and great experience as a valuer, has valued the whole ofthe Concessions at to-day&apos;s market value, at  6,000,000,made up as follows91 ^Land  2,500,000Buildings (full value)  5,500,000   &apos;Total  6,000,000For the purpose of calculating the annual rental, no allowance has been made for increment in values between the present time and 19S0, the date of the expiration of the existing leases, but it has been assumed that the value of the lots in I960 will be the same as the market value to-day, plus a small amount in respect of buildings which will be erected before 1960 on lots at present not built on.   This is:, of course, a generous concession to the lot-holdersc   A rent of  58,000 accumulated until 19 30 at dfa would yield just over  6,000,000, but instead of exacting  58,000, the Treasury have agreed to make a reduction in respect of half the value of the buildings and so sacrifice  18,000 per annum.   The annual charge, therefore, stands at  40,000 per annum, and, as this sum at 5$ would produce by 1960 a figure of  4,300,000, the capital sacrifice by the Government is about, 1,700,000, without taking&apos;account of a future increase in values.   On this last point, I may mention that Mr. Simpson&apos;s view, having regard to the trend of values in China during the past decade, is that it i3 reasonable to assume that the market value of the lots in 1960 will not be  6,000,000, but from  15,000,000 to  20,000,000, a figure which would justify a rent of  160,000 or  170,000 instead of  40,000.   The Foreign Office suggest that Mr. Simpson&apos;s valuation is too higly but gives no reasons.    It has come to my notice that at Hankow, in December, 1922, the Municipal Council purchasedthe
the remainder of the l&amp;aae of a portion of a Concession lot at a price bjaed on Mr, Simpson&apos;s valuation.   I cannot do better than quote the following remarks of the Land Commissioners (who were three in number and represented the Lot-holders, the Ratepayers and the Council respectively) as published in the Hankow Municipal Gazette December 1922.&quot;HoM. Office of Works having recently sent out Mr, Simpson and entrusted him with the work of obtaining data relative to present day values of Concession lots for purposes of renewal of Crown Leases and his exhaustive enquiry having resulted in establishing Land Value in the British Concession generally acceptable to lot holders, the Commissioners are of opinion that Mr. Simpson&apos;s values should be applied&quot;.   This evidence hardly needs further comment.Having regard to all the circumstances I have no hesitation in asking that the Governments Scheme be upheld and that I may have authority at once to accept the numerous applications for renewals with which my Department have been unabla to deal, to the serious detriment of the lot-holders concerned.   The opposing lot-holders will not be compelled to come into tlie scheme, they can hold on under present conditions, if they prefer to do so, for there is no element of compulsion in the scheme.
