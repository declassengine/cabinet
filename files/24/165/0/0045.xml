DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)/ 7RET / O  9 *l *,---        - CABINET *; ^USA (24).------UNEMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE.SECOND INTERIM REPORT ON UNEMPLOYMENT.Supplementary Note on theTraining ana Employment of Women.With reforenoe to paragraph 11 (s) of their Second Interim Report to the Cabinet on Unemployment, the Unemploy-ment Committee suggest- that specific reference should be made in the proposed statement in Parliament to the more reoent endeavours of the Government to provide for the training and employment of women.   The present position of this question is accordingly set out in the following paragraphs.Relief work oan do very little directly to provide employment for women,   Almost the only form of relief which is practicable is.training, and even there the difficulty is to discover any calling for. which women can be trained, with a prospect of obtaining employment.The training of unemployed women i3 oarried out through the Central Committee on Women1s^Training and Employment, and has been financed partly from their own funds (which are now noaring exhaustion), and partly by Government contributions on a proportionate basis, the total of which, paid or promised, amounts to  150,000,   Till the Government took office, this oontribution was given only   in respect of the &quot;Home-craft&quot; Classes, admission to whiah was limited to unemployed women who would undertake to enter resident domestic service. This limitation has been removed, so that aid is now being given to what are now called Home Training Classes, entrants
:j tj "to  which are not required to give this undertakings   This will.make it easier to establish classes and it is believed that the effect will bo not to diminish but to increase tho number of unemployed woman who are diverted to domestic serviceoThe Central Committee&apos;&apos;s scheme for supplying domestic outfits to unemployed women capable Of ontaring domestic service direct but prevented by lack of clothes, is also now being aided.,Tho Committee have beon asked to explore tho possibility-lity of starting courses of training for other occupations. Tho Employment Department are also making these enquiries. Eho question is whether there are trades in whioh thore is a demand for skilled women whom it is practicable to train outside tho factories.    It has beon suggested that in trades such as tho clothing trade in which there is likely to be in tho future a demand for skilled women, an idle factory should be taken over and used as a training centre. This experiment was, however, tried in 1919/SO by the Ministry of Labour and was not found satisfactory.   Tho great difficulties wore the enormous amount of material which was consumed and the disposal of the products. Equally it is undesirable to start courses of training unless there is a definite prospect of the absorption of the women at the end of tho course.   It is, however, possible that there may be openings for giving women who havo experience of one small section of the trade training in other sections which would increase their utility. Something on these lines has already been done by the, Central Committee in assisting unemployed typists and clerical workers to improve their qualifications, in order to help them to fill the openings which do exist in the higher   branches of their calling.
In conjunction with the Board of&apos; Education, enquiries are being made as to whether there is any vacant accommodation and equipment in Technical Schools which could be utilised for the training of unemployed, women if openings for them can be found.E,B0 HOWORTH )Signod on behalf of the CommitteeJointCW.Cc, EABY    ) Secretaries,SIHIEY WEBB,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.&apos;W.lv,4th March, 1924--3-
