THIS HOCUMjNT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HTS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S. GOYEW(MliIflT,,v cabinet.0RgTt .      NECESSITOUS   AREAS, COPY No.1 3 ...MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.I saw on the 25th instant a deputation on the subject of assistance by way of grants from State funds to local authorities in areas where heavy burdens are thrown on the local rates by reason of the continued unemployment (the so-called necessitous areas).The deputation was introduced by Mr. Will Thorns, and Mr. Trevelyan Thomson also spoke.     Representatives of 23 Boards of Guardians and 22 Boroughs and Urban Districts were present, including the Board of Guardians of Barrow, Birmingham, Newcaatle-on-Tyne, Sheffield, Coventry, Edmonton among others, and the Councils of Burnley, Middlesbrough, South Shields, Strike-on-Trent, Swansea, West Bromwidh, West Ham among others.The deputation urged that a grant should be made from State funds to necessitous Poor Law authorities in accordance with what may be called the East Ham formula, which is as follows(1) To the Guardians of each Poor Law area in which &quot;the average number of persons relieved during the year&quot; is in excess of &quot;the number appropriate to the area&quot; there shall (subject to the limitations herein provided) be paid a grant as follows(2) In respect of every excess case relieved 75% of either of the following amounts, whichever is the less;-(a) &quot;The average expenditure per person relieved&quot; in the Union area;   or(b) &quot;The average expenditure per person relieved&quot; * in England and Wales,(3) Provided that:-(a) In no case shall the amount of..grant exceed 50fj of the &quot;net expenditure&quot; of the Poor Law Authority during the year;&apos;   and(b) If the grant as calculated is of an amount which would reduce the &quot;Local Rate&quot; to an amount lower-1-
f) c) Otryan the &quot;Standard Rate&quot; the grant shall be reduced so that the &quot;Local Rate&quot; is equal to the &quot;Standard Rate&quot;;   and(c) No grant shall be payable to the Poor Law Authority of any area In which the &quot;Local Rate11 is lower than the &quot;Standard Rate&quot;.Definitions.(4) For the purposes of this Scheme tho following definitions shall be applicable:-(a) &quot;The average number of persons relieved during the year&quot; shall be the average of the four quarterly returns of the Ministry of Health, issued daring the year ending the 31st March,(b) &quot;The number appropriate to the area&quot; shall be calculated as follows:-Average Ho. of Persons relieved Populationduring the year per 1,000 of of Unionpopulation in England and Wales. Area,--1----:- x &quot;TTooo     ,(c) &quot;Net expenditure&quot; shall be the net expenditure charged to &quot;Common Fund&quot; as apportioned amsmgat the Parishes during the year, less grants received under the Agricultural Rates Act, 1396c(d) &quot;The average expenditure per person relieved&quot; .shall be the net expenditure divided by the average number of persons relieved during the year.(e) &quot;The Local Rate&quot; shall be based on net exoenditure for the year and R.V. of the area as at 1st April.(f) &quot;The Standard Rate&quot; shall be the average rate in the   required for Poor&apos; Law purposes for the year based on the total Rateable Value&apos;- of . England and Wales and the total net expenditure in the same year, excluding any grant received under these regulations,I informed the- deputation that I would consider thequestion and take the views of the Cabinet on it as soon aspossible,I may begin by observing that the request for a free grant in accordance with the formula was submitted to  * Mr. Neville Chamberlain when Minister of Health, Before assuming office, he had taken part in a very large deputation which
990i W Jpreased-the- -claims of the necessitous areas on the-Oo.alrtion Government.     After careful- considerationJhe- was- unable^o-accepV-tne-formula as a suitable basis for a grant, and he recommended the late Government to refuse the grant.   In the following paragraph I summarise the grounds on which he arrived at his conclusion, premising by the observation that a grant on the East Ham formula would mean payment of a sum of rather more than  4,397.,0Q0 in a year to 61 specified unions plus the London Union areas, (This sum would probably in fact be somewhat larger because I am advised that certain other Unions would qualify for grant).The actual basis of grant under the formula was not exceptional unemployment but exceptional burdens in areas of low rateable value.   The distribution of the grant being to some extent regulated by the local rate in the pound, the formula is unfair, because the method of assessment is not uniform throughout the country.   An examination of the results of the formula as applied to various unions, shows anomalies which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to justify end which would certainly give rise to very strong complaints (e.g. Barrow would receive  8,554 and Bedwellty  3.94,889 - to tale but two instances).    It appears that the largest benefits would go to the largest spenders without much regard to economic and efficient administration,     It does not in fact seem possible to devise any method of grant to necessitous areas which is not open to.grave objection.   Such a grant must necessarily tend to sap celf reliance and sense of responsibility and inevitably must be accompanied by some measure of central control, which is extremely undesirable in the best interests of local government,,     There is no discoverable system by which it is possible to avoid allotting more by grants to inefficient or extravagant authorities than to economical and business-like bodies, whether cost or amount of relief or numbers relieved ore taken as the
basis of grant.     Thus the-tendency--of -a--grant-is., likely-to beto increase the- very evils - out of which the claim for It on theground of necessity arises.The above considerations appear to me very weightyand, so far as this particular issue, is concerned, I cannot recommend my colleagues to modify the policy of their predecessors.   This policy was that no free grants should be/ftmade, but where the strain on^Poor Law authority is shown to be too great, assistance was given by way of loan, ifnecessary d aas* of interest and w*%4? repayment^postponed for a period, before the end of which the financial position cf the authority will be further considered, and further relief afforded, if necessary, to the point even of writing off some or all of the advances, though this latter concession has been kept in the background as much as possible, in order to encourage the authority to do its best to meet its difficulties0There is, however, this further point to be remembered.      The root of the difficulties at present besetting authorities is the extent to which they have been and are being compelled to assist able-bodied persons thrown back on the Poor La*f by reason of the abnormal unemployment.     We havo maintained in the past that this particular obligation is a national obligation.      As I understand it, our own aim is, as far as possible, to meet the needs of the situation by an extended unemployment programme, and also through the medium of the Unemployment Insurance Aots, by the reduction or abolition of gap periods and other similar measures.     Such action will undoubtedly be of material assistance to the populous industrial areas from which the main pressure for a free gr^mt to the Poor Lai authorities comes and I should recommend that in ref us I the free grant, we should refer to what wo have already done and what we have in view as regards general unemployment policy and amendment of the Unemployment Insurance scheme,February, 1924
