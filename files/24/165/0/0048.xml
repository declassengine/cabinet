Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.This Bill follows upon a deputation which I received recently from the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress,   The deputation pointed out that members of a Co-operative&quot; Society which has contracts with a Town Council are disqualified from being elected or acting as Town Councillors in view of the provisions of Section 13 of the Town Councils (Scotland) Act, 1900,The law in England and Scotland on this point was the same prior to 1906 when an English Mil wa3 passed (without opposition) which enabled a person holding shares in a Society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts. 1893 and 1895 to sit as a Town Councillor without disqualification.,The deputation pressed for a similar amendment of the Scottish law.to.the fact that shareholders of Companies are not disqualified from sitting on a Town Council the case for legislation is strong -and the Bill should prove to be non-contentious,   I aak my colleagues&apos; approval to its introduction as a Government measure with a view to its passage this Session.egard to. the oo8itibn.(in England and&apos;WM.
