[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.i x)SECRET.CP. 183 (24).CABINET.TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.Proposed Loan foe Railway and Harbour Development.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE late Government, on the recommendation of the Committee on Unemployment, authorised the adoption of the following proposals for development expenditure in Tanganyika Territory: (a.) Purchase  of  a  steamer  for  use  on  Lake  Tanganyika,   estimated 1 cost  35,000.(b.) Extension of the light railway or tramway, running &quot;from a point near the port of Lindi, for about 90 miles into the interior, estimated cost  50,000.The approval of these proposals was announced by Sir Montague Barlow in his speech on the adjournment (&quot; Official Report,&quot; the 1st August, 1923, p. 1572), and he added that the financial assistance would take the form of a loan &quot; free of interest, at any rate, for a time.&quot; Sir Montague explained that proposal (b) above was strongly supported by the Empire Cotton-Growing Corporation.The total expenditure contemplated under the two proposals was, therefore,  85,000.Shortly after the change of Government I decided to consider the advisability of extending the limited authority conveyed in the decision quoted above, both in the interests of unemployment relief, of the territory, and of the extension of cotton-growing, for which the territory is a very promising field. The Governor was invited to make recommendations with approximate estimates of cost, and, although I still await a complete statement, I have received sufficient material to enable me to form an opinion as to the requirements of the situation. I am satisfied that the following works should be undertaken with as little delay as possible: 1. Railway extensions and improvements, including the Lindi scheme referredto above,  581,000. 2. Harbour and port improvements, which are urgently required,  129,000.Of the total estimated expenditure on these works ( 710,000), it is roughly calculated that  350,000 would be spent in this country on materials. I await from the Governor a statement as to the cost of certain feeder lines to the main railway of the territory, which will be most valuable to the country, especially from the point of view of opening up cotton districts, but I consider that, having regard to all the circumstances, I am justified in proposing that a sum not exceeding  1,500,000 should be granted to Tanganyika as a development loan. In view of the fact that the country is in receipt of an annual loan m-aid from the Imperial Treasury, it is essential that the loan should be free of interest or sinking charges for a time, that is to say, until financial circumstances permit the territory to assume such liabilities. The expenditure will, of course, be spread over several years.J. H. T.Colonial Office, March 14, 1924.[11384]
