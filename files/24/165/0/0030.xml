i o o-J.G6THIS DCCUlfiKl: 3g THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANHIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.CRIST./london   TRAFFIC   BILL. Memorandum by the Minister of Transport. As the Cabinet is aware, the question of the increasingcongestion of London traffic is one which calls for Immediate attention, and its urgency is increased by the approaching British Empire Exhibition, which will assist In creating an impossible position in the coming summer, unless steps are taken to deal with the difficulty.   As the late Government announced that a Bill for meeting the situation was ready for introduction during the autumn session of last year, additional criticism will have to he met if the present Government delays in taking action.The subject has received consideration from a number of Commissions end Committees during the past 18 years.   The Royal Commission on London Traffic, 190 5, the Select Committee on Motor Traffic, 1913, end the Select Committee on Transport (Metropolitan Area), 1919, in their reports all advocated the setting up of a London Traffic Authority,     In 1P20 the Departmental Committee on London Traffic under the chairmanship of the late Mr ^Kennedy-Jones, appointed by the then Minister of Transport, recommended the creation of an executive authority as a permanent statutory body with power to deal with all matters connected with London traffic. Finally Lord Ullswater&apos;s Commission on London Government last year recommended the creation of an advisory committee to assist the appropriate Minister, in this case the Minister of Transport, on questions affecting London and a large surrounding area as a whole.The present increasingly difficult position arises partly from the growing amount of commercial and private motor traffic, but primarily from the very large number of buses which are now m the streets of London, made worse recently by the competition arising from the smaller owners.   The actual number of small owners&apos; buses is only about 200 out of s total of about 5,000 but their presence forces t^e London General Omnibus Company and its allies to crowd all the routes in order to leave no opening for the increase of this competition.   A disappearance of these buses
IQfldue.: ^t^x^ommeraial reaeonB would, relieve the immediate- difficulty.&apos;-u ^The exiatin&amp; powers administered by the Police are totally inadequate, and In some oases the Bailee are making traffic adopt rules which they have no real power to enforce.Before I took offioe and had aocesa to full information I held the view that traffic regulation was a municipal responsibility and that a scheme could easily be prepared to give to the municipal-ity the necessary powers.   I had not realised the fundamental difference between London and other cities,   la other places there is sne municipal authority which is also the highway authority, the police authority, often also the tramway authority. In London these powers are scattered.   The London County Council ia neither the highway authority nor the police authority nor the licensing authority for omnibuses.   It is only one of several municipal and private tramway authorities.   The municipal boroughs, the City and the counties and the county boroughs within the Metropolitan Police area, are all very Jealous of the London County Council and it is impossible In my view to give any new powers to the London County Council or to constitute by agreement any composite municipal authority for the purpose of London traffic.While I believe that the right policy for the Labour Rarty is to recite a proper local authority for London, I do not think that the traffic problem need or should wait for the solution of the larger problem.X find that the possible solutions of the problem are three: (l) the constitution ef a paid executive authority on the liaea of the Kennedy-Jones report.(2) the constitution of an indirectly elected body such as the Metropolitan letter Board.(s) giving power to the Minister of Trans port te make regulations, etc., on the advice of an advisory commit tee, the constitution of the advisory committee to be either wholly municipal^, cr partly municipal, partly governmental, and partly representative of the industries concerned.With regard to (l), the chief oejections to a peid executive authority of this nature are that it would be necessary to levy a wte to support it, but it would be non-elective, not responsible to any rate-paying body, and only theoretically responsible even to a Minister,With regard to (2)   the difficulty   lies   in   the
praotioal impossibility of getting an agreement &quot;between the London County Council, the City Corporation-, the Municipal and the County Boroughs and the Councils of the adjacent counties as to the composition, the powers, or the contributions to the coat, of such a body. Even if agreement is ever possible a long time would elapse before negotiations with regard to its constitution could be satisfactorily concluded.   It is also not perhaps desirable to create another body of .this nature when it is understood to be the aim of many members of the Party to abolish those that already existeA further objection to both these schemes is that traffic regulation is in administration a police function.     In London, other than the City, the Home Secretary is the Police Authority and could not be in the position of accepting without any possibility of veto the decisions of a wholly independent authority.I have therefore come to the same conclusion as my predecessors and consider that a Committee should be formed, composed of representatives of the local authorities in the a^ea,   *he Police who will have to administer the regulations, the Home Office and the Ministry of Transport, and if possible the Trade Unions and other representatives of the transport industries within the area.   This statutory Committee would advise the Minister on the exercise of new powers to be conferred on him.These powers would be:- ,1.     To make regulations with regard to:-i.   general control of traffic, e.g. prescribing the routes to be followed by particular classes of traffic, the spee&apos;d of different classes of vehicles, rules as to precedence, conditions of loading and unloading, delivery of goods, collection of refuse, etc.
(ii)   vehicles of special descriptions, waiting, unattended or broken-down vehicles, cab ranks, hackney carriages not hired and not on a cab rank;(iii)    ^obstructions to traffic, e.g. lighting and guarding of street works, erection of works likely to hinder the free circulation of traffic, queues, etc.Each regulation would be laid before Parliament as soonas it is made, and may be annulled by His Majesty inCouncil if an address is presented against it within twenty-one days.2.     New powers for dealing with omnibuses are taken&apos;.At present licences for omnibuses can only be refusedto applicants on the grounds of the unsuitability ofthe vehicle or that the licensing authority is not satia-fied that the applicant is a suitable person to hold a licence.     Power will now be given(i)   to the licensing authority to attach conditions to the licence requiring the omnibus to ply for hire only, on authorised routes and the holder of the licence to maintain a regular service.    A right of appeal to the Minister against a condition attached to the licence is given to the holder;(ii)   to the Minister to specify streets where itis desirable to limit the number of omnibuses plying for hire either owing to the width of. the street, the density of traffic in the street, or to the.existence of alternative facilities for the conveyance of passengers. Where the Minister has so restricted a street he may prohibit omnibuses from plying for hire, or may limit the number of such omni-buses and may apportion among various pro-proprietors the number of omnibuses which he allows to ply.3.     To call for half yearly returns from the Highway Authorities of their proposed programmes for the forth-coming six months of street improvements on certain streets which would be the main through routes, and to make Orders specifying -the&apos; times at which each of
these works shall be commenced in order to avoid simultaneous blocking of alternative routes.The major part of the programme of the Highway Authorities already come to the Ministry in connection with the classification grant and the engineers of the Ministry already make suggestions&apos; to avoid the simultaneous blocking of alternative routes but they have no power to enforce their suggestions.Power is also taken to co-ordinate and to a limited degree to restrict the opening of streets by gas and water undertakings, etc.4,     To extend to all authorities within the area the power already possessed by the Middlesex County Council of fixing a building line on arterial roads.In addition it would be the duty of the Advisory Committee to report to the Minister on any matter referred to them in connection with any of his powers in relation to traffic on.streets in the. traffic area, and, inter alia, on Private Bills affecting traffic, including railway bills;   schemes for new systems of transport and the improvement or extension of existing systems, including the power to suggest the allocation of expenditure falling on the highway authorities among all the authorities in the area.    Such a suggested allocation would have no binding force but would form a basis for negotiation in the oase of larger schemes requiring special legislation.It will be appreciated that though this Committee is called advisory it will in fact be the effective authority.     The Minister might veto or modify a proposed regulation,&apos; for instance if the
K nJrCommittee wished to over-ride the Police Authorities and the Home Secretary objected, but he could never make a regulation of which the Committee disapproved.The expenses of the committee would be part of the administrative expenses of the Roads Department of the Ministry and would fall on the Road Fund;   the additional expenses involved would of course be very muoh less than those Incurred by setting up any independent authority.I realise that objection may be taken to this scheme oh the ground that it creates one more anomaly in London Government, but I may point out that if and when it becomes possible to set up one authority for the Greater London area, it will be easier to transfer to the Authority the powers of the Minister under an arrangement of this nature, than to transfer the powers of an independent body such as the Metropolitan Asylums Board.A large measure of agreement has been secured for this proposal and I am satisfied that it is the only scheme which possesses any chance of being passed into law, during this Parliament.     I should make it clear that it is only a temporary measure and for this purpose should limit its operation to three years.The position may therefore be summarised:1. The congestion of London traffic will be very serious this Summer and will be made more conspicuous by the presence of visitors for the British Empire Exhibition.2. lleitber the Ministry nor the Police nor any of the many local authorities concerned have any powers to secure improvement.3.    The last Government announced their intention of dealing with the difficulty immediately and the London public,&apos; aa represented by the Press, will be naturally indignant if this Government does not put forward some scheme.    London is the
only great city in the world which is devoid of powers and is the only city in this country where there is no power to limit the number of omnibuses.4.    The Home Office for Police Authorities, the Trade Unions concerned with transport, the Operating Companies, and the Municipal Authorities operating trams are all agreed that powers -of control should be obtained, and had accepted substantially the proposals of the late Government.5.    I am informed that trouble will shortly arise on the -tramways, since the men have put in an application for an increase of wages and the employers say it is impossible to grant an increase and difficult to maintain the present standard unless some protection is given to the trams.     The Joint Industrial Council of the industry urged this on my predecessor and is coming to urge it on me.    This&apos;difficulty is not strictly a problem of traffic control but is obsiously closely connected.6.    On the other hand very strong exoeption is taken by members of the London Labour Party, who will probably receive whole-hearted support from London Liberal Members, to the present proposals, on the ground that traffic control is a municipal matter and ought not to be dealt with by ministerial regulation even with the assistance of an advisory committee on which the municipal authorities are strongly represented.    While entirely agreeing with this view as a general proposition I do not think that the control of London traffio should be made to wait on the realisation of the Labour party&apos;s policy for the Government of London as a whole.I recommend the Cabinet to approve the present proposals as an interim measure limited by the Bill to three years.   ^It will be explained that the Party adhere to the view that a general reform of London government is necessary and is not prejudiced   by this proposal.     Should the Cabinet agree to my recommendation it Mill, in my opinion, be necessary to see again
the meiiibers of tho-JjoMcuaiabow party as actual opposition from thorn in the House, which might obtain Liberal support, would be very damaging.(initialled)   H.G.
