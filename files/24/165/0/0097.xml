(This document is the Property of His Britannic Majestyy&apos;s Government).SECRET.\[J *lj h)CP.195(84).CABINET.13HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.BOROUGH COUNCILLORS (ALTERATION OP HUiiBBR) BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The number of Councillors of a borough cannot be altered, as the law at present stands, except by a private Bill or in certain events by a provisional order confirmed by Parliament.     It froquontly happens that in a town which has grown in population an increase of the number of. councillors is found desirable for the purpose of carrying out the additional work thrown oh the local authority and its Committees, or of, giving increased representation to wards which have developed more rapidly than others, or for other causes;   and the absence of any power vfco provide for an increase of the number of councillors without recourse to Parliament is a serious defect in the law, causing much unnecessary inconvenience and expense to the local authorities.Tho Bill proposes to enable the number of borough councillors to be altered by the sans procedure as that by which the wards of the borough nay be altered under the existing law viz., by an Order in Council in the case of a municipal borough and by an Order of the Secretary of State in the case of a metropolitan borough.Identical proposals were made in a Bill which was introduced in the House of Lords towards the end of last year&apos;s session, so that the subject might be ventilated.    No representation against that Bill was received, and as the proposals are supported by the Association of Municipal Corporations and the Metropolitan Borough Standing Joint Committee, the measure is almost certain to be uncontroversial.In a number of the London boroughs, ward adjustments are necessary and ought to be made in time to operate for tho triennial elections of councillors next year.     It is vory desirable that the Bill should be passed early this session, so as to facilitate these adjustments.I ask for authority to introduce a bill in the same form as the bill attached which was introduced by. Lord Onslow on behalf &apos; of the Hons Office last session.A.H.18th March, 1924.
Borough Councillors (Alteration of Number).  [h.l.]MEMORANDUM.As the law stands at present the number of coun-cillors of a borough cannot be altered except by a private Bill or, in certain events, by a provisional order confirmed by Parliament. This Bill proposes to enable the number of borough councillors to be altered by the same procedure by which the wards of a borough may be altered under the existing law, viz., by an Order in Council in the case of a municipal borough, and by an order of the Secretary of State in the case of a metropolitan borough. By this means the number of councillors could be altered without the expense and delay which is involved in special legislation, and the change would also facilitate the re-arrangement of borough wards and the distribution of councillors amongst them,
