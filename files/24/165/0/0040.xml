(&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1924.SECRET.O.P. 139 (24 .CABINET.CONCLUSIONS OF THE IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.This Memorandum has been prepared in accordance with Cabinet Conclusions 16 (24), 3 (o), of the21st February, 1924.(The references are to the various sections of the &quot; Summary of Proceedings,&quot; published in Cmd. 1987.)VL-Publicity.AS stated in the Summary of Proceedings (page 10), a discussion took place, at the instance of the Prime Minister of Canada, as to the desire of the Parliaments of the various parts of the Empire to be afforded the fullest possible information on all matters concerning which negotiations were going on, or discussions taking place, between the various Governments, and a general understanding was reached as to the principles which should govern the publication of correspondence between the Governments. The Conference itself drew up a statement embodying the principles in question. It was decided not to publish this statement at the time, but that the statement should be communicated to the Dominion Governments officially for use by any of the Prime Ministers who might wish to make a public announcement on the subject. My predecessors despatch sending out the statement went on the 21st December, 1923. Mr. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada, has already made a public announcement utilising the statement.VIII. Foreign Relations.(1.) Reference is made on page 11 of the Summary of Proceedings to the overtures made by the President of the United States regarding the participation of the United States Government in an international conference or enquiry to investigate the European Reparations problem, and the decision of the Conference to take immediate advantage of this overture. Since the Conference terminated, there have been further developments in this connection, viz., the establishment of the Expert Committees under the Reparation Commission. The Dominion Prime Ministers have been kept informed of the position.(2.) On page 12 it is stated that the Conference regarded any policy which would result in breaking up the unity of the German State as inconsistent with the Treaty obligations entered into both by Germany and the Powers, and as incompatible with the future discharge.by Germany of her necessary obligations. This question has since assumed prominence in view of the developments as regards the Separatist movement in the Palatinate, as to which the Dominion Prime Ministers are being kept informed.(3.) The Conference recorded its satisfaction at the conclusion of peace between the Allies and Turkey (page 12). Enquiry was made of the Dominion Governments some months ago whether they concurred&apos;in the ratification of the Treaty, and the other instruments forming part of the Peace Settlement, but. for the most part no definite replies have so far been received. Further communications, are now being sent to the Dominion Governments in view of the introduction into the Imperial Parliament of legislation to give effect to the Treaty.(4.) The Summary of Proceedings refers (page 12) to the consideration by the Conference of the question of the regulation of the liquor traffic off the American coasts and its conclusion that, while affirming and safeguarding as a cardinal feature [111804]
of British policy the principle of the 3-mile limit, it was yet desirable and practic-able to meet the American request for an extension of the right of search beyond this limit for the special purpose in question. The terms of the draft Treaty prepared with this object were communicated to the Dominion Governments by my predecessor with an enquiry whether they concurred in the terms of the Treaty, with a view to its signature by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington. &quot; Replies in the affirmative were received from all the Dominions. Some wish to consult their Parliaments before agreeing to ratification.  The Treaty has now been signed.(5.) On the general question of the limits of Territorial Waters, the Conference adopted a number of resolutions which were not published at the time, but have been communicated officially to the Dominion Governments for their concurrence.IX. Negotiation, Signature and Ratification of Treaties.The terms of the Resolution adopted by the Conference are quoted on pages 13-15 of the Summary of Proceedings. They were communicated to the Dominion Governments by my predecessor, with an intimation that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to adopt the procedure described in the Resolution and an enquiry whether the Dominion Governments also were prepared to adopt that procedure. The Canadian and Union Governments have agreed to the procedure proposed, but no replies have yet been received from the other Dominions. The Secretary of state for India has communicated the Resolution to the Government of India, with a request that the procedure described in it may be followed.X. The United States and &quot; C &quot; Mandates.The question discussed by the Conference (though this is not mentioned in the Summary of Proceedings) was the reply to be returned to representations by the United States Government as to the treatment of United States nationals and goods in territories administered under &quot; C &quot; Mandates (i.e., those mentioned in Article 22, paragraph 6, of the Covenant as territories which &quot; can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory &quot;). The terms of Notes to be addressed to the United States Government in this connection were discussed with the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa before their departure from this country. The Prime Minister of New Zealand then expressed the desire that further consideration of the questions at issue might be deferred until he had had an opportunity of consulting the New Zealand Cabinet after his arrival in the Dominion. No communication has been received from New Zealand since Mr. Massey&apos;s return, so that at the moment the matter is in abeyance.XL- Condominium in the New Hebrides.The Resolution adopted by the Conference (which was not published) was to the effect that the French Government should be approached with a view to the partition of the Islands between the British Empire and France under two separate Mandates. I have recently sent a telegram asking the Governments of the Common-wealth of Australia and New Zealand whether they agree to the French Government being approached in this sense at an early opportunity.XII. Defence.On page 16 reference is made to the projected Empire Cruise of a squadron of modern warships. This squadron started in November 1923 and has now reached Australia.The Resolutions adopted by the Conference on defence matters are quoted on pages 16-17 of the Summary of Proceedings. The chief question of principle requiring decision concerns the establishment of the proposed new Naval Base at Singapore see Resolution 3 (c) and 4 (a). The Dominion Governments have been informed by telegraph that His Majesty&apos;s Government have appointed a Cabinet &quot;Committee to examine the matter, and have been promised a further communication as soon as the Committee has reported.. It may also be mentioned: (a) that despatches are about to be sent to the Dominions (except the Irish Free State in view of the Naval Clauses of the Irish Treaty) as to co-operation between the Naval staffs in this country and in the Dominions, so as to help in securing maximum efficiency for the Naval Forces contemplated under Resolution 3 id); (b) that despatches have already been sent to Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa as to a common system of organisation and training for the Air Forces see Resolution 3 (e).
Colonial Office, February 29, 1924.J. H. T.The discussion on Air Defence in the House of Commons on the 19th February, 1924, is being sent to the Dominions by despatch. (See Resolution 4 (c) and 5.)XIII. Status of High Commissioners.The two questions discussed by the Conference were (a.) The   possibility   of   obtaining   some   special   precedence   for   High Commissioners.(b.) The possibility of extending the privileges at present granted to High Commissioners as regards exemption from taxation and similar matters.As regards the first question, a letter was addressed to the Dominion Prime Ministers by my predecessor, as a result of discussion between the Ministers concerned, embodying certain proposals which had previously been approved by the King (to the effect that High Commissioners should have precedence immediately after British and Dominion Cabinet Ministers). The Prime Ministers of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia have agreed to these proposals. The replies from the others are still outstanding.The second question is at present under discussion between the Colonial Office and the Treasury.XIV. Position of Indians in Other Parts of the Empire.The main proposal of the Indian Delegation was to the effect that the Dominion Governments concerned and the British Government for the Colonies and Protec-torates should agree to the appointment of Committees to confer with a Committee appointed by the Indian Government as to the best and quickest means of giving effect to the Resolution of the 1921 Conference on the subject. The opinions expressed and the conclusions reached with regard to the suggestions of the Indian Delegation are summarised on pages 18-20 of the Summary of Proceedings.As regards the Colonies and Protectorates, my predecessor cordially accepted the proposal that there should be full consultation and discussion between, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and a committee appointed by the Government of India. A committee is being appointed and is expected to reach England about the end of March. It is believed that its first step will be to make representations regarding the position of Indians in Kenya, and in particular the Immigration legislation which has been proposed. It is expected that the revised draft legislation will be received from Kenya about the same time.XVI. Nationality Questions.(1.) The grant of naturalisation to persons resident in Mandated Territories. The recommendation approved by the Conference was that the power of granting Certificates of Imperial Naturalisation should be extended so as to cover persons resident in &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; Mandated Territories and Protectorates. A Bill is being drafted to give effect to this recommendation.(&quot;B&quot; Mandated Territories are Tanganyika and the British Spheres of Togoland and the Cameroons. For &quot;C&quot; Mandated Territories, see under X above.)(2.) The appointment of Committees of Enquiry in connection with the Revocation of Certificates.The conclusion of the Conference Committee on this subject, which was approved by the Conference, is quoted on page 21 of the Summary of Proceedings. A statement of the practice in this country is being prepared by the Home Office for the information of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. (3.) The Nationality of Married Women.The resolution passed by the Conference Committee and approved by the Conference is quoted on page&quot; 22 of the Summary of Proceedings. This matter is being dealt with in the draft Bill referred to under (1).XVIII. Proposed Extension of the Powers of the Imperial War Graves Commission.The proposal approved by the Conference was that the Charters of the Commis-sion should be amended by the addition of a clause, the terms of which are set out on page 23 of the Summary of Proceedings.  The necessary action has been taken.
