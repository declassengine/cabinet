Referred to Committee of Home Affairs[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet. *) nSECRET.O.P. 153 (24).CABINET.AUXILIARY AIR FORCE AND AIR FORCE RESERVE BILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AT a meeting held on the 6th February the Cabinet decided that the Auxiliary Air Force and Air Force Reserve Bill should be introduced this session. The Home Affairs Committee have since recommended that it should be placed in the category of essential Bills of very great urgency a recommendation endorsed by the Cabinet on the 13th February.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, the draft Bill, together with a Note explaining its scope and purport.I am anxious to arrange for the introduction of this Bill as early as possible.T.,Secretary of State for Air.Air Ministry, March 3, 1924.Explanatory Note.Formation of an Auxiliary Air Force.STATUTORY authority for the raising and maintaining of an Auxiliary Air Force is contained in Section 6 of the Air Force (Constitution) Act, 1917, which also provides for the application by Order in Council to the Auxiliary Air Force of any enactments relating to the Territorial Army. To rely on these existing powers would, however, be unsatisfactory in two important respects:- (i.) It would be necessary on legal grounds to set up new and separate local Associations to administer the Auxiliary Air Force instead of utilising, as we desire to do, the machinery already provided by the existing Terri-torial Associations, unless and until it is found necessary in practice to establish our own separate Associations.&apos; These Associations are, in fact, willing and desirous to render assistance in raising and administering the Auxiliary Air Force, and a scheme for the purpose has been drawn up in consultation with them and with the War Office.(ii.) Application by Order in Council of existing enactments would not enable us to require all officers and men of the Auxiliary Air Force to accept a liability to be called out for home defence in advance of the Proclamation calling out the Air Force Reserve on permanent service.&quot; In a future European war air action would be the first form of hostilities, and would probably break out well in advance of any encounters between the naval or land forces. It is therefore essential that power should be taken to mobilise the Auxiliary Air Force at a moments notice, without waiting to comply with the normal procedure, of communicating the emergency to ...&quot; Parliament, or declaring it in Council, and then issuing a Proclamation. (&quot;11316] &quot; b
2. The Bill that is proposed (and circulated herewith) will have the effect of overcoming these difficulties by providing for the alternatives of administration of the Auxiliary Air Force either by the existing County Associations, or, if found desirable, by Auxiliary Air Force Associations specially set up, and for the imposition of a liability upon members of the&apos; force to be called up for service, in advance of the calling out on permanent service of the Army or Air Force Reserve, in case of apprehended or actual attack on the British Islands. It will be seen from Clause 6 (5) of the Bill that the latter obligation includes the liability to fly outside the limits of the British Islands and Territorial waters thereof on any flight of which the points of departure and intended return are within these limits. The power to call up the Auxiliary Air Force for this service is to be conferred by an Order in Council declaring an emergency. Prior communication to Parliament and subsequent issue of a Proclamation are not to be required.When the Bill has become law, it will be necessary to issue an Order in Council applying to the. Auxiliary Air Force the provisions of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907, adapted as is permissible under Section 6 of the Air Force Constitution Act and modified as provided in this present Bill.3. Generally, the organisation, conditions of service (except as mentioned above), period of training and method of administration will follow those of the Territorial Army. Emoluments will be issued at Royal Air Force rates under conditions similar to those for the Territorial Army. A summary of the scheme is given in Appendix I.4. The Auxiliary Air Force at present proposed will consist of six squadrons (day and night bombing). Although it may later be desirable to increase this number, it is necessary for financial and administrative reasons that the scheme should at first be tested oh a small basis.5. The programme for an Auxiliary Air Force now forms a component part of the scheme for the expansion of the Royal Air Force for Home Defence, and the details of the programme are being worked out concurrently with those for the expansion of the Air Force. The summary given in Appendix I may therefore require to be reviewed and modified as the larger scheme develops.    ,Alterations in the Organisation and Conditions of Service of the Air Force Reserve.6. The scheme for the expansion of the Royal Air Force for Home Defence includes, in addition to the Auxiliary Air Force, the formation of Special Reserve Squadrons. It is proposed that the Reserve personnel required for these squadrons shall be enlisted as a new class of Special Reservists for service in defence of the British Isles only. Like the Auxiliary Air Force, they will be liable to fly outside the limits of the British Islands and the territorial waters thereof on any flight of which the points of departure and intended return are within those limits. . : The proposed Bill gives power to enlist this new class of Special Reservist.  ,A summary of the scheme for these Special Reserve squadrons is given in Appendix II.7. For a similar reason to that mentioned in paragraph 1 (ii) above it is necessary that we should have power to call out for home defence the whole of the Air Force Reserve (including the new class of Special Reservists referred to in the preceding paragraph) without waiting to comply with the normal procedure of communicating the emergency to Parliament or declaring it in Council and issuing a Proclamation.The proposed Bill will give us this power so far as future enlistments are concerned and enable us to enter into agreements to the same effect with airmen already enlisted. Apart from this provision, the liabilities of Reservists to be called up in advance of a Proclamation will remain as they now stand under existing legislation : that is, Reservists will be liable to be called up for overseas service in advance of a proclamation if, and only if, they have entered into a voluntary agree-ment to that end (Section 1 of the R.F. and M. Act, 1898, and Section 32 of the T.F. and R.F. Act, 4907) and have been originally enlisted for general service.It will be necessary, when the Bill has been passed, to issue an Order in Council applying to the Air Force Reserve the provisions of the Reserve Forces Act, 1882, as amended by subsequent Acts, and Part III of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907, adapted as is permissible under Section 6 of the Air Force (Constitution) Act, 19i7, and modified as provided in this Bill.8. When the Bill has been passed and the necessary Orders in Council issued the conditions of service of the Auxiliary Air Force and the Air Force Reserve will be as follows: 
Before the Issue of a Proela-. mation or communication  . to Parliament.9 &quot;79After the Issue of a Proclamation in case&apos; of imminent national danger or great; emergency.,,Auxiliary Air Force.Air Force Reserve (Future Enlistments).Ordinary Reservists.Ordinary Reservists who have entered into agreements under Section 1 of &quot; The Reserve Forces and Militia Act, 1898.&quot;Special Reservists enlisted under Section 30 of &quot; The Terri-torial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907.&quot;Special Reservists enlisted under Section 30 of &quot; The Terri-torial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907,&quot; who have entered into agreements under Section 32 of the same Act.Special Reservists enlisted under Section 3 (4) of the present Bill.To be called out and serve in defence of the British Islands against actual or apprehended attack.To be called out and serve in defence of the British Islands against actual or apprehended attack.To be called out and serve in defence of the British Islands against actual or apprehended attack, or in any place outside the British Islands when warlike operations are in preparation or in progress.To be called out and serve in defence of the British Islands against actual or apprehended attack.To be called out and serve in defence of the British Islands against actual or apprehended attack, or in any place outside the British Islands when warlike operations are in preparation or in progress.To be called out and serve in defence of the British Islands against actual or apprehended attack.To be called out and&apos;serve,in any part of the United Kingdom. Also in the case of those who have entered into special agree-ments under Section 13 (2) (a) of &quot; The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907,&quot; to serve in auy place outside the United King-dom.To be called out and serve in the British Islands or any place outside the British Islands.To be called out and serve in the British Islands or any place outside the British Islands.,To be called out and serve in the British Islands or any place outside the British Islands.To be called out and serve in the British Islands or in any place outside the British Islands.To be called out and serve in any part of the British Islands.Note. The liability to serve in defence of the British Islands against actual or apprehended attack includes the liability to fly outside the limits of the British Islands or the territorial waters thereof, on atiy flight of which the points of departure and intended return are within those limits.APPENDIX I.Summary of Scheme for Auxiliary Air Force. .IT is intended that the Auxiliary Air Force should assume part of the responsi-bility for the air defence of the United Kingdom from air attack in case of war. Its specific function in the organisation of this defence would lie in its formation into bombing squadrons to assist an air counter-offensive against enemy forces and estah-lishments in hostile territory. Such an offensive would be essential to any scheme for the defence of Great Britain against attack from the air.2. It is advisable to restrict the Auxiliary Air Force to small dimensions at its inception and until the efficiency for air work of squadrons raised on an auxiliary basis has been practically tested. .       - .[11316] b 2
3. It is therefore proposed to raise six squadrons only in the first instance. Two factors govern the location of the peace stations of these squadrons, namely :-. (a.) The existence of an engineering population from whom skilled mechanicscan be enlisted.  ............... I(6.) The propinquity of an aerodrome or suitable site for an aerodrome.4.. The following have been tentatively selected as fulfilling the above conditions :-London . ... ...         ...        ...     2 squadrons.Birmingham ...         ...         ...      1 squadron..               Sheffield   ... ...        ...         .... 1 squadron.Glasgow  ... ...         ...        ...      1 squadron.The tentative location of the sixth squadron has not yet been settled. ;   The sites selected fulfil condition (a), but it is not yet certain that they will fulfil condition (6).5. i Each squadron will have a small permanent staff of Royal Air Force personnel and will be provided with sufficient aeroplanes and equipment to enable pilots to obtain flying practice and mechanics to learn to apply their civil trade in the maintenance of aircraft.6. The raising and administration of Auxiliary Air Force squadrons will, so far as possible, be entrusted to the County Associations which already exist for administering the Territorial Army.The operational training of the Auxiliary Air Force will be supervised by Royal Air Force Home Defence Headquarters.7. The approximate strength of the Auxiliary Air Force on the above basis will be 160 officers and 1,000 other ranks.8. Terms of Service Officers. In the initial formation of the Auxiliary Air Force the Commanding Officers of each unit will be appointed by the Air Ministry after consultation with the County Joint Association concerned. The Commanding Officer, after consultation with the local County Joint Association, will nominate to the Air Ministry gentlemen to fill the remaining vacancies on the establishment of his unit. Subsequent nominations for commissions will be made to the Air Ministry by the President of the County Joint Association.9. Terms of Service Other Ranks. The normal period of engagement will be 4 years. Men for technical duties will be required to pass a test before acceptance.10. Training. The training will consist of (a) drills and instructional parades,(b) periodical flying for officers of the General Duties Branch and airmen pilots,(c) annual training. In addition, officers and N.C.Os. may be required to attend certain obligatory courses of instruction in specialist subjects at Royal Air Force schools. Voluntary courses will also be provided. For annual training the whole unit will normally proceed to a Royal Air Force station, where training in combined operations will be carried out in conjunction with one or more regular squadrons.11. Permanent Staff of Units. Each squadron will be provided with (a) a regular Air Force officer as adjutant, (b) four non-commissioned officer instructors, (c) sufficient aircraftmen to undertake the custody of the aeroplanes and material allotted to the squadron.APPENDIX II.Summary of Scheme for Special Reserve Squadrons.THE Special Reserve Squadrons like the Auxiliary Air Force are intended to assume part of the responsibility for the defence of the United Kingdom from air attack. The role allotted to them in the organisation for Home Defence would also lie in their formation into bombing squadrons to assist in an air counter-offensive against enemy forces and establishments in hostile territory.2. It is proposed that the number of Special Reserve Squadrons shall in the first place consist of 7 Day or Night Bombing Squadrons, each composed of 3 or 2 Flights respectively.
The squadrons would be manned by the Special Reservists referred to in Section 3 (4) of the draft Bill with a fairly large nucleus of Regular personnel. Squadron headquarters, including technical workshops, &amp;c, would be manned mainly with Regular personnel, but would include a proportion of Special Reservists. A proportion of the personnel required will also be provided on a civilian basis:3. It is intended that the Special Reservist airmen required shall be raised from among the employees of large engineering firms, who will be invited to co-operate in the scheme. A supply of airmen for the skilled trades should thus be assured with but little additional training.It will be necessary that the peace stations of the Special Reserve Squadrons shall be in the vicinity of the works of the firms from whose employees the personnel are raised, and that an aerodrome or suitable site for an aerodrome shall be. available in the neighbourhood.The approximate number of Reserve personnel required for 7 Squadrons will be 104 officers and 780 airmen.4. Full initial equipment (without reserves) of service aircraft will be issued to the Squadrons at their peace stations, together with such instructional equipment as may be necessary.5. The reserve personnel for the Special Reserve Squadrons will be administered and their operational training and exercises supervised by the R.A.F. Home Defence Headquarters.6. Term of Service. Officers will be required to undertake a definite term of service with a minimum of four years.In view of the experimental character of these Special Reserve Squadrons, the terms of service of airmen will in the first instance be made as elastic as possible, men being invited to engage for periods of from one to five years.7. Training. Officers who are not already qualified will be required either to undergo a continuous course of instruction or, if they have not the time for such a continuous course, to undergo intermittent instruction.They would be required to come up for periodical flying practice and other annual training at prescribed intervals.Airmen would be liable to undergo an adequate course of. service training in the first year and subsequently to attend their unit for instruction and practice on not less than fourteen days annually, either consecutively or to be spread over the whole year, to suit the individual convenience of the airman.The whole Squadron would proceed periodically to its war station for training as a unit.8. It will be realised that the foregoing remarks are merely intended to convey a rough outline of the scheme, and that it will probably be necessary to introduce various modifications as the scheme develops and the details are worked out.
Auxiliary Air Force and Air Force Reserve Bill.MEMORANDUM.By virtue of s. 6 (2) of the Air Force (Constitution) Act, 1917, His Majesty was empowered, by Order in Council, to apply with, the necessary adaptations to the air force reserve, or to the auxiliary air force, or to the officers or men of any such force, any enactment relating to the army reserve or to the territorial force (now the territorial army see 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5. c. 37) or to the officers and men of those forces.Under this Bill it is intended to extend the power of applying these enactments so as to enable substantial changes to be made in them in their application to the auxiliary air force and the air force reserve. The principal changes proposed are-Auxiliary Air Force.1. That county associations may be established under Part I. of the Act of 1907 which may administer both the territorial army and the auxiliary air force within the county, and that this arrangement may, if it is thought desirable, be terminated, in which case separate associations may be formed for purposes of the territorial army only (as at present) and of the auxiliary air force respectively.2. That a condition may be imposed on officers and men of the auxiliary air force that they shall undertake liability to be called up for service within the British Islands in case of actual or apprehended attack in defence of the British Islands whether or not the army reserve or air force reserve have been called out on permanent service.Air Force Reserve.3.
