HOME   A.MIBS   CCWItTIB.BRITISH EMPISE^EXIiyXj-riCf. mo ran dam by the Parliamentary Secretary, Department of Qyereea s It a de.I attach a draft of a Bill, the object of which is to amend the British Empire Exhibition (Guarantee) Act of 1920 by increasing the present Government Guarantee to the British Empire Exhibition from one hundred thousand pounds to six hundred thousand pounds.     It is intended that the additional guarantee of  500,000 should rani: part passu with the original Government guarantee and those given by firms, corporations, private Individuals etc.     In order to show the need for this additional guarantee, I think I cannot do better than circulate, for the Information of the Committee, a confidential memorandum which has been prepared by the British Empire Exhibition authorities. It is shown that Messrs. Lloyd&apos;s Bank have already advanced money to the Exhibition beyond the amount of the guarantees (they also have as security the Title Deeds of the Exhibition buildings), and they have now informed the Management that they are not prepared to make any more advances unless a further Government Guarantee is immediately forthcoming. Such a guarantee could not be given without legislation -hence the necessity for this Bill.     In the present state ^ of the business of the House I fully realise that the chances of getting such a Bill through all its stages before the Easter recess, are almost non-existent, but I desire topress/
press as strongly as I can the desirability of introducing the Bill Immediately ae a gesture of good faith.    Ae public monies are involved the Bill would require a Financial Resolution.I think it ia almost unnecessary for me to stress the fact that it- would be a most disastrous calamity if at the present time a crisis should arise in the affairs of the Exhibition through lack of funds.(Signed) WILhIAM ims.18th March, 1924.
BRITISH   EMPIRE   BEHIBIffllOM.Memorandum supplied by the Board of Management on the Financial Position of the Exhibition.When the Board, appointed by resolution of the Executive Council in December, 1922, assumed control of the British Empire Exhibition early in 1983, the total estimated expenditure on the construction of the Exhibition was  1,600,000. and Lloyd&apos;s Bank had agreed to advance up to this amount on the security of the Guarantee ?und and the title deeds of the freehold land, buildings, Ac.    (Shis does not of course include the construction of the Dominion and Colonial buildings or the installation of Amusements, Exhibitors1 Kiosks fee,-6c, but only the expenditure to be incurred by the Executive Council).At that time the participation of the Overseas Empire in the Exhibition was far from complete, but as a result of the feeling of confidence created by the appointment of the Board and of the special efforts made by the Board to secure the co-operation of the Dominions and Colonies who were still undecided or had even taken an adverse decision, the position now is that every unit of the Empire will be represented at the Exhibition with the exception of the Irish Free State and British Horth Borneo.    (Financial conditions are responsible for the abstention of the former, though it is hoped that the State will occupy the Civic Hall in the Exhibition for a short period, and will not, therefore, be entirely unrepresented at the Exhibition).She extensive scale on which the Overseas Empire finally decided to participate in the Exhibition necessitated theacquisition/
acquisition of additional land, ana a consequent increase in the estimates for roads, bridges, gardens and general services.    Moreover when th6 negotiations for the catering concession reached a head in September last it was found that considerable additional expenditure was necessary owing to the large number of restaurants and tea-r.aomo which had to be erected.    With a view to economising as much aB possible the Board suppressed one or two schemes of an expensive and somewhat speculative character,(e.g. a Club and Swimming Pool)^ but in regard to most of the projects in the Exhibition, commitments had already been entered into and the work put in hand so that it was not possible to do much in this direction. When the revision of the estimate was completed it was found that additional expenditure amounting to  400,000 was involved which increased the amount of credit required to a total of  2,000,000.   In arriving at this figure account was taken of revenue which it was anticipated would accrue by way of subscriptions to the Fellowship of the British Empire Exhibition.Lloyd&apos;8 Bank were not prepared without further security to advance the additional  400,000 required, and the Board consequently approached the Trade Facilities committee with a view to arranging a Guarantee.   That scheme has been dropped in favour of the present Bill but on the strength of assurances given in this connection the Bank has consented to finance the Association up to  2,000,000,At the beginning of the present year the Board being considerably perturbed at the rapid growth of expenditure appointed a special Committee to investigate the financial position in consultation with the technical,officers in order to ascertain whether it would be possible to complete the construction of the Exhibition within the estimated figure of 2,000.000,/
-3-608 2,000,000.     The result of these enquiries was an estimate by the technical officers that up to the opening of the Exhibition additional expenditure amounting to  600,000 would be necessary.    As against this only  300,000 was covered by the estimates leaving an excess of  300,000 still to be found.    The reason for this discrepancy between the estimated and the ascertained cost of construction is that owing to the rapidity with which the work has to be carried on estimates have to be based on preliminary drawings, as in many cases detailed drawings, on which alone accurate estimates can be arrived at, take weeks and sometimes months to prepare.     Moreover the bad weather that has been so prevalent has greatly hampered operations and increased the expenditure, especially in regard to roads which owing to the nature of the soil and the extraordinary amount of traffic literally disappear beneath the surface and have consequently to be re-constructed.This excess of  300,000 on the expenditure side of the estimates has to be doubled owing to a similar deficiency On the revenue side due chiefly to delay in launching the British Empire Exhibition Fellowship.     Owing to the occurrence of the General Election and the uncertain political sttuation since obtaining the scheme has not yet had a fair chance, though a certain amount of support has been secured, 6,000 members having actually joined, and it is hoped that as the Exhibition draws nearer the roll of members will rapidly increase.The bald fact emerging from the above statement is that Lloyd&apos;s Bank have agreed to loan up to two million pounds on the present securities of the Guarantee Fund and the title deeds of the Exhibition buildings.    They have agreedalso/
alao to extend this-figure to  2,600,000 on the assurance that further security will be forthcoming in the manner proposed in the pr-esent Bill.The Amount of the Guarantee Fund to date is.. . 1,207,268.16.0From this should be deducted guarantees&quot;not approved&quot; by the Bank amounting to   ,..     22,860.11.0. 1,185,408. 5.0. Attached is a statement prepared from figures supplied by the Finance Manager to the Exhibition.     These estimates, so far as revenue is concerned, have been prepared on what is considered a very conservative basis, and they show an estimated deficit of  464,000 which is at present regarded as the worst that can happen.The reasons necessitating the provision of additional financial aid :nay be summarised briefly as follows 1)     The decision to participate in the Exhibitionby several members of the Empire who had previously made no decision or had been adverse to participation thus necessitated the acquisition of additional land and the consequent increase in services therefor.2)     The catering concession was not definitely arrangeduntil September, 1923, when investigations showed that-the expenditure required in this connection would be larger than had previously been anticipated.3)     The speed at which work has had to be carried out made it necessary for estimates to be prepared on preliminary    * drawings only and such estimated were in consequence more or less unreliable.
4)     The abnormally wet weather has Increased estimates in regard to roads and similar services.5)     The estimates originally provided for a sum of  300,000 to be received from the sale of tickets in connection with the British Empire Exhibition Fellowship.Delay in launching this scheme has practically wiped out that sum from consideration in the estimates although it is felt that a great portion of it will be pulled up before the opening of&apos; the Exhibition.An estimate of the total number of employees at Wembley puts the figure at 12,000 and it has been stated that for every one employed within the Exhibition, 10 are employed outside.     This again is probably a conservative estimate so that at the lowest computation the Exhibition is directly responsible for the employment of. more than 130,000 people.All estimates and revisions of estimates, particularly those revisions in the statement above have been considered by the Estimates Committee of the Exhibition before being laid before the Board of Management,The Home Governments and the Governments of all theDominions and Colonies are now deeply committed to the exhibition and it is quite unthinkable that the constructionshould have to be stopped at the eleventh hour owing to lackof funds.    .This, however, will be inevitable unless a guaranteea.can be secured at once- for the additional sum of  600,000, which will undoubtedly cover all possible contingencies, as In arriving at this figure no account had been taken of revenue which will accrue before the opening, of the Exhibition.(Note.     The Bill contemplates an additional guarantee of  500,000 only.    &apos;s. L.)

With regard to gate money the estimate has been made on a basis of 20 million visitors.
