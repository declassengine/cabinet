TWIS SECRETnncmJEiNT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITaNHIC M^STYSjTCyaagHMT.CABINET.JP.173 ($4)8 %Copy No.    siPOOR   LAW  REFORM. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.In view of the undertakings which have been given by th Government in regard to Poor Law Reform it will be necessary for the Cabinet at an early date to decide upon the procedure to be followed and the scope and character of the proposed       1 reform.With regard t* the procedure to be followed, there appears to be considerable doubt as to the intentions of the Government.   In some quarters it is suggested that there should be another Royal Commission or an Inquiry by a Depart-mental Committee;   in others, that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons, or to a Toint Committee of the two Houses.There have, aa the Cabinet is well aware, been in-numerable inquiries in regard to the Poor Law, and, while it may bo perfectly true that circumstances have changed and are continually changing, the broad facts of the situation are well known, and all the available information in regard to the over-lapping of the various forms of public assistance has been brought up to date by the Interdepartmental Committee presided   * over by Mr.Betterton.The procedure which I should myself prefer would accordingly be, not so much a Commission or Committee of Inquiry, as a conference between representatives of the three Parties in the House, with a view to arriving, if possible, at an
acreod HCJ::emo.;;*f rof*rm.   -I an anxious to deal wit;.    le Question aa expeditiously as is possible in the circumstances.. I want to rescue my Department from an embarrassing situation and to pave the way for that reorganisation of the system of public assistance which is called for by members of all Parties,     And I should regret the adoption of any course which would mean, or could be regarded as meaning, a mere shelving of the question or an indefinite postponement of reform.     In any event, I think that a.Conference such as I suggest might bo the first step-; and that a Commission or Committee of Inquiry should only be set up if the Conference came to the conclusion that ruch an Inquiry would be necessary before a reform scheme eould be introduced into Parliament.It would, however, no doubt be desirable that the Government should enter euch a Conference with some provisional scheme in their minds, or, at any rate, with some concrete sug-suggestions as to the scope of the reform and the main lines which, it should follow. lor this purpose it would probably be de-eirable tc havs a careful Memorandum prepared which, would servo ae a basis for discussion.Ths first question which will, arise will be whether the proposals should be confined to a scheme for the reform of the Poor Law (a) in London only or (b) in London and the provinces also, or whether they should extend to a general re-organisation of the public social services.A largo comprehensive scheme embracing all kinds of public assistance is no doubt very attractive and would have many adherents.   But the problem would be bo unwieldy that it would probably defy solution, or at tho bost indefinitely postpone useful reform, and before any attempt could be made to frame practical proposale it would almost ocsrtainly bo necessary to appoint another Koyal Commission, the proceedings
ef which- would have to await, cr in some way be linked up with, the work of the present Rcyal Commission on Local Gevernment and the proposed Royal Commission on National Health Insurance. If, on the ether hand, the proposals aoe confined tc the Poor Law, the ground as above -indicated has been sufficiently covered already to obviate the need for further inquiry.Even if the proposals are confined to Poor Law only the question may have to be considered with reference not merely to machinery but also to prinaiples, and it may benecessary to settle the general principles before dealing with1the particular case of London.   But I would nevertheless urge that we should make a beginning with London.     We are much more ,j) likely to seoure a definite result if we deal first with the speoial case of London, and, after all, it is the London difficulty and the indefensible conditions of the London system Which has brought the whole question of Poor Law reform once more to the front.But the oa3e for dealing with London alone in the first instance dees not rest solely upon the particular urgency of the London question.The problem in London is differentiated from the general problem in England and Wales by the existence of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and particularly by the ex-tensien of that Fund by emergency legislation during the present period of unemployment to cover a substantial charge in respect ef the cost of the administration of outdoor relief.     Another feature differentiating London administraten!
from that in the -pro vine eg-^ia -V^tine^exii^ Asyloas Board, which, though primarily a poor law body, is also the -London authority for the provision of hospital ac-oonaode-tion for smallpox end other infectious diseases.The second question to bo considered is the basis of the scheme of reform and it appears to mo to bo clear that, while no doubt nodi float ions in detail will be needed, the general outline should follow the recommendations of the Mac lean Commit toe.Briefly, tho Maclean Committee recommended that tho Poor Law Guardians should bo abolished and that their functions should be handed over to County and County Borough Councils acting through specified statutory committees,     In the case of London they recommended that the administration of Boor law institutions should be handed over to tho London County Council and tho adminis brat ion of outdoor relief to the Mstro-politaa Borough Councils,     But the cost of administering outdoor relief was to be defrays! to the extent of two-thirds by the County Council, provided that tho County Council were satisfied that tho administration was conducted efficiently, economically, and on approved principles.     The County Council was also charged with the duty of laying down the policy and rules of local administration for the&apos; exercise of the Boar law functions assigned to the Borough Councils.It is obvious that a mere transfer of out-relief from the Boards of Guardians to tho Metropolitan Borough Councils would do little towards solving the Poplar problem.     In foplar tho Borough Council and the Board of Guardians are actuated by the same policy and aro indeed largely identical in personnel;, and it is not very likely that the Borough Council would prove itself more amenable to the control of tho London County Council than the Guardians have boon to fee control of the Ministry of Health.
It appears to me therefore that the better plan would be to make the representation on the Local Committees which  are to administer out-relief proportionate to the respective financial contributions of the County Council and of the Borough Councils, that is to say, that these Local Committees should be composed, as to two-thirds, of representatives of the County Council and, as to one-third, of local representatives.

With regard to the administration of functions other than out-relief, it may be argued, and the point will probably be taken up by the London County Council, that they are better able than Parliament to arrange for the performance of the several functions entrusted to them, and that the policy of including in an Act of Parliament a cut and dried scheme involving the establishment of a number of specified statutory committees would be found administratively inconvenient if, in the natural process of development, it should be found necessary or desirable to re-arrange those functions. I am therefore inclined to the view that the scheme should be so designed as to leave the County Council as much freedom as possible in arranging for the performance of the transferred functions. It would, of course, be necessary in any event to consult the London County Council at an early date.

If the Cabinet are in general agreement with the above proposals, I would recommend that inquiries should be set on foot at once to ascertain whether the loaders of the other Parties would be prepared to participate in the suggested Conference, and secondly, that I should be authorised to prepare a memorandum to be laid before the Conference dealing with the Poor Law question (a) primarily as it affects London, and (b) secondly as it affects the country as a whole.

Q 7    .Thls Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.OaDlrigt,Memorandum by the Minister of Health oh the Report of the Unemployment Committee. (CP.148 ( 24)).074(24)Copy No. &apos;OIn connection, with the first recommendation to the Cabinet from the Unemployment Committee in their Report (CP. 148(24)) an Juvenile Unemployment, viz:   that provision should be made by legislation for the extension of Unemployment Insurance to boys and girls from the date on which they first begin to work for wages, I desire to call the particular attention of my colleagues to the statement on pages 3 and 4 of the Report of the Juvenile Unemployment Sub-Committee (C.U. 68D) as to the possible reaction of the proposal on the Health Insurance Scheme.The extension of Unemployment insurance to boys and girls between 14 and 16 years of age should logically involve a similar extension in the case of Health Insurance, but I am convinced that such extension would give rise to great difficulties and that any proposals to that end would meet with serious opposition not only from employers but also from the Friendly Societies..I think this should be home, in mind in considering the advisability of submitting to Parliament proposals for the suggested extension of Unemployment Insurance,I need not say that I am in sympathy with the objects aimed at by the Minister of Labour In this matter, though, as Minister of Health, I am bound to put, on record the repercussions j of hia particular proposal on National,Insurance.ministry of Health.
