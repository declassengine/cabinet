SMALL DJSBS DiiiCRmS - ItfSmMfciHIS - and AilBB^IMEJJT OF WAGES llklTATIOJSfoMSMOBAHDtfM BY 5HS S&amp;0SSSAKX FOR SCOTLAND.,(l)   Attached is a print of a Draft Bill which provides that when decree is granted in Small Debt Courts.in Scotland for a sum due and payment, by instalments is directed, such direction mayt in cases where the debt is arrears of rent, be made subject to sonditions as to the payment of current rent; and that when such conditions are not observed the direction may be rescinded or varied0The.Bill also provides for the increase from 20/- to 30/- of the limit within which the wages of labourers, etc., are net arrestable0(2)   As regards the provision relating to instalments, the position is that Sheriffs have a discretion under Section 18 of the Small Debt (Scotland) Act, 1837. to direct payment by instalments of a debt deoerned for in the Small Debt Court. Where, however, the debt is arrears of rent there is a difficulty in the way of exeroiaing the discretion ov/ing to the lack of power to make the concession cf payment by instalments conditional upon the punctual payment of current rent - a^ course which is open and is adopted under the Rent Restriction Acts. &quot;&apos;.In the Small Debt Court in Glasgow it is, on this account, not usual for instalments to be allowed in the case of decree for a debt which is arrears of rent.    Strong representations have been made to me that there should be a uniform/
uniform-practice.-of exorcising the discretion in the large number of cases for arrears of rent which are now being taken to these Courts, in view of the hardship involved in decree for immediate payment of a substantial sum followed possibly by polanding and gale.     The exercise of the discretionary power rests with the Sheriff but tho removal . of what is regarded as an obstacle to its application is a matter of urgency in view of the effects which the so decrees are producing0     Such removal is the object of the Clause.(3)      Under the Small Debt (Scotland) Act, 1837, the wages of labourers &quot;so far as necessary for their subsistence are not liable to arrestment, and by the Wages Arrestment Limitation (Scotland) Act, 1870,, the wages of labourers, etc., in so far as they do not exceed 80/- per week are rendered not -arrestable.     As regards the surplus over 20/- per week, such surplus remains arre stable &quot;as before the passing of&quot; the Act of 1870.     If, therefore,. it can be shown that the surplus over 20/- or any part of it is necessary for the subsistence of the debtor, the benefit of the exemption oonferred by the Act of 1337 can still be claimed for such surplus or part surplus; but tho enquiry thus necessitated and the delay resulting is apt to involve hardship, and having regard to the alteration in the value of ffionoy since 1870 it is proposed to raise the limit of wages which are not arreatable to 30/-vScottish Office,lhitshall5 S.W.1. 13th March, 1924.(Sgd.)
