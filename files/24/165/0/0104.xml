DOOWKNT is THE PROPERTY OF HIS ERITSj 0 RET. over 200 (24),C A B I I E TPROCEEDINGS OP THF RECENT COUNCIL OF ThTI^GUE OFliATIONST&quot;Eztra-cta^from lettera from the Lord,President jpf the Council t,oi the Frlmellinlater&quot;.(Circulated at the request of the. Lord President of the Council)nI.Geneva, 15th March, 1924, x     x    x    x    x      x    x     x     xAll has gone well at the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations.     My Colleagues greeted me very cordially as representative of the British Government, and we have all worked together to promote League principles and League influence. I am told that the Session has been one of unusual . success, in the number of difficult subjects which have been either settled or Placed in the way of settlement.     These include Saar, Danzig, Memel, and the very troublesome question of Polish nationality, // and the rights, of German residents in what is now Poland.     Mr. Branting has worked very closely with, me, but all my colleagues have readily accepted suggestions which appeared to ve to be in support both of settlement and of League principles,,I should like to add a special word about M. Hanctaux, the French representative,     Naturally matters of difference of &quot;any importance in our discussions arose mainly between M, Hanotaux and myself, especially
on questions in which Poland was directly Interested, hut we carried these through without friction and acted very cordially together in matters on which we wero in agreement     I feel much indebted to him for the attitude which he has, throughout;, adopted-I have had cordial relationships with Dr. Benes end talked much with Mm,     He is in rather a difficult position, but has loyally worked for a settlement of League questions on League principles,I have been very much interested in noting the friendly effect of the meeting of the Council of the   League on the representatives cf different countries and governments.     There is a very general regret that Germany Is not a Member of the League, but in this matter I should wish to talk with you at a convenient time.There were also present at the meetings of the Council two Americans, who had carried through difficult negotiations with great skill and success - Mr,Morgenthau and Mr, Norman Davis,     They both expressed to me the hope that America would join the League, and thought that this would be brought about at no very distant date.,The attitude of my colleagues towards a representative of aLnbour Government, was in an especial way aporeciative, They constantly emphasised the value of your work and of the advantage of combining labour with an Intellectual and pacifist outlook in directing the future of democratic thought and of democratic action.Such, is a short account cf my visit here,     I wish that more could have been known of our work in London and that the real essential spirit of friendll-ness and co-operation between the representatives of all countries here could have been more fully understood.xxxxxxxxxx
::oh:::.igh office,18th March, 1924,i think i should write a continuation of my former, letter&apos; to you about the work of the Council, having regard to the statements which have appeared concern-ing the proceedings of the last day,i should like you to know shortly what the facts are, &apos;Jhe points raised during the meeting of tho Council, in connection with the Saar comprised:-1.     .1 gendarmerie questions,2.     The passage of oaar inhabitants through neighbouring occupied territory.3,     Election of two members to the Governing Commission.On (1). after discussion, it was agreed on my resolution that so soon as the financial cono.ix.ions in the Saar allowed additions should be made to the gendarmerie, even during the current year.     The Financial  ember of the Governing Commission of the;-Saar is Mr.Stevens, a Canadian, and he stated that immediate financial difficulties had arisen from the hundred days coal strike, and. from the loss on railway traffic consequent on the strike, and on the conditions in the neighbouring occupied territories.is to (2) the French withdrew all difficulties and the ..-.atter was settled in a friendly spirit.As to (3) the two members elected were Herr Eossmann and Colonel Espinosa de los Ilonteros.   Herr Kossmann, after considerable negotiation initiated by Lord Cecil on behalf of the British Government, :-bs accepted by M.Hanotaux on behalfof the/
of the French Government.     This, of course, was before I became the British representative.     Pull enquiries were made, and I cannot understand from what source the suggestions made., in &quot;The Times&quot; statement can have originated, and I am sure that they are quite unfair to Herr Kossmann.   There was no discussion, and all members of the Council were agree&amp;*     i may add that Herr Koasmann has been for many years Secretary of a Miners&apos; Trade Union, was member of the German Reichstag from 1912-1818, and member of the Weimar Constituent Assembly elected after tho German revolution,.     Herr Kossman&apos;s quali-fieations will be found in a note attached,,On the election of Colonel Espinosa de los Monteroa, M.3ranting proposed in opposition, MJvleek, a Protestant Norwegian,   Personally, I supports?. ruBranting, but we were defeated by seven votes to three0I feel obliged to protest against the allegations made in &quot;The Times&quot; statement about the member elected.    I should have preferred the Norwegian, but the recommendations of the Spaniard were such that no special objection could be taken to his election0    Should you have an opportunity perhaps you might read a letter by Mr0Wilson Harris in &quot;The Times&quot; to-day.It is more imp or bant that 1 should&apos;express to you my view of the friendly attitude throughout of ths Prench Government.   There was no question of controversial, difference but a friendly co-operation, although naturally some difference of opinion,     I was ouch struck at Geneva by the desire of all members of the Council to reach a fair settlement, and this may in part be attributed to the influence of the support which you have given to the League.4H 11 was
