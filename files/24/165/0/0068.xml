SihlS noCTMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.gCRET, ^7^5(24)CABINET. SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES ACT. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,1. I think It is necessary that a decision should bemade by the Government and announced so scon as possible as to Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921,That part of the Act was designed to.enable action to be taken to safeguard industries in this country against two forms of &quot;dumping&quot; -(a) The sale of imported goods in the United kingdom at prices below their cost of production in the producing country     this provision is permanent; and(b) the sale of imported goods in this country at prices below.those at which similar goods can be manufactured in tho United Kingdom, these lower prices being possible by reason&apos;of the deprecia-tion in relation to sterling of the currency of the producing country - the provisions as to this are In force only to the 19th August next.It is in regard to (b) that a. decision is required, since action in respect of a number of complaints was suspended owing to a decision of my predecessor not to appoint Committees of Enquiry until a decision had been taken by the late Government as to a continuance after August next of the relevant provisions of the Act, and certain other complaints under the Act have recently been received.   Moreover it is desirable that the trades affected by such Orders as have been made under the Act should know as soon as possible whether there is any likelihood or not of the existing orders being continued in force after the 19th August next,2, The complaints as to which action was suspended by my predecessor relate to machine tools; chrome calf upper leather; woollen and worsted gooda (dress gsods for ladies wear); rplled gold, gilt and imitation jewellery; surgical and dental instruments; leather gloves; felt hats, packing paper; and some others,.  The chief complaints reoently received relate to hosiery and cutlery.   The complaints in respect of hosiery and leather glrves have been made by the Joint Industrial&apos; Councils for those industries, and the complaints in respect o&amp; brushes is supported by the Federation of Trade Unicns in the brush-making industry.It is probable that a number cf ether formal complaints would have been made had not tentative en-quirers been informed that the Board had suspended action for the time being.
The only trades in respoct of which orders imposing duties of 33^3 per cent. - the only, rate allowed by the Act - are in operation relate to fabric gloves and glove fabric; domestic, illuminating and mounting glassware; aluminium hollow^ware; wrought enamel hollow^ware and gas mantles; and apply only to such goods imported from Germany,The procedure prescribed by the Act is that if complaint is made to the Board by any industry or branch of industry the complainants must show that the importa-tion of which they complain is from a country whose currency has depreciated by more than 3375 per cent0, that the prices at which the imported goods are being sold are lower than those which the British makers can profitably manufacture, that this is due to the deprecia-tion of the currency of the country In which the Imported goods are manufactured, and that by reason of such im-portation employment in any industry in the United Kingdom is, or Is likely to be, seriously affected.   If the Board are satisfied that a prima facie case is made out they must refer the complaint to a Committee, which has to consider not only if the conditions already mentioned are fulfilled, but also if the complainant industry in the United Kingdom is being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy,,   Unless they report that all these conditions are fulfilled the Board cannot make an order.   Further, the Committee must report on the probable effect of a duty on the goods complained of upon any industry using those goods as materials; and finally no order can be made by the Board which&apos;is at variance with any commercial treaty,   If the Board, after taking all the circumstances into account, decide to make an Order that Order must be expressly confirmed by a resolution of the House of Commons *The proviso as to commercial treaties mentioned in the preceding paragraph is of importance.   We have no commercial treaties in force with ex-enemy countries; with Italy there is a treaty which can be terminated only after 12 months&apos; notice; with Czecho-Slovakia there is a treaty which provides for three months1 notice being given of the proposed Imposition of a duty; with Belgium there is a modus vivendl terminable at three months2 notice; with Prance we have no treaty giving most-favoured-nation treatment In respect of Customs duties, but in fact we enjoy the lowest rates of duty by virtue of a special French law.   No duty under the provisions of the Act now in question could be imposed on goods produced in Italy. - in respect of which some complaints have been made * except by giving notice to terminate the Treaty and consequently after at least a year; though the period of notice in the case of Czecho-Slovakia and Belgium, as to which countries also complaints have been made,   the period of notice is much shorter, the possibility of retaliation by those countries cannot be left out of sight; and in the case of France, as* to which the worsted trade has particularly complained, if duties under these particular provisions of the Safeguarding of Industries Act were imposed on any of her products the most-favoured-nation treatment which we enjoy there could be, and probably would be immediately withdrawn,,   The Orders at present in force apply only to goods from Germany,
5, The reason for limiting the existing provisions ofPart II of the Act so far as they relate to &quot;depreciated currency dumping&quot; to three years from the 19th August, 1921, (the date eif the passing of the Act) was presumably the expectation that in three years the dislocation of European currencies would be remedied. This expectation has not been realised and there is a demand that the existing provision for safeguarding o\rr industries from such ^dumping&quot; should be continued; and that the machinery should be made more simple and expeditious.,   It. Is urged that even if Germany is becoming less formidable the competition of Erench, .&apos;  Belgian and Italian goods is increasing and will be stimulated by the recent depreciation of French and Belgium currencieso   There are then three possible alternative courses:-(a) to continue the provisions now in question as they stand;(b) to continue them with amendments; or(c) to allow them to lapse on the 19th August.Both the first and second of these courses would require legislation.   In the first case the legislation would be very controversial and Would only satisfy to a very limited extent those who asked for something to be done; and in the second case, though more satisfaction would be given to such persons, the legislation would necessarily be even more controversial.   I need hardly remind my colleagues of the Debate and Vote on Mr. &quot;;ardlaw^Milne! s motion on the 13th February and the vote on Mr. Remer&apos;s motion for leave to introduce a Bill to amend the Safeguarding of Industries Act on the 4th Marcho   In all the circumstances I recommend that the provisions of the Act which relate to &quot;depreciated currency dumping&quot; shall be allowed to lapse on the 19th August next and that an announcement of the Government^ intention in this respect should be made at an early date.6* In the event of such  (declaration being challengedin the House of Commons it could be defended on the grounds (a) that it cannot be demonstrated that any of the more important industries of the country are being seriously damaged by imports due to currency conditions and that the apprehensions of those who take a gloomy view of the immediate future may be no more realised than were similar apprehensions in the past;    (b) that the Government&apos;s policy Is so to further a re-settlement of Europe as to facilitate   the ultimate stabilisation of Continental Exchanges and so to deprive, foreign manufacturers of any abnormal competitive advantage which they may be enjoying; (c) that any attempt to impose differential duties which the Act contemplates on goods of countries where we at present enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment by virtue of commercial treaties terminable at short notice or simply by law
3 9^(as   In the case of Prance) would certainly give rise to retaliation, and that in other cases they could only he imposed after long notice which would in fact defeat their purpose; and (d) that the general policy of the Government is to remove barriers to trade and not to erect new barriers.7, Such a declaration may of course give rise to ademand for the repeal of the Safeguarding of Industries Act as a whole.   This of course involves legislation which would certainly be strongly contested and for which it Is obviously impossible to find time in the present Session.8. Under the late Government a Committee (not under the safeguarding of Industries Act) was appointed in July 1923, to enquire into the conditions of the Lace, Embroidery and Silk Industries, in view of the representations made alike by employers and operatives, and to report what action could be taken to improve the position.   In the casesof Lace (where the competition complained of Is mainly from Prance) and certain classes of Embroidery (where the competition is from Switzerland and Germany) the Committee of four unanimously , recommended the imposition of a duty of 33 V3!* on imports from all countries, but in regard to Silk the Committee was equally divided, two (including the Chairman) being against a protective duty, and two in favour of it.Effect could of course be given by the next Finance Bill to the recommendation of the Committee as to Lace and Embroidery, but the same considerations apply to this as to a prolongation of the depreciated exchange provisions of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, and I therefore recommend that an announcement be made to the effect that the Government do not see their way to adopt the recommendation of the Committee.s.&apos;W.Board of Trade. 8/3/24.
