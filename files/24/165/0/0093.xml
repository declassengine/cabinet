The&apos;Cabinet decided that the request for a grant from State Funds which had been made by a deputation received toy the Minister of health should.be refused. &apos; The decision concluded as follows-:-&quot;(d).   That the Secretary for Scotland should have, discretion if-he thought fit in view of the above Con-clusions to present a&apos;memorandum to the Cabinet in regard to. the case of Poor Law Authorities in necessitous areas in Scotland&quot;.I desire to submit to my colleagues the case of such Poor Law Authorities in Scotland..  The position ia briefly as follows.. - ...... ...... ........   ... ...(.,       ......., ,Until 1921 it was. a fundamental principle of the Scottish Poor Law that an able-bodied person was not entitled to relief.   Owing, however,&apos; to the prevailing widespread unemployment tne Poor&apos;Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1921, was parseda^poaing on&apos;&quot;Parish&apos; Councils the duty of providing&apos;relief to&quot;destitute able-bodied persons out of. employment.;- The-Act of 1921 which was.-a-temporary measure was continued &quot;by &quot;Section 3 of the&apos; Local^Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Act, &quot;1923.   The powers so. continued ercire on 15t.i kay   1924.&apos; . I have introduced a Bill to con-tinue them until loth Lay&apos;,&apos; 1925.... The Parish Councils nave been much, concerned about this addition to taeir.autiea-and burdens., They -nave loyally/carried out; the. vprov is ions, but &quot;they have con-stantly&apos; pr&apos;ess.ed:.f or a Government - grant &quot;oh., the-ground that the res-cons lb ility.&apos;for; &apos;ical&apos;ing with such&apos;a,.specialergency snouli.-.;.be -a. national; and &quot;not\&quot;a Idea sands&apos;; nave been, endorsed &quot;by &quot;development ore and;.suremerge denu-al one.   Their porters of thepresent Goverrmeiit as -veil as by Liberal Members of Parliament, especially during the passage of the Bills conferring and&apos;&apos; continuing, the powers.to.Yeiieye .the,ab bodied unemployed.&apos; .      ...&quot;,.&apos;-..,..&apos;.&quot; ;.\.:&apos;.:&quot;:&apos;.&quot;.&apos;la-The late Secretary,&quot;.for -Scotland&apos;..(Lord.. Nov^r): was in favour of &apos;a&apos; direct &quot;grant to &quot;Poor &quot;Law Authorities in&apos; &quot;Scotland. &quot; his views, however,-were not accepted by the . late Government who %ere -impressed, with the difficulty,of , makih--.. grants &quot;it:-Poor - Law - Authorities &quot;in. Scotland, and.5hot . in&apos;England and A/ales.&apos; The policy &quot;of&apos;ass 1st-in,--. Poor Law vAuthorities by-means of loans made &apos;:on the xecotoendatior.on of/&apos;
of the Gosouen Committee was continued   some modifications in detail being authorised in August, 19&apos;23^The demand for a&quot;Government grant was again put forward strongly by a deputation from Scottish Pariah Councils in tne chief industrial-districts which was received by the Minister of Labour and myself on the 21st February. &apos; At that interview the minister of Labour indicated-&apos;nut was being done and considered with regard to unemployment benefit and in particular the removal of &quot;gaps&quot;.    The deputation expressed their appreciation of these measures and admitted&quot; tnat- if the &quot;big gap&quot; were removed tnis would be   a considerable relief to&apos;them.   They, however, advanced figures showing tiie heavy burden which industrial parishes are bearing and pressed their demand for a grant.    They suggested a scale of grant-to which reference is made in paragraph 8 belo^. -They urged that the Bill which was to be introduced for the ourooae cf continuing; their powers should contain a Clause making provision for the&quot;payment of a grant from the &quot;Exchequer-.:..d:-      Uhile the rate of expenditure of the parish Councils is now lower than the exceedingly heavy rate   . which obtained last year, it&apos; remains a Heavy charge and I have great sympathy with their views.   There is ofcriously a &quot;difficulty in differentiating in the natter of a Government grant between the Parish Councils in Scotland and Boards of Guardians in England and Wales.   It is to be remembered, however, that the Act of IS 21 which pro-vided for relief to the able-bodied was a departure&quot;from the long established principles of tho Scottish Poor Law and that the adrainistratite machinery of the Pariah Council was never intended to deal with such&quot; an emergency aa. this and in some at least of the smaller parishes has. beer: stretichad  almost to breaking point.- - - There is also:a ; strong argument, for differentiation between the-two &apos;      -countries in the fact thst-nth few exceptions the &quot;area of the Parish in Scotland is considorably smaller than that of the Board of Guardians in England and /ales.Another factor of great importance ia that in Scotland unemployment is mostly concentrated in a few definite areas on which tne burden has pressed with exceptional severity.   Debt charges - in.&quot; respect of loans raised to meet the expenditure of thd past dohree years . represent in themselves a considerable&apos; burden on the rates without any addition in the form of curreao edpanditure. In ten parishes such loan charges range from 6d, to 1/6&amp;. in the  , on gross rental.    These will continue in some caaos for about ten years.The expenditure on the relief of the able-bodied is not tne only exceptional expenditure caused bv the * state of unemployment.   The number of persons relieved, under tne ordinary Poor Law provisions has greatly increased owing to the inability of unemployed, relatives tc continue to maintain them.   This represents a very considerable addition to the expenditure.
son0 O o&apos;The following Table gives the number of persons in receipt of Poor Relief at certain dates in Scotland and in England and Wales.   It will bo seen that the Scottish-figure has throughout been higher than the corresponding English figure.Number of Persons in receipt of Poor Relief at certain dates.(Population 4,882,49 7.)15th Jan. 1921,   94,088* 19.3 per 1,000 of pcpn. &quot;       1922 . 215,694 - 44,2   &apos;* 1923. 271,858 s 55.7 &quot; &quot;       1924. 255,050 - 52.2   &quot;       *&apos;        &quot;ENGLAND AND miM, (Population 37,855,242).lsrf -Jan. 0.923    663,667 s 1705 per 1,000 of popn,1922. 1,49-3,066 s 39.4   &quot;&quot;       1923.1.537,990 &quot; 40.6   &quot;29th Doc.   1923.1,355,000 - 35.8   &quot;       &quot; &quot;
mThe possibility of a measure for equalising monster a larger area the expenditure incurred by Parish Councils has been frequently considered but no satisfactory scheme has been found possible.   The fact that unemployment is largely concentrated in adjoining parishes makes&apos; it&quot; specially difficult to devise a workable scheme.8. At the recent deputation the Parish Councilssuggested that there should be an Exchequer grant of 50 per cent, or preferably 75 per cent, of their expenditure on the unemployed in excess-of the proceeds of a rate of 6d. in the  .   &quot; This matter has been independently considered by the Scottish Board of Health who have considered various alternative schemes of assistance which might be adopted if the principle were sanctioned.   They consider that the best scheme would be one providing for&apos; a grant of 50 per cent, of the expenditure in excess of a rate of 6d. in the  . on gross rental.      The cost of this for the local financial year ending 15th May  1925, is estimated at  250,000.   This is based upon&quot; the supposition that there-will be a considerable reduction in expenditure in 1924-5 as compared witn 1923-4 owing to the removal of the &quot;big gap&quot; and other causes.9. The question of an Exchequer grant will beraised on the Poor Law Emergency Provisions Continuance Bill of which I hope to take the Second Reading this week.   It will be neoessary either to state that a grant will bo given or tn give reasons for refusing a grant.   As I have indicated I think that there is a special case for making such a grant to Scottish Parish Councils and I would recommend a grant on the scale mentioned in the foregoing paragraph.    The exact terms and conditions can be worked out between tho Treasury and myself if a grant is sanctioned in principle, .ADAM80N&apos;.Scottish Office, tfnitehall,17th March, 1924.
