The Cabinet are reminded that the Unemployment Grants   Committee have always followed the policy of insisting on the use of home materials in schemes assisted by them for tho relief of unemployment subject to the proviso whereby if owing to theN.operations of a ring or otherwise, prices of Britishmaterials were greatly in excess of foreign materials^the use of the latter might be allowed.The Unemployment Committee recommend:-That the Unemployment Grants Committee should be authorised to adhere to their existing procedure as regards the use of imported materials on relief works *The Committee recommend(l)   That general arrproval should be given to the new  13&quot;, 500,000. Road and Bridge programme outlined in   C*U. 636 on the understanding that the Chancellor of the exchequer will examine with the Minister of Transport the question of the method by which the proposed new programme can best be financed, it being understood that this recommendation in no way precludes future discussion of the extent to which the proposed new road programme can best be   financed.(2)   That the Minister of Transport should be requested to limit his commitments on the major schemes within the shortest possible period so as to be in a position to defer schemes wholly or in part in the event of a substantial improvement in the Unemployment situation taking place.

Before reaching a decision tho Cabinet will no doubt have regard on the one hand to the alleviation of unemployment which would be afforded by the acceleration of Light Railway construction undertaken by the Railway Groups with Government assistance, and on the other hand to the grave political objections to special financial assistance being given by the Government to the Railway Groups.A3 a matter of urgency the Committee have authorisedBock.,the Minister of Labour formally to confirm the notifies-&apos;e) Tiijmrjr Works.tion (given orally by him in pursuanoe of a decision ofthe Committee) to a Grimsby deputation that on the factsbefore them the Government do not see their way to thegrant of financial assistance to the North&apos;-EasternRailway Company in respect of the construction of theGrimsby Fish Lock.The Committee request the Cabinet -To take note of and approve the action taken by the Committee in this matter,.That the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Transport should be authorised to interview the Port of London Authority and endeavour if possible to persuade the Authority to undertake the Tilbury works forthwith on Uneraploy-mant Grants Committee terms; suggesting that the Authority should approaoh the   * Unemployment Grants Committos and should undertake that the Government would give further consideration to the matter if it ultimately transpired that the Unemployment Grants Committee were unable to grant the Authority assistance on the usual termsi

Havingregard to the political and other considerations involved, the Committee have requested the Ministerof Transport:-To submit to the Cabinet a statement of the position regarding trunk road reconstruction from the transport point of view, the statement to deal fully with the question of the restora-tion of the scads in question and tho effect of such restoration on unemployment.6.

The Committee desire to draw attention to thefaot that oertain of the Departmental proposals raise questions of polioy on which Cabinet decisions willhereafter be required.   For example, the admiralty have proposed a programme of Naval Construction which,if adopted, would give employment to a large numberof men in the next three or four years in an industry which it Is otherwise extremely difficult to help andwhich programme is now being considered by anotherCabinet Committee.   The Forestry Commission suggest the full resumption of the   Forestry Aot 1919 planting programme,   The Ministry-of Transport&apos;s Trunk Roadreconstruction proposals to which reference has beenmade above, is another caso in point.There are also largo departmental building programmes submitted by the Post Office, the education and other Departments, the question cf the acceleration of whioh should, in the view of the Committee, be deferred ponding the progress of the Government^Housing Policy,.10.   The Committee oonour generally with the views expressed by tho Inter-Departmental Sub-Committee in*their Report (C.U. 656 attached) on-assistance to private enterprise and accordingly recommend the Cabinet to adopt the following oonolusions   of that Committee -
9 9 K(l)   That the extension of the present arrangements for assisting public Utility-Undertakings to ordinary private enter-prise is only practicable (from the point of view of providing substantial employment) if the Government are prepared to offer assistance to all forms and varieties of private enterprise without any restriction as to the nature of the work undertaken.   The adoption of such a policy is open to the gravest political, economic and financial objections and it is in the highest degree improbable that, even if adopted, unemployment would be permanently relieved or the publio interest safeguarded.(B)   That the question of removing the existing bar to assistance being   givsn to the Railway Groups, the only substantial publio utility undertakings which are at present ineligible for Government assistance, should bo considered after the results of the Conferences between Ministers and the Railways are known,OUT STABBING      11.   The Committee hope to be shortly in a position QUESTIONS.  -to report to the Cabinet on the following outstanding questions:-(l)   Juvenile Unemployment.(2)   The position in certain basic industries-(3)   Unemployment among women,(4)   The Railway Groups and Unemployment Relief Und ertakings.FUTURE 12,   vfhile the Committee in no way desire to restrictCOMMITMENTS.Departmental aotivity in promoting works in relief of unemployment they consider that great care should be taken in the oase of major schemes to limit the commitments of the Government within the shortest possible period so that the Government will be in a position to defer or even abandon schemes in the   event of a substantial improvement in the unemployment situation taking place.
Tho Committee accordingly recommendThat before definitely entering into major unemployment relief undertakings spread over a considerable period of time Departments concerned should take oare to secure the Government&apos;e commitments are limited within the shortest period compatible with efficiency and economy.13.The Committee recommend the CabinetTo authorise arrangements being made for the earliest possible announcement in Parliament of the proposals of the Government for the relief of unemploy-ment.

DAVIDS.Davids, oould suggest any way in which the furtherrelief of Unemployment could he facilitated.Public, Lord St. Davids reminded the Committee that theUtilityUndertakings arrangements for assisting Public Utility Undertakingshad only been approved last Summer and had only, recently become generally known; it rase quite possible that in the future Public Utility Companies Would make more use of the facilities than in the past.    If the arrangements now limited to Public Utility Companies could be extended to ordinary profit earning companies the volume of business done might increase enormously.    If the object of the Government was to relieve Unemployment it did not seem t* hin. very material whether the reliof was given through companies whose profits were limited by Statute    ; or companies whose profits were not so limited.Shin He, Lord St. Davids, wished to bring before theBulldlpg;,Committee a proposal relative to ship-building.    In the present depressed condition of the industry it was the object of ship builders to keep their yards open and abovo all to retain their key men.    In the past it had been the practice in similar times of depression for ship builders to speculate by building ships oi the ordinary utility type,  even though the speculation resulted in some loss.   He suggested that ship builders    j with empty yards should be pressed to start building . tramp steamers and if they declined to do so withoutIJhelp that the Government should offer to bear, say, &apos; three-quarters of the loss or to take one-half of-any profit resulting from the sale of a ship when built. The advantages of this arrangement were that work, would be provided at home in the iron, steel and coal trades
as well as in ship-building itself;   that the Government wuuld probably lose very little money and that Work could be started very quickly.   In conclusion Lord St. Davids informed the Committee that the late Government were disposed to favour the proposal.It was pointed out that the proposal would be strenuously opposed by the ship owners;   that other industries would certainly claim similar treatment and that there was roason to believe that the ship builders themselves would not favour the scheme inas-much as it would have the effect of deferring, almost indefinitely, the time when ship-building could bo profitably carried on.She Committee ar:reed:-That Lord St. Davids1 suggestions relating to the extension of assistance to ordinary profit earning companies and his scheme for assisting ship-building involved questions of policy which it would be necessary for the Cabinet to decide.20     The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum, C.U.642, by the Unemployment Grants Committee on works in hand and possible future development.Lord St. Davids reminded the Committee that the policy of accelerating works was a good policy if limited to say a period of one or two years, but if it was continued for four or five years it was open to seriotis objections inasmuch as the tendency was for local authorities to claim that all routine work was acoelerated work.     &quot;With regard to the present, financial conditions of assistance, he, Lord St, Davids, sould not recommend any increase in the present percentages. Ee, however, favoured the early issue of a circular to local authorities, supplemented by personal consultation by responsible officers with the authorities.
9 0 *?ej lord St. Davids also reminded the Committee that many schemes, very important from the point of view cf unemployment relief, were schemes which could only be carried out over a period of years, for example, Dfck Undertakings.   The present practice was that the Unemployment Grants Committee had discretion to approve schemes, the maximum duration of the work of which was two years, and could, with special Treasury sanction,-approve schemes, the duration of which would extend to four yeers.    In point of fact, assistance was *mly given to tho longer schemes when the area was a particularly distressed one from the Unemployment pointAfter some discussion the Committee agreed torecommend to the Unemployment Committee:-fl)   That no alteration should be made in the existing terms,  (for which see Appendix), of financial assistance given to local authorities and statutory bodies not working for profit.(2)   That the Unemployment Grants Committee v       should be authorised to assist schemes on the loan basis during the autumn and winter of 1924/25 up to a maximum value of  20,000,000 in addition to the schemes to be approved in the immediate future for which sanction has been already given up to  2,000,000.(3)   That the Unemployment Grants Committee should be authorised to assist schemes on the basis of 60$. of the wages c^st during the financial year 1924/25 to the additional extent of  250,000, this further amount to be accordingly provided for in the Committee&apos;s Estimate for 1924-/25.(4i   That the Unemployment Grants Committee should bo authorised, as in the past, to assist schemes at discretion, the carrying out of which would be effected in not more than two years and that this perird should be extended to not m^ro than four years in special eases * with Treasury sanction;    it being understood that the Unemployment. Committee would be favourably disposed to a liberal interpretation being placed by the Unemployment Grants Committee cn the exercise of their discretion in the matter of schemes, the duration of which will not exceed two years.
9C?3.     With referenct to C.U. 74 U), Conclusions, Minute 4, the Committee, had before, them a Memorandum by the Unemployment Grants Committee (C.U. 643) and also a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (C.U.629J. on the restrictive conditions subject to the -fulfil -ment of which grants are at present made by the   -&apos; Unemployment Grants CommitteefeThe Committee were reminded that this condition was Imposed by the Unemployment Grants Committee at the initiation of its work in December,- 1920, ana that it ap^lios only to workmen   employed on the-spot and not to those in factcries engaged in the preparation . of the materials for the work.    The main objects &apos;qf &apos;tks condition are to enable a check to be kept as to Jthe rbservunce of the conditions of grant during the progress of the work, and to prevent abuse of the grants.   The -condition also enables the Unemployment $-rants C^mnflttee and the Government auditors effectively to satisfy themselves that the grant h;;s been fairly earaedkIt is also important that the condition should be maintained in order to secure,that looal labour is employed and the needs of the locality to which the grant is made thus relieved.   The condition also- prevents men frcm being attracted to relief work from other works and j also secures&quot;that due consideration is,given to cases of personal hardship in the selection of applicants from among the local unemployed.Finally, the Committee were informed that theteis little or no justification fer the allegation thatjustifiesthe existence of the condition      /     contractors in increasing th-sir prices,
The Unemployment Grants Committee used their discretion in applying the condition;and have frequentlyallowed direct engagements where (l) suitable men arenot available at the Employment Exchange, or iZ) wherea few men of special typo for a partioulsr job areheaded;&apos;.The Committee agreed:--To recommend to the Unemployment Committee that no alteration be made in the existing arrangements relative to the recruitment&apos;&quot; of labour- through the local Employment Exchange.Slgreferencg The Committee were reminded that under their Q-3x&quot;S rviceMen. Treasury minute on appointment, dated 20th December, 1920,the Unemployment Grants Committee were instructed to observe inter alia the, following general principle in sanctioning grant?;;- for public works .-The Committee had accordingly imposed the followingcondition of grant -&quot;All labour must be engaged through the JfriplpymentlsohanKQ,^iQ,h will give prjfjr^gj^to^^ggryioeIfeeSi&quot;      ,. -As a result of experience it was subsequently agreedthat the preference should take the form of stipulating that 7.5$ of the labour engaged should be Ex-Service men and that tho Unemployment Grants Committee should have discretion to modify this condition where hardship is entailed.    In the result the percentage of preference has been reduced generally to 50$.Tho Committee were also informed that no difficulty had been found in administering the condition and that tho form;;! observance  -i&apos; the preference is very jealously
9 0 fl.watched hy representatives nf the ife-Service men,who will strenuously oppose any attemptto modify theexisting arrangements.The Committee agreed:-To recommend to the Unemployment Committee that no alteration should be mado in the present arrangements unfler&apos;which, while normally not Less than 75 per cent of the men employed on relief works shall be fix-Servico men, the Unemployment Grants Committee may modify the requirement as they think fit.Ipayment ^i        Tha Committee were informed that this condition tipduoedPFSJL-to   had been originally imposed by the Unemployment Grants Skilledm, during Committee as the result of an instruction given by the ja Proba-Unemployment Committee to the Cabinet in Octobor 1921.Pering.In theory the rate of wages paid must not exceed75 per cent of the Local Authorities own rate forunskilled labour for a probationary period -jf sixmonths and the condition only applies to labour directlyemployed.   &quot;Various modifications have, however, been introduced which have the effect of restricting theerudition to whole time applicants who have never beforeworked on relief schemes and who are &quot;unskilled labourers&quot;.Among ether suggestions it was proposed by theMinister of Labour that the wording of the conditionshould be altered so as to read -&quot;That the wages to be paid on relief works carried out directly must net exceed these normally paid by the Local Authority to its own workmen cn similar classes of work&quot;.It was, however, pointed &quot;ut that this wordingwould enable men on relief works tn be paid at a higher rate than the &quot;district rate&quot; where the Authority&apos;rate exceeded the district rate.
9l!&amp; v o uThe Committee agreed:-To request the Unomployment Grants Committee,, in consultation with the-Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour, to draft, for the consideration of the Committee, a formula on the general lines of that proposed by the Minister of Labour.4) Cer^f-publication The Committee were informed that by the termso.LJ.irioiisUnemployment      of the Treasury Minute of Appointment &quot;iiorks will fey, 1ftp Ministry    ,SiSEt he approved only in areas where the existence of serious unemployment, which is not otherwise provided for, is certified by the Ministry of Labour&quot;.The condition was imposed to secure that the Financial assistance from the Exchequer should be allocated to areas which had moat need of it and that experience had not shown that the existence cf the condition prevents the use of the grant-making machinery in any case where there is a reasonable claim for Exchequer assistance.    The need for continuing the condition as a method of rationing the money available depends on the rala-tion between the value cf the schemes proposed and the ampunt of money provided.   Any imprevement in the existing terms would probably necessitate some rationing rationing system, in which ease a scheme based on the amount of unemployment in the area is probably the letst open to objection.   As a rule the Ministry cf Labour grant a Certificate if the percentage of unomployment is six per cent or more, v      The following suggestions were considered by the Ce. mittee: -(l)   To abolish the condition altogether and to putnothing in its place. ( )   To retain the certificate as to unemploymentin the area as one important factor in deciding
whether .tho grant is to be made, but not to make it an essential condition of the grant that tho certificate should be given - in other words, the Unemployment Grants Committee, or the Ministry of Transport, could in proper cases make the grant even though a certificate cannot be given.(3)   To substitute for tho certificate an&apos; arrangement under which before a grant is givon the Minister of labour would have to satisfy hires elf that the scheme is one with which it is expedient to proceed immediately for the purpose of relieving unemployment [whether locally or elsewhere).The Committee were informed that the Unemployment,Grants Committee consider     that the Ministry of labourstating that should give a certificate \ /     the total number of unemployed persons in a district in question is a givon number and that this is equivalent to a given percentage of the insureble population sf tho district.   The Unemployment Grants Committee would, then have before them the necessary information on whioh to consider the position without tying their hands a3 at present by a certificate.The Committee agreed:--Committee   the retention of the Certificate as to Unemployment in the area as one important factor in deciding whether the grant is .. to bo made but not to make tho giving of the Certificate an essential condition of a grant by&quot;the Unemployment Grants Commit! ivinistrv of Transport.
The 0ommit tee agreed;-To request the Unemployment Grants Ocmaittee in consultation, as necessary with the Departments concerned, tc submit to the Unempioyment Committee a revised draft&apos;, of the various conditions which should he prepared with a view to the publio being informsd% , so far as practicable, of the exact nature of the conditions under which assistance is given by the Unemployment Grants Committee.9  5 Vj4.

In this connection the Sub-Committee desire to draw attention to the future difficulties which will arise in cases where  &apos; unemployment relief schemes, extending over several years,CAB I N El.
t) jfjj ov.; &apos;t* 0have &quot;been begun on the strength of Government financial assistance, should unemployment materially decrease,.. In tho view of the Sub-Committee it is very important that Departmental commitments on Important schemes of this character should be limited within the shortest possible period so as to enable the schemes to be deferred, either wholly or in part, should the unemployment situation undergo substantial improvement.The schemes specified in List &quot;B&quot; are schemes which, after careful consideration, Departments have felt able to recommend.   Other schemes, some of which are at present of a nebulous character, have been brought to the notice of the Sub-Committee, but the Departments concerned have not been able, for good and adequate reasons, to recommend serious consideration being given to them at the moment, .In List &quot;C&quot; will be found a--number of schemes and proposals Which require decisions of the Cabinet before they can be further considered in detail.   It is only necessary for the Departmental Sub-Committee to draw attention to the grave political issues Involved in sanctioning proposals such as &quot;the wide extension of Exchequer assistance to private enterprise&quot;, while, at the same time, stating their view that a grant of such assistance might materially relieve the unemployment problem.It will, of course, be recognised that some of the proposals in the Lists relate to work which would, in any event, have been undertaken arid which have little or no reference to special unemployment relief, e.g. the Fighting. Services orders.   At the same time it must be recognised that the acceleration of this work directly relieves un-emyloyment and. has, in addition, the great advantage of employing men in their own trades.

(ISIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.3 ECU E T 0.17&quot; 656.0 A B I B E T .UNEMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE,ASSISTANCE TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE,&quot;SPORT.At their Meeting on February 21st.,1924, (C.U.75 (B) Conclusions-2, the Unemployment Sub-Committee requested the Inter-Departmental Sub-Committee to re-examine tho question of the possible extension of the present arrangements for assisting Public Utility Undertakings to ordinary private enterprise, and to report to the Unemployment Committee whether it would be practicable to extend the arrangements to certain classes of Companies, e.g. Railway Companies, and, if so, whether steps could be taken effectively to safeguard the public interest.The question of relieving unemployment by assisting private enterprise has in the past been brought before the Unemployment Committee on numerous occasions and in a great variety of forms.     Speaking generally it may be said that until the Summer of 1923 tho settled policy of successive Administrations was to refuse to entertain proposals for directly assisting private enterprise by meansof cash grants or payments, while offering under strict supervision and conditions, facilities through theExport Credits and Trade Facilities arrangements,The policy  so adopted and maintained was one which could be logically and politically defended, while, at the same time the Exchequer was safeguarded against excessive claims.     In the years following the after-war bo em great
:.j A. 0pressure was put upon the Government to relieve unemployment by keeping trade and industry at work but it was always recognise:  at that time that the policy of manufacturing for stock was one which would in the end merely aggravate the problem, and that quite apart from financial considerations the host policy was to encourage normal trade recovery and to alleviate distress through relief measures supplemented by unemployment benefit.In the summer of 1923 it was thought desirable by certain Ministers to extend the existing arrangements in the direction of helping private enterprise, and after considerable discussion the unemployment Committee, in their Report dated 2nd July, 1923,  (G.P.302 (23),) after making certain Recommendations respecting assistance to local Authorities, laid before the Cabinet the following proposals regarding Public Utility Undertakings and Private enterprise.&quot;III.   ;;poeleration of Works of other Undertakers. (11)     Tho Committee have considered whether and if so how far assistance similar to that recommended in the preceding section of this Report can be extended to bodies other than local authorities who can be stimulated to place additional orders in the very near future and they recommend that grants, on the same basis and the same conditions as those recommended, should be made available tc (a) public todies, that is, any Board, Commission, Rating authority, or Trustees or other body of persons who manage or* undertake work in pursuance of statutory power, not being a body trading for profit;
9 i. .53&quot;(b) undertakings of the same nature as those carried on by public bodies but trading for profit:?roviled that in the case of undertakings conducted by companies for private profit, the* dividends of which are not limited by Statute, the . Unemployment Grants Committee shall be required to impose as a term of the grant(a) that the division of tho profits of the Company by way of dividends ?r bonus shall be limited in such manner and for such period normally as the Committee may prescribe, or (b)   That the grant or such part thereof as the Committee may prescribe shall be repaid on such conditions as may be determined by the Committee, and that, failing fulfilment of the conditions so imposed, the whole grant shall be repayable on demand. It would be necessary to exclude railway companies from the application of the grant,IfitThese recommendations wore accepted by the Cabinet on the 4th and 9th July, 1923, subject only to the following alteration of the proviso to (a) above-&quot;TJvt the division of profits of tho Company by way of dividends or bonus shall normally be restricted for tho period of the loan, and that only in exceptional cases should the Committee relax this condition by imposing the restriction for a period, less than the period of the loans&quot; In ooptember, 1923, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued the circular giving the conditions subject
to which the Committee were prepared.to assist Public utility undertakings.     In this circular it was laid down that $SA&quot;The works in respect of which assistance is . desired must bo of a public utility character,e.g. Gas, water&apos;and&apos;Electricity, tramways, docks, harbours and canals.&quot;At the outset, the assistance was limited to a maximum of fifty per cent of the interest on the capital raised normallyfor the/period during which the capital expenditure wasunremuneratlve.     Later in the year, however, arrangements were made under which, in certain cases, the interest paymentscould he commuted for a capital sum down,It will he observed that the extension of assistanceto private enterprise allowed by these arrangements was of adefinite and limited character.     In the first Place, railwayundertakings were excluded for special financial reasons and because of their favourable position under the railway, settlement and pot because they are not Public Utility Undertakings. Moreover,Railway Companies in the oast have often taken a broad, viewof their responsibilities and have carried out extensions anddevelopments which perhaps were not fulky remunerative in them-selves but which they felt themselves called upon to carry outowing, to their semi-Dublic responsibilities&apos;.     It would bepreoisely works of this kind (e.g. extensions of branch lines intosemi-developed rural districts) which the railway companies might perhaps bring to the Unemployment Grants Committee and it would be most regrettable if the railway companies got into the habit oflooking to the Government to help them to carry out works -vhichin the past they have on the whole been prepared to carry outthemselves.     In the second elace, speaking generally, assistance was only to be given to those Companies which carried on works of a character similar to those undertaken by Local Authorities.    Inthe third Plac^, the Public Utility Undertakings were not to be restricted to those whose profits are limited by statute, and itsea loft to the Unemployment Grants Committee to secure&apos;by regulationthat the assistance given did not go directly in increase of orofits.a$r than Li^ht Railways which the Unemployment Grants Committee a. and do, assist.
9 *M&quot;.* fj -iThe condition actually imoossd by the Committee was as follows:-The undertaking will normally be required to submit to such limitations as to the distribution of profits, etc, during the period of assistance as may be necessary to&quot;secure, in the opinion of the Committee, that no undue advantage is taken of such assistance.     Each case will, in this respect, be considered separately upon its merits.As the Unemployment Committee have already been informed, the response to these Public Utility arrangements has not been as great as was anticipated^ this is said, to be attributable to insufficient advertisement of the advan-tages offered, but another cause, of failure may be that there are not in existence in the country any considerable.number of schemes which can benefit by these grants,The fjrst question which arises in connection with any extension of the Present field of assistance is one. which has been found insoluble in the past, namely, how to draw any line which could be logically and politically defended and maintained between Companies which are and Companies which are not to be assisted.     So long as Government assistance is limited, to undertakings similar to those frequently operated by Local Authorities, and provided reasonable precautions are taken to guard the taxpayer against abuse, the practical objections to the present scheme ar^e not so serious but the moment the scheme is extended to Companies carrying on activities other than those open to Local Authorities, it is submitted that &quot;in practice it will be found impossible, politically and administratively, to restrict the field of assistance, and that the shipbuilder whotwiahed to&apos;keep his yard rroing and the millowner who wished to keep his looms working would have to be given identical treatment.     If this premise is accepted, it follows that the extension of the scheme to private enterprise would inevitably result, inveryjnany cases, in the encouragement of the / &apos;:
manufacture of commodities for which there is at present no market, followed by the disastrous economic oonureguenpes of such action. nMoreover tho existence of schemes of Government assist-ance is probably even now having the effect of encouraging promoters not to proceed immediately with work- which they would normally carry out unaided.   Any hint of further Government assistance is oertain to postpone the day when trade resumes its normal activities with its own resources.The,financial effects of a decision to extend generally to private enterprise the existing terms of assistance to Public Utility Companies, might be very serious. Either the conditions would have to be comparatively light, in which case the calls on the Exchequer would be very heavy; or the conditions would have to be onerous, in wfiich appears little employment v/ould result, and an important principle wotild have been sacrificed without any political or economic, advantages.Tho question whether Railway Companies should be freely admitted to the terms given to ordinary Public.... Utility Companies raises a somewhat different issue, and the best course would appear to be to defer consideration of this question until $fter the conferences, which it is understood Ministers propose to have with the various Railway Groups.Having regard to the considerations indicated above, the Inter-Departmental Ccmmittee consider that the question put by the Unemployment Sub-Committee should be answered as fallows:-(l)   That the extension of the present arrangements for, assisting Public Utility Undertakings to ordinary private enterprise is only practicable (from the point of view Qf providing substantial employment) if the Government are prepared it. offer&apos; assistance to all forms and varieties qf private enterprise without any restriction as&quot; to the nature of the work undertaken.   The adaption ?.  such a policy is open to the gravest political, economic &quot;and financial ecieotions and it is in the highest deg?ea improbable^tnat, ^ven If adopted, unemployment would be permanently relieved or the public interest safeguarded.
(S)   That the Question of removing the existing bar to assistance being given to the Railway Groups, the only substantial public utility undsrtaicings which are at present ineligible for Government assistance, ehould be considered, after the results of the Conference between Ministers and the Railways axe known.999C 0(Signed)     WILLIAM GRAHAM.(R.3-H0W0RTH)jned I(0.W.G.BADT,Joint ISeoretaries.Chairman,l&apos;nter-dep artmental Sub-Committee.3 Whitehall Gardens, B.W.(l) &apos; S5th February -1984,
