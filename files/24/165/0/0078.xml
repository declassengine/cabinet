p. dfis Document is the Property of vessels. ,&apos;Blfl.tannlo ,Ma,tasty&apos;s Government.Qaoinet.Memorandum by the Minister of Health on the Report of the Unemployment Committee, (CP.143(24)).ht.pl(24).Copy Ho, * 0In connection with the first recommendation to the Cabinet from the Unemployment Committee in their Report (CP. 148(24)) on Juvenile Unemployment, viz;    that provision should be made by legislation for the extension of Unemployment Insurance to boys and girls from the date on which they first begin to work for wages, I desire to call the particular attention of my colleagues to the statement on pages 3 and 4 of the Report of the Juvenile Unemployment Sub-Committee (C.U. 650) as to the possible reaction of the proposal on the Health Insurance Scheme.IThe extension of Unemployment insurance to boys and girls between 14 and 16 years of age should logically involve a 3imilar extension in- the case of Health Insurance, but I am convinced that such extension would give, rise, to great difficulties and that any proposals to that end would meet with serious opposition not only from&apos; employers but also from the Friendly Societies..I think this should be bo me in mind in considering the advisability of submitting to Parliament proposals for the suggested extension of Unemployment insurance,I need not say that I am in sympathy with the objects aimed at by the Minister of Labour in this matter, though, as Minister of Health, I am bound to putyon record the repercussions of hia particular proposal on National.Insurance.nistry of Health. March 11th, 1924.(Intd)   j.?/.
