v 1 j I... uO(This document is the property/ of His Britannic Majesty^ Government. )SECRET.CP. 177 (24).C A B I N E T.HOME   AFFAIRS   COMMITTEE.NORTHERN- IRELAND LAND BILL.)memorandum by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet in their conclusions of the 13th February included amongst the Bills which might be given early introduction the Northern Ireland Land (Purchase) Bill, and I circulate a draft of the Bill herewith.The Bill is based.on the recommendations of Lord Eustace Percy1s &quot;Committee.   The late Government was pledged to introduce this Bill and it was mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech.The financial burden imposed by the Bill will be borne ultimately by the Exchequer of Northern Ireland, and the Bill was drafted by the last Government in close consultation with the Government of Northern Ireland, who are still anxious that the Bill should be proceeded with.  .The landlords of Northern Ireland would, I am told, generally be prepared to accept it as a fair settlement, but the tenants, who agreed to the proposal in 1918, now regard it as not sufficiently generous,- since the tenant in the Free State has been given better terms.The proposal I made in my Memorandum CP.59 (24) was that the Bill should be introduced on the understanding that if it proves controversial it will not be proceeded with.    Accordingly, I now ask authority to introduce the Bill in the form of the draft attached.A. HiHth March,  1924.
