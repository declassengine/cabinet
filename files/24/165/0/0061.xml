[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet,SECRET.CP. 159 (24).CABINET.IRAQ : REPORTED TURKISH ACTIVITIES ON NORTHERN FRONTIER.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a letter from the Air Ministry giving cover to an A.ir Staff Memorandum on the subject of reported Turkish activities on the Northern frontiers of Iraq. I also circulate three recent telegrams from the High Commissioner for Iraq on the same subject.I am examining in consultation with the Foreign Office and Air Ministry the practical proposals made in Sir H. Dobbs&apos;s telegrams Nos. 103 and 104 for countering Turkish propaganda. I do not wish to trouble the Cabinet with that. But I am anxious that my colleagues should know how matters stand. It is. clear that the Turks will carry on an active propaganda throughout the frontier negotiations, and will do their best to keep both ourselves and the people of Iraq in a state of constant apprehension as to their intentions. We may expect frequent rumours of military concentrations and impending attacks, all designed to frighten us out of our firm attitude on the frontier question. There is little evidence, however, that these alarmist rumours are likely to take practical shape, or that anything in the nature of serious military action by the Turks is really to be apprehended. I am anxious to warn my colleagues in advance, in order that they may be able to discount the wild stories that are certain to reach their ears during the course of the negotiations.It is of course impossible to be quite certain that such rumours are entirely without foundation, and the situation will be carefully watched for any indication of the possibility of genuine trouble or danger..T. H. T.Colonial Office, March 5, 1924.h l.&apos;Air Ministry. Adastral House, (S.18081/S.6.) Kingsway, London, W.C.%Sir, - February 20, 1924.WITH reference to Colonial Office letter of the 16th January, 1924, 62284/23, and recent correspondence respecting the settlement of the Northern frontier of Iraq, I am commanded by the Air Council to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, that they anticipate that during the forth-coming frontier negotiations various and persistent rumours emanating from Turkish sources may be expected regarding the movement of Turkish troops and the possibility of Turkish attacks. Such rumours, together with other forms of propaganda will be designed to disturb the deliberations of the Conference, to unsteady the Government of Iraq, and still more to cause unrest amongst the inhabitants.Such rumours have, in fact, already commenced, and I am to enclose a memorandum upon the subject which has been prepared by the Air Staff.The Council consider it necessary to bring this matter to the attention of the Secretary of State in order that he may be prepared to take such action as he may deem necessary.I am, &amp;c.J. A. WEBSTER.The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S\W. 1.[11339]
Notes on Turkey and the Mosul Question.1. Reported Turkish Concentration on Jazirah Front.NUMEROUS reports, all from Turkish sources, have recently announced large Turkish concentrations and movements towards the Jazirah front. When analysed these reports appear to have no solid foundation, apart from the movement of one cavalry division from the West front towards Mardin. This has coincided with the reduction of the battalions per regiment in the only infantry division in the Jazirah area from three to two, which certainly does not indicate an increase of troops. The total rifle strength in the Diarbekir Army Corps area is by no means unduly large, especially when the unruly nature of the Kurdish inhabitants of this district is considered.It can be said that at the moment no&apos; concentration has taken place, but that Turkish propaganda regarding their intention to occupy the Mosul Vilayet has been greatly in evidence.2. Turkish Intentions.It is difficult to analyse Turkish intentions, and great care will be necessary in the near future in the examination of all rumours as to Turkish movements and reinforcements in the Jazirah area. It must be emphasised, however, that bluff and propaganda are to be expected from Turkish quarters, to whose advantage it is to create a feeling of anxiety and insecurity amongst the tribes of Northern Iraq and among the supporters of Feisal&apos;s Government.It must be remembered that Turkey is pledged to maintain the status quo pending the negotiations with Great Britain on the frontier, which, we maintain, were commenced on the 5th October, 1923. These negotiations are allowed to run for nine months by the Treaty of Lausanne, i.e., until the 5th July, 1924, by which time, if no agreement has been reached, the matter is to be referred to the League of Nations. It is unlikely that Turkey would break this pledge in opposition to the attitude of Great Britain, though it is quite possible that she would feel no compunction at engineering unrest in Iraq and doing everything possible to influence the present negotiations.3. Conclusion.It would appear that Turkish action will be limited to  (a.) An increase in false reports;(6.) Propaganda, and intrigue among the disloyal elements in Iraq; and (c.) Possibly further slight increases of Turkish troops on the Jazirah front to back their bluff.-These conclusions are given, however, with all due reserve, as owing to the speed with which the political situation changes from day to day, it is difficult to make an accurate forecast.It has of course been assumed in the foregoing remarks that the present Government are going to adhere to the present policy as laid down with regard to Iraq.Air Staff, February, 1924.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated February 29.Priority. No. 103 of the 29th February.RECENTLY there have been various indications showing that Turks may have in contemplation on Mosul frontier a repetition of policy which they pursued last year towards Syria, i.e., sending organised plundering bands or chettas across the frontier to create unrest and bring pressure to bear on us during the Mosul discus-sions. Colour is given to this idea by the despatch of cavalry regiment to Jazirah, by the throwing out near the frontier of certain new posts and the reported boasts of Turkish commander there and other Turkish officials that they intend taking Mosul by force.
Certain of our officials have been definitely warned by French Intelligence officers that this policy is believed by thern to be contemplated by Turkey. It is most important politically in my opinion that no handle should be given to the Turks by counter moves on our part to say that we are threatening aggression. No one believes, of course, that the Turks would do more than try to create perturbation and unrest among the civil population. It is, however, considered essential by Air Officer Commanding that Iraq forces and police should immediately co-operate with Imperial forces now at Mosul, such as the armoured cars, Air Force and levies, in manoeuvres designed to practice operations for checking Turkish bands. In this way if our fears are justified it may be known beforehand by all concerned precisely what measures are to be taken. I accordingly recommend that the Turkish Govern-ment be officially informed immediately that combined manoeuvres are about to be undertaken in area north-west of Mosul in view of the recurring seasonable danger of tribal unrest. It should be added that they have no military or political significance. Until receipt of your reply manoeuvres will not be undertaken.  Dobbs. __________Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated February 29.No. 104 of the 29th February. Urgent.ON the 5th February it was reported from Mosul that posts had been established by Turkish garrison of Jazirah at Girikara, 37/20 N., 42/10 E.; Demirkapu, 36/55 N., 41/50E.; and Dugeura, 37/03 N, 41/27E. Correct names are Girigira, Demirqapu and Dogir, and references are to Maunsell, 1/250,000, sheets 26, 31 and 25.This report is confirmed bv later information regarding last two plaoes. All three are well south of road from J azirah to Nisibin, and are, therefore, according to Franco-Angora Agreement and Treaty of Lausanne, in French Mandated territory. French Government should, I suggest, be urged to enter a protest immediately.I presume that a protest could also be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, if considered desirable, on the ground that this is a forward military movement, likely to disturb Mosul and status quo. Please refer to report No. 15 of the 28th January to Foreign Office from Consul at Aleppo, which mentions movements of Turkish troops through Syrian territory on Baghdad Railway. This small move cannot in itself, I consider, form ground for protest. I suggest, however, that French Government &apos;s attention might be invited to correspondence ending with Lord Curzon&apos;s letter to M. de Montille, E 12924/1/44 of the 25th November, 1921, enclosed in Colonial Office Confidential despatch of the 1st December, 1921, and that they might be asked for a definite assurance that, in the event of the Turks beginning to concentrate troops on frontier of Iraq in such strength as to cause tribal unrest, they will refuse at our request to allow further Turkish troops to pass over Baghdad Railway section between Maidan Ekbez and Choban Bey.This refers to my immediately preceding telegram. Dobbs.Paraphrase of telegram from High Commissioner for Iraq to Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.No. 118 of the 4th March, 1924.   Urgent. FOLLOWING reports now received : Beyond a grain dump (unconfirmed), there is no post at Dugir. Cavalry regiment, collecting supplies, visited Demir Qapu, but there is no post there. Reports received from several sources on several occasions of a post at Girigira; also, posts at following places: Mogelan, 2 miles north-east ^f Girigira; Hanawiyah, south of Girigira, on the Tigris; Pilisi, on the Safwan-Dere, 2 miles west of the Tigris; and Kharab Rashid. Mustafawiyah, about 15 miles from Jazirah, on road to Nisibin, is said to be headquarters of these posts, all of which are in territory under French mandate. French troops visited the area last August, but it is not in effective French occupation. Reference is invited in this connection to a telegram of the 25th April, 1923. from Air Ministry to A.O.C.This is in continuation of my telegram No. 104.-Dobbs.
