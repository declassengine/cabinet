IMPERIAL WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY COMMITTEE, 1924.REPORT. .The Rt. Hon. VERNON HARTSHORN, O.B.E., M.P.; His Majesty&apos;s Postmaster-General.1. We have been asked &quot; to consider and advise on the policy to be adopted as regards the Imperial Wireless Services so as to protect and facilitate public interests.&quot; It was impressed upon us that the question was urgent. We did not feel called upon to explore the past or to comment on the delays which have occurred in the building of the Empire Wireless Chain. We concentrated our attention on essential matters, examining and considering the facts and circumstances which have a direct bearing on policy and the conditions which safeguard public interests.2. A vast amount of evidence in existence was placed before us; reports, correspondence, records, explanatory data bearing upon our inquiry. We have also made special investigations to make our information as complete as possible. In order to finish our task in the time expected some of our members have been at work continuously in collating, analysing material, and preparing our report.3. We set forth briefly in supplements to our Report the various declarations of policy which have been made by successive Governments on Empire Wireless; also a selection of statements from evidence and reports explanatory of the present situation in this country and abroad which have been before us.Oversea Dominions and Wireless.4. When it was found that the original all-Empire wireless policy would not be carried out the chief self-governing Dominions took independent action, so that the construction of an all-Empire chain is not now possible.5. Awiralia. The Commonwealth of Australia, which led the defection, was influenced by its determination to have direct communication with England. It did. not accept the limitations put on the possibilities of long.distance wireless by the recommen-dations of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee of 1920. It objected to be the end of a chain made up of several links. Another factor in deciding Australian wireless policy was that a favourable proposal for carrying out a scheme was received from MarconVs Wireless Telegraph Company, Ltd. The Australian Government has entered into an agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd. an associated Marconi Company to provide the main trunk stations, in Australia and the United Kingdom and to arrange for the erection within two years of
a station&apos;rin1 Canada&quot; capable &quot;of &quot;comTnunicating:.:with;Atistraiia: A contract has been placed with the Marconi Company for building the Australian station. The&apos;Australian Government hold 500,001 out of the 1,000,000 ordinary shares in the Wireless Company.6, South Africa.-Th&amp;- Union Government, has entered into an agreement with the Marconi Company- under which a National South African Company is organised which will build and operate a wireless station for communication with&apos;England&apos;and the rest of the world. The Union Government keeps general control and has made provision for purchase at intervals of ten years.7. Canada. The Government of Canada has issued a licence to the Canadian Marconi Company for the erection of a high power station at Vancouver, aiid another at Montreal-the latter in place of the present station at Glace&apos; Bay-both capable of being used as parts of the Australian system for communicating with England if direct communication breaks down,8. India. The Government of India desired communication direct with England instead of having messages re-transmitted via Cairo, and has now invited tenders for the erection of its stations from a company which must be national in character and in financial control.9. New Zealand and Newfoundland. It is understood that the New Zealand Government intends to erect its own wireless station. The Government of Newfoundland has taken no action. It is quite easy for Newfoundland to link up with Canadian stations without erecting a high-power station of its own.[Puller particulars of the arrangements made by the Dominions will be found in supplements to this report.]Public Opinion in the Dominions.10. The Dominion Governments regarded wireless as the cheapest and . quickest means of&apos; communication, the only alternative and supplementary service to cables which they considered as inadequate. The main impelling influence of their action has been the conviction that wireless will improve Empire unity by bringing the people of the British Commonwealth closer together in good understanding and mutual friendship. Wireless they regard as the victory of science over space, as it annihilates distance.11. The people of. the Dominions were also disappointed to find that news and propaganda matter reaching distant British possessions and Par Eastern countries came from foreign services and that visitors sailing from the Antipodes had to rely on foreign wireless for news, until their ships came within range of the British stations. .   .  . ;&quot;12. These are among the considerations-which have actuated the Dominion&apos; Governments and caused among them a \ certain
measure of impatience if not irritation at the..delays* in the construction of the Empire Wireless Chain. The strong demand for an urgent settlement of.policy was expressed by Mr. Bruce, Prime Minister of Australia in a statement, which he made before leaving this Country in January last. (See footnote.)Variation in the Policy of the Beitisii Government.13. When wireless telegraphy reached the stage of development which made it a practical new means of communication the Government of the day in 1911 laid down the principle that Empire wireless should be owned&apos; and operated by the State. This policy was not departed from until Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s declaration of 5th March 1923.14. Reasons for Change. The Prime Minister then stated in the House of Commons that it &quot; was not considered necessary any longer to exclude, private enterprise from participation in wireless telegraphy within the Empire, and that the Government were ready to issue licences for wireless stations in this Country for communication with the Dominions, Colonies and foreign countries subject to the conditions necessary to secure British control and suitable arrangements tor the working of the traffic.&quot; Mr. Bonar Law also stated that &quot; in the interests of national security &quot; there should be a wireless station owned and operated by the State capable of communicating with the Dominions and to this extent there mrould be competition. The reason given by Mr. Bonar Law for the new course he recommended was &quot; the development in the science of wireless and other circumstances which had arisen.&quot;Footnote: The Right Hon. S. M. Bruce, Prime Minister of Australia, said: &quot; There must be more than one station in Britain, tho Post Office has said so, and the Australian Government has also said so. At the present moment, however, because of the dispute between the British Post Office and the Marconi Company, there is no prospect of more than one station being erected in-Britain, and unless definite action is taken wireless communication throughout the Empire will be seriously handicapped.&quot; The time has now come when a decision&apos; must be made. .-. two courses are open to the British Government. Either the Post Office should come to an arrangement with the Marconi Company, whereby Marconi&apos;s will be&apos;given a licence to erect a station or stations in-this country, any arrangement thus made to be submitted to Parliament for consideration and approval; or, if the Post- Office cannot come to such an arrangement,. a definite announcement should be made to the public showing why the protracted negotiations with Marcbni&apos;s have broken down. Tho public will then be in a position to allocate the blame, Jf it be definitely determined that a licence is not to-be granted.to Marconi&apos;s, the people of Britain, and certainly the people of the rest of the Empire, who are dependent upon wireless communication, should be told what policy is to be pursued, in order to provide the further wireless stations which are imperatively. required.&quot; ..   &apos;Extract from the Daily Telegraph, 5th January 1924..   .
15. Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s declaration involved two variations in policy; (1) that private enterprise was to participate in Empire wireless in England, and (2) that there would be an element of competition in the Service.16. Before this announcement was made the Marconi Company had, either directly or through affiliated companies, entered into agreements, already referred to, with the Australian and South African Governments.17. Post Office new Super Station. Simultaneously with the Prime Ministers announcement of the new policy the Post Office began making arrangements for the erection of a new super station equal in power&apos; to any in the world. A site was chosen near Rugby, and the work of erection started without delay.   A brief description of this station appears on page 28.Negotiations with the Marconi Company.18. Following upon Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s declaration of this new policy the Marconi Company applied to the Postmaster-General (Sir William Joynson-Hicks) for a &quot; general licence.&quot; Nego-tiations began in a friendly spirit. On the 8th May the Post-master-General rejected the Company&apos;s application for a &quot; general licence &quot; for the reason &quot; that if granted it would give the company a monopoly of the wireless services of the world so far as Great Britain is concerned and would virtually exclude from those services both the Government itself and any other company who might wish to take part in wireless enterprise.&quot;19. Company&apos;s Interpretation of new Policy. The Company in their reply did not admit that arrangements under a general licence would either exclude Government competition which was intended to be an indispensable part of the Bonar - Law policy nor the issue of licences to other companies. They said that their interpretation of the statement of policy made by Mr. Bo/nar Law did not convey to them the understanding that the Post Office would be taking so important a part in the conduct of wireless commercial services as the)&apos; gathered it was now intended.20. Delays in Negotiations. Negotiations continued between the Postmaster-General and the Marconi Company from March 1923 to January 1924. We have read all the correspondence, which was carried on without undue haste, interrupted at intervals. by conferences; between the representatives of the Post Office and of the Marconi Company, which did not, how-ever, expedite matters. At times negotiations took a turn which suggested that a settlement was at hand, and so the House of Commons was informed more than once. But always some hew point cropped up unexpectedly and negotiations were broken off to be resumed after an interval.
21. Suggested Working Arrangements. Various schemes were discussed, including free competition between the State and Company-owned stations, a regional division of the services, a complete pooling arrangement under unified management with the Post Offioe as predominant partner as regards control, and a partial pooling arrangement. A careful reading of the correspondence leads us to the conclusion that it is exceedingly doubtful whether any agreement on the several lines which were under discussion would ever have worked satisfactorily.22, Ineffective Negotiations. &quot; The suitable arrangements for the working of the traffic,&quot; as mentioned by Mr. Bonar Law in March 1923, were found to be more difficult to-adjust than was contemplated. It was intended, and hoped, that the new policy, sanctioning the participation of private enterprise in Empire wireless, would facilitate progress. Nine months negotiations without a settlement having been reached is a disappointing result. A combination of State and private ownership, even under unified management, could not, it appeared, be settled to the complete satisfaction of both parties. It was impossible to retain the element of competition in commercial wireless which was provided for in the Bonar Law policy, and at the same time have unified management with pooling arrangements.23. A Deadlock. When we began our inquiry we found that the nine months negotiations had ended in a deadlock. In justification of this statement we append copies of letters which passed between the Marconi Company and the Postmaster-General dated 7th, 21st and 26th January. The Postmaster-General, in his letter of the 21st January, referred to important points which had been discussed in previous correspondence but not settled, and the Marconi Company in their reply introduced an issue of vital importance, as it challenges the authority of &quot;the Post Office to refuse the Company a licence or to attach to that licence certain conditions. The statutory powers of the Post-master-General are set out at the beginning of the explanatory statements on page 22 and appear to us to be against the cp -tention of the Marconi Company. This interruption of negotia-tions is a continuation of the misfortunes which have dogged the footsteps of Empire Wireless and caused the lamentable delays which have placed the Empire behind other nations-in the use of wireless telegraphy as an indispensable means of communication throughout the world. -     ., ,        &apos;]&quot;.,&quot;   . .-.-; j24. The negotiations between the Government and the Marconi Company involve controversies which are outside our ^province. The settlement of the claims for war services which the Company makes against&apos;the Government, for instance, does not concern us.25. The Question of Patents.-With regard to patents which figure a good deal-in the correspondence we.would only observe that if the Post Office does not possess the right to use all patented
inventions available in this country, which are considered necessary for the efficient operation of the wireless service, then steps should be taken by arranging for the payment of royalties for the use of such indispensable patents, or by taking action under section 8 of the Patents and Designs Act of 1919 which gives the State power to use a patented invention, provided a fair price is afterwards fixed by agreement or compulsory arbitration.26. Lamentable Consequences of Delay. In view of the legal issue raised by the Marconi Company in their communication of the 26th January, we saw no prospect of satisfactory settlement by reverting to any of the bases upon which negotiations had pro-ceeded ineffectively for nine months. We felt it our duty to keep in view the supreme urgency of recommending a policy which could be carried into effect without delay. Further delays which have occurred will cause intense dissatisfaction in the Dominions. A scheme which can be decided upon without further postponement. and which will work effectivefy, giving cheap, efficient and adequate service, should commend itself to public opinion.The Case foe Public Owmeesi-iip.27. The public ownership of all wireless stations in Great Britain on the principles of the telegraphs would be an idea] scheme which we have not, however, considered. Practice has been in another direction. The pioneer work has. been done by private enterprise and the Marconi Company participates in long distance and.in Continental wireless services under conditions which safeguard public interests.28. Existing Wireless Facilities.--In. considering the position in regard to the British end of Empire wireless we reviewed the existing facilities for wireless communications with the Empire. There is only one station belonging to the Empire system in England, that at Leafield, Oxfordshire, and it is not exclusively occupied in carrying on an Empire service. It is not powerful enough to send messages with regularity and certainty to India or Australia, or South Africa. It communicates with Cairo daily, but that is the extent of its capacity for regular service eastward. On the other hand, it carries on a successful service with Canada. A new medium-power station at Northolt, Harrow, also transmits a certain number of press messages during the night hours to Halifax, Nova Scotia.-29. Leafield Station.-The. high-power station at Leafield (with receiving station at Banbury) is the British end of the un-finished Empire chain.; It was designed in 1913. Its erection was interrupted in December,&apos; 1914, when the contract with the Marconi Company, was cancelled. Construction was not resumed .until:1919. The-masts which had been erected in 1914, were . then, utilized,-but,the station was finished according to revised
0 ^ f*plans. Leafield began business in May 19.22. It communi- fj ** y cates witli the corresponding station at Abii Zabal, near Cairo  the second link in the Empire chain-and transmits a daily average of about 2,350 words. Messages which are intended for Iraq, Palestine, and Syria, where there are receiving stations, are relayed from Cairo. Some of the messages are retrans-mitted by cable from Cairo. Leafield is also used for broad-casting British official messages. News messages are sent to India but cannot be relied upon owing to frequent atmosphere-pheric interruptions. Leafield is also used for sending long distance communications to ships at sea. It also transmits some 35,000 words of news weekly to Halifax; Nova Scotia, for a group of American and Canadian newspapers. Its total outward traffic is between 70,000 and 80,000 words a week.30. Financial Results of Leafield.-The capital expenditure on the Leafield station up to the end of 1923 was  132,362, the amount set aside for depreciation was  19,655 leaving a net outstanding capital liability of  112,707. For the financial . year ending March 1923, including eleven months working of the station, the revenue amounted to.  37,623, and the expenditure to  43,745, showing a deficit of  6,122. Interest and depreciation (inciuded in this expenditure) for the period amounted to  13,910.We have been supplied with the results for nine months ending December 1923. For that period the revenue was  30,296, almost the same monthly average as for the previous period, and the expenditure amounted to  33,211, the result being a loss of  2,915. It is probable that by the end of this financial year this adverse balance will have disappeared. At any rate working expenses will be much more than met. Interest and redemption charges for the year will amount to  14,000. Of the revenue of  30,296 payment from, the Foreign Office for news bulletins and other Government. Departments amounted to about  8,000, but these toUs would have been payable if Leafield had been operated by a com-pany. As this is only the second year of a station which was not constructed on the most modern lines we consider.that the results are satisfactory.31. A single station is handicapped by the heavy establish-ment charges it has to bear and in the case of Leafield the volume of incoming messages is smaif owing to the absence of corresponding high-power stations overseas.32. Cairo Station. We are not favourably impressed with the prospects of the Cairo station. For the financial year 1922-23, during which it had been in operation eleven months, the exjieh-diture was  44,315, and the revenue only  6,521, leaving a loss of  37,794 on an outstanding capital&apos;expenditure of  143,871 The last nine months ending December showed some impfove-nient.  The revenue was  7,071, the expenditure- 33,526, and
the loss  26,455. It is true that Cairo is a terminal station at present. It is further handicapped because it is not duplex, and therefore cannot transmit and receive messages simultaneously.33. Future of Cairo Station-The Cairo station serves for strategic as well as commercial purposes. It is used by the Admiralty as a link between Malta and Aden. Under other conditions no doubt the Cairo station can be made profitable, but we recommend that as soon as the requirements of the Navy are met and a high-power station built in India this station be removed from the Empire Chain.34. Northolt Station.- The new medium power station at Northolt, which is partly used for Empire work, showed a deficit of only  200 for the year 1922-23. The capital expenditure was  42,296; the revenue  6,797, and the expenditure  6,997. The results for the nine months ending December 1923 are disappoint-ing, as the revenue fell to  4,360, and the loss increased to  3,470, owing chiefly to the fact that an Italian station with which it had been communicating went out of commission. Other traffic, however, has now been secured, and we are informed that since the beginning of this year this station has been paying its way.35. We may point out, in comparing the commercial results of a State-owned and a privately-owned enterprise, that the accounts of private wireless companies do not enable us to separate the results of their communication services from their manufac-turing and other activities much less to estimate the results of individual stations.New Empire Stations required.36. In the light of the experience gained during the last two years by the Post Office in managing long distance traffic, we reviewed the position in order to estimate the requirements of the immediate future. The assumption which ran through the correspondence between the Postmaster-General and the Marconi Company is that Leafield station, as it stands, the new Post Office station now in course of erection at Rugby, and two new stations erected by the Marconi Company would be adequate in the near future for handling the British end of Empire wireless.37. Enlarged Rugby Station. The engineers and traffic experts have reported to us again on the position and favour some modifications in. the constructional programme. The Rugby station&apos;as-planned lias 12 masts 820 feet high, with an aerial 1J- miles long and about I mile wide. The engineers now report that-this&apos; station should be provided with 16 masts which with other: contingent improvements will involve an additional estimated cost of  62,000. -
38. Modernised and enlarged Leafield.-The engineers recom-mend that the Leafield station should be modernised at a cost of  60,000. The masts, at present 300 feet high, would be made 600 feet high, and all the other necessary improvements for increased capacity would follow.39. Another World-Power Station. The engineers also state that a second Rugby is necessary to cope with Dominion traffic in the immediate future, and that provision should be made for another station to deal with radio-telephony which would be used for Empire purposes to some extent. We think, however, that this should be postponed pending the results of the trans-Atlantic experiments in radio-telephony which are now being carried on.40. Capital Expenditure required.   As policy with which we are primarily concerned may be affected by expenditure, we may state that the provisional estimates, for the extension of Rugby and Leafield stations and the construction of the two additional stations mentioned amount to a total of  875,000, of which  250,000 is the estimated cost of the radio-telephony station. We would point out that this expenditure would provide, work for many skilled workers and labourers in the steel and engineering trades.Communication with Colonies and Peotectoeates.   ,&apos; -&quot;-41, The schemes considered&apos; and planned for Empire wireless services have been limited to grand trunk routes. Linking up connections with the Colonies or inter-colonial lines have not been taken into consideration. .42. French Colonial Wireless. The French Government has a State wireless service which embraces all the French Colonies. Some particulars are given, on page 42 of our supplementary statements, of this great colonial wireless network which has been set up at an enormous cost showing how seriously France regards, her colonial obligations. This colonial service reaches such far distant places as Indo-China, the West. Indies and French Guiana, Reunion and Madagascar. It is particularly complete in Northern and Equatorial Africa. We also give, some information,, on page 43, relating to the French commercial wireless companies!43. Needs of our Colonial Territories. lathe case of the British s Empire the self-governing Dominions .are looking after their , own wireless, external and internal. But the widely-scattered colonies and protectorates of the Empire-^in -.the, four quarters j of the globe including vast regions with settlements cut.off from-: the means of rapid communication and isolated island territories: -should be served by minor links in an Empire. Chain,
44. Complete Empire Net-work. We suggest that in order to complete1 the Empire scheme the expert Wireless Telegraphy Commission be requested to prepare a;report:on the extent to which receiving stations should be set up in the colonies, what expenditure would be required, and also to give estimates for feeder stations so as to build up a complete Empire net work.45. The Case of the West, Indies. In the case of the Lesser Antilles and British Guiana a group of territories between which the means of rapid communication was inadequate the Government have already taken action. Wireless will be Used to supplement cables, linking up the smaller islands by means of a central station at Barbados. These islands as well as Jamaica, Trinidad and British Guiana will receive news, official communi-cations and other messages direct from the Government high-,power stations in England.Policy in Empire Wireless.46. Having reviewed the progress and results of facilities for Empire wireless and come to conclusions regarding future requirements, we are in a.position to advise on the policy which, in;our opinion, should beiadopted in order to put plans in opera-tipn without further loss of time. As we have indicated, we see no prospect of success on the lines of the policy which have been explored and discussed at much length and in great detail during the last nine months.47. State&apos; Ownership. We therefore feel justified, alike on the merits of the ease and for reasons of expediency, to favour the only alternative and recommend that the Post Office  under conditions which we shall&apos;-propose should erect, own and operate the Empire Wireless stations in England, with an alternative proposal in the case of Canada.48. Special Case of Canada. Canada, while forming part of the Empire scheme, has always received separate treatment.(a) The chain of stations planned in 1913 did not include Canada, probably because the Marconi Company were already providing a service with that Dominion and because at that time wireless science was not equal to bridging the Pacific, a distance of about 6,500 miles, between Australia and British Columbia.&apos;hli : (6) The Imperial r Wireless Telegraphy Committee in their Empire scheme issued in 1920 made no provision for Canada beyond anticipating its participation.w , (c) The Postmaster-General in his statement of Govern-ment policy in January 1921 made no reference to Canada except to say that Canada was itself dealing with the problem.

Present Service to Canada. The service to Canada was formerly conducted by the Marconi Company from a station in the West of Ireland and is now conducted from their station at Ongar, in Essex, to then,&apos; station at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. This service has been working now for 15- years. The Post Office Station at Leafield, not having scope for eastward traffic, started a competitive trans-Atlantic service, to Halifax, Nova Scotia.   &apos;- &quot;^J&apos;1&apos;&apos;- - -    -   -!--&apos;-v50. Position in Canada.&apos; Several factors, peculiar to Canada should be taken into account -(a) the Dominion Government have up to now expressed no intention themselves of erecting or operating wireless stations.(b) The Dominion Government do not own the tele-graphs, which belong almost exclusively to the railway companies and the Western Union, except, that the Govern-, ment have, by acquiring the Grand Trunk and other railways, become the owners of a large section of the. telegraph system.(c) The chief telephone systems are the property of companies.(d) There is also a general interchange of trans-Atlantic communications between Canada and the United States. The Leafield service, for instance, is chiefly for American newspapers which prefer it because of its speed and accuracy. The messages are, in some cases, relayed from Halifax and in other cases received direct.51. Competition in Canadian Traffic. The Post Office is pre-pared to accept as &amp;fait accompli the competitive service to Canada which already exists. The special treatment accorded to Canada in the past leads us to recommend a continuation of the present competitive system as art alternative to the exclusive handling by the Post Office of Canadian traffic. If the latter proposal for exclusive State operation is adopted we think that it is right and equitable that some consideration should be given to the Marconi Company, who have carried on service to Canada for 15 years, and have consequently created a goodwill in the business.   The Company have no legal claim.o  21820 B
5&amp; The&apos;Equipment of the New Stations. It inessential that the hew stations&quot; be equipped with the latest &quot;apparatus. In a transmitting or receiving station most of the- electrical and mechanical inventions are public property either because the patents have expired or because the inventions were never patented. But it is essential that the designers and the engineers iii control should be free to introduce into Govern-ment stations any newly invented devices that may from time to time be deemed necessary to ensure efficiency.53. In this connexion we may point out that the designers of the new Government station at Rugby have not found it necessary to plan for the installation of more than a very small number of live patented inventions apart from those made by Government-servants. We are informed that the patents not already owned by the Government are, so far as the British rights are concerned, owned by the Marconi Company and two other companies.54. We would call attention to the valuable provisions con-tained in Section 8 of the Patent and Designs Act of 1919 which preserves for the Crown the right to use patented inventions and so,&quot;while providing adequate compensation to the holders of the patent, ensures that the State shall not be deprived of its legiti-mate right of user; and we recommend that this section be freely applied wherever the necessity arises. .-55. Financial. Prospects.-^An examination of the results at Leafield, which has certain drawbacks to which we have called attention, encourages us to anticipate that within two or three years of their completion the two high-power Empire stations will - be more than self-supporting., . 5.6. While the important test for the success of State operation ofEmpirewireless should be the commercial one, Imperial, National and strategic considerations must not be overlooked. Posses-sion of machinery in the hands of the State, which can broadcast over the.world, is an asset which cannot be measured by figures. Under private enterprise the wayside places of the Empire the unprofitable stations would not be catered for, except on the payment of subsidies.. .57. Empire Defence. Interests. There is close relationship between a - wireless system owned and operated by the Post Office and the wireless.;services belonging, to the Navy, Army and Air Force. Wireless is an indispensable service in Empire defence. -The Admiralty has stations, in many parts of the Empire,, and the wireless facilities required by the Air Ministry must keep pace with the.expansion of the Air Force. It is needless to explain the advantages,of an alliance, or an arrangement, between. State Departments operating the similar services..58. The Admiralty .plays a large part in research, experi-mental and development, and we can foresee that, as the Post
Office responsibilities grow, the association&apos;.between&apos;&apos;&quot;*hese&apos; two branches of the. Government -will become ;more&apos;&apos;dntiinatej!sand that, generally, strategic -and commercial wireless will become more interdependent. &apos; iti ,..     , ., j,,,^59. National Emergency. We think thai it is fesseniaal that, in aU hcences to be. granted to any private company to operate wireless, the State should reserve to itself the right to take possession or exercise control over, the working licensed stations whenever in the opinion of the Government an emergency requires it; ;,.; ; &apos;-60. Industrial Interests.- In view of the industrial interests concerned in the equipment of wireless stations, we think&apos;that every encouragement should be given to the manufacture in this country of the apparatus required for the transmission . and reception of wireless messages which is in the nature of a.&apos; key industry.Impeoved Business Organisation^ &apos;61. In maldng our recommendation we realise that we con-template a considerable extension of State activities, but we thmk they can be faced with confidence. That they ensure protection of public interests goes without saying. We feel that the Post Office is capable of operating all the stations without a partnership or an association which, in our judgment, with the information before us, would not work harmoniously.62. Wireless and Allied Services. The operation &apos; of Empire wireless by the Post Office, together with:wireless telephony; in which it retains a monopoly, and the control, and probably, also, the operation of broadcasting, national or; mferhational, amount, in themselves, to a large scale &apos; national&apos; business organisation. To these must be added: the&apos;ship&apos;and&apos;/shore wireless services acquired by the State in 1909, which yield the Post Office a net profit of between  11,000 and  15,000 a year, and also the participation of the Post Office in the kindred business of Cables, f &apos;   .;&apos; \:i)  &apos;&apos;;!63. A great part of this business is still in a transition stage. It will demand constant vigilance and ready; action. We would therefore suggest that certain changes are necessary in internal administration so as to cope better with these.developments. &apos;* Note. Mr. 3?. J. Brown did not take part in the discussions underthis head. -7 : -   ;;;.-&apos;,!;;,-.-; ivHK^i, &apos;lii   V-SufliWt The British Government owns two cables across the Atlantic; it is a shareholder in the Pacific Cable and owns jointly with the&apos;Governments&apos;&apos;of the countries named the-following cables (telegraph and telephone) tothe Continent:  . .        - ;..   ; v\;w 7j       , Vr--France -      -      -   16 cables Holland       -      -    4 cablesGermany      -      -    6    ,, Norway     &apos;---*    -&apos; &apos; 2 - ,,Belgium   -   -      -5    ,, &apos; Russia - impracticable.
IfScientific,,^ onj,a: large, scale,aijdjit/lie responsibilities;,!^ will increaseproportionately. The Department will be keenly ^criticised and will. b.e judged largely by its business record. ,To ensure success nothing should be left&apos;undone iri the way of improved organisation so as to ^ut;therbiisMess :6n Quality&apos;&apos; with a private &quot;corporation. Thii Mearis^that&apos; delegation &quot;is &quot;necessary.1 The administrative heact&apos;&quot;6f the &quot;wireless-arid associated services should be able to aSi^pfoiriptlyan aU&quot;!matters*of business, and the norinal routine should be modified, to enable this to be done.65. In conducting wireless service, on the scale here contem-plated the work falls into two divisions : firstly, the handling of the telegraphic traffic, and secondly, the running of the machinery.As regards the telegraphic traffic every item will be managed in the Central Telegraph Office in London, and the telegraph operators there manipulating their transmitting instruments will control by land lines the waves emitted from, for example, the Rugby station. At Rugby the machinery will be started and kept running by the engineering staff as demanded by the traffic. Sirhilarlythe telegram-bearing waves coming from great distances will be received at Banbury, amplified and transmitted in the original morse.over land lines to.the operators at the Central Telegraph Office in London.66. Engineering Interest. When we consider the magnitude and the complication of the machinery installed in a large trans-mitting station and the delicacy of the apparatus at the receiving station it is obvious:that the engineering staff must be highly skilled and that the expert section of the engineering department at the Post Office which is building the stations must be made responsible under the administrative head for running the trans-mitting and receiving stations and for their maintenance in a state of/efficiency. It is necessary also that this section should keep the stations abreast of developments in wireless invention and1 of &quot;the1 general&apos; progress of the science, and that direct contact should be maintained at all times between the wireless traffic management at the Central Telegraph Office and the -wireless section, qf. the -engineering department.,,,&apos;$!?,&apos;, The, administrative . head, should have the. advantage of the.advice of experts of a Wireless Traffic Section,&apos; who will keep themselves abreast of the newest and best methods of working in. the seryic.es of,,other Telegraph Administrations. and of the priy&apos;^te.;Wireies,s\CQmp^hies&quot;both,at home and abroad, and will collect; statistics ,and.&apos; other, information-&apos; as to wireless develop-ments tlmiuglioiit the world, it will be comparable to the Telephone. Traffic Section which already exists at &quot;the&quot; general post oiice: &quot;; &apos; &quot;&quot;:,: &apos; &apos; &apos;:   : &quot;&apos; &apos;&apos;/&apos; ;.
68. Comparison with Private Enterprises. The business organi-sation should be remodelled without disturbing the present system of financial control/ To complete analogy with a business corpora-tion, and safeguard the success of the enterprise, the services of the most capable administrative engineering and executive officers in all branches should be. obtained under conditions which will attract them and retain their services. State wireless administfa-tion will have to meet comparisons with powerful concerns of world-wide ramifications, conducting parallel services, and should aim at maintaining at least an equal standard of. efficiency; as regards equipment, organisation and personnel..    v ...    ,:&apos;    -The Post Office Advisory Council of business men should be consulted on the question of organization.. Ftttitbe Developments.69. We are impressed with the rapid progress which the application of wireless service is making, both in regard to long distance telegraphic transmission and to radio-telephony. -New inventions, now in an experimental stage, may at any time augment the efficiency of both transmitting and receiving stations by improved high-speed automatic methods. Any advance in the rate of word transmission would mean an entire&apos; revision of estimates for future capital expenditure as fewer stations would be required and a reduction in the rates charged for messages.70. Estimates have been placed before us relating to-the amount of traffic -based on the business done by cables -which may be expected to fall to the new Empire wireless stations. These estimates can only be approximate as traffic always tends to grow with the increase of facilities. Given a new service, cheap, speedy, and efficient, Empire traffic will expand in all: directions. The interchange of news and opinions between Great Britain and all the overseas Dominions and Colonies, will, in itself, amount to many more millions of words per annum. We are informed that apart from the help to trade by speeding, up and augmenting inter-Empire communications by.wireless,, finance and credit will also benefit. &apos;    :,.71. The change from long to short credit will become general when direct and continuous wireless communications are estab-lished within the Empire. This improvement will not only render more effective and cheapen the cost of financing Empire trade, but will enable credits to go very much further, by snortfening the period for which, on the average, they will be requned; With more direct and cheaper, facilities for communication, remittances will cost less, trade will be stimulated and the turnover of bank credits will be greater.. As an illustration the use of the cable reduced the period for which credit facilities were required in overseas trade..r 21829
Policy in kbgaed to Foreign Wireless.72. We have been asked to make a supplementary report on the relationship which should exist between Empire and foreign wireless communications and on future policy in regard to foreign wireless. i73. Interchange of Empire and Foreign Stations. With regard to the former, arrangements should be made for an interchange of facilities. If for some reason the working of the Empire stations is interrupted, or is unequal to the traffic load for a given period in the day, then stations should be borrowed from the Foreign Service. If on the other hand foreign stations should be handicapped in a similar way Empire stations should be available on the -same conditions. Payment for the stations borrowed should be at a fixed rate per hour.74. Foreign Wireless Services. The services between this country and foreign countries may be divided into two categories, (1) Anglo-Continental services and (2) Extra-European services. The Norman Committee reporting in 1920 recommended that the long distance foreign services (by which, we understand, they meant the Extra-European services) should be left to private enterprise, it having been the settled policy of the Government up to that time that the Anglo-Continental services should be in the hands of the State. The then Government decided, however, that both the Anglo-Continental and the Extra-European services should be thrown open to private enterprise. The Postmaster-General in January 1921 emphasised this change when he announced that &quot; Private companies are going to be allowed to develop a &quot; service to foreign countries, more especially to the continent &quot;of Europe.&quot;75. Continental Traffic. The Post Office was already in possession of certain stations which were carrying on wireless communication with the Continent, and was on the point of completing other stations for that purpose. The Postmaster-General in the same speech, in which he stated that Private Companies should &quot;develop&quot; Europe, announced that new services to the Continent were being developed by the Post Office.As a result of the Governments decision, provisional permits were given to the Marconi Company to start services with countries which were not already being served by the Post Office stations, subject-to suitable terms being subsequently agreed to. The Company have now four such services, namely, to France, Spain, Switzerland, and. Austria. Among the terms in contem-contemplation, and indeed provisionally agreed between the parties, were provisions for expropriation and for sharing profits.
.76.&apos; Post: Office Continental Services. In the meantime the&apos; Post Office is carrying on services with Holland, Germany;&apos;&apos;&apos; Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, and to a less extent with other countries, by means of its stations at Northolt, Caister and -Stonehaven. The Stonehaven station is. inconveniently situated-.-and is costly to run in proportion to the value of the traffic which it can carry.       -77. History of Stonehaven Station. This station was finished in 1914, but was. not used for commercial purposes till after the , war. It was originally authorised, when Sir Herbert Samuel was Postmaster-General, in 1911, primarily With the. object of providing a means of communication between Aberdeen and the South when the.landlin.es were interrupted, in lieu of the laying of a system of underground wires which was being pressed for by the commercial community of Aberdeen. It was intended also for communication with Russia,. and to a lesser extent with the Scandinavian countries.&quot; As a matter of fact, it has never since its erection been required for the former purpose, as the interruption of landline communica-tion with Aberdeen has never since been complete, and as the underground system is now being extended towards the north it is still loss likely to be required for this purpose in future. The service with Russia, owing to the conditions in that country, has never actually been established. The Stonehaven station has been largely used for experimental purposes, and it has been of considerable value in giving experience to the Post Office engineers in the working of are and valve communication and of &quot; remote control &quot; i.e., a system by which the pressure of. a key in the Central Telegraph Office in London actually sends out signals from the Stonehaven station. ;, -.78. Results of Operation at Stonehaven.&apos; We see no prospect that this station can be made commercially remunerative under existing conditions. It is cited as an example of Post Office failure in wireless. It would have been run at a loss had it been under other management, simply because the traffic . does not exist, and apparently after five years&apos; operation,. cannot be got to make it profitable. The loss on the station for: the year ending March 1923 was.10,070L, the loss for - the nine months ending December 1923 was 6,586L *The: revenue for-the 2,1 months amounted to I1,245L and the expenditure to 27,90U. We are of opinion that the Stonehaven . station should be discontinued;   - &apos; &apos;   &apos;   &apos;:&apos;-   /&apos;  &apos;.&apos; &apos;&quot; &apos;       &quot;&apos;79.. Caister Station. Another small station is situated at Caister intended especially for .communicating&quot;with Holland. It has occasionally served as a relief when cable communication -has been interrupted. For the year 1922-23 this station was&apos; worked at a loss of 2,667Z. The total income was only 1,8&apos;63Z., ahd:&apos;the expenditure. .4,530L  The-revenue was 2,495L for the last rihiec 2
months-.and&apos;&quot;the deficit was 1,253?.-an improvement, but not sufficient to justify its continued existence. &apos;&quot;- &apos;&apos;&apos;-.&apos;&quot;&apos;. -; Wc understand that the Dutch&apos; administration has undertaken to. co-operate in the.,use of high-speed apparatus on &quot;this service, which should bring.about a further improvement.; ;, .    &apos;.-80. Xurlhoit Station.- The traffic now carried on&apos;by Stonehaven arid Caister could be diverted to the newNortholt station, which, with some comparatively inexpensive adaptation, is quite capable of handling it. This station is conveniently situated near London.81. State ownership and private enterprise. No principle which we can discover has been followed in the distribution of Anglo-Continental wireless between the Post Office and private enterprise. One factor which led to the establishment of Post Office wireless with the Continent was the ownership by the Post Office of Anglo-Continental cables, as it was thought desir-able that the two services should be in the same hands, in order that they might be used interchangeably according to the exigencies of traffic. That consideration may apply to conditions existing,between this country and Holland and Germany; but the..;Operation by wireless between England and Erance, Switzer-- land,, Austria .and Spain.has been handed over, by a. previous Government (as distinct from Post Office) decision, under provi-sional licences to the Marconi Company. Policy, it would seem, has:not. been founded on any principle. . ;  --mm-The cables only -join shore to shore, and the wire services witli Central, Eastern and Southern Europe involve the use of long land lines through intermediate countries, working in conjunction with&quot; the cables. : The Post Office and Marconi wireless services, bit the other hand, range over practically the whole of Europe, and present advantages for communication with the more distant Continental.&quot;&apos;Countries which are not so obvious in the case of1 communication with the nearer or limitrophe countries.. 82. iBroadca-sting to the Continent.- The Post Office has retained, jip j;tp; now, the exclusive&apos; right in the use of foreign wireless telephony, including services to continental Europe, and also undertakes telegraphic broadcasting..iBAN6rtholt station-now sends daily 40 broadcast telegraphic ^^Sl%e8^55i^1aSii^-&apos;boMtoerbi&amp;l ihf ormatibri to various agencies ;6ii&apos;:ithe C6ht&apos;meritPi;The -business is: growing,&apos; and -promises to &quot;He a^ery^-remrineratiVe one. - The&apos; Northolt station is&quot; admirably adapted for carrying on this work.    :   : :&apos;r  ;-&apos;&quot;:::: 83.

much better, than.an arrangement for profit-sharing, which would be complicated and likely to give rise to friction. The licence must of course contain a provision reserving to the Govern-ment the right&apos; to&apos; take&quot;-over or&apos;to control the working of the licensed stations in case of national emergency&quot;. It should also provide suitable&apos; safeguards as to the British-character of the Company and matters of that kind. The provisions in respect of. extra-European services should be generally similar (including, in particular, provisions for expropriation and control), .but in this case there should be no royalty on the receipts, inasmuch as the Company would here be in competition with the Cable Companies, who are not required to pay royalties. ...Summary of Recommendations.. 84. Our recommendations are as follows:- ,Empire Services.(1) That the State through the Post Office should own all wireless stations in Great Britain for communication with the overseas Donunions, Colonies, Protectorates and territories.(2) That the Post Office should&quot; operate directly, under an improved business organisation, all the Empire Stations in Great Britain.(3) That as an alternative an exception be made to the foregoing recommendations in the case of Canada, for the reasons stated in paragraphs 48 to 51, and that competition between the Post Office and private enterprise in the Anglo-Canadian wireless service, which exists at present, be continued, provided that, in any licence granted for the Anglo-Canadian service, public interests are safe-guarded as regards conditions of working and terms of expropriation by the State.. ,(4)..That in.any licence grantefl..to\pH^..!^K^, the State must reserve; to itself, the right to takeEpsses-sioh or exercise control over, the working of the licensed , ^stations whenever in the opinion of the. Government an emergency requires it. :,- .(5) That, the Leafield station. should be enlarged as :   i recommended by the Post Offirav.ra^engineers, that the new high-power station, now building at Rugby, should be extended, to,a 16-mast station,. (that a second new station of similar capacity, be: erected r, and that these works should be put in hand without delayer.
(6) That each oi the high-power stations should be of world range and equipped with the latest apparatus, so that the highest degree of efficiency can be attained.(7) That, if necessity arises, full advantage be taken of the Patents and Designs Act, 1919 (Section 8), under which the Crown can acquire the use oi all patented inventions which may be useful for public utility service such as wireless.(8) That in order that State management and operation of Empire wireless may be carried out in a way to ensure the greatest efficiency, an improved business organisation should be set up by the Post Office, and that the Post Office Advisory Council of business men be consulted on this question.(9) That the present terminal wireless station hear Cairo be removed from the Empire system as soon as the requirements of the Admiralty are met. by other stations and the proposed new high-power stations in India, South Africa and Australia, are in operation,(10) That the expert Wireless Telegraphy Commission be requested to report on the extent, and cost, of a wireless system for the Colonies necessary to complete the Empire network of wireless communications.Foreign Services.(11) That private enterprise be given facilities to develop wireless communication with continental Europe, as with the rest of the world outside the British Empire, subject, in the case of Anglo-Continental services, to suitable terms being arranged for. the payment of royalties or otherwise in view of the competition which must exist between wireless and State-owned cables.(12) That there should be free competition in foreign wireless, subject to the State reserving the right of expropriation and the right to take possession and assume control in case of national emergency.(13) For the present the existing provisional licences for Continental services should be renewed, and the Post Office should concentrate its Continental traffic as far as possible at Northolt; the station at Stonehaven should be discon-tinued without avoidable delay; and arrangements should also be made to discontinue the station at Caister as soon as other provision is made for the traffic.(14) That telegraphic and telephonic broadcasting to the Continent be carried on by the Nprtholt station.  ;

EXPLANATORY STATEMENTS.li] BRIEF OUTLINE . OF GOVERNMENT POLICY ON EMPIREWIRELESS SINCE 1904.August 1904. &apos; The opinion of the legislature, when wireless telegraphy was in its infancy,that the powers of&apos; the Postmaster-General should be paramount was shown by Section (lj Subsections 1 and 2 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904, which provide that:- -1. (1) A person shall not establish any wireless telegraph station, or instal or&apos;work any apparatus for wireless telegraphy in any place or on board any British ship except under and in accordance with a licence granted in that behalf by the Postmaster-General.- -. &apos; - (2) Every such licence shall be in such form and for such period &apos; as- the Postmaster-General may determine, and shall contain the terms, conditions, and restrictions on and subject to which tlie ,:        licence is granted, and any such licence may include two or more ;     .. stations, places, or ships.March 1910. The Marconi Company applied to the Colonial Office for licencesfcl\th&apos;e erection of 18 wireless stations hi the British Empire. &apos;.-: The Government decided that an Imperial scheme of this magnitude should be in the hands of the Government themselves and not those of a Company,,   .., .July 1912.   ^ :-.&apos;iAn agreement was concluded with the Marconi Company for the &apos;\ erection of six high-power stations by the Company for the Government. The details of this-agreement were severely criticised in Parliament, and--..a^Select1Committee was appointed to report on it.   The Select .8SS1 duiuU &apos;-&apos; -Committee in turn recommended the appointment of a Committee of Experts!to examine the question from a technical point of view.   This ,,,,,,     ? .,.  Committee recommended certain modifications, and a revised agreement 3&apos;6&apos;VJuly 191&amp; .was concluded on the 30th July, 1913.   This agreement was ratified .by the, HpuseVbf Commons and subsequently by the Dominion Governments concerned.   The agreement provided for the erection by the Company for the Government of six high-power stations, namely, in England, Egypt and East Africa (known as the first three stations) and in Africa, India and Singapore (known as the second three stations). December In December 1914, the Cabinet considered the question of the Imperial1914. stations as affected by the war, and, as a result, instructed the Postmaster-General (Mr. Hobhouse) to terminate the contract with the Marconi Company, as the Government had decided not to proceed with the Imperial Wireless Chain. At that date the erection of the masts at the English and Egyptian stations had practically been completed, and the mast material for the Indian station delivered.November The Cabinet authorised the completion of the stations in England1919. and Egypt, and in November, 1919, the Government appointed thoImperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee (Sir Henry Norman, Chairman) to prepare a complete scheme of Imperial wireless communications. June 1920. The Committee reported in June 1920, recommending a scheme of Imperial wireless communication via Egypt with India, the Far East and Australia on the one hand and with East and South Africa on the other, thus rejecting the Marconi Company&apos;s proposal for direct communication between England on the one hand, and India, Australia and South Africa on the other, in favour of a system of stations (paced at about 2,000 miles apart.
In pursuance of the Norman Committees recommendations, a Corn-mission of Experts, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Eccles, (known, as the Wireless Telegraphy Commission) was appointed to design the December necessary stations of the Chain, select sites, &quot;etc.,:&quot;and the Committee 1920. reported in December 1921.......   ...       .....The Postmaster-General (Mr. Illingworth) announced to a Deputation January 1921. from the Empire Press. Union on 19th January, 1921, that the service between this &quot;Country and the Dominions and4.Colonies would:, be a Government service (as recommended by the Norman Committee).The scheme of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee did. not, July. 1922........however, find favour in the Dominions.    There was a strong Reeling in 5&apos;-&apos;*&apos;&quot;&apos;-&apos;.Australia, South Africa and India, hi favour of direct cbramimicatibn without intermediate points, and, as a result, the situation was recpn-sidered by the Cabinet in July 1922, when the following decisions were arrived at: -(a) The decision of the Australian and South African Governments . to contract with the Marconi Company for the erection of their stations to be acquiesced in. ...(6) The station in England to communicate with the Dominions to be erected by the Government in accordance with,the original scheme, but the size of the station to be approximately doubled.(c) The station in India to be erected by the Imperial Government and to be transferred to the Indian Government when completed. The Indian Government to repay the cost at some later date.(d) Tho stations in East Africa and the second station in Egypt to be definitely deferred and the stations at Singapore and Hong Kong to be reconsidered. . .   , ,,,Such was the position when the Coalition Government went out of office, but the situation was reconsidered in 1923 by:the new:Conservative      i I;;; v,inT, Government, which decided to throw open Imperial communications to February private enterprise, but at the same time to erect, a Government -station I923-partly for strategic purposes and partly to prevent an absolute monopoly by the Marconi Company.   The decision of the Government was announced 5 March 1923. by Mr. Bonar Law in the House of Commons on the 5th March, 1923iiThe progress made in the negotiations with the Marconi Company1 for 24 July 1923; giving effect to the Governments revised policy was announced by the   &apos; !r-&apos;- itofeWS Postmaster General (Sir L.

, , &apos; til] THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENTS ON IMPERIAL WIRE-LESS POLICY WERE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE THEN PRIME MINISTER OR POSTMASTER-GENERAL IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OR ELSEWHERE:-24 July 1913. -    The. Postmaster-General (Mr. Herbert Samuel) in the House cf Commons: 1   \       &quot; The Government are of opinion that the stations of tho.....   Imperial Chain now proposed to be established should bo State-.....owned, and not in the hands of private companies, and this con-, . elusion is in harmony with the recommendations of the Imperil.]: &quot;; Conferenceof 1911, and of the Select Committee of this House on.    the Marconi Contract, as stated in their Special Report of January .   .1913.   The erection of such stations would not necessarily preclude &quot; &quot; t     the grant of licences to private companies to carry on a competing business along the same routes, and there is certainly nothing in &quot;the proposed compact with, the Marconi Company which imposes -----    any restriction on the grant of such licences or has indeed anybearing of any kind on this question. .Thematteris one of policy, which will be open, for review- at any time.,  But the very fact ... that the stations of the Imperial Chain will be owned by tho Governments concerned and will he. conducted by State servants in the public: interest and for the public profit would necessarily, have an important bearing on the coxirse taken in this regard. The risk of mutual interference if several stations using high power are erected in proximity to&quot; each other has also to be borne in ..-.U .   mind.   The Government have not received- any applications for -.f,.-;    licences; for long-range stations- along the route of the Imperial Chain except from the Marconi Company in 1910, and that applica-tion was refused.   It is, of course, very doubtful whether any n;-,; ?&apos;   --;private- company would wish, at all&apos; events in the near future, to invest capital in order to. establish a service in competition, with ., the Imperial Stations.   The question whether the grant of a licence in, any specified territory, if it were made, would or would ; ,-,,&apos;-(   not involve-competition with those stations is one that can only. be. decided with regard to the circumstances of the particular ,-.   . . ...      ......    case, I have already stated that suitable applications for licences&apos; : ;,   to. conduct a trans-Atlantic traffic would not be refused. &apos;;.    , ..1,.*,,..,..&apos;. . :*-.:,*.-;,.,.        *   ,      .,.*-..... There will be no monopoly.

The report of the Plannmg Commission was &quot;sent to&apos;the Dominions-and they were invited to consider-co-operating in the --&apos;&apos;&apos; scheme in accordance with the resolutions of the Imperial Con-ference. So far as I am aware, the Dominions have not yet replied. Preparations are proceeding for the construction of the stations for which the Imperial Government is responsible.&quot;       -.   --&apos;The Postmaster-General (Mr. Kellaway) in the House of Commons :  &quot; The Government have further considered the question of the Imperial Wireless Chain, and have decided to erect in England a station of the ultimate power contemplated by the Expert Commission, instead of the smaller power which they proposed should be used in the first instance. The Government are advised that this station will provide especially direct commercial com-munication with India, South Africa and Australia. In India, the Imperial Government will erect and the Indian Government will work a station also capable of direct communication with England, South Africa and Australia. As a corollary of this decision, the proposed second station in Egypt, and the station in East Africa will be deferred; and the question of erecting stations at Singapore and Hong Kong will be reconsidered.&quot; Communication is proceeding with the Union Government as to the station in South Africa, and the experts Of the Canadian Government are expected to reach England very shortly in order to discuss the participation of Canada in the scheme.&quot; :   &apos;The Prime Minister (Mr. Bonar Law) in the House of Commons:  &quot; The policy to be adopted with regard to Imperial Wireless communications has recently been under review by the Imperial Communication Committee under the chairmanship of the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the recommendations of that Com-mittee have now been approved by the Government.&quot; In view of developments in the science of wireless, telegraphy and other circumstances which have arisen since the late Govern-ment decided upon the policy of a State-operated wireless chain, it is not considered necessary any longer to exclude private enter-prise from participation in wireless telegraphy within the Empire.&quot; The Government has therefore decided to issue licences for the erection of wireless stations in this country for cornmunication with the Dominions, Colonies and foreign countries subject to the con-ditions necessary to secure British control and suitable arrange-ments for the working of the traffic.    &apos;&quot;-- &apos;&quot;At the same time, the Government has decided that it is necessary in the interests of national security that there should be a wireless station in this country capable of communicating with the Dominions and owned and operated by the State. &apos;&apos;A&apos; station of this kind will therefore be erected as early as possible, and it will be available for commercial traffic as well as fOr service13th July 1922.fith March 1923.The Postmaster-General (Sir L.

27si o u[iiii FOLLOWING ARE COPIES OF RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT IMPERIAL CONFERENCES AS. REGARDS IMPERIAL WIRELESS SERVICES:- :(1) The Jmperial Conference of. 1911 :- , ,,t.&quot; Thatthe great importance of wireless telegraphy&apos;for social, commercial, and defensive purposes renders- it desirable &apos;&quot;-that a -&quot;    chain of British State-owned-wireless stations should be established within the Empire.&quot;(2) The Conference of Prime Ministers and Representatives of the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India, June to August, 1921 : &quot;It is agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take steps for the erection of the remaining stations for which they are responsible, as soon as the stations are designed; that the Govern-ments of Australia, the Union of South Africa and India should take similar action so far as necessary and that the Governments of Canada and New Zealand should also co-operate.&quot;The above scheme was accepted by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth subject to giving fidl freedom of action to Australia to decide the method hi which Australia will co-operate.(3) The Imperial Economic Conference, October and November, 1923 : &quot;That this Imperial Economic Conference affirms the impor-tance of establishing as quickly as possible an efficient Imperial service of wireless communication, and is of opinion that the several Governments of the Empire should take immediate action to remove any difficulties which aro now delaying the accomplishment of this, while providing adequate safeguards against the subordination of public to private interests.&quot;
Vost Office as Licensing Anthc-rlty.Inspection of Ships&apos; Wire-loss Installations and Examina-tion of Wireless Operators and Watchers.Ship andShoreService.Anglo-ContinentalServices.Oxford andCairo Stations.New Super-Power Station at Rugby.[iv] POST OFFICE WIRELESS ACTIVITIES.By the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904, it was made illegal to iustal or work wireless telegraphy in the United Kingdom or on board British ships in territorial waiters&apos; except with the Postmaster-General^ licence. The Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Act, 1919, made it com-pulsory for all British sea-going ships over 1,600 tons to carry wireless apparatus. The Post Office conducts the inspection of such apparatus under the Act, and also the examinations of Wireless Operators and Watchers for the -Postmaster-GeneraUs Certificate.The ship and shore stations of the Marconi Company and Lloyds, 10 in number, were purchased by the Postmaster-General in 1909. The ship and shore service now comprises 12 stations in all, viz., Cullercoats, Devizes (long distance), Fishguard, Grimsby, Lands End, Malin Head, Niton, North Foreland, Portpatrick, Seaforth, Valentia and Wick. During the year ended the 31st March, 1923, these stations handled a total traffic of 3,000,000 paid words. .    ...The first Post Office point to point station was erected at Stonehaven in 1914. Since the war it has been re-equipped for carrying on services with Germany, Poland, Esthonia and Scandinavia. The Caister station was re-equipped in 1920 for communication with Amsterdam, and a new medium-power station was opened at Northolt in August 1922. It is used for communication with Czecho-Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, Roumania and Yugo-Slavia, for broadcasting news and commercial intelligence to the Continent, and for the transmission of press messages to Halifax (Nova Scotia). These stations are operated &quot;duplex&quot; with &quot;remote control&quot; from the Central Radio Office at the Central Telegraph Office, London, during the greater part of their working hours, reception from the corres-ponding stations on the Continent being effected by means of aerials on the roof of the Central Telegraph Office.High-power stations at Leafieid, near Oxford (with receiving station at Banbury), and Abu Zabal, near Cairo, were completed in August, 1921, and April, 1922, respectively, and. a regular service was opened in May, 1922, for telegrams between Great Britain, on the one hand, and Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, Somaliland, Syria, Abyssinia, and Erythrea on the other. Leafieid is also used for broadcasting British official communiques, for the transmission of press messages to Halifax (Nova Scotia) and India and for long distance communication with ships.A new super-power Imperial station is now in course of erection at Rugby.The aerial, which will be supported on 12 masts, 820 feet high, will be about 1-1 miles long and about I mile wide. A site of about H- square miles has been acquired for the purpose. While the whole of this area may not be required in the first instance, it was considered desirable to ensure room for expansion in case it should be decided to erect additional masts later on. The masts are to be pivoted at tlie foot and insulated on specially designed insulators supported on a base several feet high, composed of specially selected granite blocks.Power will be obtained from a three-phase public supply. The power plant at the station will consist of motor generators arranged to give a high tension direct current output of 1,000 kilowatts at any voltage which may be required between 4,000 and 18,000 volts. The high frequency generator will be made up of banks of valves arranged in such away as to deal with an output to the aerial of from 200 to 500 kilowatts.Anoarth screenwith earthing points will be provided.The station will be capable of communicating with any part of the Globe. Endeavours are being made to complete the station in time to commence a service by the end of- tlje present year, or immediately after. Good progress in connection with the construction of the station has been made; building operations have already commenced; two of the masts are in actual; course of erection on the site, whilst the bulk of the mast material has been &quot;manufactured; the contract for the supply of power is practically concluded and orders for the power plant have been placed.
I v I NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE POST OFFICE AND THE MARCONI COMPANY.(copies of correspondence.)Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph-Company, Ltd.;Marconi House, 1/555. Strand, W.C.2,January 7, 1924.The Secretary, ..General Post Office, &quot;&apos;...&apos;-  - -   .  London, E.C. 3.Sm, . - &quot;We understand that it is the desire of the Postmaster-General that we should submit a draft of the Poohng Agreement for the establishment of Empire wireless telegraph services setting out the terms which we should be willing to accept. We have accordingly prepared a. draft based as nearly as possible upon the previous drafts which.were trader consideration, and hand you herewith two copies thereof. :We have left in blank on page 6, end of Clause 1, the meaning of &quot; Post Office patonts &quot; in order that you may fill in what is to be under-stood under this head when you will have received the necessary information from the other Government Departments.. - :-- .;------&apos;-;In Clause 20, Sub-Clause 2, we are providing for the payment to us by the Postmaster-General of a quarter of a penny for the transmission of each word of each telegram between England and countries beyond Europe, as a royalty for the use of our patonts; and in Sub-Clause 3 for.the transmission of telegrams between England and European countries provision is made for the payment of a royalty of one-eighth of a penny for -each word of each telegram. The Directors regard the principle of -payment for the use of their patents as of the highest importance.&apos;., They, however, desire to inform you that they would be nevertheless willing to make an exception in the case of telegrams to pool countries in the -event -of a satisfactory Pooling Agreement being entered into between the&apos;Post Office.and the Company, if the lieen.se for the Stations be granted to the Company upon acceptable terms. --We have not provided for what should happen.in.several eases where the Advisory Board may be in disagreement. We are, of-opinion, how. ever, that, if only for the better working of the Advisory Board, we, should agree upon an authority who should have power to decide where, they disagree. Inasmuch as the conduct of the Dominions services would be in question, we would suggest that in case of need, the Advisory Board should submit the points in disagreement for ,the decision of,one pr&apos; other of the High Commissioners concerned., If you see. your way, to accept this proposal we would suggest a clause being added to the.agreement which shall make the necessary provision. .,, :-Vv/!We also return to you herewith the draft, license; lor British Empire and Foreign stations as: submitted.by ..you,..with- certain-amendments which we would propose as altered m red ink.. &quot;Clause 1-6 remains in&apos;blank pending your:defining&apos; the Words-&quot; British character of the Oompany.&quot; &apos;   &quot;-- &apos; :: -&apos;- &apos;.&apos;-&apos;- V-&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;:&apos;-* &apos;- &quot;yrtV^U&apos;&apos;&apos;:&apos;-&apos;The modifications which we are proposing, are hot of very n-.(U*rial importance until we arrive at Clause 31. This clause as originally drafted is economically unsound. We have amended -the. clause to read.that the consideration&apos;to be paid try the^ Postmaster-Geiierai-Eor-any. group
soor groups of stations purchased by him under any of tho provisions of the license shall be a sum equal to the &apos;&quot; fair value as a going concern &quot; at the time of the expiration of any notice, &amp;c. We think this would be the most equitable condition under which the Postmaster-General should purchase if he so elects, but we would be quite willing to consider any modification or alteration if that which we are proposing is not acceptable to the Postmaster-General.&quot;   &quot;     &apos; I am, Sir, ....Your obedient Servant, MARCONIVS WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO., Ltd., (Sgd.)     Godfrey C. Isaacs, - Managing Director.General Post Office, London, E.C. 1.,.  . , 21st January, 1924.P.O. ref. 95785/23. Your ref. 1/555.Sir, :With reference to your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing drafts of the proposed Pooling Agreement and Licence in respect of Imperial services, setting out the terms which the Marconi Company would be willing to accept, I am directed by the Postmaster-General to say that he has given careful consideration to the matter.&apos; There are a considerable number of minor points involved in the drafts as altered by the Company, which require further examination, and which, in some, cases at least, will probably require amendment. But, before entering into details, the Postmaster-General thinks it well to express his views on the more important issues.The principal question at issue seems to be the Company&apos;s proposal as to the payment to be made in the event of the Government exercising the option to purchase the stations a payment which is described as &quot;the value of the stations as a going concern.&quot; The Postmaster-General is unable to understand why the British Government should be expected to agree to less favourable terms of purchase than are laid.down in the .Company&apos;s Agreement with the South African Government in respect, of the station which it is proposed to erect in South Africa, if such option is not exercised until the end of the licence, and he feels that it would be very difficult to defend such a discrimination against the Imperial Govern-ment in the House of Commons. If, however, the option is exercised within the first 10 years, it would not be unreasonable that any expendi-ture necessary for establishing the business which was not represented by a tangible asset should be taken into account.As regards the use of patents, the Postmaster-General gathers from the Company&apos;s letter that they do hot insist that the clauses dealing with tliis matter should stand in their present form. He. thinks it essential that there should, be mutual free use of patents in respect of commtmica-tion between.this country and the rest of the Empire at all events during the; continuance of the Pooling Agreement&apos;. Similarly, in the event-of an Agreement being arrived at between the Company and the Government in respect of Anglo-Continental services, there would be mutual free use of patents for communication between this country and European coun-tries. --He would be willing to agree to a payment of one-sixth of a penny a word.in respect of communication between the Post Office stations and foreign countries, outside Europe, if Marconi patents should be.used at the stations for that purpose. He notes that the Company propose that the provisions as to the use of patents should be confined to their use for wireless telegraphy as distinct from wireless telephony.
As regards the Company&apos;?, proposal that in the evoat of disagreement by the Advisory Board, the High Commissioners should;;be empowered to arbitrate as to, the.services in whioh the Domihions they represent are concerned,, the,Postmaster-Greneral would point out that&apos; the Advisory Board must be,advisory only,.but he recognises thatthere may be oases in which the respective parties, &quot;having received the advice&apos; of the Advisory Board may be unable to agree bh matters connected with the carrying on of the services. If the Company&apos;are prepared to&apos;meet&apos;his views on the other point referred to, he will give further consideration to this question. .... vHe has no objection to the Pool continuing for a definite term of years, but he considers 10 years too long. He would, however, be prepared to agree to a minimum term of seven years, provided that the Postmaster-General is free to discontinue the services from his station in this country at any time at his discretion.I am to add that the settlement of the Company&apos;s claim for war services, on the basis already provisionally agreed to must be regarded as the essential condition of the grant of any licence or concession by theGovernment. .-.-;.&apos; &apos;.-..;.. .....I am SirYonr obedient Servant,  .(Sgd.)

I&apos;am directed to send you the following reply.The Direotors note that there are a number of minor points involved in the drafts as altered by the Company which require further examination and which, in some cases at least, would probably require amendment, but before entering further into details the Postmaster-General thought it well to express his views on the more important issues;       J;       &apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;:These are three in number, and the principal one of them, relates to&apos;the company&apos;s proposal as to the payment to be. made in&apos;the event,of tlie Government exercising the option to purchase the stations prior to tie expiration of the term of license. The second relates to patents; and the third to the settlement of the Gompony^s claim for war services.) -.uoWith regard to the first of these, the DirectbrSpOint out that&apos; the coh-ditions of the Union station will differ materially from the conditions :6f the home stations. The Company, taking the different eircivmstaiices&apos;int&apos;0 consideration, felt that it would not :be imsoiind to&apos; accept&quot;eoriditions &apos;ih South Africa which would be economically miacceptable in this^coirhtry, and the Company submits that in view of this it woitlcl&apos;iwfcbe&apos;fair&apos;to:tak&apos;e the South African terms as a precedent. ;&apos; -    &apos;..:i&quot;... irtS v$,t&amp;WfThe Company is.glad to note that the.PostWaster-General-recogni^s that in the event of the Government &apos;exeicisihg&apos;&apos;its;&apos;bptibh&apos;pri6r&apos; to:&apos;tlie expiration of the term of the license it&apos;-would&apos; not be reasohable&apos;^0 irisist&quot;oh the same terms of purchase as would be applicable ;&apos;iri&apos;th&apos;e&apos;:event:-&apos;bl&apos; that option not being exercised. &apos; i -       &apos;-&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;     *b wwwaq eif*111   21820 . -        r .V
Tho Directors therefore propose that Clause 31 of the terms of license as amended by the Company shall be further amended by strikin&quot; out the. words &quot; and thirty &quot; from the fifth line thereof, and that there shall be added to Clause 31 conditions which shall provide that the terms of purchase under Clause 30 shall be, as proposed by the Post Office, exelu-sive of any allowance for past or future profits or any compensation for compulsory sale, &amp;c.As regards the second question, that relating to the use of patents, the Directors venture to think that the Postmaster-General has not appre-ciated the full significance of his proposal and are desirous of submitting the following points for further consideration.On the occasion of the interview with the Postmaster-General on the 18th June last, when the question of the right of use by the Government of the Company&apos;s patents free of royalty was mentioned, the Postmaster-General said that he would press for this right in respect of the Pool countries if the proposal for a Pooling Agreement were conceded. Tho Company in its letter to the Postmaster-General under date of 21st June last said that if a satisfactory and embracive agreement could be arrived at upon the basis of the memoranda then submitted it would be prepared to meet the Post Office generously with regard to the patent question; and the Company&apos;s letter of the the 7th instant submitting its proposed draft agreement and amended terms of license conceded all which it had hitherto understood the Postmaster-General demanded in respect of patents in the event of a satisfactory Pooling Agreement being entered into.The Directors regard this concession as one of considerable importance, and had hoped that it would be fully appreciated as such. The request now made that the Post Office should have the right of use free of royalty of the Company&apos;s patents, not only for the pool countries but for communi-cation with the British Empire, and between this country and the European countries, is one made now they think for the first time during the course of these negotiations.We have on a previous occasion informed you that we expend in research and experimental work in the development of the art of wireless telegraphy a sum of approximately  80,000 per annum, and in respect of patent fees  18,000 per annum., The proportion of this expenditure relating to British patents is estimated to be one-third, and therefore in the neighbourhood of  33,000 per annum. To this should be added interest upon-capital and amortization of that capital which has been expended in the development by the Company of the art of wireless telegraphy. This capital expenditure represents not less than some  2,000,000 sterling. Interest and amortization, there-fore, might be fairly represented by a sum of, say,  105,000 per annum.The Post Office ask, if we have correctly understood, that they shall have, free of any payment, the benefit of everything achieved by this annual charge to the Company, and as a consequence that the Company shall be handicapped as against the Post Office, a cable company or any other competitor, with this heavy expenditure as a first charge.The Post Office request is therefore the equivalent of a demand upon the Company for a considerable annual payment in consideration of the grant of a license to erect stations in this country; a payment the extent, of which cannot at present be foreseen for reasons which I will refer to later.No such request has ever been made upon a cable company for cable-landing rights; no such request has ever been made in respect of a license for,a wireless telegraph station. This Company was granted a license for Clifden on undertaking to pay the ordinary license fee. A license was granted similarly for the erection of a station at Carnarvon with the same consideration. . Licenses have been granted to the Company for the erection of stations at Ongar on similar terms. The Eastern Cable Company 1ms applied for a license, as stated by the Postmaster-General in the House of
Commons, and that request, if persisted in, will be acceded to upon normal terms. If any further serious application be made by anybody to the Post Office for a license to erect a wireless telegraph station to conduct a competitive service with the Company, it will be granted. The Postmaster-General has recently stated that he has offered to this Company a license in consideration of the payment of the usual fee to erect a,station to communicate with South America.In these circumstances we would ask the Postmaster-General to say whether it is fair and reasonable that the Company should be asked to pay so heavily and so exceptionally for the license for which it now applies.The ex-Secretary of the Post Office, Sir Alexander King, in reply to a question put to him when giving evidence before the Select -Committee, on the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, Limited, agreement (reference question 4399, et seq.) stated that there was no monopoly given to the Post Office with regard to wireless telegraphy, and subsequently he stated, in reply to further questions upon the subject of licenses, &quot; you might as well argue that because a motor car needs a &apos; license, therefore the Govern-ment has a monopoly of motor cars&apos; . . . the Postmaster-General was made the licensing authority, as in other cases the Liland Revenue are the licensing authority, and the Local Government Board, I believe, issue licenses, but it does not give them a monopoly. The fact that an authority is authorised to issue licenses does not give that authority a monopoly. There is a great difference between a license and a monopoly.&quot; .... &quot;I cannot believe that Parliament when giving the Postmaster-General the control of wireless work ever intended that he should use that power to obtain concessions from an inventor or from a competitor. I should like . to go further and say that I think the very suggestion of such a course is dishonest.&quot; He further added that the Wireless Telegraphy Act provides &quot;that the Postmaster-General shall license&quot; . . . &quot;he is merely a licensing authority, but it does not give him a monopoly.&quot;In the Company&apos;s view the Post Office has accepted this interpretation as being the true intention of the Legislature as set forth in the Act, and has always acted consistently therewith where licenses for wireless telegraph stations have been granted, both to this Company and to others, as evidenced by the instances which have been stated above. In such circumstances the Company does not feel that it is fair, especially in view of the pioneer work which the Company has conducted in making wireless telegraphic services practicable, that there should be discrimination to its grave prejudice on the part of the Post Office between it and any other applicants for a license, or between it and the Cable Company to whom is granted a cable landing right, the equivalent of a license. Of necessity this Company must be in competition either with the Cable Company or&apos; with any other successful applicant for a wireless license, and it is sub-mitted with confidence that it is not right that there should be placed upon the Company the heavy burden and serious handicap which such discrimination would involve.The Postmaster-General pressed that, so far as Pool countries were concerned, the free user of the Company&apos;s patents should be conceded, and notwithstanding the above considerations the Company, yielded,.but it is felt strongly that it is unreasonable that it should be called upon to make the further serious concessions involved. in the proposal. which is, now made. &apos; &apos;r,&apos;&apos;l&quot;,&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;- :.The third point would appear to the Company to mean that either the Company must accept the sum which the Post Office has offered for its war services or no license of any kind will be granted to it.&apos; -Such a concession would, in the opinion of the Directors, involve a &apos; very great sacrifice in addition to the burden to which we haVe already referred. - &apos;      &apos; ; . -&apos;- &quot;&apos;Again we would, add that no such conditional sacrifice will be asked of the Eastern Cable Company or any other applicant for a license for * wireless telegraph station.0  21829b
The basis of settlement of our claim for war services, to which reference is made, was reluctantly entertained by the Company in 1921. It was, however, then felt that the urgency of the granting of licensed;es to the Company was so great and the securing of the good will of the Post Office towards the Company so imperative, in respect of its many negotiations with foreign Governments which were then pending,, that the Company should be willing to face the sacrifice asked as the price of the then com-plete good accord which was to be established between the Post Office and the Company. Had such an agreement then been entered into it would have been of immense value to the Company and would have avoided during all these years their position of inferiority in regard to other foreign wireless companies in then1 negotiations with foreign Administrations. The Company, therefore, decided to make the sacrifice, and was prepared to sign the proposed agreement, when it was at the eleventh hour confronted with a new demand, that in addition to the above sacrifice, it should give to the Post Office the right of use free of any payment of all the Company&apos;s patents, present and future. This demand the Company were unable to accede to, and the agreement fell through. The consideration which the Company contemplated obtaining for the sacrifice which they were requested to make has been lost to them, with consequences which have reacted upon their business throughout the world.The Directors would make a very earnest appeal to the Postmaster-General to take all these circumstances into full consideration, when they are confident that he will recognise that the substantial concession with regard to patents which the Company has agreed to make is as much as can be justly demanded of them.They further believe that he will regard the question of the war services as one totally independent of the question of license, and that he will be prepared to accept the offer which the Company has made that failing agreement in respect of the amount to be paid to them the matter be left to the decision of an arbitrator. In that hope the Company has refrained from pressing the Petition of Right which they lodged, but which they have held over now for several years.Upon the subject of patents we repeat that we have offered to concede to the Post Office all that the ex-Postmaster-General demanded of us. The request now made is one, the importance of which neither the Post Office nor the Company can fully appreciate. We have stated in the earlier part of the letter that it is a demand the extent of which is unlimited and unknown. The cost of the patents and of the work which may lead up to the application for patents over the many years represented by the proposed agreement will be a very considerable but unknown figure. In addition there will be the cost to the Company of any and every patent which it may feel it incumbent upon it to purchase and in respect of which under the Post Office proposal no consideration of any kind would be paid by the Post Office.The Company is earnestly anxious to agree with the Post Office on mast reasonable terms, but as a commercial company it is practically impossible for it to give away without consideration an asset of great value representing an immense capital outlay in the past, and in the future a substantial continuing annual cost together with further capital expenditure of an unknown amount.We repeat that we appeal to the Postmaster-General to give all these matters his fair and unbiassed consideration and to afford us an early opportunity of supplementing the many matters to which we have referred in this letter.&apos;I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, MARCONPS WIRELESS TELEGRAPH Co., Ltd., - (Sgdi)     Godfrey C.

9^35.-. -&apos;0 &quot;[vi]   summary of position of   wireless   in   the dominions and india.The Union Government have entered into an agreement with the youth Marconi Company for the formation of a South African Company for Africa, the erection of a high-power station in South Africa. The station is primarily intended for communication with this Country, but is also intended to work with the new high-power station to be erected by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in Australia, and with any stations of allied Wireless Companies in India, Canada, the United States, Argentine, Brazil or elsewhere.   A summary of the agreement is annexed.The Commonwealth Government have become the owners of a majority Australia, of the shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and arrange-ments have been made for the erection, through the medium of that Company, of a station in Australia for communication with this Country and Canada. The agreement between the Company and the Government also provides that the Company shall arrange for the erection and opera-tion of suitable corresponding stations in the United Kingdom. A summary of the agreement is annexed.The Company have also under contemplation a scheme, which has been provisionally approved by the Imperial Government, for taking over and improving the existing stations in various islands of the Western Pacific.The Canadian Government have issued a licence to the Marconi Canada. Company of Canada for the establishment of a high-power station at Montreal, in place of the existing station at Glace Bay (Nova Scotia), but according to the latest information, a commencement has not yet been made with its erection. A licence has also been issued for the establishment of a high-power station at Vancouver for communication with Montreal, Australia, Japan and this Country, but, so far as is known, the erection of the station has not yet been commenced. Both licences are in the ordinary standard form and are issued for one year only. No definite provision is made for renewal, but it may no doubt be assumed that, apart from special reasons for termination, the licences would con-tinue to be renewed year by year. The licences are, of course, hOn-exclusive, and.it is understood that the Canadian Government holds itself free to issue similar licences to any other applicants.   .The New Zealand Government have had under consideration the New Zealand erection of a high-power Government station for direct communication with this Country, but the project has been deferred pending a decision as to the policy to Be adopted&apos; in this Country.The. Indian Government have announced that they are prepared to India, enter into an agreement with and to grant a licence to private enterprise in India for the. establishment and operation of a station to provide the Indian link in the Imperial wireless scheme, and also for communication with other parts of the world. Applications will be accepted up to the. 1st August next, and the successful applicants will be required to register, a Company in India, at least 60 per cent, of the capital of which must be, offered for subscription in India. The conditions governing the grant of a licence entail the establishment of a station capable of conducting high-speed duplex wireless. communication in two directions simultaneously, together with simultaneous reception from at least three other directions; at rates of;charge which shall not exceed the cable rates from time to time&quot; prevailing, and require a guarantee of direct communication with the United Kingdom or South Africa on the One hand, and with Australia or Canada on the other.b 2

[ix] THE MARCONI COMPANY AND ITS ASSOCIATED INTERESTS.The Marconi Company of this country, the Cie. Generate de. T.S.E., (France), the Radio Corporation of America, and the Gesellschaf t fiir Drahtlose Telegraphie of Germany, which, according to Senator Marconi are &quot; the only four important Companies in the world developing long distance wireless telegraphy,&quot; have combined to form a wireless trust, known as the Commercial Radio International Committee (A.E.E.G. Syndicate), which seeks to prevent overlapping and to allot spheres of exploitation. The Agreement between the parties provides for the mutual use of patents and for the allocation of wavelengths. Under this arrange-ment the Marconi Company is understood to have secured until 1945 the right to use within the British Empire all patents of the Erench-Ameriean and German Companies. Mr.. E&apos;J. Nally, ex-President of the Radio-Corporation of America, has been appointed Managing Director of Inter-national Relations in connection with the Combine, with headquarters at Paris.The Companies have entered into a &quot; Consortium &quot; Agreement for the purpose of forming &quot; National&quot; Wireless Companies throughout South America, which provides, inter alia, that the stations of the &quot; Consortium &quot; Companies shall not communicate with stations belonging to any party outside the &quot; Consortium.&quot; One of the &quot; National &quot; Companies formed under this Agreement is the Argentine National Company, which has. ab-sorbed the Marconi Company&apos;s interests in the original Marconi Company of the River Plate. This Company has recently completed a new high-power station at Monte Grande, the material for which was supplied mainly by the Gesellschaft fiir Drahtlose Telegraphie. The latter Company is also said to exercise a preponderating influence in the Argentine National Company.A Brazilian National Company has also been formed by the &quot; Coh-sortium,&quot; but has not made much progress.In 1921 the Marconi Company entered into an Agreement with the Peruvian Government under which the Company have taken over for 25 years, not only the wireless, but also the Postal and Telegraphic Service in Peru.In 1910 a Marconi subsidiary company secured a concession for 21 years from the Spanish Government for the provision and operation of wireless services in Spain and its Colonies.A Swiss Marconi Company was set up in 1921 to erect a wireless station in Switzerland, under a 25 years&apos; concession from the Swiss Government.In August, 1921, the Marconi Company secured an interest in a company known as the Swedish Radio Company, which is understood to be mainly employed in equipping ships. . .In 1922 a new Company was established in Austria with a capital of  130,000, 30 per cent, of whose shares are held by the Austrian Government, about 5 per cent, by a number of Viennese Banks and the rest by the Marconi, Company, for the purpose of taking over existing wireless stations and erecting new ones for- both European and extra-European communication..A Marconi subsidiary Company has recently secured a concession from the Portuguese Government.The Marconi Company also has an interest hi a Roumanian Wireless Company, known as the, &quot; Radio Romana,&quot; which has been created to take up. a wireless concession for 15 years. The Marconi Company is associated with the Cie. Generate de T.S.F. in this venture.       ,An agreement for the installation of a wireless service throughout Greece was concluded in November 1923 between the Greek Government and the Marconi Company..In China the Marconi Company has entered mto an agreement for the creation of a Chinese-National Wireless Company, half of whose shares
are held by the Chinese Government and half by the Marconi Company, for the manufacture of wireless apparatus in China; but the Chinese Government seem disposed to ignore their concession to this Company.In 1922 an agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth Government and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), Limited (a Marconi Subsidiary) for&apos;the erection of a high-power wireless station in Australia for communication with this country and with Canada.The Government of the Union of South Africa have entered into an agreement with the Marconi Company for the formation of a South African Company for the erection of a high-power station in South Africa for communication with this country and other parts of the Empire.The following statement gives particulars, so far as information is available, of various Companies (apart from those concerned with the &quot;Combine &quot; and &quot; Consortium &quot; referred to above) engaged in the commer-cial development of wireless telegraphy and telephony, in whicli the Marconi Company have an interest: Name of Company.

fx] WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY IN FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,By the courtesy of the French Telegraph Administration and the Compagnio Generale do T.S.F., we have been favoured with valuable information (some of it confidential) in regard to Wireless.Telegraphy in France.The French Government have retained in their own hands the wireless services with the French Colonies and Protectorates, while the services with foreign countries, apart from Sweden, Poland and Bulgaria, have been entrusted to private enterprise.lhe French Colonial services are carried on by the Administration dps Postes et des Teiegraphes from the Lafayette station near Bordeaux. This station, built by America for -war purposes and sold to France on very moderate terms after the war, is of world-wide range, and com-municates daily official news and private messages to the most distant parts of the French Empire overseas. These services are at present unilateral in the direction from France, with the exception of Saigon, where a high-power station capable of communicating in the reverse direction has just been completed, and is being operated by the Compagnie Generale de T.S.F. on behalf and. at the expense of the Government. Another of equal power is in course of erection by the French Ministry of War at Tananarive iIn addition to . Indo-China and Madagascar the services cover Senegal, French Guinea, &quot;ivory Coast, Dahomey, French Equatorial Africa, Reunion, French Somaliland, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, St. Pierre, and Miquelon.The traffic at present is small.The news broadcast by the Lafayette station is picked up all over the world. It is collected in India, in China, and other foreign countries. It can also be picked up in Australia and in New Zealand. The Lafayette station is equipped with arcs of-a nominal power of 1,000 kilowatts.The Telegraph Administration also controls the Lyons station, which, erected during the war, is capable of sending messages 6,000 miles or more, but not with -the same certainty as the Lafayette station. It is used for broadcasting political and press news in French, and. for official communications with Annapolis (United States). It also communicates with Sweden, Poland and Bulgaria.A station near Nantes, also erected during, the war,, belongs to tho Navy. Department and is used, for official purposes and for long distance communication with ships. .....The Eiffel Tower station in Paris and a station at Saint-Pierre-des-Corps, belong to the French Ministry of War, but are used for other than military purposes the former for broadcasting; the latter for communi-cation with Morocco and for broadcasting news messages for reception in European countries.These French Government stations involve a considerable annual loss. Their primary object is to link up the whole of the French Colonial Empire in Africa, India, the Far East, Oceana and the West Indies. They are largely used for official purposes.In addition to Saigon and Madagascar, the French Government scheme of development contemplates the immediate erection of high-power stations in Southern Algeria and French Equatorial Africa. Additional stations are contemplated at Noumea (New Caledonia), Tahiti, Martinique and Djibouti. :With the exception of the Colonial and official services carried on by the Government, Wireless -Telegraphy in France is in the hands of the Compagnie Generale de Telegraphic Sans Fil, who have secured a concession for 30 years for the erection and exploitation of commercial wireless services-between France and foreign countries. The Company have erected a system of transmitting stations, comprising four instal-
lotions for Continental and two for Trans-Continental communication, at Ste. Assise, near Paris, and a corresponding receiving centre at Ville-cresnes with 10 distinct receiving posts, both transmission and reception boing controlled from a Central Bureau in Paris by the method known as &quot; remote control.&quot; The capital cost of the Transcontinental transmitting system was about 31 million francs, exclusive of the cost of the receiving and operating centres, which are common to both Continental and Trans-Continental services, amounting to about 121 million francs. Services are now in operation between Paris and the following European capitals:- -London, Madrid, Prague, Bucharest, Belgrade, and Chiistiania. The Trans-Continental station communicates mainly with the United States, but it is also used to a limited extent for transmission to beyrout (Syria), and a new service has just come into operation with the recently completed high power station at Monte Grande in the Argentine. The total traffic transmitted to the United States is about 3   to 4 million words a year. As might be expected from the conditions prevailing in the United States, the received traffic is less than the outward traffic.The Gompagnie Generate de Telegraphie Sans Fil is the parent company of a number of subsidiaries in France, and has an international organisa-tion. The parent company has a capital of 50,000,000 francs. Its chief subsidiary is the Compagnie Radio-France, with a capital of .60,000,000 francs, which is the operating company. &apos; -      &apos;The Societe Francaise Radio-Electrique,with a capital of 12,000,000 francs, is a manufacturing concern.The Compagnie Radio-Maritime, capital 5.000,000 francs, operates Naval stations and serves aeroplanes.Societe La &quot; Radiotechnique,&quot; capital 1,000,000 francs, is engaged in the manufacture of valves.A new subsidiary known as the Compagnie Francaise Radiophonie has recently been formed for broadcasting.The Compagnie Generate has a series of associated wireless companies in foreign countries, including the Beige Kadioelectrique in Belgium, and companies in. Italy, Poland, Roumania, Czecho-Slovakia, Syria, and Switzerland, Their principal international affiliations are with the Marconi Wireless Company, the Radio Corporation of America, and the GeseHschaft fiir Drahtlose Telegraphie of, Germany. The Compagnie Generate are also interested in the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha of Tokio, and they have become the sponsors, jointly with the German Company, of a new associated Company in Italy known asSocieta Italo-Radio.A noticeable feature of the French service is the rapid increase which has taken place in the volume of business, as. experience is gained in the management of high-power stations and improvements are. made in the methods of transmission.Wireless Telegraphy in Germany.Germany had the most highly developed system of wireless in existence before the. war, and was able to communicate, directly with Wmdhuk in German West Africa, with the Cameroons and with America! During the war the German stations issued 1,000 words of propaganda daily.The principal high-power stations are those at Nauen, near Berlin, and- Eilyese, near. Hanover, which are owned by the GeseUsehait. fur llrahtlose Telegraphie and are operated by a subsidiary company.. They have been, greatly improved and. enlarged, since the waft, and are now, used mainly for communication with corresponding&quot;stations in the United States. A third station for operation with tho Radio, Corporation station at Long Island was opened a short time ago. These stations&apos; also proactcast news, messages (in German and in English), to, the, Argentine (tor distribution, m South America), to New York, to M&apos;adtid.(in, Spanjsh),; ,.1,0, WWna (in, French, and German).   TJhey also, send news, fjftall
stations in Dutch, probably with the view of reaching Dutch colonies. In addition the Eilvese station carries on a commercial service with Cairo, while the Nauen station is probably being used for communication with the recently opened high-power station in the Argentine, which was erected by the German company.-There is also a medium-power installation at Nauen which is used for communication with Spain, Italy,. Bulgaria, Roumania and Russia. Apart from the privately-owned system, the German Government own and operate a medium-power station at Kdnigs-Wusterhausen, near Berlin, which is used for communication with London, Budapest, Sofia and Sarajevo (Jugo-Slavia).Wireless Telegbaphy in Italy.Italy. Italy possesses long-range stations at Coltano and Rome capable of communicating with her colonies in North-East Africa, the Colonial stations being at Mogadicio (Italian Somaliland) and Massaua (in Erythrea), and with the United States of America.The Government have recently concluded an Agreement with a new company known as Societa Italo-Radio, which has secured a concession for 23 years, under which the Company has taken over the existing Government stations in Italy. The agreement provides for the erection of new stations for internal and foreign services. The Compagnie Generate of Erance and the Gesellschaft fur Drahtlose Telegraphie of Germany are interested in this Company, and have undertaken to secure the admission of the new Company to the international wireless combine, of which the Marconi Company and Radio Corporation are the remaining members.The four world companies: the Marconi Company, the German com-pany, the French company, and the Radio Corporation of America, have a pooling arrangement with regard to patents, the Marconi Company thus obtaining the British rights on all patents belonging to the combine. Each company has research departments occupied in developing patents and making new improvements. The largest of all is that carried on by the General Electric Company of America. The big four have entered into a &quot; Consortium &quot; Agreement for the formation of National Wireless Companies throughout South America. One of the &quot; National&quot;. Com-panies formed is the Argentine National Company, which has recently completed a new high-power station at Monte Grande, near Buenos Aires. A Brazilian National Company has also been formed, but has not made much progress.Wireless Telegbaphy m United States.United States The principal commercial wireless company in the United States is of America. the Radio Corporation, which has a practical monopoly of commercial wireless telegraphy. Theoretically competition is free, but in practice the Radio Corporation and its associated companies, which include the General Electric Company of America and other large American electrical companies, control the whole of the long distance commercial services. The principal stations owned by the Radio Corporation are those at Long Island, New Jersey (Mass.), New Brunswick and Tuckerton (New Jersey) comprising six different transmitting installations (one spare) with corresponding receiving stations-all operated from their Central Radio Office, New York, which carry on the services with this country, Norway, Germany, France, and Poland; and Bolinas (San Francisco) and Kahuku (Honolulu), which are used for commnnieation. with Japan. These services have probably made some inroads into the cable traffic, mainly in connection with the direct exchange of traffic between the United States and European countries, such as Gsrmany and Norway,
which, are not directly connected by cable, and between the United States and Japan, where the cable facilities are costly and not very satisfactory. It is difficult to disentangle the financial results of. the trans-Oceanic communications from the rest of the wireless activities of the Company.Apart from the privately-owned stations, the United States Navy own and operate 10 high-power stations at the following places : Annapolis (Maryland), Balboa (Panama), Darien, Arlington (Virginia), Guam, Sayville (Long Island), San Diego (California), Honolulu, Cavite (Philip, pines), and Puget Sound (Pacific Coast). These are used for United States Government purposes.
