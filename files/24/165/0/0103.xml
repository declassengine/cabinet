685PHIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.-P&apos;CRET:.V. 199 (24) CABINET.(HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE).     , &apos;SALE OP BREAD BILL. Memorandurn by the President of the Board of Trade. For the last hundred years the sale of Bread has been regulated by the Bread Acts of 1822 and 1836, the former of which applied to London, and the latter to the rest of Great Britain.   Under those Acts, all Bread (other than fancy &apos;bread or rolls) was required to be sold by weight, but loaves might be of any weight; these provisions failed to give protection to the purchaser who bought his bread by the loaf and not by the pound.During the war the Pood Controller made an Order called the-Bread Order, 1917, which provided that no loaf should be sold unless its i/seight were one pound or an even number of poundsj this provision is still in force being contained in Part I of the Sale of Pood Order, 1921, as amended by the Amending Order of 14th December, 1921.   This Order was made under the temporary powers conferred by the Ministry of Pood (Continuance) Act, 1920, and has been kept in force by the Expiring Laws Acts: as at present, it remains till December, 1924.   Mr. Clynes, when Pood Controller, gave an assurance that careful consideration would be given to a proposal for . permanent legislation of this kind, and in the autumn of 1920 an Inter-departmental Committee was appointed to consider the provisions of the Bread Acts and ^the Bread Order in the light of experience gained in the administration^ of the Order. The Committee (which was presided over by Lord Rathcreedan, and included among its members three Members of the House of Commons) recommended that the principle of a fixed minimum weight for the loaf should be embodied in an Act of Parliament,
Local Authorities in all parts of England, including the most important towns, passed resolutions approving the Committee&apos;s recommendations, and urging the Government to introduce legislation to give effect to them, and the Board also received important deputations urging the necessity for such legislation.A Bill following the provisions of the Order and the recommendations of the Committee was accordingly introduced by Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Government on 28th June, 1922,    The Scottish Application Clause provided that the pan loaf, French Loaf, crusty loaf and any loaf of a similar character should not be excluded (under the heading of &quot;fancy bread&quot;) from the provisions of the Bill.     This was in accordance with the views of the Local Authorities of the largest Burghs and of the counties in Scotland.     It was, however, objected to by the Bakers.     The Home Affairs Committee, in view of this element of contentiousness, deferred further consideration of the Bill and it accordingly made no progress.In view of the recommendation, of the Rathcreedan Committee, the strong opinion of the local authorities, and the satisfactory working of the existing Bread Order, it is desirable that permanent legislation on the subject should be enacted.     I therefore desire authority to introduce a Bill for this purpose on the lines of the attached draft.     It will be seen that the draft includes Scotland and contains a pro-vision to give the protection of the Bill to the sale in    c Scotland of pan loaves, French loaves and loaves of a similar character, the pan loaf and the French loaf (which differs from the English French loaf) being in common use in Scotland. The working of the Act v/ill be in the hands of the local authorities.
The Rathereedan Committee recommended that the old Bread Acts (which deal with adulteration in addition to sale by weight) should be repealed and re-enacted.     It was.not found practicable to do this, but the 1922 Bill attempted to bring up to date the clauses in the Bread Acts relating to the provision and carriage of scales, so that all the regulations relating to weight would be contained in one Act with the result of a great simplification of the law.The clause intended to effect this object however represented a considerable weakening of the law as regards the carrying of weighing instruments on vehicles delivering bread outside the London area, and the local authorities strongly objected to it on that ground.     If the Clause were amended to meet the. views of the local authorities, it would be opposed by the bakers.     It has been considered desirable therefore to omit from the present draft the clause relating to the provision of scales, and to allow the existing enactments on the subject to remain in operation.As compared with the 1922 Bill, the present draft con-tains a number of changes designed either.to meet points of criticism which arose at the time, or to improve the Bill from the administrative point of view.As stated above, the existing regulations have been kept in fores by the maintenance of a Food Order under the ^^^^-T Laws Acts and the continuance of such regulations under those Acts will become increasingly difficult.     It is therefore of great urgency that the Bill should be introduced and passed into lavi at an early date.The Board of Trade and the Scottish Office are agreed as to the desirability and urgency of the proposed legislation.Board of Trade,19th march, 1924.
