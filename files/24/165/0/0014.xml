Rescission	of the Poplar Order.1     frfif 1       &apos;Memorandum by the Minister of Health.My aotion in rescinding the Poplar Order has been so gravely misunderstood and so grossly misinterpreted that it will be well in the first Instance to narrow the Issues down so as to see exactly what I have done and what I have not done, and what my action implies and what it does not imply.In the first place I have expressed no opinion whatever in regard to the question of the Poplar minimum wage for era-ployees of the Borough Council, which was the subject of a surcharge made by the auditor and of a decision by the High Court.    As an appeal has been entered against the High Court decision it would have been obviously Improper for me to ex-ipress any opinion at all on this point, and I explicitly de--dined to do so and carefully avoided any indication of either sympathy or the reverse with the Council and the Guardians insthis matter.     As regards the difficult and debateable question as to how far in assiting the needs of applicants for relief Guardians should take into account the earnings of other members of the household, I declined to give a deoision until I had further considered the matter.     I not unnaturally expressed some sympathy with the motives which actuated the Board of Guardians in this matter.    It should be remembered that this1is a very difficult question, and that many Boards of Guardians besides Poplar have felt it unreasonable to insist upon taking into account the whole of the earnings and income of e^ry member I        of the household.The one and the only aotual decision that I gave wasthe decision to rescind the special peremptory Poplar Order of June, 1922.   This Order was made by Sir Alfred Mond.     It was
made under the powers   given by Section 52 of the Poor Law VAmendment Act of 1834.   The effect of the Order was to pro-hiblt the Poplar Board of Guardians from giving relief In excess of a prescribed scale, but the statute under&quot;which it was made definitely provides that &quot;In case the Overseers or &quot;Guardians of any parish or union in which such orders or &quot;regulations shall be in force shall depart from them or any &quot;of them In any particular Instance or instances of emergency, &quot;and shall within fifteen days after every such departure re-&quot;port the same and the grounds thereof to the said Commissioners, &quot;and the said Commissioners shall approve of such departure, or, &quot;if the relief so given shall have been given in food, temporary &quot;lodging, or medicine and shall have been so reported as aforesaid &quot;then and In either of such cases the relief granted by suoh &quot;Overseers or Guardians, if otherwise lawful, shall not be unlaw-&quot;ful or subject to be disallowed&quot;.   The Poplar Guardians after the issue of the Mond Order proceeded to report to the Ministry several hundreds of cases a week as being cases which fell within the above quoted proviso,   The Ministry, while making some concessions in certain classes of cases, refused to give any-general approval to the departures, and therefore under the order the relief given in the vast majority of these cases in excess of the scale prescribed would be technically liable to surcharge and disallowance.   It Is estimated that if such surcharges had in fact been made they would amount to something like  2,000 a week or (say)  100,000 a year: obviously a preposterously impossible amount to surcharge upon the Guardians of a union like Poplar.I have little doubt that Sir Alfred Mond issued theOrder under the impression that the Guardians would obey it. Expressions used by leaders of the Board of Guardians led ttim to believe that while their election pledges precluded them from altering their policy of their own volition or under Persuasion, they would comply under protest with a peremptory Or.&apos;er having the force of lnw issued by the Minister
gof Health.As everyone knows, Sir Alfred Mond&apos;s expectations were disappointed, and the Order from the day  of its Issue has been wholly ineffective and inoperative.   The Order was ineffective because, as pointed out above and as explicitly stated by Sir Reginalds-, Blair, chairman of the London Municipal Society and National Union of Ratepayers&apos; Associations, it could not bo enforced.   Sir Reginald Blair is reported in &quot;The Times&quot; of the 8th of February to have said &quot;The ratepayers are called upon to pay  100,000,    which &quot;might have been surcharged upon the Guardians.    The Guardians &quot;probably could not have found 5,000 pence towards the surcharge, &quot;and would no doubt have gone to prison rather than pay a penny. &quot;Therefore, Sir Alfred Mond&apos;s attempted restriction was no pro-&quot;tection at all to the ratepayers, who pay in any case.&quot;As a matter of fact neither Sir Alfred Mond, nor any of his three successors, Sir A   Griffith Bosoawen, Mr. Neville 3haraberlain and Sir W. Joynson-Hioks, over took any aotion to enforce the order, although the departmental records show that the position was fully explained to each of them.   It is only fair, however, to say that the substitution of a flat rate for aiscale which was effected by the Local Authorities (Emergency Pro-ipisions) Act, 1923, was regarded by Mr. Chamberlain as tending, and lias In fact tended, to bring home to the minds of the Poplar Guardians pat the whole of their expenditure on relief in excess of the flat rate would fall upon the Poplar ratepayers alone.The truth is that ray predecessors recognised that It fas impracticable to enforce the Order, and that as Mr. Asqulth said pi his speech on the 13th Instant, &quot;the present sanotion of the flaw, namely the power of surcharge, is Inadequate and illusory&quot;.No better evidence can be given of the impossible position which the Ministry was placed than the record of the financial ^assistance which, quite properly, my predecessors felt bound mo give to Poplar,   In spite of Poplar&apos;s   defiance of the Order. set was clear to them that the use of the financial weapon forShe purpose of coercing poplar could not be attempted untili &apos; -^hey had obtained legislative powers to supersede the Board of
Guardians,The Order came into force in June, 1922.     In respect of thefirst: half-year during which the Order was in force, i.e.the half-yearended the 50th September, 1922,no surcharges have been made but In threocases selected as typical, Guardians have boon notified that a surchargeis proposed.    (The audit is not yet completed).For the half-year ended i 31st March71925,,no surcharges have been made, but in respect of this half&quot;year also notice of proposedsurcharges has been given by the atiditor in threo cases,(This auditalso is not yet completed.The audit for the half-year ended 50th September,1925.isonly being opened this weok.Having come to the conclusion, which was evidently shared by my predecessors, that the Order could never be enforced, I was facedwith the alternative of keeping alive a useless sham, the existence ofiwhich was embarrassing, if not degrading to my Department, or of rescinding the Order and clearing the way for a sane and practical polijyRealising the failure of the Order to accomplish what they wished to achieve, two of my predecessors had in mind drastic action of a nature which I think would not appeal to my colleagues or to the present House of Commons. Sir Alfred Mond contemplated, and Sir W.Joynaon-Hicks proposed the introduction of a Bill conferring on the Minister power &apos;to supersede any defaulting or recalcitrant Board of Guardians.I could not assent, and I do not believe that the cabinet would assent to such an invasion of the principles of local government,Ihe real remedy for Poplar does not lie in this direction, and it is-certainly not to be found in the preservation of the futile Order of 1922Any Government that wishes to deal with Poplar will have to deal with t-h;whole question of London Government, or at any rate of London Poor*^aw, on a comprehensive basis, and I wish to draw the special attention of the Cabinet to the observations on this subject which Mr. Asquith [made on the 15th February.Mr, Asquith concluded his speech by pressing the Government [to add to the list of useful legislative and administrative charges (1) 1* real reform of London Government, and (2) a reconsideration of the is of the Poor Law itself.-4-
So far as those reforms are-re&apos;levan1^to-the- particular- que-stlon at issue, they are so linked together as to be barely distinguishable. Any such reforms must, it would seem, follow the general lines of one of three Reports, namely (1) the Majority Report of the Koyal Commission on the Poor Laws, (2) the Minority Report of the Royal Commission on ths Poor Laws, and (3) the Report of the Maclea/&amp; Committee.While differing In certain details and differing perhaps in the way In which the proposed administrative machine would work, all theso three plans and almost all the variants of them which havo been proposed elsewhere aro broadly of a single pattern.     They all In offset propose the abolition of the separate bodies of Poor Law Guardians in London and the creation of a Central Poor Law Authority, but with somewhat different ideas as to how tho control Body should work locally and to what extent looal administration of outdoor relief should bo entrusted either to purely local Committees of tho Central Body or to tho Metropolitan Borough Councils.The Labour Party have consistently been in favour of reform of the Poor Laws both In London and elsewhere,   and no doubt the present Government would be   very glad to Initiate and carry through such a reform If thoy could bo assured of sufficient support from the other parties.But while it may be said that both the Conservative and the Liberal Parties have at times indicated their sympathy with the proposals of reform, it is significant that during all the time thoso other Parties have boon in power no practical steps have been taken in this direction.My critlos, however, are far from contenting themselves with attacks upon what I have a one.     Their most vigorous assaults aro directed upon the policy which my action is supposed to imply and tho future actions which it is supposed   to portend. hu3,   it is suggested that &quot;the Poplar Guardians aro left with uncontrolled discretion.&quot;      &quot;The Poplar decision  *      *      * promised to those who would not work maintenance or relief at
&quot;the rate of full pay&quot;.   I? this decision stands there *1B an end of Departmental control over local authorities -who are inclined to put communism in rractice&quot;.There is, of course, not the slightest foundation for any of these grotesque assumptions,   As pointed out in the statement issued toy the Minister of Health which appeared in the papers on February 9th, the action taken does not involve or imply any alteration in general poor lav; policy.    The poplar Board of Guardians will remain in exactly the same position as any other Board of Guardians in the country and will be subject to precisely the same limitations and restrictions.    Any expenditure on relief which is excessive or otherwise unlawful, whether incurred toy the Poplar or any other Board of Guardians will continue to be liable to disallowance and surcharge.It is suggested in some quarters that this Is an after-thought and in other quarters that at any rate, the Poplar Guardians will not interpret it in this way.   To confute these two suggestions, if confutation be needed, it will be sufficient to refer to one of the Poor Law service papers, namely, the Poor Law. Officers&apos; Journal,which, in its Issue of the 8th February, i,e, the day before the official statement says &quot;The dally press has been full of &quot;exaggerated comments upon the Minister of Health&apos;s new &quot;poplar decision.     It has been &quot;displayed&apos; in the largest &quot;of types and discussed with a wealth of sarcasm and &quot;hostility that matches the ignorance with which the bulk &quot;of it is impregnated.     The truth is that up to the moment &quot;the poplar Guardians have done nothing that can be called &quot;illegal, and the new action of the Minister is little more &quot;than severely technical, whether one regards its form or its scope&quot;,      An&amp; iater on the artiole oontinUeS &quot;me law &quot;has not been altered, the discretion of the Guardians&apos; &quot;stands, and the powers of the Ministry of Health remain as
&quot;defined by statute.   There has been no red revolution, and      1 (] &quot;the only alteration in the situation Is the removal of an &quot;exceptional legal document,, the validity of which, at any &quot;rate in parts, was open to legal argument&quot;*So far as the attitude of the Poplar Board of Guardians to the decision is concerned, it will be sufficient to quote Mr.Edgar Lansbury as reported in &quot;The Times&quot; of the 11th of February; &quot;the action of Mr.Wheatley last Tuesday merely &quot;cleared the ground, which was cumbered by all sorts cf orders &quot;and regulations never being carried out&quot;. :,When the * precious &quot;order was swept away the present law of the land still applied, &quot;and if members of a board of guardians sanctioned relief which &quot;was considered by a Court of law to be more than sitftfickent to &quot;relieve the destitution of the applicant they could be taken to &quot; a Court of law by the auditor of the Ministry of Health an &quot;made to refund the money.   They could be surcharged by the &quot;auditor of the Ministry of Health whatever they paid in relief &quot;which was more than what he considered..to be adequate.,   It was &quot;all humbug to talk as if Mr*Wheatley5s action opened another &quot;field by which the Boards cf Guardians were going to become &quot;extravagant and wasteful&quot;&apos;..-The motion tabled by the Liberal party suggests that the rescission of the poplar-Order is calculated to encourage illegal! and extravagance.     My answer Is that you are much more likely tc encourage illegality b* keeping alive a statutory order which you cannot enforce and which everybody knows you cannot enfor.ee., which the Guardians have defied since the dfj it was made and which they have defied with complete impunity.There is this toe to be said on the question of extravagance,   poplar have in fact been mending their ways, not on account of the Mond Order, but owing to the pressure of the local rate burden,   The Poplar relief scale is at the presafit time lower than that of some other boards of guardians,West Ham, for examplej and while the Poplar scale may not be &quot;less by ten
m&quot;shillings a week than the standard rate of wages for the time &quot;being recommended for workpeople of Grade A under the agreement &quot;of the London District Industrial Council for non-trading &quot;services (manual labour)&quot; (vide Schedule 1 (ii) of the Mond. Order) yet I am informed by my officers that in an appreciable number of cases the Poplar Guardians are now actually giving less relief than they would be entitled to give under the Mond scale.I append to the Memorandum a statement explaining the legal position and setting out briefly the chronological sequence of events leading up to and following the Issue of the Poplar Order.     This statement could if thought desirable be issued as a White Paper.For the purposes of debate I suggest that the explana-tion given should be based generally upon the facts and arguments set out In this Memorandum, and further that an explicit assurence should be given that the Government mean to carry out the law as they find it and that they have no intention whatever of encouraging or allowing lax administration.     At the same time, the undertaking, given by the Prime Minister on Thursday last, that the Government will take up the question-of London Government with special reference to London Poor Law, with a view to formulating proposals for a comprehensive reform, might be repeated.(Intd.)    J. W.try of Health.10th February, 1924.
RESCISSION   OP   THE   POPLAR   ORDER. Memorandum by the Ministry of Health.1. Statement as to the Legal Position.Section 52 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, gives the Minister of Health, as the successor of the Poor Law Ctmmlssioners, a special power of declaring by rules, orders or regulations to what extent and for what period outdoor relief, In money or in kind, or partly in money and partly in kind, may be administered in any particular Parish or Union, and in what manner such outdoor relief may be afforded.    The section also provides that all relief given contrary to such orders or regulations shall be unlawful and shall be disallowed In the accounts of the person giving the same, subject to certain ex-eeptions contained in the provisos   to the section.     Of these exceptions, the only one which is material is that contained in the last proviso, which legalises (If otherwise lawful) departures from the orders or regulations in cases of emergency subject to a report within 15 days of the departure and the grounds thereof to the Minister and to the approval by the Minister of the departure, or in the case of relief given in food, temporary lodging or medicine, subject only to the report of the case to the Minister.The Relief Regulation (Poplar) Order, 1922, was issued in.June, 1922, under the enactment above-mentioned. Briefly, the effect of the Order was to prohibit the Guerdians of the Parish of Poplar from giving outdoor relief to an able-bodied person or to any member of the family of such a person, of such an amount as would raise the weekly income of the applicant, or of the household -(a)   beyond the scale shewn   at the foot of page 1 of     * the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund (Outdoor Relief) Regulations
(b)   beyond a sum less by 10s. a week than the standard rate of wages? for the time being recommended for workpeople of Grade, A. under the agreement of the London District Industrial Council for non-trading services (manual labour).The restriction was based on whichever of the two sums already mentioned was the less of the two.The Metropolitan Common Poor Fund (Outdoor Relief) Regulations of 1922 were framed under section 1 of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, which provided for the equalisation over London, for a temporary period, of the expenses of Guardians in respect of outdoor relief, by means of its repayment from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund.     Sub-section (2) of the section forbade the repayment of relief granted in excess of such scale, or in contravention of such conditions as were to be prescribed by regulations of the Minister of Health,By section 1 of the Local Authorities (Emergency Fro-vislons) Act, 1923, section 1 of the Act of 1921 was continued in force until the 1st April, 1924*     But paragraph (b) of S.1/1923 substituted for subsection (2.) of S,l/l921 an enactment providing that the expenses to be repaid from the Common Poor Fund in respect of outdoor relief should be an amount not exceeding 9d. for each person in respect of whom outdoor relief is granted, for each day for which such relief is granted in respect of him.A flat rate of 9d. a day was thus substituted for the scale to be prescribed by the Minister under S,l(2)/l921, and the repeal of that subsection is held to have revoked ipso facto the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund Regulations of 1922, which were issued under the authority of that subsection.The rescission of the Relief Regulation (Poplar) Order 1922, does not remove from the district auditor&apos;s review outdoor
relief granted by the Poplar Guardians.    The obligation of the auditor under S.52 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, . to disallow outdoor relief given contrary to the special regu-latlons issued under that section disappears, but the general powers of the auditor under section 32 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1844, to examine, audit, allow or disallow of accounts, and of items therein, relating to moneys assessed for and applicable to the relief of the poor, and to surcharge any person making or authorising an illegal payment, remains unaffected by the rescission of the Relief Regulation (Poplar) Order, 1922.Copies of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund (Outdoor Relief) Regulations and of the Relief Regulation (Poplar) Order are appended.2. Historical Summary. The following statement of facts, in chronological sequence, will perhaps serve to make the position clearer.In 1920 and 1921 representations were made to the Ministry of Health to the effect that the poorer parts of the Metropolis were carrying an increasingly heavy financial burden and specific requests wore made to the Government to take steps to introduce legislation fap the purpose of (1) bringing to an end the stereotyping of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund which had been adopted during the War period, and (2) making further provision for spreading the charges falling upon the ratepayers over the whole of London.The Ministry undertook to,give these matters careful consideration, but matters were brought to a head by the action of the Poplar Boroutrh Council In refusing to meet the precepts addressed to them by the London County Council and by the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Receiver of the Metro-politan Police.    Application was made to the Court by the County Council and Asfluma Board and a mandamus was granted agalnsttho Borough
Councillors. The Borough Councillors refused to obey the 107 Order and were committed for contempt.They were subsequently released, and the Government decided not only to abandon the stereotyping of the Hetro-popitan Common Poor Fund but to approach the local authorities of the richer p.arts of London with a view to seeing whether some agreement could, be reached whereby these authorities would assume a larger share of the&apos; rate burden of the Metro--&apos; polls and a further equalisation of the cost of certain services bo effected.    As a result of those negotiations, it was agreed that the charge in respect of indoor relief which could be claimed from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund should be increased from 5d. to l/3d. per head per day and that the dost of outdoor relief should be charged on the Bund within t*ie limits of a scale and subject to conditions to be proscribed by the Minister of Health,The effect of this agreement was embodied in the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, and, in accordance with the provisions of that Act regulations con-tainirig the prescribed scale and conditions were issued on the 4th January, 1982.In February, 1928, the Ministry was informed that tho Guardians anticipated that an overdraft of  148,250 which had been sanctioned in the previous December was likely to be exhausted before the end of the half-year and that the Guardians would require a further overdraft to enable them to meet their current expenditure.     In view of the serious financial position of the Parish, as thus disoloaed, the Minister decided that an Inquiry should behold into the expenditure of the Guardians &quot;with a view to securing, without delay, such economies as are consistent with efficient,&apos; administration&quot;, and he appointed Ifr&apos;, n.I. Cooper, clerk to the Guardians of the Bolton Union.? ao the Commissioner to hold the inquiry.     llr. Cooper made hie Report on the 10th of
lay, 1922, and the Minister invited the observations of the guardians upon it.The uuardiana* reply was not received for some weeks but meantime they had applied for a further loan as an advance in respect of sums to be subsequently received from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund.     It should be explained   -that the Local Authorities (Flnanoial Provisions) Act, 1921, gave authority to Local Authorities to borrow, with the con-sent of the Minister and by way of temporary loans or over-drafts or otherwise, sums temporarily required for current expenses, and &quot;provided that the interests on sums &quot;borrowed in order to defray expenses ultimately chargeable on the Metro-poll tan Common Poor Fund should be repaid out of that Fund..On the 14th June, 1922, the Guardians sent a reply which -the Minister regarded as unsatisfactory, and, after receiving a deputation from the Guardians on the 20th June, he decided to i&amp;also a Special Order, under the authority of Section 52 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834, providing that in the c-aeo of the Poplar Union relief which might legally be given to an able-bodied person or any member of his family uhould not be legal if it exceeded the scale or   . contravened the conditions laid down In the Regulations of 4th January, 1932.This Order was Issued on 20th June, 1922, and came into force on 1st July, 1922.A further deputation which was reoeived by the i-lnister on the 38th June, urged that it would be impossible to carry on the administration of relief on the lines of the Order, but undertook that all oases in contravention should be reported for approval with a statement of the grounds and the klnister then promised that advances should be sanctioned to the extent necessary to enable relief to be administered in accordance with the Order.The Guardians continued to grant relief on the - 5 -
lines, &apos;or:rviouialy existing and reported departures from the Order in a very large proportion of their oases.     For a week or t.;o, pending the submission and consideration of the Guardians&apos; reasons the departures were allowed, but the Mini tor, while making concessions as regards cases where the families were unusually large, or the extra relief was for the provision of boots or olothing and in some cases of disability pensions, declined to acquiesce in any general modification of the Order.The grant of relief in numerous cases in contravention of the Order has continued up to the present month.    The last list reoeived was fortfarded on 2nd February, 1924, and included 901 cases in which the scale has been exceeded.    No further sanction to departures has been given*The Metropolitan Common Poor Fund provisions of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, were United in duration until the end of December, 1922, and on 17th hay, 1925. the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1923, was passed continuing the operation of these pro-visions until the 1st April, 1924, with certain modifications the host important being the substitution of a flat rate of 9d* per person per day aa the amount which might be charged on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund in respect of Out-relief for the conditional scale charges previously authorised.The ucaleof relief to able-bodied unemployed personsin Poplar has recently been reduced and is now as followsd .d.Adults not living with parents ....... 12,8 per week.Married couples or t?	ro adults		11	itMarried couples with			n	11ditto	two children	.... 30.0	11	itditto	three    &quot;	....

In addition the actual rent is given (limited to 5s. in the case of a single furnished room), with a coal allowance of ls.f?d. per week.     Clothes may also he granted in medical oases and boots in the case of children attending school. In calculating the Income of the household the Guardians count as income:-(l)   the whole of the unemployment benefit;(3)   the whole of the parents&apos; earnings;(3)   any service pension, or any mother&apos;s pension in respect of a son or other relative, over 10/-J(4)   any reserve pay;(5)   a proportion of children1s earnings above 15/-, varying from lo. where such earnings are under 17s*c&apos;d* to 12s, where the earnings are under 50sr.f with an addition of 50$ of anything earned over 50s.It should he added that since November, 1921, monies have been voted by Parliament to enable the Minister to make advances by way of loan to Boards of Guardians to meet current expenditure in oases where the Guardians are unable to do so unaided.     Such advances are made cn the recommendation of the Committee presided over by Sir Harry Gooohen.     In the, particular case of Poplar tho Committee recommend that advances should be made in anticipation of repayments from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund which under the machinery of the fund are made over twelve months&apos; in arrear.     Thssa advances have been restricted to the extent of the out-1 standing claim of the Guardians on the Fund and have been made from time to time to an amount not exceeding the estimated legal expenditure of the Guardians.The first advance was made in April, 1982, and the last advance in July, 192.3, and tho amount of advances outstanding is  506,500.i 7 -
