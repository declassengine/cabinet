(THIS DOGUMiSaT IS THE ISO PERT Y Of HIS BRITAHHIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT)S &amp; CRM CP- 178(24).CiBI M B ISINGAPORE naval BASE.Gqpv of telegrams from the Dominion Governments.I.Governor--General of Canada to Secretary of State for the Colonies.     10th March, 1924,following from Mr. Mackenzie King for Prime Minister begins:   Replying to your telegram of the 5th March. The stand taken by the Canadian representatives at the Imperial Conference last year was that they were not in a position to offer any advice as to the necessity for establishing a Naval Base at Singapore and that they were therefore unwilling to join in any recommendations with respect thereto which might be presumed to commit the Government then existing or any subsequent Government. My colleagues and I do not in the circumstances feel that proposed statement of policy outlined in the despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the 6th March calls for any comment on our part.   Ends.Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, March 11th, 1924.My Prime Minister sends following message begins: Singapore Base.   Your two secret telegrams of March 6th my Government have most carefully considered Draft state ment of policy prepared by you for announcement inBYNG.II.
AMft% a oParliament.   The sentiment underlying your declaration that you stand for a &quot;polloy of International co-operation through the- strengthened and enlarged league of Nations the settlement of disputes by Judicial arbitration and conciliation and the creation of conditions which will make possible a comprehansive agreement on limitation of armament&quot; is one which we cordially endorse.We in Australia are essentially a peaoe loving people and we have shown that we desire a better under-standing&apos; among the nations and a definite reduction of armaments on every possible occasion at the meetings of the League of Hations at the Washington Conference and by our prompt oompliqnoe with all resolutions arising therefrom.   We are attempting to develop a vast territory with a mere handful of people.and our&quot;economic circum-stances are those peculiar, to.every young community in such a position   This impels us to devote as much of our&quot; money and energy as possible to permanent re-productive works rather than to armaments,quite apart from our deep rooted national conviction intensified by experience and naorifices in the late war that the time has oome when mankind should substitute arbitrament of reason for that of forced --&apos; We are in sympathy therefore with the great ideals expressed in your: telegrams, from every standpoint and we will continue to.work for their realisation.The methods suggested by you are however in the carefully considered-view of my Government such as will have precisely the opposite effect and we feel that th3 &apos;prospects of ultimately achieving that aim for which we &quot;are all assiduously working will in fact be seriously jeopardised;:
We believe that the existense and prestige of the British Esapire has.been-and Is the greatest factor in the maintenance of the peaco of the world.To the active support backed by prestige and strength of the British Empire has been due the measure of success which has been achieved by the league of Nations sinae its inception,,Our strength relative to other great powers has been the basis of the Influence- lor peace which we have wielded In the councils of the nations and through the league of Nations^That strength has depended&apos;mainly on the British Navy, its power and mobility. - We are convinced a base in the - Pacific is.imperative for that mobility.The existence and prestige of the Empire will be imperilled without it, .. S?e believe-that such a result would be a menace to the peace- of the world and a fatal- blow to the league of Nations-,-Tour view that confidence must be established and that this can,---only be achieved by allaying the international anxieties and suspicions which exist&apos; today is one :-lh which we also concur,   -We cannot agree-however that the establish--ment of that confidence would be any more hampered by the prudent step of establishing&apos; Singapore base for the protec-tion of the Empire&apos;s trade and possessions&apos; in the.Pacific than by the other prudent-;step which your Government is.&apos;: undertaking&apos; to increase -Britainrs Air Forces as.a. protection against, air attack.,. -,.   .- --.     ., .Further, we wo^ld point out   that, it was at the Washington Conference, which arose primarily out of Pacific
problems, that the greatest contribution yet made to disarmament was effected.   At that Conference a stage of mutual understanding and trust, remarkable in the cir-oumstanoes and unprecedented in history, was reached by the nations there represented.   This result was achieved - in spite of the fact that all the nations represented atthe Conference knew well that it was Britainfs intention tovproceed with the construction of the base at Singapore arid that because of that well known intention of Britain. Singapore was excluded from the area where fortifications could not be erected. ,She arrangement concluded at Washington   for the &apos;reduction of armaments was reached notwithstanding the knowledge of Britain^ intention bo proceed with a prudent  , measure of self-protection and my Government does not believe that a further reduction of armaments, which all of us so greatly desire, will   be prevented by this prudent measure being taken at the present time.We think, on the contrary, that, if the proposal, which the highest naval authorities of the Empire support as a necessary defensive measure, is abandoned by your Government, incalculable harm will be done to the 3mpireTs prestige, the confidence of smaller nations will be shattered, the ambitions of lesser powers will be increased, and deep . distrust will be caused throughout the whole Empire.   Not by actions having, such restilts as these can we hope to bring about further reductions in armaments.further/ unless we have a base in the Pacific, that     0 quota of capital ships permitted by the Washington Conference cannot be maintained by Britain in these now important waterSo &apos;
That Conferanoe never contemplated this eventuality the occurrence of whioh would necessarily destroy the influ-ence and power cf the British Empire in the Pacific to secure further reductions of ilaval Armaments.While, therefore, we appreciate your desire to promote a friendly understanding amongst the nations, we do not agree that the oarrying out of a programme so long and widely known and so essential to altered circumstances would refleot on your good faith, or that it would jeopardise the establishment of that oonfidenoe necessary to success.As a more practical contribution to the principles which you have enunciated and with which we cordially agree we suggest that the construction of the base should he immediately proceeded with but that, should a suitable opportunity offer itself, the abandonment of the base should be used as a means of reaching an agreement for further mutual reductions of armamentsoTherefore, on behalf of our Commonwealth, which has on every possible occasion proved its loyalty to the Empire, we urge you even at this late hour to reconsider your decision.The question of the oost of the base has not been referred to by me, because I believe your determination has been reached on the basis of principle and not of expend!-ture.   But I wish to make it clear that its obligation to contribute towards the cost of the base is recognised by Australia, and it is the intention of my Government tc submit to Parliament, as goon as it meets, proposals for a* substantial Australian contribution. .

Governor-General of Mew, Zealand to Secretary of State for the Colonies, March 11th, 1924&apos;,. Please communicate following message to Prime Minister-from ray Prime Minister   begins   With reference to the decision arrived at by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to proposed. Singapore naval base- conveyed in your cypher telegram of 6th March I regret exceedingly that it is not the intention cf the Government of United Kingdom to proceed with this proposal which is looked upon as one of the most important connected with the defence of the Empire.     It has been stated in.no uncertain terms by the foremost naval authorities available that without a properly equipped base.a modern fleet cannot operate and, in the opinion of these authorities, for the protection of those portions of the Empire, which are situated in the Pacific and Indian Oceans there is no place so suitable as that which may be . provided at Singapore.     This matter Intensely concerns Australia, India, New Zealand and a number of Crown Colonies who are looking to present British Government to remember that every citizen of the Empire and every country of the Empire are entitled to pro-tection from possibility of attack by a foreign foe.     H is well to remember here that Singapore Is intended certainly not for offensive but for defensive purposes and that no more of a threat would be entailed to Japan by the establishment of a Naval Ba.se at Singapore than is entailed to the United States of America or any other foreign power by the existence of Gibraltar.Last Session the New Zealand Parliament as an earnest of its anxiety that the fortification.of. Singapore should be proceeded with voted one hundred thousand pounds and it will not stop at that. In recent years America has fortified Pearl Harbour in the Noith Pacific and it is now said by well qualified naval experts to be/impregnable
impregnable and naval position of America has been strength-thened accordingly.&apos;   The United States of America is fort-unately a friendly nation and will remain as such for centuries to come go far as It is possible to judge and I hope for .all time.     Separated from the heart of the Empire by thirteen thousand or fourteen thousand miles of Sea we in Kew Zealand realise what it means to be Insufficiently proteote We hove not forgotten what was suffered by the Royal Navy end the British Mercantile Marine In the Pacific during the years of the Great War and we had hoped that the lesson taught then would not be so quickly forgotten.You say that your Government stands for International co-operation through an enlarged and strengthened League of Hations.     I feel that I must reply to that by saying that it may turn out to have been a pity that the League, was ever brought into being if the defence, of the Empire is to depend upon the League of Nations only.    The.very existence of the Empire depends on the Imperial EsFvy and If the Navy Is to operate successfully in the event of war it must have suitable bases where repairs may be effected and from which to work. Malta is nearest suitable base at present and It is 6,000 miles away and therefore for the purposes of capital ships In either the Pacific or Indian Oceans it is of no value.     It has been said by an eminent authority that &quot;Unless such a base as that contemplated at Singapore is established it will be an absolute impossibility for the majority of Empire capital ships operate to the eastward of Suez for the simple reason that they cannot dock either for the purpose of cleaning and so keeping their speed or of being repaired.&quot;     It may also be pointed out that although, the League of Nations is undoubtedly/an
an influence for peace hostile actions as between nations has not so far been prevented by It.Owing to the alteration in ship designs since the Great Far I may remind you that dooks which before 1914 would have taken certain classes, of war ships will not now accommodate ships of similar tonnage and co the present standard of naval efficiency cannot be maintained without effect being given to the proposals regarding Singapore.I protect earnestly on behalf of Hew Zealand against the abandonment of the proposal to make Singapore a .safe and. strong naval station because I believe that the&apos; Empire will stand as long as Britain holds the supremacy of. the Sea but if Naval supremacy is lost by Britain the Empire may fall to the detriment of humanity as a whole as well as of its own: people and it is surely the duty of the British Parliament and British Ministers to see that there will be no danger of such a catastrophe so far as. it is humanly possible to prevent it Ends.JELLICOE,
Governor-General of South Africa to Secretary of Stato for the Colonies, March 7th, 1924.Secret.   7th March.    With referenoe to your Secret telegrams of 5th and 6th March Singapore,   following message from my Prime Minister to your Prime Minister begins.   Your proposed statement of policy meets with my wholehearted agreement. Purely on the grounds of naval strategy Singapore base nay be sound proposal but the authority of the British Empire as the protagonist of the great cause of appeasement and       , conciliation among the nations must be seriously undermined by it.    I expressed my misgivings on that ground at Imperial Conference and now welcome the abandonment of the scheme. Proposed base, while technically outside the limits of the Pacific pact made at Washington, would in fact only be of use within the prohibited area, It would,  therefore, be out of keeping with the spirit of Washington agreement. At a time when we should move forward with clean hands and unchallenged moral authority this would, be step backward.I would be loth to dissociate myself from the Prime Ministers of Australia and lew Zealand and I sincerely trust that your action will meet with their acquiescence, not only on grounds stated above but also because no promise of real security is contained for them in Singapore.;  for European troubles will probably synchronise with any future tension in the Pacific and make it out of the question to ,jJiove the whole or largo part of the British lavy to Singapore, Even from point, of view of their future security the better wsy is to make the bold move which you propose towards enduring peace conditions.

Governor of Newfoundland to Secretary of State for the Colonies, March 7th 1924,Seorat. 7th Max oh *   Careful consideration has been given by my prime Minister to your secret telegram of March 5th relative to Singapore base and to that of the sixth instant from the Prime Minister,   Warren emphatic that it would be unwise not to proce-ed with naval base Singapore in view of the cogent reasons laid before the Imperial ConferenceaGovernor0rm. .Governor of Straits Settlements to Secretary of State for the Colonies, March 9th 1924oNaval Base.With regard to your telegram 4th March I am unable to ensure that a verbal announcement in the legislative Council would be simultaneous with the Prime Ministers statement for supposing that March 18th were the date on which announcement in Parliament will be made Reuters telegram reporting at least the main fact would be published in the Singapore morning press of the 19th March,   If I made the statement public on the 18th I could not guarantee as local time is &quot; hours ahead of London that it would not be cabled, home before the announcement in Parliament, had ,:been made,   I consider that the best I can do is to issue written statement that, will be published here in the same issue of newspaper^ as . Reuters telegram.   lour telegram says nothing about the cost incurred by the Colony in acquiring the sites.   While eager to make the gift the unofficial members of the Council and the
general public will strongly resent the useless expenditure. My personal opinion is that is is essential that you should authorise ice to state that the Imperial Government will reimburse the actual amount paid by the Colony or the difference between that sum and what can be obtained by re-alienating the land.GUIIJiEMAPDoSI3Extract from paraphrase telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, 6th March, 1924.Secret.     In light of report by Cabinet Committee following draft.statement of policy regarding proposed naval base at Singapore has been drawn up for announcement In Parliament by Prime Minister.   Begins,(Statement, which has already been circulated, is omitted).Bate and final form of announcement at present uncertain as Dominion Governments are being consulted, but I hasten to inform yon of position as in view of the generosity of the Straits Settlements in. presenting required sites, I am anxious you should be in a position to inform legislative Council of decision simultaneously or as nearly as may be with statement in Parliament.   Of course it is essential that there should be no premature disclosure and that your statement should hot be cabled here in advance of Prime Minister!s announcement.   You should add, in communicating substance of announcement that His Majesty7s present advisers are no less sensible
than their predecessors of the patriotism and generosity of the Colony in their magnificent gift and that they desire most cordially to associate themselves with the warm appreciation conveyed to you by my predecessor of the Colony&apos;s lfberaiity0When date and form of announcement have been settled a further telegram will be sent to you.   In the meantime I, attach great importance to keeping decision and st at ement s e cret0Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., 12th March, 1924.
