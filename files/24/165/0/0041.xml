[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]    o f? fSPrinted for the Cabinet.SECRET.CP. 140 (24).CABINET.RESOLUTIONS OF THE IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WITH the assistance of a Committee representing all the Departments concerned, this memorandum has been prepared in accordance with Cabinet Conclusion 16 (24) 3 (C), of the 21st February, 1924.The Resolutions of the Imperial Economic Conference fall into four classes :(A.) Those Resolutions which can most conveniently be dealt with in connectionwith the Finance Bill.  -(B.)- Those Resolutions which would require other legislative provision. (C.) ThoseiResolutions which would only require administrative action. (D.) Those Resolutions oh which no action is required at present.[The numbers in brackets refer to those given in the &quot;Record of Proceedings,&quot; Cmd. 2009, pages 13-26.](A.)-Those Resolutions which can most conveniently be dealt with in connectionwith the Finance Bill.1. Tariff Preference (3 I).I have already circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum by Lord Arnold on the political aspects of the Preference question (CP. 112 (24)).The following is a summary of the conclusions reached at the Conference, and of the chief facts bearing on them : (I.) The Imperial Economic Conference adopted the following Resolution: &quot; This Imperial Economic Conference, holding that, especially in present circumstances, all possible means should be taken to develop the resources of the Empire and trade between the Empire countries, desires to reaffirm the Resolu-tion on the subject of Imperial Preference passed by the Imperial War conference it will be observed that this Resolution does not take the form of a recommenda-tion to Governments, but His .Majesty&apos;s Government may be invited to make in the House of Commons a declaration of their attitude in the matter.(II.) The Resolution of the 1917 Conference was as follows : &quot;The time has arrived when all possible encouragement should be given to the development of Imperial resources, and especially to making the Empire independent of other countries in respect of food supplies, raw materials and essential industries. With these objects in view this Conference expresses itself in favour of &quot;1. The principle that each part of the Empire, having due regard to the interests of our Allies, shall give specially favourable treatment and facilities to the produce and manufactures of other parts of the Empire.&quot; 2. Arrangements by which intending emigrants from the United Kingdom may be induced to settle in countries under the British flag.&quot; [11305]     &apos; B
This Resolution was intentionally passed in the widest possible terms so as to cover other forms of preference besides Tariff Preference.(III.) The late Government intimated at the Economic Conference that they intended to submit to Parliament certain specific proposals relating to Tariff Preference. These proposals are set out in paragraphs 4 to 6 of the &quot;Summary of Conclusions&quot; of the Conference (cmd.. 1990), and are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs./ should propose to notify the Dominion Governments of the attitude of Ilk Majesty&apos;s Government to these proposals immediately before any announcement is made in Parliament. -(a.) Dried Fruit now Dutiable (except Currants).(i.) These fruits comprise figs, raisins and plums (including apricots). The Conference proposal was to exempt such fruit of Empire origin from the present duty of 105. Qd. per cwt. This would have the effect of increasing the present preference of one-sixth, namely Is. M. per cwt., to the full rate of duty.(ii.) Special importance is attached to the proposals under this head in Australia, on account of the plans now is progress for developing irrigation and settlement schemes in the Murray River Valley, and the consequent importance of finding markets for the produce of the settlements.It is also clear from General Smuts&apos;s speeches since his return to. South Africa that he counts the dried fruits proposals (and indeed all those relating to fruit) as of great value.(iii.) Practically no figs have so far been received from the Empire and only a small quantity of plums. On the other hand, the proportion of Empire raisins has increased considerably in the last few years and was nearly 17 per cent, in 1922-23.(iv.) It is estimated that the repeal of the duties on Empire fruits would cause a loss to the Revenue of about  90,000 a year at the outset. This loss would be considerably increased if Australia^ anticipation of largely increased exports to this country are realised.(v.) As the Empire now supplies only a small proportion of the amount of these fruits consumed here, it is unlikely that the repeal of the duties would have immediately any appreciable effect upon retail prices, but if Empire supplies increase some reduction might take place.(b.) Currants.(i.) The Conference proposal was to increase the present duty of 2s. per cwt. on foreign currants to a figure which would make the preference effective and to grant free admission to Empire currants which at present enjoy a preference of one-sixth on the full duty of 2s. per cwt.(ii.) The remarks in sub-paragraph (a) (ii) as regards the interest of Australia and South Africa in the proposed free admission of Empire dried fruit, apply equally to these proposals. The opinion of the Australian and South African representatives appeared to be that the duty on foreign currants should not be less than 10s. 6^. per cwt. &quot;Increasing the currant duty would involve the termination of an agreement with Greece under Avhich the present duty may not be increased and by virtue of which this country receives certain Tariff concessions. The agreement could be ended by giving three months&apos; notice.(iii.) If the duty were raised to 10s.. Qd. per cwt. the gain to.the Revenue is estimated at  410,000 a year and the repeal of the existing duty on Empire currants would mean a loss of about  10,000 a year.(iv.) As the proportion of Empire currants now consumed in this country is small (6^ per cent, in 1922-23), it is estimated that the price of currants generally would rise by Id. per lb. if the duty on the foreign produce were raised to 10s. Qd. per cwt.(v.) Whether or not it is decided to terminate the Greek agreement and tc increase the duty on foreign currants, the duty on Empire currants will presumably be dealt with in the same way as that on other Empire dried fruits.(c.) Non-dutiable Dried Fruits.(i.) At present there is no duty on any dried fruit other than those mentioned above. The Conference proposal was to impose a duty of. 10s. M. per cwt. on foreign apples, pears, peaches, nectarines and pineapples, but to continue to admit such Empire dried fruit duty-free.   Australia and South Africa are the Dominions
mainly concerned and pineapples are of interest to the &quot;West Indies and Straits Settlements. -.&quot;. &apos; . -,,(ii.) If all foreign dried fruit mentioned were taxed, the duty might be expected to produce at the outset about  15,000 a year.(d.) Other Preserved Fruit.Figs, raisins and plums (except apricots. which are specially exempted) if preserved in sugar or water are now liable under the dried fruit duty. &apos; Other preserved fruit pays no duty save in respect of sugar contents, if any. The Conference proposal was to impose an all-round duty of 5s. a cwt. on the principal forms of foreign preserved fruit not at present dutiable, this duty to be in addition to the duty on the sugar contents, if any. The 5s. duty would be remitted in the case of Empire fruit and fruit pulp would also be exempted. The preserved fruits to be included in this new duty were to be apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, apricots and pineapples. Australia is known to be greatly interested in this proposal from the point of view of the Murray River Valley scheme. It is estimated that the duty would produce at the outset about  240,000 a year.(e.) Sugar.(i.) Empire sugar at present enjoys a preference of one-sixth, or 4s. 3^. per cwt. being nearly \d. a lb. on refined sugar. The Conference proposal was to give an undertaking that, if the sugar duty is reduced, the preference shall, for a period of ten years, not fall with it, but be maintained at its present amount of nearly \d. per lb., so long at least as the duty on foreign sugar does not fall below that level. This proposal has become known as &quot;stabilisation.&quot;(ii.) An undertaking was given in 1922 by the then Government that the preference on all goods then entitled to preferential rates of duty on importation into the United Kingdom should be continued for ten years. This undertaking, though of a general character, had particular reference to West Indian sugar. (A copy of the relative Questions and Answers in Parliament will be found in the Appendix to this Memorandum.)(iii.) It is important to note that this undertaking related only to the rate of preference and not to its amount and so far as Parliament was willing to implement the promise it would be debarred from abolishing preference or from reducing the rate of preference, e.g., on sugar, from one-sixth to one-twelfth. But of course the undertaking carried with it no undertaking to keep the amount of preference the same whatever the full rate of the sugar duty might be from time to time.(iv.) Although the Dominions are to a certain small extent interested in this proposal, the bulk of the sugar imported from the Empire comes from the West Indies and Mauritius.Representations have been made for a number of years by the West Indies as to the importance of safeguarding the position of their sugar industry by tariff preference. Their&apos; chief competitor is Cuba, which has great advantages of soil and of large scale production. Moreover, Cuban sugar production is controlled and financed from the United States, and enjoys preference in that country. The growers maintain that stabilisation would facilitate the investment of capital in the sugar-growing colonies. The Colonial Office attach importance to doing what is possible to counteract the growing influence of the United States in the West Indian Colonies which Have before them the benefits which have accrued to Cuba from her connection with that country.It should also be mentioned that the existence of the preference in the United Kingdom, by providing a market alternative to New Zealand, has enabled the sugar producers in Fiji to maintain the industry (which is a staple one) there, in spite of the competition with Java.(v.) The present proposal for stabilisation would not have any measurable effect on the Revenue unless and until the duty is altered. If the duty were reduced by Id. per lb. (9s. M. per cwt.) stabilisation would increase the cost of reduction by about  700,000 a year. This is the more serious, seeing that the cost of reducing the sugar duty by Id. per lb. without stabilisation would be over  11^ millions a year.(vi.) Under present market conditions the Colonial producer is able to add to the world price of sugar practically the whole of the preferential rebate in his sales to the British refiner. Thus, it is true to say that at the present time the sugar refining industry in this country benefits little, if at all, from preference. On the other hand, it is sometimes argued that, in the interests of British sugar refiners, [11305] &quot; .  B 2
Colonial production should be fostered in order to prevent sugar supplies being entirely controlled by Cuba and Java. But this danger would, in any case, be mitigated if and when Europe has an exportable surplus.(vii.) It will be seen from the foregoing paragraph that none of the preference now granted on sugar reaches the consumer in this country, and there is no likelihood that any part of the further  700,000 a year, which, in the event of the reduction of the duty by Id. per lb., the Imperial Exchequer would be asked to sacrifice under the Conference proposal, would go in reduction of retail prices in this country.(f.) Tobacco.   ..(i.) The proposal is to increase the preference on tobacco from one-sixth to one-fourth. The present full rate of duty on unmanufactured tobacco is 8s. 2d. per lb., and the effect of the proposal would, therefore, be to increase the amount of preference from about 1$. id. to 2s. per lb.(ii.) The Dominions, India and the Colonies and Protectorates are all interested in this proposal. Although the Union of South Africa sends very little tobacco to this country, it is understood that importance is attached to the proposal by the Union Government from a political point of view, the idea being that it could be represented as of special advantage to the small Boer farmers. Nyasaland and British India are the two principal sources of supply of Empire tobacco, and there is little doubt that the production for export in those countries would be stimulated by the increased preference. India does not give, and Nyasaland is precluded by international convention from giving, any tariff preference to British goods.(iii.) The existing amount of preference, which is high in relation to the value of the tobacco, is thought to be sufficient to ensure a place in this market for any Empire tobacco that could in any way hope to compete in quality with the foreign product. The Colonial industries are new, and manufacturers in this country are known to feel that the growers should concentrate upon quality rather than upon quantity, and they fear that the effect of an increased preference would be to encourage expansion of production rather than improvement in quality.(iv.) It is estimated that the proposal would cost the Revenue  450,000 a year, allowing for some increase in Empire importations. Judging by present experience, increased preference would be shared between the growers, the trade interests in this country and the consumer.(g.) Wine.(i.) The proposals regarding wine were not a part of the original scheme for increasing preferences laid before the Economic Conference by the late Government, but were put forward by the latter following representations made at the Conference by the representatives of Australia and South Africa. These Dominions attach considerable importance to the fostering of the wine industry from the point of view of fruit growing. It was. urged that the existing preferences, although relatively substantial had been found insufficient to enable the Dominion wine growers to obtain a footing in this market, especially in the case of the heavier wines competing with the wines of Spain and Portugal.(ii.) The late Government refused to consider any extension of the existing preference,on the lighter wines, as the Dominions have already a good market in this country, but proposed to double the existing preference of 2s. per gallon on the heavier wines, which, when of foreign origin, pay at the rate of 6s. per gallon. It was also proposed to increase from 30 per cent, to 50 per cent, the preference on the surtax of 12s. 6^. per gallon on sparkling wine. The imports from the Empire of heavier wines and of sparkling wines have hitherto been very small, and, if the proposals were adopted, the immediate effect would, it is thought, be so small as to render it unnecessary to make any allowance for loss of Revenue in the estimates for the coming year. The proposal in regard to heavier wines of Empire origin would, however, afford them a very big margin of duty over foreign wines of the same kind, and it may well be that in the future increased importations of Empire wines would seriously endanger the wine Revenue.(h.) New Duties on Raw Apples, Canned Salmon, Lobster, Crayfish, and Crabs, Honey, Lim,e and Lemon Juices.(i.) The Conference proposals involve the imposition of new duties in order to give preference, and in all cases the articles proposed to be taxed are articles of consumption. These proposals did not form part of the original scheme laid before the Economic Conference by the late Government.
&apos;.&apos; (ii.) The most important of these proposals is the one relating to apples. Canada is the Dominion primarily interested, and she hoped, with the aid of the duty, to displace United States apples in this country. The duty is estimated to wield in the first instance  400,000 a year. ^  &apos;(iii.) Canada and Newfoundland are specially interested in canned salmon and canned lobster. South Africa has a crayfish industry. It was proposed to tax canned -crabs, of which&quot; only a small quantity comes from the Empire, as it is difficult to distinguish between them and lobsters. The duty on canned fish might yield about  200,000 a year.(iv.) Most of the Dominions and the West Indies are interested in the proposed tax on honey, and lime juice particularly concerns Dominica. The duty on honey would yield &quot;about  12,000 a year and that on lime and lemon juices about  3,000 a year.(D.) Summary of Effect upon Revenue.The estimated effect on the Revenue, in the first full year, of the proposals put forward by the late Government at the Economic Conference may be stated as &quot;follows: Gain.Raisins, figs, plumsCurrants Other dried fruits Other preserved fruits Tobacco WineRaw apples Canned fish, &amp;c. Honey Fruit juice410,000 15,000 240,000400,000 200,000 12,000 3,0001,280,000Loss.  90,000 10,000450,000550,000If the sugar duty were reduced by Id. per lb. (9s. id. per cwt.) the additional loss of Revenue is estimated at  700,000, if the amount of preference remained at the -existing figure of nearly \d. per lb.2. Shipping Taxation (4 C I c).The second recommendation under this head provides for the extension to the Dominions of the provisions in the Finance Act, 1923, for the avoidance of double Income Tax on shipping profits as between the United Kingdom and foreign States. This recommendation could most conveniently be given effect to by a clause in the Finance Bill, 1924. It was designed to meet the case of Canada, which does not levy income tax on the profits of non-resident shipowners.3. Immunity of State Enterprises (4 K I).The first part of this Resolution, following the recommendations of the Colwyn Committee, records the agreement of the Conference (without prejudice to the rights of the States or Provinces of a self-governing, Dominion) that &quot; each of the&apos; several Parliaments of Great Britain, the Dominions and India shall be invited to enact at the earliest opportunity a declaration that the general and particular provisions of its Acts or Ordinances imposing taxation shall be deemed to apply to any commercial or industrial enterprise carried on by or on behalf of any other such Governments in the same manner in all respects as if it were carried on by or on behalf of a subject of the British Crown.&quot; It is not contemplated in the Resolution that such legislation should have retrospective effect for any year prior to 1924.The Resolution further records the agreement of the Conference that negotiations should be opened with foreign countries as soon as possible after this legislation shall have been passed, with a view to reciprocal agreement between them and the Empire along similar lines.As concerns British taxation, the appropriate form of legislation would be a Section in the Finance Act, 1924, declaring, in effect, that, as from the year 1924-25,
Dominion Governments, in so far as they trade in this country, shall be deemed to? be subject to taxation in accordance with the ordinary provisions of the law of this country. A complementary declaration will be required to the effect that a. Dominion Government, except so far as it engages in trade, shall be deemed to be exempt from Income Tax and from the comparatively trifling impositions of Inhabited House Duty and Land Tax.A decision is required on this Resolution. If it is adopted I should propose to-communicate the intention to legislate to the Dominion Governments by telegram beforehand.The second part of this Resolution is dealt with in Section (C) 17 of this: Memorandum.(B.) Those Resolutions which would require other Legislative Provision.1. Co-operation in Financial Assistance to Imperial Development (2). -This Resolution adopts the proposals of the late Government to contribute to-interest charges on loans raised in the Dominions for capital expenditure by public utility undertakings with the object of accelerating enterprises which would not otherwise be immediately undertaken. A clause making the required provision is included in the Trade Facilities Bill now before the House of Commons. Preliminary discussion took place on the financial resolution introduced on the 19th February in connection with the Bill, and agreed to on the 20th February. The Dominion Governments have been informed by telegram that His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the proposals in principle, and are initiating legislation accordingly.2. Carriage of Goods by Sea (4 C I b).The Resolution recommends the adoption of the rules embodied in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill, which was before the last Parliament. The President of the Board of Trade announced in the House of Commons on the 12th February that it was proposed to reintroduce the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill, and to proceed with it as rapidly as the other business of Parliament permits. I am proposing to explain, the situation to the Dominion Governments by despatch.3. Co-operation for Technical Research and Information (4 J (i) and (ii)).A Bill has been prepared to give effect to the recommendations of the Conference-regarding the reorganisation of the Imperial Institute, and the incorporation with it of the Mineral Resources Bureau, and this Bill, modified so as to enable the Exhibition Galleries of the Institute to be retained for the present, will shortly be circulated to the Cabinet. The question of the retention of the Galleries, which was not recommended by the Conference, has had to be reconsidered in the light of subsequent events. The Bill originally prepared by the late Government (which omitted any provision for retention of the galleries) was communicated to the Dominion Governments at the time.4. Imperial Policy with regard to the Import and Export of Live Stock (5)..Legislation would be required to give effect to the recommendations of the Economic Conference for the promotion of inter-imperial trade in pedigree stock. A Bill is being prepared in the Ministry of Agriculture, and will be circulated to^ the Cabinet in due course.(C.) Those Resolutions which would only require Administrative Action. 1. Oversea Settlement (1).This Resolution approves the report of the Committee appointed to consider Oversea Settlement.Since the Conference terminated satisfactorily agreements have been made with Canada and Australia in respect of passages for families, juveniles and women. Nothing is asked of His Ma.jesty&apos;s Government beyond what had already been agreed upon. Hence no new decision is palled lor by the Resolution. Administrative action will proceed on the part of the Oversea. Settlement Committee.
2. Imperial Preference in Public Contracts (3 2).This Resolution reaffirms the principle that, in all Government contracts, -effective preference should be given to goods made and materials produced within the Empire, and also suggests that State, provincial and local Government authorities should be encouraged to take note of it. So far as Government contracts in this country are concerned, this Resolution only reaffirms a principle to which effect has already been given for many years by administrative action. I am taking up the suggestion in the latter part of the Resolution with the competent authorities.3. Commercial, Diplomatic and Consular Services (4 A I).&quot;1 Under this Resolution the late Government undertook to place at the disposal of Dominion and Colonial Governments and the Government of India the services of Commercial Diplomatic Officers (or of Senior Consular Officers where no Commercial Diplomatic Officers have been appointed) in the same way and to the same extent as the services of Trade Commissioners within the Empire.The necessary instructions have already been issued to all Diplomatic Missions and the position is about to be explained to the Dominion Governments by despatch.4. Commercial Travellers&apos; Samples (4 A 2).This Resolution proposes that articles imported as samples by Commercial Travellers belonging to the British Empire shall be admitted throughout the Empire free of duties, subject to certain safeguards. This proposal has been in force in this country for many years in regard to those Dominions which have granted reciprocal treatment. There will be no difficulty in arranging for its extension by the Board of Customs to other parts of the Empire, as and when the latter agree to put the recommendation into operation.5. Statistics (4 B).The Board of Trade are re-examining the Imperial Statistics published by them with a view to submitting a revised scheme to the Dominion and other Governments, which is the course recommended by the Conference. The Dominion Governments have been informed accordingly.6. Imperial Shipping Committee (4 C I a).The Conference warmly commended the work of the Committee and recommended its continuance. The only action necessary will be to inform the Dominion Govern-ments that His Majesty&apos;s Government endorse the Resolution. In the meantime the Committee is continuing its work.7. Shipping Taxation (4 C I c).As regards Dominions which impose Income Tax on the profits of non-resident shipowners, the Conference recommended certain alterations of Dominion Law and certain improvements of administrative machinery here to facilitate relief from double Income Tax. I understand that the Board of Inland Revenue anticipate no difficulty in taking the action required here.8. Air Communications (4 C 2).The Resolutions recommend the circulation of information throughout the Empireand reciprocal consultation on questions of air development. A scheme is now being drawn up in the Air Ministry for promoting rapid interchange of information. ^ Special reference is made in the Resolutions to informing the Dominions of progress with the Burney airship scheme. This matter has now been referred to^ a Cabinet Committee under my chairmanship for consideration, and I propose to inform the Dominion Governments of the appointment of&apos; this Committee and its terms of reference.
9. Cables and Wireless (4 C 3 a).This Resolution emphasises the importance of developing an efficient Imperial&apos; &quot;wireless service. This question was referred, with Cabinet authority, to a. Committee appointed by the Postmaster-General, which has now reported. I telegraphed a summary of its recommendations, to the Governments of Canada,, the Commonwealth, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa on the 26th February, saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to know their views&apos;, on the recommendations by telegraph at the earliest possible moment.10. Imperial Communications Committee (4 C 3 b).This Resolution recommends that representatives of the Dominions and India should be associated in the work of the Committee when questions of interest to them are under consideration. Limited action has already been taken in accordance with this Resolution, but I think it would be well that it should be formally endorsed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.11. Atlantic Cable (4 C 3 c).This Resolution recommends that Empire Governments should, where possible,, use the State-owned Atlantic cable route. There are at present two cables which are being operated by the General Post Office, and already used for British Government traffic.   Hence no special action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government is needed.12. Preference to British Companies (4 C 3 d).I suggest that the Postmaster-General might intimate on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that when any question of cable or wireless concessions to private enter-prise comes up they will give careful attention to the recommendation of the Conference that preference should be accorded to British companies of any part of the Empire.13. Patents (4 E).The Resolution recommends that the Colonies and Protectorates should be invited&apos; to adopt a scheme whereby a patent granted in the United Kingdom should extend to&apos; Colonies and Protectorates on registration there. I am. sending this invitation,.after consultation with the Board of Trade.14. Economic Defence (4 F).This Resolution announces that the Governments represented at the Conference have no intention of departing from their policy of non-flag-discrimination as regards countries which give national treatment to British shipping, and states that they will consult together in the event of danger arising to the Overseas shipping of the Empire through an attempt by a foreign country to discriminate against the British flag.I am consulting the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Board of Trade on the question whether it is desirable to invite the Dominion Governments, formally to accept&apos;this Resolution.15. International Conference on Customs Formalities (4 G 2).This Resolution recommends for favourable consideration the conclusions of the-recent League of Nations International Conference on Customs and other similar formalities.No legislation is necessary in this country, and the necessary steps are being taken by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in consultation with the Board of Trade and other Departments with a view to ratification of the Convention drawn up at the Conference. The Dominion Governments are being consulted as to-ratification on their behalf.16. Co-operation in Technical Research (4 J 3).This Resolution recommends increased co-operation in research between various, parts of the Empire. I understand that the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research welcomes this Resolution and is ready to act on it.
17. Immunity of State Enterprises (4 K 2).The first Resolution, which relates to immunity from taxation of all State-owned enterprises, has already&apos; been dealt with (see section (A) 3 of this Memorandum). The second Resolution recommends the adoption of draft clauses on the immunity of State-owned ships as the basis on which an international convention might be concluded. I understand that the Admiralty and the Board of Trade accept this recommendation and think that it might be approved.18. Forestry (6).This Resolution affirms the acceptance in principle of the Resolutions of the Forestry Conference (Canada), 1923, and recommends them for favourable consideration to the Governments of the Empire.I suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government might announce that they will be glad to consider, in consultation with the other Governments wherever necessary, what can be done. The Colonial Office and the Forestry Commission are in consultation on the detailed recommendations.19. Imperial Economic Committee (8).His Majesty&apos;s Government have already decided, particularly in view of the fact that the Economic Conference itself did not reach unanimity on the subject, that they cannot support the adoption of this Resolution. The Dominion Govern-ments were so informed by telegram on the 20th February, in advance of the announcement to this effect which was made in the House of Commons^by me on the 25th February.(D.) Those Resolutions on which no Action is required at present.1. Trade Catalogues (4 A 3). .  this  Resolution recommends the free admission of Trade Catalogues under certain limitations. Such catalogues are already admitted free of duty into this country, so no action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government is involved.2. Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments (4 D).This Resolution recommends a universal arrangement throughout the Empire for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments, including Arbitration Awards.Legislation has already been enacted in this country providing for such reciprocal arrangements and it only remains for the Oversea parts of the Empire, which have not already done so, to fall into line.3. Valuation of Goods for Customs Duty Purposes (4 G I).These Resolutions recommend the adoption of uniform invoices and certificates in those parts of the Empire which have not yet adopted them. This Resolution is addressed only to the Oversea parts of the Empire, and calls for no action on the part of this country.4. Empire Currency and Exchange (4 H).These Resolutions reject proposals for the introduction of Empire Currency Bills and make suggestions for remedying difficulties that have arisen in regard to exchange in certain parts of the Empire.No action is called for on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. Workmen&apos;s Compensation (7). Resolution I: Non-resident Workmen.This Resolution recommends that certain restrictions on the rights of British subjects under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Laws of certain parts of the Empire on grounds of non-residence in the State in which the accident happened shall be removed.. The Resolution deals only with cases of permanent disablement and deatn and no action is involved so far as this&apos; country is concerned. Our Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act provides for the payment of compensation to  permanently[11305]    &quot; &apos;   &apos; &apos;      c
disabled workmen going to reside abroad, and imposes no restriction as regards residence in the case of dependents.Resolution II: Seamen.This Resolution recommends that the restrictions in the laws of certain parts of the Empire on the right of seamen to recover compensation for accidents occurring outside Territorial Waters should be removed.This also involves no action on the part of Great Britain, as under the British Act compensation is payable for injuries for accidents on a British ship, as defined in the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1906, wherever the ship may be at the time of the accident.Resolution III: A liens.This Resolution invites each Government of the Empire to consider, having regard to its own particular conditions, the possibility of adopting the principle of reciprocity in Workmen&apos;s Compensation Legislation with a view to the removal of disabilities imposed by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Laws of certain Foreign Countries on British subjects.A proposal for an International Convention providing for reciprocity in Workmen&apos;s Compensation is one of the subjects on the Agenda for the next Inter-national Labour Conference to be held at Geneva in June next, and it is suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should postpone further consideration of this Resolution until after that Conference.It may be noted that an Anglo-French Convention for reciprocity in Workmen&apos;s Compensation was concluded in 1909, that negotiations are proceeding with several Foreign Governments for similar bilateral Conventions, and that by Section 26 of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1923, special powers are given to enable the Government to give effect to such Conventions by Order-in-Council.J. H. T.Colonial Office, February 29, 1924.APPENDIX.Imperial Preference (West Indies). Parliamentary Questions and Answers: February 23, 1922.(O.R, Vol. 150, Cols. 2150/1.)Sir S. Hoare asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether his attention has&apos;been drawn to the statement that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State * for the Colonies announced at a meeting of the Associated West Indian Chambers of Commerce in Trinidad, on the 29tb January, that the British Government had decided to make a trade arrangement with the West Indies, guaranteeing the continuance for the next 10 years of the existing rate of preference; and whether he has any announcement to make on this subject ?Mr. Churchill : I have seen the report of the announcement by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, which represents, in substance, the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose for the acceptance of Parliament, namely, an undertaking to the West Indian Colonies that the preference on goods at present entitled to preferential rates on importation into the United Kingdom shall be continued for 10 years. The undertaking would be that the Customs Duties on,such goods other than spirits shall bear to the duties oh similar goods imported from foreign countries the proportions prescribed by the Second Schedule of-the Finance Act, 1919, and that the Customs Duties on spirits shall be lower, by not less than 2s. m. per proof gallon, than the duties on foreign spirits of a like kind.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider that it will be necessary to make any formal agreement with the West Indies. They assume that the West Indian Colonies will continue to accord preference to goods of the Mother Country through-out the period.&apos; The proposal for anundertaking to the West Indian Colonies is due
9 7:&apos;- - . w r-:11to the representations made to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the introduction of further capital is necessary to maintain and develop the main industries in the West Indies, and that the raising of this capital will be greatly^ facilitated if the producers can be guaranteed that the preference which they enjoy in the United Kingdom market will be assured to them over a definite term of years.Although the hon. Member&apos;s question relates solely to the West Indies, and has been answered accordingly, I ought to make it clear that there is no intention of o-iving less favourable treatment to goods imported into the United Kingdom from any other part of the Empire during the 10 years in question.Imperial Preference (West Indies) : May 22, 1922.(O.R., Vol. 154, Cols. 803/4.)28. Lieutenant-Colonel James asked the Prime Minister whether, seeing that, on the 29th January of this year, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies announced in Trinidad that the British Government had decided to make a trade agreement with the British West Indies, guaranteeing to them the existing rate of preference in the Customs Duties of the United Kingdom for 10 years, he will say what steps His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to take to redeem that pledge?110. Captain Wedgwood Benn asked the.Chancellor of the Exchequer whether any pledge has been given by the Government that the preferential duty on sugar will be continued for 10 years; and, if so, by what authority such a pledge has been given ?The Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Edward Wood): I have been asked to take this question, and, with the permission of the lion, and gallant Member for Leith, I will answer it and 110 together. I was authorised to announce in the West Indies that His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose to Parliament the continuance of preference on existing lines to articles at present enjoying it for a period of 10 years. It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to maintain this undertaking in any relevant financial legislation which it may be their duty to submit to Parliament, as long as they continue to enjoy His Majesty&apos;s confidence; and, as my right hon. friend stated in reply to the hon. Member for Chelsea, on the 23rd February, this legislation is, and must be, subject to Parliament&apos;s approval.Captain Benn : May I ask the Leader of the House whether this House was consulted before the Under-Secretary was authorised to give a pledge with the Colonies that preference would be continued for 10,years?Mr. Chamberlain : I must ask for notice of the question. I was discussing with my right hon. friend beside me the matter of the business of the House, and I do not know what is the subject matter of the question.Major M. Wood : Did the Secretary of State for the Colonies know anything about this? . . j     oMr. Churchill : Yes, Sir, I most gladly co-operated in bringing it to pass.Captain Benn : Does the Secretary of State for the Colonies think that he is qualified to give pledges for future fiscal arrangements, without consulting the House of Commons ?Mr. Churchill : This is a matter which was discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I have no doubt that my right hon. friend will be quite ready to defend his action, and I shall be quite ready to do so, too.Lieutenant-Colonel James: May I ask the Secretary for the Colonies to consider the advisability of giving an undertaking that the substantial value of the preference shall not be less than that enjoyed at present ?Imperial Preference (Jamaica) : May 23, 1922.&quot;   .(O.R., Vol. 154, Col. 991.)n. 2  HuRI) asked the Secretai7 of State for the Colonies whether he is aware that the Government of Jamaica has published in the West Indian and Canadian
press, for general information, his despatch of the 9th March on the proposal to continue for 10 years the preference on goods at present entitled to preferential rates on importation into Great Britain; and whether the despatch will be laid before this Parliament forthwith, together with any replies that may have been received from Colonial Governors?Mr. Churchill : The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The despatch in Question was sent to the Colonial Governments with a view to publication, and it will be laid before the House as early as possible. A notification has been received from the Governments of Jamaica and Barbados that publication has taken place, but no other replies have yet been received.Lieutenant-Commander Kenworthy : Is it proposed to consult the House of Commons before committing future Governments a change is expected to a fiscal policy for 10 years ?Mr. Churchill : I certainly hold that the Government has not gone beyond what is usual in matters of this kind. It is desirable that the Colonies should have some assurance of a continuance of conditions.Lieutenant-Commander Kenworthy ; Does the right hon. gentleman think it is quite fair, because, for the moment, there is a tremendous Protectionist majority in the House, that they should bind future Governments for 10 years?Mr. Churchill : The hon. and gallant gentleman, who is to form a part of the Government of the future, will be perfectly free, of course, in this, as in other matters, to Dreak faith with the Colonies.
