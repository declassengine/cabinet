[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET,CP. 145 (2.4).CABINET.ELIGIBILITY OF IMPERIAL EMPLOYEES IN MALTA AS ;   CANDIDATES FOR THE MALTA LEGISLATURE.b Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I SHOULD like to take the decision of the Cabinet on the following,question which has come up with regard to the eligibility of the Imperial employees in Malta to stand as candidates for the Malta Legislature.  .At the time of the establishment of responsible Government in Malta in 1921, the question was raised whether employees of the Imperial Government in the island could be allowed to stand as candidates for election to the Malta Parliament without being compelled to resign their employment in order to do so. The people chiefly concerned were the workers in the Malta Dockyard.The Governor (Lord Plumer) and the Admiral Superintendent of the Dockyard were strongly in favour of the&apos; employees being permitted to do this. The reason for their attitude is best summed up in the words of the Admiral: &quot; They [the employees] are loyal, progressive and form, perhaps, the most hopeful element in an electorate which has not yet found its bearings.&quot;The Colonial Office and Admiralty made joint representations to the Treasury in order to secure this privilege for the dockyard employees. The Treasury, however, at that time were very averse from granting any concession which might weaken the. maintenance of the &quot; very important rule &quot; by which the employment of Civil Servants in this country is terminated on their becoming Parliamentary candidates, and ruled that dockyard employees could not become candidates for the Malta Legislature without resigning their appointments. Lord Plumer was accordingly informed in October 1921 by the then Secretary of State for the Colonies to the effect that this ruling must be accepted.There the matter rested until a few weeks ago, when the Governor drew attention to a decision taken by the Treasury, just before the resignation of the late Government, in the case of Mr. Moses, a shipwright at the Devonport Dockyard, who at the recent General Election resigned his appointment to stand as a Parliamentary candidate, and, being unsuccessful in his candidature, was reinstated in the service with full pension rights. Lord Plumer observed that this decision would appear to be applicable logically to Imperial employees who became candidates for election to the local Parliament. The comments of the Treasury were invited on this, and they have now informed the Colonial Office that &quot; The decision was taken on the individual merits of the particular case and is without prejudice to the general question of the Parliamentary candidature of State Servants.&quot;Lord Plumer has, I feel, made a good point in bringing up the Moses case a point which, on the face of it, seems to be hardly satisfactorily met by the Treasury * statement that the decision was taken without prejudice to the general principle. Moreover, on looking into the question as it affects Malta, I have formed the opinion that there is good ground for reviewing the general ruling which has been given prohibiting these employees from standing for the Malta Parliament without resigning their employment. These men form, as the Admiralhas pointed out, an excellent element in the population from which to draw members of the Legislature.   I feel that if they were allowed to stand without resigning their[11309]
employment the change involved could scarcely be regarded as affecting in any real sense the rule under which Civil Servants in this country are called upon to resign their appointment on becoming candidates for election to the Imperial Parliament and this is a rule which I do not in any way wish to call in question in this connection since that rule rests on the consideration that it would be objectionable to allow Civil Servants to become members of the body which determines their conditions of service. To allow Imperial employees in Malta to become members of the local Legislature is, however, quite a different matter, as that body not only has no control over their conditions of service, but, generally speaking, has no powers at all with regard to matters of Imperial concern.I need hardly trouble the Cabinet with details regarding the conditions upon which the employees who became candidates would be granted leave during their election campaign and, if elected, temporarily seconded during their membership of the Legislature. I should, however, be glad to know whether my colleagues are prepared to approve the principle that employees in the pay of the Imperial Government in Malta who are serving under ordinary civil conditions may in future be allowed to stand for the local Parliament without being called upon to resign their employment in order to do so.J. H. T.Colonial Office, February29, 1924,
