I 5?secret. 152(54). j Jf^J-VPAI !3S?1NE.PROPOSED,-SPECIAL LEGISLATION f CR TRIBAL AREAS. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Oolonios,Now that the main question of policy in Palestine is settled, I invite my colleagues to consider the point raised In paragraph 14 of the Departmental Memorandum circulated with my Memorandum of the 19th February, 1924, CP, 121 (24).As there indicated, the High Commissioner found it necessary in November last to ask for increased powers to deal with the state of insecurity in the outlying areas of Palestine where tribal and Beduin elements preponderate     SirHr Samuel1 s proposals would enable district Governors to enforce the principle of collective responsibility upon tribal sections and villages in tribal areas, and, where necessary, to impose collective punishment (whether by fine or otherwise) for the misdemeanours of individuals.These proposals have nothing to do with the Zionist controversy.     They are framed in the interests of public order, the&apos; proper maintenance of which concerns all law-abiding persons in Palestine-, of whatever denomination.     I realise of course the general objections to placing in the hands of the executive what are properly judicial functions; but I am satisfied that, in the peculiar circumstances of the case, the measures proposed by the Palestine Government are right and necessary.&quot;She need for suoh legislation was recognised in principle by my predecessor, and it was in compliance with his instructions that the specific proposals, now under consideration, were submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government,     These proposals were still under examination at the Colonial Office when the late Government resigned.-Z7
O p aI append the High Commissioner1s despatch giving cover to the draft Ordinance which it is proposed to enact.     Sir H.&quot; Samuel has since telegraphed to me (February 27th.) pressing for early orders.     The risk of a renewal of raiding at the close of the winter months makes it desirable to arm the local authorities with the necessary powers as soon as possible? It will be seen that the new enactment will be in operation for one year only in the first instance.I propose, if my colleagues agree,  (l) to approve the draft ordinance subject to certain verbal amendments;   and (2) to invite Sir H, Samuel to review the whole question again during the coming year with a view to submitting, at its close, such further recommendations as he may think desirable.(Intd.)

TO CP. 152 (24). ^30th, E ov emb er , 19 23 his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, ICG,, &amp;c, &amp;o,,&amp;&apos;o., His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies,My Lord iiiike,I have the honour to refer to Your Grace&apos;s despatch Confidential of 8th October, 1923, concerning public security in the Southern District of Palestine, and to submit for Your Grace&apos;s consideration an Ordinance which I have caused to be drafted in accordance with Your Grace13 directions,2.   After careful reflection I have provided that the special powers conferred on District. Governors shall be applicable to Tribal ,;reas as well in the other districts, as in the Southern District, with reference to which the memorandum considered by Your Grace was particularly concerned,.  The same powers are appropriate for dealing with Bedouins in other parts of Palestine because their tribesi throughout the country recognise a collective responsibility.   Moreover I have proposed, that certain sections may be applie;- by special order to villages as well as tribal areas.   There are occasional outbreaks of turbulent and lawless conduct among the settled population, particularly in the southern and central hill-country, which call for severer administrative action than is provided by the normal law:    and the exceptional power of enforcing collective responsibility on a village for aiding the police tc track offenders will, I think, have salutary consequences,3.     The powers prescribed in sections 2 and 3 are modelled on provisions in legislation issued in &apos;Iraq since,the British/
O p othe British Occupation for dealing with tribes.   The object of section 4 is to make effective the imposition of a punitive police post on a lawless tribe.    The object of section 5 is to prevent the initiation of blood feuds, the fear of which, deters the police in many cases from dealing rigorously with offenders in tribal areas,4.     It will be noted that no appeal has been provided from the order of a Mstrict   Governor; but he can impose a fine under section 2 only after reference to me.      L!he action contemplated under this and the other sections appears to be administrative rather than judicial, and, therefore, an appeal to any Court would not be appropriate.   or has it been found necessary to repeal any part of the ordinary Ottoman Law: the powers conferred are rather supplementary to than in derogation of anything in the Ottoman Codes or the enactments of the -administration concerning prevention of Crime.5,     ijastly it will be seal that the Ordinance is designe   in the first place to remain in force for one year only.I have, e tc.HEBLEET SAMUELaHIGH C JvIIvIISdlOHBR.
DRAFT ORDINANCE FOR THE BETTER PREVENTION OF CRIME IN TRIBAL AREAS0lo   This Ordnance extends to Tribal Areas in any District of Palestine,     Where any village area    has boon found to be in a disturbed&apos;or lawless state, the provisions of sections 2, 6 and 7 of the Ordinance may be applied by ordo-&quot; of the High Commissioner to such area ,20   Where there appears to be good reason to believe that the inhabitants of any Bedu aroa or encampment have(a) connived at or in any way abetted the commission of an offencej   or(b) failed to render all assistance in their power to discover the offenders or to effect their arrestj(c) connived at the escape of or harboured any offender-or person suspected of having taken part in the commission of an offence;   or(d) combined to suppress material evidence of the commission of an offence,the District Governor may, with the sanction of the High Commissioner, by Order in writing direct that a fine be levied collectively from the inhabitants of such area or encampment *     This fine may include compensation to the victim of the offence for the injury caused or for loss of property,,Tho fine shall be recovered in such, proportions and in such manner as may be stated in the Order, and in default of payment shall be recoverable as arreas of taxes,/3.
5.   The&apos;Sheikh of a tribe or sub-tribe shall(a) Report to the District Governor any crime which occurs in the area of his tribe or sub-tribe as soon as may be after it has come to his knowledge;(b) When required by the District Governor, arrest any criminal in the area of his tribe or sub-tribe;(c) when  required by the District Governor, produce any person belonging to his tribe or sub-tribe who is charged with an offence;(d) Execute any order enforcing a fine made under the preceding ArticlejIn default he shall be liable to be placed under police supervision in accordance with the powers conferred by the Prevention of Crimes (Additional Powers) Ordinance, 1921.4.    Where the area of a tribe or sub-tribe has been declared to be in a disturbed or dangerous state under section 14 of the Police Ordinance, 1921, and an additional police force has been imposed upon the area, it shall be lawful for any Police Officer on the order of the District Governor to prevent the removal of the tribe or sub-tribe from the area by the arrest of the animals of the tribe or sub-tribe.5.    Where a blood feud or other cause of quarrel likely to lead to bloodshed exists between two families or factions, the District Governor may, after enquiry, order all or any of the members of both families or factions, or %f either family or faction, to execute a bend under the Prevention of Crimes Ordinance, 192C .

unlawfully taken or attempted, the District Governor may declare the bend of a&apos;1.1 or any of the members of the other family or faction and their sureties, if any, to be forfeited,, unless it is shown to,his satisfaction that the homicide or attempt was not committed by or in consequence of the abetment of any member of that family or faction.Where a person has under the provisions of this Article given security or been imprisoned for failure to give security, the District Governor may, on the expiry of the period for which security was required, require him to give security for a further period for the purpose of preventing bloodshed.     The proceeding may be founded on the facts on which the original Order to give security was founded, and it shall not be necessary to prove any fresh facts to justify an Order to give security for a further period, but such an Order shall have the same effect and. be enforced in the same manner as the original Order,     Provided that no person shall suffer for failure to give security under this Article continuous imprisonment for mere thanone year.6.
