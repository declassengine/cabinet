The Institute will come to an end for want of funds unless these contributions are obtained soon. *5.     The Bill stands exactly as it was drafted by the late Government save for the changes I have made to enable the Exhibition Galleries to be retained.   The Conference acquiesced in their abandonment for finanoial reasons.The Conference unanimously recommended that theinstitution.Legislation is necessary both because the oom--1-
But the Dominion Governments have sinoe changed their attitude a &quot; &apos;and the majority, including Canada and Australia, desire theGalleries to he kept.6.     The situation has further been altered by the promise of lora Cowdray to find the sum of  5,000 a yoar for-five yearstowards the up-keep of the Galleries.7.     I am satisfied that in the present Parliamentary con-ditions it would be impossible to pass the Bill unless provision&apos; were made for the retention of the Galleries.     It may be possible, later on, to let   off space, if not required by India or the Dominions, but it is not desirable that the -Exhibition Galleries should be used to house any part of the Imperial War Museum. Personally, I could not support such a proposal.8.     The Treasury are prepared to sanction an additional contribution towards the upkeep of the Galleries over and above their fixed contribution cf  9,000 a year promised at the Beonomio Conference,, but only on the oend ition,that about 25,000 cubic feet of space in the Exhibition Galleries Is made available at once, or in the near future,, for such part of the tfar Museum, as oannot be accommodated in the Science Galleries adjoining the Imperial Institute building.   The Treasury regard this part of the scheme as an essential condition of their making provision for the Exhi-prohibition Galleries at the Institute, and are of the opinion that if the Colonial Offioa cannot accept It, the matter should bo referred to the Cabinet for a deoision.   The   Treasury have also stipulated that, in the event of their agreeing to make the additional con-tribution required, this contribution should be dependent on the cost of maintenance of the Galleries and on.the contributions from the Dominions for. the same purpose.    I fully agree with these two stipulations, although I cannot accept the condition as to the &quot;tfar Museum.      , . ^ -9.     I attach a copy of a memorandum containing full particu-lars of the origin of the Bill and subsequent developments.(Intd.)   J.H.T.Oloniai Office18th Maroh, 1924.
Uoaorandum on the Beorganisation of the Imperial Institute.1.    In February 19S3, my predecessor appointed aCommittee of Enquiry under the Chairmanship of the Eon,W.C.A. Ormsby-Gore, M.P. then Under Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, with the following terms of reference&quot;In view of the withdrawal of oversea contributions,and the consequent financial difficulties of the imperial institute, to consider and report(i)  -What funotions at present carried on bythe Institute are considered essential, and(li)   Whether these should be oontinued by the Institute or attached elsewhere, and in this oonnection to take into account the functions of other research organisations and to report what consequential legislative of other measures will be necessary to carry their uecommendations into effect.Further to report on the functions of the imperial institute and to what extent the intention of the Foundersand the Hoy^l Charter are being parried out;   and to suggest any improvements which they consider financially possible,If they recommend that the Institute shall be carried on onits existing basis.&quot;2.    After a prolonged and exhaustive enquiry thisCommittee recommended extensive changes in the management and organisation &amp;f the Imperial Institute and the ImperialMineral Besources Bureau.   Their report, (Gmd. 1997),was laid before Parliament in November cf last year.The main recommendations&quot;and conclusions are summarized inparagraph 116 of the Ueport, but it will be convenient t*reoapitulatp in this memorandum the most important of the... . &apos; Mi
 18t* a- wrecommendations for the future of the Institute and the Bureau.3.    The Committee reoommended that:-(1)   The Imperial Institute should in futurs confine Its activities to those of a Clearing House of intelligence and Information equipped with Laboratories to enable it to carry on only the work of preliminary analysis and investigation of raw materials.   Ill enquiries entailing elaborate investigation or real scientific research should be referred to the competent authorities.   Heliable up-to-date sample rooms. Illustrative of important Empire raw materials, should be maintained.(2)   The Institute should discontinue the attempt to illustrate by means oi Exhibition Galleries the natural resources of the Empire, and the existing collections at South Kensington should be dispersed and the Galleries made available for other purposes.   The Institute should, however^ arrange for a really representa-tive selection of Empire products to be Bade for the purpose of a travelling Exhibition of a purely educational character, and also, if possible^ for organising travelling Exhibitions of the staple products of the Colonies and Protectorates in the appropriate trade centres in this country.(3)   The present Executive Council of the Institute should be abolished, and its place should he taken by a Governing Body containing representatives of Scientific Institutions,, of trade and commerce, and of various Government Departments, as well as representatives
of the Dominion and. Indian government*     This Governing Body should delegate the greater part of its powers and the actual management cf the Institute to a small Managing Committee representing, as far as possible, the various elements of which the larger Governing 3ody is composedo(4) The Director of the reconstituted Institute should be a purely administrative officer and should nc longer be a member of the Governing Body or of the Managing committee (5) The Imperial Institute when so re-organised should bo mads responsible to the Department of Overseas Trade e(6) As soon as these reforms have been carried out, arrangements should be made for the complete amalgamation of the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau with the Imperial Institute.(7) The annual expenditure of the Institute thus re-organised, allowing for the saving due to the elimination of expenditure on the Exhibition Galleries, but including the cost of the work at present done by the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, should not exceed  40.000 per annum, and to meet this expenditure eontri-butions from the Governments of the Empire would be required for a definite period of years.4,   It was apparent that the economies thus effected would enable the re-organised Imperial Institute to carry out the essential features of its work, and at the same time to reduce very considerably the amounts asked by way of contributions from the Oversea Governments.    The foregoing scheme was approved by the late Government and recommended by them for adoption by the Imperial Economic Conference,/asw-    ir*
as will be seen from the inemoradnum which ray predecessor submitted on their behalf to the Conference (printed as v Ho*2. in Girdt 1997) the late Government undertook to propose to Parliament an annual grant of  9,000 for a period of five years, and to invite the Colonies and Protectorates to agree to contribute between them an annual grant of  3,-000 Tor the same period, on condition that the Governments of the Dominions and India were willing to give assurance that they would make contributions amounting in all to  8f000 for the fixed period of five yearso50   The Imperial Economic Conference, after referring the Enquiry Committee.&apos;s Report and the Memorandum mentioned In the preceding paragraph to a special Committee, passed Resolutions recommending the adoption, subject to two slight modifications in regard&quot; to supervision and. management, of the scheme as outlined above for the future of the Imperial Institute and the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, end suggesting that the representatives of the Dominions end India should advise their Legislatures to make certain specific contributions annually to secure the sum of  8,000 for a period of five years,6. Immediately after the Imperial Economic Conference came to an end, the Duke of Devonshire appointed an Interdepartmental Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir H, Frank Heath, juCB., Secretary to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, te* deal with various questions arising out of the conclusions of the Conference as to the future of the Institute and the Bureau.     The Committee submitted their Report to the late Secretary of State on the 18th of January.     From
their Report it is &quot; evident that a number of preliminary steps-; towards the reorganisation have already been takens     The Committee devoted considerable time to the preparation of a draft Bill to give effect to the conclusions of the Conference.This Bill, which is, appended to the Report, was submitted for approval by the Committee aloni; with their other recommendations,,   5he text of the Bill was communicated early in December last to the Dominions for the information of the various Governments, and also to the India Office for - transmission to the Government of India.     She Governments of the Dominions and of India were also requested to state whether they were prepared to adopt the recommendations of tho Imperial Economic Conference in regard to the proposed reorganisation of the Institute, and to invite their Parliaments to provide the necessary contributions.   Circular despatches were also sent to the Colonies and protectorates, enquiring whether the local Governments would be prepared to guarantee certain fixed contributions for a period of years.V.     While Sir Prank Heath&apos;s Committee were occupied with the preliminary work of reorganisation, a meeting of the Executive Council of the Imperial Institute was held on the 12th December.     -,t this meeting Sir James Allen, High Commissioner for Eew Zealand, stated th-vfc certain of the Dominion Prime Ministers had altered their opinions from those expressed on behalf of their Delegations at the Imperial Economic Conference , and now desired that the Exhibition Galleries at the Institute should be retained. Thereupon the unofficial members of the Council unanimously^ passed the following resolution:-,that thr executive Council, while accepting the Imperial Economic Conference Report, suggests, without
prejudice to the carrying out of that Report, that a further opportunity should be afforde: to all Governments concerned to consider whether they would be prepared to find such further funds as would enable the Exhibition Galleries to bo retained,&quot;8U     The late oeoretary of State Immediately communl-eated this Resolution to the various dominion Governmentse He pointed out that the retention of-the Galleries would involve an addition to the expenditure contemplated by the Conference of approximately  13,000, of which about  8,000 would be due to less of the rent that would be obtained for the Galleries, and  5,000 to the cost of staff, etcB, required for their maintenance.   In order to make up this amount, the following proportionate increases would have to be made in the contributions recommended by the ConferenceDominions and India.

the Dominion Governments were asked to state as so,on aspossible whether they were prepared to make the additional contributions required for a period of five years.90     In reply to those communications theGovernments of Canada, lew Zealand and Newfoundlandexpressed their willingness to contribute the additionalproportionate amounts required.     The Government of theUnion of South Africa stated that they did not wish the exhibition Galleries to be retained, and desired to abide by the contribution of  1,200 agreed to during theEconomic Conference.     Mr.Bruce, the Prime Minister ofAustralia, wrote to the Duke of Devonshire that he wouldbe willing to reconsider the decision if all the otherGovernments concerned, including the British Government,wished the Galleries to be retained.     He understood,however, that there was no intention on the part of theBritish Government to reconsider their decision, and In iview of this and the lack of unanimity among the Dominions it appeared to him that no course could be foliowed other than to adhere to the conclusions of the Economic Conference. Mr.Bruce subsequently informed the Secretary of State at an interview that personally he would like to 3ee the Galleries retained if possible.     The Government of the Irish Free State, although a reminder has been sent, have not yet replied.10.     No communication was sent to India in regard to the proposed retention of the Galleries, because it was thought that in view of the attitude of the Indian Government&apos;s representative at the Imperial Economic Conference there was practically no hope that the Government of India would agree to contribute in future towards the maintenance of the Galleries.-  It was also-9-
understood that the immediate expenditure involved, if the exhibit a in the Indian collections at the Institute were to be renewed, would amount to several thousand pounds, and that in addition a very considerable annual contribution would be required to keep the collections, up-to-date.     There was also the further difficulty that the Government of India could now no longer be responsible for maintaining suoh collections, which would in future come within the competence of the various Provincial Governments.11.     While the answers from the Oversea Governments to his enquiry were still incomplete, the late Secretary of State was made aware of a genarous offer by Viuuount Oowdray to the Prince of Wales of an annual donatlea of  5,000 for a period of five years towards the maintenance of the Exhibition Galleries.     At an interview at the Colonial Office, the Duke of Devonshire explained to Lord Cowdray the difficulties In the way of reversing the decision to close the Galleries, in view of the lauk of unanimity among the Governments concerned.     lord Cowdray was impressed by these difficulties, but wished it to be understood that hi3 offer of  5,000 for five years to maintain the Galleries still stood for any use that the Secretary of State might care to make of it.12.     In view of the fact that within the previous few weeks four of the Dominion Governments had-declared in favour of retaining the Galleries, and that, moreover, a revenue of  5,000 a year was unexpectedly assured through Lord Oowdray&apos;s offcer, the late Secretary of State decided on the 17th January that he could not proceed further with the scheme of reorganisation and that, as time was
so short, he must leave it to tho next Government to     f^4)0 fj uconsider, in the light of the new conditions that had arisen, whether or not they should ahide by the conclusion of the Imperial Economic Conference that the Exhibition Galleries of the Imperial Institute should be discontinued,13.     Consequent on this decision the Duke of Devonshire felt that he could not adopt the Report of the Inter depart-mental Committee (referred to in paragraph 6), which was presented to him on tho 1.8th of January.   It was clear that, if the Galleries were to be retained, the recommenda-tions in paragraph 13 of the Committee&apos;s Report for the disposal of the collections of exhibits at the Institute could not be carried into effect, and also that tho draft Bill would require revision in the light of the new condition14.     I have thought it advisable to set out in s.ome detail the sequence of events during the late Government&apos;s regime, as it is important that before coming to a decision my colleagues should bo able to follow the various steps that have necessitated my laying the matter before them.15.     I shall now describe what has taken place sinco the present Government came into power.   On the 6th of February the future of the Institute and the Mineral Resources bureau was fully discussed at a Conference in the Colonial Office, under the Chairmanship of lord Arnold, the under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, at which representatives of the Treasury, the Board of Trado, the Colonial Office, the India Office, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Department of Overseas Trade, and tho Office of V/orks were present.
MroWilliam Graham, M.P,, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, also attended this conference.     The general opinion of those present was that it would be best that the Government should proceed with the scheme of re-organisation approved by the Imperial Economic Conference;   but that, in view of the changed attitude of certain of the Dominion Governments since the Conference;   of the opposition which might be expected in Parliament to the abandonment of the Galleries;   and of the generous offer of Lord Oowdray to contribute  5,000 pei-1 annum for five years towards their maintenance, the scheme must be modified in so far as the closing down of the Galleries was concerned.     The Treasury should consider the possibility of making the comparatively small additional contribution required from this count xry.     Mr, Graham said that the Treasury would require time to consider the matter.16. In a letter dated 20th of February the Treasury informed the Colonial Offioe of how far they wore prepared to go.     They said that they would not press their objections to the retention of the Exhibition Galleries, and that they would be prepared to sanction the payment of the additional proportionate contribution (understood to be about  288o) towards their maintenance required from His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the condition that about 25,COO cubic feet of space in the Exhibition Galleries was made available at once, or in the near future, for the housing of such part of the Imperial War Museum as could not be accommodate^! in the Science Galleries adjoining the Imperial Institute buildi The Treasury pointed-out that there was no other building available to house the War Museum, that to erect a new buildi
would cost a very large sum of money, and that it would be    y*rjy most uneconomical to waste the money which had been spent on fiting up the Science Galleries for the portion of the War Museum that now occupied them.     It was understood that neither India nor the Union of South Africa wished to retain their Galleries In the Institute, and that for the space at present assigned to them, there was no use which could be made without expenditure.     Out of these Galleries the Treasury could easily obtain the 25,000 ft. which they required.17. If therefore the Colonial Office would allow the draft Bill, which gave power to the Institute to let off space which it did not require, to proceed;   and if a firm undertaking were obtained from the Institute authorities that so much space as was required for the War museum -believed to be about 25,000 feet, of the Exhibition Galleries were reserved for the use of His Majesty&apos;s Government (at a rent payable to the Institute on the same basis as the  8,000 agreed to previously in respect of the whole Galleries), the Treasury would consent to pay an increase on the sum of  9,000 per annum to cover the United Kingdom share of the deficit due to the loss of the  8,000 rental.     The Treasury&apos;s total contribution would, therefore, in this event be some-thing under  12,000 per annum, and they would have to pay in addition rent, on the above basis, for 24,000 or 25,000 feet of the Galleries, as might be required.     Finally, the Treasury assumed that the Colonial Office had firm offers from the Dominions and Colonies in respect of their qiiotas for each of the requisite fivs&quot;years, and stipulated that if any of them failed to contribute in any year, the United Kingdom share wotild not Increase, but that the whole position would be reconsidered, i.e, the activities of the Institute would be curtailed.18, This communication from the Treasury now makes it possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide whether It can approve the introduction into Parliament forthwith of a
and the Imperial Mine-pal Resources Bureau on the lines approved by the Economic Conference, but providing for the retention of the Exhibition Galleries of the Institute, subject to the conditions specified in the Treasury letter, particularly, that part of the War Museum must be housed In the Institute Galleries.     The insistence of the Treasury on this condition is now the outstanding difficulty.
