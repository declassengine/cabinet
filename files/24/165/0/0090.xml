[This Document k the Property of His Kritannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.    March 1924,)SECRET.CP. 186/24.SINGAPORE.It was mentioned in the Cabinet on the 12th March that the replies of the Dominions had been received, though the reply from India was still outstanding. I should explain that the reply which I circulate below had iji fact been received on the 8th March; but that, since the Secretary of State for India is the official spokesman of the Government of India, and his position corresponds broadly to that of a Dominion Prime Minister in these matters, it has been the practice not to circulate the Government of India&apos;s replies as a matter of course unless they contain views which the Secretary of State wishes to bring to the notice of his colleagues. I propose, however, in future to circulate the replies or their substance in order to make the records complete. It will, no doubt, continue to be understood that under the existing constitution the final responsibility for the views expressed on behalf of India rests with the Secretary of State.14th March 1924. OLIVIER.From Viceroy,.7th March 1924.Private. Secret. Singapore Naval Base, We have never been consulted or informed regarding the detailed reasons or exact plan of the policy of the late Government to create a new naval base at Singapore, and cannot usefully make any observations upon your decision. It should be remembered that policy has been neither initiated nor advocated by the Government of India.7182     125  3.24
