SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 78.PART I. BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The decision of the Suin-erne Court, of Canada on the validity of the Order in Council cancelling exemptions has settled an important point ; this must cause relief to those responsible for seeing that the Dominion reinforcements are sent forward, without delay^. There appears still to be some feeling in the Dominion that, notwith-stancling this decision, Parliamentary sanction should be given to the course the Government have taken in cancelling exemptions.The Labour troubles amongst the railway shopmen seem now to be nearlj&quot; overcome, and there is every probability that a strike-will be prevented.French-Canada will continue to be represented in the Cabinet by Colonel Blond in, who has now been made a Senator.The Registration of the Canadian people has been proceeding satisfactorily, and is on the verge of completion.Australian Commonwealth.The French Mission to Australia, to which attention was called in a previous Report, is of particular interest. The names of those composing the Mission indicate that commercial and agricultural interests are represented.The recruiting arrangements made by the State Recruiting Committees contemplate a voluntary ballot scheme, the working of which will be watched with interest. The message from General Monash illustrates the importance of national action in this connection.The Resolution of the Federal and State Conference about the non-increase of expenditure of Commonwealth and State Departments is of importance, as also is the statement of Mr. Watt about Loan issues.The announcement about the methods for raising the next War Loan should be noted.New Zealand.The Press of the Dominion appears unanimously to endorse the recent declaration of Sir Joseph Ward about the Pacific Islands.

2South Africa.The Interesting account of South Africa&apos;s achievements in the war, which was summarised by Mr. Asquith last week, is given in this Report.The observations of Mr. Burton upon Republicanism and the Nationalists in South Africa are particularly illuminating.The evidence given against the International Socialists who endeavoured to raise trouble amongst the natives seems to be somewhat conflicting ; though there is no doubt that a conspiracy was in existence.Foreign Colonies.The observations of General Northey as to the progress of the campaign in East Africa deserve attention.The extract from the article by Captain Persius, which criticises the German Colonial system, will be read with interest.G.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.Validity of Cancelled Exemptions : Habeas Corpus Case Decision. The Supreme Court of Canada (vide Report No. 77), by a majority of four to two, has upheld the validity of the Order in Council of April 20th, which cancelled the exemptions of men in Class 1 under the Military Service Act between the ages of 20 to 22 inclusive. Chief Justice Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, Justices Sir Louis Davies, Duff, and Anglin, concurred in the decision, while Justices Idington and Brocleur dissented.The majority judgment, which was prepared by Justice Anglin, is a lengthy document, upholding the right of the Governor-General in Council, under the authority of the War Measures Act of 1914, to take any steps necessarv for the successful prosecution of the war by the Dominion.The minority decision, which was drawn up by Justice Iclington, stated that an Act of Parliament was necessary to abolish exemptions, and that the Order in Council was idtra vires on the part of the Government.The application of Private Edwin Grey for a writ of habeas corpus was therefore refused, and a precedent is thereby established which effectHely disposes of many other cases now pending in various parts of the Dominion. The Order in Council of April 20th affected 40,000 young men.The judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada has been received with much satisfaction in Government circles. Although the judgment is essentially one of legal interpretation, the effect is most important in that it means that reinforcements will lie sent overseas without any hampering processes and the delay of habeas corpus applications. The judgment prevents any such disturbance or interference with the country&apos;s military effort.The lower Courts will be bound to accept the ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada, which has definitely established the validity of the Governments order.Satisfaction is also expressed in official circles that the points at issue have been so expeditiousiy disposed of. The celerity with which the questions were decided is probably without precedent in the history of the Supreme Court of Canada. .Had a judgment been delivered similar to that given in the Supreme Court of Alberta on the Lewis case, the administration of the Military Service Act would have been seriously prejudiced, and, pending rectification b3r Parliament in a specially called session, no men of the class affected by the Order in Council could have-been legally sent overseas.Labour Troubles : threatened Railway Strike. Reports from labour circles in Montreal indicate that it is unlikely that the threatened strike of the Federated Railway Trades will be declared, and the representatives of the Federated Railway Trades who have been in Conference have disbanded indefinitely.The men have been presumably awaiting amendments to the McAdoo schedule of wages which are expected to be issued in the United States on Thursday next. If these are satisfactory, the men are likely to accept the schedule without any further trouble. Meantime,-the workers&apos; representatives who are still in Montreal have been communicating with the various organisations throughout the Dominion in order to keep in touch with the feeling of their members.The organisations of the condiictors, engineers, and trainmen are ready to accept the schedule and are known to be opposed to extreme demands, and these workers will probably exercise, a considerable influence on the decision.8
The Montreal-Stars Washington correspondent states that at a meeting of the presidents of the International Union of Shopmen, held in the United States capital, it was decided not to countenance a strike on the Canadian roads. The correspondent declares that the Canadian workers will be excommunicated and left to shift for themselves if they refuse to accept the McAdoo schedule as amended and go on Strike.Progress of Registration. A total registration of over 5,000,000 people is predicted by Senator Gideon Robertson, the head of the Canada Registration Board, who states that he hopes to be able to announce the complete returns shortly.Reports from 201 out of 230 constituencies in the Dominion show that a total of 4,800,000 persons above the age of 16 registered.&quot; The total registration will exceed our estimate,&quot; stated Senator Robertson, &quot;and the results are very satisfactory.&quot;Shipbuilding in Quebec. Anew shipbuilding concern has been formed in Quebec, with a capital of $5,000,000, tot operate one of the largest shipyards in America on the shore of the St. Lawrence opposite Quebec city.The new company wiil take in a number of existing concerns, including the Federal Shipbuilding. Company, Sarnia : the Dominion Shipbuilding Company, Colling-wood ; and the firm of Dassault and Hutchinson, Levis. The firm will build steel shins for the French Government, and work on docks and yards has already begun.The Federal and Dominion Companies have ceased building ships at their Ontario plants.Dominion Postmaster-General. The difficulty connected with the defeat of Lieutenant-Colonel P. E. Blondin, the Dominion Postmaster-General, at the recent General Election has now been met by the appointment of Colonel Blondin as a Senator. A representative of French Canada will thus be retained in the Cabinet..     AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.French Mission to Australia. With reference to the French Mission which it was announced in Report, No. 59 would be proceeding to Australia at the invitation of the Commonwealth Government to consider various matters, mainly of a commercial and scientific character, affecting the two countries, it has been officially stated that the Mission arranged to leave Paris on July 23rd, and should arrive in Australia during the first half of September. The Mission will consist of Monsieur met in (President of the Mission), General Pan, Messrs. Math ion (Silk Merchant of Lyons), Gravier (Metallurgical Delegate who joins in United States), Thomsen (Wood Sculptor, representing Labour), Corbiere (Agricultural Engineer), Le Clerq Mette (Wool. Manufacturer), Andre Siegfried (General Secretary of Mission). The Mission will also have attached to it Commandant Andre (to accompany General Pan), Monsieur Bacler, a French merchant in Australia, who will act as Secretary and Accountant of Mission, and Mr. Meadows Smith (Commonwealth Representative).Message from United States. The Governor-General has received the following-message from President Wilson in reply to 4th of July greetings : &quot; The people of the United States send their warmest greetings to the people of Australia, They sincerely appreciate the friendly sentiments of your message, and wish, in reply, to express their pride in being associated with the gallant sons of Australia in this great struggle, which illustrates in eveiything that lies at the heart of itself the deep convictions of right and. liberty which underlie the political life of both people. I am happy in their name to send their heartiest fraternal greetings.&quot;Recruiting. The conference of delegates of the State Recruiting Committees was concluded&quot;at Melbourne on July 19th. The Minister for Recruiting (Mr. Orchard) presided, and said that a uniform plan of action under a voluntary ballot scheme had been arranged.   The ballot scheme provides for drawing a ballot quarterly in all
electoral subdivisions among men voluntarily submitting. It was decided to establish a central Publicity Department and also to form women&apos;s organisations in all States on similar lines to the W.A.A.C. in Great Britain and Victoria. It was also decided -to use more widely cinematograph films. It was announced that a request had been sent to Great Britain for the latest films.An appeal for recruits is published by the Commonwealth Press from General Monash, who says : &quot; Already some battalions which have made historic traditions have ceased to exist as fighting units, and others must follow unless the Australian nation stands by us.&quot;The New South Wales Parliament has adjourned for a month to give members an opportunity to participate in the recruiting campaign.Oommornoealth and State Finance.-At the Federal and State Treasurers&apos; Conference a resolution was passed that the unanimous opinion of the Treasurers present was that the ordinary aggregate of expenditure of all Commonwealth fand State departments should not be further increased during the war. Mr. Watt in a statement to the Press said that the loan requirements of the States had been discussed, the public works programmes of the Commonwealth and States had been carefully analysed, and the requirements of loan money for public works substantially reduced. He was hopeful of an agreement materially to restrict loan issues until the end of the calendar year 1919. Taxation officers had been directed by the Conference to rn&apos;ePare a form of income tax return for submission on July 20th.Next War Loan. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has announced that the Federal Government have decided to adopt new methods to raise the next war loan. The general management is to be entrusted to special.committees of financial and business men to act in an honorary capacity. The Central Loan Committee is to have the general control of a loan campaign in each State, and also to arrange with the local committees. The Treasurer will allocate the total amount required among the various States. The total will then be further subdivided among towns or districts, each of which will be expected to raise its allotted sum.The Pacific Lslands : Press and Mr. Hughes. The Sydney Sit)?, says that all thinking Australians are determined that the Pacific Islands must never be returned to Germany, and that Mr. Hughes in crystallizing opinion on this matter has amply justified his visit to London. If Germany were to obtain these islands she would within 20 years make naval bases and submarine depots of them and endanger for ever Australian aspirations to nationhood.Soldiers&apos; Mothers and Wives. At a meeting held at the Sydney Town Hall it w-as decided to form a New South Wales Soldiers&apos; Mothers and Wives&apos; Association. Resolutions were passed in favour of eradicating from public life enemy agents and sympathisers, condemning disloyal utterances, declaring unswerving loyalty, and urging vigorous recruiting.NEW ZEALAND.Tlie Pacific Islands: Dominion Press and Sir J. Ward. The Press of the Dominion have commented upon Sir Joseph Warchs recent declaration regarding&apos; the Pacific. Press cables state that the Dominion says that New Zealanders emphatically endorse Sir Joseph WarcPs statement declaring that the return of the conquered Pacific Islands to Germany would be wicked folly, and would produce bitter resentment throughout Australasia.The New*Zealanct Times eulogises Sir Joseph Ward and deprecates any considera-tion of Germany, whose object in demanding the return of the islands is the destruction of the Empire.The Post agrees that it would be worth 5 to 10 years&apos; fighting to save Australasia from the German menace, but Australasians must do a fair share of the fighting.It may be recalled that Sir Joseph Ward, in the course of his statement upon the Pacific on July loth, said that Resolutions had been passed at public meetings from end to end of the country before they left for England telling them that the public
would never tolerate the handing back of Samoa to Germany. An uneasy suspicion had been aroused that the former German colonies in the Pacific Ocean might be the subject of negotiation at the peace conference, and that in certain circumstances Samoa, New Guinea, and the Marshall Islands might revert to Germany. &quot; We say plainly,&quot; said Sir Joseph Ward, &quot; on behalf of the people of New Zealand -and the people of Australia are entirely with us in that respect that in no circumstances must any,such thing occur. On no question of public policy has opinion in the Dominions ever been more clear or united.&quot;It was unthinkable to the people in the outlying portions of the Empire, he proceeded, that Germany should ever again be permitted to gain a foothold in the Pacific, where she was an interloper from the first. Should such a calamity be allowed to befall New Zealand, the majority of its people would feel inclined to despair altogether of the Mother Country, and the bonds of Empire, which the war had knit so closely together, would be brought to straining point.SOUTH AFRICA.South Africa s part in the War. An interesting summary of the.effort of South Africa in the war was made by Mr. Asquith last week at a gathering of the Empire Parliamentary Association at the House of Commons. Regarding the German South-West Africa campaign, Mr. Asquith said : &quot;Immediately on the outbreak of the war the South African Government agreed to undertake operations in German South-West Africa, which involved the conduct of a campaign of considerable magnitude in a theatre which presented exceptional and, I suppose, unexampled difficulties. Despite the preoccupation occasioned by the unhappy rebellion in October 1914, the campaign was carried through by the resources of South Africa and Rhodesia virtually without assistance from the United Kingdom or other parts of the Empire. South African troops had, it is true, the enormous, the incalculable, advantage of being led by General Botha himself; but as soon as July 1915, the German forces were penned in and forced to surrender, and a territory of over 320,000 square miles, with a population of 15,000 Europeans and over 80,000 natives, passed into the military occupation of the Union Government. In the course of that campaign some 40,000 troojDs from the Union and Rhodesia took part, exclusive of the native and Cape coloured auxiliaries.&quot;Turning to other theatres of war, Mr. Asquith said : -&quot; Apart from that South-West campaign, the Union has raised and sent abroad to various theatres of war over 60,000 men. In East Africa hostilities were upon a larger scale even than in the South-West, and the difficulties of military invasion were perhaps more serious. In co-operation with the Belgian-Congo forces, and with General Northey operating from Rhodesia, General Smuts, to whom, as&quot;.all soldiers know, the credit for what has happened and is going to happen is very largely due, in March 1916 opened the campaign. I do not -think it is sufficiently realised or appreciated what a tenacious resistance the enemy made. They happened to find at their head a commander of very exceptional strategic and tactical ability and know-ledge . . . and, utilising the advantages, as they did, of what was a virtually trackless and almost wholly inhospitable territory, they were one of the most elusive bodies that any General ever had to pursue.&quot; In the end it was a very distinguished South African General, General Van Deventer, who completed the task which General Smuts had begun, and succeeded at the end of- November last year in driving all the enemy forces, now reduced to a very insignificant band in point of numbers, from their colony, and compelled them to maintain themselves, as they are now doing, with g-reat difficulty and hardship in Portuguese territory.&quot; In Egypt, the South African troops have played . a very distinguished part, and in France they have clothed themselves with imperishable fame, and Delville Wood will remain for them, as it does for some of us, a landmark in history. In all, some 26,000 officers and men have taken part in these operations in Egypt and France.&quot;
The Republican Movement: Mr. Burton&apos;s View. Some important observations &quot;were made by Mr. Henry Burton, Union Minister of Railways and Harbours, at the gathering to which reference is made in the precediug paragraph regardino- the Nationalists and Republicanism in South Africa. Referring to the Republican movement, Mr. Burton said : -&quot; One must not minimise phenomena of this sort, but, on the other hand, it is also unwise unduly to exaggerate it. What I think I can say fairly and with safety is that I do not think there is any substantial danger of active violence in the shape of a rising or rebellion in South Africa. The movement is the consequence of the political doctrines of the Nationalist Party, and it is, I think, to a large extent, political in its objects. Probably votes are looked for more than anything else, and the movement ^naturally appeals to the population in the late Republics. But4 it does not appeal to, and is not received favourably by, the great bulk of our Dutch speaking fellow-countrymen. In Natal and the Cape Province, where they have lived for years under the British system of government, they have a lively appreciation of the advantages of the British system, and they are not at all likely to exchange those advantages for the extremely problematical benefits of Republicanism. The only substantial danger I see in the situation is that while the leaders do not intend any violence, their preachings and the dissemination of their doctrines are extremely likely, in a country like South Africa, to have a distinct effect on the minds of people who are not in a responsible position.&quot;As to the progress of the Nationalist movement, Mr. Burton observed :  &quot; Broadiy speaking, I should be disposed to say that the Nationalist movement is not making any substantial progress. ... It makes an appeal to &quot;the younger generation amongst our Dutch people, the students, and what one may term the young intellectuals.&quot;Regarding the Nationalist doctrine of &quot; South Africa first,&quot; Mr. Burton said :   &quot; We agree with them ; but they interpret &apos; South Africa first&apos; rather like our friends the Sein Feiners as meaning &apos; South Africa first; South Africa last; SouthAfrica all the time ; and South Africa alone.&apos;   We cannot accept that view.   .   .We s&amp;y we think that we have obligations towards others ; obligations towards theBritish Empire, for instance.&quot;The Native Labour Troubles : Charges against Agitators. The charges against the three International Socialists : Bunting, a solicitor, Tinker, a printer, and Hanscombe, a butcher, who were recentby arrested by order of the Union Government on a charge of inciting to public violence, was opened on July 15th. Two natives were similarly charged, and a police-boy gave evidence that a meeting was held in August last, over which Bunting presided, and at which the natives were urged to organise against the Capitalists.Evidence was also given to the effect that pamphlets were to be circulated among the natives along the reef, and the question arose as to how these pamphlets should be distributed in order that no suspicion might be aroused. The matter, however, was finally referred to a Committee.It was also made known that a native Labour Party existed but was of no. use as it had been formed under the guidance of the Government, and that another body, the Society of Industrial Workers of the World, was also in existence for the natives at Durban.At a subsequent hearing a native detective gave evidence as to attending a meeting in November 1917, when the natives present were told that the magistrates would never do justice to a black man.   At a later meeting Bunting said, &quot; General , Botha has heard of the Socialist organisation among the natives, and is beginning to fear it.&quot;Another of the accused, Tinker, said that if the natives of South-Africa organised and combined with the white workers they could easily get what they wanted. The only thing necessary was to come out on strike, but in order to be successful they must come out, not in smaR numbers of 200 or 2,000, but rather 10,000.A sensation occurred at the adjourned hearing on July 18th when a witness for the Crown, a native named Luke Messina, who had tendered most of the evidence xegarding Socialist meetings, turned under cross-examination and denied the truth of
the majority.of his statements. He declared that he had not even attended two meetings regarding which he had given evidence, and that he did not know Bunting.Counsel for the Crown intimated that he would not oppose hail for the accused on his own recognisances, but could not state whether he Would withdraw the charge.Governor-General and Natives. The Governor-General (Lord Buxton), when making a tour of the Cape native territories, in a speech on July 17th, dwelt on the splendid relations between the Europeans and natives. He praised the work of the native contingent, and affirmed that the natives had a real friend in General Botha. He was glad to see the progress the natives had recently made. The Germans, said His Excellency, would like to take the British Colonies, but the Germans would not be victorious. The Germans had always treated natives brutally, and there were no sympathetic German magistrates to protect them as under British rule. His Excellency concluded with a grave warning against enemy agents who had been attempting to raise hostility to the King and the Union.INDIA.[Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Constitutional Reforms : Indian Opinion. Various opinions from different parts of India regarding the Report on Constitutional Reforms have been reported in the Press during the week.In Bombay, it appears, the vernacular papers do not give strong support to the scheme, but for the most part the Press are more favourable to the scheme as a whole than the Madras and other journals appear to be. The extreme view in Bombay is represented by the Chronicle and at Poona by the Kesari, which &quot;says that Mr. Montagu&apos;s spirit is not exhibited in the actual proposals.Press extremism in Bombay is not supported (according to the correspondent of the London Times) by manifestoes similar to that signed by 17 Madrassis alleging that the scheme cannot form the basis of discussion or compromise.Sir Fazulbhoy Currimbhoy suggests that the Report should have outlined a scheme such as is likely to obtain in an advanced province like Bombay in the near future, because he cannot conceive that the extreme caution of the recommendations is prompted by the conditions obtaining there. He considers that the excellent principles of the scheme would be better appreciated if the authors explained their intentions in regard to a province like Bombay.Mr. Paranjpye, the well-known principal of the Fergusson College, Poona, appeals for the consideration of the proposals in a generous spirit of compromise. He considers that the main defect of the scheme is that it leaves the Government of India practically uncontrolled by the opinion of the people&apos;s representatives. He presumes that each Parliamentary Commission will consider the cpiestion of full responsibility for the Government of India, and if the scheme succeeds in practical working that goal will be reached in a few years.Other Bombay Indians giving opinions include Mr. Mahomed Hajibhoy, Sherif of Bombay. He considers that the liberal nature of the provincial reforms emphasizes the restrictive character of the suggested reforms in the Imperial Government. He suggests that the proportion of the Indian element on the Imperial Executive should be the same as in the provincial executive. He suggests also that the elective principle should be as complete in the Council of State as in the Legislative Assembly. There cannot, he says, be two opinions regarding the inherent worth and future promise of the measures taken to secure provincial autonomy. The scheme, though full of great potentialities, leaves much to be desired in the direction of the grant of fiscal autonomy to India, wherein lies the salvation of India.&apos; Mr. Phiroze Sethna suggests that in the progressive provinces all subjects should be transfers erred, thus avoiding the necessity of a dual arranoement. He admits that at the back of the scheme is a desire and conviction that the ultimate end is responsible government for India within the Empire. If we are not given the irreducible minimum, that minimum and more is certainly within sight. It will not do to force the pace. The public must have faith and continue, conscious that the future must open to India more and more, and is already opening.6073-4o c
Mr. Tilak, the Indian Nationalist leader, is reported in a Press cable to have stated, in the course of an interview on the Indian reform scheme: &quot;It is entirelv unacceptable, and will not satisfy anybody. It is only a miserable cheese-paring measure, proposed in the interests of the bureaucracy, whose vested interest must always remain adverse to our aspirations. We must now take our case to England and appeal to the British democracy.&quot;A Reuter message from Bombay states that a special session of the National Congress will be held in Bombay in the middle of August in connection with the Constitutional reform scheme. *The Times of India in a Press article states :-&quot; The scheme may well be called the great adventure .... We do not believe the adventure will fail; on the contrary, we are convinced that it ought to be crowned with a success which will make Great Britain&apos;s mission to India the ijath to full self-government and the most glorious stage in her history. But we shall not win success if we do not approach the task with the fullest sense of responsibility. The scheme will not and cannot satisfy everybody.&quot;Press reports from Calcutta state that much reserve is shown in discussing the Report. A section of European opinion regards it as a clever and honest attempt at a compromise between the existing Legislative Councils and full self-government. Another section regards the scheme as too nicely balanced, its working virtually depending on the Provincial Governors. The Indian moderates are highly pleased, and the extremists so far reticent.The correspondent of the London Times at Simla states that the Report is favourably received except by those whom no possible proposals would satisfy. Cleavage, it is remarked, has been evident for some time past amonglndian politicians, this being accentuated by the attitude of the extremists. There is evidence that responsible public men are disposed to offer more definite opposition to the irreconcilables.A public statement on the joroposed Indian Constitutional Reforms has been made by Mr. Bhupendra Nath Basu, who was formerly one of the leaders in the Indian National Congress, and who is now a Member of the Secretary of State&apos;s -Council.   Mr. Basu accompanied Mr. Montagu during his recent visit to India.   In the course of this statement the following passage occurs-:  &quot; These proposals provide the steps to be taken to change critics into responsible administrators. Naturally the scheme proceeds cautiously ; some people might wish that the scheme were bolder and gave greater powers to the people to start with ; but the Report is not final in the matter of demarcation of functions between the Executive-Government and the pjopular Assembly, for it leaves this demarcation to a committee where we may establish that the allocation of &quot;functions so far as the popular Assembly is concerned should be on a generous scale. The Report, however, makes it clear that for the first time Indian popular representatives will be put in charge of important departments of Government in the provinces, and will thus have a chance of proving-their capacity of remedying the admitted deficiencies in education, sanitation and local self-government. The departments which will not be transferred will have to- be-administered in consultation with popular Ministers and subject to the criticism of&quot; popular Assemblies which will be vastly stronger than the Councils, and the Budget as a whole will be framed by the Executive Government and popular Ministry in consultation with standing committees in which popular representatives will be in a majority.&quot;Constitutional Reforms : German View. The German Wireless of July 22nd remarks that the Lyons Wireless &quot; has the courage to defend the English domination of India, and appropriately connects the reform plans of the London Government with the manifestations of German interest in the affairs of India.&quot;The German Wireless continues : &quot; The reference to the fact that English statesmen since 1858 have talked about reforms in India, but that nothing has been done within the past 60 years to .promote India&apos;s development, is of great value for the Indians, who will recognise that the renewed promises of Montagu and Chelmsford will remain nothing but beautiful words if Germany does not continue to exercise pressure on Great Britain. It is only due to the German sword that the English, have been forced&quot; at all to think of concessions for India, If these concessions do not remain on paper only, 300 millions of Indians will have Germany to thank for it.&quot;
GERMAN EAST AFRICA.Progress of Campaign. In an interesting speech, in Cape Town last week, the Governor of the East Africa Protectorate (General Northey) said the Germans were commanded by the redoubtable General von Lettow, &quot;whose hand he would be proud to shake for he had fought cleanly from start to finish. The enemy^s force. General Northey said, was now about 100 Europeans and from 700 to 800 fighting Askari, who had had four years&apos; war experience and whom Ave were opposing with natives raised during the war. The fact that the campaign was unfinished was due to the enormous size of the country and the density of the bush, the result of which was that the enemy when rounded up were able to escape when within 50 yards of being cornered. At present, he added, the enemy Avere 500 miles from their own country near Quelimane, and might be caught any day with a little luck ; otherwise it might take months. Everything possible, however, was being done to bring the campaign to an end.The latest official report from General HaAvthorn states that the enemy, who were assisted in every way by local natiAres, evaded the British patrols and reached Ociva on July 14th where they are being opposed by the British troops.GERMAN COLONIES.German Colonial System: Need of Change. Captain Persius has an article in the Berliner Tageblatt of July 6th, entitled &quot; Our former Colonisation System,&quot; of Avhich the following is a short summary : &quot; It is worth Avhile considering what haAre been Germany&apos;s mistakes in the matter of colonisation, because unless the colonies bring in more profit than has been the case hitherto they are not Avorth haA-ing. Bismarck&apos;s idea Avas to treat them as &apos; commercial undertakings,&apos; and the foremost aim of every colonisation system should be to make them profitable to the mother country. Later GoArernments abandoned Bismarck&apos;s policy, and the result has been to cause distrust in the German people of all colonial&quot;efforts. When the first areas came under German protection few Germans had any experience of colonising, and, unfortunately, the authorities refused to learn from the experience of other countries. German colonists had always to complain of lack of appreciation on the part of the officials. Uniforms and trailing swords were always in evidence. There Avas respect for everything military, but for nothing civilian. There was, therefore, nothing to attract the German settler, and in the result no profit accrued to Germany.&quot;LIBERIA.War Telegrams. The British Consul at Monrovia has informed His Majesty:s Government that the British Colony throughout the country much appreciate the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government in arranging for Avar telegrams to be sent. These, it is stated, are arriving regularly and are making a very good impression in the country after the recent imfortunate eAgents.FOREIGN COLONIES.
