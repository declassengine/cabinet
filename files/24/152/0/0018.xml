SECRET.APPRECIATION  OE THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 93.PART I. BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs!The arrival before long of the Dominion Prime Ministers and Indian representa-tives for the discussion of peace questions will involve a session of the Imperial War Cabinet of historic importance. This will serve to bring home to the public, at home and oversea, the vital matters that can be dealt with under the new constitutional dispensation.The memorandum on the question of Japanese claims to the Pacific Islands north of the Equator is a useful reminder that both Australia and New Zealand were con-suited before a definite communication was made to Japan.The Imperial Preference proposals of the Economic Defence and Development Committee are of interest and importance.The proposed removal of anomalies connected with the Gallipoli decorations have met with the general concurrence of the Dominion GoA^ernments, subject to the alteration of date.Canada.The merely advisory capacity of a Dominion representative on Programme Committees is not considered a final solution of the problem by the Canadian Government.The Register which is being compiled regarding the position and intentions of soldiers on returning to civil life, should assist greatly the work of demobilisation. This and other items in the Report show that post-war problems are being carefully considered in the Dominion.The Governments shipbuilding programme aims at establishing a comprehensive scheme of connected and nationally owned steamships and railways.The reference in the Farmers&apos; political programme to the necessity of full discussion by the people before any change is made in the relations between Canada -and the United Kingdom is no doubt dictated by the usual fear of some encroachment upon autonomous rights.The reference in this Report to the part played by the Labour Unions in the war emphasises a satisfactory feature in the Labour situation of the Dominion. At the same time the spread of I. WAV. propaganda in the West has not always been sufficiently appreciated. [p.t.o.
Australian Common wealth .The references of the Prime Minister to the Dominions and peace discussions are important. It should not be forgotten, however, that at the sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917 and this year, there were full discussions on peace terms, and that the session about to be held will meet mainly for the purpose of such discussion. It will be noticed that Mr. Hughes&apos; pronouncement regarding German Colonies differs somewhat from the recent observations of the Acting Prime Minister (vide Report No. 86 and No. 9u).The return of an Official Labour candidate at the recent by-election in Western Australia means the loss of a seat to the Government, but the resident is robbed of significance through the Nationafist vote &quot;being split between two candidates.The details of Commonwealth casualties in the war up to October 28th afford a striking commentary upon the war effort of this young nation.New Zealand.It is not surprising, with the experiences of the New Hebrides before the Pacific nations, that the Prime Minister should issue a warning against any form of dual control fcr the islands of the Pacific.The references in Parliament to Japanese aid in the Pac-ific are of interest.The suggestion for a commercial representative in the United States indicates an aiDpreciation of the steps already taken in this direction by other &quot;Dominions. This together with the proposal for a Minister of Commerce show that the commercial community is alive to the importance of post-war trade problems.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The action taken by the Government of India to meet food difficulties should haVe a real political value.British Colonies and Protectorates.The extraordinary mobility of Von Lettow has now necessitated the evacuation of Fife, and may possibly affect other Rhodesiam towns.German Colonies.The German Foreign Office communication indicates that one of the main efforts willbe to regain some colonial possessions.The attitude, adopted by Mr. Lloyd George in Paris regarding territory captured by the Dominions will, naturally, give rise to great satisfaction oversea.11. d&apos;E.November 8th, 1918.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Imperial War Cabinet. In view of the war situation the Prime Ministers of Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, and representatives of India, are expected in England at an early date, in response to the invitation of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to attend meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet. (See also under &quot; Australian Commonwealth.&quot;)rPacific Islands : Australasia and Japan. In accordance with an undertaking-given to the Cabinet in August last, the Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Robert Cecil) issued on October 15th a memorandum for circulation to the Imperial War Cabinet on the question of Japanese claims to the Pacific Islands north of the Equator.   From it the following conclusions may be drawn : (1) The Governments of Australia and New Zealand were fully informed in March 1915 of the claims of the Japanese Government to the Pacific Islands north of the Equator, and of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which was that all acquisitions of German possessions in the Pacific must be held over for discussion in the final peace negotiations.(2) In the preliminary negotiations in 1916 concerning the adhesion of the Commonwealth Government to the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, Mr. Hughes defining Australia^ requirements as regards coastwise trade to Sir E. Grey, and subsequently in conversation with the Japanese Ambassador, assumed that Australia would retain the German islands south of the Equator, and that Japan would retain those north of that line.(3) In 1917, when the Japanese Government were being pressed to accede to the British Aclmiralty/s appeal for additional naval assistance, the Governments of the Commonwealth and New Zealand were consulted, and their assent obtained, before the assurance respecting the Pacific Islands north of the Equator was given to the Japanese Government.Imperial Preference: Proposals regarding Sugar. The Economic Defence and Development Committee had before them at a meeting on October 29th, 1918, the matter of an early declaration of the policy of the Government respecting Colonial sugar after the war. It was pointed out at the meeting that representatives of the British sugar trade contended that with a preference of one-third of the existing duty the Empire, could become self-supporting in a few years. The Committee expressed the opinion that the proposal made in the memorandum of the Secretary of State for the Colonies (G.T. 6082) followed naturally from the decisions of the Imperial War Cabinet on the grant of Imperial preference duties now or hereafter proposed, and that an early announcement as to, the amount of preference was desirable. The Committee considered that 33-J- per cent, was reasonable, but that any announcement should be so framed as to provide for special consideration of a temporary nature in the case of Allied countries with devastated areas. The Committee decided to ask for the approval of the AVar Cabinet regarding action on the above lines.Gallipoli Decorations: Proposed Removal of Anomalies. In reply to the telegram from the British Government regarding the removal of anomalies connected with the Gallipoli decorations (vide Report No. 91), the Government of the Australian Commonwealth have concurred generally in the proposed course, but point out that the date should be extended to cover the final evacuation of Gallipoli, and that the theatres of war should be extended to include the troops who fought in the Bismarck Archipelago. Otherwise, it is observed, men who served in certain Australian warships during the first year of war in that theatre would receive the medal which would not be given to the infantry who fought on land.
The South African Ministers concur in the proposals and explain that the rolls for the campaign in German South-West Africa are filed at the Union Defence Headquarters at Pretoria, and may be used as data for such rolls as the Army Council may direct.The Newfoundland Government does not agree to the date mentioned, which would exclude from the awards all the Newfoundland troops who took part in the campaign. If the time was enlarged to January 6th or 7th, 1916, the date on which the troops evacuated Plelles, the Newfoundland Government would concur in the proposal.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Prime Minister coming to England. The Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) has informed the British Government thatin response to the request of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he will sail for England at the earliest opportunity. (Vide also under &quot; Imperial Affairs.&quot;)Dominion Representation on Programme Committees. Regarding the suggested arrangement for the representation of Dominion interests on the Sugar Programme Committee, which involved the appointment of a Canadian representative to attend meetings in an advisory capacity (vide Report No. 87), the Dominion Government have telegraphed that they do not consider the proposed method entirely satisfactory but that they are ready to acquiesce for the present.Armistice Proposal: Governments Pledge. With reference to the German request for an armistice, the Dominion Minister of Militia (Major-General S. C. Mewburn) stated last week that :&apos; when all this peace talk started I took occasion to cable Sir Arthur Currie conveying to him Canada&apos;s pledge never to relax her war efforts and never to fail to stand squarely behind her army until final and complete victory is assured.&quot;Steps toioards Demobilisation.-Th.e members of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada have already filled in and signed cards issued by the National Service Council stating whether they were willing to go on the land after the war ; whether they would be able to return to the positions they formerly held ; what was their trade, and other particulars. All these cards, to the number of 240,000, have now been handed over to the Department of Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-establishment for analysis. As soon as the analysis is completed, the Department will know how many men want to go on the land, how many have capital, how many will be available for each trade, and how many have famihy ties which will prevent them moving from their home Provinces. In fact, it will be a very complete register of what members of the Overseas Military Forces intend to do when they return home to civil life. These figures will soon be available, and the first to be imblished will be those referring to land settlement.Conference on Demobilisation. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) ]ias called a conference of the Provincial Premiers to take place during November in order that an exchange of views may take place between the Dominion and Provincial Governments. It is understood that one of the questions to be discussed will be &quot;the demobilisation problem. It is hoped by co-operation to formulate a broad Canadian policy.Post-War Export Trade. Measures to meet post-war conditions in Canada have been urged on the Government by a delegation representing the Canadian Manu-facturers&apos; Association, the Canadian Industrial Reconstruction - Association, and the Toronto Trades and Labour Council. The delegates advocated the creation of an expert Commission to co-operate with the Government with a view to extending the export trade of the Dominion when peace is declared and there is a consequent cessation of Avar work in the munitions plants of the country.   It was decided, as a
result of the conference, to refer the whole problem to a committee, representing the manufacturing interests in agriculture and organised labour. The Committee will work in close co-operation with the Government.National Shipbuilding. The Dominion Minister of iShrval Service (Hon. C. C. Ballantyne) has issued a comprehensive statement, outlining in detail the Govern-ment&apos;s shipbuilding programme, which is of an ambitious and novel nature.After pointing out that 31 steel ships are now under construction, the.Minister-states that further contracts will be given in the near future, involving the building of several additional vessels of 10,500 tons. These will be built at Halifax, and probably at Vancouver.Mr. Ballantyne says that it is the intention of the Government to operate-national-owned vessels in connection with the C.N.R. system on the Atlantic, Pacific, and the Great Lakes. He points out that there will unquestionably be a very great demand for tonnage to carry the products of the field, mine, forest, and factory, as well as to bring back the Canadian soldiers.The Government have decided that the ships owned by the country shall be operated by a steamship company, which will be organised to work in co-operation with the Canadian national -railway scheme, free in all respects from interference of any kind, and under the management of Mr. D, B. Banna and his Board of:Directors. In agreeing to this policy the Minister said that the Government were following the system adopted by the C.P.R.Fanners&apos;&apos; Political Programme. The United Farmers of Ontario have tentatively agreed upon a political programme at a meeting of the executive officers, and it will coine up for final adoption at the annual convention in December. The main points-in the programme involve declarations in favour of absolute freedom of discussion ; no change in Canada&apos;s relations with the United Kingdom until after a full discussion by the Canadian people; repeal of the War-Time Elections Act ; and permanent Dominion-wide prohibition of the -manufacture, sale or importation of liquor. Another plank in the platform is the nationalisation of railways, telephones, telegraphs and similar services,Labour and 1.IF.ii8. Propaganda. The Dominion Minister of Public Works (Mr. Carvell) made an announcement last week regarding labour conditions, especially as regards the West, and stated emphatically that he believed there Avas a considerable distribution of I.W.W. and Socialist propaganda being carried on in all parts of the Dominion, but more especially in the Western Provinces. He said that some of the labour leaders had fallen under this influence, but expressed strong.admiration for the big labour unions, which he declared had played the game during the war. He referred to unions, such as those of the railway conductors, engineers, trainmen, and telegraphists, and what is generally known as the Big Six, and many other of the-recognised trade unions were not in any way affected. In fact, he. thought the part plaved by the big labour unions during the war had been of such a high patriotic character that it was an absolute justification of their existence and evidence that, properly conducted, labour uuions could exert a wonderful influence for good in the country. The. Minister of Public Works stated that the Government was determined to put &quot;an end to strikes in essential industries while the war was in progress.. &quot; Every man who is physically fit must either work or fight,&quot; he concluded.Social Conditions of Montreal. A committee of 16 persons, which has conducted an investigation into the social conditions of Montreal, reports on the prevalence there of vice and the existence of systematized prostitution. It suggests that a committee should be appointed to raise moneyto provide information concerning actual conditions and to develop a sensitive and informed public opinion.Victory Loan and Savings. Those taking part, in the Victory Loan campaign announce great progress in all parts of the Dominion. The reports indicate that the results of the present campaign will be considerably in excess of the achievements of the last, and the subscriptions had already reached one hundred and fifty, million dollars at the end of the first week of the campaign,The relation of the Savings Banks deposits to the Loan has been officially referred to by the Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. A. Calder) who observes;
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Prime Minister and Peace Discussions. The Prime Minister of the Common-wealth (Mr. Hughes) has telegraphed to his constituents at Bendigo stating that owing to the dramatic change in the military situation and the possibility of early peace, his colleagues and members of the National Party have strongly urged him to remain in England to safeguard Australia V interests. He states that the need for Australia to be represented at this juncture is imperative and that long before the formal Peace Conference, the peace conditions which will determine the destiny of Australia, the Empire, and the whole world, will be practically settled. After peace, Mr. Hughes indicates, there will be many problems, including demobilisation and repatriation, which will need attention ; but he feels that he cannot remain on this side without the consent and approval of his constituents. In reply, a message has been sent to Mr. Hughes informing him that his Bendigo constituents carried a motion recognising that during the present critical time the vital interests of Australia and the Empire imperatively require the presence of the Prime Minister in the mother country, and affirmed.: &quot; We approve the decision to remain until peace terms are definitely settled, and pledge ourselves to accord him the fullest measure of moral and material support.&quot;Minister for the Navy. In connection with the preceding paragraph, it is. under-stood that the Commonwealth Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) will remain in England with Mr. Hughes.Consultation on Peace Terms : German Colonies. Mr. Hughes referred publicly on November 7th to the A^ersailles Council, observing that not only had the terms of the armistice been settled, but those of peace also. He stated: &quot;In the settlement of the terms of peace the Dominions have not been consulted. They have been informed of those terms, as, indeed, has every other citizen throughout the Empire, but &quot;have had no share in shaping them. ... It may be said that the Dominions will have an opportunity of expressing their opinions at the Peace Conference. It may be that this will be so. But it is perfectly clear that the deliberations of the delegates at the Peace Conference will be limited by the terms of peace already settled.   Beyond this they cannot go.&quot;As to the retention of the German colonies, Mr. Hughes said : &quot; There is another point in these peace terms to which I object. I see no statement in the document of the Supreme Council that the German colonies shall not be given back to Germany. I have been informed that the British Government do not intend to give them back ; but I see no mention of it in&apos; the bond. ... On behalf of the Australians who have fought in this war, and of the Australian people, whose very existence depends on the retention of those islands in the Pacific which formerly belonged to Germany, either in our own hands or in the hands of Britain, I demand that it shall be set out in the peace terms.&quot;Consultation regarding Pacific Islands.1 An important Memorandum by the Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which reference is made to the steps taken to consult the Commonwealth as to the Japanese claim to the Pacific Islands north of the Equator, is referred to under &quot; Imperial Affairs&quot; (vide also Report No. 3).Commonwealth and Surrender of Turkey. The news of Turkey&apos;s surrender caused widespread public rejoicing throughout the Commonwealth. The Parliaments cheered it, the cities were beflagged, bells were rang, and crowds sang the patriotic airs of the Allied nations.G817-la B&quot; The people of Canada have in their Savings Banks more than twice the amount which the country is asking for in the &apos; Victory&apos; Loan campaign which has now begun. Since January last, when the full force of the last Dominion Loan was being felt the saving public has added approximately 136.000,000 dollars to its balance in the Banks, thus showing that Canadians are not spendthrift in war time. Current loans in Canada amounted in September to more than 22,000,000 dollars more than the August figures and approximately 87,500,000 dollars over the total for September 1917.&quot;
By-Election in Western Australia. In the Swan (Western Australia) by-election which was rendered necessary by the death of Lord Forrest (Nationalist), the Official Labour candidate, who is also a returned soldier (Mr. Corboy), has won tbe seat, through the Nationalist vote being split between two candidates. The Official Labour candidate had secured 6,249 votes up to October 31st, while the two Nationalist opponents scored 10,987. The Prohibitionist candidate only polled a comparatively small number of votes:, -      -Commonwealth Casualties. Australia&apos;s casualties up to October 28th amounted to : Dead   -            - -            -            -    54,431Missing  -            - -            -         -          93Prisoners            - -              -              -       3,401Wounded and gassed -             -          -   156,173Sick cases         - -             -            -    75,877Not specified         - -            -                   216Total - - -   290,191Progress of Recruiting. A marked improvement was shown in recruiting for the week ended October 19th compared with the previous week.War Loan Total.-The war loan total is 42,677,640Z. The Federal Treasurer expects that the final figures wall reach 43,O0O,000LNaval Administration. The Royal Commission that is enquiring into the administration of the Naval Department applied on October 22nd to the Acting Attorney-General for legal assistance. This having been provided it was reported to the A ttomey-G eneral that the assistance was required for investigating the conditions under which the Navy Department had purchased the Shaw Wireless Works in New South Wales. In this it appeared that Mr. Jensen, the then Minister for the Navy and the present Minister for Trade and Customs, was implicated, and on the matter being brought to the notice of Mr. Jensen by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Jensen has asked to be relieved of his office until the completion of the investigation.Sedition Bill in New South Wales. The New South Wales Legislative Council is considering the Sedition Bill. Many members criticised the Bill on the ground that legitimate newspaper criticism would be liable to prosecution as sedition.NEW ZEALAND.Peace Conference and Padjic: Question of Dual Control. The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey),&apos; in addressing a conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce last week, is reported in a Press cable to have expressed delight at Mr. BalfouFs statement concerning the German colonies. lie believed that the Dominion had nothing to fear from the British Government, but, perhaps, the Peace Conference might be less favourable to the South Pacific standpoint. &apos;!The establishment of dual control.in the South Pacific Islands,&quot; Mr. Massey declared, &quot;would be the most serious mistake imaginable.&quot;(For reference to consultation with New Zealand as to the Pacific Islands north of the Equator, see under &quot; Rnperial Affairs,&quot; and also Report No. 3.)Japanese Assistance in the War. The news of the surrender of Turkey is stated to have created great enthusiasm in the Dominion. In moving and seconding the-adjournment of the House of Representatives in celebration of the news, Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward are reported to have spoken in similar terms, and paid a glowing-tribute to Japan, who had played the game and enabled Australasia to despatch troops, which would otherwise have been impossible. The House adjourned after singing the National Anthem.Representation in United States. The Conference of New Zealand Chambers of Commerce has resolved to recommend the Government to appoint immediately a commercial representative of the Dominion in Washington.
Suggested Minister of Commerce. The Conference of Chambers of Commerce, to which reference is made in the preceding paragraph, has recommended the Govern-ment to appoint a Minister of Commerce with an advisory council of experts. (For Australian action in this direction vide Report No. 81.)SOUTH AFRICA.Prime Minister&apos;s Visit to England. The Prime Minister of the Union (General Botha) has informed the British Government that in response to the invitation of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom he will be prepared to leave Cape Town for England any day after November 8th. General Botha is desirous of leaving at the earliest possible moment after the notification of an armistice. It is anticipated that Mrs. Botha and possibly two officials will travel with the Prime Minister.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Food Scarcity. The Government of India are engaged with plans for meeting the situation created by the failure of the monsoon over large areas. Beginning with wheat and rice, it is proposed to purchase supplies in the provinces, to obtain possession of the surplus, and to retail at fixed prices in the provinces where the shortage is felt. There are railway difficulties owing to the exigencies of the war, but efforts are being made to obviate all unnecessary traffic.The Viceroy has informed the Secretary of State for India that in order to control the inter-Provincial distribution of food, a single executive authority, to be designated Foodstuffs Commissioner, has been found necessary. In consultation with Provincial Governments, the Government of India will decide from time to time the quantities of foodstuffs available for transfer from surplus to deficit Provinces and the maximum prices for their purchase, which will be arranged for by the Foodstuffs Commissioner through the agency of selected - commercial firms. While dealing initially with wheat and rice, the control of other foodstuffs will be assumed by the Commissioner as occasion arises. Supplies will be allotted to those dealers in deficit Provinces who have been licensed -. by the Directors of Oivil Supplies, such licences being conditional on the dealers selling within the price fixed by the Rocal Governments, with clue regard to the prices paid by the Commissioner for his purchases. The Commissioner, though arranging for purchases and transport, will not finance the transactions, the funds being provided by arrangement between selected purchasing agents and licensed dealers. The Rocal Governments are also being told that where they consider such a step necessary they may open direct Government or municipal shops for direct sales of food-grains at fixed prices, the loss on such transactions failing on Provincial revenues.Rome Rulers and Reform Scheme Committees. It is reported from Bombay that Indian Home Rulers are trying to discredit the personnel of the Franchise and Subjects Committees owing to the fact that their nominees were not selected.Moderate Conference. Owing to the influenza epidemic, the Moderates were obliged to postpone their Conference at Bombay until November 1st and 2nd.BRITISH COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RHODESIA.Enemy and Northern. Border. Owing to the return of enemy forces to the northern border of Rhodesia, Fife had recently to be evacuated and preparations made for the evacuation of Abercorn and Kasama if necessary.
Income Tax and Excess Profits. By an Ordinance No. 20 of this year the Legislative Council provided a war levy on incomes and certain excess profits. Under this Ordinance the rate of income tax in respect of the taxable amount of an income is Is. for every 11. of the taxable amount. A duty of 40 per cent, of the amount of excess profits accruing to any person during the financial year is leviable under the Ordinance, subject to certain provisions.FOREIGN COLONIES IN AFRICA..   . GERMAN COLONIES.German Foreign Office View. The Weser Zeitung quotes a communication issued by the German Foreign Office on October 27th, which says : &quot; The German Foreign Office quite agrees with the view that peace negotiations must be conducted in the closest contact with German economic circles. It will regard it as one of its main tasks to regain the German Colonies, and will do every-thing to create a free path as soon as possible for the activities of German merchants abroad.&quot;Dominions and Captured Territory : Policy of British Government. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in recent discussions with Colonel House in Paris, made it clear that the British Government did not intend to restore the captured colonies to Germany and that the Dominions should retain the territory they had captured.
