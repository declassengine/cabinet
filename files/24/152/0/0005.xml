SECRET.APPRECIATION  OK THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No.. 80.PART I. BRITISH EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The Resolution.of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom relating to future methods of communication between the Prime Ministers of the Empire goes a con-siclerable distance towards the full recognition of the equality of political status between the United Kingdom and the sister nations of the Imperial Commonwealth.Another Resolution, which, like the foregoing, was unanimously accepted by the Imperial War Cabinet, recognises the necessity of continuous consultation between the Cabinets, and approves the important principle of the representation of each Dominion in London by a resident or visiting Cabinet Minister, who can thus repre-sent his Prime Minister at meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, which are to be held regularly in future. IE this Resolution is given effect to by the Dominions, the imperial War Cabinet will in fact become a body continuously in Session, though its actual meetings will presumably be less frequent when the Prime Ministers are away than during the time they are present at; what are termed the Plenary Sessions.Canada.   -A summary of the main achievements of the Dominion during four years of warappears in this Report.The statement that a Board of Railway Labour Commissioners, representativeof the employees and the Railway War Board, will be appointed.to deal with possiblelabour disputes during the war may go far towards preventing any recurrence of thestrike menace-It is satisfactory to note that the Western postal employees have now returnedto work.Amongst other items of interest in this Report are those relating to the skiUed farm workers who are proceeding to Western Canada from the United States, and to the financing of the wheat crop.Australian Commonwealth.Some further interesting figures regarding the Commonwealths war effort appear in this Report. The facts given by the Minister for Defence as to the supply of horses and ammunition have not hitherto receiA^ed the attention they deserve.The Acting Prime Minister has made a somewhat remarkable statement upon the pacifist forces which threaten to disunite the people of Australia. His observations (as reported in the Press) upon the disinterestedness of the Commonwealth in the ownership of the Pacific Islands, provided they do not return to Germany, are also worthy of close attention.Other points of interest appearing in this Report relate to recruiting, war-time prohibition, the use of the German language, &amp;c. [p.t.o.
2South Africa.The important speech of General Botha contains some striking references to matters affecting the general policy of the Union Government. His observations regarding the impossibility of the democratic Republic of the. United States keeping out of the war, and as to the war involving the liberty of South Africa, are no doubt specially addressed to Boers of Republican tendencies; while his estimate &quot;of the connection of General Hertzog with the recent internal troubles is calculated to counter the Nationalist attempt to exploit the situation in the interests of party politics. -It is particularly interesting to note that General Botha has emphasised the farmers&apos; dependence on the British Fleet for the disposal of their wool. The premier&apos;s reference to future action concerning the wool clip should be noted.The coming campaign in the Free State Province will be watched with considerable interest.The Press report of Mr. Malan&apos;s speech on immigration after the war furnishes a useful indication of what may be assumed, to be the attitude of the Union Government on this important subject.The views of Herr von Lindequist upon the probable political effects in the Union of the return of.South-West Africa to Germany are no doubt shared by other leading exponents of German thought. In any case, they serve to illustrate the strong German desire to assist the Nationalist movement in South Africa.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)Attention is particularly invited to the Appendix to this Report, which contains a valuable paper on Indian Constitutional Reforms, by Sir Satyendra Sinha. This paper is designed to assist the reader of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report by emphasising the principal changes that are involved and by helping to explain their significance.The various attitudes adopted by Heads of Provinces, Chiefs. Indian politicians, and Press, in relation to the Constitutional Reform proposals are illustrated to some extent by the facts given in the body of this Report. The proceedings of the forth-coming National Congress at Bombay will be of interest, but they will not necessarily, or even probably be indicative of Indian political opinion as a whole.H. d&apos;E.    &quot;August 8th, 1918.

part   I. BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Communication between Prime Ministers. At a meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet held on July 30th, 1918, the following Resolution, submitted by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Mr. Lloyd George), was accepted, namely: I. (1) The Prime Ministers of the Dominions, as members of the Imperial War Cabinet, have the right&quot; of direct communication with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and vice versa.(2) Such communications should be confined to questions of Cabinet import-ance.   The Prime Ministers themselves are the judges of such questions.(3) Telegraphic communications between the Prime Ministers should,-as a rule, be conducted through the Colonial Office machinery, but this will not exclude the adoption of more direct means of communication- in exceptional circumstances.Ministerial He-presentation in London. At the meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet, to which attention is called in the previous paragraph, a second Resolution was also accepted providing for a permanent method of consultation by means of the representation of the Dominion Cabinets in London. The Resolution on this head was as follows : II. In order to secure continuity in the work of the Imperial War Cabinet, and a permanent means of consultation during the war on the more important questions of common interest, the Prime Minister of each Dominion has the right to nominate a Cabinet Minister either as a resident or visitor in London to represent him at meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet to be held, regularly between the plenary Sessions.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Achievements during War. The Dominion Director of Public Information has issued a statement which contains a useful summary of the achievements of the Dominion during the four years of war (vide also Report No. 74). The main items in the statement are as follows : ;&quot; Men sent overseas, 390,000 ; training in Canada, 00,000 ; total 450,000.&apos;&apos; Number of Canadians who have given their lives for the Empire, including those killed&apos; in action, died of wounds, died of disease, and presumed to be dead, 43,000.&quot; Number appeared in casualty lists as wounded or sick, 113,007.&quot; Men returned to Canada unfit for farther service, 50,000.&quot; Number of soldiers and nurses who have received decorations, 10,000.&quot; Total value of orders placed in Canada by the British Government for munitions of war, -$1,200,000,000. Of this amount 8600,000,000 has been loaned to the British Government by Canada.&quot;The statement goes on to say that an astonishingly large percentage of munitions used by Great Britain was produced in Canada, and in this respect it is mentioned
that 55 per cent, of the total output of 18-pounder shrapnel shells for the British Army in the last sis months of 1917 were made in the Dominion. At one time there were 350,000 men and women employed on munition work in Canada.The amount lent by Canadians to the Government in the shape of war loans is $756,000,000, or $100 per head of the entire population.In addition to lending money the people have also given freely.   The grand total&apos; -of the gifts from the people of Canada for war purposes is estimated at -$90,000,000, or about -Sll per head, .Labour Troubles : Government and Strike Menace. According to statements made by the representatives of the- employees and members of the Canada Railway War Board, who have been in joint session at Montreal, the express lines of communication throughout Canada will hereinafter be practically guaranteed against the menace of railway labour troubles.It is expected that as a result of the conference a Board of Railway Labour Commissioners will be appointed immediately.&quot; The Board will comprise an -equal number of employees&apos; representatives and members of the Railway War Board, representing the employers. This body will not only interpret and administer the McAdoo award, which all the railways in Canada and their employees have accepted, but will also deal with all railway labour disputes arising in Canada during the period of the war.The possibility of strikes is thus made more remote by this special board of experienced men dealing promptly and expertly with any differences which may arise.Strike of Postmen. The postal employees in the Western cities have returned to work, and deliveries of the mail have been resumed in the.various centres affected, by the recent strike. .Hy a vote of 314 to 47 the men&apos;s committee decided to accept the last proposition made by the Minister of Labour (Mr. T. W. Crothers). By this decision it was agreed that increased wages be granted, and that the Civil Service Commission would immediately open an investigation into the grievances of the men.Canadians in the United States. Steps are to be taken immediately to bring into operation the treaty ratified between Great Britain and the United States, which provides for the compulsory military service of Canadians and other British subjects residing in the United States.For the present the treaty refers to British subjects, including Canadians, between the ages of 21 and -30, domiciled in the United States, who have not declared their intention of becoming naturalized citizens of the United States. These must all return to their own country before the end of September.In trying to estimate the number of Canadians thus affected, a Washington despatch places them at 60,000, but it is believed in well-informed circles at Ottawa that 100,0U0 is nearer the figure.United States Harvesters. Under the direction of the United States employment service, thousands of wheat harvesters are preparing to cross the border into Western Canada, and if the weather conditions are favourable, the vanguard of the army will in two or three weeks be helping to gather in the crops on Canadian farms.The Deputy Minister of the Interior has been to Washington to make final arrangements for the transfer of the huge harvesting army to Canada, and- is now at Kansas City in connection with the matter. The harvesters are -all skilled farm workers, and the help is greatly appreciated, owing to the shortage of labour caused by the war.Financing the Wheat Crop. it. is announced in&apos;Ottawa that as a result of a conference between the representatives of grain, milling and banking interests and the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White), the latter will immediately undertake negotiations with the Imperial authorities and the Bankers&apos; Association with a view to financing the movement of this year&apos;s Canadian crop.Great War Veterans&apos;. Association. The Dominion Convention of the Great War Veterans&apos; Association, which has a membership of over 25,000, debated for some time in conference at Toronto the decision to limit membership to men who had seen
service in England or France or equivalent service in the Navy. Owing to the Winnipeg and Ottawa delegates taking the view that they were persistently voted down by the predominance of the voting power of Ontario, these delegates walked out of the Convention, hut the split was ultimately adjtrsted.The Convention finally revised the constitution of the Association. In future membership will comprise any man of good character who has seen active service in the Great War with the forces of the Allied armies on one of the belligerent fronts, or in England, or equivalent service with the forces of the Allied navies, and who are still in service or retired in honourable discharge; provided, however, that in the case of the man wbo has seen active service in England and who has failed to reach a belligerent front, he shall first show to the satisfaction of the branch of which he proposes to become a member that such failure to reach a belligerent front was through no fault of his own.Amongst the accepted proposals of the Ottawa and Winnipeg men was one that no resolution of a political nature should be introduced this j-ear.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Commonwealth War Effort (vide also Report No. 75). The Minister for &quot;Defence (Senator Pearce), speaking in Sydney on August 1st, said that the number of Australian soldiers embarked was 321,000, which was more than the whole Empire had sent to the South African War ; 70,160 had returned and 53,138 had been discharged. The articles used in equipment 31,250,000 ; flannel totalled 2.2,000,000 yards ; practically the whole of the 4,125,000 yards of khaki cloth used was made in Australia. The Department had purchased 39,000 horses for overseas service, and had also supplied 95,000 horses to the British and Indian Governments. The Australian Government had supplied the whole of the ammunition for the South-West African Campaign, and also all ammunition and explosives for the New Zealand troops.Allied Poicers and Pacific Islands. According to a cable to The Times (London), the Acting Prime Minister (Mr! Watt) referred to the Pacific Islands in a speech in the Protestant Hall, Sydney, and stated that : &quot; Any man in Australia to-day who knowingly would hand back the possession of these islands is an unworthy trustee of the heritage of Australia. Whether they pass into the possession of a neutral or Allied or friendly Power I do not care, but if we pass them back to Germany we shall lay -up a legacy of trouble for our children and their children for many j-ears to come.&quot;Pacifism and lack of unity. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), speaking on August 1st, declared that some forces of disloyalty were based on a mistaken idea of the gravity of the national situation to-day, but sometimes there was pacifist agitation which to his mincl was as treacherous as deliberate disloyalty or revolution. The Government hoped by attacking those influences to exercise a good effect on the man-power problem, which was as urgent to-day as at any time in the history of the war.Mr. Watt, in a later stage of his remarks, said: &quot; Should not the unique sacrifices of Australia&apos;s sons at the war placard the lesson of unity at the outset ? We were fighting for our freedom and existence, we were a divided house with the war fervour perceptibly waning. Profiting by this conviction, a class of men had sprung up who were seeking -to divide the people further by unwise counsels. Beside the pacifists by conviction or war weariness was the pacifist who cloaked treachery to the nation. The Ministry had determined to stop this militant pacifist. A loose rein, perhaps too loose, had been given to many men in Sydney and Melbourne and Brisbane,.who were doing more harm to the national cause than all the other forces in Australia. Thus far should those men go, and no further. Despite concession after concession, sometimes against their better judgment, they had got little reciprocation from the forces against continuing the war. The rank and file of that party in Parliament was lending no aid. Von Luclendorff had given the answer to the cry for peace by negotiation.&quot;A &quot; King&apos;s Men &quot; movement, having as its object the combatting &quot;of tendencies which are likely-to sap the Einpire&apos;s war energies through disloyal propaganda, has been successfully inaugurated at a crowded meeting held.in Sydney Town Hall.
Recruiting Efforts. The Minister for Recruiting (Mr. Orchard) has issued a stirring war anniversary appeal to eligibles, pointing out that 400,000 Australians had left * the shores of the Commonwealth to fight for humanity, freedom-and democracy. Many had made the supreme sacrifice ; many had fought since the immortal days of &quot; Anzac Cove &quot; ; many had been wounded several times, but were still fighting because the need was so great, and reinforcements few, while eligibles remain in Australia snug and sound, enjoying all the privileges the others are lightingfor. -      ;      / - r/&quot; -Members of both Victorian State Houses of Parliament have arranged to par-ticipale in a recruiting campaign between August 22nd and 31st, prior to the launching of the- voluntaiy ballot scheme.War-time Prohibition. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), replying in Sydney to a deputation of women who presented a resolution, carried at a meeting, favouring war-time prohibition, said he had received many expressions of opinion on the subject, and would receive more deputations shortly in Melbourne. If they could show the Federal Government that it was a war measure and not a great National Reform within the,purview of the States he would consider it, but if not, they must go. to the State Premiers. That was the way Canada and the United States had dealt with this subject. Mr. Watt added that he did not think the Federal Parliament would stand for war-time prohibition.&quot;Strength of Empire&apos;&apos;&apos; Movement. During the week ending July 27th, 250 meetings were - held throughout Victoria by the &quot; Strength of Empire &quot; movement. Resolutions were passed favouring war-time prohibition, and adequate measures to deal with the social.evil.Prohibition of German Language. The Federal Cabinet have decided to issue a War Precautions Regulation prohibiting the speaking of the German tongue in public places, but this is not to apply to places of public worship or to teaching in approved schools.Dependants in U-nited Kingdom. The-Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has announced that.from Aiigust 1st, 1918, separation allowances are payable in the United Kingdom to dependants of the A.I.F. resident there.SOUTH AFRICA.General Botha on the War, Internal Troubles, Vvool Clip, &amp;c. The Prime Minister (General Botha), in an important address to his constituents some days ago, declared that there had never been, and never would be, a Premier of South Africa who would have to go through deeper water or whose motives had ever been more misunderstood. A great deal of difficulty, continued General Botha, was being created in So nth Africa, and various grievances were being manufactured, even among women and children, by people throughout the country, who were making all sorts of insinuations. In this connection General Botha referred to the wool question, and declared that the attitude of a certain section had been such that it made one nervous to try to do anything for South Africa. He appealed to his hearers not to allow politics to interfere with business. He never hesitated to tell people, he said, that the war was going to be fought to a final issue, the issue being that the Germans should lose. The war was not- between Great Britain and Germany ; it was a war in which&quot; the liberty cf South Africa was also involved. The Premier pointed out that,.notwithstanding the fact that Russia and Rumania had dropped out, the Allies were so strong to-day that they could take the offensive with good results. General Botha then expressed his gratification at the part America had taken in the war. &quot;America,&quot; he said, &quot;is a democratic country, a country of republicans, but it has been impossible for America, realising that its own liberty too is at stake, to keep out of the war.&quot;General Botha recalled how well he remembered the discussions which he had had with the late ex-President Kruger in the past, and. it was still cpaite fresh in his mind how above all President Kruger and General Joubert preferred to stand under their own flag, but if they could not, they far preferred the British flag to the German or any other flag.6273-la . B
It was South Africa&apos;s duty, General Botha continued, to show the world to-day that they could live peacefully together in South Africa, Englishmen and Boers were to-clay fighting side by side in France for the great ideal to which he had referred, and Briton and Boer were buried together under the soil of France, having given their lives for the liberty of the world. Let South Africa show that their efforts were appreciated, and that their sacrifices had not been in vain.General Botha said that he could not approve of what Great Britain had done to the Transvaal and the Orange Free State in the Boer War, but since South Africa had been given its constitution, nobody could say that anything had been clone by Great Britain against the interests, of South Africa. The Premier referred to the many people who had not fought for the South African Republics, and who to-day were trying to stir up the people to establish a Republic. He assured his hearers that a Republic could not be established in South Africa under existing circumstances without tremendous bloodshed. General Botha then made further reference to the internal troubles of South Africa. He said that he fully accepted General Hertzog&apos;s statement that the Nationalists had had nothing to do with the troubles. General Hertzog, however, acknowledged in Parliament that certain secret organising was going on, and that commandoes were being formed, &amp;c. General Hertzog had travelled in the High Veld, where there had been no rebellion, warning the people &quot;against rebellion. General Botha declared that he would have been better pleased if General Hertzog had clone this in the parts where rebellion had been rife. While issuing his warnings, General Hertzog also ridiculed the Government for taking steps against rebellion. In this connection, the Premier stated that on his arrival in Pretoria on June 28th he received information of such a nature that he had to send 500 mounted men to Germiston, as he had heard that certain troubles were to take place the following day. They had all heard of the danger of a general strike among white men and natives, but when the Government took steps to send armed men to certain localities the Government was ridiculed. &quot; What would have been the position,&quot; asked General Botha, &quot;if 300,000 natives on the Rand had struck? &quot; He expressed his gratitude for the warnings which he had received, and for the&apos;attitude of the mine owners in respect of the threatened strike of whites and natives.In reply to a question concerning the wool clip, General Botha impressed upon his audience the dependence of South Africa upon the British Fleet for the carriage of South African wool.   He stated that if the farmers were unanimous that the Government should make further representations to the Imperial Government for the . purchase of the wool clip, the request could be complied with.Campaign in Free State Province. The forthcoming campaign of five Cabinet Ministers in the Orange Free State Province (vide Report No. 7-9) continues to excite considerable attention. A Renter message says that it is generally affirmed that it is to be carried on in the Allied interests and must be above mere party manoeuvre.The Cape Times in a leading article emphasises the fact that the Nationalists have, firstly, been falsely representing that Great Britain entered the war for purely commercial purposes, and that the responsibility for the war lies as much with the Allies as with Germany, and, secondly, that they have been engineering the belief that German arms will ultimately prevail. The Cape Times adds.: &quot; We believe the publication and extensive circulation of the Lichnowsky memorandum has done much to bring about enlightenment wdth regard to the causes and origin of the war, even among those who have hitherto lent the most willing ear to the pestilent counsels of enemy agents in our midst. Again, the defeat of the German offensive and Americans important part in it give an answer to the question &apos; Who will win the war ? &apos; Consequently, we look forward hopefully to the results of the Ministerial Mission to the Free State.&quot;Immigration after the War.-The.Minister of Mines and Education (Mr. Malan), speaking at Vryheicl last week, made an important reference to immigration-after the war. According to a cable appearing in the London Times, Mr. Malan is reported to have said : &quot; South Africa had been better advertised than any other part of the world. Through the Boer War, through the noble part that the young men were taking in
the present war, it had received a great advertisement, and when the war was over a great stream of immigration would come into the country.&quot;Where was the man, where was the politician or statesman, who was going to stand and try to sweep away a stream of that kind ? It could not he done. lie was not afraid that the South African people would he swamped &quot;by the stream.&quot;Proposed Interchange with Australia. Captain A. C. Carmichael, ex-Minister of Education in New South Wales, has arrived in Capetown from Pretoria and Durban,. where, it is understood, he submitted a proposal addressed to the South African and Australian Governments with a view to stimulating recruiting.-in both countries and bringing the Dominions into closer touch by the exchanging of ideas. Captain Carmichael advocates a permanent system of exchanges of representative men covering-political, commercial, farming, and journalistic interests.In connection with the above it is to be noted that the Acting Prime Minister of Australia (Mr. Watt) has stated that he asked Captain Carmichael whether General Botha was agreeable to his proposal&apos; for an interchange of recruiting speakers with South Africa. The reply received was that the Ministry of the Union of South Africa was strongly sympathetic but that the suggestion was impracticable at present.South-West Africa as a political Factor. The German view of the importance of the return of South-West Africa to Germany in its bearing upon the political situation in the Union is well illustrated in an article by a &quot;former German Colonial Secretary, Herr von Lindequist, which appeared recently in the Tdgliche Rundschau. The writer observes : &quot;For the position of power of our chief enemy, England, in South Africa, it-is a matter of decisive importance whether South-West Africa comes under English sovereignty or not. With this question stands or falls General Botha, the chief pillar of Great Britain in the Union, and his evil spirit, General Smuts.&quot;Herr von Lindequist then proceeds to state that the rebel movement in South Africa is increasing in strength under the influence of German victories on the Western front, and he declares : &quot; Even if Botha once more maintains his position by force, he will certainly fall with the evacuation of German South-West Africa, and a Nationalist Afrikander Ministry will take the place of the English Botha. That means for England the loss of her position of power at the Cape ; for German South-West Africa it means a good neighbour; and for Germany it means a well-wisher with whom to bargain in all South African questions. If, on the other hand, German South-West Africa were to become English, that would confirm the accuracy of the policy of Botha and Smuts, and their position and the power of the English party, whose tools they are, would be so greatly strengthened that, even a German Central Africa would be imperilled.&quot;INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)C0NST]TUTI0jStAL REFORM.&apos;*Views of Heads of Provinces. The Viceroy of India has reported that the &apos;Governor of Bengal and the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces are favourable to the scheme of Constitutional Reform, while the Lieutenant-Governors of the United Provinces and the Punjab have stated that thej&apos; can work the scheme. The Governor of Bombay announces that he is satisfied with the way in which matters are going in connection with the Report.Views of Chiefs. The Secretary of State for India has received, in connection with the Report on Constitutional Reforms, appreciative telegrams from the Maharaja* (See also Appendix to this Report.
of Bikaner, tlie Maharaja Seine!ia of Gwalior, and the Maharaja Jam Salieh of Nawanagar. The Maharaja of Patiaia has already publicly expressed himself in favour of the Report.Views of the Press and Indian Politicians. In Madras, which is the stronghold of the Home Rule agitation, the organs of the advanced Indian party such as the Hindu, New India (Mrs. Besant), Indian Patriot, and the Swadesa Mitran (the leading Tamil organ), are all hostile ; while Justice (the non-Brahmin organ edited by Dr. Hair) deplores the refusal to grant communal representation. The Madras Mail, the chief European paper, regards the changes as unnecessary, and urges the Europeans to demand, representation as a community.In Bombay, the Bombay Chronicle and certain Indian papers, including -Tilalcs orgau, the Kesari, are hostile. In conjunction with the extremists in Madras, those in Bombay press for the Joint Congress and Moslem League scheme.The Times of India welcomes the scheme, as also do the Indian owned papers, the Advocate of India, and Daily Gazette (Karachi).The Governor of Bombay informs the Secretary of State that reports in the Press, do not indicate the true state of public opinion in Bombay, and this view is confirmed by the Viceroy, who indicates that private advice from Bombay records great and solid satisfaction with the tone and substance of the Report.In Calcutta, the European papers adopted a critical tone at the outset, but on July 27th the Viceroy stated that -the attitude of the English papers had become distinctly more favourable. Moderate Indian politicians in Bengal have given the proposals important support (vide Report Ho. 79).In the United Provinces favourable views of the Report have been taken by the Pioneer, Daily Telegraph, and the Allahabad Leader.   The Viceroy states that the-United Provinces hnve given a better reception  to  the Report than any other Province.Favourable views regarding the Reform Scheme have been expressed by individuals such as Mr. Sastri, who succeeded Mr. Gokhale in his work on the &quot; Servants of India Society,&quot; Sir G. Chitna^is, of the Central Provinces, Sir Fazulbhoy Karimbhoy, and other prominent members of the Bombay Legislative Council.As to the special meeting of the National Congress at Bombay this month (vide Report No. 79), the Extremists are making great efforts to dominate the meeting. The Viceroy of India reports that the Bombay moderates have announced their intention of abstaining from the August Session, and that while the Extremists are being isolated, the Moderates are coming out very boldly in support of the proposals. The Viceroy expresses the belief that the. Extremists will not carry public opinion wdth them, and states that becamse they are the most vocal and truculent they must not be regarded as the most influential section of the public. The Viceroy considers that the Home Rulers and Extremists are striving, by preserving an atmosphere of extreme hostility, to extort greater concessions. The Secretary of State for Incl ia, therefore, submits that the proceedings at Bombay will not be an indication of the attitude of Indian political opinion as a whole.Sedition.liepbrt on Sedition. Mr. Justice Rowlatt&apos;s Committee on sedition contains a review of the revolutionary conspiracies in India, the association of the Bengal seditionists with German plots, the abortive efforts to ship arms to conspirators, and the plans for risings which were defeated by special measures and the loyalty of the mass of the people.The Report concludes by detailing the recommendations of the Committee as to the legislation and procedure necessary to enable the Government to deal with conspiracy after the expiry of the Defence of India Act.
APPENDIXtoWestern and General Report No. 80.  Part I.INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.&quot;By Sir Satyendra Sinha, k.c.Past Constitutional Changes. The foundations of the present system of Indian government were laid by Pitt in his famous Act of 1784, which created whatsis known as &quot;the Double Government System.&quot; The administration of India was carried on as before by the East India Company through the Court of Directors, but the real authority in important matters was vested by that Act in a Board of Control whose powers were virtually exercised by its President-a member of the British Cabinet, who had the light to appoint the Governor-General, the Presidency Governors, and the Commander-in-Chief. Thus the British Ministry was made virtually responsible for the policjr pursued- in India and became accountable for the same to Parliament. The Company&apos;s Charter was renewed every 20 years, and each occasion was preceded by an elaborate Parliamentary enquiry into its administration.The Double Government System was altered without difficulty into direct Single Government by the Crown in 1858. A Secretary of State for. India took the place of the President of the Board of Control, and was given the assistance of a Council which, as regards Indian experience, took the place of the Court of Directors. Thus for the first time the great continent of India became visibly incorporated into the British Empire.Since .1858 many changes have been made in the system of Indian administration by Parliamentary Statutes of 1861, 1892 and 1909, but the main structure remains unaltered.   These changes may generally be ascribed to two causes : (1) The necessity of decentralising the Government owing to the ever growing-mass of business and increasing duties of administration &quot;no siugle administration could support the Atlantean load.&quot;f(2) The policy of giving the Indian people a larger voice and a larger share in the management of Indian affairs. The instincts of Englishmen were in favour of it, and j)rudence and policy alike made it necessary.The first has led to the modern or Cabinet system of Departments of Government presided over by members of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council, now six in number. It has also led to the Government of India keeping in its own hands and directly administering certain Departments of State such as the Army, relations with Foreign States, Public Debt, Tariffs, Railways, Posts and Telegraphs, &amp;c, leaving the general internal administration of the country to the local or Provincial Govern-ments while retaining extensive powers of supervision, direction and control. The second has led to what is perhaj)s the most important change by creating both for the Central Government and the Local Governments the Legislative Councils whose numbers and functions have been continuously increased. From a body consisting of only four high officials of the State, the Legislative Council of India has grown to an assembly of 66, 30 of them being non-officials who are either returned by specified electorates (Muhainmadans and landowners), or are otherwise the representatives of specified classes. The Provincial Legislative Councils have also grown so that there is now under Lord Morley&apos;s Indian Councils Act of 1909 the maximum of&quot; 50 non-official members for the larger provinces and of 30 for the smaller ones. From the first, the policy followed has been to make the Legislative Councils more and more representative of the people, and the principle of election was admitted in* This Appendix consists of the main portion of a confidential paper read before members of the Lords and Commons constituting the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, at a private meeting held at the Houses of Parliament on July 31st, 1918, when Mr. Austen Chamberlain occupied the Chair.

a modified form in 1892, so far as Provincial Councils only were concerned, and more completely in 1909 with reference to both the supreme and Provincial Councils by Lord Morley&apos;s Indian Councils Act of that year. The functions of these councils were, to start with, purely legislative, but now include the right to put questions and the right to move resolutions and to take divisions in the House on matters of public interest, including the detailed provisions of the Budget. But the Legislative Councils are not Parliaments, they cannot turn out the executive, they cannot stop supplies and the3&apos; cannot enforce the resolutions they may pass. In the&apos; Governor-Generahs Legislative Council there is an official majority, and any law desired by the Executive Government can be passed with the assistance of that majority. In the Provincial Councils there is a non-official (but not an elected) majority, including representatives of British trade and commerce, so that in the face of a united non-official opposition (a contingency, however, hardly likely to arise), the Government has to rely on the power of veto to prevent undesirable legislation or to get legislation passed by the Governor-Genei-ahs Legislative Council with its solid official block. There is a further check, inasmuch as every Act of the Local Council requires for its validity the assent of the Governor-General and every Act of both the Governor-General&apos;s Council aud the Provincial Council requires the sanction of the Secretary of State.0Proposed Constitutional Reforms : General. We are now in a position to discuss the changes proposed by Mr, Montagu and Lord Chelmsford and to consider in what respects, if any, there has been a departure from the accepted principles which have hitherto decided British policy with regard to India, namely, the necessity of decentralisation, financial and administrative, and secondly the wisdom of giving the people a real and a growing share in the work of administration. Sufficient attention has not been drawn in the Press to the fact that the recommendations do not relate to (1) Burma, (2) the ISiorth-West Frontier Province, (3) Baluchistan, (4) smaller tracts like- Delhi, Coorg, Ajmere-Merwara, and (5) large backward areas in the larger provinces (Sch. D. to Act, 1874), which will continue to be administered by the Heads of the Local Governments as before.This takes away a good deal of the criticism about the unsuitableness of the changes proposed for the population concerned.Two of the important changes recommended have received but little notice and less criticism, namely : (1) that as regards local self-government complete popular control should be established in the urban and rural boards from village unions upwards, and(2) that as regards the higher public services a system of recruitment in India should be established in addition to recruitment in England where such exists percentages of recruitment in India with a definite rate of increase being fixed. These have been long demanded by Indian public opinion; successive Commissions, like the Decentralisation Commission of 1907-08 and the Public Services Commission, 1912-13, have substantially recommended their acceptance, and the silent approval of all concerned, so far as this portion of the Report is concerned, makes it unnecessary for me to dilate upon either the justice or the necessity for these pi articular reforms.Coming now to the constitutional changes, strictly so-called, we may classify them under three heads :  (1) The control of Parliament and the Secretary of State. (2) The Central Government of India, (3) The Provincial Governments.As regards (1) the object of the Report is to provide for a more continuous and more effective consideration of Indian questions by the British Parliament than is the case&apos; at present. The proposal for placing the salary of the secretar^ of State for India on the Home Estimates and appointing a permanent Select Committee for Indian Affairs, and a Parliamentary Committee every 10 or 12 years for the examination of the Indian situation, have all this object in view. On the other hand it is proposed to make the control of Parliament and the Secretary of State over the Indian Administration less rigorous in details, in defined* I am indebted tor a great deal of the above to Sir T. Holdemess&apos;s admirable book &quot;The Peoples and Problems of India.&quot;
* In substance the change amounts to little more than so separating the present, official and non-official blocks as to avoid the sense of irritation due to a solid official majority. 6273-la Dfinancial and administrative spheres. As will be pointed out later on, it is proposed to transfer the control of the administration of purely local matters like education, sanitation, agriculture, &amp;c, to the representative assemblies of the people of the provinces concerned, and in so far as this will be done Parliament must necessarily divest itself of direct responsibility for such matters. As regards the Government of India, all the Departments of Imperial concern, e.g., Defence, Railways, Posts and Telegraphs, Tariffs, &amp;c, will remain in its hands, and it is also to continue to remain responsible for law and order throughout the Indian Empire. So far as these vital matters are concerned the Government of India is to remain ultimately responsible to the Secretary of State and to Parliament; and, in so far as this will be the case, its Executive Government, composed of the Viceroy and the Members &apos;of his Executive Council, will exercise full powers for carrying on the. Government according to its own -initiative and its own line of policy. But the Government of India will be liberalized in three different directions. In the first place, in the Executive Council of the Viceroy at least one inore Indian member will be appointed. In the second place, subject as above, the Provincial Governments will be granted more financial and administrative independence. Lastly, the Legislative Council of the Government of India will be still further enlarged so as to make its consultative and advisory powers still more representative. The elected element in the Assembly will be greatly strengthened, and, out of the proposed number of 100 members, no more than one-third is to be nominated, and one-third of that third is to be official. There will, however, be a second House of 50 members, styled the Council of State, with an official majority for balancing and checking the action of the Legislative Assembly, and for carrying out any important legislative measures which might fail to pass through the Legislative Assembly.&quot;5Local Government. It is, however, in the sphere of the Local Governments that the most important changes are proposed. &quot; The Provinces are the domain in which &apos;&apos; the earlier steps towards the progressive realisation of responsible government &quot; should be taken,&quot; as the Report puts it. As we Inave already seen, there will be greater financial independence, and the Provincial Governments will have independent sources of income, a privilege which will be a great incentive for the development and. the husbanding of their special resources. They will have powers of taxation under proper safeguards, and greater administrative independence, the scope of which will, have to be determined by the Government of India and the Local Governments concerned. The Legislative Assemblies are to be still further enlarged with a substantial elected majority. The franchise is to be broadened, and, as far as practicable, direct voting on a territorial basis is to be adopted, although there must still be special electorates for important minorities, such as the Muhammaclans and the Sikhs. As in these Assemblies the elected members will be greatly in the majority, provision has been made for the appointment of a Grand Committee for the carrying out of such legislation as may not pass through the Assembly, and which the head of the Government might consider to be necessary and for which he would be prepared to grant a certificate. This is an additional safeguard besides those already described.Provincial Administration: Reserved and Transferred Subjects. We now come to what is undoubtedly the most important innovation in the scheme of proposed reforms. It is proposed to divide the subject-matter of the departments of provincial administration into two classes, viz., reserved subjects and transferred subjects. The reserved subjects are those connected with the maintenance of law and order or matters vitally affecting the interests of the masses not yet adequately represented. These are to remain under the control of the Executive as at present, subject, as already stated, to supervision by the Central Government and Parliament. The &quot; transferred &quot; subjects are those which will be made over to the control of the Popular Legislative Assemblies. They would naturally&apos; include departments like Local Self-Government, Education, and Sanitation, which will give opportunity and scope for local knowledge and social service and those for which Indians have shown special interest and which stand in special need of co-operation with the people. As the demarcation between the transferred and the reserved subjects cannot be the same for each Province, it. is proposed that a Special Committee be appointed at once to discuss the matter with the Government and people of each Province.   Another
Committee is also to be appointed to make an electoral survey of the whole- country for it is clear that the franchise system that would secure fair representation in one province might not secure it in another. The Report justly lays great stress on the importance of a genuine attempt being made to secure a real representation of the interests of all classes in the popular assemblies as far as the circumstances of the country will permit, and great stress is also laid on the necessity of so framing the electoral machinery that the members sitting on the popular assembly will clearly realise their responsibility to their own electorates.As regards the Executive administration of the province, it is proposed that the Government should be a composite body. One element in it will be the Governor and an Executive Council of two members, a European of long official experience and a selected Indian. This element will have charge of the reserved subjects. Another element will consist of the Governor and one or more members according to the importance of the transferred subjects, and they are to be chosen by the Governor from the elected members of the Legislative Council. These would be known as Ministers and would be Members of the Executive Government eq-ually with Members of the Executive Council. The Ministers will be chosen on the ground that they command the confidence of the majority of the Legislative Council. Though the Government would deliberate generally as a whole, i.e., both Members and Ministers, decisions on reserved subjects and on provincial budget supply for them will rest with the Governor and his Executive Council; decisions on reserved subjects and the supply for them with the Governor and the Ministers.It will be seen from the above that it is proposed at once to give some definite powers and some measure of responsibility, however small, to the people through their representatives and to go on systematically as conditions permit by regular and carefully considered stages to complete responsibility in provincial administration.Summary of Forward Steps. Now let me summarise wdiat are the principal directions in which it is proposed by these reforms to make a forward advance. They are as follows :  (1) The further Indianisation of the Services by the removal in practice (in theory it was laid clown most broadly as long ago as 1S33) of all racial discpualifications for entering the highest offices in the services of the State.(2) The removal of all control from within, in the sphere of local self-government,so far as such external control is still exercised. (3) The decentralisation of responsibility and power with the object of grantinggreater autonomy to Provincial Governments in their relations with theGovernment of India, and to the Government of India itself in its relationswith the Home Government. (4) The amplification and development of the constitution of the LegislativeAssemblies for the Supreme and Provincial Governments in order to make them more truly representative. (5) The transfer of the responsibility for the administration of certain departments of local interest in the Provinces from the Executive to the electedLegislature, thus sowing the seeds of responsible government in India andthe provision Gf  machinery for periodic examination of the politicalsituation.From what I have said above I hope I have been able to make it quite clear that the Reforms, as far as it is XDroposed to travel along the first four lines of advance, are a direct outcome of the constitutional changes introduced into India during the last half century, and more notably those associated with the names of Lords Morley and Minto. The most momentous advance in the Indianisation of the Services was a-eally made when, after a strenuous struggle, Lord Morley succeeded in appointing an Indian Member to the Viceroy&apos;s Council and two Indian Members to the Council of the Secretary of State for India. As to the second, the principle was laid clown as long ago as 1883 by Lord Ripon, and though slow at first, considerable progress has already been achieved. The principle of granting autonomy to the Provinces was accepted by the Decentralisation Committee and strenuously advocated in the famous Despatch of Lord Harclinge in 1911. Thevprinciple of election and the necessity of its extension in the legislatures was most authoritatively and emphatically recognised in the Morley-Minto reforms. But more valuable than all this was the introduction by Lord Morley of truly liberal and democratic principles in the practical solution of Tndian constitutional problems.   And I  take this  opportunity of  once again.
acknowledging the great debt of gratitude that India owes to her two previous Viceroys, Lords Minto and Harclinge, and to Lord Morley, that great liberal philosopher Avhom India will- always remember as the greatest English statesman who ever had direct parliamentary responsibility in guiding the destinies of India./&apos;As to the fifth and last line of- progress indicated&quot; above, namely, the proposal to hand over certain departments of the provincial administration to popular control, it cannot be denied that this is the first express introduction into the Indian scheme of government of the great principle of responsibility to the people themselves.&apos; The obvious justification of this proposal is found in the terms of the announcement of the 20th August last, that &quot;the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with which the &quot; Government of India are in complete accord is that of the increasing association of &quot; Indians in every branch of administration and the gradual -development of self-&quot; governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible &quot; government in India as an integral part of the British Empire. Thej- have decided &quot; that substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as possible.&quot;Alternative Schemes&apos;. I would ask those who accept the above declaration of policy and yet would reject the proposed reforms to consider what other alternative schemes are possible as &quot; a substantial step in the near future in the direction of responsible government &quot; for India. To stop short at the first four changes would only mean a very small extension of lines of policy advocated long before the &quot;war, and much longer before the last declaration. To stop there will mean a refusal to fulfil the pledge contained in the August announcement. It is necessary, therefore, to consider what other alternative schemes have so far been suggested on the lines of the present declaration. As far as I am aware there are only two other alternative schemes in the field. The first is the one known as the Congress Moslem League Scheme, and numerous variations thereof, the shortcomings of which have been fully discussed in the Report itself and which it would not accept because it transferred power to the legislature without corresponding responsibility. Quite recently a suggestion has been put forward in certain quarters that one particular province of India, or a smaller area, should be selected for the experiment of complete responsible government, the avowed object being thereby to demonstrate its unsuitability for India. For myself I am not prepared to admit that the confident anticipations of these critics would be realised if the experiment were tried, but I would not, for obvious reasons, recommend that one particular portion of India should be differently treated from the rest, or that such a crude scheme, as Sir Andrew Eraser, formerly a distinguished Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, styles it, should be rashly put into operation without adequate preparation.Goal of British Rule.  But the truth is that such criticism as has been directed against the Report really comes from those who do not sincerely accept the policy of the last announcement. They oppose&quot; the Montagu-Chelmsford scheme not because of any reasonable apprehension that the forces of -disruption and disintegration would overtake the body politic if those proposals were to be carried out, but. because they hold a fundamentally different view of the goal of British rule in India. According to them the irresponsible and absolute system of government is the only form of administration which is suitable for Asiatic peoples and government with the co-operation and sanction of the people, based on English or western models, must for ever remain be*ond the reach of such peoples. It is this short-sighted and immoral point of view which has received just castigation at the hands of my valued friend H.H. the Aga Khan in his extremely incisive and statesmanlike study of the present day Indian problem. Speaking of - the pretentious of this school he says: &quot; This imperialistic school entertains a &quot; subconscious feeling that the loyal Asiatic can be happy only when his &quot; racial limitations are accepted beyond discussion. It regards his loyalty as &quot; nearer that of a faithful and noble dog to a. just and noble master than to that &quot; of an equal partner in sacrifice, with the same flesh and blood.&quot; Then he goes on to describe the lofty ideals of the second school the school of Macaulay, Malcolm, Muuro, and Elphinstone, of Ripon. of Minto and Morley, and I would add that of Montagu and Chelmsford. &quot;This school,&quot; says the Aga Khan, &quot;has a nobler and ultimately more beneficial idea for England in her relation to India. It is to raise the hundreds of millions of Asiatics that the will of Providence and the play of historic forces have brought within the orbit of Great Britain to a self-respecting independent position within her dominions.   Under this
noble ideal the British Empire of the future can confer full self-government on the peoples she has trained for the responsibility, and then take to her bosom as the greatest and best-beloved of her foster children the free myriads of India.&quot; In this connection it is necessary to point out that although there will be few responsible publicists either here or in India who would have the hardihood at the present day to champion the plantation &quot;policy in its nakedness, yet there are not a few who maintain that although it may be the mission of England to elevate India and work for her political and economic regeneration, our task can be best performed by the methods of benevolent and patriarchal despiotism than by the adoption of the democratic forms of government which are only congenial to the western soil. Or, in other words, while professing to accept the ideals of the liberal school, they.desire to postpone their accomplishment indefinitely by covering a doubtful position with comprehensive legal phrases like &quot;trustee&quot; and &quot;guardian,&quot; phrases of which I could expose the hollowness if I were willing to revive bitter memories: But a century and a half of the most carefully devised and unselfishly administered bureau-cratic administration has conclusively proved that power without real responsibility is as much a failure in the East as in the West, and has demonstrated the truth of the statement of John Stuart Mill that self-government is ultimately far better than government by the most well-intentioned external authority. It is. because &quot; the best Indian thought,&quot; to quote the words of His Highness the Aga Khan again, &quot; is convinced that there is no more time to lose, that we cry for a radical change of policy and of rule, a new angle of vision, a final break with government deriving authority wholly from without, and a commencement from the lowest to the highest stage of full co-operation with the people.&quot; It is exactly on similar grounds that in 1915, when I had the honour of presiding over the Indian National Congress, that I urged upon the British Government to make a public declaration of their policy, to proclaim that their ultimate aim was to give India self-government within the Empire, so that the moderate and patriotic sections of the Indian people might unfurl a banner of federal patriotism within the Empire, under which all right-thinking and reasonable-minded. Indians might rally.It is principally the school of politicians&quot; who claim for England &quot; the ownership &quot; of. India a claim openly advanced less than two months ago who asks the question why India required any marked change of system. Taking into consideration the divisions of the people, the illiteracy of the masses, the rivalries of religions and races, why, these trustee owners ask, why should not England continue to rule for an indefinite time her vast Asiatic Dominions with undivided absolute and autocratic authority? And why at an y rate, they ask further, should these questions be raised at a time when the Empire is engaged in a life and death struggle ?I am not content to answer these questions by reminding you of the promises made and pledges given by your leading statesmen of all parties. They are not to be . ignored for a pledge broken is serious in its consequences everywhere and under all circumstances. Nor do I advocate &quot; a marked change of system &quot; as a reward of conspicuous loyalty and meritorious service in the course of this terrific war. It has been well said that &quot; India will not chaffer with the blood of her sons and the tears of her daughters.&quot; No, the reforms would not be worth having if they are to be treated, as bucksheesh or largesse. But one of the inevitable reasons for reform is that in politics there is no standing still you must either go back or move forward. By a noble and consistent policy extending over upwards of a century, you have endowed large sections of the Indian people with western education and. western ideals. You have increasingly associated them in the service of the country, you have endowed your Legislative Councils with the forms and formulas of Parliamentary government. You cannot go back on your plighted troth, and you cannot deny them the priceless boon, the crowning glory, of free and responsible government. But that is not. all. &quot;World forces too large to be restrained have been let loose by the war,&quot; and above all, the war has demonstrated India&apos;s potentialities aud her present limitations. To develop these potentialities, and to get rid of these limitations, you want the whole-hearted co-operation of all her people. Nothing short of free institutions fostered as quickly as. circumstances allow, will enable you to fully utilise the man-power and the material resources of India. The future is too full of grave and constant menace to admit of an3^ further delay, whatever the immediate issue of this war^ might be. My own experience, and all that I have heard from leading British public men during the last two years, convince me that it will be unwise to wait till the termination of the war for the working out of the Indian problem in all its complex details.
