SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. .91.PART I. BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The course of action proposed to the Dominion Governments in order to remove the anomalies connected with the Gallipoli decorations has already been approved in principle by New Zealand.Canada.The new Order-iu-Counci] for the prevention of strikes has met with considerable criticism in Labonr circles, though it has also received some support. The Govern-ment commenced a prosecution of the railway strikers under their newly accpuired powers, but the settlement of the strike has prevented a comparison being made between the results in Canada and the outcome of similar legislative experiments in other Dominions.The financial items in this Report are of interest as illustrating the. great alteration made by the war in the national responsibilities of the Dominion.The new organisation for discharged soldiers aims apparently at becoming a political force in the Dominion.A ust ra 1.1 a n  C 0 m it on we a lti r.It is oE interest to note that Mr. Hughes is considering the advisability of remaining in England for a further period.The general feeling in the Commonwealth regarding Germai:y;s reply to President Wilson is no doubt being strengthened by the presence in Australia of the French Mission and the vigorous attitude of General Pan, who is meeting with such a cordial reception. The desire to place France in Germany&apos;s pre-war position so far as imports are concerned, and to render all possible assistance towards re-establishing the destroyed industries of our AIR by the supply of raw materials, is indicated as the policy of the Commonwealth Government.      *  ,.;With regard to the compulsory contributions to the War Loan, it is interesting to note that there will be no exemptions for conscientious objectors.The assumption of control of building and construction by the Commonwealth . has already aroused criticism in New South Wales, where it is realised that the regulation will materially affect the powers and policy of the State Government.   (Vide -also Appreciation of Report No. 90.)New Zealand.The position of the Dominion iu connection with the- United States meat supplies provides an illustration of the manner in which Dominion interests may affect foreign
relations. The explanation which has been sent to Mr. Massey as to the difficulties-which led the British Government to secure increased supplies from North America is of interest,, and it should help to meet the expected criticism in the Dominion Parliament.South Africa.The Resolution passed by the Farmers&apos; Conference at Pretoria, and the Union &quot;Government^ telegram on the subject, show that the purchase of part of the seasons-wool clip would be a great help to the wool growers. In the event of action being taken on the lines suggested by the Union Government, it is difficult to see how, in face of this Resolution, the Nationalists could, make political capital out of the transaction.Indications point to the next Parliamentary Session, which is expected to open at the beginning of next year, being one of considerable political importance to South Africa.Apparently General Hertzog is still, trying to exploit the Imperial connection as a means of attacking the Union Government in the Free State Province. His attempt to identify the Imperial War Cabinet with a &quot; Federal Council &quot; may, perhaps,, succeed in misleading some of the backveld farmers. It is satisfactory to observe-that the Nationalist Reader has been obliged, to conduct a strenuous campaign in the endeavour to counteract the influence of the recent Ministerial tour in the Province.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The considerable increases in the monthly figures for recruiting since May are particularly gratifying! The figures of the Second War Roan should also receive attention.H. d&apos;E.October 24th, 1918. -

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Gallipoli Decorations : Proposed removal of Anomalies. The Dominion Govern-ments have been informed that difficulties have arisen as to the issue to the Dominion troops serving in Gallipoli of decorations which cannot be conferred on their British comrades who shared the hardships and clangers. Greater anomalies would, it is mentioned, be involved by the extension of this decoration, as demands for the issue of an indefinite number of further decorations would be irresistible. The Dominion Governments are therefore asked to concur in the recommendations of the Committee appointed by the British Government, who have proposed that the 1914 Star in its present form shall be granted under conditions now approved, but that this Star, with the same riband but bearing an altered date, 1914-15, shall be extended to all those ineligible for the 1914 Star who served in the campaign in a theatre of war prior to 5th August 1915 and to all those who arrived in such a theatre of war on duty prior to that elate. The Army Council will define &quot; theatre of war &quot; in consultation with the Air Board and Admiralty, and will thus include the British Dominion and Indian troops who fought in Gallipoli and who were on the Peninsula ; the First Canadian Division and Cavalry Brigade who fought at Festubert and the second battle of Ypres ; those who fought in German South-West Africa and nearly all the Indian troops who fought in East Africa ; the British Dominion and Indian troops who fought in the defence of Egypt; officers and men of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who served during the first year of war on a ship at sea; and all members of the Flying Services fulfilling the prescribed conditions. It is pointed out by the British Government that the proposed solution would remove entirely the anomaly of troops serving side by side in the same theatre of war not receiving the same reward for their services.Owing to the great importance attached in Australia and. New Zealand to a special decoration for Gallipoli, the Governments of those Dominions have been informed that in the event of the proposal being adopted a special clasp on the war medal for Gallipoli would be given.In reply, the Government of New Zealand have telegraphed their concurrence with the. general principle of the proposal, but they consider it essential that as regards New Zealand troops the date of evacuation of Gallipoii, December 19th, 1915, should be substituted for August 5th, 1915. Amongst the reasons given for this suggestion are that owing to strong criticism in the Dominion of the original proposal, it has been widely published in the Press that all New Zealand troops who served at any time during the operations would be awarded the Star ; and that the application of the date of August 5th, 1915, to troops of the Dominion would exclude those who fought in August and September 1915 on the Peninsula, while it would include the force occupying Samoa where no fighting occurred. The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) places on record that he has always considered that Imperial troops should not be excluded from recognition in connection with services in Gallipoli, and is therefore *yery pleased to observe the proposals now put forward by the British Government.
SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.Canada.Prime Ministers Return. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) has arrived at Ottawa after his holiday and has resumed his official duties.Government and Strikes. The Government decided to take action against the Calgary railway strikers under the new Order-in-Council forbidding strikes and lock-outs for the duration of the war (vide Report No. 90). As a result, five men prominently connected with the strike were summoned for breaches of the Industrial Disputes Act. Senator Gideon Robertson (the representative of Labour in the Dominion Cabinet) proceeded to negotiate with the officials of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the representatives of the Western strikers with a view to effecting an understanding.Meantime, however, five hundred Canadian Pacific employees connected with the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen and Machinists&apos; Helpers went on strike, and the yardmen threatened to take similar action. The men declared that they were striking in. sympathy with the Calgary employees, and in defiance of the recent Order-in-Council.The Calgary strikers at a mass meeting demanded the withdrawal of the Order-in-Council, stating that such a course was necessary if the Government desired industrial harmony. The meeting also endorsed the attitude of the President of the Trades and Labour Congress (Mr. T. Moore) who recently attacked the measure. There appears, however, to be a wide divergence of opinion in labour circles regarding the Order-in-Council. Organised labour in Toronto are said to be strongly opposed to the measure, and are sending protests to the Government demanding.the repeal of the measure. Opposition from organised labour bodies is also reported from other parts of the Dominion. On the other hand, Mr. J. Murdoch, Vice-president of . the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, and one of the best known labour leaders in Canada, wired Senator Gideon Robertson as follows : &quot; Pleased indeed to read the recent Order-in-Council prohibiting strikes for the duration of the war. Under Existing conditions and arrangements organised labour can receive prompt recognition and adjustment.&quot;As to the railway employees of military age -who were on strike, one of the Dominion Ministers (Mr. F. 11. Carvell) announced that if the men persisted in their defiant attitude the machinery would be created for drafting them into the army. However, the necessity for this, or the continuance of the prosecutions, did not arise, as the strike has now been settled.Strikes last Month. According to the Labour Gazette of Canada there were thirty strikes in the Dominion last month which affected 7,511 persons and involved a loss of 103,238 working days.War Expenditure and Debt. During the six months ending September 30th canada&apos;s war expenditure aggregated in excess of $103,000,000 as compared with approximately $87,750,000 for the corresponding period of last year.The net debt of the Dominion at the end of September stood at $1,224,000,000.Dominion Loan Achievements. The Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White),, speaking last w-eek at Vancouver in connection with the ATctory Loan campaign, made the following interesting statement : &quot; Before the war broke out no loan as much as $5,000,000 had ever been floated in Canada, yet I am asking the people of Canada to subscribe $500,000,000, and I am going to get it from a scattered nation of eight million, who have already subscribed $700,000,000 in War Bonds during the past four years.&quot;A Political Association of Returned Soldiers. Another Association of Returned Soldiers called &quot;The Grand Army of Canada&quot; has been launched,at Toronto. A number of the men forming the new body are stated to have belonged to the Great War Veterans&apos; Association, but were dissatisfied with the actions of that body. The new organisation will enter the political field, but will not. accept grants of.money Rom s ^any City or Provincial Governments or from the Federal Authorities.66&apos; 3 ia
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Prime Minister s stay in England. It is understood that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) is considering the advisability of remaining in England in view of the possibility of peace, and in order, in that event, to enable him to deal more effectively with the various post-war problems affecting Australia, including matters of demobilisation, &amp;c. A recent statement of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) indicates that the Federal Cabinet are agreeable to Mr. Hughes remaining in England for the present.Views on Peace Questions. Germany&apos;s acceptance of President Wilson&apos;s peace terms at first aroused great excitement in Melbourne, but the general feeling later was against the cessation of hostilities until Germany is placed in a position which will render her unable to resume effective fighting. Senator Pearce, Minister for Defence, welcomed the news as an encouraging sign, but accepted it with reserve. The Chairman of the French Mission (General Pan) repeated that the Allies must not faR into a trap. The only real solution was to get the Germans on the other side of the Rhine. The feeling that peace was imminent, he said, was not justified. Influential newspapers adopt a cautious tone, and point out that the continuance of gross outrages against the usages of war on sea and land disentitle Germany to anv consideration.France and the Commonwealth. The gathering at Federal Parliament House to do honour to the Members of the French Mission occasioned some notable observations as to the common interests of France and Australia. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in proposing the toast of the French Mission observed : &quot; The interests of France and Australia meet peacefully in the Pacific Ocean, where there are also danger spots called German Colonies.&quot; He continued : &quot;We realise with shame that Australia&apos;s yearly average imports from Germany were three times greater than those from France, but if it is possible now to put France into Germany&quot;s pre-war position, Australia will do so with pleasure and alacrity. Australia will also give France all possible assistance with raw materials, to enable her to rebuild destroyed industries.&quot; Mr. Tudor, Leader of the Opposition, cordially supported the toast, which was honoured with great enthusiasm.,War Loan: Compulsory Subscriptions. The approximate total subscribed up to October 15th for the seventh War Loan is 37,O0O,()O0Z.; further sums are expected. The decision to extend the time for subscriptions till October 28th has been eencrallv welcomed.The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) explaining the Compulsory War Loan Bill, &apos;said that contributors to previous loans would not escape compulsion, unless their contribution was according to their means. There would be no exemption for conscientious objectors, as &quot; there is a limit to immunity granted on ethical considerations.&quot;Control of Construction - Commonwealth and States. The War Precautions regulation preventing the erection of new buildings without the consent of the Federal Treasurer (vide Report No. 90), has caused considerable comment in New South Wales. Ministers of that State have given public expression to the view that the regulation may annul the policy of the State&apos;s Public Works Department.Increase of Postage Rates. The Federal Parliament has passed a Bill increasing the postage of letters, newspapers, and packets, by one halfpenny. -NEW ZEALAND.Meat Supplies from United States : proposed Statement in Dominion Parliament.  The British Government have informed the Dominion Government that, with regard to the proposed statement of the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) to - the Dominion Parliament as to the meat importations into the United Kingdom and the relation of the price paid to the United States to the price paid to Australia and New Zealand, -
the publication of the proceedings of the Imperial War Conference and the Report of the Committee which was discussed there, would be open to grave objection from the point of view of foreign relations. No objection, however, is raised to Mr. Massey stating the nature of the action he took while in the United - Kingdom on behalf of New Zealand producers, and the hope is expressed that he will make clear the difficulties which led the British Government to secure increased supplies of meat from North America.For the last-named purpose a statement of the Food Controller is forwarded. In the course of this statement it is pointed out that the acute shortage of meat, experienced in January and February 1918, which led to the formation of meat queues and accentuated industrial unrest, led to the purchase of large quantities of meat in North America as the only course open for relieving the severe scarcity of civilian supplies. * It is observed that it was possible to obtain seven cargoes of meat from North America in the same time that two would be obtained from Australasia and three from&apos; South America; and. the serious military situation rendered it of vital importance to concentrate all available ships on the Atlantic route for the transport of American troops to France. The result was that during the first six months of. 1918, 64 per cent, of imported civilian meat was derived from North America. As to prices, it is pointed out in this statement that the efforts of the American Food Administration have been directed rather towards the increased production for the sake of the Allies than towards restricting prices, but that Mr. Hoover&apos;s administration has done what it could to control the prices paid to producers, and the profits gained by the meat packers and practically all the increase of price which has taken place, has gone to the farmers. The Allies have been secured identical treatment (as regards price) with the Government and people of the United States, and it is stated, that no action could possibly secure better terms than this. The price of Australasian meat could not affect the price paid to the Americans, and any saving made on the former contributes directly to the reduction of the price to the consumer.In reply the Dominion Prime Minister states that he will explain the position to Parliament without reference to the proceedings at the Imperial &quot;War Conference, though he considers that the decision to make this discussion confidential will have a bad effect, more especially as the recent disclosures regarding the operations of the Meat Trust by the United States Government Commission have increased the dissatisfaction, and will make it more difficult to explain the transactions.SOUTH AFRICA.Farmers&apos; Conference and Wool Clip (vide also Report No. 86). The Union Government have informed the British Government that at the Conference of Wool Growers held at Pretoria on October 16th, the following Resolution was passed by 37 votes to 23, viz. : &quot; That the Government of the Union of South Africa be asked to approach the Imperial Government with a request to purchase such portion of the South African wool clip of the 1918-1919 season as may be registered in a given period, on similar terms and price, basis as were laid &quot;down for the purchase of last season&apos;s clip, viz., 1913-1914 average prices, plus 55 per cent. In view of the fact, however, that during the last five years the South African wool clip has considerably improved in quality, it is suggested that the price be increased to lOd. per pound in the grease for an average combing of 40 per cent, clean yield, and that the Conference is of opinion that as the difference between the Australian and South African wool in London is not so great to-day as in 1913-1914, this increase in price is fully justified. This Conference further recommends that instead of a share in the profits resulting from any sales made by the Imperial Government, an additional 20 per cent, be added to the 55 per cent, and be paid out at the time of purchase in full and final settlement of such purchase. This Conference consisting of delegates from different districts of the Union in favour of another Government scheme, guarantees the registration of 80,000 bales at least and that quantity will doubtless be increased when registration is thrown open.&quot;The Union Ministers, in their telegram upon this matter, after acknowledging the consideration shown in connection with last year&apos;s wool clip, express their hope that the British Government will again assist the Union wool growers by purchasing
svicli portion of the 1918-19 wool clip as may he voluntarily offered within a given period. The Union Government further ask for information as to what extent the British Government would agree to the modifications suggested.by the Conference.Next Parliamentary Session. It is expected that tbe Union Parliament will meet about the middle of January. A strenuous session is anticipated in view of the determination of the Nationalists to continue their campaign in favour of Republicanism.Nationalist Leader on Empire and Peace Questions. -The Nationalist leader (General Hertzog), in the course of his recent tour of the northern portion of the Orange Free State Province, expressed his alarm at the prospect of transforming the Imperial Conference into a &quot; Federal Council,&quot; tightening the fetters of Empire. He continued to insist that the principle of self-determination &quot;approved by Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson warrants South Africa in demanding her independence. Regarding peace questions, General Hertzog is reported to have said : &quot; I fear that the Allies are not prepared to join President Wilson for the same reasons as I fear that they are out for Empire and not to help President Wilson. If peace does not come immediately it will be because the Allies, and, in the first place, British statesmen, are not prepared to give up the Empire idea. If the Allies do not accept President Wilson&apos;s views I hope that the powers President Wilson is now using to help the Allies will be turned against them.&quot; Answering a question, General Hertzog said that, in the event of Germany&apos;s winning the war, his conviction was that South Africa had nothing to fear from Germany.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are decdt loith in the Eastern Report.)Recruiting during 1918.-The following figures show the total recruits obtained throughout India for all arms and services during tbe months of January to August 1918, viz. :-Total Recruits obtainedMonth.
