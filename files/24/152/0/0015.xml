SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERAL. . REPORT No. 90.PART I. BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The suggested scheme for ensuring that the licences issued in respect of exports from the United States to the Dominions, India, &amp;c, shall correspond to the shipping-available involves the centre of control being located in London.Canada.       : -The firm attitude of the Dominion towards peace proposals is further emphasised this week.It will he interesting to see how the new Order-in-Council for the prevention of strikes will be applied, to the section of railway employees who are at present on strike.The completion of the shipbuilding programme of this and next year will find the Government owning and operating a considerable fleet of ships.The information given regarding land for soldiers&apos; settlement shows that the Government scheme contemplates the expropriation of privately owned land.The comparative figures relating to the employment of Canadian and British airmen in the field should be noted in connection with statements recently circulated.Other items of interest in this Report relate to the proposed Minister of Civil Service, the position of the pulp and paper industry, &amp;c.Australian Commonwealth.The general Commonwealth attitude on peace proposals is indicated by the Acting Prime Minister and the chief organs of the Press. It is of interest to note that, according to a Press cable, the reference made by Mr. Watt to the Pacific Islands apparently contemplates their &quot;neutralisation&quot; as a possible alternative to British rule.The constitution of a Coirncil of Defence is an important step in the national organisation of the Commonwealth.The regulations for compulsory loan subscriptions and the Government control of building and construction both emphasize the growing powers of the Common-wealth rather than those of the States.. The decision that there shall be no wartime prohibition will interest large sections of the community and especially women voters.The progress of the French Mission throughout the Commonwealth is apparently proving of value from the point of view of propaganda amongst the people, as well as from that of friendship between the two countries. . [p.t.o.
-   New Zealand.The-latest by-election is of even more significance than that commented upon last week. This is the first occasion upon which an independent Liberal has defeated a Government candidate since- the formation of the National Government, and.this affords one of several indications that, the Coalition may come to an end before the General Election next year.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The significance of the unrest in the United Provinces and Madras should not be exaggerated, as the disturbances seem to be merely of a local character.The attitude of the Non-Official Members towards the Constitutional Reform proposals is hardly that which might have been anticipated, and indicates a d esire for a larger measure of autonomy.The terms of reference to the Franchise and Functions Committees are of interest.Foreign Colonies in Africa.The points of information regarding Portuguese policy in Africa should be considered carefully. With the greater stability of the Portuguese Government, further Colonial activities may be anticipated.The proposal of Herr Erzberger as to the relation between the proposed League of Nations and Colonial possessions is of particular importance in view of the fact that the author has now assumed office in the Chancellor&apos;s Inner Cabinet. The references to the interests of the natives will be noted, and also the vague and impracticable suggestions as to the permanent neutralisation of Africa.II. iv IvOctober 17th, 1918.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Exports from the United States. The Charge cl&apos;Affaires at Washington has informed the Foreign Office regarding the position of exports from the United States, to various parts of the British Empire (excluding the United Kingdom and Canada). He points out that the commodities for export are either those included on the United States couservation list or those uot on that list. The former comprise essential articles, for which the War Trade Board will only consider the issue of export licences if the application is recommended, while the latter consist of goods of no great importance to the importiug country and regarding which the War Trade Board grant export licences freely. Owing, however, to the lack of control over shipping space on vessels going to the Dominions, India, and Colonies, it is often impossible for the exporter to get shipping space although he is in possession of an export licence. The War Trade Board state that this is objectionable and that it would be better if the export licence were refused in the first instance. Though requests to support applications are being received Rom the Dominion, Indian and Colonial Governments, it is impossible in many cases, the British Charge cVAffaires states, to decide whether a particular commodity is essential. After consultation with the War Mission and the Ministry of Shipping in New York, it is suggested that co-ordination must be secured between the number of applications for export licences which receive support and the probable tonnage available.It is therefore submitted that the War Trade Board should agree not to grant export licences unless recommended by the Embassy or War Mission, who in turn would only sanction the issue when so instructed by London. The orders requiring applications for export licences should be endorsed by the Dominion authorities interested, who should, only approve essential cases. In the above scheme, all applications passed by the Dominion authorities in respect of shipments from the United States would be sent in the first instance to London for submission to the American Board so that it could be ascertained whether shipping space could be allotted.In short the procedure would be analogous to that followed at present regarding shipments to the United Kingdom. It is considered essential that control should be centred in London, as neither the British Embassy nor the War Mission in the United States can decide as to the relative urgency of the applications put forward by the Dominions.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.Views on Peace Proposals. * The Acting Prime Minister (Sir George Foster) has issued a statement on the German proposals in the course of which he says :  &quot; If I read aright the sentiment of the Canadian people, they do not so greatly desire peace as to wish to conclude it before the Kaiser and his fellow conspirators are placed beyond the possibility of beginning anew the deadly game they have so successfully played during the past three decades.&quot;After a tour of the West, the President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. RoAvell) in an interview given at Ottawa declared that &quot; no portion of Canada has made a greater contribution to the war than our four Western Provinces, and their attitude towards the German peace proposals and the further prosecution of the war is clear and unmistakable. They demand not a negotiated, but a dictated peace, after the unconditional surrender of Germany, Austria and Turkey. They demand a peace dictated by the Allies not in the spirit of revenge, but in the interests of humanity and the future peace of the world.&quot;
government and Strikes.-An Order-in-Council lias been passed forbidding for tbe duration of the war strikes or lock-outs, and imposing severe penalties for a violation of the new regulations (vide Report No. 87 as to the necessity of recourse being had to a Board of Conciliation and Investigation).Any person found guilty of contravening the terms of the new Order is made liable upon conviction to a penalty not exceeding SI,000. or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both fine and imprisonment. Any male person of military age, employer or employee, who violates the regulations, will be deemed a soldier enlisted in the Military Forces of Canada, and subject to military law, without the right to apply for exemptiou under the Military Service Act.The regulations absolutely prohibit, during the continuance of the war, strikes or lock-outs in connection with any industry or railway which is considered essential to Canada&apos;s efficient performance of her war work.Under the Order-in-Council any employer of labour is guilty of the offence, and liable to the penalties defined, who during the war discharges or refuses to employ workers merely because they are members of a legitimate trades union, or for activities in connection therewith outside working hours.In explaining the Order, Senator Robertson, the Labour representative in the Cabinet, says that the present methods of adjustment provided had proved ample and satisfactory except for those who refused to use them. In peace times no such Order would be tolerated for a moment, nor would it be continued when the need had passed. It ought not to bring any disability on Labour organisation, but it would assist the Government in exercising proper control over enemies at home during the remainder of the war.In connection with the above a general strike by the Brotherhood of Railway Employees (comprising clerks, freight handlers, &amp;c.) was threatened in various parts of the Dominion this week on the ground that the railways (except the Inter-Colonial) refused to recognise this Union. The men at first refused, to submit their grievances to the Labour Adjustment Committee of the Railway War Board, but they ultimately agreed to do so. The Calgary freight handlers, who are still on strike, are apparently defying the new Order-in-Council.Shipbuilding. The Dominion Minister of Naval Service (Mr. C. C. Ballantyne) stated at St. John, N.B., last week that a $5,000,000 mill was now under construction at Sydney for the manufacture of 250,000 tons of ship-plates annually. It was expected that the plant would be complete and rolling ship-steel by next July. The Government, he said, had under construction 22 steel ships in Canada, the aggregate cost being $25,000,000. The construction next year would be considerably heavier, and the cost approximately $35,000,000. These ships would be owned and operated by the Canadian Government. There would be ready for sea this autumn, possibly, four ships of the 8,100-ton and 4,300-ton class. The Minister expressed his regret that it was impossible for the Government to grant permission to construct ships in Canada for Allied and neutral registry owing to the difficulty of securing the necessary quantity of ships&apos; plates required in the home building programme.Pulp and Paper Industry. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics has just completed an interesting census for last year of the Canadian pulp and paper industry. The census shows that 31 concerns are employed in the manufacture of pulp only, 26 produce paper only, and 23 turn out both pulp and paper. The total capital invested in the plants is 8186,375,000, and over 22,000 employees are engaged in the industry. Ground wood pulp was produced during the year to the total of over 921,000 tons, whilst the output of newsprint paper for the 12 months was approximately 690,000 tons, valued at $39,000,000.Proposed Minister of Civil Service. A deputation representing all branches of the Civil Service waited on the Cabinet last week and asked for the appointment of a permanent Minister to deal with matters affecting their interests. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir George Foster) who replied on behalf of the Government, was sympathetic with regard to the appointment of a Minister to deal with Civil Service matters, and said such an appointment was likely to be made.French Canadians and Tank Battalion. It is proposed to recruit the third Tank Battalion among Freuch-Canadians, thereby giving this element of the Canadian people distinctive recognition in a branch of the Army which has attracted much attention.
Prisoners in Holland. -The Dominion Minister of Overseas Military Forces (Sir Edward Kemp) before leaving for Washington and New York en route for London, made public a joint report by Major Blake and Colonel Birks, of the Y.M.C.A., on the condition of Canadian prisoners interned in Holland. This stated that the food the men were receiving was good, and that the conditions in this respect had improved since the supplementary British rations had begun to arrive.Soldiers&apos; Settlement. Some 800 returned soldiers have been given loans through the Soldiers&apos; Settlement Board, according to an announcement made at Ottawa. Of these, 500 were formerly farmers who have been rehabilitated and 300 are commencing the cultivation of the land for the first time. Loans advanced to the men total approximately f 1,000,000.The chief difficulties experienced up to now, so far as the West is concerned, is the lack of available land for homesteads near the railways. If the plans of the Dominion Minister for Colonisation and Immigration (Mr. J. A. Calder) go through, and privately-owned land in the West is expropriated, the Government will be able to secure large tracts for settlement purposes.Plans are being worked out now with the Province of Ontario for the extension of land settlement in that Province. The scheme is not confined to new districts, and in cases where the soldiers possess capital enough to settle in the older parts of the Province they may also be loaned $2,500.The development of non-producing lands in the Dominion, and the placing of such areas at the disposal of the right kind of post-war settlers, formed the subject * of a discussion at an informal conference last week at Victoria, B.C., between members of the Provincial Government and the Minister of Colonisation and Immigra-tion. The Minister explained that his visit was primarily to gauge the feeling of the Provincial authorities relating to the inauguration of a Canadian policy similar to that already instituted in British Columbia. The idea was to bring the vacant lands of the Dominion under occupation and production.The suggestion has been made that the Dominion should place its credit behind that of the various Provinces.Dominion Fighting Airmen. In connection with certain statements that have been circulated in Canada that 75 per cent, of the fighting airmen are Canadians, it has recently been pointed out by the Secretary of State for the Royal Air Force that the actual percentage of flying officers- in the force are as follows : Total. In the Field.Per cent. Pel- cent.(1) British       - - -   77 77(2) Canadians - - -   15 14(3) Other Dominions - -    8 9AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH. .Message to Allied Governments.  The following message from the Common-wealth Government has been communicated to the Governments of France, Italy, Greece and Serbia by the British representatives in the respective capitals, viz. :  &quot;Commonwealth Government sends its congratulations to Allied Governments on magnificent successes that are crowning Allied arms in all theatres of operation, and particularly on the surrender of Bulgaria which these successes&apos; have undoubtedly brought aboirt. The Government hails these victories as indications of the early ultimate success of the Allied efforts in the cause of liberty and civilisation.&quot;Views on Peace Offer. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. W^att) referring to the peace offer, said that Germany should not offer peace ; she should sue for it. While Germany is holding out the olive branch she is sacking cities and plundering and murdering hapless victims. He believed the answer of the Allied nations would be, &quot; Get back to the Rhine and then we will talk to you.&quot; The Abies should see the blackness of an awful night gather about Germany before they talked peace with her. He Wanted Australia to show that so far as her influence went the German Colonies ^would never be returned to ,Germany.   According to a Press cable, Mr. Watt is
reported to have added : &quot; Whether they he placed under the Union Jack or neutralised, Australians future safety depends on their never passing into Germany&apos;s hands.&quot;The influential newspapers characterise the peace offer, as an hypocrisy almost without example, a knavish trick, a signal of distress and amazing impudence. They assert that Germans are pariahs, incurable liars and cheats, with whom negotiation is impossible, and that the world will not stand a &quot; German &quot; peace.Council of Defence. Regulations have been issued constituting a Council of Defence to consist of the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy, the Minister of Defence, and four officers. Its chief functions are to inquire into and collect information regarding the following matters relating to the prosecution of the war :  Strategy, combined operations, exports, imports, manufacture, trade, intelligence, inventions, economies, transport, censorship, and legal questions.Control of Construction.-A. War Precautions regulation has been issued preventing persons, firms, companies, societies, clubs, associations, or any State authority from undertaking the construction of buildings, tramways, or markets without the consent of the Federal Treasurer. The Regulation applies also to churches costing over 1,000 ., and to additions and alterations involving over 250LCompulsory Loan Subscriptions. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr.&apos; Watt), in the House of Representatives, moved the second reading of a Bill making war loan subscriptions compulsory. This applies to the present and future loans to the extent of the shortage of voluntary subscriptions. Persons whose taxable income is under 2501. are exempt. Soldiers and sailors who have served .outside Australia are exempt as regards their income derived from personal exertion. The amount a person may be required to subscribe to loans in any year is not to exceed six times the yearly average of. his income tax for three preceding years. The Commissioner of Taxes is empowered to decide on objections, and a Board of Appeal is provided. The penalty for failing voluntarily to subscribe a sufficient amount is a sum equal to twice the yearly average income tax for the preceding three years, but the penalty does not relieve the person affected from the obligation to subscribe. The debate has been adjourned.Liabilities of Deceased Soldiers. The Federal Cabinet has decided to remit the penalties and forfeitures incurred during war service by deceased soldiers who died since July 1st last and whose accounts are not yet adjusted.Medical Treatment for Returned Soldiers. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) has approved a scheme for the medical treatment of discharged and returned soldiers who may be suffering from a recurrence of sickness resulting from wounds and injuries sustained while on active service.Control of Imports. Mr. Wait, the Acting Prime Minister, has announced that the Cabinet have approved the principle of controlling imports by a licence system ; details are being framed.War-time Prohibition. Mr. Watt, replying to a question in the House of Representatives, states that there is no present intention of introducing war-time prohibition.Leave for &quot; Anzacs.&quot; The Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr. Wise), replying to a question in the House of Representatives, said that the &quot; Anzacs &quot; will have 60 clays in Australia,   Subsistence allowance will be granted in advance.French Mission. Unusually warm demonstrations marked the journey of the French Mission from Sydney to Melbourne. The railway stations were decorated, and the platforms crowded.At Parliament House, Melbourne, 4,000 State school children, carrying miniature French flags, sang the national anthem in the presence of 100,000 people, General Pau was received by the Governor-General, Sir R. Munro Ferguson, who read an address of welcome in French, referring to the warm feelings o  friendship existing between France and Australia.   Parliamentary and civic receptions then took place.6033-3a B
Interviewed subsequently regarding peace, General Pau said : &quot; Before everything, we must demand complete evacuation, not only of Belgium, not onlv of the invaded territories of Prance, but also of the whole left bank of the Rhine. The Allied armies must hold the bridges across the Rhine, and they must also hold the port of Hamburg temporarily, so that if negotiations are entered into, our diplomats can act in perfect safety.&apos;&apos;NEW ZEALAND.Taranaki Py-Election. The result of the Taranaki by-election, which has been cabled to the Press, shows that the Independent Liberal candidate polled 2,840 votes as against 2,680 votes polled by the Reform candidate. The latter supported the Government in accordance with the arrangement made between the Liberal and Reform Parties when the National Government was formed, and unlike the last by-election (vide Report No. 89) both candidates were conscriptionists.Arrival Home of Prime Minister and Sir Joseph Ward. It is announced&apos;that the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) and the Minister of Finance (Sir Joseph Ward) arrived at Auckland On October 12th.National Day of Prayer. The Dominion Government have, telegraphed to the British Government that they will be glad to receive intimation as early as possible as to whether the first Sunday in the New Year, or any other date, is to be observed as a National Day of Prayer.SOUTH AFRICA.The Prime Minister. General Botha is continuing to make excellent progress towards recovery.Loss of the &quot; Hiramo Mam.&quot; It is reported that the Government statement announcing the torpedoing of the Japanese passenger steamer Hiramo Maru, with the loss of 37 South African passengers, following as it does the- loss of the Galway Castle, has been keenly felt throughout South Africa. Two of the missing, Mr. Alwyn Vintcent and Mr. Lawrence Woodhead, were members of the Union House of Assembly ; while another member of the Union Parliament (Dr. Bunt Lie) was drowned when the Galway Castle went down.INDIA.(Excluding Externcd Affairs, which are dealt loith in the Eastern Report.)Internal Situation: Unrest in. United Provinces and Madras.: The Viceroy has informed the Secretary of State for India that there was no recrudesceuce of rioting in Patna, and that the conditions there are now normal. It is stated that the Bakr Id festival passed off quietly almost everywhere, but at Katarfur, near Hard war, in the -United Provinces, there was serious rioting, and 17 Muhammadans are reported to have been killed and burnt in their houses. There is unrest, particularly in Madras, on account of the high prices of foodstuffs and other necessaries. This is stated to be giving cause for anxiety.Non-official Members and Constitutional Reforms. It will be recalled that in the course of the debate in the Legislative Council on Constitutional Reforms, which took place on September 9th, Mr. Surendranath Banerjee moved a Resolution recognising the Reforms Scheme as a definite advance towards the progressive realisation of responsible Government and suggesting that a Committee of all non-Official Members should be appointed to make recommendations upon it (vide Report No. 85).
The report of the Committee of non-official members of the Legislative Council,, which was appointed in accordance &quot;with Mr. Banerjee&apos;s Resolution, has now been presented and is signed by 17 members, six of whom present separate notes.According to communications issued to the Press, the Committee propose that half the members of the Secretary of State&apos;s Council shordd be Indians elected by the non-official members of the Council of State and the Legislative Assembly. A IVivv Council for India is condemned. It is further proposed that certain subjects dealt with by the Government of India be transferred, as in the case of provincial Govern-ments, with Ministers in charge ; also that the procedure of certification mentioned in paragraph 15 of the First Appendix of the chelmsford-Montagu Report be confined to matters affecting the public peace, tranquillity, and defence of the country. Other recommendations are that there should be fiscal autonomy, as enjoyed by the self-governing Dominions ; and that 50 per cent, of the whole cadre of the Civil Service be recruited in India ; but the recommendations of the Reforms Report relating to pay and pensions are disapproved. The Committee further propose that 25 per cent, of the recruitment for the commissioned ranks of the Army should be from Indians.Two European non-official members deprecate changes in the legislative machinery of the Government of India simultaneously with far-reaching experiments in the provinces, and do not consider that any case is made out for going beyond the recommendations of the Public Services Commission regarding the admission of Indians to the Services. They hold that the Reforms Report shows imperfect appreciation of the claims of the non-official European community, and protest against the denial of communal electorates to that community.Constitutional Reforms: Franchise and Functions Committees. In the Report of the Secretary of State and the Viceroy on Indian Constitutional Reforms, certain matters were left for settlement in detail in the light of the advice to be given by two Committees who were to enquire in India into questions connected with the franchise and the division of functions between the Government of India and the Local Governments ; and between the official and popular elements in the Local Govern-ments. The Secretary of State for India has appointed the two Committees, and they will begin their work in India shortly.The M embers of the Franchise Committee are : -The Rt. Hon.

(paragrarjhs 213 and 240) ; (hi) wdtich of the functions to be discharged by Provincial Governments can be transferred at the outset in each province to the charge of Ministers (paragraph 238); (iv) the powers which should be exercised by the Governor-in-Council in relation to transferred subjects, &amp;c. (paragraph 240).In that the work of the two Committees is interdependent, arrangements have been made to connect them. The whole enquiry will be conducted under the presidency of Lord Southborough and the two Committees will work under his direction.FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;c, IN AFRICA.PORTUGUESE COLONIAL POLICY.1The Secretary of State for the Colonies in Portugal, Senhor Vasconcellos e Sa2 has initiated a new policy in regard to Colonial problems since he came into office in May 1918.West Africa: Loanda-Ambaca Railway. Within his short term of office Senhor Vasconcellos e Sa has put an end to the prcblem of the Loanda-Ambaca Railway by taking it over from the Portuguese Company in July last. This railway is of considerable importance in the development of the country as it is one of the three lines of penetration3 into Angola, and the riches of the Colony are located in1 The information contained in these paragraphs lias been compiled from a recent speech of the Colonial Minister in the Portuguese Parliament, and from other Portuguese official sources.2 Senhor Vasconcellos e Sa, before taking- office, was a Captain in the Navy Medical Service, and lias visited all the Portuguese Colonies. He volunteered for the expedition against the Germans ih Southern Angola, and took an active part in their defeat. . Besides acting in his medical capacity, he led columns of Infantry to the attack, was wounded, and was awarded the highest military order of bis. rank. After the border war was over, he undertook an expedition to the interior of the country in order to study the essential problems of Southern Angola.3 The three main lines of penetration into Angola are: (1) The Loanda-Lucalla Malan je-railway in the direction of Lunda and presumed to join the Congo lines (&quot;500 kilometres) ; (2) the Lobito or Benguella railway (360 kilometres) in the Katanga mines direction; (3) the Mossamedes railway over 200 kilometres long in the direction of the very healthy and rich plateau of Htulla. This line has been improved since the war against German South West.,
the interior. The policy of the Minister, therefore, is to concentrate upon the construction of railways from the coast to the interior, and in taking possession of the Loanda line the Government intend not only to work the extension of the line up to Malanje, hut to develop the line from Malanje up to the district of Lund a, where minerals and rubber are reported to be abundant. This would mean the construction of some 600 kilometres of line and probably the junction of the Portuguese line of -Northern Angola with the Belgian system of the Central Congo. During the time that the railway has been controlled by the Portuguese Company since 1885, the Portuguese Treasury has given to the Company in the form of grants in aid, &amp;c, some 4,000,000 sterling, and when the news that the Government had redeemed the concession, and was working the line, was announced in Angola, much satisfaction was expressed by Chambers of Commerce, Leagues of Trade, Municipalities and persons having money invested in the country, who extended their thanks to the Minister for his decision. Capital, material and personnel necessary for the repair and working of the line are now on their way to Angola.Redemption of other Concessions. In addition to the above Senhor Vasconcellos e Sa has provided for the redemption of such concessions as may be useful to the State. This action is said to have inspired confidence amongst Portuguese capitalists in that it renders more secure the land in West Africa available for agricultural purposes. For example, the National Overseas Bank &apos;of Lisbon has issued shares 200 per cent, above par, and the subscription was covered twice. Its reserve fund equals its share capital. The Portuguese Steamship Line, which was owned by a private company, has been transformed into a limited liability company, and its shares were under-written at 100 per cent, above par. The Agricultural Company of the Island of Principe, the most powerful agricultural concern in Portuguese West Africa, has its shares quoted at 700 per- cent, of their nominal value. The Cabinda Company in the Portuguese Congo district has been financed by the National Overseas Bank, and promises a great deal in cocoa, cotton, rubber and wood. Other important concerns in West Africa have seen their investments valued threefold.Wireless Stations. An agreement was made between Senhor Vasconcellos e Sa-and the Marconi Wireless Company last July that wireless stations should be erected at Cape Verde, San Thome and Angola. In the last-named colony the whole area will be in touch with the long-distance coastal and land stations by means of transportable wireless cars. If the necessary material reaches Africa in time, the work should begin in November, and within a short period Portuguese West Africa will be in connection by wireless with Mozambique and the rest of the world.Mozambique. Special attention is being paid by Senhor Vasconcellos e Sa to the-military expedition to Mozambique, and reinforcements are being sent. The Minister appreciates the importance of developing this rich country1 from which foodstuffs, such as sugar, maize, beans, vegetable fats, &amp;c, are being exported to the Allied countries in Europe, and even to Central Africa. Agricultural products and such commodities as fibres, ivory, rubber, coal, &amp;c, are being developed progressively.GERMAN COLONIES.League of Nations and Colonial Possessions : German Proposal. The Vossische Zeitung of September 21st published a draft constitution for the League of Nations contained in a treatise by 11 err Erzberger, the prominent member of the Centre Party, who has lately become Secretary of State and head of the Imperial Press Ministry (dealing with propaganda, &amp;c). In the course of this important draft, lierr Erzberger proposes that the League of Nations shall guarantee the undisturbed possession of the colonies of the League States. He submits that the &quot;League Powers shall carry on their Colonial work in a spirit of Christian civilisation, and have the protection and the moral and economic education of the natives at heart.&quot; He continues : &quot; All States and Colonies in Africa shall be permanently neutral States.&quot; Under the last proviso, the States whose Governments declare their permanent neutralisation &quot; shall enjoj&apos; the protection of the League of Nations as a whole.&quot;1 Part of the territories of Mozambique are State-administered and part are under the rule of Chartered Companies. Sugar is the most valuable product of the province and the Chartered Companies contribute more largely to the total output than the State territories.
