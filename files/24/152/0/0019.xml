APPRECIATION  Oh THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 94.PART I.   BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.Various points of information connected with the attendance of representatives from the Dominions and India at the approaching Session of the Imperial War Cabinet will be found in this Report under the headings of the countries concerned.Canada.The decision to establish a &quot; Canada Mission &quot; in London, in order to secure for the Dominion Government direct representation in commercial and financial matters, is of importance, more especially in relation &quot;to matters of reconstruction. While the functions of such a Mission should not affect in any way those of a possible Ministerial representative in London, it will be interesting to see in what manner the work will affect that carried on by the High Commissioner.The figures relating to the total Avar expenditure and net debt of the Dominion are of interest.The meeting of the grain growers this month to discuss tariffs and other post-war matters may have considerable effect on Dominion policy. :It is interesting to note that for the first time a Labour Member of Parliament becomes Minister of Labour in the Dominion Cabinet.The trade figures for the last 12 months show a balance of exports over imports aud also prove that the position of the United Kingdom as the best customer of the Dominion is maintained.The Railway War Board report as to the readiness of the railways to meet peace conditions is highly satisfactory.Australian Commonwealth.Mr. Hughes in his criticism relating&apos;to consultation with the Dominions, especially in regard to any limitation, of Commonwealth- rights as to post-war economic policy and tariff distinctions, can hardly have had in view the constitutional practice pursued before Commercial Treaties have a binding effect upon the Dominions. The liberty of the Dominions in reference to Commercial Treaties was further emphasised by the Resolution (No. XIX.)-passed by the Imperial Conference of 1911 on the proposal of Sir W. Laurier, and it will be recalled that General Botha made
special reference to this in April last when discussing the question of the renewal of Commercial Treaties with enemy Powers (vide Report No. 65).There appears to be considerable feeling in the Commonwealth in favour of Australia being indemnified by the enemy Powers for her war expenditure.The final figures for the War Loan show that the estimate of the Acting Prime Minister has been exceeded.New Zealand.The explanation given to Sir Joseph Ward as to his position in relation to the Prime Minister in matters of Imperial consultation will be of interest to the Dominions who are represented by more than one Minister, particularly in the cases where the representatives of a Dominion consist of the heads of two Parties in a Coalition Government.India.&apos; (Excluding External Affairs.).The speech of the President of the Moderate Conference is obviously intended as a grave warning, of the consequences of abandoning or curtailing the proposals for Constitutional Reform.The proposal for fiscal autonomy w&apos;as a feature of the Moderate Conference.German Colonies.The German Wireless comments upon the wishes of South Africa regarding the Tetention of the South West Protectorate are obviously not written by a person who knows anything of the Union.II. hh.November 14th, 1918.

PART  I. -BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Imperial War Cabinet. Information as to the attendance of representatives from -Canada, Newfoundland, New Zealand and India for the forthcoming meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet will be found under the headings referring to those countries. (Vide also Report No. 93.)SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Dominion Representatives coming to England. The Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) has informed the British Government as to those who will accompany him on his forthcoming visit to England. &quot; Amongst them will be the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir George Foster), the Minister of Customs (Mr. A. L. Siftou), the Chairman of the Dominion War Mission at Washington (Colonel Lloyd Harris), the Judge Advocate-General (Colonel O. M. Biggar), and others. (Vide cdso Report No. 93.)ft is announced that Sir Thomas White will be Acting-Prime Minister while Sir R. Borden is away. During the absence of Sir George Foster it is announced that Mr. A. K. Maclean will be acting Minister of Trade and Commerce, and that Mr. J. D. Reid will take the place of Mr. Sifton at the Ministry of Customs.It is further announced that the Minister of Justice (Mr. C. J. Doherty) will proceed to England as soon&apos;as his duties permit of his departure.Trade Mission in London  The Government have decided to establish a Canadian Trade Mission in London, and Colonel Lloyd Harris, the Chairman of the Dominion War Missiomat Washington, has been appointed chairman.The Government announcement states that it is probable that for a considerable-period after the war the purchase and distribution of a large portion of Canadian exportable agricultural articles will be made through Governmental agencies established in Great Britain and the Allied&apos; nations. The appointment of this Trade Mission is another step in carrying out the policy of the Government to secure direct representa-tion for Canadian matters affecting her agricultural, industrial, commercial, and financial interests, and also to assist in obtaining the best possible market for the surplus products of farm, factory, forest, mines, and fisheries.It is therefore stated to be desirable that Canada should be directly represented in London by men in touch with business and agricultural interests in the.Dominion, for the promotion and the safeguarding of their interests. The chairman is empowered to represent the Government and. its various departments and other administrative branches in the negotiations&quot; The Mission will be known as the &quot; Canada Mission.&quot;In connection with the above, statements haAre been published in the Press to the effect that Colonel Lloyd Harris is taking to England details of what the Dominion is prepared to do in connection with Allied orders for rebuilding the destroyed portions of Europe. In a recent statement the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) is reported to have said : &quot; By reason of the part she has played in the war, Canada is entitled as of right to share in business reconstruction.&quot;Siberian Economic Mission. Mr. Loins Kon, who is a Russian by birth but a naturalised Canadian, has been appointed one of the Secretaries to the Canadian Economic Mission to Siberia.
War Expenditure and Belt. The Department of Finance has issued a statement showing how the total war expenditure of the Dominion, which now amounts to f1,046,944,000, is spread over the several fiscal years since hostilities commenced.The following table gives the to tab cost of the w-ar in each year : &apos; i1914-15 - -- -        60,750,0001915-16 - - - 166,197,0001916-17 - - -      306,488,0001917-18 - -        -     343,835,000The total war expenditure in the seven months of the present fiscal year ending October 31 st was $169,574,000.The total net debt of the Dominion at the end of October stood at 11,287,000,000.After-War Tariffs: Meeting of Grain Growers. Grain growers all over the Dominion are to meet at Winnipeg on November 26th to discuss post-war policies, more especially with regard to the tariff. It was originally intended to discuss the tariff question with representatives of the Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association, but it is now doubtful if such a meeting can take place, as the manufacturers state that their side of the case is not sufficiently prepared for it to be presented at so early a date.The farmers are said to have an elaborate programme of subjects prepared for discussion.Labour Minister of Labour.-The Minister of Labour (Mr. T. W. Crothers) has resigned on account of ill-health. Senator Gideon Robertson has been appointed to succeed Mr. Crothers. Senalor Robertson was the first representative of labour to enter the Federal Cabinet, joining the Union Government wdien it was formed. He has played a prominent part ever since in settling labour troubles in the Dominion.Exports and Impoiis : United Kingdom, as best Customer. The Dominion Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. a. Calder) reported on November 8th that restricted imports, due in a large measure to the shortage of shipping, had again affected the Canadian Customs receipts. The decrease in October, however, was not excessive.   The Minister states that  -&quot;Both exports from and imports into the Dominion showed a decline for the 12 months ended September, the exports this year totalling upwards of $1,363,000,000, a decrease of nearly $18,000,000, while imports during the same xDeriod were valued at approximately $900,000,000, a falling off of over $107,000,000. The balance of exports over imports last year reached the record figure of more than 8466,000,000, which is approximately $90,000,000 higher than the balance for the previous twelve-monthly period. The United Kingdom was the Dominions best customer, taking over $716,000,000 worth of Canadian products.&quot;Victory Loan.-- The end of the second week of the Victory Loan showed that the total subscribed was $313,200,000 which is 8100,000,000 in excess of the amount contributed in the same period last year. Ontario has subscribed over one-half of the total.   Toronto claims $61,000,000 as against the $60,000,000 of Montreal.Dominion Railways. The Executive Committee of the Railway War Board, in the course, of a statement reviewing the condition of the Dominion Railways, state that the advent of peace conditions will find the railways able to meet the most complete changes in the current of traffic without confusion. The statement adds that the labour situation is satisfactory except that the roads are still under-staffed, and concludes :  &quot;Plans are being perfected for a further unification of terminal and.other dacilities. We have reason to believe that the railway system of Canada is in a mom perfect condition to face peace conditions and the reconstruction period than any in the world.&quot;6817-2a A 2
NEWFOUNDLAND.Imperial War Cabinet. In response to the invitation of the Prime Minister of ike United Kingdom, the Prime Minister of Newfoundland (Mr. Lloyd) informed the British Government that he would he ready to start for England at any moment that his presence might he desired. Mr. Lloyd was thereupon informed that he should be prepared to sail when it was known that Germany had accepted the armistice terms, and a telegram has now been received to the effect that the Newfoundland Premier is leaving as soon as a passage can be arranged.A U SDK A Li AN CO MMON WE ALT H.Prime Minister and Peace Terms : President Wilson&apos;&apos;s 1! Points. In connection with the references made by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to the Versailles Council and consultation with the Dominions on peace terms (vide Report No. 93), Mr. Hughes addressed an important letter to The Times on November&apos;9th. After referring to the fact that he had been asked by his Government to remain in Great Britain in order to be at hand when peace terms were being settled, Mr. Hughes observed : &quot; My Government are of the opinion that certain of President Wilson&apos;s 14 points are not satisfactory. It specifically objects inter alia to Point 3, which deals with the posDwar economic policy and limits the right of the Commonwealth to make such tariff distinctions&apos; between one nation and another as it may think proper ; &quot;and to Point 5 relating to the Colonies in the Pacific formerly held by Germany, the retention of which my Government deems vital to the national safety of Australia. I have remained here at my Government&apos;s request for the purpose of setting forth its viewrs with which I need hardly say I agree before any. terms of peace were definitely settled. But no opportunity has been given me to do so. I was not even informed that the peace terms v^ere being discussed at the Versailles Conference  Avhich I had presumed was engaged in settling the terms of the armistice with Germany as it had done in the case of Austria. The first intimation I received that the terms of peace had been discussed at Versailles was conveyed in the document which notified me that they had been definitely settled.&quot; Mr. Hughes, in commenting upon this, says that he considers that the position thus outlined fully justified his expression of regret that Australia was not asked to express its opinions on these terms before they were settled, and, wdiile admitting that &quot; representatives of the Dominions have, during the sittings of the Imperial Cabinet, discussed at large the question of peace,&quot; Mr. Hughes states that Dr. Wilson&apos;s 14 points were never agreed to nor even specifically discussed.Peace Terms : German Colonies and IndemnityAt a great meeting in Melbourne Town Hall held last week to celebrate the defeat of Turkey and Austria, resolutions were carried&apos; congratulating the Allied Armies on their successes and expressing an unalterable desire that the former German Colonies in the Pacific and elsewhere should not be returned to Germany. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) stated : &quot; There must be reparation, restitution and suitable guarantees for the safety of the future. Australia has been living in a foobs paradise, but never will Germany bo permitted to return to the position of danger to the Common-wealth.&quot;With reference to the Resolution of the Melbourne City Council, asking that Great Britain shall insist on an adequate indemnity for Australia (vide Report No. 92) the Returned Soldiers&apos; Association are sending the Resolution to every Municipal Council in the Commonwealth requesting them to adopt it.The Premier of Tasmania has suggested that the Commonwealth Government should ask for a German indemnity sufficient to cover war expenditure, including pensions and the cost of repatriation.In the Legislative Council of New South Wales on October 30th, Mr. Manning-gave notice of a motion that no peace is satisfactory to Australia which does not stipulate that Germany shall recoup the Commonwealth for all moneys expended on the war.
Soldiers&apos; Settlement on the Land. The Ministers of Lands of various States have held a conference with Mr. E. D. Mi lien, Minister in Charge of Repatriation, regardino-the settlement of soldiers on the land.War Loan resident.-The final figures show that the amount of 43,850,1007, has been subscribed to the War Loan.NEW   ZEALAND.Imperial War Cabinet: Prime Minister and Sir Joseph Ward.- AVith reference to the forthcoming meeting of tbe Imperial War Cabinet (vide Report No. 93, under &quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;) the Prime Minister of the Dominion (Mr. Massey) was informed by the British Government that he should be ready to sail as soon as it was known that Germany had accepted the Armistice terms.Sir Joseph Ward has been informed that, if he comes with Mr. Massey, he will attend the Imperial War Cabinet in the same way as he did last year, whenever sessions are held, but that he will no doubt understand that the urgent necessity of concentrated work, of the special kind which lies ahead, in as few hands as possible will in practice restrict consultation on very many points to the Prime Ministers.Attitude of Meat Producers. The Prime Minister of the Dominion (Mr. Massey) has informed the British Government that he received a deputation of meat producers on November 7th, who made strong representations to the effect that owing to the considerable amount of meat in cold store in the Dominion it was desirable that the existing arrangements with reference to meat requisitions for Imperial purposes should be continued [for another year from June 30th, after the signing of peace, in order to give the producers &apos;and freezing companies in the Dominion a fair start after the meat had been delivered. The Dominion Government have asked the British Government to treat this matter favourably.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Imperial War Cabinet. In response to the invitation of the British Government, Sir S. P. Sinha will attend the session of the Imperial War Cabinet as the represen-tative of India.Internal Situation. The Viceroy has informed the Secretary of State for India that the agricultural situation continues bad, and that petty looting has occurred in some places. Influenza is causing heavy mortality throughout India. The Muharran passed off quietly.Moderate Conference. The meeting of the Moderate Conference on November 1st called forth some notable speeches.The President (Mr. Surendranath Banerjee), in referring to the Constitutional Reform proposals, declared, according to published reports, that it was the guiding principle of the Moderates &quot;to co-operate when we can and criticise when we must.&quot; He observed : &quot;Full autonomy, provincial or Imperial, we cannot have all at once. The stages are indicated in the Report. They are progressive in their character; there can only be difference of opinion about the pace. The whole fabric of reform is based on the confidence of its framers that the j)people of India will rise to the height of the occasion and justify the great experiment.&quot;In concluding, Mr. Banerjee made the following remarkable appeal: &quot; AVe have endeavoured to do our duty. The Government must fulfil its part. The attitude of the British Government in England in regard to the reform proposals is, so far as one can judge, unsatisfactory, and even ominous. If the enactment of the reform proposals is unduly postponed, if they are whittled down in any way, if the whole of what is recommended is not given and I think that in regard to the Government of
India there ought to he greater advance there will be grave public discontent, followed by agitation the magnitude of which it would be difficult to exaggerate. . We want peace and rest. We want steady, progressive development, accomplished by co-operation between people and Government. We firmly believe that the reform proposals, with modifications on the lines of the message, will accomplish this great object. Bat this bright prospect will, if the reports proposals are dropped or their beneficent   scope   is curtailed, be overshadowed by a dark cloud of contention,controversy, and agitation, the future of which none can divine.....Is Indiato be converted by the unwisdom of our rulers into a greater Ireland ? Let the British Cabinet make its choice. But I have no doubts, no misgivings. The good sense of the British democracy will prevail.&quot;At the second day of the Conference it is reported that Sir N. G. Chandavarkar referred specifically to the opposition of those who used the Rowlatt Report to obstruct Indian constitutional progress. He said that from his knowledge of revolutionary crime in Bengal he was convinced that the only effective way of preventing revolutionary crime was the introduction of liberal measures of administration.Sir Fazulbhoy Currimbhoy moved a fiscal resolution, declaring that, save such equal and equitable Imperial obligations as may be agreed upon as resting on all parts of the Empire, the Government of India, acting- under the control of the Legislature, should enjoy the same power of regulating the fiscal policy of India as the Governments of the self-governing Dominions enjoy.FOREIGN&apos; COLONIES IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.South-West Africa: German Allegations. German Wireless of November 6th contained the following : &apos;; For a long time representatives of the British Govern-in enti--and. ;the British Press have been asserting that certain German colonies could inot, ;be; returned to German;/ owing to the pronounced opposition of the neighbouring Dominions. For instance, it is alleged that the South African Union will not permit the return of German South-West Africa with its strongly established German population. The fact is, however, that an overwhelming majority of South Africans, who are no longer represented in the Cape Town Parliament, is against the forcible incorporation of German South-West Africa in the Union. South Africans demand- rather, in an overwhelming majority, that the white inhabitants of German South-West&apos;;Africa should decide on the basis of the right of self-determination whether they consent to the incorporation of their country in the Union or desire tO: remain- German in accordance with public law. Botha &quot;and Smuts even to a smaller degree do not speak ..... in the name of this powerful South African majority.&quot;    :1 French. View pf German Colonies. Lord Derby in a telegram, dated November 4th, called attention to an article in Evenement which refers to a passage&quot; in Lord Northdliife&apos;s recent article in The Times dealing with former German Colonies and declares that although on this point Lord Northcliffe&apos;s views are not identical with those of President Wilson they are not in contradiction with them. The President, it is observed, abstains from saying -that German Colonies should be restored to Germany and advocates an &quot;arrangement.&quot; The importance of this /point has, in the opinion of Fvenement, been much exaggerated ; and the journal points out that the colonial question is one which Germany concerns itself least about.German Colonial Secretary. A Press report indicates that Herr Scheidemann has been appointed Minister foivFinance and Colonies in the German Government. (Vide also under &quot; Germany,&quot; Part II.)
