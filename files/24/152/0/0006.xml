SECRET,APPRECIATION OP THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 81.PART I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The establishment of a distinctively Canadian Air Force is an event of importance in the national history of the Dominion.The statement of the Minister of Finance upon the financial position and, as to the ability of the Dominion to earn the cost of the war, and to make an increase in national wealth, is of considerable interest.The decision of the Government of the Dominion to mobilise men for service in Siberia connects Canada more closely with a further sphere of international interest.The steps taken by the Government to keep in touch with labour conditions, and to prevent further labour difficulties arising on the railways, should be noted.The increase of the trade of the Dominion with the United States is one of the striking facts of the war.australian  LI an 0 0 M M on wea LTH.The statement regarding the attitude of labour towards the war is of interest, though it should be remembered that the various influences affecting the sections and sub-sections of labour opinion, especially in New South Wales, are scarcely capable of accurate estimation at the present time.The National Propaganda Campaign, if carried out on the lines appearing in this Report, should go far towards bringing home to the general body of the people the vital issues involved in the Avar. That this is a real necessity has been clearly indicated in the recent pronouncements of Mr. Watt.The proceedings of the Council of Commerce and Industry show that practical steps are being taken to organise industry with a view to post-war conditions. Though receiving the assistance of the Government, the resolutions emphasise that the organisation is non-political.The Defence Departments system for perpetuating the traditions of the Australian Imperial Force units, and for enrolling discharged soldiers in the Army Reserve, may prove of first-rate importance in the future.New Zealand.The latest figures concerning the population of the Dominion are of interest.[p.t.o.
Sooth Africa.The statement of Mr. Malan as to the obligations attaching to the rights, which Dutch-South Africans have enjoyed through the British connection may help to inculcate a broader conception of the duties of Empire citizenship.The Nationalist. Conference Resolution is obviously designed to increase the&apos; voting strength of the Party by an argumentative appeal to racial prejudice.The declaration of General Botha as to the only kind of peace that can be contemplated does not leave room for any doubt as to the views of the Union Government. Much regret will be felt at the unfortunate indisposition of General Botha necessitating the postponement of his visit to the Free State Province for the ministerial campaign.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)Political interest appears to have been confined to the Report on Constitutional-Reforms and to the Rowlatt Committee Report.German Colonies.The German view upon the power of the British economic weapon in regard to the control of raw materials is well illustrated in the remarkable article by Professor Schumacher to which attention is called in this Report.H. d&apos;E.August 15th, 191.8.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Formation of Canadian Air Force. Since assuming office as Dominion Minister of Overseas Military Forces, Sir Edward Kemp has given considerable attention to the position of Canadian airmen. The result is the formation of a nucleus, consisting of two squadrons, of a Canadian Air Force.These squadrons are being organised in England by the Overseas Military Forces -of Canada, in conjunction with the Royal Air Force.The personnel of the squadrons is to be drawn from, officers and men of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada, who at the present time are serving with the Royal Air Force, or from those who are Canadian citizens serving with the Air Force. Additional requirements, if necessary, are to be made up by special, enlistments or transfer from other Canadian services of men with suitable qualifications.Canada assumes the responsibility of payment of personnel and of the initial supply of clothing, and undertakes to maintain the force in any theatre of war on a per capita scale.The Air Council (Imperial) assumes the command and administration of. the two scpuadrons. whether in a theatre of war or under training in Great Britain, and responsibility for the provision, maintenance and replacement of machines, technical equipment and supplies, and the provision of the necessary facilities for training.Promotions and appointments are the prerogative of the Minister of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada, upon the recommendation of the Royal Air Force. In all other matters the personnel of the Canadian squadrons is subject to the Air Force Act in precisely the same manner as any other squadron.Financial Position. The Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) has issued a review of the financial position of the Dominion. In the course of this, the Minister declares that the Dominion is earning at home the money she is spending on the war, and, owing to her great agricultural and other natural resources, skilfully worked and directed, Canada has been able as a nation not only to earn the entire cost of the war to date, but to make a very substantial increase in national wealth as well. He farther states that in all probability the last Victory Loan Bonds will stand well above the original cost by the time the forthcoming loan campaign is launched. &quot;If, from the increase in bank deposits, new securities, goods, commodities, and other property now owned by the people of Canada over and above what they possessed in 1911,&quot; Sir Thomas continues, &quot; there be deducted the whole debt of the country clue to the war, the surplus would be found to be very great indeed.&quot;In concluding the Finance Minister states &quot; The maintenance and increase of the working capital of the Dominion is at this juncture one of the most supreme national duties before the Canadian people.&quot;The Dominion&apos;s total revenue for the. four months of the current fiscal year amounted to 891,954,000, an increase of nearly -39,000,000 on the corresponding-period of 1917. The total general expenditure showed an increase of over SS,000,000, and amounted to nearly $33,000,000. The war expenditure for the four months amounted to a little over $44,000,000, an increase of less than $500,000. The total net debt of the Dominion on July 31st stood at $1,172,323,489, an increase approximately of $312,000,000 over the debt at the same date last year.Dominion Troops for Siberia. In connection with the Allied assistance that is to be rendered to the Czecho-Slovaks and Russians, the Dominion Government have authorised the mobilisation of a special force of about 4,000 men for service in ^Siberia, with a base at Vladivostock.   Brigadier-General J. H. Emsley, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., Royal Canadian Dragoons, has been selected to command the Dominion troops.Labour Questions. A Sub-Committee of &apos; the Reconstruction and Development Committee of the Cabinet has been appointed to keep in touch with labour conditions
in Canada, and to recommend measures to be adopted respecting the industrial problems in the country.The body will be known as the Labour Committee, and its Chairman will be Senator Gideon Robertson (the Labour representative in the Cabinet), while the Minister of Labour (Mr. Crothers) and the President of the Trades and Labour Council (Mr. J. C. Watters) will be amongst the members of the Committee, The Committee will work in close co-operation with the Department of Labour.With reference to the statement appearing in last week&apos;s Report (No. 80), an agreement has been signed between six great Railway Brotherhoods and the Canadian Railway War Board providing for the submission of. all labour differences to&quot; the Railway Labour Board of Canada. The personnel of this new Board will consist of six Labour leaders and a similar number of railway officials. The Board will commence work immediately on various points which will have to be worked out in connection with the application of the McAdoo schedule of wages.Trade ivitli United States. The extent to which Oanada&apos;s trade with the United States has grown is shown in that country&apos;s statement of imports for the fiscal year ending in June. Canada, with S434;254,567, led all foreign countries in the value of goods sold to the United States. Grain and nickel constituted the bulk of this trade.Deserters in the United States. The Dominion Government have accepted the-draft Convention for the reciprocal arrest and return of deserters from the Canadian and United States forces.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Labour and the War. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), in reviewing the attitude of Labour towards the war, stated last week that in Western Australia the National Labour Party was heart and soul with the Labour parties in the allied countries in their endeavour to crush German militarism. It included the bulk of the leaders of Labour. In that State a number of unions has seceded from the official Labour Party, and a similar state of things existed in South Australia. A movement -in the same direction was taking place in Victoria. He said he had no doubt that the extremists in New South Wales would cause a similar revulsion of feelins; am one-unionists who put the country oefore party.National Propaganda Campaign. An influential deputation, comprising repre-sentatives of leading associations, clubs, municipalities, the learned professions, Universities, public schools, and returned soldiers, waited on the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) last week, and urged that the Federal Ministry should support the National Propaganda Campaign. It was proposed that the work of the Press should be supplemented by the preparation of literature and pamphlets for circulation in every household in Australia ; that greater use should be made of picture shows and public platforms ; that meetings should be organised at public places, and at theatres and halls, where properly trained speakers could tell the truth about the war issues. The deputation also recommended the appointment of a directorate of three persons, chosen for their educational qualifications, and for their organising ability, to visit various States and form organisations for carrying on work in conjunction with the existing bodies. It was essential that the directorate should have a free hand in policy, and not be controlled either by the Government or party.In reply, Mr. Watt said the conditions in Australia during the past 12 months had been causing much more apprehension to those responsible for the government, of the country than probably members of the deputation knew. He would not pronounce on the methods they had outlined at that stage, beyond saying that they seemed to him on the right lines. As to the Government supporting them either with its approval in launching the movement, or with financial assistance, or in other ways later on, this could only be clone on condition that this was not, a party movement. For a long time there had been growing in Australia the lamentable view that the Government was something which existed for its own sake apart from the people and nation, but the Government was the nation, and in time of war had no right to be. anything else. He was prepared to say to his colleagues that if this was the sentiment in which the deputation viewed the matter, they should have no hesitation
in asking Parliament to provide for a properly governed movement to re-educate the people as to the meaning of this war.Since Mr. Watt delivered his reply, the Federal Cabinet have announced their approval of the Citizens&apos; Committee&apos;s scheme for National Propaganda.Organisation of Commerce and Industry. A conference of the General Council of the Commonwealth Bureau of Commerce and Industry (vide Report No. 58) has elected a Council composed of representatives of primary producers, and of banking, skipping and metal interests, of the Chambers of Manufacturers, and of Commerce. The following resolutions were passed: (1) A declaration that the organisation was to be non-Governmental and non-political; (2) an appreciation of the Governments assistance in appointing a director, and of the help it had given in. the pioneering-work, bringing about the necessary closer cohesion of the various industrial interests, essential to the main objects of the scheme, namely, the complete organisation of commerce and industry so as effectively to meet post-war conditions. Mr. Owen Cox, representing the shipping interests, said that fears of undue Government interference had been dissipated. He thought that considerable benefit could not fail to accrue from the scheme. Dr. Gellatly, Director of Science and Industry, stated that much scientific work had already been done under the cegis of the adviser to the Council whom Mr. Hughes appointed two years ago. The maturing period for yeast had beeu reduced to 5J hours, probably solving the day-baking problem. Mangrove bark had proved a suitable substitute for wattle bark, meaning a reduction of 40 per cent, in the cost of tanning. The Committee investigating alcohol fuel for engines had discovered a new denaturient to replace the one used which was now almost unobtainable. Another Committee had drawn up plans for a mechanical cotton picker.Perpetuating A.I.F. Units. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), explaining the Defence Departments system for perpetuating the traditions established by A.I.F. units, said that individual members would&apos;receive discharges, but the units would not disband. The members could remain on the rolls as honorary members on easy conditions. The Department was now enrolling returned soldiers in the Army Reserve. They would be posted after the war to their old units. &quot; All efforts must aim,&quot; he said, &quot; at the perpetuation of honourable traditions which have cost us so much, and &quot;at keeping before the eyes of the younger generation the glorious ideals of men who have sacrificed themselves for their country.&quot;NEW ZEALAND.Population of the Dominion. The population of the Dominion (exclusive of Maoris and residents of Cook Islands) as at March 31st, 1918, is given in the last published monthly abstract of the Government statistician as 1,104,783, of whom 512,096 were males and 562,687 were females. If 49,776 Maoris and 12,797 residents of Cook and other Pacific Islands are included, the estimated population on the date mentioned reaches the total of 1.167,356.SOUTH AFRICA.General Botha on Peace without Victory. The Prime Minister (General Botha) sent the following message on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the declaration of war, to the people&apos;of the Union : -&quot; To-morrow we enter upon the fifth year of this terrible world war, and we must continue our efforts with that unfailing energy and courage so necessary for complete victory, the only conclusion that can bring about a world peace. We have clear proof before us that peace without victoiy would, bo disastrous and would only result in preparation for an even more appalling struggle. Let every man and woman in South Africa do his or her duty with unfaltering determination to obtain that end so necessary for lasting peace.&quot;The Fourth Anniversary of the War. -The fourth anniversary of the declaration-of war Avas commemorated at the principal centres in the Union. According to a Renter message, church services and civic and religious gatherings were crowded. A number of members of the Cabinet w^ere present at a gathering in Church Square, Pretoria. The Minister of Justice (Mr. Nicolaas De Wet), speaking in Johannesburg Town Hall, said that South Africa had this message, viz. :  &quot; This is a
time for faith as well as faithfulness faith in the cause and faith that in God&apos;s good time we will win our righteous cause.&quot;Mr. Malan on the British Connection.-In a recent speech at Vryheid, the Minister of Mines, Industries and Education (Mr. F. S. Maian), referring to the charge of &quot; imperialism &quot; brought against the Premier (General Botha), asked what was the gravamen of the charge ? It was, he said, that the Government was true to the British connection, and he continued: &quot; The attitude which I think true South Africans should take up is this; we claim the rights which  British citizenship gives us. We accepted a free constitution which was drawn up by ourselves and which we asked the British Parliament to bestow on us. We claim those rights and elect our own members of parliament. If we utilise those rights given us by our constitution, rights of free speech, equality of language and a free parliament to govern South Africa according to the wishes of theL majority of the people of this country, then I say it is no more than right that we should be true to-our obligations which go with those rights. And more than that, to the Dutch-speaking South Africans I would say : &apos; It is to your advantage to he honest.&apos; &quot;Nationalist Conference Resolution. A Renter message from Bloemfontein, dated August 8th, states that the Conference of Central Committees of Nationalist Parties of the four Provinces of the Union has adopted the following Resolution: &quot; This Conference, being sensible of the earnest&quot; desire among our people for independence, and having taken cognizance of the publicly stated objects of the war and the pronouncements made in the name of the Allies and the United States, particularly by Mr. Lloyd George, Premier of England, and Mr. Wood row Wilson, President of the United States, that all violations of right and freedom must be repaired, that all nationalities must have the right to decide their own destiny, and that no people must ever be compelled to remain under a sovereignty under which it does not desire to live, and being convinced that these objects and pronouncements are in accord with the eternal principles of right and justice, expresses its full and enthusiastic agreement therewith.&quot; In view of our history and also our inherent right as a distinct people no longer in its infancy, it demands that these axiomatic principles be applied to South Africa, so that complete freedom and independence, including the right to determine the form of its own government, be put within the reach of this country.&quot; It therefore resolves to request the Central Committees of the Nationalist Party to take the necessary steps to secure by constitutional means the application to South Africa of the above-mentioned principles of right and freedom.&quot;Campaign in Free State Province. It is reported from Cape Town that the indisposition of General Botha has necessitated the postponement of his visit to the Orange Free State Province for the forthcoming Ministerial Campaign.INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Recruiting Progress. Although the returns are incomplete, a Press cable from Simla of some days age announces that recruiting in July exceeded the record figures of June. It is stated that a gratifying feature of the N.W. Frontier Province is the substantial manner in which men have come forward to enlist.Constitutional Reforms. It is officially reported, that political interest has been confined almost entirely to the discussion of the Report on Constitutional Reforms and to the Rowlatt Committee Report which was published on July 19th.Iu a recent public statement, Mr. Gandhi, commenting on the Reform Scheme, said that as an artistic production the scheme is superior to the Congress-League -Scheme, and deserves sympathetic handling rather than summary rejection, but it must be considerably improved before it is accepted by Indian reformers, whose -standard of judgment must be the Congress-League Scheme, crude though that be. Reformers, he says, should vehemently press for the incorporation of the essentials of the Congress Scheme in the Montagu scheme.Comments in the Press indicate the expectation that an opportunity will be ^ivcn at the meeting of the Imperial Legislative Council in September for non-official
members to record their opinion of the Constitutional Reform Scheme. It is stated that various Home Riders, being apprehensive of isolation from the moderates, are now suggesting a union for the purpose of amending the scheme.The position of the non-Brahmin Hindus under the proposed new Indian electorates was discussed recently in a letter to The Times (London) by Lord Sydenhain. After pointing out that there is a possibility oE the working classes of India having no representation unless communal representation &apos;is given to them, Lord Sydenham submits that this is a most important question of principle which ought not to be left to the unfettered decision of a Committee whose Chairman is to know nothing of India. The writer points out thai &quot; the population of Madras Presidency is about 41 millions, including lj million Brahmins, 11 million Indian Christians, and 35 million non-Brahmin Hindus. The Indian Christians secure no seat in the Legislative Council; the non-Brahmins hold one seat; the little Brahmin minority is in possession of 10 seats. As the Brahmins, in addition, have an immense preponderance of Government offices, they can, by methods they well understand, wield a powerful influence at elections and in most other ways over the lower castes. The Brahmins of India number about, S per cent, of the population, and the non-Brahmin Hindus the vast majority of the population are at present practically disfranchised. If de-mocracy is to be anything more than a political catchword in India, communal representation, which the Report rejects, must be adopted. A Brahmin cannot in any sense represent the lower castes, for reasons which date back to the period before the time of Maun.&quot; .FOREIGN COLONIES.GERMAN COLONIES.Neutral View of Great Britain&apos;s Attitude. German Wireless reports that under the heading &quot; War Aims &quot; the Christiania Daghladet of August 4th contains the following: &quot; Great Britain has not made known her attitude towards the question of the German Colonies. Reports are received from South Africa and Australia that the German Colonies are never to be restored, without any indication that there is to be any compensation. They intend to defeat Germany&apos;s attempt to found a world dominion, but they are just as determined to maintain their own. If a world league is founded and a league of peace develops out of it, the Entente must not only demand justice but must also put justice in practice. It is superfluous that England should possess a series of fortresses and naval bases all over the world, if it is her intention that the freedom of the seas and of commerce shall be extended not only to the subjects of His Britannic Majesty, but also to other people. Under other circumstances it may have been, in a certain measure, a necessity for England to dominate the Straits of Gibraltar. Every ground for this permanent injury to Spain&apos;s rights and to her feelings will be removed if the world lives in peace, and the nations form that league of which Mr. Lloyd George is at present a supporter.&quot;Control of Raw Materials. Professor Schumacher of the University of Bonn has an illuminating article in the Vienna, Ncue Freie duress which indicates the German fear of the British economic weapon in relation to the supply of raw materials. He -writes : &quot; Independently of all political factors, private measures can secure the control over raw materials and this in two ways. In the first place, one acquires raw materials by all lawful measures, whether by firm purchase or by securing options. To what extent this has been done cannot be seen quite clearly. But it has become known, for example, that England has bought up the wool shearings in Australia and Hew Zealand for 12 months after the war, and is pursuing similar aims in South Africa ; that she has taken similar measures concerning oil fruits of every kind ; and that she has provided against any sale to enemy countries of all non-ferrous ores from all mines in which Englishmen are interested. A similar control is aimed at over jute and cotton.&quot; Professor Schumacher refers to various other practical disabilities which are gradually being built up against the Germans, and declares that it would be folly to underestimate the enemy &quot; will to war &quot; in the economic sphere, as the Germans did at the beginning of the present war. He says that the only thing for the Germans to do is to go on asserting their readiness to return to the old conditions of vorid-trade, but at the same time to plan a counter-blow to meet every enemy blow.
