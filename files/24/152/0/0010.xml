SECRET.APPRECIATION OE THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT.No. 85.PART I.   BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The statement of the Dominion Minister of Naval Service as to the future naval policy of Canada is important. It is clear that the Minister wishes to see a Canadian unit of an Imperial Eleet, and desires that this unit should be under the entire control of the Dominion in time of peace, and that in war it should pass under Imperial control. A general statement to this effect on behalf of the Government may be expected before long, and it will be interesting to see how the Dominion authorities propose to meet the problem of peace distribution, so that the single authority which, it is recognised, must be responsible for the conduct of war may also be responsible for the no less important task of the peace disposition of naval force, in accordance with the requirements of the international situation.The Prime Minister s appeal to the working men of the Dominion incidentally shows how much Canadian labour has contributed to the Military Forces.The Government control of the export of wheat is an interesting development, and provides one more example of State control of national industrial effort.The scheme for the industrial re-education of wounded soldiers aims at fitting a man as speedily as possible for a return to civil life as an independent, wage-earner.Other items which should receive attention in this Report relate to railway policy, to the supervision and direction of the Canadian steel industry, and to the Dominion&apos;s achievements in food production.Australian Com m on wealth.The latest cables from the Commonwealth confirm the information given in the last Report as-to the breach between the Official Labour Party and the New South Wales Labour Members in the Commonwealth Parliament. The manifesto of the latter is of particular interest, for the signatories clearly see that to make participation in recruiting conditional upon a peace involving no annexations and no indemnities, would mean that the Official Labour Party would desert their men at the Front and take no further part in the war. Sooner or later it was inevitable that the more patriotic element in the Official Labour Party should dissociate themselves from those who sought to put a drag upon war effort, and the action of the New South Wales members, some of whom have seen the conditions of the war in France, may lead to important results in federal politics.The action of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council regarding shipbuilding agree-meuts is not of great significance, for, though that Council may not have approved of the agreements, the fact remains that the great majority of representatives of the Federated Unions^ did approve. -The arbitration award, which will not permit of piecework in shipbuilding, may be inconvenient to the Government, but will not, it may
2be confidently assumed, cause them to abandon their ship construction policy. Legislation to meet the situation will be introduced during- the coming session.. South -Africa.-The objections to the removal of German women and children from East Africa to Union territory were pointed out by the South African Ministers some time ago, and were mainly based upon political considerations, for the Nationalists, no doubt, would have made.much of a &quot;concentration camp&quot; in the Free State Province. But considerations of humanity have now caused the Union Ministers to suggest to the British Government that the women and children should be removed to the South-Yvest Protectorate.The information regarding the employment of South African capital in financing industrial undertakings is important, and indicates a phase of development which has been long advocated by some Members of the Union Parliament.It is well that one of the Union Ministers should have emphasised the fact of the non-interference of the British Government in South Africa&apos;s internal affairs.The industrial situation on the Rand requires careful watching, and may at any time occasion renewed anxiety.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The meeting of the Bombay National Congress has served to bring into still further relief the division between the two parties of Extremists and Moderates. Owing to the abstention of the leading Moderates from the Congress, the gathering has been robbed of most of the men of any weight or political judgment. As&quot; anticipated, the Congress proceeded to pass Resolutions which, while purporting to improve the Reform Scheme, would have the effect, if: adopted, of destroying it altogether.Some further evidence as to the non-Brahmin attitude upon communal represen-tation is given in this Report.The Debate in the Legislative Assembly on Constitutional Peforms is of special interest and indicates a resolute stand by the Moderates in favour of the Reform Scheme.Foreign Colonies.Evidence of the organised campaign in Germany in favour of the retention of the Colonies, to which attention was called last week, is further emphasised by the messages of various prominent men in Germany. Count Hertling even goes so far as to convey the suggestion that the real reason for the continuance of the war is the desire to possess -the German Colonies. The importance of the Colonies as a field for the srrpply of raw material is obviously considered the most effective method of appealing to the German public, who have been told by their leaders during other and more promising times ,of the great moral mission which Germany has to accomplish in the heart of Africa.11. d&apos;E.September 12th, 1918.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Dominion Naval Policy.-In the course of an informal address to the &quot;Sons of Empire &quot; at Montreal last week, the Dominion Minister of Naval Service (Mr. CO. Ballantyne) indicated his belief and hope that in the near future Canada would have a strong, sound naval policy of her own. His vision was of a Canadian Fleet which would form part and parcel of the Imperial Fleet, but at &quot;the same time it would be . Canacla&apos;s &quot;unit and under the absolute control of Canada, except in time of war when it would pass under a single united command. The Minister added, &quot;This is as far as I may go until the Government policy is announced.&quot;Labour&apos;s Contribution to the War. In the course of his recent speech (vide Report No. 84), the Prime Minister (Sir Robert borden) made an appeal to the working men of the Dominion, as well as the employers of labour, to work together in closer harmony in order the sooner to effect the defeat of German militarism. He pointed out the fact that more than 227,000 out of approximately 365,000 soldiers sent overseas by Canada up to the end of March last are classed as working men. &quot;These figures,&quot; declared Sir Robert, &quot; speak more eloquently than any words could utter of the devotion, the ideals and the patriotism of Canadian labour.&quot;Government Control of Wheat Export. The Government of the Dominion have taken over the complete control of the purchase, distribution, and routing of the Canadian export of wheat, from the Great Lakes to the seaboard.. Under the new arrangement centralisation and organisation are retained and strengthened, and it is believed that prompt movements of grain for export will be facilitated. The purchase of grain for export and internal use will be thrown open to dealers and shippers as before the war, subject to supervision and control by the Government, instead of being carried out through a wheat export company as formerly. The Government guarantee the purchase of all surplus merchantable wheat raised in Canada this year at the present fixed price of the commodity. They will also attend to the apportionment of the grain mills of the Dominion as well as control all freight and lake tonnage allotments. The Board of Grain Supervisors of Canada, members of which represent the producers, shippers, and consumers, will be entrusted by the Government with carrying out the new arrangements, and will be given the necessary powers to do so.Base for Siberian Troops. The City of Victoria, B.C., has been chosen as the concentration base for troops mobilising in Canada for service in Siberia, according to a notification received by Major-General Leckie. The location of the camp is not yet decided upon.Women s Aid Department. Arrangements are being completed by the Militia Department for the organisation of a Women&apos;s Aid Department in Canada along lines similar to the W.A.A.C. organisation in England. An official announcement gbving the details of the establishment will be made shortly.Railway Policy. The Dominion Minister of Railways (Dr. J. D. Eeicl) in the course of an interview accorded to the Press has stated that within a few days an Order-in-Couhcil will be passed incorporating the National Transcontinental/ the Intercolonial, and the Canadian Northern Railways, with, their various branches, into one system with a single directorate. The Government have men in view for the reorganised directorate and every effort is being made to keep the system absolutely free frOm politics. Sir William Mackenzie and Sir Donald. Mann have resigned from the Canadian Northern Railway board together with all the other directors except three, wdio will form a quorum pending reorganisation.
oSteel Industry : Powers of War Trade Board. An important Order-in-Council lias been passed giving the Canada War Trade Board an extension of their power of supervision and direction of the Canadian steel industry. This action was taken with a view to co-ordinating the productive,power of the-steel plants, and to securing the greatest possible efficiency. The Board is empowered to direct each company as to the quantities and the kind of materials they may produce. In future -each plant will probably specialise in particular products. The Order has been rendered necessary owing to the shortage of steel in the United States brought about by the heavy demands for war purposes.Food Exports: Dominion Achievements. Commenting on Canada&apos;s accomplish-ments in the matter of food exports, the Chairman of the Canada Food Board (Mr. H. B. Thomson) states that, in the past year, the Dominion exported for war purposes 125,000,000 lbs. of pork, representing an increase of 570 per cent. Before the war Canada was a heavy importer of butter, but last year, owing to the war economies practised by the public, and to the increased production, the Dominion was able to send 4,000,000 lbs. to help in provisioning the Allies overseas. While Canada in pre-war days raised only enough beef for her own use, she was now exporting enough to feed an army of half a million men.Industrial Re-education of Wounded Soldiers. At the end of July there were in Canada 1,990 returned wounded men taking courses in industrial re-education, while 1,991 were taking courses in curative workshops under the direction of the Department of Soldiers Civil Re-establishment. During that month 314 men completed their course in industrial re-education, and were ready for employment, bringing the total number of gradiiates who have passed through up to 1,08.1. These courses are given to men who are unable to return to their pre-war occupations owing to war disabilities. A man applying for such a course is interviewed by the vocational officer, who is a returned soldier, and who discusses with Rim the most -suitable occupation. &quot;Many men who were unskilled labourers before the war are thus able to obtain through this training some skilled employment. During the course of training the man receives an allowance for himself and his family according to a fixed scale, which depends upon whether he is married or not, and the number of children he has to maintain. The graduation of vocational training does not in any. way interfere with the soldieFs right of pension in proportion to the percentage of -disability fixed by the medical board.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Labour Differences on War Policy. With regard to the recent Resolutions of the Inter-State Labour Conference that a ballot - should be taken of the Unions as to whether further Labour participation in recruiting should be conditional on the Allies -agreeing to a policy of no annexations and no indemnities (vide Report No. 84), the latest telegrams confirm that an open breach has occurred between the Australian -official Labour Party and the New South Wales- Members of the Commonwealth Parliament, notwithstanding the denial by the Leader of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament (Mr. Tudor) that any split has taken place. The differences arose in connection with the distribution of the papers among the affiliated Labour Leagues and Unions advocating a &quot;Yes1&apos;vote on the Conference Resolutions, whereas the manifesto of the New South Wales members urged unionists to vote &quot; No.&quot; Amongst the signatories to this manifesto are the former secretary of the official Labour Party (Mr. D. Wat-kins) and Senator Gardiner, who held Cabinet office as Vice-President, of the Executive Council in the Labour administration of Mr. Hughes, prior to the formation of the National Party. The text-of the manifesto is now available, and is as follows : &quot; At the election of 1914, the Labour Party issued a manifesto pledging the move-ment to participate in a vigorous prosecution of the war and Labour obtained a big majority.   Since then an election and. referendums on conscription have been held, -and in each campaign the movement has stood firmly by the voluntary system and repeated its pledge to continue its efforts to cany on the war until a just  and
Honourable peace bad been achieved. This attitude lias clone much to defeat conscription, and to vote &apos; Yes&apos; to this question would give the Government the-alternative of introducing conscription by regulation or- statute law. To abandon voluntary enlistment now would mean pulling out of the Avar and leaving those trade-unionists who are in the trenches without the help we should give them. Pulling out of the war would mean the stoppage of munition factories, stoppage of shipbuilding,, holding.up of food supplies, and withholding the money necessary to &quot;keep our troops-in the battle zone and for their -return to Australia. It is our proud boast that two-thirds of the men in the Australian Imperial Force are unionists, thousands of whom were induced to enlist in consequence of Labour-s war policy. Thousands have been killed or maimed, and thousands are still fighting. The proposal you are asked to-adopt may be interpreted to mean that as a party we shall take no further part in the-war. This would be a distinct breach of faith with the electors and a base desertion, of our soldiers. Such a step would be disastrous to the movement at a time when all should aim at solidarity and the closing up of our ranks to make a united effort to secure the reins of Government, in both Federal and State Parliaments, in order to protect the interests of the. people in the very serious industrial and financial problems arising after the war. The policy of the movement is that the-platform pledges given to the electors during the election shall be adhered to at- this-critical juncture. In order to protect the best interests of Labour, we earnestly ask you to vote &apos; No.&apos; &quot;It is stated in the Australian Press that several Labour Members attending the-Federal Parliamentary Rooms commended the course taken by the New South Wales members and that/a number of official Labour, members of the Commonwealth Parliament have approved the above-mentioned manifesto.There is no doubt that Labour circles are much disturbed by the differences-over the recruiting ballot.   The Premier of Queensland (Mr Ryan), who attended the-. Perth Conference, is reticent regarding the division of opinion, but made the significant -remark, &quot; The times ahead of the Labour movement in Australia are such that they will require all the solidarity it is possible to maintain.&quot;The Australian Press reports that strenuous efforts are being made by members of the official Labour Party to avert a split on the recruiting cpiestion. Nothing-decisive is expected until after the result of the ballot on November 14th. A special meeting of the Executive of the Australian Labour Party is being held in Sydney,on September 11th. Mr. Evans, the Secretary, stated last week that several Federal Labour members of Parliament, who were members of the Executive, recognised the-constitutional rights of the members to set out their case, but regret was expressed at the publication of the circular owing to the alleged fact that the law prevented an adequate reply.Shipbuilding Agreements. A motion favouring the repudiation of the shipbuilding-agreements between the Federal Government and the Industrial Unions was proposed at a meeting of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council on September 6th by the Amalgamated Carpenters&apos; delegate. The motion was ruled out of order on the ground that as the Council had never officially approved of the agreements it would be irregular to repudiate them.The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), referring to Mr. Justice Higgins&apos; award in the shipbuilding case, said that the Government intended to introduce legislation at the early approaching sitting of Parliament to give effect to the agreement which was signed by 31 Unions. The Government was not deterred in the prosecution of its shipbuilding policy by this verdict, but would pursue its own methods to give effect to it.British Soldiers and Gallipoli Sta.r.- The President of the Returned Soldiers&apos; Association (Lieutenant Mackenzie) favours the British soldiers&apos; claim for,inclusion in the issue of the GaUipoli Star. He states that whatever honour the Australians-earned at Gallipoli is equally due to the brave men from other parts of the Empire who shared the clanger and sufferings of the landing and fighting. He feels sure he-voices the feelings of all Anzacs.The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) in an interview, points out that the Star is the gift of the King, and. the question of who should receive it is entirely for His Majesty to decide.
Death of Lord Eorrest.-The Commonwealth Government have received advice by cable that Lord Forrest died at sea on September 4th. Flags were flown at half mast and the news caused widespread regret.Butter and Cheese Pool. The Assistant Minister (Mr. Massey Greene) dealing with food matters has explained to the Jnter-State Conference and to representatives of the butter arid cheese producers, the Government scheme for pooling butter and cheese.   The chief features are     (1) All butter and cheese should be commandeered on the factory floor; (2) the appointment of a Board of Control with statutory managerial powers consisting of the Minister with three Government nominees and five or eight representatives of the producers elected on a franchise of one factory one vote ; (3) all existing channels of trade to be continued, the traders acting as corn-mission agents for the pool; (4) West Australia to be excluded from the pool. Mr. Greene explained that the scheme was contingent on Mr. Hughes successfully concluding negotiations with the British Government for the sale of the seasoms surplus butter.   He felt he would be justified in stating from the latest indications that Mr. Hughes would succeed.SOUTH AFRICA.Removal of Germans from. Last Africa,. The Union Government have informed the British Government that General Van Deventer has urgently requested them to allow, on grounds of humanity, German women and children, whose retention in East Africa is dangerous to health, to reside in the South-West Protectorate or the Union. For reasons already given (vide Report in o. 45), the Union Government do not approve of receiving the women and children in the Union, but on reconsideration the Ministers see no serious difficulty to their being accommodated in South-West Africa. This view is also adopted by the Administrator of the Protectorate, Avho who states that the Germans in that territory have an organisation ready to receive the persons in question. The Union Government, therefore, ask the British authorities if they agree to the removal of the women and children to South-West Africa.Employment of Capital.- In reference to the speech at Johannesburg on August 31st of Mr. F. S. Malan, who forecasted an early announcement as to the arrangements which had been come to with prominent fmancers for organising the use of South Africa&apos;s plethora of capital (vide Report No. 84), Renter&apos;s representative in Pretoria has been officially informed that the National Bank of South Africa has arranged to form a corporation, with very considerable resources, with the object of financing and fostering industrial undertakings in Africa. The details will be publicly communicated in the near future.Minister and Nationalist Doctrines. The Minister of Posts (Sir M. Beck) In the course of a recent speech at Porterville (Cape Province) combated Nationalist Anti-Imperialist doctrines. According to a Renter message he emphasised the fact that the Imperial Government never interfered in South Africa&apos;s internal affairs and instanced the Indian grievances. After recording a vote of &apos;: no confidence &quot; in the Government, the Nationalists left the Hall. The meeting then passed a resolution unanimously expressing great gratification at the Allies&apos; recent successes and the hope that the &quot;Allies Avould quickly bring the war to a successful conclusion. A meeting at Piquetberg at which Nationalists were present passed a similar resolution.Chamber of Commerce and Wool Clip. At a, recent meeting of the South African section of the London Chamber of Commerce the Chairman pointed out that the Conference summoned at Pretoria for October 16th was far too late in the season to be of practical value. The meeting resolved to cable to the Union Government urging them to advise the farmers to accept any Imperial Government offer to buy the forthcoming clip on the same terms as had been offered to Australia and New Zealand.The Industrial Situation on the Rand. The industrial situation on the Rand is again causing anxiety, the Central District Committee of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers demanding a wage of 162s. weekly, which is equal to that which the Municipal employees obtained as the result of the May strike. The masters are unanimously resisting the demand.   The ironmoulders are at present on strike.
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Bombay National Congress: the Two Parties.-The adhesion of the &quot; Servants of India &quot; Society to the Moderate Party and the decision to attend the Moderate Conference instead of the National Congress appears to have caused considerable annoyance to the Extremists. According to Press reports, however, the latter made a further attempt to bring in the Moderates by inviting them to attend a joint Conference, and for this purpose the Congress date was postponed to August 29th. This invitation was refused, the Moderate attitude being shown in Mr. Samarth&apos;s letter to Mrs. Besant, in which the reason for refusal was stated to be that no useful purpose could be served by such a meeting, as there was a radical and fundamental difference between persons who support the scheme and those who condemn it as &quot; unworthy to be offered by England or to be accepted by India.&quot;Correspondence has been published between Mr. Surendranath Banerjee and Mrs. Besant, showing that the former suggested the postponement of the Congress about a month ago in order to prevent a split. Mr. Banerjee said that- compromise was only possible on the basis of the recognition of the reform proposals as a definite step towards responsible government.At the National Congress which met at Bombay on August 29th Press reports state that very few Moderates attended. The correspondent of The Times (London) describes it as &quot;a Congress from which almost all men of weight and authority in Indian politics are abstaining.&quot; hie continues : &quot; The only remedy for this situation is for Parliament resolutely and expeditiously to proceed with its scheme for the development of the Indian Constitution so as to substitute some real responsibility for, the unfettered criticism which is the bane of Indian public life. For the present the situation is not free from progressive dangers. Whilst the Moderates have almost a monopoly of talents and experience in public service, the Extremists have captured the young and enthusiastic.&quot;In his Presidential Address to the National Congress, Mr. Hassan Imam is reported to have said that he knew no Extremists and no Moderates, these names being devised by their enemies to divide the Congress. He defended the system of communal electorates, and criticised details of the reform scheme, notably the Council of State, which he alleged was likeby to create a new class, and thus to bring about a dangerous new division of the people of India. He also criticised the proposed inclusion of Native Princes in the Council of State.At the meeting of the Indian National Congress on September 1st, a Resolution was passed expressing the view that the Reform proposals were disappointing, and suggesting various modifications. Amongst the latter were suggestions (according to a Renter message) that the provincial system of reserved and transferred subjects should also be applicable to the Government of India ; that there should be no Council of State, but that if such a Council were constituted, at least half its members should be elected in the Executive Council, and that at least half the members should be Indians. The Resolution also contained the suggestion that a statutory guarantee should be given that full responsible government should be established within a period not exceeding 15.years. The Resolution also demanded the abolition of the India Council and the appointment of two permanent Uncler-Secretaries, one of whom should be an Indian.Amongst the other Resolutions passed were those claiming that equal franchise rights should be extended to women; that the proportion of Indians in the Civil Seiwiee should be 50 per cent., and that the number of Army commissions granted to Indians should be increased by at least 25 per cent., and later to 50 per cent.The All-India Moslem League have adopted a Resolution regarding the Reforms on similar lines to the Congress Resolution, and a Press Report states that Sir Fazulbhoy Currimbhoy, the Chairman of the Reception Committee of the League, has stated that the Reform Scheme showed a gratuitous want of confidence and distrust of representative assemblies and individual Indians.Non-Brahmins and Communal Representation. Dr. Nair has received the following telegrams from India on the question of communal representation under the reform scheme : &apos;&quot; Nepaui, September 3rd.-Nepani non-Brahmins support you as All-India leader to press communal representation to success. -President, public meeting.&quot;
&quot; Madras, September 3rd. South Iudian Liberal Federation, Madras Zemindars, Landholders&apos; Associations, South Indian League, Madras Dravidian Association, Madras Adidravida Jana Sabha urge that Indian experience is absolutely essential in the chairman of the Reform Committee.   Approve appointing Sir John Hewett.&quot;Reform Debate in Legislative Council. The Viceroy has informed the Secretary of State for India that a debate in the Legislative Council on Constitutional Reforms took place on September 9th. Mr. Banerjee, in a restrained but powerful speech, moved a resolution recognising the Reforms Scheme as a definite advance towards the progressive realisation of responsible government, and suggested that a Committee of all non-official members to make recommendations on it should be appointed. His peroration was an impassioned appeal to all Ihdians&quot;to grasp the hand of fellowship extended to them. The debate, in which all non-official members took part, was remarkable for the resolute standing taken by the Moderates, notably Mr. Banerjee, Sir Dinshaw Yvacha, Messrs. Shastri and Sapru, against the Extremists&apos; minority led by Messrs. Jinnah, Patel, Malaviya, and Kaparde, who were, of course, committed by their previous speeches outside. There was substantial acceptance of the scheme throughout the debate except on the part of the Extremists, but there was general criticism regarding the slightness of the changes which were proposed in the, Government of India. *At the end of the debate, Sir William Vincent made a point which was well received on all sides, by affirming that the scheme would be loyally accepted by the Indian Civil Service, who would co-operate with Indians whole-heartedly in making it a success as an advance towards the goal of responsible government, and he rebuked insinuations that had been made that they would seek by covert opposition to bring it to failure. On-Sir William. Vincent&apos;s motion, the resolution was split into two parts, with the result that the scheme was declared to be a definite advance by 46 to 2 and referred to Committee by 48 to 2. In the first case the minority consisted of Messrs. Patel and Ayyangar, Messrs. Jinnah, Sarna and other Extremists abstaining. In the second case, Messrs. Hogg and Ironside, of the Bombay and Bengal Chambers of Commerce, formed the minority. They stood out of Committee notwithstanding an appeal from Mr. Banerjee for co-operation and remarks by Sir William Vincent that this was the time for those who thought their interests endangered to champion them in Conference.FOREIGN  COLONIES.GERMAN COLONIES.Campaign for Retention of the Colonies. The British Minister at The Hague has called the attention of the Foreign Office to the campaign which is now being carried on in the German Press in favour of the retention of the German Colonies. He points out that in order to help this campaign autograph letters have appeared in facsimile from the-Crown Prince, Count Hertling and Generals von Hindenburg and von Ludendorff.The message of the Crown Prince is as follows : -&quot; No word or act of gratitude is sufficiently great or sufficiently proud for.those who, though left to their own resources, defended &apos; Deutschtum &apos; in a far-off part of the world.&quot;Count Hertling says : &quot; Nothing so clearly proves the fact that firmly-established colonial possessions are a vital necessity to Gerrnanj&apos;-, as the strenuous efforts which our enemies, in spite of their immediate distress in Europe, have made to conquer German colonies. Never would they have rtsed the big fighting force now operating there merely for a side issue. They knew and they know that Germany requires the colonies in order to exist, if she is not to be dependent for her future on the arbitrary will of foreign peoples. Every German should see this quite clearly. He will then not be behind-hand in the readiness born of conviction to gladly make sacrifices for Germany&apos;s colonial empire.&quot;
General Hinclenburg writes :--&quot; Without colonies, no certainty of supply of raw materials&quot;; -without raw materials, no industry ; without industry, no adequate welfare.&quot;General Ludendorff writes : &quot; The colonies are inseparable from Germany&apos;s future, for which we &quot;must fight and conquer.&quot;--   Dr.   Solf  appeals  in  the  Norddeutsche Allgemeine Z.zeitung of August 15th for contributions to a fund for the troops in East Africa.   He concludes his article-with an expression of confidence that the people will comply with the appeal, and that the result will prove that they are less willing now than ever to ^relinquish their Colonial future.
