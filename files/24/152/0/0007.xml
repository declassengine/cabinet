SECRET,APPRECIATION OE TEE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 82.PART I.   BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The statement issued by the Labour leaders as a result of a Conference in Toronto is interesting as showing a crystallisation of labour opinion in the Dominion. This has hitherto been somewhat lacking, mainly owing no doubt to the absence of a political Labour Party in Parliament.The figures relating to the reinforcements under the Military Service Act, and the numbers obtained from each of the districts, should-be noted.The process of registration for National Service has resulted in an estimate being formed that the present population of the Dominion is well over eight millions.Amongst other items which deserve attention are those referring to the maim-facture of shells and aeroplanes, and the wheat crop.Australian Commonwealth.The paragraph relating to the Air Service will be read with interest, more especially having regard to the statement in last week&apos;s Report concerning the formation of a Canadian Air. Force.The statement of the Acting Prime Minister regarding the cost of the war and the financial position of the Commonwealth is of importance. The desire, of Australia to shoulder the full financial responsibility cast upon her by the war is characteristic of the strong national feeling in the Commonwealth.The scheme of the Sydney Trade Pinion Congress for the formation of an Industrial Union of/Australia is a significant development. The purpose is no doubt-to insure combined action in critical industrial situations.-Some points of interest as to the attitude of Trade Unions in New South Wales towards the war.are given in this Report. The criticism of the Labour Party as given in a published speech of Mr. Plohnan represents, of course, only one side of the matter. It must not be forgotten that the official Labour Party strongly protest against being identified with the I.W.W., and they constant!y assert that they are as anxious to win the war as their opponents in Parliament.[i\T.o.
Sooth Africa.The Ministerial campaign in the Free State Province has naturally lost a good deal of its force through the unfortunate absence of General Botha. Though, as was to be expected, anti-Government Resolutions have been carried at the Ministerial meetings, yet the attention paid to the Ministers has been on the whole satisfactory. Naturally the Government action regarding the sale of the wool clip was dealt with pretty ftdly, and apparently effectively, by the Ministers, and /it will be difficult for further party capital to be extracted Rom this source by the Nationalists. The views of Herr von Lindequist seem to have come in as useful propaganda, and may do something, if such is possible, to influence the extremists, who object even to refer to the Germans as enemies. As the Gape Times puts it, the tour will probably yield good results, though these may not be immediatelj&apos; apparent.The proposal of the Union Government for establishing a training school for aviation will be read with interest.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The decision of the Moderate Party to withdraw from the National Congress and to hold an All-India Conference of their own has apparently given rise to a good deal of anxiety amongst the extremists, who hoped to overwhelm the Moderates at the Congress., It should be noted that the Madras Provincial Conference Committee has demanded the right of political deputations to come to England to educate the British public on Indian aspirations.In connection with the paragraph relating to &quot; Indian Nationalists &quot; in Europe, it should be remembered that this European Committee is a subsidised German organisation in Berlin, and is in no sense representative of any responsible opinion in India.H. d&apos;E.August 22nd, 1918.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Labour and the War. As a result of a Conference between Labour leaders in Toronto, a statement lias been issued explaining, the attitude of Labour towards the war. This states that the Labour Party ardently and consistently support the war, their view being based on the belief that Avhile Labour interests are peculiar to theni-selves, they recognise that - if ruthlessness, terrorism and militarism were to iriumph, the catise of Labour would be set back a century. The statement also announces the after-war policy of the party, declaring that immigration to Canada should cease until the soldiers are back in industrial life, and that preference should then be given to the Allies.   It further declares that Labour wants a &quot; white &quot; Canada.Reinforcements under Military Service Act. Investigations are now in progress by the various registrars to determine exactly how many men have been secured who can properly be classed as &quot; reinforcements &quot; within the meaning of the Act. Present returns show that the net number of reinforcements secured by the Act is 59,713, exclusive of those who have reported for service voluntarily since the Act came into force. The total does not include men discharged or on leave without expense to the general public.The districts from which the men were obtained is shown, in the following table : West of Great Lakes - - -   22,496Ontario        - - -   19,734Quebec - - - -     9,387Maritime Provinces - - -     8,106If those who have reported and have since been voluntarily discharged, or are on leave without expense to the public are included, the total number of men obtained is 102,713, comprised as follows : Obtained under Military Service Act  - -   59,713Voluntarily reported     - 19,477Discharged or on leave       - - -   23,523Expedition to Siberia.-A scjuadron of cavalry which will be furnished by the Royal North-West Mounted Police will form part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force to Siberia. &quot;Details as to the composition of the force are not yet announced, but it is hoped to make the expedition entirely self-contained, with its own medical and auxiliary units.Registration for National Service. On June 22nd a total of 4,811,640 persons over 16 years of age were registered for National Service in Canada. This excludes returns which, have not yet been received from a few districts in the Northern parts of the Western Provinces. It is expected that the final total will be well over 5,000,000. All persons registered were required to state whether they were willing to undertake agricultural work, instead of their present occupation. As a result, 167,273 male workers were secured, and placed at the disposal of the various organisations dealing with the problem of farm labour in the various provinces.population of the Dominion. In view of the figure of 4,811,640 persons of over 16 years of age, which is given in the preceding paragraph, and of the fact that the last Census (l9ll) showed that 40 per cent, of the population of Canada were under 16 years of age, calculations indicate that the present population of the Dominion is well over 8 millions, exclusive of those now oversea.
Revenue of the Dominion. The total revenue of the Dominion Government from April 1st to July 31st, 1918, amounted to 91,954,000 dollars from all sources, an increase of nearly 9,000,000 dollars over the corresponding period of last year. This increase of revenue has been achieved in spite of the fall in customs-receipts due to the restricted imports and the lack of shipping facilities.Crop of Oats and Wheat. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics has issued a crop report compiled from reports of correspondents made to the end of July. Figures covering conditions in the whole of Canada indicate a total yield for 1918 of nearly 232,000,000 bushels; as compared with 233,742,850 bushels in 1917. The total yield of oats will be about 416,000,000 bushels as against 403,000,000 in 1917. The wheat yield in the three Prairie Provinces indicated bv conditions is 216,488,000 and oats 254,930,000 bushels.Manufacture of Shells and Aeroplanes. According to information made public by the Imperial Munitions Board, 215,000 persons are engaged in the manufacture of shells in the Dominion, and of this number 5,000 are women. Under the direction of this Board, Canada has produced 2,000 aeroplanes since manufacturing was commenced, the factoiy in which these machines are made employing 2,150 men and women. The present output of the plant is equal to 350 machines a month. The factory is now engaged in constructing bombing &apos;planes for the United States Navy.Victory War Bonds. The selling price of Canadian Victory Bonds has been advanced once more, the War Loan Committee having fixed it at $100 or par. The demand for securities is so persistent and heavy that the Committee have decided that a further increase in the price is warranted. The bonds at the new level are 1-J- points above the issue price. The Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) has issued a statement explaining why the Dominion War Loans are not subject to taxation, and he declares that the present is no time to make a change in War Loan policy. He believes that lower interest charges will ultimately be highly important to Canadian finance.AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.Australian Flying Corps. In connection with developments in aviation matters recently recorded in relation to other Dominions, the following facts are given con-cerning the Australian Flying Corps. The inauguration of the Australian Flying Corps took -place before August 1914, when, according to the policy laid down by the Commonwealth Government, the Australian Flying Corps was formed to co-operate in the scheme of National Defence, and a frying school and training &quot;ground for pilots was established on the AVerribee Plains, at Laverton, Victoria.On the outbreak of war in August 1914, the Commonwealth of Australia imme-cliately offered to the Government of India a detached flight consisting of four officers and 41 others ranks for service with the Mesopotamian Campaign. This flight was in command of Captain (now Major) Petre, D.S.O., M.C., who took part in the unsuccessful effort to relieve General Townsend when besieged in Ivut.The formation of the Australian Flying Corps for service.. abroad with the Australian Imperial Force, dates from the time when the then established Flying . School had trained a sufficient number of pilots to constitute a squadron, which unit left Australia on March 16th, 1916, and arrivecl in Egypt April 14th, 1916. This squadron, designated. No. 1 Squadron, A.F.C., has performed valuable service in the Palestine, El Kantara, and Senussi campaigns.It may be mentioned that every unit of the Australian Flying Corps is composed entirely of Australians both in flying officers and mechanics. As a tribute to the skiU and work of the air mechanics, it may be observed that the percentage lost of available time for flying, through having to return from patrol on account of failure of engines, is at a minimum.The present strength of the Corps is about 600 officers, 150 officer cadets, and approximately. 2,500 other ranks.The whole cost of the Australian Flying Corps is borne, by the Commonwealth Government, and all appointments and promotions of officers are also made by that ^Government without reference to the Air Ministry, the power to make appointments
and promotions outside Australia having been delegated by the Commonwealth Government to the General Officer Commanding the Australian..Imperial Force abroad. -The Australian Flying Corps consists of one squadron in Egypt, three squadrons in France, and the usual training squadrons and wing headquarters in England. The pilots were, up till recently, trained by the Royal Air Force, but on the formation of the training squadrons in England the training of the pilots is now carried out solely with those squadrons.Seventh War Loan : Financial Position. -The prospectus of the Seventh Com-commonwealth War Loan for 40,000,000/,, payable September loth, 1923, interest at 5 per cent., has been issued. Applications are to close on October 15th. Interest is subject to Commonwealth taxation, but free of State income tax.The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), in a statement regarding the Seventh. War Loan, said the annual cost of the war to Australia was about 80,000,0001.   The Government asked the people to subscribe 40,000,000/. each six months.   The War Loans raised in Australia total 149,000,000/.In addition the Commonwealth had borrowed from the British Government 47,500,0001. for war purposes, and also owed Britain on June 30th 38,000,000/. for the maintenance of Australian troops and the supply of munitions.Before the sixth war loan was raised, Mr. Watt observes, Australia was not meeting the full financial obligations cast upon her by the war. She was leaning upon the British Government, which, apart from Australian requirements, was bearing a staggering financial load.In her magnificent response to the last w-ar loan, Australia, Mr. Watt declares, &quot;showed her determination to bear her own burden, and the Government now trust that the self-respect of Australia will be maintained by liberal subscriptions to the present loan. By so doing, Australia will uphold the reputation of the people in this isolated and debtor country, and she will be able, when war ends, to assume her -proper place in the financial markets of the world.&quot;Labour Position. The Trades Union Congress in Sydney has passed a resolution in favour of the formation by workers of an Industrial Union of Australia, to be managed by a Grand Council, consisting of two delegates from each of six departments. A further Congress is to be convened in September at Melbourne, for launching the scheme.The Congress has appointed, according to a statement appearing in the Press, an organising Committee representing 12 Unions, with 73,000 workers, to endeavour to bring about a fusion of Unions.As to the attitude of the Trade Unions in New South Wales in relation to the war, leaders of the Official Labour Party claim that the position of the Unions is sound. As an example of this contention the large coaling centre of Newcastle (N.S.W.) was recently quoted, and it was claimed that this electorate, consisting-mostly of a Trade Union population, had invariably excelled in supplying men for the forces and had always been at the head of the list in this regard over all other electorates of the Commonwealth. Indeed, the President of the colliery employees stated a short time ago that 33 per cent, had enlisted from the official roll of their Federation alone, apart altogether from other trades.In touring his constituency last week, the Premier of New South Wales (Mr. W, A. Holman) referred to those who were associated with disloyalty, and stated, according to Press reports, that &quot;the loyal section of labour must consider whether or not it was going hancl-in-hand with the Industrial Workers of the World.&quot; &quot;Labour,&quot; he said, &quot;was divided into two sections one avowedly against the Empire and the Allies, and the other as yet unable to make up its mind where it stood.&quot;Vieios of Returned Soldiers. The Interstate Conference of the Executive of the Returned Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Imperial League has passed the following resolutions :  (1) That the Allies should prosecute the war until complete victory is achieved ; (2) That the secretary of the League&apos;s sub-branch should also be secretary of the Repatriation Committee; (3) That the League is in full sj^mpathy with the Friendly Union of Soldiers&apos; Wives in their projected formation of a trust to ensure scholarships for the children of deceased or disabled soldiers and sailors, and their endeavour to have a uniform scheme throughout the Commonwealth ; (4) That the Government should be approached with a view to increasing the exemption under the Federal Income
Tax Act to 200L per annum in case of unmarried, and 300Z. per annum in the case of married soldiers; (5) That the League heartily approves the suggestion that a separation allowance should be granted to dependants of all non-commissioned officers up to the rank of warrant officers; (0) That no persons not of British or Allied parentage who have not served overseas in this war shall be employed or given any business contract by the Government of Australia.SOUTH AFRICA.Ministerial Campaign in Free State Province. The combined tour of Ministers in the Orange Free State Province opened on August 13th, when on the whole the Government representatives appear to have made some satisfactory progress, according to various messages coming through ReuteFs Agency. It appears that the Nationalists generalR insisted on appointing their own Chairmen and in carrying anti-Government Resolutions, but they seem to have given the Ministers a surprisingly good hearing.On his arrival at Rouxville, the Minister of Mines (Mr. Malan) was met by a large commando on horseback, with motors and carts, outside the town. Mr. Malan rode into the town at the head of the commando, where he was presented with various addresses. Similar cqurtesies were extended to other Ministers, At the public meeting on the show ground the Nationalists insisted on choosing a Chairman, but the Minister was given a hearing for about an hour. He emphasised the fact that England had not forced South Africans to participate in the war. South Africans themselves had confirmed the Governments policy of seeing the war through, and it was the South African Parliament which decided to undertake the campaign in German South-West Africa. If the Nationalists were dissatisfied they had their remedy at the polls. Mr. Malan also strongly defended the Governments attitude on the wool question. He concluded by appealing to the people to use the judgment God had. given them, and hot to follow a policy of prejudice and racial isolation. For an hour and a quarter Mr. Malan answered questions. He was asked, &quot;If Germany wins, what will happen to us ? &quot; He replied, &quot; It is our duty to see that German does not win.&quot; A motion of no confidence in the Government was carried, but by an unexpectedly, small majority, especially as Nationalists had come in from the surrounding districts. A motion approving the Republican movement was also carried amidst Nationalist cheers. - The Minister expressed his appreciation of the excellent way the meeting had been conducted.At a later meeting held at Laclybrand, Mr. Malan secured a very good hearing. At another meeting at Wepener he urged Dutchmen to develop industries throughout the Union. Hitherto, he said, they had always relied on outside people to do so. The Nationalists, he added, always wished to pick the fruits of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson, but they never stirred a finger to assist them to carry out their principles. The Minister concluded by emphatically giving his reasons against Republicanism and insisting that the best policy for the Nationalists was to keep the word given at the Union and honourablj- to  cany out their obligations.The Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Van Heerclen) addressed a crowded meeting in the Town Hail at Bethulie, where again the Nationalists elected a Chairman. Mr. Van Heerden dealt comprehensively with the work of the Parliamentary session, and he aroused the greatest interest when he spoke on the wool question, affirming that the Government had the greatest difficulty in knowing from the wool farmers what they really wanted. Mr. A&quot;an Heerden showed that a vast number of bales of wool were awaiting shipment to-day, and urged the farmers to organise concerning the disposal of the wool. It was a business proposition, he said, and farmers must solve for themselves the question whether they wished to try and sell the wool to the Imperial Government or not. He concluded by urging the Orange Free State Province to remain loyal to the Constitution which had been drawn up by representatives of all the Provinces.Mr. Van Heerden spent an hour and a half in answering questions. He pointed out regarding the wool question that Great Britain and the United States were at war, and the first question was to win the war. As regards Japaits purchases of wool, at present, he said, she was obtaining supplies from Australia. He emphasised the fact that the Government intended to see that, no South African product reached the enemy. Answering questions regarding General Smuts and Mr. Burton being in England, Mr. Van Heerclen affirmed that the South African Parliament was supreme6273-3a B
and was not bound by the decisions of the Imperial War Cabinet. The Minister declared - that he stood firmly, by the Constitution. A motion expressing want of confidence in the Government was carried by 210 votes to 47.A later meeting at Reddersburg, lasting nearly five hours, concluded with a vote of thanks to Mr. Van Heerden, but a vote of no confidence in the Government was carried. Dealing with the wool question, the Minister insisted that it was impossible for the Imperial Government to give a higher price for South African wool than Australian and New Zealand wool, and exhorted his hearers to leave party politics out of the wool question, which was essentially a business affair. Mr. Van Heerden explained that the Government had done their best to procure shipping for wool, and now the farmers must take the initiative. He emphasied the fact that the whole interests of South Africa lay in supporting the Constitution. On referring to the Germans as enemies, the Ministers remarks were met with cries of dissent, where-upon he cited IIerr von Lindequist on German colonies.The Acting Minister of Defence (Colonel Mentz) addressed a large meeting at Frankfort, where he insisted on having his own Chairman. He had an excellent reception, and he nonplussed his audience considerably by the request that if a &quot; no confidence &quot; vote was to be submitted they should let him have an indictment. There being no response to this, the Minister proceeded to refer to the extremely gratifying-news from the Western front. All must realise, he declared, how serious it would be if the Germans won. The war, he added, had benefited South Africans agriculture tremendously a &quot;fact which was clue to the British Fleet. Colonel Mentz strongly detended the Governments attitude in regard to the wool question and denounced those who were trying to keep the Dutch and the British in separate camps. He emphasised the fact that General Hertzog, in the Orange Free State Parliament, had advised the acceptance of the Constitution in the course of a strong speech. In what way, Colonel Mentz asked, had matters altered since then ? The Minister went on to say he had been told that he dared not repeat in the Orange Free State what he had said at Johannesburg-that Boloism was rife on the Rand. Why should he not? he asked. Was Frankfort full, of German spies ? He did not believe it, but the fact remained that Boloism had been rife on the Rand. German money, German agents, German spies had been at wrork and all kinds of trouble had been plotted when the Government stepped in.Colonel Mentz proceeded to urge that, having rights and privileges under the Constitution, South Africa had also her obligations and should remain true and lo3&quot;al to them. He concluded by quoting Herr von Lindequist, former German Colonial Secretary, and said that Germany had clearly planned to use native hordes to beep the Union in check. South Africans, he declared, must stand together and work for the future. They must be careful lest they became the battledore and shuttlecock of the other Powers. If they were not satisfied to-day, let them wait till after the war, when Great Britain&apos;s hands would be free. Let them not avail themselves of Great Britain&apos;s difficulties.   The meeting concluded with a vote of thanks.At a later meeting in Harrismith, Colonel Mentz spoke in English.   A resolu-. tion was unanimously passed urging the grave necessity of German South-West Africa becoming part of the Union, and of German East Africa being retained as British.In an interview, Colonel Mentz said that the general impression was that feeling in the Free State Province generally was very much better than a little while ago.Commenting on the campaign, the Cape Times observes that the meetings in the &apos; Free State Province &quot; seem to show that the Nationalist rank and file, evenin their strong-holds, are desirous of hearing the truth.&quot;- The belief is expressed that the tour will yield good results, though these may not be immediately apparent. &apos;! The educative process is difficult,&quot; the Cape Times adds, &quot;but it is-a hopeful sign that even in the Nationalist stronghold there should have been a considerable -minority which sees clearly enough that the path of prosperity lies along the path of union.&quot;- Training Scliool for Aviation. The Union Government of South Africa have informed the British Government that they propose to establish a Union Training School for Aviation, with the object of training candidates who may volunteer for the Air Service in South Africa and of maintaining such candidates, on behalf of the Imperial authorities, during the period intervening between their engagement and embarkation for European and other theatres of war. It is also intended that the School should provide a depot where the two aeroplanes lately used by Major Miller for recruiting purposes may be kept in readiness for local emergencies. The Union Government point out that, when recruiting men for the Boyal Air Force recently,
discontent arose through the candidates being detained in the Union after their selection until an opportunity for transport to the United Kingdom occurred, and it is felt that the time spent at the depot can be used for certain preliminary preparation which would shorten the period of training in the United Kingdom. For this purpose it is submitted that candidates should be attested in South Africa and given some military status, with the application to them of military law, from the time of their acceptance in the Union. The Union Ministers believe that the adoption of this course would enable recruits to be obtained by a process of regular and continuous enlistment, and that a considerable number of additional candidates of excellent type could be provided &quot;for the Royal Air Force from young men who now hesitate to join direct, and thus commit themselves to leaving South Africa, without previous experience of military life.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Constitutional Reforms. Recent reports in the Press have indicated that strenuotis efforts have been made by the ^extremists to secure the support of the Moderate Party at the forthcoming special meeting of the National Congress at Bombay (vide Report No. SO).Mr. Binocle Mitter, a well-known Bengal lawyer, in writing to the Bengali says it is not clear why Mr. Tilak and Mrs. Besant are so anxious to have the Moderates in the Congress except to overwhelm them by tactics too well known, and then to endeavour to wreck the scheme by pretending that united opinion rejects it. In out-lining the difference between the two Parties, Mr. Mitter says that whilst the Moderates cordially accept the scheme, subject to modifications, the extremists reject the scheme unless complete provincial Home Rule is ^established in five years.The Moderate Party, however, having definitely agreed not to take part in the Congress, have decided themselves to hold an &quot; All-India &quot; Conference of their Party. In explaining this decision, Sir Dinsha Wacha, ex-President and former Secretary of the Congress, has stated that it w-as arrived at owing to the great danger of the Reform Scheme being wrecked by the extremists and by the opposition engineered by the Indo-British Association in London. The Moderate Congress will probably&apos;be held in Calcutta and consist of about 100 substantial and representative people. Owing to the decision of the Moderates to take no part in the Congress, Sir Dinshaw Petit, who had accepted the chairmanship of the Congress Reception Committee, is reported to have withdrawn his acceptance.The Madras Provincial Conference Committee, which was called together to discuss the Reform Scheme, demamfecl, according to published reports of the meeting, the right of political deputations to go to England to educate the British public on Indian aspirations, pending the introduction of the Reform Scheme into the British Parliament. The chief Resolution stated the belief of the Conference that only self-government within the Empire could satisfy the Madras people, and strengthen the connection between England and India. Two Resolutions were submitted to the Conference ; one aiming at various modifications of the scheme and drafted by the organisers of the Conference (including Mrs. Besant), and the other urging the rejection of the scheme, drafted by the more extreme party. After a heated discussion the former Resolution was carried.The Deccan Ryots Association a body founded some two years ago by those who felt the necessity of creating an organisation for the protection of the humbler classes in India forwarded an interesting message recently to Sir Valentine Chirol regarding the important question of communal representation. In the course of this message the following passage occurred : &quot; While recognising the generous measure of power extended to Indians under the proposed scheme and the necessity of restrictions and limitations imposed, the Deccan Ryots Association expresses deep anxiety regarding the constitution of pro-vincial legislatures in the absence of communal representation for backward and depressed classes and minorities, and requests that the Committee on Franchises be given a free hand in sanctioning it wherever necessary. The Committee ought to include at least one non-Brahmin with real sympathies for lower Hindu classes.   The
principle of reservation of seats for minorities in plural constituencies involves similar provision being made for the representation of non-Bralimins in the Bombay Deccan, who, though forming the majority in the aggregate, consist of small disorganised and helpless castes, whose only knowledge of public matters relates to caste panclxayets. They must, therefore, be either given communal electorates or relieved from unecpuil contests with advanced influential castes by reserving seats to them in plural consti-constituencies at least for 20 years. Similar provision is equally essential for the &quot;depressed classes.&apos; &quot;&quot; Indian Nationalists &quot; in Europe. According to German Wireless (August 17th) the European Central Committee of the Indian Nationalists publishes the following announcement: &quot; According to newspaper reports, the Reform proposals of the Secretary of State for India, Mr. Montagu, have been laid before the British Parliament. India is the heel, of Achilles of England. England states that she is fighting for the principle of nationalities, but hitherto she has always refused to carry this out in India, whereas the Indians themselves urge its being put into operation. The political situation in India requires it. All parties demand that England shall show her earnestness in India. All parties urge that England shall carry out these reforms which she preaches in Europe. All of them are united, stating that the present system cannot last. The Revolutionary Nationalists, who have been struggling for 15 years for the liberty of their Fatherland, have appreciably increased their activities during the war. Many thousands of them for their efforts in India and in the countries allied with England have had to suffer either death or imprisonment without rheir devotion to the cause thereby having been diminished. Even the so-called Moderates in India have now given up their reserved attitude, and with the Revolutionary Nationalists are struggling for the realisation of self-government for India. To-day all political bodies in India demand the keeping of the promise which England made before Europe. England is now in a difficult dilemma. On the one hand she is, by reason of the efforts of the Nationalists, and owing to the opinion which the world holds of her domination in India, anxious for the future and fearing that the Indian question may become an international question if she does not keep her promises ; and, on the other hand, she cannot really give India self-government without cutting off the branch on which she herself is seated. The former Secretary of State for India, Lord Crewe, has therefore stated that England has no guarantee that the Indians will remain loyal in a country where the English are in such a minority if they were given Home Rule, that, by these reforms, England bas no intention of giving a Home Rule to India which would so easily become the first step in the way of national libertj&apos;.&quot; The whole reform proposal is rather a war measure intended to quell excitement in India, and England thereby is only trying to throw sand in the eyes of India and the world. The Nationalist politicians of India are therefore not a bit pleased with the proposals, and they know how to assess them at their true value. The reform proposals mean neither the introduction of Home Rule in India nor the adoption of the principle of nationalities. With the announcement of this reform plan, the English are merely repeating a manoeuvre which has so often succeeded with them. * The word which they spoke came from an unwilling heart.&apos; &quot;
