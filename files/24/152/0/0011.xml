SECRET.APPRECIATION OE THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. SO.PART I. BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The suggested formation of a French-Canadian Brigade has mainly a political significance. It is to he hoped that the policy of providing French-Canadian reinforcements for the Quebec Battalions will meet the wishes of those interested.The increases in both the revenue and the war expenditure of the Dominion for the first five months of the current fiscal year should be noted. The figure as to the present net debt of the Dominion is interesting.The Washington statement as to the expenditure in Canada of money lent to Great Britain by the United States, and the connection of this with the adverse balance of Canadian trade with the United States, is no doubt intended to meet Parliamentary criticism in the latter country.Perhaps the most representative Labour Resolution connected with war measures is that, which has just been passed by the Trades and Labour Congress.Those citizens of the United States who are resident in Canada and who are liable to military service are now either registering in Canada or returning to the United States.Newfoundland.The latest figures relating to the effort of Newfoundland in the war, so far as man jjower is concerned, are highty ca-editable to a community of only some cpiarter of a million, the great majority of whom are engaged in the fishing industry and distributed in small hamlets round the seaboard.Australian Commonwealth.The outline of the Commonwealth Repatriation Scheme, which is given in this ,Report, is in accord with the underlying principle that the individual soldier shall not be prejudiced in civil life by reason of his service, and that he shall take his place in the State as a producer at the earliest moment possible. The arrangements with employers and Trade Unions for training men in new trades are of interest. (Of. similar arrangements under &quot;New Zealand.&quot;)Air. Watt has again emphasised the fact that territorial aggrandisement in the Pacific is not an Australian war aim, and that the Commonwealth would not be averse to the Pacific Islands being placed in the hands of a friendly Power if they are not included in the British Empire. It must not be concluded that this statement indicates any reluctance on the part of the Commonwealth to assume her share of the burden of Empire in the Pacific, but rather that Australia would agree to ,the administration of the Pacific Islands by a friendly Power if the terms of settlement precluded the extension of Australian control over those captured territories which are adjacent to the shores of the Commonwealth. [p.t.o.
The point mentioned in the Appreciation of last week as to the determination of the Government to proceed with their ship construction policy in spite of difficulties created by the Shipbuilding Award is now made clear by the Minister in charge of shipbuilding, whose comments on the situation of the industry are of interest.New Zealand.Some current information regarding the Repatriation arrangements, which are in operation in the Dominion are given in this Report. The generous financial assistance extended to returned soldiers to enable them to take up land, and the success achieved by soldier settlers up to the present, call for special attention.South Africa.The Resolution of the Associated Chambers of Commerce in favour of an oiler of the season&apos;s wool clip being made to the British Government does not necessarily indicate the view of the farmers, though it may have some influence upon the attitude which will be adopted by the latter when they meet in Conference at Pretoria next month.The Labour situation on the Rand continues to be disquieting.The Report of the Chief Magistrate of the Transkeian territories contains some interesting references to native disaffection and to the denial of the rights of citizenship to natives in the Transvaal, Orange Free State and Natal Provinces.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The Resolution passed by the Legislative Council recognising the necessity of a greater share being taken by India in the cost of the war is the most satisfactory feature of this week&apos;s Report.The justification for the Moderate abstention from the National Congress was fully shown by the proceedings of the Congress&apos;itself, but the explanation of the Secretary to the Moderate Conference is none the less useful for purposes of record.The satisfactory progress of recruiting should be noted, and more especially in its relationship to the Publicity Campaign.Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.The bad effect of the United States import restrictions on the cocoa industry in the Gold Coast and Nigeria may be readily understood.The German Wireless comments upon the South-West African Blue Book illustrate in the statement as to &quot; propagandist writings of our enemies &quot; how impossible it is to meet the evidence compiled from unimpeachable German sources with anything but deliberate mis-statements.II. d&apos;E.&apos; September 19th, 1918.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA. ..Suggested French-Canadian Brigade. With, reference to the suggested formation of a French-Canadian Brigade for. service oversea (vide Report No. 73), various difficulties have been recently-pointed out. in Ottawa, and it has been officially stated that if such a Brigade were formed in England there wotdd be no way in which it . could be utilised in France except by withdrawing an already existing Brigade, and this would involve strong-opposition. Further, it is stated that there is no need for a Thirteenth Brigade, Canada being definitely committed to the policy of maintaining one Army Corps, as a result of which it is necessary that her man-power should be utilised scientifically with that end in view. A policy has, however, already been inaugurated, by means of which a definite proportion of all reinforcements for the four Quebec Battalions will be composed exclusively of French-Canadians. These units will therefore become French-Canadian&apos; in character, and this is considered the only way in which the wishes of those who desire to see French-Canadian units in the field can be met.Dominion Revenue, War Expenditure and Debt. There has been an increase of over twelve and a half million dollars in the revenue of the Dominion for the first five months of the current fiscal year, ended August 31st. .. This increase is encouraging&apos; on account of the fact that the Customs collections in the same period fell off approximately by seven million dollars.The war expenditure of the Domiuion in the five months above mentioned amounted to 63,580,000 dollars, as compared with 51,427,000 dollars during the months April to August 1917.The net debt of the Dominion now stands at 1,196,239,346 dollars.United States and. Dominion : Finance and Trade. According to a statement issued at Washington, about $400,000,000 of United States funds lent to Great Britain have been spent in Canada for wheat and munitions, and this fact has contributed materially to improving the situation which was so adverse to Canadian business interests. This became known in connection with the Treasury reports, which state that exports from the United States to Canada in the past vear were 8778,000,000, while the imports from Canada were $443,000,000, leaving about 8335,000,000 balance against the Dominion,, in addition to interest on maturities on &apos; Canadian obligations in the United States.Labour Congress and War Measures. The Thirty-Fourth Annual Convention of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada opened in Quebec this week, when 418 delegates from all parts of the Dominion attended. According to a Press cable, a Resolution asking for the repeal of the Military Service Act was defeated by 304 votes to 114. The Congress then passed a Resolution (with one dissentient) conveying greetings to Trade Unionists in the trenches, and promising the whole-hearted support of Labour in war measures. The Report of the Executive Council stated that 32,000 Trade Unionists have now enlisted.&quot;United States Citizens and Military Service.-Instructions to all male United States&apos; citizens living in Canada who are within, the American draft ages 18 to 45 inclusive to submit themselves for registration, have been issued by the American Consul-Generab They are required to register at once. American citizens in Canada who are subject to the new draft law have two courses open to them. They may leave Canada any time&quot; up &quot;to October 11th and return to the States for the purpose of registering &quot;there, or they may apply for registration at the American Consulate in the Dominion.   All who fail to register within the period allowed will become
liable to compulsory military service in the Canadian Forces by the terms of the American-Canadian Military Service Convention.Government and Railways.  - A Government cheque has been issued for -f 8,500,000, payable to the order of Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann and the Canadian Bank of Commerce, in connection with the purchase of the Canadian Northern Railway.A temporary Board of Directors, working in conjunction with the Government, it is officially announced will administer the Canadian Northern Railway probably for some time.Negotiations for the purchase by the Government of the Grand Trunk are being continued, and until some conclusion is reached it is unlikely that a permanent board will be appointed.Should the Government succeed in acquiring the Grand Trunk, it is proposed to appoint one Board of Control under corporate management for the whole system of Government railways from coast to coast.NEWFOUNDLAND.Effort in the War] The figures relating to the provision of men for the war by Newfoundland up to August 31st, 1918, are as follows : Number of men recruited for the Royal Newfoundland Regiment (of whom 4,855 have left the Dominion on active Service)             -            -            -            - 5,583Number of men recruited for the Newfoundland ForestryCorps    -          -          --                    -          -         - 185Number of men recruited for the Royal Naval Reserve(estimated)     -         -  -             -             -             - 2,000Nmuber of men who joined the Canadian Forces, &amp;c.(estimated)        -          -          ---     .-          -       . - 2,000Total      - - -    10,068The casualties incurred in the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in all theatres of war amount to :  Killed or died of wounds -----        751Died from other causes - - - -74Wounded and missing -        ^ - - - -      2,263Prisoners - - - - -        151Total - - 3.239AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH. The Repatriation Scheme.1Pmnciple of Scheme. The repatriation scheme is now in full operation in Australia, and 39,000 men have already been dealt.with as regards employment, financial assistance, &amp;c. The fundamental principle of the scheme is that from the point of view of the individual neither those who enlisted for active service abroad nor their dependants shall suffer economic or any kind of civil prejudice by reason of their military service ; and from the point of view of the community, it is essential that every individual shall resume his place in the community as a productive and useful member with the maximum efficiency at the earliest possible time.Any assistance given under the scheme is not in substitution for, but in addition to, pensions paid according to incapacity, or in the case of dependants, according to the degree of dependence, under the provisions of the War Pensions Act.1 See also under &quot; New Zealand.&quot;
Provision of Land and Agricultural Training-A man with; the inclination, aptitude, and physical capacity for engaging in farming pursuits will be assisted financially on easy terms up to 2501. to enable him to take up land and to acquire the stock and equipment necessary for making a success of the undertaking. Agricultural training will be given in the various colleges throughout the country and on approved farms, and the soldier will be maintained by the Government during the course of training. On completion of instruction, the Repatriation Department, working in conjunction with the State Governments, will see that the men are given the opportunity to take up blocks and work their own farms.-Industrial and Technical Training. Men unable through disability resultant upon service to pursue their usual avocations will be trained in other occupations to which their disability is no bar. During the period of training they are&apos; guaranteed incomes ranging from 42s. to 66s. weekly ; or the minimum wage of the industry in which they are undergoing training if such training is being effected in industrial establishments.The Government have made arrangements with employers and with the Trades Unions for training men in trades in which they are not skilled. The arrangement is that the returned soldier who may take up a new trade shall receive from the beginning the full ruling rate of wages. At first he would be rated at, say, 40 per cent, of full efficiency. In that case the employer would pay 40 per cent, of the full wages and the Government would pay the other 60 per cent. As the man&apos;s efficiency increased, the share of bis wages to be paid by the employer would increase until, when he reached the ordinary standard of trade efficiency, the employer would be paying the 100 per cent, of the full ruling rate of wages.Special provision has been made to provide technical training for returned soldiers. It is recognised that many, particularly the younger men, would wish to qualify themselves for some technical occupation. Steps have been taken to make it possible for them to do so. In Victoria, for instance, arrangements have been made for the training of 2,000 returned soldiers at technical schools. Similar action has been taken in other States, and the men who wish to get technical training have many opportunities to do so.Widows and Children.  Provision is made under the scheme for the widows and children of soldiers and sailors. Widows with children are entitled to gifts of 25?.. for the purchase of furniture to enable them to re-establish their homes ; and to augment their means of livelihood amounts up to 250Z. will be advanced to them to assist in the purchasing of businesses, plant, stock and live stock, and their pensions will be supplemented and fees paid where widows with or without children decide to undergo training in&apos; any calling. They may also be granted rental allowances, or such other assistance as the Minister thinks proper.Public Service. The law regulating admission to the Commonwealth Public Service has been amended so as to give special facilities to ex-service men to enter the public service aud to be appointed to higher classes, if they are suitably qualified, than is possible in normal circumstances.Mr. Watt on Repatriation and the Future of the Pacific. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) in visiting Bendigo last week to inaugurate an appeal for funds, for repatriation purposes said: &quot; Repatriation must be solemnly undertaken with all the skill, resolution, and resource at the command of the people of the Commonwealth. The citizens as well as the Government should recognise that they have a new duty of repatriation.&quot;Referring to the Pacific, Mr. Watt said that &quot;Australia is not fighting for extra territory, but wants her future to be made safe. The, war has taught Australia that the Pacific Islands would be a great menace if they were returned to Germany. They should be in our hands or in those of a friendly power.&quot;Arrived of French Mission. An enthusiastic welcome was given to the French Mission on its arrival at Sydney on September 11th. An extensive itinerary has been prepared, which covers visits to pastoral; industrial and commercial centres. &amp;
Shipbuilding: Prospects and Difficulties.- The Minister in charge of Shipbuilding (Mr. Poynton) stated last week that, having visited every shipbuilding yard in..the Comtnonwealth, he is optimistic regarding the output for the immediate future. The first steel ship will be launched in November at Williams town, and another in December. The delay at Walsh Island is due to the shortage of imported steel plates, but the Broken Hill Company would commence rolling steel plates next month. He did not anticipate serious trouble from the dilution of labour or piece-work when the yards were in full swing.Commenting on Mr. Justice Higgins&apos; award in the shipbuilding case, Mr. Poynton said it was impossible to work under it. The only effect would be to annul all efforts made throughout many months to get shipbuilding organisation into line. Mr. Justice Higgins apparently overlooked the fact that, included in the 31 unions accepting the agreement, Avas the Australian Society of Engineers. To give effect to the award would mean that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, which did all it could to break the agreement, would be allowed to work without signing it. Chaos would then result. A further objection was the creation of two additional Boards to deal with the^rlilution of labour. The chief virtue of the Government tribunal was a uniform decision. One could not conceive of three Boards dealing with the same subject and reaching uniformity.In conclusion Mr. Poynton said he regretted Mr. Justice- Higgins&apos; remark that it looked to him as if the attitude of trie Commonwealth Government was an obstinate effort to force someoue&apos;s will, whether a useful purpose was served or not. As Minister in charge of Shipbuilding, he never attempted to force piecework conditions on the managers of the shipbuilding yards,.NEW ZEALAND. Repatriation Arrangements.&apos;Provision of Land and Financial Assistance. Arrangements are in operation in the Dominion by means of which, returned soldiers who desire to take up farming may be provided with land. For this purpose lots of privately owned land have been purchased by the Government, some of which have been surveyed for soldier settlement purposes. Up to the end of August of this year over 700 soldier settlers had been provided with laud, and most of these settlers are doing well. Land Boards in the different districts of the. Dominion select, the settlers according to the varieties of land available and to the requirements of the men. The latter obtain land at cost price, and those desiring it can get financial assistance up to 500L In special cases 7-50/C may be advanced on the recommendation of the Land Board. Five per cent, interest is charged, and the conditions are made as easy as possible. According as an intending settler requires laud for sheep-farming, dairy or poultry-farming, or fruit-growing, the Land Boards endeavour to suit him. On the other-hand, if a returned soldier prefers to settle in one of the towns, and desires to become the owner of his own house, he can take advantage of the Workers&apos; Homes Act, and have a cottage built for him ; or if a suitable house can be purchased at its proper value, arrangements for financing the purchase can be made.Sale is not permitted for a number of years in connection with the present scheme,, except in the case of death, or some serious family or financial trouble.Technical and IndunLrial&apos; Training. In order that partially incapacitated men may have an opportunity of adding to their incomes and becoming as independent as possible, arrangements have been made by which they can attend classes at technical schools for the purpose of learning book-keeping, typewriting, shorthand, or obtaining a knowledge of technical machinery, or handicrafts which do not require a term of apprenticeship in order to produce proficiency. In these cases the Government allows the learner 11. per week, in addition to his pension, while he is at the school, and many men have already taken advantage of the system.Other cases for which provision is made are those of partially incapacitated men who are not able to work at the trades at which they were formerly employed, and who find it necessary to learn another trade, or those who were unskilled labourers before6465-3 a- See also under &quot; Australian Commonwealth.&quot;B
enlistment, and whoso incapacity makes it necessary for them to learn a trade suitable to their injuries. In the latter cases arrangements are made with the proprietors of industrial establishments in &quot;the trade which the incapacitated man desires to learn. After consultation with the Trades Onion authorities, the amount which the beginner is able to earn is fixed, and the difference between this rate and the minimum wage paid in the industry for adult labour is contributed by the State, until the learner becomes sufficiently proficient in the calling to be worth the minimum wage&quot;without any subsidy. Both while he is learning and afterwards the soldier&apos;s pension is not interfered with.Information Department. The Discharged Soldiers&apos; Information Department has. been set up to supply soldiers with information likely to be of value and to secure them suitable employment. On April 2nd: last the total number of men. on the register amounted to 17,651,Allowances to Soldiers Dependants.   During the session of Parliament held in New Zealand in April last, the Government decided that the allowances to children of soldiers of the Expeditionary Force should be increased from 7s. to 10s. Gd. per week, as from 1st May last.This increase, together with the basis of 3s. a clay allotment to a soldier&apos;s wife by the soldier himself, provides ;  Per week.	s.	d.For wife and one child	-   52	6,,       ,,     two children	-   63	0,,       ,,.    three children	-   73	6,,   -  ,,     four children	-   81	0,,       ,,     five children   -            . -	-   94	6It has also been decided to increase the amount&quot; of income which the widowed mother may receive, without affecting her allowance, from 10s. a week to 15s. a week. This will permit those in receipt of an old age pension, including the war bonus, to benefit by the widowed motheFs allowance, and will permit of others not in receipt of an old age pension, but of income otherwise derived up to 15s. a week, also benefiting by the widowed motheFs allowance. The Cabinet, has also decided that the limitation of capital which debarred the receipt of an allowance should be increased to 500Z.*The Dominion Cabinet further decided with respect to dependent relatives other than wife, child, or widowed mother, who have been, dependent- on the soldier for 12 months prior to his enlistment, that an allowance will be paid equivalent to the amount paid by the soldier, with a maximum limitation of 10s. Qd. per week.Prime Minister and Work of Imperial War Cabinet. The Prime Minister of the Dominion (Mr. W. F. Massey) when speaking in Montreal on September 15th, on his way through Canada, declared that the Imperial War Cabinet had done a vast amount of useful work from the Empire point of view and had brought the Mother Country and all the Dominions together as never before. &quot; Prior to the holding of the first Imperial War Cabinet in 1917,&quot; Mr. Massey is reported to have said, &quot; British citizens outside the United Kingdom had no say in anything connected with Imperial politics. That was altered, to some extent by the first War Cabinet, which worked well. It became more representative this year, because Australia, which was not there on the first occasion, was represented.&quot; .SOUTH AFRICA.Wool Cliv-The Congress of Associated Chambers of Commerce of South Africa i nnmrW to a Rente&quot; message of September 12th, unanimously passed a reso-iXnTtte^ Sll0&quot;ld re0peU negotiations with the-i v with the object of getting the latter, to repeat last year, offer for such &quot;portion of this seasons wool clip as may be registered at a given date.
Labour Situation on the Band. The iroumoulclers, who are at present on strike, have by a itnanimous vote seceded from the Industrial Federation. There is now no hope (a Reuter message states) of negotiations, with a view to a settlement of the dispute, being conducted by the Federation on behalf of the ironmoulders. A conference between the Ironmoulders Society and delegates of the Industrial Federation&quot; has been held and has revealed some divergence of opinion. The Secretary of the Federation stated that in view of the conclusion reached by the Federation that there Avas a real danger of the low grade mines closing down, the minority of organised trades should consider the majority who&apos; would, be adversely affected. It was felt, he said, that the ironmonlclers&apos; strike must eventually affect everyone on the reef. The President of the Federation has suggested negotiation with&apos;a view to the settlement of the dispute.The Central District Branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers has decided not to strike in support of the&apos; ironmoulders.The Mine Workers Union has decided, by a majority of four to one, in favour of accepting the terms of the Chamber of Mines which include a war bonus. The Union also decided against a strike.Native Labour and Native Rights. The report of the Chief Magistrate of the Transkeian territories (Mr. Moffat) on native strikes and disaffection has been published in the Gazette. It strongly condemns the influence of the journal of the International Socialist League, remarking that if -steps are not taken &quot;to counteract the League&apos;s propaganda a serious catastrophe will be inevitable.&quot; The report considers that the native strikes at Johannesburg on June 6th and Sth were the inevitable consequence of the Municipality&apos;s conceding the demands of the European employees. Mr. l\foffat suggests the establishment of a Disputes Board to deal with native labour troubles, and advises the withdrawal of the colour bar provisions from the mining regulations.Dealing with the lack of confidence in the Government among natives, particularly educated natives, Mr. Moffat says it is felt that the Government have adopted a repressive policy and that the tendency of legislation, is to emphasise and perpetuate the position of the natives as a subject race. So long as the natives- are denied the rights of citizens and parliamentary votes, says the Report, there cannot be any real contentment in the countiy, but owing to the unlikelihood of these being granted in the Transvaal, Orange Free State or Natal Provinces in the near future, it is necessary to provide means for the natives resident there to voice their views and wishes.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Legislative Council and a Larger Financial Share in the War. A debate took place in the Legislative Council on September 9th and 10th on the subject of a further contribution b\&apos;India towards the cost of the war. The Finance Member proposed that additional Army charges should be met by India estimated to amount approximate^ to-12,700,000?. for 1918-19, .14,700,000?.. for 1919-20, and 7,700,000 for 1920-21 (on the assumption that this was the year of demobilisation),, with a. further 10,000,000?. on account of increased pension charges, the central idea being a contribution by India towards the cost from 1st April 1918 of 200,000 of the additional troops raised in that country for service in the war. The Finance Member explained that the contribution programme in respect of this year would be financed without resort to fresh taxation, and that for next year additional taxation proposals would be put forward as part of the Budget programme. Excess profits duty would be placed in the forefront of the proposals, which would be prepared so as to avoid placing an undue burden on the poorer classes.   He also said  that the present6465-3a &apos; C
programme would be liable to reconsideration in tbe event of trouble on tbe frontier, a change for the worse in the agricultural situation, or a serious currency breakdown.The following Resolution Avas unwed -. -&quot; That this Council recognises that the prolongation of the Avar justifies lnclia&apos;s taking a larger share than she does at present in respect of the cost of military forces raised or to be raised in this country&quot; ; and it was left to the vote of the non-official Members of Council. Several patriotic speeches were made, and the Resolution was passed by a majority of 18 -votes to 5, subject to the following amendment : &quot; And recommends that such larger share be to the extent and under the knowledge and safeguards indicated in the speech of the Hon. Finance Member in moving the Resolution &quot; ; which was moved by Mr. Sastri Avith the object of emphasising the assurance that taxation Avould be so assessed as not to press on the poorer classes, and would as explained above be subject to reconsideration in the light of the general financial position.Moderates and the National Congress. The Moderate Anew of the recent National Congress is given in a letter to the Press by Air. Semarth, Secretary of the Moderate Conference, AArho states that thinking people all over the country will have seen by this time that the Moderates as a body were perfectly justified in abstaining from the special session of the Congress, thereby preventing the Extremists from claiming that the Resolution of the Congress on the Reform Scheme represented the unanimous verdict of educated India on the subject. The Moderate leaders did not doubt that the Resolution of the Congress would be,, as has turned out, substantially Extremist, and that their presence at the Congress Avould have resulted in stultifying them, and leading to a compromise which nobody would! haA^e taken seriously.Progress of Recruiting.--It is officially stated that the total number of men enlisted for the combatant forces throughout India during the month of July last -amounted to 42,614. This shows an increase of 10,U00 over the June figures. Reports from Simla cabled to the Press at the beginning of the present month indicated a continuance of recruiting on a highly satisfactory scale. The statement is made that the number of combatants now enrolled every fortnight is as great as the annual addition to the Indian Army before the war. There has been a great reAuval of recruiting in the United Provinces.Publicity Campaign. Reports indicate that the Avar journals published in the vernacular have reached a large circulation, and the educated classes are being-provided with pamphlets, neAvspaper articles, and University and school lectures. Inhabitants of the Adllages are being reached by popular lectures, recitations, cine-matographs, and illustrated papers, and it is stated in the Press that the publicity -efforts are having a beneficial effect upon recruiting.COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.GOLD COAST AND NIGERIA.United States and Cocoa Imports. The British Charge dAffaires at Washington has been informed by the Foreign Office that from the standpoint of Colonial interests and for political reasons the Colonial Office state that the most serious of all import restrictions imposed by the United States is that on cocoa from the Gold Coast and Nigeria.GERMANY IN SOUTH-WEST A FRIG A.German View of British Blue Book. German Wireless of September 16th states :-&apos;: The English Blue Book regarding the atrocities against natives of German South-West Africa has been correctly estimated, even before its publication, in the
following manner by the Basler National Zeitung : &apos; The- peculiarity will be noticed that such allegations of atrocities are always put forward when England is feeling the need for an extension of her power. It is merely an attempt at- incitation on the part of England in order to create a feeling in favour of the planned campaign for the robbery of Germany&apos;s colonies.&apos; In spite of the well simulated indignation of the English newspapers regarding the alleged atrocities, Germany may look forward with calmness to the further investigation of the question. Our native policy before the war has not been conducted under conditions of secrecy. Numerous foreigners of the States which are to-day neutral, who formerly lived in the regions under our protection, are acquainted with our methods, and are more competent to give a correct picture of the conditions than the propagandist writings of our enemies. Even if England, by means of money and good words, has succeeded in inducing natives to make the desired statements regarding alleged atrocities, it is astonishing that she should dare to attack Germany regarding&apos; a matter in which she herself has been guilty of misdeeds with which volumes could be filled. How can those who on the battlefields of France have used as cannon fodder thousands of natives, who have been raised by compulsion and forced into a war which is incomprehensible to them, pose as judges on the matter of the treatment of natives ? &quot; -
