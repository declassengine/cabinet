PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.. Universal Military Training and other matters of Policy. The Dominion Minister of Militia (Major-General Mewburu), in speaking last week before the Great War Veterans&apos; Association, made an important reference to the future policy of Canada in relation to military training. He stated that he had no hesitation in saying that the day would come when they would have universal training in Canada. He did not mean compulsory military service,, but be meant that the youth of Canada could and should give up one, two or three weeks for one or two years to go into camps of -instruction and get some discipline in training.In a previous speech delivered shortly after his return to the Dominion, General Mew burn said he felt that his recent visit to the front and to England would assist closer co-operation between Canada, England, and France, with a definite object always in view, i.e., one Canadian Army, with tire closest co-ordination and most active co-operation all along the line. In connection with the above, it is of interest to note that General Mewbnrn observed last week : &quot; We believe that before long we shall have a Tank Brigade within the Canadian Corps. The question is now under consideration.&apos;&apos;Dominion Representation at Vladivostock. The British representative at Vlaclivostock has informed the Foreign Office that he understands that Canadians in Vladivostock are urging upon the Dominion Government the desirability of appointing a civilian representative there in view of the special interests of the Dominion -and the presence of Dominion troops. Mr. Alston suggests that as close commercial relations between Canada and Siberia are probable, such a representative might be usefully attached to the staff of the Economic Commissioner.Sir W. Laurier and a, League of Nations.-Addressing a meeting in Montreal, the Leader of the Opposition (Sir W. Laurier) endorsed the idea of a League of Nations. He stated, however, that such a League could never be a success so long as one great nation was unwilling to abide by its pledged word and was left outside.. Such a nation, Sir Wilfrid declared, was Germany, in which country he saw little change of heart since the war started. Declaring himself to be a pacifist of old, he said that the Allied nations could not enter into peace parleys with the Central Powers on the basis of recent speeches made in Germany and Austria.Government and Enemy Propaganda. The Government are taking energetic measures to deal with publications and other literature printed in the language of nations with whom great Britain and the Allies are at war. Under authority of the War Measures Act, drastic regulations have been issued to deal with enemy language pub-publicity, and ample power has been provided for their enforcement. Any person who brings into Canada, or prints, publishes, delivers, or has possession of such matter after October 1st will be liable to a fine not exceeding -$5,000, or five years&apos; imprisonment. &quot; Publication &quot; is interpreted to mean any known form of publicity from books to posters, and applies to any country at war with the Aides, or peoples or countries under control &quot;of enemy nations. The regulations do not apply to publications of &quot;a merely literary, scientific, religious or artistic character not containing objectionable matter.&quot; The Postmaster-General is authorised to open mails, and powers of seizure and examination are given to Customs officials.I.W.W. and Unlaioful Associations. An Orcler-in-Council under the War Measures Act has been signed by the Governor-General which is specially intended to suppress the activities of the Industrial Workers of the World and similar organisa-tions which use both open and underhand means in an attempt to curtail Canada&apos;s
war effort and create unrest throughout the Dominion. The associations named as unlawful are the Industrial Workers of the World, and certain Russian, Ukrainian,-and Bolshevist Social, Democratic and Revolutionary bodies. The Order also embraces i any body which proposes to bring about any governmental, political, social, industrial or economic change in Canada by the use of force, injury or threats, and provides punishment for persons teaching this doctrine.Uniform&apos; Distribution of Coal. Regulations providing for a more uniform distribution of coal needed for industrial uses in Canada have been approved by the Governor-in-Council at the instance of the Dominion Fuel Controller. This action has become necessary through arrangements recentlj7 completed for shipment of coal from the United States to Canada on a system of regular monthly allotments. The regulations provide that all mine operators in Canada and importers shall rotate their deliveries among customers in proportion to requirements. Provision is made whereby mine operators and importers may require a certified statement from customers regarding tonnage on hand. A. preference list of consumers is outlined, and includes railroads, military and Government buildings, public utilities, retail dealers, and manufacturing plants chiefly engaged on war contracts. These will receive preference of supply in the order named.Record Deposits in Savings Banks. The returns issued by the Finance Depart-ment show that the savings deposits in the Canadian Banks totalled at the end of August 81,041,711,863, representing an increase of more than -$22,000,000 over the previous month, and an increase of over 862,000,000 as compared with August 1917. The record established in savings deposits is regarded as especially satisfactory in view of the coming War Loan, preparations for which are now being undertaken.Output of Silver. The output of silver from Ontario, chiefly during the first half of the current year, averages 81,377,937 per month. With the price of silver now at over one dollar to the ounce, compared with 88 cents at the beginning of the war, the last half of 1918 promises to show a higher record than the first half.. There is reasonable assurance, therefore, that the total output for 191S will have a value of over 816,000,000.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Commonwealth Budget. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) delivered the Budget Speech in the House of Representatives on September 25th. He said the revenue totalled 38,880,395Z., and the expenditure was 34,975,304Z., instead of the estimated accounts which exactly balanced. The year closed with a surplus of 3,905,091Z.   Excluding the surplus brought forward, the actual surplus was 1,827,664Z.The estimated revenue for the current year, including last year&apos;s surplus, was 39,219,593Z., and the estimated expenditure, 45,344,959Z. To make up the difference it was proposed to raise additional revenue as follows : Customs and Excise, 19S,500Z., from new duties on stimulants and tobacco ; income tax, an increase of 30 per cent., yielding 2,300,000Z. ; land tax, an increase of 20 per cent., yielding 380,000Z. ; enter-tainments tax of Id. on 3cZ. and 6cZ. tickets, previously untaxed, yielding 275,000Z. ; a postage war tax of a \d. on letters, letter-cards, postcards, and newspaper packets, yielding 516,000Z. Adding 800,000Z. transferred to London funds, the estimated surplus reaches 30,996Z.War Expenditure. In the course of his Budget statement the Acting Prime Minister stated that the war expenditure from loans to June 30th, 1918, was 159,895,038Z. ; from revenue, 24,702,159Z. The total war loans raised in Australia were 148,922,36SZ., the sum loaned by the British Government was 47,500,000Z. There was due to the British Government for maintenance of troops, 38,345,000Z. ; advanced from notes fund, 371,118Z. The total amount provided for war loan purposes was 235,138,486Z. After making provision for payment to the British Government and war expenses, there remained war loan balances of 23,7.10,662Z. and 12,943,901Z., representing instalments not paid. The estimated war expendi-ture for 1918-19 was 100,044,411Z., towards which 2l,129,602Z. were provided from revenue and 78,914,809Z. from loan. Proceeding, Mr. Watt said it was a matter for regret that the Commonwealth had relied on the British Governments help  in financing Australia&apos;s share of the Avar.   The prosperity of Australia Avas
remarkable. At least the Commonwealth should arrange, he said, for the future -current expenses of the Atistralian armies to be met by Australian money. That was the basis on which these estimates were framed. The total war expenditure estimated to June 1919 amounted to 284,641,608Z. .-War Loan : compulsory subscriptions : the task ahead.- Referring to War Loan arrangements in his Budget statement, Mr. Watt said the Government had decided to introduce legislation to compel all persons to subscribe to Avar loans in proportion to their means. To the extent subscriptions might fall short of the amount required, resort must be made to compulsion. During the next ten years, he said, about 390,000,0001.. of Australian Loans have to be redeemed, representing 200,000,000/. State Loans and the balance War Loans. Practically the whole must be provided by renewed flotations. Additional sums were required for the Avar, repatriation and public works. A herculean task was ahead of the Commonwealth, therefore he proposed to the States to give the Commonwealth full control of borrowing for the three years ending December 1921.Repatriation Achievements.-An outline of actual work accomplished in tbe direction of repatriation was given by the Acting Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on September 25th. (Vide also Report No. 86.) Mr. Watt stated that from the proclamation of the Repatriation Act in April until July 31st, 16,469 applications aaTere received, and 12,001 men had been placed in &apos; employment. The number out Avas 2,719, but the.Department had 3,278 positions offering. Theapplica-tions for general assistance number 30,972, of which 23,649 had been approved. From August 1917 to June last, 3,355 applications for land settlement had been confirmed, and 1,618 blocks allotted, excluding Queensland which was outside the Commonwealth agreement. Hostels for permanently or totally incapacitated men have been provided in Sydney and Melbourne, and provision for other States will follow. Provision has been made for repatriation generally for the current year of 100,OOOZ. ; for advances to States for land settlement, 1,500,000Z. ; for acR-auces to States for forestry, operations to absorb returned men, 500,000Z. ; national workshops, community settlements, hostels and vocational training, 230,000Z. ; and provision for Avar pensions, 5,000,000Z.The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Milieu), addressing the members of the Interstate Country Press Association in Melbourne last week, said that no soldier could honestly say he was friendless if he would! only get into touch withjthe Repatria-tion Department. Until he was able to earn the minimum wage, he was provided with sustenance; 600 men had been trained, and 1,700 were undergoing training. The Department nevier had five minutes&apos; delay in finding positions for men who had been trained. Technical classes and national Avorkshops were being established for men whose earning capacity AAras not 100 per cent.Shipbuilding Programme. The shipbuilding programme announced by the Acting Prime Minister in Parliament proAndes for the construction in Australia of 24 steel and 24 wooden vessels costing 5,376,000Z. Five steel ships are now under construction.Air Service-The Acting Prime Minister has informed Parliament that it has been decided to establish a new course at the Central Hying School for producing pilots completely trained. Proposals have been worked out, he said, for the creation of an air service for Australia on a more extensiAwe scale than Avas contemplated before the Avar, and a large expenditure is likely within the Commonwealth.&apos; Furlough for Anzacs: question of Discharge. The Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr. Wise), replying to a question in the House of Representatives on September 25th, said approval of the Imperial Authorities for-the return of&quot; Anzacs &quot; to Australia was-obtained only after the Government, through Mr. Hughes and Sir Joseph Cook, had persistently urged the claims of the men to furlough. Real difficulties faced the War Office. The Commonwealth Government, while yielding to none in their recognition of the services the men had rendered, regretted they could not encourage a proposal for the AAdiolesale discharge of the men from the Army. Favourable consideration of individual applications for discharge were necessarily confined to cases possessing unusual features of financial or domestic hardship.
Voluntary &apos; Ballot:  a   significant   Resolution. The   Minister for Recruiting (Mr. Orchard) has announced that the taking of the Voluntary Enlistment Ballot -&quot; will synchronise with the arrival home of the original Anzacs.&quot;A member of the Official Labour Party (Senator Grant) moved in the Senate on September 28th that all Australian Imperial Force men who had been away for three years should be granted six months&apos; furlough with facilities to visit Australia. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) pointed out that if conscription had been adopted, Australia would have been able to give her sons a rest. He moved as an amendment to the motion that &quot; the Senate, however, recognises that at this critical stage of the war it is essential in order that effect may be given to this motion and to maintain the fighting forces that sufficient reinforcements should be enlisted, and that &quot;members therefore pledge themselves to do all in their power, individually and collectively, to make a success of the forthcoming appeal through the voluntary ballot.&quot; The motion as amended was carried unanimously. This result is regarded as significant in view of the fact that the Labour League of New South Wales advised all New South Wales Labour members to refrain from taking part in voluntary recruiting until the Perth Conference ballot had been decided. This ballot, upon the cpiestion of making. Labour participation in recruiting dependent upon an Allied policy of peace without annexations oiyndemnities (vide Report No. 85), has been approved by the Executive of the Official Labour Party, who have announced that they will proceed with it in spite of recommendations to the contrary.Opposition Criticism of Press delegation.- In the Commonwealth House of Representatives, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) said that he was dissatisfied with the Empire Press delegation from Australia, of which, he declared, practically the whole represented the conscriptionist forces. Only two anti-conscription repre-sentatives had been invited, of whom one had been unable to go.Irish Republican Brotherhood. Mr. Justice Harvey&apos;s report on the internment of seven Irishmen under the War Precautions Act has been tabled in the House of Representatives. Mr. Justice Harvej^ said there appears to be no evidence that any interned men had any connection with enemy persons resident in the Commonwealth. Such of the internees as were members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood had by virtue of that membership hostile associations through German agencies in America. They had collected moneys in Australia for the purpose of assisting armed rebellion in Ireland against the British Government on the first available opportunity-. This money was expended in the purchase of warlike material from Germany with which country the leaders of the movement were in communication. In Australia thej- made use of the Irish National Association to further their aims, but it is not shown that the rank and file of the Association had any knowledge of their connection with Germany. The evidence tendered before him wras almost entirely documentary. The internees themselves put forward no evidence to explain away any suspicious circumstances. The Cabinet having considered the report, decided that the detentions should contiuue.Use of Red Flag. A war precautions regulation has been issued prohibiting the Exhibition or use of a red flag on any building, land, vessel, or in any public place, or in connection with any procession or demonstration, without the permission of the Minister of Defence. The regulation does not apply to the use of a red flag by public departments.Queensland Legislative Council. In the Queensland Legislative Assembly the motion of the Premier (Mr. Ryan) in favour of abolishing the Upper House was carried by 35 votes to IS.SOUTH AFRICA.Air Training School. The Minister of Lands (Colonel Mentz) has announced that arrangements have been practically completed with the Imperial authorities for&quot; the establishment of an air training school in South Africa.   (Vide Report No. S2.)Transvaal Gold Output: serious Position. At a meeting of the Chamber of Mines on September 23rd, the President (Mr. Wallers) referred to the serious position regarding the Transvaal gold output.   He pointed out that the decrease in the first eight6633-la . B
months of 1918 amounted to 1,315,694-L, while in the same period the working-costs increased by 468,698Z. Of 49 contributing companies six were making an actual loss, while 15 showed a small profit, but standing charges turned the profit into a loss. Under existing conditions the end was growing very hear. It would be a pity, he said, if the actual closing down of some mines was required to bring home the real position.Sir George Albu, at a meeting of the General Mining and Finance Corporation, urged that Imperial action should be taken before it was too late.Industrial Situation. Information cabled to the Press indicates an improvement in the industrial situation on the Pand (vide Report No. 86). A sliding scale of wages, corresponding to the increased cost of living, appears likely to promise a satisfactory solution of the working conditions on the mines. There is, however, still cause for anxiety through the strike of the iron moulders, but the latest news shows that&apos;the re-opening of negotiations is imminent, and a resulting settlement is anticipated.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Moderate Conference. In connection with the Moderate Conference which is to take place during the present month, Mr. Banerjee issued a circular recently to the-Bengal Moderates, in which he pointed out the reality of the differences between the Extremists and Moderates as evidenced by discussions at the Bombay National Congress.   In the course of this circular Mr. Banerjee states :  &quot; From the proceedings of the special session of the Congress just held you will find that the points of difference between the views of the Moderate Party and the Extremists are deep and fundamental.&quot; (1) We welcome the reform proposals as a distinct step in the progressive realisation of responsible government, while they think the proposals diappointing-and unsatisfactory.&quot; (2) We accept the pronouncement of August 20th in its entirety, while they do not.&quot; (3) The modifications we ask for lie within the four corners of the pronouncement of August 20th, but the suggestions they make go beyond that pronouncement and are inconsistent with its basic idea.&quot;Speeches of Nationalist Leader. An order has been served on the Nationalist leader (Mr. Tilak) directing him, under rules made under the Defence of India Act, -to abstain from making any public speech without the previous permission in writing of the District Magistrate of any district in which he maj-propose to speak. The prohibition does not apply to any speech &quot; confined to the subject of constitutional reforms made at a special session of the Indian National Congress summoned for the purpose of discussing that subject.&quot; The ground for the probibitio?i is that Mr. Tilak recently made a speech at Poona calculated to discourage recruiting for die Indian Army, at a time when a great increase is necessary for the prosecution of the wrar and the defence of India.Sedition Committee Report : Debate in Legislative Council. An interesting-discussion has taken&apos; place in the Imperial Legislative Council upon a resolution, moved by Mr. Ivhaparde, proposing that the recommendations of the Sedition Com-mittee be kept in abeyance and a searching inquiry made into the working of the-Criminal Investigation Department.   This was rejected by 46 votes to 2.In the course of the debate, Sir William Vincent and Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer paid high tributes to the work of the police in unearthing conspiracies, Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer declaring that the information supplied and the action by the Department had prevented a rising in the Punjab in 1915.
Sir Verney Lovett, as a member of tbe Sedition Committee, said the Committee, in framing their recommendations, had in mind the Indian victims&apos; mothers (whose sons had been seduced by the conspirators) the shopkeepers who had been robbed, and the schoolmasters and police who had been cruelly murdered for doing their duty. A considerable number of non-official Indians joined in the eulogy of the police and urged that,the time for criticisms of the Sedition Committee Report would be when recommendations were presented in a legislative form. Several complained that they were being shadowed by the police, whereupon Sir &apos; William A^incent promised immediate action to remedy the grievance.Mr. Khaparde said the Bombay Government had refused his friend, Mr. Tilak, papers for use in rebutting Sir Valentine Chirobs charges, on the ground that they were privileged. Mr. Khaparde maintained that these papers had been before the Committee.BRITISH COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RHODESIA.Rewards for Native Carriers. During the course of 1917 the demands for carriers from Northern Rhodesia for the military operations in East Africa produced a severe pressure upon the native -population. The work was unpopular and dangerous to life and health, and the mortality among the carriers was high. In order to induce the recruisite number of natives to come forward, the Administrator of Northern Rhodesia recommended last year that he should be authorised to promise to those natives who had worked faithfully as carriers a reward, at the end of the operations, which he suggested should take the form of a supply of simple agricultural implements, to assist them when resuming their work of cultivation on the land. The cost was estimated at about 25,000Z. The alternatives were the grant of higher pay, or the use of a greater measure of compulsion. It was considered that higher wages would not be so likely to produce volunteers as the encouragement afforded by the promise of future help, and while being more costly than the promise of implements, would not be so useful to the natives, as they would spend the money at once. The latter alternative was not favoured by those who knew the conditions best, and it wras indeed thought that a larger measure of compulsion might result in failure, or at any rate be attended with risks while the forces were away in East Africa.The wdiole matter of the rewards to be extended to the carriers has been under consideration by the War Office and the Treasury.NIGERIA.Forestry Conditions. An interesting review of the position of the forests and Forest Department of Nigeria by an ex-official of the Forest Service (Dr. A. H. Unwin) will shortly be published. In this it is stated that in the Northern Provinces there are about 25,000 square miles of merchantable timber forest, and probably in addition fully 100,000 scjuare miles of dry zone, orchard or acacia, scrub forest, with scattered merchantable trees here and there. In the Southern Provinces it is estimated there is an area of 40,000 scpuare miles of heavy forest, including the mangrove and other swamp forest areas. In addition there are probably 25,000 miles of dry zone of orchard forest. It is stated that, of all the provinces of Nigeria, the greatest exploitation of mahogany has taken place in Benin, while in the lowest reaches of the Cross River are to be found the finest mangrove forests of the whole country. Of the classes of wood, it is stated that mahogany, chiefly obtained from the Khaya species, has been the most valuable tree, and next in importance is the African teak, or rock elm, a tree which takes the place of oak in African economy. As to the ebonies, which are found in various parts of the country, it is stated that one of the reasons why the Calabar, or Nigerian ebony, realised a lower price than that from the Camaroons or Gaboon was because the billets were cut very much smaller in size, thus preventing large articles being made from them without making a great many joints afterwards.
The best camwood trees have long since been cut down; but satinwood is a common tree- of the Benin Province.At the head of forestry affairs in Nigeria is the Chief Conservator of Forests, who lays down the general forest policy for the whole country, and acts as Inspector-General. There is also a &quot;Working Plans Division&quot; corresponding with the Intelligence Department in military affairs, where plans are made for the permanent working of the various reserves and for collecting special data.There is a Senior Conservator of Forests in charge of the Northern Provinces as well as of the Southern, and each of the administrative units is farther divided for forestry purposes into circles embracing two or three provinces. One of the most important functions of the Forest Department is to replant when the forest is cut, or to see that the forest is used in such a way that it may reproduce itself in a given time.Until the war broke out, the Forestry Department was quite, self-supporting, and had paid over 10.000Z. above expenditure into the Treasury. In addition to that&apos;it has its hundreds of acres of teak and other plantations worth at least 50.000LFOREIGN COLONIES IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.Dr. Solf on Colonial War Aims. The German Colonial Secretary (Dr. Solf), in opening a series of lectures at Munich University on September 30th, made some important references to the war aims of Germany in connection with Africa. According to German Wireless, Dr. Solf referred to the importance of the colonial idea and demonstrated, in the course of his speech, &quot; that Germany could not and ought not to renounce under any circumstances her systematic colonial policy ; that this colonial policy and the possession of colonies were an absolute necessity to the survival of the German Empire, if Germany was not to be crushed between the gigantic Empires of Great Britain, the United States and Japan.&quot; Dr. Solf stated that the German colonial war aims were : &quot;the return of the German Protectorates in Africa and the Pacific, and the union of German colonial possessions in Africa into an economic whole.&quot; He emphasised the fact that the Government were holding fast to these colonial war aims, and he ended with the assurance that &quot; Germany had never pursued, was not pursuing, and never would pursue a policy of might, but a colonial policy directed solely towards economic aims. The economic union of the colonial territorities in Africa would certainly lead to a fresh distribution of this continent.&quot;Economic- Reasons for Colonial Possessions. German Wireless of October 1st deals with the allegation that Germany will use her colonies as submarine stations, and asserts that &quot;more than once Dr. Solf has declared, plainly and clearly, that, German)- does not want to get back her colonies for reasons of world-power, but solely in order to. possess within the regions of the tropical zone a field for her economic activity, such as England and France possess to an unequally large extent. More than once Dr. Solf has declared that Germany, even after the war, will pledge. herself that militarisation of the black hemisphere shall be avoided, that coloured peoples shall not be used as gun fodder in Africa and Europe, and that Germany is entirely sympathetic towards the further cultivation of the idea such as has been laid down in the Congo Act.&quot;The German Wireless goes on to state that the enemies of Germany do not want any agreement about colonial problems, or to recognise&apos; the rights of Germany in oversea regions. The statemeut continues: &quot;How can such plans be compatible with the idea of a union of. nations ? Germany takes seriously the question of a union of nations, and knows that in such an international combination of the future there is neither a place for coloured armies nor for submarine stations which threaten peaceful commerce.&quot;
