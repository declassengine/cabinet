SECRET.APPRECIATION 0V THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 87.PART I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The Labour Congress has been concerning itself with both war and after-war problems. The decision to issue a manifesto on reconstruction to the workers may have the effect of uniting political Labour interests in a wide policy of social and economic reform. The attitude adopted by the majority of the Congress in regard to the non-release of conscientious objectors is indicative of the strongly patriotic element in Canadian Labour.The law, which has hitherto been held, in abeyance, relating to the prosecution of all strikers who are engaged in industries of public inrportance is to be vigorously enforced, and it will be interesting to observe the results.The establishment of the Naval Air Service in Canada must not be confused with the arrangements outlined in Report No, 81 relating to the formation of the Canadian Air Force in England for military purposes.The question of Dominion representation on Committees dealing with Allied interests raises the whole question of a single voice speaking for the British Empire. The solution suggested may surmount present difficulties, and a good deal may be done, no doubt, by representation wdthin Departments ; but the broader issues involved are of fundamental importance.Other points of interest in this Report relate to certain phases of production.Australian Commonwealth.The meeting of Parliament has again concentrated attention upon the attitude of the Labour Opposition towards recruiting. It will be interesting jto see how far the Labour split wdll bring about increased snpport of the National Government. The programme of the Parliamentary Session presents a very practical appearance, and it will be seen that the needs of returned soldiers and industrial organisation are not forgotten.The War Loan Campaign has been taken up with remarkable vigour, and a strong appeal is being made to national sentiment.The proposal in the House of Representatives to give the Speaker authority to delete from Hansard ail references likely to prejudice relations wdth Foreign Powers is no doubt an outcome of the differences which arose some time ago between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments regarding the seizure of the Queensland Parliamentary debates which contained anti-conscription matter. (Vide Report No. 60.)      &quot; .    .The Queensland Government are to make another attempt to abolish the Upper House in that State. This may eventually involve the discussion of some important constitutional points before the Privy Council, for, owing to the last Referendum
9 mlbeing in favour of retaining the Legislative Council, the matter was not finally dealt with by the highest Court of the Empire when the subject came before them this year.The clumsy attempt made in German Wireless to meet allegations about German cruelty to natives with counter allegations concerning the Australian treat-meat of the indigenous population, will deceive no one who is at all acquainted with the careful, and even elaborate, manner in which the Commonwealth Government attend to the needs of the people in the native reserves.Sodth Africa.The loss of the Gahoay (Jastle by enemy action has evidently had a stimulating effect upon recruiting, and has brought home to the people of South Africa, who have not hitherto suffered much trouble in this direction, the reality of the German menace.The observations of Mr. F. S. Malan are no doubt intended to meet the Nationalist argument that the constitution of the Empire has recently been altered without the consent of the South African Parliament..   India. (Excluding External Affairs.)The Sedition Committee Report has not yet been issued in this country, and therefore the summary that is given in this Report, though necessarily much curtailed, is of interest as showing something of the origin and scope of the revolutionary move-ment throughout the country, and the recommendations made by the Committee.Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.dhe measure &quot;providing for compulsoiy service in Southern Rhodesia has met with some opposition from sources where obstruction to the proposals of the Chartered Company is normally apparent. The Ordinance is limited to defence of the territory, and is apparently popular amongst all but a section of Matabeleland farmers.The recent decision of the Privy Council relating to the ownership of Rhodesian land may affect the scheme for providing free grants of land for soldier-settlers.The reference of the German Colonial Society to the demand made before the war by certain English authorities for the extension of German territory in Africa might appear to require some reply. It should be borne in mind, however, that the demand Avas made as part of a settlement in Europe ; and it wras apparently -due-to the strong Criticisms of the German treatment of natives contained in Mr. Harris&apos;s book, Dawn-in Darkest africa, which caused the German authorities to refuse to sanction its translation and publication&apos;in Germany in 1912.H. d&apos;E.September 26th, 1918.

PART   I. -BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.. CANADA.. Meeting of Parliament. Though, no official intimation Las yet been given, reports from Ottawa indicate that Parliament will not reassemble till the New Year. The Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) is leaving Ottawa shortly for a holiday of two or three weeks. Mr. N. W. Powell and Mr. J. A. Calder are at present in the West on matters concerning their Departments.Labour Congress and Reconstruction; Conscientious Objectors ; Women s Wages, &amp;c. At the Trades and Labour Congress Annual Convention&quot; now in session at Quebec it was .decided to authorise the executive council to draft a manifesto containing a declaration of principles for a programme of reconstruction after the war. This is intended to serve as an instruction to the workers of Canada, governing , their auctions in regard to future efforts for the. establishment of better social and economic conditions.The Congress.further recorded its opposition to petitioning the Government to release conscientious objectors who have been sent to prison under the Military Service Act. , This matter was considered on a motion in favour of liberating conscientious objectors so that they could help in the food production by working on the farms. The Committee on Resolutions recommended non-concurrence in the motion. After a vie-orous debate, the report of the Committee was upheld by a vote of 99 to 90, -        &quot;A Resolution was passed by the Congress in favour of the establishment of a $12 weekly minimum wage &quot;for women in the Dominion. Efforts were made by Western trade unionists to secure endorsation of a plan for reorganising wrorkers in the Dominion along industrial lines instead of upon craft lines as at present, but this proposal was defeated by the Congress.In the election for the Presidency of the Trades and Labour Congress, Mr. J. 0. Waiters was beaten by Mr. Thomas Moore of Niagara Fails by 155 votes to 195. Mr. Walters was, however, appointed fraternal delegate to the British Trades and Labour Congress, and delegate to the Labour Peace Conference.Prosecution of Strikers in War Industries.-^-T-he Industrial Disputes Act is to be carried out more effectively than heretofore, and the Dominion Police have been put in charge of its enforcement. It is against the law to strike in a public utility or war industry unless recourse has been had to a Board of Conciliation and Investigation.. This section of the law has never been enforced, but it is intended that Its provisions shall be carefully executed in future. It has therefore been decided to give&apos;.the Chief of the Dominion, Police authority to lay a complaint and institute a prosecution when the law has been violated.Dominion Representation on Programme Committees. -The Dominion Govern -ment have been informed by telegram that the matter of Canadian representation on the Sugar Programme Committee has been further considered. It is pointed out by the British Government that the principle of formation of the Programme Committees is-equality of representation for British, French, Italian, and United States interests, and if separate representation shouldbe given to the Dominion, it is believed that the Allies would object on the ground of over representation of British interests. It is therefore proposed that the Dominion Government should appoint a representative to attend meetings of the Sugar Programme Committee, in order to advise as to Canadian requirements,&apos;but that the voting power should be left to the representative of the United Kingdom. - ;. .&apos; - &apos;
Naval Air Service.-The Naval Department announces that the establishment of the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service is now completed. Discipline in the new force will be the same as in the Canadian Navy. Bases have been chosen at suitable places, and a number of cadets have already joined and are now training as flight officers. (For the Military Air Force arrangements, vide Report No. 81:)Horses for the Army. Canadian horse-breeders desire that the animals for use in the Overseas Military Forces of the Dominion should be exclusively purchased in Canada. A deputation of prominent horse-breeders, headed by Mr. G. J. Headley, leader of: the Alberta Opposition, and Mr. William. Smith, M.P. for South Ontario, have visited Ottawa to lay their case before the authorities. In the past, horses for the Canadian Forces have been bought by the Allied War Purchasing Commission, and financial conditions have favoured purchase in the United States.Grain Crops. The Dominion Statistics Bureau have issued a preliminary report of.the estimated average yields per acre of the principah grain crops in Canada. The following table gives the average yield in bushels per acre this year for the whole of the Dominion, together with the yield last year, and a 10-year average from 1908 : 1918.	1917.	10-year - average.16-1-12 -1 o 2M	21-k 15i 30i 23	23 19 &quot;    :   35 27Fall wheat Spring wheat Oats &quot;Barley - -liecord in Wooden Shipbuilding. The Canadian record for speed in wooden ship-building which was held by Quebec has now been surpassed by Victoria, B.C. The War Camchin, a wooden ship of 3,100 tons, built for the Imperial Munitions Board, was launched from the Foundation Company&apos;s. shipyards at Victoria on August 31st. The installation of machinery was commenced at the Imperial Munitions Board&apos;s. plant on September 3rd, and the work was completed in 12-J-working days. On September 17th a successful sea-going test was held, and it was arranged that the vessel should commence loading cargo within seven days of thatAUSTRALIAN&apos; COMMONWEALTH.Parliamentary Programme:.&apos; At the commencement of the Parliamentary Session the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) outlined the Sessional programme on September 20th. -After remarking on the encouraging character of recent information from the war, Mr. Watt said the Government observed with pride the important part played by Australians, and congratulated the nation on the cheering fact that casualties were light. The prosecution of the war to a victorious end was still the prime duty of Parliament and the nation. Arrangements for the voluntaiy recruiting ballot were nearing completion. The work of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy at the Imperial War Cabinet and the Imperial Conference;had been of the /utmost consequence to the future of the Commonwealth. They were now, he -said, endeavouring to remove great difficulties surrounding the sale and shipment of Australian products.The members of the French Mission, Mr. Watt continued, were welcome guests. The Government trusted that their visit would cement the enduring ties between the -great Republic of France and Australia. Mr. Watt added that the Government recorded their pleasure at their successful efforts to secure the return on furlough of veteran Australian troops embarked in 1914. .     .As to the proposed legislation for the Session, the Acting Prime Minister said the Government intended to make the Session a business one. Standing orders would be introduced to expedite public business. The growing financial burdens -necessitated additional taxation. The following Bills are to be introduced : (1) To :provide for the housing of returned soldiers. (-2) To co-ordinate the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth and States, and to provide preferential voting for the House, of Representatives and postal voting. (.3) To provide for the statutory ananagement of Government steamers.   (4) To secure equitable contributions by the
people to war loans in accordance with their means, (a) To place price-fixing on a more satisfactory basis than under the War Precautions Regulations. (6) To give effect to the promise made by the Government at the Shipbuilding Conference and to the agreements with unions. (7) To give effect to a scheme for the creation of a Science and Industry Institute. (8) To provide for the control of waters in the &quot; vicinity of naval works and arsenals. (9) To encourage the manufacture of black steel sheets and galvanized iron sheets.   (10) To amend the Naval Act, &amp;c.The Leader of the Opposition I Mr. Tudor) secured an adjournment till the following day, and Mr. Watt announced that he would deliver the Budget speech on September 25th.Party Meetings. -Prior to the assembly of the Commonwealth Parliament for the Session, the usual meeting was held of the Federal Ministerial Party on September 17th, when the acting Prime Minister outlined the main financial taxation proposals. The newspapers forecast an increase of 35 per cent, in &quot;the income tax, making a total increase of 60 per cent, since.the war began ; an increase of 20 per. cent, in the land tax, a halfpenny war postage tax and new revenue duties ; increases on luxuries ; an amendment of the wartime profits tax with a view to encouraging new industries and affording, relief to the base metal industries.The Opposition Party (Official Labour) also met and discussed the recruiting ballot and adjourned the debate for a fuller meeting.Hansard Debates and Relations with Foreign Powers. The Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr. Littleton Groom) has given notice in Parliament to move a resolution authorising the Speaker during the war to delete from Hansard such reports as may be considered by the law officers as likely to affect adversely the relations between Great Britain and foreign powers.War-Loan Campaign. The. war loan campaign (vide Report No 82) was launched throughout Australia on September 18th. In Melbourne its opening was marked by a stirring appeal &quot;by Mr. Watt, the Acting Prime Minister, outside the Town Hall, in the presence of an enthusiastic crowd. Troops paraded with three war tank models. Mr. Watt pointed out that the Government was asking the people for 10,000,000?-. to finance Australia^ war obligations for six months. Already the Commonwealth had spent 210,000.000?. of war loan naouey, some being subscribed in Great Britain. The term of this loan was five years instead of 10 as with past loans ; the interest was nominally 5 per cent, but actually equivalent to 5J per cent. It wras subject to Commonwealth but not State taxation. Vigorous and spectacular efforts were, made in the State capitals to bring the campaign into prominent notice.Queensland Upper House. The Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) has given notice for the introduction of a Bill to amend the Constitution so as to provide for the abolition of the Legislative Council.   (Vide Report No. 59.)-French Mission. The French Mission has had a triumphal tour of New South Wales, and the newspapers have devoted a great deal of space to the visitors. At a dinner given in Sydney by the French Consul-General, the Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holman) made a remarkable speech in which he compared the democracies, of France and Australia. He said that he Avas comdnced, from a study of Australian politics during the Avar, that Australia would have done better and played a nobler part if she had had a dictator. She Avould ha ve done better if there had been less freedom, and less consideration for the individual citizen ; but in France, where there was a great free democracy and no dictator, the people had risen in the hour of crisis to. confront- a common peril with, sacred unanimity. It was the example of France which held out hope for the future of humanity. Had there not been a democracy like that of France, ready on the instant to arise, the power of England and the United States would never haA-e been manifested in this war.Shipbuilding Profits. The Minister in Charge of-Shipbuilding (Mr. Poynton), replying to a question in the House of Representatives, said that the arrangement between tin: Commonwealth Shipping Board and the inter-State shipping companies was for the Board to pay rental to the companies for the use of their ships, above-e which the profits on freights and passages belonged to the Commonwealth.
oRegulation of Meat Prices. Mr. Massy Greene, Assistant Minister in the Federal Government, has announced the details of the new scheme for regulating meat prices. The wholesale rates during the export season will be based on export prices with a small addition, probably a farthing per pound, to enable the butchering trade to compete with exporters. The prices during the non-export season would be fixed for both fresh and frozen meat. Purchases by the meat administration during the export season would ensure a supply of frozen meat to guard against an acute winter shortage. He proposed to communicate with the Imperial and Indian Authorities to ensure that all negotiations for canning contracts should pass through the hands of Sir Owen Cox, the Meat Controller, in order that future prices might be co-ordinated with frozen rates, thus placing carcase and canned meat exporters on the same level.German Allegations as to Treatment of Natives. In the course of efforts to meet the allegations contained in the Blue Book on German South-West Africa, statements are made in German Wireless of September 19th regarding the alleged &quot;systematic destruction of natives in Australia and New Zealand.&quot; The account proceeds: &quot;In Tasmania the native, under the administration of the Governor, Arthur, h*ad been in some measure exterminated. English soldiers and settlers made drives over the whole island and also hunted and shot down natives as they did the kangaroos. The few who escaped this death were taken to Flinders Island, where, owing to the unheaLthy climate, they soon died out. The whole of theTasmanian race had been exterminated by the year 1878. Moreover, from Northern Queensland the protector of the natives in his annual report of 1908 wrote that in Queensland the natives had, with the knowledge of the English Government, been slowly exterminated. Those who are in the service of whites generally receive gin for Avages or no wages at all, and tliey are used as intermediaries for the sale of gin. Their women are prostituted, and when they haA^e children these are removed from their parents and compelled to work.   Similar deplorable conditions obtain in Western Australia,&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.Torpedoing of the &quot; Galway Castle.&quot; The Prime Minister (General Botha) has issued the folloAving message :-&quot; On behalf of the Government I Avish to express my abhorrence of the action of the Germans in torpedoing the Galway Castle and causing the death of so many peaceful citizens of South Africa. I Avish aiso to express my deep sympathy Avith the families and friends of those whose liA-es haATe. been so unnecessarily taken. The inhuman conduct of the enemy will strengthen the resolution of South Africa to give eA-erv assistance to bring the war to a successful end.&quot; &apos;      .     &apos;The Johannesburg correspondent of the Central News telegraphed on September 16th that the torpedoing of the Galway Castle had aroused the&apos; bitterest-resentment throughout South Africa, which hitherto had suffered little from German submarine piracy. The outrage, however, is expected to result in many hundreds of new recruits ; indeed, the correspondent says, it can be regarded as the best recruiting stimulant received by the Union and Rhodesia since the sinking of the Lusitania and the murder of Nurse Cavell.A great meeting of Cape Town citizens was. held on September 22nd, at which the Mayor presided, when resolutions were passed expressing sympathy with the relatives of those who had lost their lives &quot; through Germany&apos;s brutal and inhuman crime,&quot; and recording.gratitude to the British Navy for its heroic- rescue work as Avell as admiration for the- services of the mercantile marine.Constitutional Questions. The Minister of Mines and Industries (Mr. F. S. Malan) in addressing a meeting at Mahnesbury dealt with the republican propaganda contained in the speech delivered here by Dr. C. W. Malan, the Nationalist leader in the Cape Province, on September 1st, and said: &quot;Dr. Malan pointed out that the Constitution had already been changed, but he confused the issue, as he should have differentiated between the Constitution of South Africa and. the Constitution of the British Empire. Further,&quot; said the Minister, &quot; Dr. Malan should kuoav that the Imperial Conference has decided to postpone consideration of Constitutional changes until after the war.&quot;6465-4   . B
Accumulation of Bank Deposits. The quarterly bank - statements published in the official Gazette afford evidence of the rapid accumulation of deposits. In the three months ended June 30th the total deposits in the banks increased by more than 2 500,000L Since the outbreak of war the total increase in bank deposits is over 25 000,000?., or 70 per cent., while advances made to customers have risen by 7 250 000L, or 23 per cent. only. In 1914 these advances amounted to 931- per cent, of the total&apos;deposits, whereas to-day the proportion is only 65 per cent,INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)SEDITION COMMITTEE REPORT. ,Introduction. In the Introduction to the Report of the &quot; Sedition Committee, 1918,&quot; presided over by Mr. Justice Rowlatt, it is pointed out that Republican or Parliamentary forms of Government, as at present understood, were neither desired nor known in India till after the establishment of British rule. In the Hindu State the form of Government was an absolute monarchy. When the East India Company began to trade, the greater part of the country was under Muhammadan rule, but in the middle of the 17th century this rule began to weaken. The Maratha leader, Sivaji- led the Marathas of Western India against the Muhammadans, and a Hindu kingdom was formed by Sivajbs grandson in the Bombay Presidency, of which the chief ministers were Brahmins. Before long the Brahmin minister and his descend-dants became the rulers of the Deccan, with the title of Peshwa, and had their court at Poona. The particular caste of Brahmins known as Chitpavaus obtained, under their rule, most of the administrative posts. The Chitpavan Government was, however, overthrown by the British early in the 19th century, and the Brahmins lost their commanding influence. It was among these Brahmins of the Poona districts that (the Introduction points out) the first indications were found of a revolutionary movement. - -Bombay. --The Report deals with the histor*y of the revolutionary conspiracies in Bomba,y, and points out that Poona has remained the headquarters of the Chitpavan Brahmins in Western India, who have furnished Bombay with its two best political thinkers, Rauade and Gokhale, and . the Poona Press with its most influential journalists, Tilak and Paranjpe.The account of the revolutionary activity shows that all conspiracies were Brahmin and mostly Chitpavan.Bengal. The Report traces the revolutionary movement in Bengal, and points out that the partition of the Provinces in 1905 brought previous discontent to a climax, and enabled Hindu politicians to organise their movement with the object of procuring a reversal of the obnoxious measure, alleging that Bengali nationality&apos; would be divided. The record of revolutionary crime and its development, particularly during the years 1906 to 1917, is dealt with in the Report. It is pointed out that the activities of. the conspirators were limited by the restricted supply of arms. As to methods, it is interesting to observe that the conspirators studied Russian revolu-tionary methods, and in their propaganda they cleverly associated the religious and.political aspects from, the point of view of so-called Indian Nationalism. Abundant evidence convinced the Sedition Committee, that the Secondary English Schools and, in a less degree, the Colleges of Bengal, have been regarded by the revolutionaries as their most fruitful recruiting centres.German Plots. The Report discloses a connection dating from 1911 between German agents and leading Indian revolutionaries in America. Soon after war broke^ out, a young Tamil, as President of a body in. Zurich called the International Pro-India Committee, applied for permission to publish anti-British literature in Germany, and established the headquarters of the &quot;Indian National Party&quot; in Berlin attached to the German General Staff. The Germans employed the Indians in the production of anti-English literature, and later in other duties.
/ ... .The Report &quot;gives details of the definite schemes of the German General Staff so far as they depended on co-operation with the Non-Muhammadan population of India. The scheme, which depended on Moslem disaffection, was directed against, the North-West Frontiers, but the other schemes, which relied upon co-operation with the Ghadr party of San Francisco and the Bengali revolutionaries, and are described in the Report, centered in Bangkok and Batavia, the former depending chiefly upon returned Sikhs of the Ghadr party, and the latter upon the Bengalis. Both the schemes were under the direction of the Consul-General for Germany in Shanghai.The German attempts to ship arms to assist Indians in a revolution are outlined in-the Report, and the conclusion is reached that the revolutionaries concerned were far too sanguine, and that the Germans with whom they got in touch were very ignorant of the movement of which they attempted to take advantage.Bihar and Orissa. The Province of Bihar, and Orissa (which was formerlv included in Bengal) has been, the Report points out, only slightly affected by the revo 1 u tionary movement.The United Provinces.  The revolutionary moArement in the United Provinces has not taken hold of any section of the people, though, as the Report states, the position and the circumstances (of Benares will always render that city a point of peculiar peril.The Central Provinces. The Report calls attention to the two resolutions passed at the Calcutta Sessions of the Indian National Congress in December 1906, the first of which approved the boycott movement inaugurated in Bengal as a protest against partition ; and the second of which expressed the opinion that the s\^stem of Govern-ment obtaining in the self-governing Dominions should be extended to India. Though there was considerable friction between the Moderates and the Extremists of Nagpur, and troubles occurred in 1908, the Central Provinces did not come into contact with dangerous movements until February 1915, when, through firm action taken in time, mischief was arrested.Punjab. The Report, points out that of the Pumjab&apos;s population, 55 per cent, is Muhammadan, 33 per cent, is Hindu, and 11 per cent, is Sikh, and that it has for j^ears been by far the most fruitful recruiting ground for the Indian Army. After dealing with &quot;the events of 1907 and 1909, the Delhi conspiracy case of 1912, &amp;c, and the Budge-Budge riot of 1914, the Report points out that in 1915 the Govern-in eiuy of India realised that in the Punjab and Bengal the situation was cleepening in gravity and the Defence of India Act was therefore passed quickly through the Imperial Legislative Council. Its most important provisions (for the present purpose) were the appointment of special tribunals for the trial of revolutionary crimes. It allowed neither commitment proceedings to these tribunals nor judicial appeal from their decisions. The Lahore conspiracy trials are described in full, and the action taken to restrict dangerous characters.Madras and Burma. The seditious activity in Madras resulted in various trials in 1908, but, since the trial for the murder of Mr. Ashe there does not seem to have been any trouble from criminal revolutionary conspiracy in the,Presidency.As to Burma, it is pointed out that its population differentiates this from other Provinces. The Province has, however, been the scene of determined efforts to stir up mutiny among the military forces and to overthrow the British Government. Such efforts have originated in America, have been concentrated in Bangkok, and thence, with the assistance of Germans, have been directed from the Siamese frontier against Burma.The Population and Revolution. The Report points out that on an average of every 10 persons, seven are Hindus, two are Muhammadans, and one is a follower of some other religion. Muhammadans are, however, unevenly distributed ; in the North-West Frontier Province and in Baluchistan nine men out of every ten are Muslims ; in the Punjab and Bengal every second man ; in Bombay one man out of five, and in the United Provinces one man out of seven. British rule, however, followed closely on the clecaj- of Mussulman sovereignty, and the political importance of the Indian Mussulmans has always outweighed their numbers. The Report gives an account of a wild scheme of Muhammad an attack from the r^orth-West which has . little connection with any other cases in India, but links up with Berlin through Mahendra Pratap.Summary. The Report summarises the revolutionary movements as follows :  In Bombay they have been purely Brahmin and mostly Chitpavan.   In Bengal the6465 4a c
conspirators have been young men belonging to the educated middle classes. Their -propaganda has been elaborate, persistent, and ingenious. In their own province it has produced a long series of murders and robberies. In Bihar and Orissa, the United Provinces, the Central Provinces and Madras, it took no root, but -occasionally led to crime or disorder. In the Punjab the return of emigrants from America, bent on revolution and bloodshed, produced numerous outrages and the Ghaclr conspiracy of 1915. In Burma, too, the Ghadr movement was active, but was arrested.  .Finally came a Muhammadan conspiracy confined to a small clicpre of fanatics, and designed io overthrow British rule with foreign aid.All these plots have been directed towards one. and the same objective, the overthrow by force of British rule in India. Sometimes they have been isolated, sometimes they have been interconnected, sometimes they have been encouraged and supported by German influence. All have been successfully encountered with the support of Indian loyalty. But it is not surprising, the Report adds, that, in dealing with conspiracies so elusive and. carefully contrived, the Government have been. . compelled to resort to extraordinary legislation.Legislation required. Lastly, the Sedition Committee, after an interesting-analysis of the difficulties that have been met in bringing the criminals to justice under the law as it stands, offer advice as to the legislation necessary to enable the Government to deal effectively with the difficulties when the temporary legislation has lapsed. The Committee express the view that the measures taken under the Defence of India Act have not so broken the revolutionary movement as to make it safe to disregard the possibility of the conspiracies beiDg revived.The measures suggested are punitive or preventive. Legislation required for the former purpose includes changes in the general law of evidence and procedure and changes in the substantive law of sedition with modifications of the law of evidence.and procedure applicable to such crime only.In regard to the general law, they suggest the consideration of legislation to prevent irrelevant cross-examination of witnesses and a clearer statement&quot; of the law as to promises of protection if disclosures are made. As to changes relating to. seditious crime, the Committee recommend- a permanent enactment -on the lines of the rule under the Defence of India Act which provides for the punishment of persons^ having prohibited documents in their possession or&apos; control with intent to circulate them: The Committee also recommend that the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides for an order requiring notification of residence after release in cases of persons convicted a second time for certain offences, should be extended to persons convicted of offences against the State (under Chapter VI. of Penal Code). Further, the Committee considered that in all cases where there is a question of seditious intent, eAudence of previous conviction for seditious crime or association with persons so convicted should be admissible.As to emergencA^ punitive measures, the Committee make various recom-mendations, including the trial of seditious crime by Benches of three Judges without juries or assessors and without preliminary commitment proceedings or appeal (folloAving the lines of the Defence of India Act). They also advise that in such cases the accused should be allowed to give evidence if he so desires, and that perpetuation of testimony should be provided for.As to preventive^entive emergency measures, the Committee consider that in order to keep the conspiracies under control in the future, it is necessary to proA-ide for the continuance after the expiry of the Defence of India Act of some of the powers Avhich that measure introduced, in a temporary form, for by those measures alone, the Report states, has the conspiracy been paralysed for the present. The present powers of the Government are found in rules under the Act-which give authority to require persons by Executive order to remain or not to remain in any area, Avith penalties for breach of the requirement. But the Committee consider that nothing in the nature of conviction can be admitted Avithout trial in strict legal form. The Committee think that the powers to be acquired should be of two grades : The first group of powers should be of the following nature (i) to demand security with or without sureties ; - -(ii) to restrict residence or to require notification.of change of residence ; (hi) to require abstention from certain acts, such as engaging in journalism,distributing leaflets or attending meetings; (iv) to require that the person should periodically report to the police.
The second group of powers should be-(i) to arrest; -(ii) to search under warrant;(in), to confine in non-penal custody. *The Report then suggests that an &quot; investigating authority &quot; should be constituted to enquire in camera upon any materials which they may think fit and without being bound by Rules of Evidence. They would send for the person and tell him the. allegation, and investigate the matter as a domestic tribunal, no advocates being allowed. At the end of this enquiry, report, would be made to the Local Government, with whom responsibility for action would rest.Visiting Committees are also suggested in order to report upon the condition of persons restricted in residence or in Custody.The Committee conclude by suggesting the method of dealing with existing offenders, and of controlling ingress of conspirators into India and the passage of revolutionaries from Province to Province.OTHER COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RHODESIA.Compulsory Service. The Ordinance providing for the registration and com-pulsory military service of all males in Southern Rhodesia between certain ages, was passed by the Legislative Council in June last, but was not assented to by the High Commissioner (Lord Buxton) till August 21st. The introduction of the legislation was clue to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s appeal for men arising out of the German offensive in March, and the necessity of providing for the adequate defence of the territory owing to the lar-ge number of men who had volunteered for overseas service. The Ordinance lays down that all European.male inhabitants between 18 and 50, residing in areas to which the law is applied (which in practice involves the towns rather than the country districts) shall be liable for military service in the Defence Force, but members of the force are not compelled to serve beyond the limits of the territory. Further, the Ordinance provides for the compulsory training of boys between 12 and 18 in cadet corps. The registration of all males liable for personal service is to take place in all districts to which the Ordinance is applied. After the passage of the Ordinance through the Council, and before the High Commissioner^ assent was given, a certain amount of opposition was -manifested. This was evidenced recently in Bulawayo and centred mainly amongst a section of Matabeleland farmers who generally oppose themselves to the Chartered Company, but the malcontents had associated with them some &quot;of the disloyal elements of the Dutch population (the total Dutch: population of Southern Lihodesia is abmt 15 per cent.). The opposition was based rnainby on the ground that the Legislative Council was not representative of the people and that a company formed for commercial gain was not a proper authority to initiate legislation of this character. Allegations were also made that men could be conscripted and sent to France, which, of course, is mot the case, as will be seen from the above particulars. On the other hand the feeling of the population in favour of the Ordinance was shown by resolutions carried at large public meetings at TJmtali and Salisbury and at many gatherings of Farmers&apos; Associations, including that of Mashonaland.Land for Soldier Settlers.  The scheme of land settlement for discharged soldiers and sailors formulated by the directors of the British South Africa Company in 1916, involved a free offer of land in Rhodesia amounting to 500,000 acres, of which hall-would be in Northern and half in Southern Rhodesia. The idea was to select the ex-soldiers or sailors in London from those who would be able to have at their command, during the first two years of occupation, a capital of 1,000Z. The land would be divided into farms of adequate and convenient size which would depend on local conditions, but which would average between 1,500 and 2,000 acres,
arid facilities would be afforded for receiving service settlers as pupils on farms in order to give them opportunities oh learning the business of farming. It was contemplated that the scheme would not only benefit ex-soldiers and sailors, but would introduce a very desirable type of British settler who would be of great benefit to the country both economically and politically. The recent judgment of tbe.Privy Council,, however, declaring that the unalienated land of Southern Rhodesia is not the propert)-of the Company, but of the Crown, which, on its side, is bound to reimburse the. Company for its out-of-pocket expenditure upou the administration of the territory, may affect the carrying out of this scheme.GERMAN SOUTH-WEST AFRICA.German Colonial Society and South-West Africa Blue Book. German Wireless of September 24th states that &quot;in reply to the English Blue Book, which endeavours to create a feeling favouring the surrender of German Coionial possessions to-England, by pointing out the alleged failings of German&quot; Colonial officials, the German Colonial Society has issued &apos; a declaration which savrs : &apos; Nothing demon-strates more obviously the aim and dishonesty of British propaganda than the fact that it is partly carried on by people like Sir Harry Johnston and Missionary Harris, who, on the ground of an intimate knowledge of German Colonial administration, were in favour before the war of an enlargement of German Colonial possession in Africa at the cost of France, Belgium and Portugal. In 19141 Harris demanded this increase of territory specifically in the interests of au improvement in conditions for the natives, and maintained the assertion that if the choice were left to them they would decide for Germany in the French and Belgian Congo.&apos; &quot;1 Apparently reference is made to Mr. Hai*ris&apos;s book, Dawn in Darkest Africa., published in 1912.
