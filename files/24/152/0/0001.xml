SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 70,PART I,-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.. Canada.The intervention of the Government in the railway dispute seems likely to have a salutary effect. Apart from the important influence of these Labour difficulties upon Canadian development, this particular dispute is of special interest; the conditions prevailing in the United States have been quoted a good deal in the course of the discussions. The GoA*ernment is said to contemplate taking over the Patriotic Fund. An announcement is made about pay and allowances for discharged soldiers- and sailors.Australian Commonwealth.The most interesting matter in the week&apos;s news from the Commonwealth, relates to the attitude of Labour towards the war. The extremist section in the JSfew&apos; South Wales Labour Council has indicated clearly where the disloyal elements exist.It is interesting to note that the returned soldiers have formed themselves into a political federation, and that this, body is likely to exercise considerable influence upon the future political situation.Other items of interest in the Australian news concern the formation of a Fleet Reserve, progress of shipbuilding, and the work of the Repatriation Department.South Africa.The statement of General Botha has made clear the relationship between the Nationalist conspiracy and enemy influence. General Botha&apos;s statement merits attention ; the South African Press comments on the situation are worth studying.The reports about, the native difficulties on the mines show an improvement, and the attempt at a general strike seems to have failed.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)A summary of the momentous recommendations on Indian Constitutional Reform is given in this Report.   The summary is intended, to make clear some of the more
important recommendations; it includes not only points ^iven in the official summaries, but also a few items from the full Report&quot;]&apos;tself.Foreign&quot; Colonies.The references to the return of the German Colonies appearing in the Kiilnische volkszeiLurig are of interest.July 11th, 1918.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Economic Defensive.-!^, a memorandum on the United States and the Economic Defensive, dated June 29th (G.T. 5018), the Political Intelligence Department deals with the question generally, and points out the advantages of&quot; a lead being given by the British Empire at the present stage. &quot; . o .       -SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.Labour Situation. A Labour situation which threatened to be one of the most menacing ever experienced in Canada has been relieved, at least temporarily, through the intervention of the Government, and a strike which threatened to tie up the entire railway system of the Dominion has been averted.Negotiations have been conducted during the past two months between federated trades committees representing 50,000 railway employees and the Canadian Railway War Board, over the demands of the men for an increase of wages amounting to many millions of dollars. The companies, had resolutely declined to accede to these demands.Matters assumed an acute phase when the federated trades presented a sharp ultimatum to the Railway Board for a final answer to the men&apos;s demands. The Government thereupon stepped in and ordered the employees&apos; committees and the Railway War Board to confer with a sub-committee of the Cabinet. Both sides obeyed the summons, and the Cabinet first heard the case for the men and then the reply of the companies. . To both sides the sub-committee tendered counsel, and when the conference broke up, Mr. C. J. Doherty announced that there was every reason to expect that the differences would be amicably adjusted. The men involved in the dispute include mechanics, carpenters, painters and shop men generally on all Canadian roads, both Government and privately owned. They are at present working under a complicated classification, and they asked to be grouped into three classes, the pay to be 75 cents an hour for the first class, 62-J- cents an hour for the second class, and 56 cents an hour for the third class. The increases demanded amount to nearly 100 per cent., which the companies declare to be wholly exorbitant. The railway companies tentatively proposed that the McAdoo award in the United States might be applied, providing a minimum wage of 55 cents an hour, with increases in specially skilled trades, but the men rejected the offer, holding that the schedule is involved and difficult to understand, and more favourable to employers than to workers. They further - state that the McAdoo schedule is not yet accepted by railwaymen in the United States. The high cost of living is the principal reason for the demands given in the employees&apos;representations. The negotiations are proceeding at Montreal and both sides are showing a more conciliatory spirit since the intervention of the Government.Pay and Allowances for Discharged Soldiers. The Department of Soldiers Civil Re-establishment has just made an important announcement regarding pay and
allowances of discharged soldiers and sailors who are undergoing treatment at hospitals of the Invalided Soldiers Commission.. Under an Order in Council, a new scale has been fixed, by which a man will receive exactly the same pay and allowances which he was drawing prior to his discharge, with one or two slight variations. Dependants will receive the Militia or Naval scale of separation allowance, but a special scale in lieu of any allowances received from the Patriotic Fund has been fixed. The scale of treatment allowance applies also to men who after discharge break down owing to disabilities received in the war, and who come back to the hospitals of the Commission for treatment. These men will be &quot;treated as civilians and will not have to re-attest. Approximately 2,500 men are affected at present, bringing the total of those being paid by the Department of Re-es^ablish-inent to nearly 5,000. The new scale for &quot;dependants in lieu of the Patriotic Fund allowance is as follows: Wife only, $10 a month; wife and one child, S19 ; wife and two children, S26 ; wife and three children, S31 ; for each child in excess of three S5, with a maximum monthly allowance of S15. A man with dependants is required to assign at least 820 a month to such person, who will also receive the separation alhwvance given to the man when he was in the service.Government&apos;and Patriotic Fund. According to an announcement in Montreal, legislation empowering the Dominion Government to take over the Canadian Patriotic Fund and to furnish the funds hitherto subscribed through public and private sources is to be introduced - in the next session of Parliament. Members of the general executive of the fund at a recent meeting agreed that the greatly increased taxation in the last two years, the high cost of living, and numerous other calls upon private means as a result of the war, made it unfair to call upon the public to bear the burden of maintaining the fund still further.Sir Wilfrid Laurier. The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), who has been in poor health for the last fortnight and is confined to &quot;his home in the capital, has cancelled all engagements for the summer. The Opposition Leader has no constitutional ailment, the trouble having been diagnosed as malnutrition, resulting in general weakness. Sir Wilfrid is in his 77th year. It is evident that his present condition is due to fatigue following his constant attendance during the recent session of Parliament.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Labour and Disloyalists. The Commonwealth Press reports indicated last week that the New South Wales Labour split was daily becoming more pronounced. The Bread carters1 Union is the latest organisation to announce its withdrawal from the Trades and Labour Council.The leader of the extremist section of the New South Wales Labour Council,, Mr. E. E. ,1 ndd, w-as charged at the S&quot;vdne3r Central Police Court on July 2nd with moving a resolution before the Council encouraging disloyalty to the Allies&apos; cause, also with making statements prejudicial to reciuiting, and was committed for trial. He was also committed on two other charges of making statements prejudicial to recruiting.A mass meeting of returned soldiers and sailors at Sydney Town Hall passed resolutions viewing with disgust disloyal and seditious utterances, and requesting the Minister for Defence to give power to State commandants to deal promptly with disloyalists who are interfering with recruiting.The Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) interviewed on arriving in Melbourne from West Australia, said there could be no more gross lie than to say Labour was for surrender.No Peace by Negotiation. The Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holman), speaking as President of the First Annual Conference of the National Association of New South Wales, said there could be no peace by negotiation at the present moment.Returned Soldiers&apos; Political Federation.- The delegates of returned soldiers&apos; national parties from New South AVales, Queensland, and Victbria, meeting in Melbourne, have agreed to a form of constitution for a federated body to be known as the Returned Soldiers&apos; Political Federation&quot;.
Formation of a Fleet Reserve. The formation of a Fleet Reserve for Common-&quot;wealth seagoing forces has been approved. The force will consist of seven-year service men of the Royal or Australian Navy, enrolled for five years and liable by proclamation for active service.   The maximum age of enlistment is 4-5 years.Progress of Shipbuilding. The Acting Minister for the Navj- (Mr. Poynton) has announced that shipbuilding was proceeding- at Williamstown and Walsh Island, . and preparations were being pushed on in other States. But where yards had to be constructed it was obvious a long time must elapse before ship construction was actually started. The important thing was that a beginning had been made. Ten yards would be in operation in various States with 31 slips. In some States the Government were building ships, but the bulk of the work was by contract. Where the Government were doing the work, there were still delicate negotiations with the Unions! The Government were offering bonuses to private contractors to expedite construction. The Australian workman, Mr. Poynton stated, had shown he could, more than hold his own with the workmen of other countries, and would soon have the opportunity to compete in a world-wide shipbuilding competition.The Federal Government has settled with the New South Wales Government the main terms of an agreement for the building of six ships at the Walsh Island yard. They will cost between 160,0001. and 170,000/. each.Commonwealth Balance Sheet. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has made available the Commonwealth- Balance Sheet for the year ended June 30th. Ordinary revenue was 36,396,833Z. ; the estimate was . 35,181,655/.. Ordinary expenditure was 34,897,2911., the estimate having been 37,283,832/. The balance carried forward totalled, 3,576,969/., including 2,077,427/. from the previous year, surplus for last year being 1,499,542/. War charges paid from revenue were : Interest and sinking-fund for war loans, 7,798,956/. ; war pensions, 2,770,839/, ; repatriation, 200,000/. ; trading vessels, 998,000/. ; other war services, 67,752/.; total, 11,835,547/. Customs and Excise revenue was 15,610,287/,&apos;, being 2,388,487/. below the previous year. Postal receipts increase from 5,498,517/. to 5,766,637/. Income tax produced 7,397,381/., being 1,4-82,381/, above the estimate. War-time Profits Tax produced 079,740/. ; and trading vessels, 1,622,408/., the cost of the service being 998,000/.Work of Repatriation Department. The Repatriation Department has issued a statement showing that from April 8th to May 25th, 5,442 applications had been received for employment ; 5,777 positions had been offered ; 4,459 positions had been filled ; 2,927 positions were sought. On May 25th, 1,318 applications had been received for vocational training; 484 were approved, 331 refused, and 212 were pending. The 675 men now in training were classified as follows : -62 in wood trades, 68 in leather trades, 137 wool trades, 101 in clothing trades, 13 in books and printing trade, 294 in other callings ; 15,984 applications had been received for assistance in other than vocational training, and employment for 13,191 approved.SOUTH AFRICA.Nationalist Conspiracy and Enemy Influence. In connection with the Nationalist conspiracy to raise an armed revolt (vide Report No. 75), the Prime Minister of the Union (General Botha) issued the following statement: &quot;As Prime Minister of the Union, I feel it nry duty to place before the j)people a state of affairs in our Union of which everyone should know. The people must be aware of the state of tension now prevailing, a tension not necessarily following on the political activities of the various political organisations, but other agencies have for some time been at work to bring about trouble in view of the disturbed political and industrial situation of the country. I therefore desire to inform the people that there is good reason for suspecting that enemy agencies are at work in this &quot;country, and that they are intriguing to stir up strife, not on by amongst Europeans, but also amongst Natives, and- no means or methods are deemed too despicable as long as they can attain their object. Whilst it is not desirable in the public interest to publish details of events which in the last few days have necessitated prompt effective  military and  police measures  and which, had such   measures
not been taken, would have culminated -in grave disturbances and probably serious loss of life. 1 may state that the Government had information pointing to the existence of a movement having for its object the subversion of the con-stitution by methods of&apos; violence. I am convinced that South Africa is no more likely to be immune from the insidious attentions of enemy agents than are the other Dominions or :the countries of -Allied or neutral Powers. The result of the activities of such instruments of the enemy has from time to time become clearly apparent, and circumstances attending the disturbances in Ireland in 1910 represented several features which have been observed in the movement on foot in South Africa. The people of South Africa are ho strangers to trouble and difficulties which they have often overcome by resolution and self-control, and the Government makes this statement in order that all orderly, peace-loving citizens may be warned that mischievous elements are at work amongst them, and that it is their duty neither to countenance nor encourage, even indirectly, such attempts at mischief. I have been gratified to see the appeals made by the leaders of political and industrial, organisations to their supporters to abstain from violence. These should assist the country and people to withstand attempts to create disorder. As the Prime Minister of the Union, 1 wish in the most earnest and emphatic manner to add my appeal &quot;to each and everyone, from the highest to the lowest, of. whatever political persuasion he may lie or to whatever industrial organisation he may belong, . to regard this matter as of the utmost importance to himself and the country and to be continually on his guard against this demon of intrigue, and to use his utmost endeavours to curb the unruly passions of those who think that something is to be gained by sowing discord and exciting strife. While the administration of the country is committed to my government it is determined ,to take all necessary measures to counteract these intrigues and.I feel confident that in this task it will have the assistance and support of all good citizens.&quot;The effective military and police control undertaken by the Government were referred to in the Gape Times of July 3rd as follows :  &quot; Just as the prompt action of the Irish administration frustrated the German plot in May, so we are certain that public opinion in South Africa will, in a similar emergency, support General Botha&apos;s Government in dealing drastically with the situation which has arisen. The worst of the danger is over, thanks to the prompt and effective police and military measures, but the danger may recur, and will recur unless the measures taken bring to book the enemy agencies which are endeavouring unsuccessfully to plunge South Africa anew into bloodshed and disaster. The fact that these agencies are working in enemy interests, will go far in itself to assure Government support by all who love South Africa in whatever measures it may see lit to take to preserve the peace and security of the Union.&quot;The Cape Argus cordially applauds General Botha&apos;s prompt action against &apos; the demon of intrigue.&apos; &quot;Another armed rebellion,&apos; it says, &apos; had been plotted, but the plans of the conspirators, whatever they may have been, were upset by the vigilance of the Government. Nevertheless, we shall have enemy intrigue as long as the war lasts. Every effort should be made to lay hold of the conspirators. Let it never be forgotten that the enemy plotters aim at making South Africa in future an appendage of the German Empire.&apos; &quot;Native Difficulties on the Mines. Peports from South Africa confirm that the difficulties with the natives (vide Report No. 75) was largely due to a number of young natives of: European education who had been influenced by a group of International Socialists. Several of the last-named have now been arrested. The Vice-President of the South African Native Congress (Saul Msame) issued a manifesto urging the natives to have nothing to do with the strike, and to approach the employers in a proper manner. Though the trouble was of a local character, and affairs are now settling down, the trouble at the Ferreira Deep Mines was more serious than at first indicated. &apos;1 three thousand five hundred.natives refused to go underground, but committed no overt act. Military and police entered the compound with fixed bayonets and took possession of a large number of sticks and similar weapons which had been hidden away. The presence of weapons is not unusual, for the natives invariably secrete sticks, &amp;c., in case of tribal affrays or for self-defence. The natives submitted calmly and did not intervene when 71 ringleaders were arrested.   These natives subsequently appeared in Court charged6073-2a - c
with public violence in the compound and were remanded. The mine officials appear confident that the trouble has been surmounted, and that the apparent movement.,for a general strike of natives lias totally, failed. ,-&apos;The message of the Prime Minister (General Botha) to the natives, which was referred to in the last Report, stated; that he was grieved and concerned to finch in circulation all sorts of: rumours, not merely, of unrest but even suggesting , the participation of the natives in a possible violent disturbance. General. Botha said that he could hardly credit this in view of the splendid behaviour of the natives of the country during the four years of war, and he was convinced the wise influence oh the chiefs and leaders would he maintained. General Botha detailed the steps taken as regards the strike last month, and stated that the terms of reference to the Commission were precisely the same as in the case of the recent European strike. General Botha having learned that there were other grievances exercising the minds of the natives of the Rand, intimated therefore that he was prepared personally to meet at an early d^te the representative leaders of the natives, and hear direct from them what their grievances were. At the-same time, he wished to counsel the natives to be on their guard, lest-&quot;they should be misled by the&quot;advice of irresponsible persons, European, and others, whose real object was not the promotion of the well-being of the native people of South Africa.Cliauc.es for Native Advancement.  Mr. Patrick- Duncan, member of the Union House of Assembly for Fords burg, Transvaal, speaking on July 3rd at, Johannesburg, declared that &quot;to shut down such a population as our natives and to sit on til6 safety valve was bound to lend to a disastrous explosion.&apos;&apos; He continued: These people should gradually be given an opportunity of improving their position and utilising their abilities, and that is going to be no1 merely the salvation of the native people but the salvation of the white man too. We must also see that the gates of South Africa, are thrown wide open to European immigrants who would be useful citizens, and that land is tin-own open to them,&quot;INDIA.(Excluding external affairs, irliicli are deal! iinlli, in llie Eastern.Report.)Constitutionnl Reforms.The Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms signed jointly bv Mr. Edwin Montagu, Secretary of State for India, and Lord Ghelmsford, the Viceroy, at Simla on 22nd April, last, was presented to Parliament (Cd. 910!)) last week. The proposals include a great extension of local self-government so as to train the extended electorates; a substantial measure of self-government in the provinces; develop-nients for better representation of Indian needs and desires in the Government, of India and the All-India legislature ; machinery for fuller knowledge in Parliament ; and means for continuously enlarging, in the light of experience and at regular stages, the element; of responsibility to Indian electorates..Attention is called in the Report to the important announcement in the House of Commons on the 20th August last regarding the policy of &quot; the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire.&quot;The Report is the result, of a thorough investigation pursued by Mr. Montagu and others in India undertaken in association with the Viceroy, and it is published in pursuance of the pledge given on the 20th August, that; ample opportunity would, be afforded for public discussion of the proposals.Morley-Minto Reforms. The Report surveys the administrative and legislative system in India and discusses the effect of the successive stages of political advance known-as the Morley-Minto reforms effected in 1900, The conclusion is reached that they afford no full answer to Indian political problems. Power, it is pointed out, remained with the Governments supported by the official bloc and the plan afforded no room for further advance along the same lines
&quot; Parliamentary usages,&quot; it is observed, &quot;have been initiated and adopted in the councils up to the point where they cause the maximum of friction, but short of that at which, by having a real sanction behind them, they begin to do good. We have at present in India neither the best of the old system nor the best of the new.&quot;Popular Control in I^ocal Bodies. The British Government having decided on the policy of marching by successive stages to Indian self-government within the Empire, the Report reviews the conditions of the problem of the first steps and refers to the scheme of reconstruction put forward by the Indian National Congress and the All-Indian Moslem League. The objection to this scheme is stated to be that it involves a legislature responsible to the electorate, and a distribution of power which would enable the legislature to parabyse the executive without having power to remove it. Apart from this, it is mentioned that the success of the plan would be the negation of the ultimate aim, namely, responsible government.For starting India on the road to responsible government, the beport states that &quot; there should be, as far as possible, complete popular control in local bodies and the largest possible independence for them of outside control.&quot; &apos;Provincial Independence. The line of advance ^recommended by the Report is summed up in the following words of paragraph 189 : &quot; The provinces are the domain in which the earlier steps towards the progressive - realisation of responsible government should be taken. Some measure of responsi-bility should be given at once, and our aim is to give complete responsibility as soon as conditions permit. This involves at once giving the provinces the largest measure of independence, legislative, administrative and financial, of the Govern-tiient of India which is compatible with the due discharge by the latter of its own responsibilities.&quot;The recommendations on the above lines apply to all the major provinces except Burma ; while, for strategic reasons, the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan must remain entirely in the hands of the Government of India.The sidjstantive proposal of the Report is that in each province the executive Government should be a composite authority. One element in it would comprise the head of the province (to be known as Governor, though this common designation would not imply any equality oE emoluments or status, both of which would continue to be regulated by the existing distinction), and an executive council of two members. One of these would in practice be a European qualified by long official experience, and the other would be an Indian. The Governor in Council would have charge of &quot; reserved subjects.&quot; Another element in the Government would consist of the Governor and of one member, or more than one member, according to the number and importance of the &quot; transferred subjects,&quot; chosen by the Governor from the elected members of the legislative council. They would be known as ministers, and would be members of the executive Government, but hot members of the executive council ; and they would be appointed for the life-time of the legislative council.The Government thus constituted would deliberate generally as a whole, but the Governor would haAre jDOwer to summon any member or members of his Government to deliberate with him separately. Decisions on reserved subjects, and on the supply for them in the provincial budget, would rest with the Governor and his executive council; decisions on transferred subjects and the supply for them, with the Governor and the ministers. The matters included in &quot;transferred subjects&quot; would vary in each Province and would include those affording most opportunity for local knowledge and social service, such as, for example, local self-government, rural and urban; education, primary, I secondary, and technical; public works; excise;-development of local industries, &amp;c. The subjects not transferred would be considered as &quot; reserved.&quot; The aim in view is the devolution of responsibility for transferred subjects, and--then, by gradually increasing this devolution by successive stages, to ultimately reach complete resiDonsibility.The enlarged provincial legislatures will differ in size and composition from province to province ; but each will possess a substantial elected majority sent there by direct election on a broad franchise, with such communal and special represen-&apos; tation as may be necessary. The franchise and the composition of the legislatures is to be determined by regulations to be made on the advice of a committee, consisting of a chairman appointed in England, two officials and two Indian non-officials, the draft regulations to be laid before Parliament.6073-2a C
\The Report argues that there are: good reasons for not dispensing entirely with the official element in the legislative councils.For the purpose of assisting the provincial Government to get through its legislation on reserved subjects, certain steps are recommended ; and in the important sphere of finance, the system of &quot; divided headg &quot; is to disappear iu order to effect a complete separation between the Indian and provincial heads of revenue. The provincial Governments are to be given certain powers of taxation and &quot;borrowing hitherto withheld, and the budget is to be laid before the legislature.Central Legislature. While recognising that the Government of India must remain wholly responsible to Parliament, the Report recommends that the Indian Legislative Council should be enlarged and made more representative. It is submitted that the central legislature should be bifurcated, and the existing body should be. known in the future as the Legislative Assembly of India, and raised to a total strength of about 100 members. Two-thirds of this total should be elected, and of the third to be nominated by the Viceroy, not less than a third again should be non-ofliciiils selected with the object of representing minority or special interests. To the committee for drawing Tip electoral schemes already referred to will be committed the task of submitting proposals foi;: determining the electorates and constituencies. It is recognised that there must be some special representation, as for European and Indian commerce, and also for the large landlords. , -The second chamber, to be known as the Council of State, is to take its part in. ordinary legislative business, and to be the final legislative authority in matters which the Government regards as essential. It should consist of 50 members, exclusive of the Governor-General, 21 to be elected and 29 nominated. Of the latter four must be non-officials. The life of each Council of. State is to be quinquennial, but the Governor-General is to have power to dissolve either legislature.Assent by both bodies will be the normal condition of legislation. Ordinarily a Government measure, if passed by the Assembly, will be sent to the Council of State. If the latter amends the Bill in a manner unacceptable to the Assembly it will lie submitted to a joint session of both Houses, unless the Governor-General in Council certifies that the amendments introduced by the second chamber are essential to the interests of good government,Privy Council and Council of Princes. Two new bodies are proposed, one being an Indian Privy Council, which would be confined to those who had won real distinction, or had held or who were holding the highest offices, and the other a Council of Princes, which would replace the Conference held iu recent years at the invitation of the Viceroy.Control of Parliament. The Report states that, in proportion as the foregoing-changes take effect, the control of Parliament and the Secretary of State over the Government of. India and the provincial Governments must be relaxed. Machinery is proposed whereby the substantial steps in the direction of responsible government may be carried farther in the course of time.The Report indicates that the conception of the eventual future of India is that of a sisterhood of States, self-governing in all matters of purely provincial interest, and. presided over by a central Government, increasingly representative of, and responsible to, the people of all of them, dealing with matters, both internal and external, oi: common interest to the whole of India. The Report considers it possible that the Native States will wish to be associated for certain purposes with the organisation of British India in such a manner as will not involve loss of individuality.Views of Sir S. P. Sinha. The delegate of the Government of India to the Imperial War Cabinet, Sir S. P. Sinha, has expressed his views upon the above Report, and states that the Report is a considerable improvement on the Congress-League scheme in two essential particulars, viz. : &quot; (1) Inasmuch as it provides adequate machinery for the political education of the people from the very start ; and (2) as it ensures periodic examination of the political situation at definite intervals for the purpose of further advance, and invests the popular representatives with responsibility for certain important branches of administration at once.&quot;
FOREIGN  COLONIES.Iieturn of German Colonies : German View. A writer in the Kolnische Volks-zeitung of June 21st makes some interesting references to the capture of German territory by the Dominions. After observing that for four years General von Lettow-Vorbeck has upheld the German flag in East Africa, the article proceeds : &quot; We make this special reference to the heroism of General von Lettow in order to make it clear to Englishmen that the German people has no intention of giving up a colony which has been defended with such bravery and such success. The English Press has recently at a wink from a higher quarter played variations on the theme that, however the war may end, there can be no question of a return of the colonies to Germany. They say that it was not England which took the German colonies. Rather was it the South African Union which took German South-West and East Africa, Australia which took New Guinea and the Bismarck Islands, and New Zealand which captured Samoa. It is not therefore in the power of England to return these colonies. If the Germans want their colonies again let them go direct to the independent Commonwealths of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.&quot; Do the English really think we are going to be taken in by this dodge ? It was England who declared war, and the colonies entered the war as parts of the British Empire. If England fails in this war, and the feeling that victory is impossible is increasing amongst the English people, there will be ways and means of compelling England&apos;s possessions South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand to give us back our colonies.&quot; All the Teutonic tribes are one in the resolve not to let go the war until their economic existence is assured. The first condition of this assurance is the restoration of our colonies.&quot;Sir S. P. Sinha observes :  &quot; I am confident that when this Report has been fully &quot;and. carefully considered in India the bulk of the people will recognise that for the first stage on the road to self-government the recommendations go a substantial distance.&quot;Internal Conditions.Political Outrages. It is officially reported to the Government of India that there has been a recrudescence oji political outrages in Punjab and Bengal. Otherwise nothing of political importance has occurred.
