SECRET.APPRECIATION OP THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 89.PART I.-BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The influential Press organs of the Dominions are strongly opposed to the favourable consideration of the German peace proposals. The extremists, associated with the Nationalists of French Canada, with a section of Official Labour in Australia, with the Labour Anti-Conscriptionist element in New Zealand, and with the Nationalists of South Africa, will no doubt be found to adopt their own peculiar lines.Canada.The arrangement for the exchange of prominent political speakers between Canada and the United States for the purpose of supporting the respective war Joan campaigns is a notable example of the close relationship that is developing between, the two countries.The appointment of a Director of Public Safety to act with Committees in various districts of the Dominion shows an appreciation by the Government of the peril of the alien enemy who acts through the I. WAV. aud other dangerous agencies.Though the Dominion Minister of Naval Services apparently does not wish to commit the Government to his recent statement on naval policy (vide Report No. 85), there is little doubt that the view he gave represented that of Sir R. Borden and most of his colleagues.Other points of interest in this Report relate to the &quot; Khaki University,&quot; the training of disabled men, the cost of living regulations, &amp;c.Australian Commonwealth.The offer of H.M.A.S. Brisbane to the Admiralty for general service shows a continued appreciation as to where the real defence of Australia lies. The Report-on Navy Administration will involve changes in the personnel of the Navy Board and probably an increased effort in ship construction.The ballot of the Labour Unions as to whether Labour shall make participation in recruiting dependent upon an Allied policy of peace without annexations or indemnities appears likely to be treated, with apathy. In this case the position of the pacifist leaders in the Official Labour Party will be considerably shaken.The power which has now been given to the Speaker to delete from Hansard passages likely to prejudice relations with foreign Powers will prevent the use of Parliament as a field for pacifist propaganda.[p.t.o.
The representation, of Australian commercial interests iu the United States and the consideration of French representation in Australia, both emphasise the growing international interests of the Commonwealth. ; ;Other matters of interest in this Report relate to the proposed aerial mail service between Australia and the United Kingdom, the training and housing of incapacitated soldiers, and the position of Arbitration -courts in enforcing their awards.New Zealand.The large anti-conscripticnist Labour majority at the Wellington (Central) bye-election cannot be considered as representative of feeling in the country. The seat comprises the poorer districts of Wellington, and though originally held by the conservatives, it was captured later by the Liberal-Labour forces, largely owing to the result of the strikes and the- unpopularity of police action in connection with them.South Africa.Some details of the Governments scheme for providing intending settlers with land and assistance are given in this Report. The Crown lands available are, of course, strictly limited in&apos; extent. It will be recalled that the Nationalists strongly opposed preference being given to soldiers.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The reasons for refusing facilities to the Home Rulers to visit England this year-have been clearly explained in the Imperial Legislative Council. Other proceedings of interest have occurred in the Council.Foreign Colonies in Africa.A fuller account- of Dr. solf&apos;s utterance of September 30th shows a strong-emphasis on the economic side and a plea for tbe &quot; open door.&quot;II. d&apos;E.October 1.0th, 1918.

PART  I.   BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Press and Peace Proposals. The newspaper Press throughout the Dominion in general show a strong opposition to the favourable consideration by the Allies of the German peace proposals. Many take the line that there should be no cessation of hostilities until more substantial guarantees of the sincerity of the. proposals are forthcoming. The observations of the Toronto Globe may be considered typical, viz., &quot; With her dream of world-power shattered and the whole structure of her mad ambition falling in ruins around her, Germany seeks to stay her downfall by a carefully calculated gesture of surrender. The first reaction among the Allied nations must be immediate and decisive rejection of the armistice proposal.&quot;War Loan Campaign : reciprocal Arrangements loith United States. The Dominion Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) opened the Victory Loan campaign in Winni-peg on October Sth, when he appealed for a minimum subscription of 8300,000,000.The proceeds of the loan will be used for war purposes only and spent wholly in Canada. The rate of interest is 51- per cent, payable on May 1st and December 1st, and bonds are issued in denominations of 850, $100, 8500, and 81,000, offered in two maturities of 5 and 15 years. Sir Thomas White stated that the outlook for the success of the loan was most promising. He referred to the savings deposits and stated that agriculture was prosperous, business active, wages high, and that there was no unemployment. The national spirit, he added, was resolute for the continued prosecution of the. war.Reciprocal arrangements have been made between the statesmen of Canada and the United States for speakers to visit each country in order to help in the respective loan campaigns.. For example, upon the invitation of the United States Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. McAdoo), Sir George Foster has left for Ohio to speak for the Liberty Loan in that State. A number of other leading Canadian public men have also been invited by the United States authorities to assist in the loan campaign. In addition, many returned officers and men have been given permission by the Canadian authorities to proceed to the United States in order to help. It is understood that by way of reciprocity a number of prominent Americans, including at least one member of President Wilson&apos;s administration, will visit Canada to assist in the Victory Loan campaign.Naval Policy. The Dominion Minister of Naval Services (Mr. C. C. Ballantyne) in visiting Halifax last week to consult with Admiral Storey as to the naval defences of the city and the Atlantic coast, referred to the statement he recently made at Montreal (vide Report No. 85) that he believed Canada would soon have a strong naval policy of her own. The Minister stated that the Government had not yet given this important matter their consideration, but he was satisfied that when they did so the policy would receive the approval of Parliament and the country in general.Director of Public Safety. An Order-in-Council has been passed and is now awaiting the signature of the Governor-General, appointing Mr. C. II. Cahan, K.C., Montreal, Director of Public Safety for the Dominion. Although no official announce-ment of the appointment or of the functions of the new official has been made, it is understood that the Director will be the head of Committees of Public Safety which will be appointed locally in districts where the alien enemy element is considerable. The duty of the Committees will be to protect the community against enemy propagandists and organisations of Bolshevik tendencies, such as the I.W.W. Members of such Committees will be asked to serve without remuneration, although the new Director of Public Safety will have under him a number of officials of a professional character, whose efforts are designed to ensure thejsafety of citizens and property during the period of the war.
Inter-Allied Conscription. It is estimated that 25,000 young Italians, Greeks, Belgians, and Frenchmen resident in Canada will be available for military service under the new treaties now being negotiated between Canada and those countries.Exemption&apos; of Farmers. -The Government are now making provision for the continued exemption throughout the winter months of all men now possessing exemption as farmers. . A notice to this effect states that this action is rendered necessary in view of the importance of leaving on the farms a sufficient number of men actually contributing to the national-food supply.Railicay Employees, Increases of wages aggregating over $22,000,000 annually have been granted to the employees of Canadian railways by the Railway War Board.A flat rate of increase has been adopted by the Board instead of the somewhat complex schedule of the McAdoo award, which last July the Board undertook to- put into effect in Canada.Cost of Living Regulations. On the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, new cost of living regulations have been laid clown by the Government, materially, extending the scope of the existing regulations. These provide for extended facilities of investigation and the publication of fair prices, while prosecutions by municipal committees or the Minister of Labour are authorised, in addition to the present method of prosecution by provincial Attorney-Generals.Contravention of the regulations involves liability to a penalty not exceeding $5,000 or to two years&apos; imprisonment, or both fine and imprisonment.The Khaki University. The Khaki University has been placed on an official and permanent basis, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Overseas Military Forces, and an Order-in-Council has been passed establishing a -Department of Educational Services for the Overseas Military Forces of Canada. The Department, which will be a branch of the General Staff, will be under a Director of Education, responsible to the Overseas Minister. The Director will be responsible for the efficient organisation and administration, including the control of personnel, and he-will be assisted by a Deputy. An Advisory Senate will meet periodically and advise upon matters of policy. The educational organisation in England and France will each be under an Assistant Director of Education. - Such civilian personnel as is considered necessary will be employed and given honorary rank.The cost to the Canadian Government, exclusive of separation allowances, is estimated at approximately $363,000.Training of Disabled Men.1 -The Department of Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-establishment provides free training for soldiers whose wounds or illness contracted on active service render him unfit to return to his pre-war occupation. The soldier also receives maintenance allowances for himself and. family during the period of training. The Department arranges for a neat card to be handed to every wounded or invalided returned soldier, which sets out plainly the advantages he can claim. Though in existence for only a comparatively short time, the department is training 3,000 men for about 200 occupations.Women&apos;s Aid Department. In order to meet the shortage of man-power, the Militia Department, in co-operation with the St. .lohn&apos;s Ambulance Brigade overseas, have authorised the establishment of a Women &apos;s Aid Department for service in military hospitals throughout the Dominion. Members of the new service will wear the uniform of the Brigade,&apos; and nurses will sign on for six months and other members for 12- months.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Offer-of II.M.A.S. &quot; Brisbane.&quot; The Commonwealth Government have offered H.M.A.S. Brisbane2 to the Admiralty for service abroad. It is stated in the telegram of offer that the cruiser could be fitted with tripod masts and latest appliances while in home waters.1 Vide also Report No. 76.   For Australian and New Zealand arrangements, vide Report No. 86. 2 H.M.A.S. Brisbane is a light cruiser of 5,400 tons displacement and 25,000 h.p.   She  carries eight 6-inch and four 3-pounder guns..
Navy Administration. The Report of the Royal Commission on Navy Admini-stration and the Cahinet&apos;s decisions thereon have been presented to Parhament. The Cabinet decided to adopt the recommendation to give effect to Rear-Admiral Sir William Cresswelbs desire to retire from the position of first Naval member. The Navy Board will be reconstituted with the Minister for the Navy as President, three naval members, a business member and a finance member. Other important recommendations are deferred pending the return of Sir Joseph Cook, Minister for the Navy.Parliament: Preferential Voting and Institute of Science.-A Government Bill, introduced in the Federal Parliament to amend the elections law, provides for preferential voting for the House of Representatives and the restoration of postal voting.Several ministerialists in the Senate opposed the Bill to establish a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry on the ground of expense; but the second reading w*as carried.Labour Ballot on Peace Negotiations. In connection with the ballot of the Unions as to whether Labour participation in recruiting should be made conditional on an Allied policy of no annexations and no indemnities (vide Reports Nos. 81 and 85), it is reported in the Press that many Unions have refused to take part in the ballot. In consequence the officials who favour the ballot have issued a circular expressing the fear that the ballot may be so small as to look ridiculous.Hansard Debates and Relations with Foreign Powers. The motion of the Commonwealth Government in the House of Representatives providing for the omission from Hansard, at the SpeakeFs discretion, of remarks considered Ivy the Crown Law Officers to be prejudicial to relations with a Foreign Power or to the successful prosecution of the war. or to Imperial safety or that of the Commonwealth, has been carried by 32. votes to 14. The vote was on parry lines (vide Report No. 187).War Loan: War Precautions Regulations. The following War Precautions Regulations have been issued : (1) declaring it an offence to make statements likely to prejudice the war loan; (2) preventing persons and Societies or Associations after November 1st accepting money on deposit at a higher rate than 4-1- per cent, per annum, without the Treasurer^ consent. The latter provision is designed to stop undue competition between the bank rates and the return from war loan investments.Aerial Mail Service.  Sydney business men are endeavouring to form a. company, with a capital of 500,000L, to establish an aerial mail service between Australia and Great Britain. It is stated that the journey can be covered in 150 hours.Commonwealth Representation in United, States. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has announced that Mr. Hughes has advised that the British Government have accorded official recognition to Mr. H. Y. Braddon as the representative of the Commonwealth in the United States of America.French Representation in Australia.- The commonwealth newspapers state that the members of the French Mission are considering the question of the appointment of a French Trade Commissioner for Australia. A series- of Conferences have been arranged to enable the members of the Mission to consult on the commercial interests of the two countries.Training and Housing of Incapacitated Soldiers (vide also Reports Nos. 86-and 88;. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Alillen), addressing the General Presbyterian Assembly last week, said that the average time that a returned soldier who wras fit for employment remained on the books was twro weeks, and that less than 3 per cent, of the discharged men were unemployed. This result was achieved with the co-operation of employers. Two thousand three hundred and fifty-five men who were not able to follow pre-war occupations, he said, were being trained in special vocations ; doubtless all would be able to earn the standard wage. Eighty technical classes had been established. &apos; Applicants for land totalled 4,765, but only 1,600-
had been dealt with. He had convened a conference of State Ministers of Lands, and was hopeful to improve matters.&apos; The staff of the Repatriation Department consisted of 95 per cent, of returned soldiers.Senator Millen in an earlier speech stated that industries for partly incapacitated soldiers must not come iuto competition with other industries, and he asked what &apos; would be said through men losing employment ou account of a soldier&apos;s state-subsidised industry.   He preferred, he said, to find new industries.   One of three he had recently discovered involved investigations in America.   He hoped to complete the purchase of-the plant within the next fortnight.The Minister, explaining the housing scheme, said a soldier could pay for a period of years as tenant, the amount being credited to interest, and the balance being set off against capital outlay. A soldier, after the probationary period, might have capital credited to him and complete the purchase on the credit foncier system, or after pajonent of rates and damage, have the balance of capital returned. An inde-.pendent authority would control the scheme.Atistraliahs in Action. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) in a recent speech said it was nothing derogatory to other troops to declare that in the recent German offensive not a single Australian Division or Brigade had retreated a yard. Australia had 300,000 men through the firing line. Often in tight corners they fought against long odds, but in the whole course of the war only 3,334 had been taken prisoner. These were mostly wounded, but Australians in a single day&apos;s fighting had taken more than that number of German prisoners.Report on Training Camps, &amp;c-The report of Mr. J. C. Manifold, M.P., on the training camps and convalescent depots and hospitals of the Administrative Head-quarters in England, states that he is pleased and impressed with the excellence of the whole organisation.Arbitration Courts and Enforcement of Decisions. A majority of the Full Bench of the High Court of Australia has decided in the case of the Waterside Workers against Alexander, Ltd., that the arbitration is constituted within the authority of Parliament in regard to arbitral provisions, but bej^oncl the authority of Parliament regarding its enforcing power, This decision governs other cases. The enforcement of awards is left to police courts and other tribunals.The Minister for Labour in New South Wales (Mr. Beeby) commenting on the judgment said the effect was that the whole power of effectual arbitration reverted to the State tribunals. The Federal Parliaments&apos; industrial power was purely concilia-tory. The Federal Court could continue to investigate disputes and make awards, but only with the concurrence of both parties, and enforceable only by the weight of public opinion.NEW ZEALAND.Press and Peace Proposals. Commenting on the German peace proposals, the Dominion says that it is impossible to bring this offer within a reasonable, distance of what the Allies could accept. The New Zealand Times calls the proposals &quot; German bluff &quot; and demands that the same answer be given as Bulgaria received. The Post says that &quot; bargaining with an unrepentant Germany would be a compromise with the evil which we are out to destroy/&apos;Wellington By-Election : Anti-Conscription Success. The result of the by-election rendered necessary by the death of the Liberal Member for Wellington Central has been announced in the Press, and indicates the return of the anti-conscription Labour candidate, who polled 2,665 votes. The Independent Labour candidate polled 1,044 votes, and 784 votes were cast for the Ministerial candidate. There were three other candidates, who polled 223 votes. The percentage of the. electors who polled was 51, as compared with 84 at the General Election.War Loan Subscriptions. A statement has been issued to the effect that the Dominion War Loan subscriptions exceed 40Z. per head.6633-2a B
SOUTH AFRICA.Land for Settlers. In connection with the facts recently given as to the facilities afforded in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for discharged soldiers and sailors to take up land in those Dominions (vide Reports Nos. 83 and 86), the following official notes are given relating to provision for land settlement in South Africa.From time to time Crown land is made available for settlers under settlement conditions. The main classes of holdings are stock farms in the Transvaal and in certain districts of the Cape Province and Zululand ; small holdings on irrigation settlements ; small holdings on dry land, &amp;c. As to the stock farms in the Transvaal, it is pointed out that excellent opportunities for cattle breeding are to be found in the Pietersburg, Zoutpansberg, Rustenburg, and Waterberg districts, but that in the areas where the Crown lands are situated agriculture cannot be carried on successfidly through insufficiency of rainfall. Cotton growing is, however, developing rapidly. In the district of Gordonia (Cape Province) surveys of large areas bordering on the Kalahari Game Reserve and along the Kuruman and Molopo Rivers are being made. Subdivision is also proceeding of a large tract of land along the Oup River north of &quot; Rietfontein.&quot; The farms are from 10,000 to 15,000 morgen and successful sheep and cattle farming can be carried on. In the District of: Kuruman, sheep settlers are successful. In the Vryberg and Mafeking districts sheep do well, the farms ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 morgen in extent. In Zululand, the survey of farms of 1,000 to 1,500 acres at Umtam-banana, suitable for large stocks and in parts for sugar-cane, is proceeding. As to small holdings on irrigation settlements, the Vlakplaats Settlement in the Carolina District (Transvaal) will be completed this year and comprises 25 holdings, each averaging 10 morgen under irrigation from the Elands Spruit. This is on the main line from Pretoria to Delagoa Bay. The soil is suitable for wheat, oats, citrus ; while stock should do well. Settlements on the high veld in the Transvaal, North Eastern Orange Free State, and Northern Natal Provinces are laid out from time to time as land is acquired by the Department. The holdings range from 100 to 250 morgen of good arable land and are within easy reach of railways, markets, &amp;c. Settlements will be laid out during 1918 in the districts of Rustenburg and Standerton (Transvaal), Klip River (Natal), and in V rede and Harrismith (Orange Free State).The tenure granted is generally a live years&apos; lease which carries an option of purchase at a price fixed when the lease is made. No rent is payable during the first year ; 2 per Cent, per annum calculated on the purchase price is paj-able during the second and third years ; 3-J- per cent, per annum, also calculated on the purchase price, is payable during the fourth and fifth years. The lease may be renewed for a further five years, in which event rent becomes payable at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum, calculated on the purchase price. The purchase price of a holding may be paid at any time, but the settler cannot obtain a transfer of the holding into his name until after a period of 10 years from the commencement of the lease.Settlers holding leases from the Government under the Land Settlement Act, 1912, may apply for assistance to enable them to develop their holdings. The Department may, on the recommendation of a Land Board, advance 2501. to a settler for purchasing stock, implements, and equipment. Advances are repayable within a period of five years, interest being charged at 4-g- per cent. The Land Department may also assist settlers to acquire privately owned agricultural land for their personal occupation, provided the purchase price of such land does not exceed 1,5001., and provided the settler contributes not less than one-fifth of the purchase price.The Land Department has established a training farm for prospective settlers in the Standerton district of the Transvaal, and similar farms will be established elsewhere. All allotments are recommended to the Minister of Lands by the Land Boards which meet in Capetown, Bloemfontein, Pretoria and Pietermaritzburg.Nationalist Press on Allied Successes. The leading organ of the Nationalist Press, De Burger, in commenting upon the Allied successes on the Western Front, makes the following remarkable observation: &quot;It is incomprehensible that the German Army, which has made such a strong stand for four years against great superiority in numbers, should now apparently all at once show itself inferior and be driven back in almost every place where the Allies attack. It seems, then, that the retreat of the Germans has another reason than military inability to withstand the armies pressing on them.&quot;&apos;
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Passports for Political Deputations. A Resolution proposing that the Govern-ment of India should take immediate steps to urge His Majesty&apos;s Government to allow National Congress and All-India Moslem League deputations to proceed at once to the United Kingdom, was debated in the Imperial Legislative Council on September 25th and rejected by 34 votes to 8.Sir William Vincent, in opposing the Resolution, stated that the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India were that the scene of operations is for the moment in India, where the Committees on Franchise and Subjects will be working with a view to the completion of the reforms scheme. In view of war conditions no deputations ought to visit England this year, when Parliament will not be occupying itself with discussion of these questions. The Home Member undertook that in the coming year, provided the war situation permits, all possible facilities would be given to properly accredited representatives of all shades of opinions to visit the United Kingdom in limited numbers to place their views on the qmestions of reforms before the British public. In the meantime no concessions could be granted.Only one member besides the mover of the Resolution spoke for it, and the debate did not evoke much interest. The Moderates abstained from speaking.. Half the Indian members did not vote or voted against the Resolution.Imperial Legislative Council and Allied Armies. The Imperial Legislative Council unanimously carried a resolution of thanks and congratulation to the Allied Armies, moved by Khan Mahomed Shan. The Indian members denounced German militarism, the Punjab representative, amid loud cheers, expressing the hope that the war would be finished on German soil. All the speakers referred with pride and gratitude to the part played by Indian troops, declaring that the resolution was peculiarly appropriate in view of the news of the great victories in Palestine.Viceroy&apos;s Speech at Imperial Legislative CounciL-The speech of the Viceroy in closing the Imperial Legislative Council was telegraphed to the Press on September 26th, and the summary contains references to the Constitutional Reform scheme. The Viceroy is reported to have stated that the debates throughout had been informed by a spirit of co-operation which was the keynote of the reforms scheme. As to the Moslem community, he reminded their representatives of his words at the opening of the Session to the effect that he was content to leave the question of communal representation to a committee. Under the reform proposals a muhammadan-maclan member would be on the committee, and also on the committee dealing with the question of reserved and transferred subjects. The Viceroy declared that no one recognised the strength of Moslem claims more than he. Yet he had been told that a feeling existed among them that the Government was less mindful of their interests than in the -past. He had even been told that the unfortunate incident at Calcutta, the grievous death-roll of which he deeply deplored, was in some measure symptomatic of this discontent. If such a feeling were abroad he called on the leaders of the community in a spirit of co-operation to help him to dispel it.Earlier in the sitting Sir AVilliam Vincent, replying to a question regarding the Calcutta disturbances, stated that the Government were informed .that the situation there was now quite satisfactory.1Commissions for Indians. In connection with the grant of temporary King&apos;s commissions to Indians, 44 civil and military candidates have been nominated by the Commander-in-Chief and approved by the Viceroy for admission as candidates to the training school at Indore.1 The Calcutta disturbances occurred during the first half of September. As they were associated with the Muhammadan community, it is understood that reference is being made to them in the Eastern Report.6465-2aC
FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;c, IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.German Forces in East Africa. The officer administering the Government of Nyasaland has informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies, that the forces of General Von Lettow are estimated at 1-10 Europeans; 1,000 native troops including recruits, 2,000 other natives, 32 machine guns, and 500,000 ammunition. After an engagement ten miles west of Songea, the Administrator of German East Africa reported on October 8th that the enemy had proceeded northward.Dr. Solf on Colonial War Anns. A fuller report of Dr. solf&apos;s speech (on September 30th) than that given by German Wireless (vide Report No. 88) appears in the Kolnische V olkszeitung of October 1st. Dr. Solf made important references to the supply of raw materials, &quot; open door &quot; for trade, land for settlement, and militarisation of natives.   He is reported to have said : &quot; The regaining of our colonies is a task of national importance,, which is not eclipsed by any other.   The tropical and sub-tropical lands supplied 50 per cent, of all the raw materials for which we and our industries are dependent on foreign countries.   The present substitute materials cannot suffice for peace.   For the wool alone Germany would have to keep 50 million sheep, wdiich is practically impossible. The supply of raw materials, which wall be much more difficult in the future, is the wreakest point of our world economy.   Without colonies of our own we must remain dependent on the arbitrariness of foreign countries.    When war  broke out we wrere making excellent progress with our colonies.   We were able successfully to oppose monopoly attempts of other States.   Commercial treaties offer no guarantee. In the French colonies equality of treatment only existed on paper.   We, on the other hand, have adhered firmly do commercial freedom, which stills corresponds to our views.   We must make a breach in the enemy&apos;s endeavours to isolate us by means of our own coloni.es.   An open door for trade will be one of the most important demands at the conclusion of peace.   Even if the question of settlement in colonies has lost in importance since the decline of emigration, we nevertheless need land for settlement.   After, the unparalleled treatment which we have met there will be little inclination on our part to settle in foreign countries.    We scarcely equipped our colonies for defence, let alone for attack, like the French, who drew from their colonies 900,000 coloured auxiliary troops.   The employment of such slave armies in Europe is a crime.   We have no thought of militarising Africa.    On the contrary, we . desire-to prevent the employment of coloured men in Europe.   The fate of the world will in future no longer be exclusively decided in Europe. Enemy propaganda works amongst the credulous with the threadbare argument that our rule was one of the &quot; mailed fist.&quot;   Unaffected by the changing fortunes of war, we must even in a moment of depression not abandon our active colonial policy.   The Imperial Government adheres firmly to its demand for the return of our African and South Sea possessions, as well as a fresh  partition of Africa such as to consolidate our scattered possessions. Belgium, Portugal, and France possess excessively large stretches of territory.   We do not want the lion&apos;s share.&quot;Dutch Press and South-West Africa Blue Book. German Wireless of October 5th contains some carefully selected extracts from statements alleged to have been made in the Dutch Press regarding the Blue Book on South-West Africa (vide also Report No. 87).   The Wireless statement is as follows : -&quot; The Dutch Press rejects the statements of the English Blue Book regarding the alleged German cruelties in South-West Africa, so far as it has given the matter consideration, as a very transparent attempt to justify &apos; morally&apos; the annexation of the German colonies. The Nieuive van den Dag mentions the effect of the Blue Book in England- and the remark of the Daily Telegraph to the effect that nobody after reading it will ever listen to new arguments in favour of giving back German South-West Africa.   &apos; That is the gist of the matter.&apos;   The Nieuive Courant recalls
the fact that similar &apos; moral justifications&apos; preceded the conquest of Burma and the annexations of the Boer Republics, whilst the Arnhensch Dagblad remarks literally :  &apos; We know that the same song was sung in its time concerning the Belgian Congo at the time when England armed herself for the throttling of the.Boer Republics. The Boers were, at that time, psalm-singing rogues, executioners of Kaffirs and generaUy inhuman men. And now these same evil-doers who destroyed 27,000 women and children in their murderous concentration camps, burned down the houses of the poor Boers, exterminated their stock of cattle and then cried out on visiting their&apos; churches, &apos; 0 Lord,. I thank Thee that I am not like these African Boers,&apos; now employ the same methods in order to rob Germany of her Colonies.&apos; &quot;LIBERIA.Landing from West Africa. The Liberian Government have issued a notification that from October 4th passengers from Wrest African ports will not be permitted to land at Liberian ports. Vessels are likely to be put in quarantine for five days. This step has been taken on account of the epidemics on the &quot;West African coast which have not yet reached Liberia.
