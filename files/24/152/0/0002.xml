APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 77.PART I, BRITISH EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The question of the validity of the Order-in -Council cancelling exemptions raises a point of constitutional importance, which has already involved a conflict of authority between the military and civil powers. If the Supreme Court of Canada upholds the decision of the Alberta Court much confusion would inevitably occur, and a serious interference with the provision of reinforcements would probably result. In the event of the decision being confirmed, a special session of Parliament would possibly be summoned in order to pass the necessary legislation. The decision of the Supreme Court is, therefore, awaited with great interest.The troubles connected with the railway employes are still serious, but there-seems to lie a growing belief that the paralysis of the transportation system, which would be involved by a strike, will now be averted.The figures regarding enlistment in the Canadian forces during June are of interest.Australian Coabi on wealth.A statement of the Acting Prime Minister on rumours of the likelihood of Mr. Hughes staying in London should set at rest any doubts about this matter. The observations of Mr. Watt and the Commonwealth Press about ministerial representation in London are of importance.The formation of a club in Sydney, with the object of cementing British and Allied interests in the Pacific, merits attention.The attitude of the newly-formed Federation of Returned Soldiers towards peace and towards disloyal utterances is of interest.The comparisons between Commonwealth and United Kingdom taxation should be noted.South Africa.The seriousness of the attempts of the International Socialists to create dissatisfaction amongst the natives is shown by the Court proceedings, so far as they have gone. The desire of the Government to understand the native standpoint is indicated in the account of the meeting between General Botha and representatives of the natives. [p.to.
India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The observations of the Maharaja of Pali a. la on the proposal made in the Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms in favour of a Permanent Council of Princes are of particular interest and importance. It will be remembered that last year the representative of the ruling Princes the Maharaja of Rikaner threw out the suggestion for a Permanent Council of Princes.The Press telegram about the reception of the Constitutional Proposals in India is of interest.Attention is directed to the resolution containing the proposals of the Government of India about popular control in local bodies.The example of Punjab loyalty given in this Report is in satisfactory contrast to the statement occurring in last \veek&apos;s Report.G.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Validity of Cancelled Exemptions : Important Habeas Corpus Cafe. The gravity of the issue involved in the judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal, which declared that the Order-iu-Council of April 20th, cancelling the exemptions of men of 20 to 22, was invalid, on the ground that the Governor in Council is not empowered by the War Measures Act, 1014, to amend the Military Service law, which is an Act of Parliament, has been realised by the Government, and the Ministry of Justice applied for a stay of all future judicial proceedings locally, pending the hearing and determination by the Supreme Court of Canada. The statement read in Court on behalf of the Minister, of Justice stated that &quot; any disadvantage which may ensue either in respect to the Court or the individual by such a suspension of judicial proceedings is vastly outweightecl by the irretrievable consequences which threaten the Commonwealth, if in this time of crisis necessary military operations are impeded for the execution of an order, which within so short a time may not impossibly be reversed.&quot; The statement further says the Government is advised that the judges who have held against the validity of these measures have failed to interpret the intention of Parliament, and have in consequence denied the power which is essential to national safety.A new phase in the situation created by the Alberta habeas corpus decision which affected the validity of the Order-in-Council of April 20th developed when the military authorities produced an Order-in-Council passed in Ottawa on July 4th,. practically rendering such judgments ineffective. This Order declares that the &quot; Governor-General in Council on the recommendation of the Acting Prime Minister, is pleased to order that the men whose exemptions were cancelled jmrsuant to the provisions of the Order-in-Council of April. 2.0th be dealt with in all respects as provided by the said Order-in-council, notwithstanding amv judgment or any-order that may be made by any Court, and that instructions be sent accordingly to the General and other Officers Commanding military districts in Canada.&quot; When this Order was read in Court, Chief Justice Harvey observed that it apparently superseded civil law in the country.The Minister of -Justice subsecpiently stated on July 15th :  &quot; The Government cannot act in Alberta differently from elsewhere, and are in general agreement thai if writs were issued on behalf of ail men affected, by the Order-in-Council of April 20th, the general operation of the Act would be paralysed. The Supreme Court of Canada will hear on Thursday next all questions raised by the Alberta habeas corpus judgment. A cessation of the military movement would be disastrous.&quot;- With a full realisation of ail that is involved, the statement proceeds, toe Government recogmW that it is their high and imperative duty to see that the reinforcements now arranged for are sent without fail and without delay.The question of the validity of the Order-in-Council of April 20th will be considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in the form of an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the case of Private George Edwin Grey, of Nipissing, who is under arrest for refusing to put on uniform at Niagara, or to be inoculated. Grey is a farmer who was refused exemption by the local tribunal, but he secured it from the appeal tribunal at Haiieybury so -long as he remained a farmer. Prom this decision the military authorities appealed to the Central Appeal Judge, and the application was before Mr. Justice Dull when the Order-in-Council was passed.The action of the Government in the above matter has been publicly criticised by Mr. Roclolphe Lemieux, who is one of Sir Wilfrid Laurier&apos;s supporters on the
Opposition side .of the House. Mr. Lemieux is reported to have said:-&quot;I do not want to discuss for the present the climax reached by the military and civil-authorities regarding the writs of habeas corpus, but I will state that this comes under one of manj^ warnings given by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to the Government every time it wanted to go beyond its powers. We are now living in a period of political anarchy. While great problems need to be settled at home, while during a war a country needs its leaders, Canada sees its Ministers travelling from place to place instead of remaining at home to look after its destinies.&quot;Railway Labour Difficulties. The Government is keeping in close touch with the threatened trouble on the Canadian railways, and is awaiting the outcome of the conferences now proceeding between the Railway War Board and the shopmen.It is intimated by both sides that every possible effort will be made to effect an amicable settlement, and thus prevent a-tie-up of the transportation s3Tstem through-out the Dominion, as a strike of the workers involved in these negotiations would in all probability be followed by a strike among other classes of railway employees.The emergency meeting of the Canadian Railway War Board, ended with the despatch of a letter to the representatives of the federated trades, stating that the Board would not go beyond the McAdoo schedule, which has already been rejected by the men. This means that unless one of the sides recedes 50,000 railway men will strike. According to the Board&apos;s letter the granting of the men&apos;s demands would, involve &quot; either early bankruptcy for every road in Canada, including the Canadian Pacific Railway, or the imposition of freight rates so high that Canadian industry would be absolutely barred any share in export business, while the cost of living and manufacture would reach ruinous figures.&quot; As to the attitude of the Railway and Federated Trades Representatives the Railway Board state : &quot;As the Board offered your Committee representing Canadian shopmen, who constitute 10 per cent, of your international organisation, the same rate of wages and hours as now apply or may apply as a result of the negotiations at Washington to 90 per cent, of your organisation on the United States Railways, the Board feels you have no moral right to countenance or order a strike, and believes you should accept its offer, which is the extreme limit to which it can go.&quot; Press reports indicate that after a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Railway Shopmen on July 16th, no strike order was sent out.Enlistments during June. Enlistments in the Canadian Army during the month of June totalled 19,333, according to a statement just issued by the authorities at Ottawa.Although No. 12 District Headquarters, which is at Regina, led in the number of recruits enrolled at any individual district, Ontario again headed the list of Provinces with G,2s5 men signed on during the month, while Quebec was second with a total of 3,127.-   AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Ministerial Representative in London. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) made the following statement on July 12th : &quot; 1 notice that some newspapers have again been discussing rumours that the Prime Minister is likely to remain in Great Britain, either as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet, or as the representative of the Commonwealth Government. On resuming work, I take the first opportunity of -deprecating such gossip. None of us can say how lone: the Dominion Ministers may be asked by the Imperial authorities to stay in the Mother Country, but I can state definitely that as soon as their work in Conference and Cabinet is finished, it is the intention of Messrs. Hughes and Cook to return to Australia. Whilst they are there they will consider whether it is advisable or necessary for a Commonwealth Minister to go to London to take charge of the extensive administrative duties and expenditure associated with our oversea activities, but to couple the name of the Prime Minister with such an appointment, if made, is not fair to him, and is misleading to the public.&quot;Commonwealth Press on Representative in London and Political Situation. The Melbourne Age of July 10th stated that great uncertainty prevails in the Federal political area as to whether Mr. Plughes will return, and asserts that the Coalition Party is becoming restive, and the feeling is steadily growing that Mr. Hughes is not
likely to come back to participate in fresh political turmoil. The Argus, commenting on the political situation later, said that if the Federal Cabinet decides to be repre-sented by a Senior Minister resident in London, Senator Pearce should be selected. It points out that in London administration relates almost exclusively to military . matters. There is no foundation for the rumours that Mr. Hughes will not return to-Australia. The members of the Nationalist Party, the Argus goes on to say, are quite satisfied that the movements of Mr. Hughes are governed entirely by public interests. Neither inside the Cabinet nor outside is there the slightest appearance^ of restiveness. The tone of the party as a whole is much too serious to permit the-intrusion of a peculiarly graceless and petty spirit, which would seek to make-political capital out of the absence of the Prime Minister upon a mission of grave-moment.Allied Interests in the Pacific. A representative meeting held in Sydney Town Hall has decided to form &quot; Hands Around the Pacific Club,&quot; with a view to cementing British, French, American and other Allied interests internationally, socially, and commercially.Returned Soldiers and Victorious Peace. The Returned Soldiers&apos; National Parties. J of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland have formed a federation, and have passed a resolution to do all that is possible to secure a victorious Allied peace.   The federation has also expressed the opinion that persons convicted of disloyalty should be disfranchised for life.Construction of Steel Vessels. The Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr. Poynton) has announced that arrangements have been completed for the construction of four steel vessels of 5,500 tons by Walkers, Ltd., of Queensland.; also four hj Poole and Steele, Ltd., of South Australia.Lord Forrest coming to London. Lord and Lady Forrest leave West Australia towards the end of the month for London. Lord Forrest intends to take his seat in the House of Lords as soon as practicable.Commonwealth Taxation compared to United Kingdom. The ivcting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), replying to criticism regarding the burden of taxation, said the combined expenditure of the Commonwealth and States in 1913-14 was 63,077,291Z,, and in 1917-18, 168,986,335/-. Approximate comparison between the taxation of Australia as a whole and of the United Kingdom for the same years a;ave the following figures -Commonwealth and States, 1913-14, 22,892,742Z. ; 1917-18, 33,264,4707,, an increase of 10,371,728Z. ; United Kingdom, 1913-14, 163,035,000Z.1917-18, 613,040,000Z., increase of 450,005,000Z. Per capita figures show : Commonwealth and States, 1913-14, 4Z. 14s. ; 1917-18, 6Z. 15s. 3d.; United Kingdom, 1913-14, 3Z. 11s. 4cZ. ; 1917-18, 13Z. 6s. Qd. The public debt per head for the Commonwealth and States in 1913-14 was 69Z. 13s. Od , and for 1917-18, 123Z. 9s. 10cZ., an increase of 531. 16s. 5cZ. per head. For the United Kingdom, 1913-14, the amount was 14.1. 5s. 10cZ., and for 1917-18, 127Z.&apos; 3s. 5cZ. per head, an increase of 1I2Z. 17s. 7cZ.SOUTH AFRICA.Arrested International Socialists. The charge against the three International Socialists who have been arrested by order of the Union Government (vide Report No. 76) is that of public&apos; violence. The Public Prosecutor, asking for a remand for a week, said that there w7ere a number of cases and a mass of papers to be gone through. He opposed bail, saying that the allegations were of a very serious nature. He alleged that the accused had sat in council with natives, and the result was the strikes among the municipal natives and among certain mine natives, and also the creation of general dissatisfaction among.the natives. &quot; It was,&quot; he added, &quot; only through an accident that a quarter of a million natives had not struck in the Union.&quot; The Public Prosecutor-further alleged that the propaganda preached by the accused was&apos;disseminated throughout the Union with such disastrous consequences that the authorities had been obliged to take immediate action.
The accuseds&apos; advocate repudiated the Public ProsecutoFs statement.The High Court refused.,the application for bail. The Judge commented upon the gravity of the charge of inciting the natives and the serious responsibility falling-upon people alleged to have been tampering with the natives.Native Strikers. The ringleaders of the native employees who struck on Julv 2nd on the Crown Mines and the Ferreira Deep properties have been sentenced to three months&apos; hard labour,&apos; the execution of the sentences being suspended on condition of the men being of good behaviour.At a meeting of the Interdenominational Native Ministers&apos; Association, which claims to represent thousands of natives of the Transvaal, a resolution was passed expressing the greatest appreciation of the reduction of the sentences passed on the Johannesburg municipal strikers. The Association welcomed the appointment of a Commission of Enquiry. The resolution added that though the members of the Association differed from the natives in their idea as to the means for gaining their end, they nevertheless agreed that the natives&apos; demands were modest in view of the higher cost of living.Prime Minister and Natives. A Reuter message from Pretoria states that the Prime Minister (General Botha) met on July 11th a thoroughly representative gathering of natives, comprising delegates not only of tribes throughout South Africa, but also of various - sections of the native community following different occupations. Twenty members of the deputation voiced the grievances which have been in question and which are largely &quot;economic for example, the increased cost of living, the disabilities of the colour bar, and the compensation provided in respect of miners&apos; phthisis, death, and disablement. Others are concerned with the lack of educational facilities, and with the operation of the laws relating to native passes. General Botha expressed his readiness to investigate fully all the representations made on receipt of the report of the Commissioner, Mr. Moffat, Chief Magistrate of the Transkei territory, regarding the recent strike. General Botha pointed out that the increased cost of living had affected all classes in all parts of the world, and was necessitating frugality and economy. He also emphasised the difficulties in the way of remedying the grievances of the natives by means of legislation. Finally, he counselled them against agitators, whose efforts, he declared, were not directed towards promoting the interests either of the natives or of the general public.Ederiburg Bye-Election. Mr. F. W. Beyers, K.C. (Nationalist), has been returned unopposed as member of the House ot Assembly in succession to Mr. Everard Fichardt.   There is thus no change in the political representation of the seat.Gold Profits Tax. The Transvaal Provincial Council has passed the gold profits tax which, it is estimated, will bring in 217,000L annually.Press Mission. A South African Press Mission is proceeding to the United Kingdom and thence to the Western Front at the invitation of the Ministry of Infor-mation. The Mission consists of the following Editors : -Mr. R. Ward Jackson of the Rand Daily Mail; Mr. G. A. L. Green of the Cape Argus ; Mr. Pollock of the Natal Advertiser; Doctor Eugelenburg of the Pretoria Volkstem; and Mr. Mackenzie of the Bloem.fonbe.in Friend. The Editors of the Cape Times, Onsla?id, and De Burgher are unable to accept the invitation.ISDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Constitutional Reforms : Council of Princes. His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala, in the course of a public statement last week, referred to the recent &quot; Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms &quot; (vide Report Ho. 7G) and to the proposal for a -permanent Council of Princes. - He said : &quot; I and my brother Princes wish to contribute our share to the development of the Empire and to the development of India.   We have no wish to interfere in the6073-3.1 B
affairs of British India, and we profoundly cherish the treaties and engagements which leave us independent in regard to the internal administration of our States. The Report fully acknowledges this cardinal fact, but at the same time it takes account of the necessity for providing for.increasing co-operation between the Ruling-Princes and the Government of India in questions where British India and the Indian States are jointly concerned. I have no doubt that I am expressing the opinion of my brother Princes when I say that I welcome whole-heartedly the proposals which the Report, makes to ensure that in such questions the views of the Princes should be presented to the Government by an authoritative body speaking on their behalf. We look forward to taking our place in the organic development of the British Empire, and if we are to do this, satisfactorily provision must exist for taking our views into account in matters affecting the relations of India as a whole with foreign States, and in such questions as defence, currency, and Customs.&quot;Constitutional Reforms: Reception in India. A Renter telegram from Simla dated July 8th states: &quot;The reception of Lord ChelmsfonPs and Mr. Montagns reform scheme is upon the whole favourable. Officials are generally prepared to accept tlm proposals loyally as those of their chiefs, and even where, as in mam-cases,, tlmy are doubtful of their smooth working, they recognise them to be an honest endeavour to meet an admitted political necessity for the extension of democratic institutions.&quot; The non-official European attitude is more distinctly critical, and is inclined to dispute both the timeliness and expediency of the proposals, but is nevertheless prepared to accord them a fair hearing. The general opinion prevailing in well-informed Indian circles, while regretting the slowness of the progress proposed, generally endorses the scheme as a first instalment. Mr. Surendranath Banerjee and other Moderates have already issued a circular deprecating condemnation of the scheme before an examination of its merits from the puint of view of practical politics.&quot; The opinion of the Home Rulers is divided, Mrs. Besant and other leaders being bitterly attacked by their own followers for having given alleged secret pledges to support the scheme.&apos;&apos; The more responsible sections of all parties appreciate the conciliatory spirit of conscientious thoroughness and scholarly care in which a difficult problem has been approached, and also the lucidity and competence of the drafting of the pixposals. The principal points which have been criticised concerned the proposed divided authority in provincial administrations, and also the complication of a bi-caineral legislature in India.&quot;Popular Control in Local Government. The Resolution containing the proposals of the Government of India relating to popular control in local bodies and independence for them of outside control, has been issued in India, After pointing out that &quot; the control of Government over local bodies is at present exercised both from within and without,&quot; the Resolution observes that &quot;it is mainly by the substitution of outside for inside control and by the reduction of outside control, so far as is compatible with safety, that progress will be achieved.&quot; At present rather more than half the members of municipal and rather less than half&apos; of those of rural boards, including in this term sub-district boards, are elected.. Substantial elected majorities are now to be conceded in boards of both kinds,&apos; and the system of nomination is to be retained only in order to secure the necessary representation of minorities and the piresence of a few officials as expert advisers-without a vote. Generally the proportion of nominated members is not to exceed one-fourth, apart from the nomination of men possessed of official experience for purposes of advice and discussion only and without the right of voting.The principle is laid down that the franchise should be sufficiently low &quot; to obtain constituencies which will be really representative of the body of the ratepayers.&quot; At present the average electorate in - municipalities represents only some G per cent, of the population, and the electorate in district boards only some 0&apos;6 per cent.Provincial Governments are asked to make every effort to give local bodies a. free hand with their Budgets, subject to the maintenance of a minimum^ standing-balance, with the necessary reservation in the case of indebtedness or against gross default, The Government of India would discard the system of requiring local bodies to devote fixed portions of their revenues to particular objects of expenditure, and
would rely on,obtaining powers of intervention from outside in cases of grave neglect or disregard.The resolution also deals with the development of the panehayat system in villages. It is recognised that the prospect of successfully developing pancliayats must depend very largely on local conditions, and that the functions and powers to be allotted to them must vary accordingly.It is believed that a large -part of the suggestions of the Resolution can be brought into effect without any change in the existing legislation, and so far as this can be done action should be taken without further delay. The Resolution concludes &quot; It is on the increased experience to be gained in the administration of local civic affairs that the country must to a large degree rely for the expansion of its self-dependence in the sphere of central government.&quot;.Punjab Loyalty. A gratifying exarhple of Punjab loyalty to the British Empire is afforded by the zemindars of the Lyallpur district, who have spontaneously offered a gift of a twenty-fifth of the entire wheat crop, estimated to be worth 140,000Z., to the Imperial Government for the expenses of the war. The Government have expressed their cordial appreciation and have asked the people to invest the money in the war loan, the interest to be used for village purposes, including assistance to soldiers&apos; families.FOREIGN COLONIES.-   GERMANY AND AFRICA.Dr. Solf on Germany^ Colonial War-aims. Dr. Solf, the German Colonial Secretary, has contributed an article to the current number of the Leipzig Illustrierte Zeitung on Germ any&apos;s colonial future, in which he reiterates his firm conviction that &quot; Germany^ colonial war-aim, owing to its national importance, is not surpassed by any other war-aim.&quot; Regarding the &quot;economic side of the question, he says, &quot;the blockade of raw materials-announced against us by the Entente relates exclusively to such raw materials as are produced in tropical climates. Even if we succeeded in con Averting by the final Peace Treaty the announced blockade of raw materials into a supply of raw materials, without, however, ourselves having the possibility of producing on our own ground a portion of the most necessary colonial raw materials, we should still, in an unbearable manner, continue to depend on the goodwill of foreign Powers. The open door and free overseas commerce would not alone suffice. We do not contemplate closing our Colonial Empire to foreign trade. Those who earnestly advocate a lasting world peace must recognise that such an aim would remain Utopian as long as Germany remains excluded from her own colonial possessions. The British know very well that we need not fear any comparison with other colonising States, even including Great Britain herself. Our capacity in the Ivultur-political domain entitles us to a share in the work of colonisation which is the duty of the higher civilised races. Germany&apos;s future position as a world Power is closely bound up with her colonial future.&quot; Dr. Solf, in conclusion, defends his well-known plans for the redistribution of colonial Africa, and adds:-&quot; Such equilibrium in the colonial domain will, together with the removal of future possibilities of conflict, be one of the best guarantees for a lasting world peace.&quot;
