SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No, 81,PART I.-BRITISH- EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The Interim Report upon Registration, in the Dominion is of considerable interest. It is to be noted that, in the Eastern Provinces, males are outnumbered by the opposite sex, while in the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia the contrary is the case.The Prime Ministers observations on railways in relation to the State indicate a broad polic\^ of co-ordinating the administration of ah the lines operated by the Government.Dr. Belaud, who was Postmaster-General in Sir W. LanrieFs administration, is apparently devoting all his energies towards bringing the extremists in Quebec Province into harmony with the exponents of a vigorous war policy. It is to be remembered that the French Nationalists under Mr. Bourassa were practically ouly associated with the followers of Sir Wilfrid Laurier in their common opposition to conscription, and the French Nationalist extremists are quite ready to cause embarrassment to the. Liberals in their support of the war. Dr. BelaucPs campaign may therefore prove of importance.The paragraphs relating to steel shipbuilding as a permanent industry and to the increased business activitiesan the country should receive attention.Australian Commonwealth.The.importance of the message to the United States arises from the reference to the future of the Pacific. It is no doubt the policy of the present. Government of Australia to look to the great Republic for co-operation in the future defence of Pacific Seas. In this connection the remarks of Sir Joseph Ward appearing in the Appendix of last week&apos;s Report mav^ be usefully consulted, as showing the point of view of a prominent statesman of New Zealand.The significance of the introduction of the Sedition Bill into the New South Wales Parliament arises not only from the fact that the Premier has thought well to take this strong measure, but also because the Division on the First Reading of the Bill was a very close one, and apparently entirely on party lines.The importance of the paragraph relating to the attitude of certain pacifists in the Commonwealth Parliament in regard to German Colonies should not be exaggerated, as those adopting the extreme pacifist view are in a small minority in Parliament.[p.t.o.
Foreign Colonies.The pronouncements in Germany as to the necessity of retaining the Colonies for the supply of raw materials, and as naval bases, are part of the organised cam-paign for educating the people on the need of Colonies. The arguments used are well worth noting, especiailv from the point of view of propaganda in this country.H. d&apos;E.September 5th, 1918.As far as the Press messages indicate it appears that the Federal Members of the Official. Labour Party in New South Wales are dissociating themselves from the recent decision of the Inter-State Labour Conference to take a referendum of the Unions on pacifist lines.   This involves a further split.South Africa.The Ministerial statement as to the capital in tire country and the steps to be taken for its organisation affords gratifying evidence of the financial stability of the Union. -The Nationalist criticism of Imperial, relations continues to be on familiar lines.The observations of the Governor-General upon the campaigns in German East and South-West Africa come as a timely reminder of the achievements of the Union in these spheres of war.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The efforts of the Extremists to induce the Moderates to take part in the National Congress have proved unavailing. It is interesting to observe that the &quot; Servants of India &quot; Society have decided to take part in the Moderate Conference instead of the National Congress.

PART   I. -BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Registration Results.-The interim report of the Canada Registration Board -shows a total registration of considerably more than 5,000,000 persons of over 16 years of age.The following table shows the registration by Provinces : Nova Scotia   - - -            -             - 308,589New Brunswick     ,    ... - - -         -         - 222,988P.E.I.            - - -            -            - 53,689Quebec            - - -         -         -         - 1,227,424Ontario         - -          - -          - 1,863,742-Manitoba       - - -            -            - 317,447Saskatchewan    - - -          -         &apos;- 417,534   .-Alberta          - - .-    &apos;       -            - 317,402British Columbia - -          -   -     -          - 315,219Males registered number 2,572,754 against .-2,471,280 females. In the Eastern Provinces of the Dominion the females outnumber the males by a considerable margin, but they are in a minority of over 175,000 in the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia.The report, which is made by Senator Gideon Robertson/ Chairman of the Regis-tration Board, states that the work has been carried out smoothly except among some of the foreign population and in certain disaffected sections of the Province of Quebec, where registration was regarded as the precursor of something more drastic. Men-nonites in the West at first refrained&apos; from complying with the law for fear of surrendering their rights, but finally were induced to obey. &apos;     -The registration showed that several hundred thousand persons are trained in agriculture but engaged in other occupations at the present time, and the report says that in a situation of extremity production could, be immeasurably increased by the employment of this abundant source of labour. In Ontario and Manitoba alone the number of men placed in this category is stated to be 140,000.Dominion&apos; Railway Policy.-The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) has announced the general scope of the Governments railway policy. According- to a Press cable he declared that &quot; the country had embarked upon a wide policy of State ownership under very favourable conditions,&quot; and said that the 14,000 miles of rail way owned by Canada should be operated as one s^^stem under one management, and connected as soon as possible with steamship lines on both the Atlantic and -the Pacific. This operation, he stated, should be absolutely free from political influences, and the system should not be administered by a Department of the Government. For these reasons and for this purpose, he declared, the Board of the Canadian Northern system would be reconstructed in the immediate future. With one. exception, he said, &quot;the largest railway proprietor in Canada is the Canadian people. The time may come when there will be no exception.&quot;Dr. Beland and Quebec Extremists. Dr. Henri Belancl, who formerly occupied the position of Postmaster-General in Sir AVilfrid LaurieFs Administration, and who has recently been released from captivity in Germany, has been delivering some important addresses in Quebec Province. In the course of these he urged the people of Quebec to become a greater moral force in the war, and to make an end to all extreme sentiment and expressions oh one side as well as the other, so that Canadians could work together harmoniously for the public good and towards the victorious end of the war. Dr. Beland declared: &quot;Let us sacrifice at least some portion of our extreme opinion and act more on the common ground.&quot;    y
Losses.in Overseas Forces. Up to August 1st last, the net losses in the Overseas Military Forces of Canada in England and in France was 115,806 officers, nom-commissioned officers and men. This number includes those killed in action or died of wounds, died, missing, prisoners of war, discharged as medically unfit, and discharged to take hp -other -lines of war work, and : also&apos; non-commissioned officers and men given commissions in the Imperial Army. It does not take into account officers and other ranks -wounded in action who have rejoined their units or are still fit for service overseas.]Shipbuilding as a Permanent Industry. The Dominion Minister of Naval Service (Mr. C. C. Ballantyne). in an interview at Montreal last week stated that he returned from overseas more than ever convinced that Canada had embarked on a wise policy in making steel shipbuilding a permanent industry. He declared that it was the intention to bring every possible pressure on shipbuilders in the Dominion who were, working on Government orders to secure completion of these contracts -with the utmost speed.Increased Business Activities. The increased business activities of the country are indicated by the Current Loans, which totalled at the end of July of this year nearly 906,000,000 dollars, representing an increase of nearly 8  million dollars, -as compared with the total on July 31st, 1917, and establishing a new record in the history of banking in Canada. The note circulation, on the other hand, showed a sharp decline of 6,000,000 dollars as against an increase of about 8,000,000 for -June. The deposits in the Central Gold Reserve stand at nearly 89,000,000 dollars, about 4,400,000 dollars having been added during July.Mineral Discovery in Saskatchewan. Details as to the discovery of the deposit of potash, sodium sulphate, and Epsom salts 30 miles north of Maple Creek (Sask.), show that the deposit was discovered on the driecl-up bed of an old lake, and that there will be no difficulty in extracting it. Professor McLaren, of Saskatchewan University, has examined the minerals and reported favourably.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.United States and the Pacific. The Governor-General has sent the following cable tojhe President of the United States : &quot; Australia proudly recalls the fact that 10 years ago the American Fleet visited these shores, officially proclaiming the friendship and the identity of interests of those two countries. While, like America, hating war, Australia nevertheless feels dntense gratification in bearing its portion of the burden to defend the rights and liberties of the world; and that Americans and Australians are to-day fighting side by side in the conflict which, it is hoped, will settle not only the fate of Europe but the future of the Pacific.&quot;Sedition in New South Wales. The Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holman), has moved in the State Parliament for leave to introduce a Sedition Bill which provides that any person subsequently convicted of any offences enumerated in the schedule shall be disqualified from being nominated as a candidate or for voting, or being elected as a member of Parliament, or of a municipal council, and that any member convicted would vacate his seat. The period of disqualification would extend from a minimum of four to a maximum of seven years. The Bill leaves the present definition of sedition unaltered. The Bill was.read a &apos;first time, after a division of 37 to 31. A Press cable states that the division was on Party lines, and that the Labour Party in the State are organising a campaign of protest against the discussed-franchisement proposals.Meeting of Parliament. The Federal Cabinet held a -lengthy sitting on August 30th in preparation for the resumption of the sittings of -Parliament on -September 18th.Pacifist Members on War Taxation and German Colonies. Reports are now to &quot;hand which-show, that when the Federal House of Representatives was considering, in the  last  session of  Parliament, the Bill for the raising of a further loan of -80,000,OOOL, Mr. Fenton (Victoria) moved -that no&apos; further flotations take place until
it was known &quot; what amount was obtainable for war purposes free of interest.&quot; &quot; The rich,&quot; he said&quot;, &quot; should be compelled to pay larger taxation than they were paying at present.&quot; The amendment was defeated. Mr. Brennan (Victoria) moved to have &quot;war purposes &quot; not to include the acquisition or retention by the Commonwealth of additional territory,&apos;this being in protest against what the mover termed the land-grabbing policy of the Prime Minister in regard to the German Colonies in the Pacific. This was rejected after the closure had been applied, and the Bill was then passed through Committee.Labour and no Annexations: Split in New South Wales. The recent decision of the Inter-State Labour Conference to take a referendum of the Unions as to whether Labour shall continue to participate in recruiting, oh condition that the Allies express their readiness to enter into peace negotiations on a basis of no annexations and no penal indemnities, has given rise to opposition from the New South Wales members of the Official Labour Party in the Commonwealth Parliament. A Press cable states that, with three exceptions, the latter have signed a manifesto urging the Unions not to vote on the lines suggested, and in effect pointing out that if official Labour refuses to support present recruiting efforts opportunity will be afforded for the introduction of conscription by the Government (vide also Report No. 70).Commonicealth Exports to Java. The Commonwealth Government have been informed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is disposed to favour the proposals put forward for the control of imports from Australia into Java, and that he has telegraphed to the British Consul-General at Batavia an outline of the proposed scheme (vide Report No. 83). It is suggested to the Commonwealth Government that they should now communicate direct with the Consul-General.SOUTH AFRICA.Capital in the Union. The Minister of Mines and Industries (Mr. F. S. Malan), at a meeting of the South African National Union last week said, according to a Renter message of September 2nd, that South Africa at present had a plethora of capital, but organisation is needed, and the Government had recently been negotiating with prominent financiers within the Union. The Minister forecasted an early announce-ment as to the arrangements which had been come to, and said they ought to go a long way towards establishing supreme confidence in the future of the country.Campaigns in German West and East Africa. The Governor-General (Lord Buxton) in opening the fete in connection with the Govemor-GeneraPs Fund, referred to the honours gained during the fighting in German South-West Africa and said : &quot; The campaigns in German West and East Africa have been less in the public eye than that of the Overseas Brigade, but those engaged have sho&quot;nn equal courage, endurance and success in the performance of their duty.&quot; It was true, he said, that there was not very much lighting, but that was because the campaign&apos;was so admirably planned and carried out that the enemy was always confronted by superior forces. - Not less than forty thousand combatants had been engaged in the campaign, as well, of course, as many thousands of others who were co-operating, and everyone of these men had clone their duty. This was the first campaign which the Union Government /had been called upon to undertake.Nationalists and Imperial War Cabinet. The Nationalist leader in the Caj)e Province (Dr. Malan, editor of De Burger) in a speech at Malmesbury last week, dealt at length with Imperial relations. He is reported in a Renter message to have complained &quot; of the&apos; Constitution being altered by the institution of an Imperial Cabinet,&quot; saying that thus the future of South Africa would be decided by a body on which the people of South Africa would be represented by men who had not been elected to it and who had no mandate.
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are decdt loith in the Eastern Report.)The Moderate Conference and the National Congress. Notwithstanding the efforts of the Extremist Party to induce the Moderates to take part in the fortheomiug National Congress at Bombay, the Moderates have remained firm in their intention to hold their own Conference.At a meeting of the Moderate Party in Bombay Sir Dinshaw Wacha was, according tc a Press cable, appointed Chairman of the recei^tion committee of the forthcoming Moderate Conference, and it was decided to ask Mr. Surendranath Banerjee to accept the presidency of the Conference. It is to be noted that according to a Press cable from Simla, Mr. Banerjee will move a resolution in the Imperial Legislative Council welcoming the Chelmsforcl-Montagu Report as constituting a definite advance towards the progressive realisation of responsible government, and proposing that the scheme should be referred to a. Committee, consisting of non-official members of the Council, who shall report upon it to the Viceroy.The &quot; Servants of India &quot; Society, which was founded by Mr. Gokkale, have decided not to take part in the National Congress, but to join in the Moderate Conference. The President (Mr. Srinivasa Sastri) in a lecture reported in the Press has stated that the Moderates considered that the Reform scheme required the support of weighty Indian opinion, and that it was not altogether safe but might yet encounter difficulties, and possibly be defeated either before or during its passage through Parliament. It would be far better, he said, to get the fullness of their reforms in 50 years if necessary by peaceful means, than to obtain in 20 years the same reforms, but after going through a terrible period of tribulation.Mrs. Besaut, writing in the Bombay Chronicle, reiterates her criticisms of the Reform scheme, but admits that the party for total rejectipn is in a minority.The National, Liberal League of Calcutta. The National Liberal League of Calcutta in a statement dealing with Constitutional Reforms, offers a variety of suggestions for the consideration of the Government, the chief being that there should be an equal number of European and Indian members on the VJceroy&apos;s Council; that there should be equality of pay and status as between members of the Executive Council and Ministers ; that the Police Department should be under an Indian member of the Executive Council; that only persons enjoying the confidence of the Legislative Council should be appointed Ministers ; that the Legislative Councils should have powrer to censure Ministers ; that the elected element in provincial Legislatures should be four-fifths; that there should be complete separation of judicial and executive functions ; that half of the superior posts in the Civil Service should be recruited in India ; and that the Government of India should have full power to regulate Indian tariffs.FOREIGN COLONIES.GERMAN COLON IPS.    .Supply of Raw Materials. An article in. the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (July 20th) states that &quot; Germany&apos;s requirements of raw materials from the colonies developed very quickly and to an extraordinary extent during the period of her great industrial advance.   The following table shows the increase in her imports of so-	189		1913.	Cotton	238	CO	628	3Palm-kernels and Copra	26	7	225	9Coffee          -	-      189	CO	219	6Rubber and Gutta-percha   -	34	8	137	0Rice	19	1	103	8Jute and Towr	24		94	0Cocoa Nibs	12	-1	67	1Sesame       -	5	&apos;5	43	7Cotton Seeds			at	-8Earth Nuts             -          -	9	-3	28	- 9	553	&apos;5	1,594	-4 t6-165- la
&quot;This table gives evidence of an import more than doubled and a dependence on foreign countries to an extent increasingly objectionable. How then will matters shape after the war ? With regard to cotton, which comes easily first in the table,: Continental Europe will have to reckon with conditions made far more difficult since the main productive districts have themselves made great progress in manufacturing ^during the war. American cotton will be largely manufactured in America and Indian cotton in India and Japan. The European cotton industry will have great difficulty in attaining its former dimensions owing to the diminished supplies Of raw materials and the restricted opportunities of sales abroad. In order to secure its future competitive ability, indeed even to meet the home demand quite apart from production for export, it will have to rely on obtaining cotton in its own dominions, i.e., on colonial cotton-growing, which may be supplemented by increased production in the Near East and Central Asia. Germany will be obliged to rely entirely on her own colonies for palm-kernels and copra which occupy the second place in the list. She will, indeed, do well to make every effort to increase production to such an extent .as to be in a positioii to import far more than the 226 millions worth of 1913, since by the increased import of vegetable fats from her own colonies she might be made independent of the large imports of animal fats which she drew from America before the war.&quot; Before the war Germany imported nearly all her rice from British colonies. In future there are possibilities of considerable quantities being grown in Africa, as well as in the Near East and Central Asia. Jute came entirely from India. Germany will not be able to avoid a position of dependence in this direction, but must look out for a substitute. Some of the Portuguese colonies sent Germany large quantities of cocoa, while earth nuts came largely from French West Africa, and sesame from China.&quot; The exclusion of Germany from her supplies of raw materials has had one effect unanticipated by her enemies, for the absolute necessity of colonial possessions has become recognised in Germany by classes hitherto indifferent to the question. Thousands of German workers are directly or indirectly dependent on the supplies of raw materials for the German market. This has been brought home to them by the abnormal economic conditions prevailing in Europe at the present time and by the GCOHOH11C AVcl r threatened by England, as is evident by the mass of literature on colonies which has recently appeared.&quot;Reasons for retaining German Colonies. In the course of speeches delivered in Germany during the month of August in support of the National Fund for dependants of those fighting in the German Colonies, it is reported that at a mass meeting in Berlin one of the official speakers, Captain von Wiese, said that Germany must insist upon the ratification of the &quot;Secret Treaty&quot; with England by which &quot; Portuguese Africa was to be divided between Germany and England.&quot; He continued: &quot;We must demand the extension of our colonies if a victory in the coming war of raw materials is to follow our military victory. We need colonies in the Pacific for military and strategic reasons ; we need naval bases. We must demand a German Africa stretching from the East to the South-West, for we&quot; need raw materials. And we shall put our demand through, for we have European pawns in our hand.&quot;Future of German Colonies. Captain Persius, in an article in the Berliner Tageblatt (August 30th), writes in a spirit of resigned pessimism regarding the future of the German colonies. He believes that even the Colonial .Secretary, Dr. Solf, has, of late, moderated his demands for increased German possessions in Africa, whilst he himself cherishes no hopes whatever of Iviao-Chau ever being restored to Germany, and expects, moreover, that Australian and New Zealand opposition will prove an insurmountable barrier to the return of Germany&apos;s possessions in the South. Seas and New Guinea. The only hope of Captain Persius seems to be that Great Britain may consent, on the conclusion of peace, to restore the German possessions in Africa, especially German East Africa, and that the Anglo-German agreement, which was ready for completion in August 1913, may eventually be signed. Finally, he insists that Germany requires- colonies&apos; from which to draw her supplies of raw materials, because she will be economically ruined if the ring of British world economy becomes an actuality.Militarisation of Natives.- The Kreuz Zeiiung comments as follows upon the British, assertion that Germany wants her colonies to use them as reservoirs of
auxiliary militar3r force:--&quot; It is a well-known fact that the Entente, especially France, has filled up her military forces from the military auxiliary sources represented by the black population, of Africa. If England now announces the publication of a Blue Book on German Colonial Policy, so Germany will reply to it by publication of the cruelties committed by Germany&apos;s enemies in the Colonies. The cruelties inlndia: and during the Boer War are known to all the world.&quot;Return of Colonies-and &quot; Self-Determinatioyi.&quot; At a meeting of the National Liberal Party at Rostock, Dr. Stresemann (President of the Party in the Reichstag) is reported by German Wireless&quot;to have said in the course of a speech on the poRtical situation : &quot; People in England demand of us the unconditional renunciation of Belgium, but we have never heard that they intend unconditionally to give iis back our celonies. On the other hand, Mr. Balfour quite recently has emphatically declined, to do so. Whether thereby he is giving play to English lust of annexation or any other kind of stealing of our possessions is beside the question. What hypocrisy belongs to the demand for self-determination of the peoples of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy wdiilst England at the same time declines every form of self-government to Egypt and India and to the Flemish people ! &quot;
