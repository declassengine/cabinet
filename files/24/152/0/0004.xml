SECRET.APPlfeoiATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 79.PART I.   BRITISH  EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The view that the Government cannot continue to call up men for military service, after the 100,000 required for reinforcements have been obtained, has necessitated the hearing of fresh habeas corpus applications.^The strike of postmen seems nearly at an end, except in the extreme West. It will be seen from this Report that the Government took drastic action to deal with the situation.The necessity to apply to the Conciliation Board before the declaration of a strike has been emphasised by an Order-in-Council.Australian Ooiijj on wealth.The observations of Mr. Hughes about the functions of the French Mission to Australia and French interests in the Pacific are interesting. Also the views of the Minister for the Navy on an Empire Fleet.The Acting Prime Minister has made an important statement about the rise in the War Debt and the need of borrowing 80,000,000Z. annually.The financial position and matters of industrial control have a close bearing upon the relationship of the Commonwealth and States, as shown in the account of the Treasurers&apos; Conference appearing in this Report.Other points of interest are those connected with the next War Loan, repatriation, and the technical training of returned soldiers.South Africa.The Ministerial campaign in the strongest Nationalist centres may have con-siderable effect at the present juncture. This forms a fitting prelude to the meeting of the South African Party Congress at Bloemfontein next month.The decision of the Johannesburg Town Council to retain unskilled white labour .at increased rates of pay may affect the Rand labour situation.The ideas of the writer of the article in the Kolnische Zeitung that South Africa provides the best opportunity for Germany to stir up feeling against England is
interesting. The extracts from this article given, under &quot;South Africa&quot; and also under &quot; German Colonies,&quot; are probably representative of the German view of the relationship between the nations of the British Commonwealth.India.(Exclud ing Extern al A ffairs.)The further Indian views on Constitutional Reforms should receive attention. The suggestion that an Indian Colony should be established in German East Africa is of interest.G. G. A.August 1st, 1918.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.Canada:Provision of Reinforcements: further Habeas Corpus Proceedings. Notwith-standing the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in favour of the validity of the Governments Order-in-Council cancelling exemptions from military service (vide Report No. 78), many-applications for writs of habeas&apos;corpus have been made. The ground of the applications now put forward is that the 100,000 recruits allowed to be drafted by Act of Parliament have already been obtained.Labour Troubles : Postmen&apos;s Strike. The male carriers who recently struck work in Toronto and other Ontario and Western cities have in the main returned to their duties, pending a thorough investigation of the wages question by a sub-committee of the Cabinet, and conditions are gradually becoming more normal, but postmen in Vancouver and Winnipeg remain obdurate on the advice of their representatives, and are still away from work. Drastic action on the part of the Government has been necessary, owing to what is regarded in official circles as the arbitrary and unreason-able attitude of the employees at Winnipeg and Vancouver, who have been joined by the men at Victoria, Regina, and several other smaller cities in the West. Following the refusal of the postmen to obey instructions and return to work immediately pending a conference between a committee of the Cabinet and repre-sentatives of the men, orders were issued to discharge those still on strike, and arrangements are being made to fill, the places of the strikers so that business may be restored to the normal at the earliest possible moment.Government Effort to prevent Strikes.-The Government have passed an Order-in-Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour in regard to the prosecution of employers who cause lock-outs, or employees who strike, without first applying for a Conciliation Board, and awaiting its award.The Order states that the provision of the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act of 1907 has been entirely ignored by one or other of the parties to a dispute in numerous cases, without the penalties of the Act being invoked, and the Minister is of opinion that the strict enforcement of the Statute would tend to prevent interruption of work and avert the evils caused thereby.Savings Banks Deposits.-Tlie savings bank deposits in the Dominion continue to show substantial gains. The June increases were upwards of $ 18,000,000, being the best report for any month from November last.These deposits now total $960,000,000, being within 8 12,000,000 of the highest ever recorded in the Dominions history, and $66,000,000 above the lowest level reached during the Victory Loan payment period.Passport regulations : necessity of uniform treatment. Lord Reading has. called the attention of the Foreign Office to the desirability of uniformity of treatment in issuing passports to women desiring to travel to England. lie points out- that of 120 women who recently went to England from New York, 4 were passed by the military control officers, 70 by the Canadian Government, and the remainder by other Dominion Governments. Lord-Reading suggests that while the present restrictions are necessary, the Dominions should adopt them, and that no women should be permitted to travel except under very extraordinary circumstances.
AUSTRALIAN - COMMONWEALTH.Australia anal an Imperial Navy. In connection with the launching of the Australian warship The Adelaide (which was laid down and constructed in the Commonwealth) on July 27thr the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Cook) sent a message to Australia, in the course of which, after reviewing the work of the Australian Navy in the war, he said : &quot;It will be seen that the Australian Navy, though very young, is not devoid of achievement, and that our naval history has actually begun. We have no desire to exaggerate the degree of help which we have been able to render in this mighty conflict, but it is important to notice that we have been able to help in a most effective way. The Australian Navy upon the outbreak of war was able to join up as part of a single British Fleet. This was due to the fact not only that the Royal Navy generously provided us with certain officers and men, but - also to the set principle that there should be uniformity in training officers and men, and in types and equipment of ships.   Ours is an Australian section of an Imperial Navy.&quot;France and the Pacific. Addressing the members of the French Mission to Australia [vide Report No. 78) last week, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) impressed on the delegation, whose mission, he said, was political, commercial, and military, that France, like Australia, had great interests in the Pacific. The two nations stood together in that. &quot; Let us be united in our policy,&quot; concluded Mr. Hughes, &quot;and say that we cannot permit any predatory Powers to build empires alongside our shores.&quot;TFar Finance : Commonwealth and States. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), referring to the, Treasurer&apos;s Conference, said its main object was to give to the State Treasurers a sketch of the financial position of the Commonwealth. He laid before them the difficulties facing the Federal Treasurer, and instanced the fall in the Customs Revenue, and the rise in the war debt. Australia must continue to borrow 80,000,000Z. annually while the war lasted, and also for a little time after the men had returned. The War Pensions Bill was increasing at the rate of 2,000,000Z. annually. A heavy addition to taxation was inevitable. During the war period, the Commonwealth has borrowed for new works and loans on behalf of all States excepting New South Wales. The other States felt that New South Wales having a free hand was anomalous and inequitable. He was hopeful that Mr. Holman&apos;s promise to give him the opportunity of addressing New South Wales Ministers on his next visit to Sydney would bear fruit. If so, the whole of the State&apos;s undertakings for the remainder of the war in relation to new money would be within the control of the Commonwealth. Another point was that of the redemption of loans. He informed the States it was scarcely possible for&apos; the Commonwealth to continue satisfactorily to give.its assistance and guardianship unless the conversion of loans were included in the arrangement.   The States promised early and sympathetic consideration.The Treasurers&apos; Conference subsequently considered the loan requirements of the States for 1919. The Commonwealth undertook to borrow 2,580,000Z. for allocation among five States, divided as follows : Victoria 600,000Z,, Queensland I,350,000Z., South Australia 230,000Z., West Australia 250,000Z., Tasmania, 150,000Z. New South Wales decided to adhere to the policy of borrowing independently of the Commonwealth, but the New South Wales Cabinet intend to discuss the question of entering the Commonwealth arrangement,Mr. Watt announced that the Taxation Commissioners had reported that they were unable to . frame a uniform return form for Federal and State purposes, owing to differences in the Acts. The Conference decided to recommend to their respective Governments to introduce a measure adopting the Commissioners&apos; Draft Bill.The Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holman) and the Treasurer of Queensland, (Mr. Theodore) were appointed a sub-committee to report upon the proposal to create one collecting authority for the direct taxes for the Commonwealth and the States.The Conference expressed the opinion that a commission representing the Commonwealth and the States should be appointed to report upon the existing duplication of service.Commonwealth and State Control of Industry. The Treasurers&apos; Conference to, which reference is made in the preceding paragraph, have under consideration a proposal delimiting the Federal and States spheres in the control of industry.
The&apos; sub-committee recommended the States to hand over to the Commonwealth the full control and regulation of (a) seamen and all labour employed on ships, excepting labour exclusively employed in harbours; (6) wharf labourers and coal lumpers ; (e) all employees engaged in shearing sheep and all labour in connection therewith; (cl) all employees engaged in the production of sugar; (e) all employees engaged in the coal-mining industry; (/) all employees engaged in mining and the &apos; treatment of metalliferous ores ; (g) all employees in the shipbuilding industry ; (k) journalists.  .The sub-committee also proposed that a judge of a State Arbitration Court might make an order referring any industry not- in the &quot;schedule to the Interstate Commission to decide whether it should be iucluded on either of the following grounds : (a) That the industry is&quot; materially affected by interstate competition ; or (b) that the industry is Federal in character.The State Courts were to retain their jurisdiction in regard to scheduled industries until the Federal Court assumed jurisdiction&quot; and made an award.A commission consisting of the President of the Federal Court&apos;and one judge from each State Court should meet once in three years or oftener to decide upon the standard living wage.Mr. Watt said the sub-committee&apos;s report withdrew a large area of industrial activity from Federal control and the proposal did not commend itself to him. After lengthy discussion Mr. Watt promised to confer with the Commonwealth Cabinet on the whole question and to indicate to the States what industries should be included in the exclusive power of the Commonwealth.Next War Loan. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has submitted to the Cabinet the proposed conditions governing the new War Loan, and the Cabinet have approved them.Work of Repatriation Department. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), speaking at a Repatriation Conference, said that the Repatriation Department since April 8th had dealt with 39,000 returned men with increasing success. During June employment had been found for 74 per cent, out of 5,000 who had applied. The Department would be able to place every man satisfactorily in the next three months, if nothing untoward happened to the industrial situation.Technical Training of Returned Men. Approval has been given in an interview between the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) and the Minister of Education for Victoria (Mr. Hutchinson), and an expert committee, to a scheme providing for the training of 2,000 returned men at technical schools throughout Victoria.Preference for Returned Service Men. The South Australian Parliament has been opened.&apos; In the Governors speech it was said that the Governments policy in making appointments was to give preference to returned soldiers and sailors.SOUTH AFRICA.Ministerial Campaign in Free State Province. Considerable attention is being devoted to the Congress of the South African Party in the Orange Free State Province, which opens at Bloemfontein on August 21st. The Congress will be preceded by a notable ministerial campaign in the Nationalist strongholds in which the Prime Minister (General Botha), the Minister of Lands (Colonel Mentz), the Minister of Mines and Education (Mr. Malan), the Minister of Agriculture (Mr. van Heerden), and the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs (Sir Meiring Beck), will take part. General Botha will address a series of meetings in the former rebel centres of the northern part of the Orange Free State Province, such as Heilbron, Lindley and Winburg. It is anticipated that the Ministers will deal principally with South Africa&apos;s relations to the Empire, and with Rejrablican propaganda.Unskilled Wrhite Liabour. The decision of the Johannesburg Town Council to retain unskilled white employees at enhanced&apos;wages has, according to Press cables, given rise to considerable discussion on this difficult aspect of the Rand labour problem.
JINDIA.(Excluding external affairs, which are dealt loith in the Eastern Report.)Constitutional Reforms : Futher Indian Opinion. It is officially reported that political interest in India has centred in the examination and discussion of the Report on Constitutional Reforms.The variety of views held in India upon the proposals is evidenced by cables appearing jn the Press. These indicate that the resolution of the Bengal Provincial Conference, declaring that the reform scheme does not present any real steps towards responsible government, is to be followed by a special meeting of the National Congress at Bombay wheat Mr. Tilak and Mrs. Besant will endeavour to commit the Congress to open hostility to anything but Home Rule.On the other hand, Mr. Surendranath Banerjee is endeavouring to counteract actions of the Extremists in several parts of India, and he states in his organ, the Bengalee, that a distinct and definite stage&apos; has been marked out towards the progressive realisation of responsible government.   At a meeting of   influential6073-5a BThe Johannesburg Star denounces the CouncLTs attitude as &quot; totally unsound economically,&quot; declares that the decision puts a premium on inefficiency, and urges that it is preposterous to deduce a claim of right from what was originally intended to be a temporary measure of municipal relief to indigent whites.On the other hand, the Johannesburg Daily Mail applauds the decision, pleading the necessity of &quot; systematically encouraging white men to do more of the work of the country,&quot; and objecting to &quot; the dictum that all unskilled work must be reserved for the Kaffir.&quot; The Cape Times, dealing with the broader aspects of the question, observes that if the Johannesburg Councibs precedent were followed throughout the Union, the practical result would be that, wherever public money was spent on unskilled labour, natives would be excluded,, since it is obvious that no public body would pay wages on the Council scale of over 10s. a day for black labour.The Ga.pe Times concludes : &quot; It cannot be to the interests either of white, brown, or black to have strikes and confusion on the Rand, or even to have a minority of the mines temporarily or permanently closed down. . But if these perils are to be averted the attempt to push exclusive white labour pretensions must be abandoned, and what there is to go round by way of meeting the increased cost of living must be shared among the whole labour force, and not on the principle that the whites must be served first or exclusively, or with the exaggerated liberality meted out by the Town Council to white employees.&quot;German view of the South African Situation. In the course of an important article entitled &quot; The Colonial Reckoning&quot; appearing in the Kolnische Zeitung of July 14th (see also under Foreign Colonies), the writer observes : &quot; In South Africa further sacrifices for the war would probably bring about a conflict between the two white races. Here also the English defeats on the Western front have had their effect. Speeches of a markedly hostile character have been made in the local Parliament. As a result Smuts, &quot;who has a keen political instinct, recently proposed a peace of understanding. However, a rearrangement of the conditions of power within the Union will change the attitude of the South African Government towards the occupied German territories, East Africa and South-West. We should, in the first place, direct our attention to this, for in the end we must regain from the South African Union the two territories, which form the best part of cur African Empire. The disagreement in South Africa, which has put a stop to the despatch of troops to the European front, again shows that the Union&apos;s interests are not in harmony with the war-aims of the mother country. ... If only we are in a position, by utilising any kind of political or military means, to exert a strong pressure on the colonies themselves, England must against her own will agree to surrender ours. In this connection the South African Union, which in other respects also is most clearly connected with our interests, would form the most suitable object. A successful thrust against Egypt would undoubtedly be the best method to over-throw the whole structure of artificial unity and community of interest between mother country and daughter States.&quot;
6sBengalis on July 13th, when Mr. Banerjee, Sir Krishna Gupta, Mr. B. C. Mitra and Sir Bajendra Nath Mookerjee were present, the Constitutional Reform Scheme was warmly welcomed.In dealing with the resolution of the Bengal Provincial Conference, the Times of India remarks that the local machinery of the National Congress, at least in Bengal, is entirely dominated by the Extremists. The journal adds, &quot;The probability is less that the pressure of agitation will succeed in compelling the Indian and Home Governments to produce a new scheme than that the status gvo will continue, and this will certainly be disadvantageous to India,.&quot;In the Punjab and Sind the influential newspapers are giving reasoned expositions of the merits of the scheme,Germany and India. The MheiniscJi Westfalische Zeitung. in an article entitled &quot;From Egypt to..India,&quot; states : &quot;. ... If Englancks war aims are the firm clamping together of all countries from Egypt to India, Germany&apos;s war aim is the liberation of Egypt threatened Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, and India.&quot;The Hamburger A7aehriehten has a leading article on similar lines, ending &quot; Our aim is victory over Great Britain, and in this main problem of the war is implied the liberation of India and Egypt, while the converse also holds good.&quot;Japan and India. The British Ambassador at Tokyo has forwarded to the Foreign Office a summary of a leading article in the Hochi, one of the principal dailies of Tokyo, dealing with the question of Japanese intervention in India. Under the heading &quot; All eyes should not be turned to the Western Front alone,&quot; the article refers to the fact that the Kaiser is casting longing eyes on India, and says that if the Germans actually invade India, by the terms of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Japan can hardly look quietly on. The climatic, transport, and other difficulties of an expedition to India are discussed, and the article chiefly regrets that by taking part against fellow&quot;-Asiatics, Japan will be placing obstacles in the way of its heaven-sent mission the harmonising of the civilisations of East and West. It points out, however, that it would be well if, by sending troops to India, Japan succeeded in shattering Germany and her militarism, but if this object failed owing to neglect to seize the psychological moment, it would be wasted labour. The article concludes :   &quot; That is why to-day is the most favourable opportunity for us to make our final decision. To confine the attention to the Western front to the neglect of ail else is hot the way to determine the ultimate issue. In particular Japan cannot afford to be neglectful in view of the situation in India and Siberia. At the present time, when the eyes of all are turned to the Western front, we feel it incumbent on us to urge people to reflect.&quot;An Indian Colony. A paper has been circulated to the members of the Imperial War Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India, entitled &quot;A Colony for India,&quot; the author being Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Theodore Morison, formerly a member of the Council of India, who has lately returned from occupying official positions in German East Africa, In the course of this paper it is pointed out that one of the urgent Imperial questions for settlement after the war will be that of the migration of Indians within the Commonwealth. The author agrees that the Dominions must reserve unquestioned their right to exclude what classes or races they like, but submits that India must receive compensation by having assigned to her a portion of the Empire in which she will occupy a privileged position, and he says that India would&apos; be glad to see assigned to her the territory of German East Africa. After reviewing certain facts regarding the country, and the possibility of its development by Indian agriculturists. Sir Theodore Morisou suggests that &quot; German East Africa is a country so vast, so suitable for Indian colonization, and potentially so rich, that India may be well content to accept it as compensation for her exclusion from the Dominions. But she cannot so accept it unless the statesmen of the Commonwealth assign to her a privileged position in that part of the world and recognise that it is India&apos;s possession, with whose administration they have no right to interfere. India must have freedom in directing the policy to be pursued in her colony ; she must have the right to control immigration, and, consequently, to exclude from her territory in East Africa immigrants from other parts of the Commonwealth.&quot;As to how Iudia would deal with these privileges, the author indicates that, having decided what areas are suitable to Indian immigrants, India would bring over
agriculturists and settle them on the hind iu the traditional Indian way; He continues : &quot; The younger sons of Raises and &quot;Zemindars would leave India with a hand of adventurous young men from their own neighbourhood, clear the African jungle and build villages, so that, as of old, a living part of India&apos;s social life would be transplanted and would develop in a new country. They woidd bring with them their village craftsmen, the carpenter to make their ploughs and carts, the weaver to weave their homespun clothes and the potter to turn their cottage utensils upon his wheel. These men, self-sufficient in their little village communities, would be genuine pioneers and colonists. ... As communications developed they would provide a large surplus of food for export overseas.&quot;As to administration, Sir Theodore Morison suggests that India could find the men for those technical departments for which the Colony stands in urgent need and that Indian medical colleges could supply the doctors. He suggests that no one familiar with modern India will dispute her ability to find the men for the executive and judicial services. The best of her deputy collectors and tahsildars would make excellent district officers. He also suggests that the military defence of the Colon3* should be put in Indian hands.Apart from the settlement of Indian grievances, it is suggested in the paper that the British Empire would gain two solid advantages from Indian connection with East Africa, viz., that the country would become a great food producing area, and that it would be effectively administered, each department of administration having an adequate staff.Finally, the author reviews the effect of the scheme upon the African native, and quotes the Bishop of Kilimanjaro, who was keenly interested in the progress of the African, who stated, &quot; L&apos;indigene apprenderait beaucoup plus facilement de ITndien que de 1&apos;Europeen parceque lTndien est son semblable.&quot;Dealing with the question as to whether a Government composed of Indians could work disinterestedly for the welfare of the natives, Sir Theodore Morison, in the course of his observations, argues that the public opinion of India would certainly insist that her policy should be generous to the African native.FOREIGN COLONIES.GERMAN  COLONIES.German View of Dominion Attitude. In the course of the article entitled &quot; The Colonial Reckoning &quot; appearing in the Kolnische Zeitung of July 14th, to which attention is called under &quot; South Africa,&quot; the following observations are made on the Dominion attitude towards the captured German Colonies : &quot; The Imperial Conference in London is transacting business and is not a mere social function. The Dominions want Germany&apos;s colonies in return for all their sacrifices, but the longer the war lasts the greater is the divergence between their war aims and those of thecmother country. This question has a great interest for Germany, who is firmly determined to demand back her colonies, for the answer to it shows her the path that she must follow. Euglancfs overseas possessions are no longer colonies in the old sense, but separate dominions, which, although they may join the mother country in a war against a common enemy, yet have widely divergent views as to the objects of the war. There are already signs of war weariness in Australasia. As a consequence of German victories in France, Australia and New Zealand have become anxious about their own future. They have fear of Japan, in comparison with which the possession of Samoa is a. small question. Besides, they do not see why they should continually offer fresh sacrifices to secure the war aims of the mother country.&quot;After referring to the compensation which England has found for her sacrifices by driving German trade from the high seas, the article continues : &quot; But the world-situation thus brought about, with Japan&apos;s commanding position in East Asia and the Pacific, would by no means suit the Australasian Dominions.&quot;
