SECRET,APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERAL&quot;   REPORT No. S3.PART I. - BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The comments appearing in the Dominion Press upon the recent decision to ensure the continuity of the work of the Imperial War Cabinet show a general appreciation of the importance of the steps taken, and at the same time a jealous regard for the autonomous rights of the Dominion Parliaments.* &quot; Canada. .The observations of Mr. Rowell upon the necessity of reinforcements have had the effect of bringing into strong relief the considerable number of deserters under the Military Service Act. The Government are taking vigorous measures to see that the law is enforced.It is of importance to observe that in the regulations just issued bv the Soldier Settlement Hoard, the Citizenship of the British Empire is an essential qualification for the enjovment of the rights and privileges under the recent Soldier Settlement Act. -The preparations for the second victory Loan should be noted.Australian Commonwealth.The decision of the Commonwealth Government to establish a Directorate of Educational War Propaganda is in pursuance of the announcement recently made by Mr. Watt as to the necessity of re-educating -the people as to the real meaning of the war. A useful precaution has been taken in regard to the possibility of aliens taking part in meetings or propaganda.An interesting regulation under the War Precautions Act will prevent the further display of Sinn Fein flags or other disloyal emblems during the war.The suggestion of the Commonwealth Government that practical measures should be taken to prevent the misuse of material imported into Java should be noted.The decision of the Government to take steps to develop the metallic possibilities of Australia is in accord with the general Commonwealth policj&quot; of taking all possible action to increase local resources, in both national and Imperial interests.r.p.t. o
South Africa.It is well that the Minister of Agriculture has called attention to the steadfastness with which the members of the South African Party in the Free State Province have recently supported General Botha under particularly trying conditions. The state-ment made by Colonel Mentz as to the people of South Africa having exercised their rights of self-determination at the National Convention is a completely effective answer to the recent Resolution of the Nationalist Conference. It is clear that as the Ministerial tour proceeded in the Free State Province the reception of Ministers materially improved, until finally Resolutions of confidence in the Government were carried.The farmers are apparently going to take the recent- ministerial hint, and will, consider in October whether unanimity can be reached in the matter of offering the wool clip to the Imperial Government.[ndia.(Excluding External Affairs.)The news from India tends in the direction of emphasising the cleavage between the Moderates and the Extremists. The decision to call the Conference of the Moderate Party has undoubtedly upset the calculations of the conveners of the special session of the Indian National Congress.Foreign Colonies.The passages in Dr. Sr.IPs recent speech which relate to colonial policy arc given in this Report. It is to be noted that the German Colonial Secretary^ previous claim to a redistribution of Africa on economic grounds gives place very largely to a. claim based on. moral grounds. The assertion that it is one of Germany&apos;s war aims to dispense with militarism in Africa is not supported by Dr. solf&apos;s previous statements..

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Dominion Press and Imperial War Cabinet. Various statements have apj)eared in the Dominion Press regarding the recent decisions involved in the Resolution accepted by the Imperial War Cabinet on July 3.0th, 1918 (vide Report No. SO). The Toronto Globe observes : &quot; Any new organ of government in the Empire, or any addition to its administrative or legislative machinery, shordd be very carefully scrutinised for possibilities of danger to local liberty, which is the corner-stone of Imperial unity. It will be the duty of the Canadian Parliament to review the work of the Imperial War Cabinet, and to have its place in the constitutional machinery of the Empire clearly-prescribed.&quot; The Ottawa Journal says: &quot;Consolidation, solidarity, and unity of aim and effort for self-preservation have come without the infringement of local self-government. That is an immense achievement, serving the common purpose, while not impairing the freedom of parts &quot; ; and the Montreal Gazette states that the functions of the Imperial War Cabinet &quot; are consultative, not executive ; that is to say, its decisions are not binding upon any of the Governments represented in its deliberations. The freedom of action of no Government is compromised or interfered with by its conclusions; each nation retains its perfect autonomy.&quot;- -The Montreal Star, in referring to &quot; the momentous changes in the Government machinery of the Empire,&quot; says : &quot; British statesmanship has cut ottt the middleman, so to speak, and by so doing has served the ends both of economy and efficiency in general. The new dignity accorded to the Dominions in their removal from under the wings of the Colonial Office in matters of communication is in keeping with their rise in prestige and in national consciousness in recent times.&quot;In South Africa the Gape Times says : &quot; The new departure is a long way short of an Imperial Commonwealth Parliament, but so far at all events as South Africa is concerned, this is only another way of saying that it is immediately practicable and wholly helpful, instead of being merely doctrinaire and liable to be turned to account by factions.&quot;The Nationalist organ, De Burger, declares that the step recently taken without previous consultation with the South African Parliament is a violation of the self-governing rights of the Union.1SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Canada and Navcd Defence. The Dominion Minister of Naval Service (Mr. C. C. Ballantyne) in the course of an interview recorded by the Montreal &quot;correspondent of the JDaily Telegraph (London) referred to plans for permanent Canadian participation in,an Imperial scheme of naval defence.   The Minister is reported to have said :  &quot; During my visit to England 1 have had many interviews with the Admiralty, which were necessarily of a secret nature. I can say that consideration-will be given by the Canadian Government to the question of naval defence for the Empire in the1 Cf., however, the statement of Mr. Van Heerden made in the course of the recent Free State Province Campaign that the South/african Parliament was supreme, and was not bound by the decisions of the Imperial War Cabinet.    ( Vide Report No. 82.)
very near future. The whole question will be considered on a future occasion, when, whatever expansion of Canada&apos;s present naval policy may be decided upon, it will be in harmony with the-wiews of the Admiralty, while, at the same time, Canada will preserve all her own autonomous rights in this regard.&quot;Quebec, Members and further Reinforcem,ents.-The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) has received a letter from Mr. Lucien Cannon and Captain C. G. Power, M.C., two Opposition M.P.s for Quebec constituencies, containing a reference to the calling up of additional-troops&apos;in Canada, which, they suggest, appeared to&quot; be indicated in the Ministers speech at Newcastle, Out., recently, when he said : &quot;I shall feel it nay hound en duty to the men and women who have fallen and who lie buried at the front to see that adequate reinforcements are provided to carry on the work for which they have given their lives.&quot;- Mr. Cannon and Captain Power quote this passage, and say in their letter that &quot; the words seem to presage a new levy of Canadians, for service at the front.&quot; They ask : &quot; Can the Government exact, a further sacrifice on our manhood ? To do so would be inopportune, useless and even ruinous, and in any case such a call could be made neither legally nor decently without the convocation of Parliament.&quot; In the course of his reply to this letter, Mr. Rowell says : &quot; I made no suggestion of a new levy. This would necessarily depend upon two considerations first, the extent of our casualties during the next few months ; and, second,&quot; the response of those liable to military service who have already been called upon but who have not so far reported.&quot;The President of the Council then refers to the magnitude of the casualties during the present month, and proceeds to point out that there are some 10,000 defaulters in the Province of Quebec alone.Finally, Mr. Rowell calls attention to a statement made by Mr. Cannon during the Dorchester by-election to the effect that Canada had done enough and should not send further help to England. This statement, said the Minister, was used by the German Press-&quot;to encourage the German people to believe that Canada is tired of the war, and is no longer willing to fight against Prussian militarism.&quot;May we express the hope,&quot; adds Mr. Rowell, &quot;that by your activity in now inducing all defaulters under the Military Service Act to obey the law and report for duty, you will undo, in some measure at least, the harm your speeches may have done to the cause of Canada and the Allies ? &quot;Deserters under Military Service Act : Government Policy. The Acting Minister of Militia (Mr, M. Burreil) issued a statement last week in which he referred to the decision of the Government to grant an amnesty to deserters until August 24th. After calling attention to the keen response to the call for an Expeditionary Force for Siberia, the Minister observed : &quot; There are thousands who have failed their-country in their country&apos;s need---men who having been notified to report for duty and refused to obey the law have thereby become criminals in the eyes of the law: ..... During the past two months nothing has given me greater anxiety than this condition -of affairs, and a continuation of it would be intolerable. I cannot too strongly empliasise the determination of the Government to carry out the terms of the Proclamation. A court-martial will be constituted in all military districts, and the law will be rigorously enforced and the extreme penalty imposed on all who fail to surrender.&quot;Regidatior^s for Soldier Settlers. The rights and privileges of settlers under the Soldier Settlement Act, 1917, and the method by which ex-soldiers and ex-sailors may obtain free entry to Dominion lands, are defined in regulations which have-just been issued by the Soldier Settlement Board. The term &quot; settler &quot; includes not only all those who have served in the naval and military forces of Canada and who have been honourably discharged, but also those who have taken part in active service as members of the forces of the United Kingdom or of the other self-governing-Dominions or of Colonies forming parts of the British Empire. British Empire -citizenship, active service, and honourable discharge are the three requisite qualifica-tions. Widows of men who have died on active service are also qualified to become settlers.
Preparations for Second Victory Loan : rise in BavT;, Deposits. Reports from Ottawa indicate that the general public seem to be preparing for the forthcoming-offensive now being planned by the National Committee in charge of the second Victory Loan. A striking evidence of this is found in the July bank statement just issued by the Treasury Department, the outstanding feature of which is a sharp growth in the savings bank deposits. These deposits at the end of last month stood at 1992,000,000, or within $16,000,000 of the highest mark ever reached in the country&apos;s history. The total deposits in Canadian banks now reach a figure slightly in excess of -$1,757,000,000, or almost -$193,000,000 over those at July 31st, 1917.Gold Coin and Bullion. Since the outbreak of. war gold coin and gold bullion to-the value of $1,300,000,000 have been received in the capital by the Department of Finance as trustees for the Imperial Government and the Bank of England.&apos;The heavy demand on the gold refinery at the Government Mint led to the construction of a second plant with a monthly output of 1,000,000 ounces of fine gold,, and through this extension the refinery has developed until it has now the largest-capacity of any gold refinery in the world.As the war made it impossible for the Newfoundland Government to get supplies-of coin from England, the coinage for that colony is now being manufactured at the-Canadian Mint.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Educational War Propaganda. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) states-that the Government have decided to accept a proposal recently made by a deputation (vide Report No. 81) to establish a Directorate of Educational War Propaganda.Aliens and Public Meetings. A War Precautions Proclamation has been issued&apos; empowering the competent military authority to prohibit any alien from addressing or taking part in meetings or propaganda.Display of Flags. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has announced that the Federal Cabinet have decided to draft regulations under the War Precautions. Act setting out the flags which may be displayed on buildings and in processions and demonstrations iu Australia during the war. These comprise the flags of the British Empire and Allies, and the Papal flag; for any other emblem permission must be obtained from the Minister of Defence.The Metropolitan Council of the Western Australian Labour Federation have decided by 67 votes to 15 against the proposal to fly the red flag Rom the Perth. Trades Hall.Coiumonwecdik Exports to Java. The Commonwealth Government have repre-sented to the British Government the desirability of setting up in Java an Advisory Committee, under the Chairmanship of the British Consul-General, in order to-prevent material imported from Australia into Java being stored there for post-war use by enemy countries, or being diverted to enemy countries, or being used by firms-with enemy sympathies in order to maintain their connection in Java during the war, &amp;c. If such an authority were established, it is suggested that orders for Australian material should be sent for approval to the Chairman of the Committee in the first instance and that the Commonwealth Government should not permit the-export of goods unless the orders arriving in Australia bore the stamp of the Chairman&apos;s approval. In this event the only criterion applying to approved orders would be whether the material could be spared in Australia.Metallic Resources of Australia. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has-announced that the Commonwealth Government have decided to purchase for 3,000L an option for 12 months over the property and rights of the Blythe River Iron Mines-Limited, Tasmania, with a view to developing the metallic resources of Australia and encouraging their most effective utilisation for national and Imperial benefit. If the-option is exercised the total sum payable is 110,000L The deposit resembles Cumberland Red Hematite, estimated to comprise from 1,700,000 to 23,000,000 tons-of marketable ore, suitable for producing the highest forms of iron and steel. Sir John Higgins, Honorary Metallurgical Adviser to the Commonwealth Government,.
was privately - offered tire property for flotation, bnt he gave the Commonwealth Government the first chance to secure the property. He has offered to assign his commission, totalling 10,000Z. to the Commonwealth Government for investment in inscribed stock, the interest to be devoted to the promotion of a study of technology of iron ores and metallic iron and steel in all forms.Owing to the shortage of foundry pig-iron and steel plates for shipbuilding and the smaller sections of steel bars, &amp;c;, the Acting Prime Minister has announced that no further permits to export iron or steel, from the Commonwealth will be permitted until local requirements are entirely satisfied.SOUTH AFRICA.Ministers in Free State Province. At a further meeting in the course of the Ministerial tour in the Free State Province (vide also Report No. 82), Renter messages report that the Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Van Heerden) eulogised the steadfastness of the members of the South African party in the Free State Province in circumstances of great difficulty. The Minister of Lands (Colonel Mentz) was loudly cheered on his declaring that the South African people at the National Convention decided on self-determination, not as striven for by Kruger, Rhodes, Hofmeyr or Escombe, but as the instrument by which the will of the people, Dutch and British alike, are reflected. General Botha, the speaker went on to say, wras standing for the rights of both sections, and for the rights of South Africa as part of the British Empire. They must carry on their responsibilities in war time just as they enjoyed the advantages of belonging to the British Empire in time of peace. If they Were proud of the work of General Smuts and Mr. Burton, who were maintaining the prestige and high honour of South Africa in England at present, he hoped they would openly declare in their favour and support them. The time had come for South Africa to be prepared not only for the German foe.but for everyone laying hands on the Constitution. The future held only two roads, one for the Constitutionalists and the other for the wreckers. If they wanted to help they must help to-day.The Minister of&quot; Mines (Mr. Malan) deeply regretted the absence of General Botha owing to ill-health. Referring to the tour, he emphasised the fact that the famous independence motion had not been moved at later meetings. He vigorously denounced Republican propaganda, and declared, amid loud cheers, that the statement that there was a deep-seated feeling among the people of South Africa for independence, as stated in the motion, was untrue. Mr. Malan finally proposed a Resolution upholding the Constitution, in view of the movement seeking &quot;to destroy one of its main principles. This Resolution and also others paying a tribute to General Botha and praying, for his early recovery and expressing confidence in the Government were unanimously adopted;The Ministerial campaign in the Orange Free State Province terminated at an enthusiastic mass meeting in Bloemfontein. It is reported that matters improved as the. tour progressed,. and that there was a notable demonstration at Thaba!Nchu, where a vote of confidence in the Government was carried by a considerable majority.The South African Wool Clip. The President of the South African Agri-cultural Union has summoned a conference of representatives of sheep farmers throughout South Africa to meet at Pretoria on October 16th. The hope is expressed that unanimity will be reached so that the Imperial Government ma)&quot; be induced again to negotiate for the purchase of this year&apos;s wool clip.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt until in the Eastern Report.)Political Situation. It is officially reported that there is no change in the Indian political situation.The Moderate Party and the National Congress. In connection with the decision of the Moderate Party to take no part in the forthcoming special session of the Indian National Congress (vide Report No. 82), the Reception Committee of the Congress have issued a circular which has been published in   the  Press   denying  that   the   special   session   is   being   organised   by   the
extremists. &quot;Dealing with the decision of the Moderates to hold an &quot; All-India&apos; Conference, the circular states : &quot;By convening this so-called All-India Conference of the Moderate Party to express acceptance and general support of the.Montagu-Chelmsford scheme, Sir Dinshaw Wacha cannot detract from the value of the special session of the Congress as representing the real voice of the country. The Indian National Congress is essentially and wholly democratic in constitution, and the leading spirits of the extreme section could not possibly hope to defeat or prevent a decision that is truly representative of the country. If Sir Dinshaw Wacha and his -friends consider that their views are calculated to serve the best interests of the country, it would be better for them to join the Congress and influence its decisions.&quot;A manifesto has been published by Bengal Moderates, including Mr. Surendranath Bauerjee, explaining their reasons for abstaining from the Congress. They maintain that there is a fundamental difference between the two schools of political thought, one recognising the limitations of the reform scheme, based on the Declaration of August 1917, and the sincerity of its authors, while the other school stands for the old Congress scheme and absolute distrust.FOREIGN  COLONIES.GERMAN COLONIES.Dr. Solf on Germany&apos;s Colonial Future. The German Wireless account of the speech of the Imperial Secretary of State for the Colonies (Dr. Solf) on August 20th contains some important passages relating to Colonial policy.As to the general question Dr. Solf said : &quot; The guaranteeing of our colonial future is not only the aim of our Government and of certain interested groups, but it has also become a national aim of the German people. There is to-day a lively consciousness spreading extensively among the working class, to the effect that the maintenance of our colonial possessions is a vital question of honour for Germany as a great Power and that our colonial war aim takes second place to no other war aim in national importance.&quot;Commenting on Mr. BalfouFs observations as to the danger of giving back the colonies to Germany in connection with the formation of great native armies in Central Africa, Dr. Solf said : &quot;Does not the English Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs know of the decimation of coloured peoples in various colonies of Africa by the procedure of&quot; the Entente ; does he know nothing of the compulsory levies in British East Africa, which were admitted in the House of Commons ; does he know nothing of the huge armies of workers and soldiers which have been brought from the English and French colonies? Has he enquired of his colleagues at the Colonial Office what it means to lead natives into war against natives ? Has he any idea of the immeasurable damage for the colonies and for all civilised nations which must arise from bringing black races to Europe and using them to fight against whites ? Does Mr. Balfour seriously doubt that the fate of the whole of Africa would have been better if England had not violated the Congo Treaty? Has he forgotten that Germany is the only belligerent Power which has expressly undertaken, as one of its war aims, the doing away with militarism in Africa ? &quot;Dr. Solf continued : &quot; We are not striving for any predominance or for an ascendancy ; we want a settlement among the States possessing colonies. We want a settlement of colonial questions on the principle that colonial possessions shall correspond to the economic forces of European nations, which, in a manner worthy of their history, shall protect the coloured races resident in them. Economic ability alone is not sufficient legal title to colonies. Those states which had &apos; endeavoured to act on this principle before the war, and which respected humanity even among coloured races, these nations have gained the moral right to be Colonial Powers.   This right Germany had gained before the war.&quot;
Commenting on Dr. solf&apos;s speech, the Norddeutsche of August 22nd said :  &quot; The fact is that the previous opposition in Germany to colonial activity has dropped during the war.   It is not an exaggeration to say&apos;that the very circles which opposed it (including the Social Democrats) advocate it now.   It is an absurdity to deny raw materials to a nation of Germany&apos;s strength and economic vitality.&quot;German Wireless of August 23rd also reports that the Norddeutsche recalls that, before the war, the question of progress in the German colonies had often been dealt with in expert English circles, and that leading British statesmen had often recognised Germany&apos;s absolute right to extended colonial activity, and that the Delagoa Treaty contained an admission in this direction.A writer in Germania of August 21st stated :-&quot; The speech was necessary in view of-the fact that Balfour is the first Minister who has clearly stated the intention of keeping the German colonies. Balfour fights against peace because any peace-possibility is against his plans. Solf fights for peace because we are waging a war of defence.&quot; .     -Referring to Lord Robert Cecibs reply to Dr. Solf, vorwarts declared as follows : &quot; We shall await with keen interest the British Blue Book on German Colonial administration, and shall be particularly interested to see whether there will be in it any mention of the fact that certain barbarities have been ruthlessly criticised in the Reichstag, more particularly by the Social Democrats, but also by the Centre and Progressives, that is to say, by the majority of the German Parliament, and that this criticism has not been without positive results. We fear that the Blue Book will not contain this, and that the German Government then will issue a White Book on British Colonial horrors, for which material already supplied by British Socialists and Liberals need only be collected. Such. a procedure, however, does not bring us a single step forward. JSTo sensible Englishman will expect Germany to recognise that she is beaten so long as she is not beaten.&apos;&apos;(See also &quot;Peace Discussions,&quot; Part II.)LIBERIA.Commercial Treaties. The Liberian Government are considering the amendment of Liberian commercial treaties with the object of eliminating enemy commercial encroachments after the war.
APPENDIX.   - -   -     &quot; : to &apos;Western and General Report No. 83.  Part I.THE PACIFIC PROBLEM.By the Rt. Hon. Sir Joseph Ward, Bart., K.C.M.G., M.P.(Minister of Finance, Dominion of New Zealand.)Introductory. There is no question which is of more importance to the Empire as a whole, and particularly to those nations of the Empire which have seaboards upon the Pacific Ocean, than the future of the Pacific in relation to other countries and to its adequate defence. The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean theatre in the world to-day, and it is not too much to say that history will show that there are probably no interests of an Lmperial nature anywhere that have been so much neglected as the interests of the Empire in the Pacific.Recent Developments. The Pacific Ocean is tending to become the chief ocean highway of the world, and this process has been greatly hastened by the completion of the Panama Canal. Firstly, it may be said that those who believe that the Panama Canal will not be accessible for the larger ships are labouring under a delusion. The able engineers of the United States are overcoming all the difficulties arising from land-slides in the Culebra- Cut and by the methods they are adopting will overcome any disabilities attaching , to ordinary navigation, and. will thus ensure that the deepest draught ships in the world may use the Canal. In short, the opening up of the Panama Canal and its availability for all shipping of whatever size, is a matter of the greatest importance and should be considered in. relation to the future -development of the Pacific. Indeed, this development will probably be far greater through the opening of the Panama Canal than that which ensued from the opening of the Suez Canal, and it is not necessary to emphasise that the Suez Canal, as the highway to the East, brought about a revolution in traffic arrangements. But the Panama Canal is much shorter (it is 51 miles in length) than the Suez Canal, and the effect of bringing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans within this distance of each other will make Pacific interests of still greater importance in the future than they have ever been in the past.The economic and political development of the nations, which necessitate fresh outlets for population and trade, emphasises the growing importance of the Pacific and makes the future mastery of that area one of the most important of international problems. In view of recent developments and of the improvements and facilities for the future utilisation of the Pacific by this and other countries, it is not too much to say that the problem of - the future is as to whether the white or the yellow races are to predominate in the Pacific.^Geographical Position. It is well to recall that the Pacific Ocean is bordered on the West by the Asiatic Continent and on the East by the American Continent. In the extreme North the two continents are separated only by the Bearing Strait, while thousands of islands are found towards the South, varying in size from small continents to isolated rocks. Practically all these islands are in the Western Pacific, and the ocean becomes almost deserted the nearer an approach is made to the American Continent. Thus, crossing the Pacific from either Australia or New Zealand and adopting the route via the Panama Canal, one finds an almost entire absence of islands of any kind when at a distance of about a thousand miles from New Zealand. As to the territories bordering on the Pacific Ocean, we find the Asiatic mainland China [and Russia; the American mainland Canada, the United States, and the South American Republic; the Western Pacific Islands Japan, Australia and New Zealand, and Dependencies in the Western Pacific which belong to those countries - and to other nations such as the British Empire, Holland and Erance.   Before the wrar, as everyone knows, Germany had certain possessions in the
Pacific which have been taken, over-by Japan, Australia and New Zealand, and are now being administered by those countries.Territories and Population. The distribution of territories in the Pacific in relation to the Allied and Neutral Powers roay be here mentioned. The United States, apart from its Pacific seaboard, possesses in the Pacific, the Hawaiian Islands, with the port of Honolulu, a part of the Samoan Islands, E. of 171 degrees W. longitude, with the magnificent naval and coaling station of Pagopago, ceded in 1872, occupied in 1898, and since fortified ; and the Philippine Islands, acquired as a result of the war with Spain. The American Pacific Coast presents a great contrast to the Asiatic Coast. The latter, studded with islands and archipelagoes, is very fertile and possesses huge rivers.&quot; The American Coast, on the other hand, facing the Pacific, is marked by mountain chains, and it possesses few harbours the only three of any importance in a coastdine of 1,500 miles being San Francisco, Columbia River, and Puget Sound. Further north, in British Columbia, there are several large and good harbours. California, Oregon, and Washington have a large trade in the Pacific, and the ports of Seattle, Portland, and Tacoma are growing rivals to those of Great Britain and Japan.Here it may be mentioned that the Butch founded their East Indian Colonies in the 16th century. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company was formed, which conquered and ruled these colonies for nearly two centuries. Since the dissolution of the Company in 1798, the colonies have been ruled from Holland. These colonies consist of Java and Madura, with the outposts of Sumatra, Borneo, Riouw Linga Archipelago, Banca, Billiton, Celebes, the Molucca Archipelago, and the small Sunda Islands, and the western half of New Guinea. The total area of these possessions is about 735,000 square miles, and the total population approximately in 1912, 48 millions, of whom 104,817 are Europeans.Now, in the case of France, they have New Caledonia, which is about 800 miles east of Brisbane, with an area of 6,274 square miles, or 7,240 including its dependencies. Originally it was a penal settlement, but there have been no convicts sent there since 1896. In 1911, New Caledonia wdth the Loyalty Islands had a population of 13,138 free Europeans, 5,671 convicts, including several thousand at liberty, and 28,075 blacks. On January 1st, 1916, the population of convict origin numbered 2,895. I am not going into the productivity of that portion of the country : it is in the hands&quot; of a friendiy Power against whom we have no objection to make, and with whom we are in cordial co-operation, and I hope we always will be. The New Efebrides I have already referred to, which are administered under a Condominium by Great Britain and France, but the existence of this Condominium is satisfactory to nobody. There is also a portion of the French territories there. The French establishments in Oceania consist of the Society Islands, the most important of which is Tahiti, and they have also got the Marquesas, the Tuamota Group, consisting of Gambier, Tubuai, and the Rapa Islands.As to the populations bordering on the Pacific, these amount to some 645 millions, of which total the Chinese Empire has 320 millions. That leaves 325 millions out of the total population that are not represented by the Chinese, who are facing the Pacific Ocean ; Manchuria and Eastern Siberia, 10 millions ; Japan and Formosa, 50 millions ; Dutch East Indies, 35 millions ; British Borneo and Sarawak, -f million ; Indo-China, 17 millions; the Straits Settlements and Malay Peninsula, 2 millions; Korea, 16 millions ; &quot;Siam, 9 millions ; the Philippines, 8 millions ; Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, 6 to 7 millions ; South America, 60 millions; the United States, 102 miUions ; and Canada, 8 millions. I want to draw attention to the fact that out of those respective populations, when you come to look at the oversea Dominions by name, the combined population of the whole of them shrink into almost nothingness compared with any one of the populations of the great territories that impinge on the Pacific, and the future of the Pacific at present necessarily contem-plates protection from some of these huge jjop illations which may become our enemies in the future.Past Failures : Dominion Dissatisfaction.1 That the course of dealing with the islands in the Pacific in the past has caused great uneasiness and dissatisfaction in Australia and New Zealand can best be shown by a few quotations and a brief consideration of some of the past history of the region.   During the 1907 Imperial1 I am indebted for many of the facts and quotations under this heading to a useful summary appearing in Appendix to Report K&quot;o. 50.6273-4a C .
Conference the. then Prime Minister of Australia (Mr. Deakin), speaking on the subject of British interests in the Pacific, said : &quot; Some reference is necessaiy to the indifferent attitude of statesmen in this country, a not unnatural attitude, because, to the United Kingdom, the Pacific is remote, and not for the greater part of it even a highway of much traffic. On the other hand, to Australia and New Zealand in particular, and also to Canada, the future of the Pacific is extremely important, and may become more so at any time. . . . This difference of situation led from the first to a different attitude of mind on the part of the people of the Commonwealth and New Zealand, the people of Australasia, as compared with that of the people of the Mother Country. As a consequence, the course that has been followed, and consistently followed, in Australia has neither been understoocPnor appreciated here.&quot;Owing to the belief held in Queensland that the British Government was viewing German activity with indifference, the Premier of the State took the bold step of annexing part of New Guinea in 1883, but this act was declared by the British authorities to be &quot; null in point of law,&apos; and not to be admitted in point of policy.&quot; The Convention of the Australian Colonies, which was called to discuss the&apos; matter, provided the first occasion upon which the separate Colonies of Australia gave really joint consideration to the external danger threatening them through the action of a foreign Power. The Convention suggested that a Protectorate should be proclaimed over New Guinea and the adjacent islands (including the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon, Caroline. Pelew, Marshall and Ladrone Islands) under a single High Commissioner, but this scheme did not receive encouragement from the Home Government.I may here mention that the position in 1883 did not materially differ from the situation to-day in that the main groups of islands round the shores of Australia were practically under British control.The German flag, however, was soon after established in New Guinea, in spite of the protests of Australia, though it is true that the southern portions were brought under British * control, and subsequently taken over and administered by the Commonwealth under the Papua Act of 1905. As to the manner in which Australian feeling was met by the threatened . German annexation, Mr. Deakin pointed out at the 1907 Conference, &quot; I remember only too well the warnings transmitted to the Imperial Government with reference to New Guinea when we were assured by the . then Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord Derby) that there was no intention on the part of Germany to annex any part of that island. It was in this faith that the flag hoisted without authority by the Governor of Queensland, the British flag, was hauled down.&quot; As Mr. Deakin also pointed out, the territory regarding which the assurance was made was immediately afterwards appropriated by the German Government, and he continued, &quot; What is true of this island is true of the Solomon and the.Gilbert and the Ellice Islands. Whatever losses there are in the Pacific  and there have been others have been due to neglect here. Every single gain has been due to pressure from Australia and New Zealand ... Is it, therefore, to be wondered at that a feeling has been created which still exists in Australia an exasperated feeling-that British Imperial interests in that ocean have been mis-handled from the first ? . . . . We practically had these islands, or most of them, almost as much as we had Australia in the first instance. It is not a series of grasping annexations that we have been attempting, but a series of aggravating and exasperating losses which we have had to sustain. There you have our two absolutely opposite points of viewr, the point of view of our part of the world and the point of view of this country.&quot;As to the New Hebrides, in the last public utterance of Mr. Seddon (then Prime Minister of New Zealand), made a few hours before his death on June 10th, 1906, the unsatisfactory arrangements regarding the Condominium in the New Hebrides were referred to in the followiug words : &quot;The Commonwealth and New Zealand Govern-ments are incensed at the Imperial Government Conference fixing conditions of dual protectorate in the New Hebrides, without first consulting the Colonies so deeply interested. The Imperial Government calls upon us now for advice upon what is already.decided, making our difficulties very great. The entire subject is of vital importance to the Commonwealth and New Zealand. We ought to have been represented at the Conference. If anybody had been there for us who knew anything about the subject, the. result would have been very different. Whoever represented Britain, French diplomacy was too much for them. I cannot honourably say anything further. My hands and tongue are tied by the Imperial Government, but I wish I had the power of Joshua to make the sun stand still.&quot;
Samoa. .With regard to Samoa, Germany had established herself commercially in 1884, and began to press the other countries commercially interested (Great Britain and the United States) for a greater administrative control, basing this claim mainly on the native disturbances and the necessitj^ for &quot; repressive measures for the establishment of law and order.&quot; After a short period of Samoan administration by an Advisory Council -to the native King, the German Commissioner proposed that &quot;having regard to the great preponderance of German commercial interest in Samoa, the task of forming a better administration should be entrusted, in the first instance, to the German Government.&quot; Germany subsequently took action against the King (Malietoa) and drove him from power, in order &quot; to take reprisals,&quot; and he was afterwards deposed.By the Convention signed at Berlin in 1889 the Samoan Islands were declared to be independent neutral-territory, Great Britain, Germany, and the United States having equal rights, and the native King was again recognised. Owing, however, to unsatisfactory administration and differences between the Chiefs, the iSiew Zealand Government in 1894 proposed to establish a protectorate and to undertake the administration of the islands. Great Britain and Germany, however, took joint action against the natives, and in 1899 an agreement was arrived at by which the Government was to be directed by an Administrator under the Council of Consuls of Great Britain, Germany, and the United States, assisted by a native Assembly. Dr. Solf (the present German Colonial Secretary) was appointed as Administrator; but after just over a year the Anglo-German Convention of 1900 recognised the German control of the Samoan Islands. The attitude of New Zealand to this was wrell represented by the then Prime Minister (Mr. Seddon) w-hen he said : &quot; Some definite action of a forward character is required in the Pacific at the earliest opportune moment, for the surrender of Samoa has disheartened the natives in the island, disappointed the people of Australasia, and lowered the prestige of Great Britain in this part of the world.&quot;As a matter of fact, at that juncture, I held the position in the Ministry of the day, among other portfolios, of Colonial Secretary, and I put a very emphatic memorandum on record about it, and the late Mr. Seddon made strong representations, and yet Samoa passed away from British control, and to-daj&apos;&apos; it is one of the places which has been wrested from Germany in co-operatiou with the British Government. The New Zealanders early during the present war took possession of that island, and now hold it, in connection with which we feel the very strongest opposition to any possibility pi its ever reverting to any enemy, either the present enemy or any other.It should be remembered that Samoa is less than 3^ days&apos; steam from New Zealand with ordinary steamers, and that with a modern steamer the voyage could probably be made under three days.The Problem of the Future. To sum up the position, the present owners of islands in the Pacific are either.the nations of the British Empire, or nations allied to the Empire. Although the United States, France and Japan have the greatest interests of the countries amongst the Allied nations, there is no question that the interests of Great Britain and the Dominions in the Pacific are far greater than those of any of the Allied countries. It is therefore scarcely necessary to emphasise that the future control of Pacific seas and the great interests of the Empire in that area must be associated wdth predominant naval power, unless the interests of the British Empire are to remain, as practically they do at present, in the hands of other friendly Powers which have great navies. On this head it may be well to quote the words of one of the greatest naval authorities this country has produced, namely, the late Sir John Colomb, who said : &quot; The voices that call for real British unity are drowned by the shoutings for constitutional rights reverberating throughout the Empire from one self-governing State to another. Until a current of thought turns back to its old British channel of willing sacrifice in the discharge of duties to the Empire, the British future in the Pacific Ocean will probably be found, at no distant date, to rest upon the good nature of the United States or the tender mercies of Japan.&quot;This introduces an important subject upon which different views may be held, namely, the advisability of calling upon the United States to support what is called the Monroe doctrine for the Pacific. This, I hope, will not be favoured by the Mother-land. There has, so far as I know, been no desire expressed by the United States to extend that doctrine to cover territories in the Pacific, all of which are so important to the great, though comparatively young, British oversea nations which in turn are
of incalculable value to-day to the Homeland. These young nations will, as their expansion in the years to come goes on, become themselves, as individual or collective British dominions, of such enormous power and value that their interests assuredly call for the most far-sightecl statesmanship to-day. Therefore, it behoves those who are-responsible for Imperial policy to do all that is humanly possible to safeguard them from the danger of the passing of the Pacific Islands to the control of other countries who may, and certainly will, give them strategic and other advantages that in the future rniay menace the position of some of the great British dominions that we are-trustees for to-day.Plolding this view, it is necessary to consider in what way the British Empire can best meet the situation, and in this connection I submit that it is essential for those countries of the Empire who possess seaboards on the Pacific or Indian Oceans to join, together for the consideration of a scheme of commanding naval policy which wull insure not only the development of the capacity of production of naval and military material, munitions and supplies in these Dominions, but will also guarantee a close co-operation between them and the Motherland in the provision of naval force. Harbours, for wdiatever fleet or fleets reqtured, must be, and are now available, but up-to-date clocks, and constructive works for naval guns and naval equipment should be provided. As to what may be left to each individual country to furnish, must be a matter of joint consideration in conjunction with the Admiralty, for adequate provision and maintenance of naval force must largely depend on a central authority, upon which the Dominions are represented, who will control all the naval forces of the Empire, both in peace and in war. The advice of the British Admiralty as to the possibilities of future naval co-operation is of the first importance in this connection, for it is clear that without some joint consideration of the interests governing the defence of the various ocean surfaces of the world, it is impossible to estimate the demands of the future. It is not practicable for any one country of the Empire to solve the problem by isolated action, which may be based on political rather than strategic grounds, and in these days of great events and enormous warlike preparations, it will be impossible to face the future in the Pacific without that serious and joint consideration which the specific interests of the Dominions in that area, and indeed of the whole Empire, so urgently demand.
