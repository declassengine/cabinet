SECRET.AIMMIFOIATION OF THE ATTACHED WESTERN AND GENERALREPORT No. 92.PART I. -BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The suggestion for the representation of Dominion interests in Siberia has speedih&apos; borne fruit, and it is proposed that the small Commission that has been constituted shall co-operate with the British Commission.The intervention of the PojDe in a matter of such acute domestic controversy as bilingualism might in some circumstances be open to cpiestion, but his appeal against dissensions may be productive of benefit.The launch of the Victory Loan campaign enabled the Premier to voice Dominion sentiment as to the peace that Canada wants. Meantime peace discussions are having no influence upon the sending forward of reinforcements.The directions in which the proceeds of the last War Loan were employed should be noted.Newfoundland.In connection with the desire of the Newfoundland Government to obtain Newfoundlanders who are in the United States for their own regiment, it should also be remembered that at least 2,000 Newfoundlanders joined the Canadian forces.Australian Commonwealth.- The continued presence of Mr. Hughes in London has satisfied the Common-wealth Cabinet t hat at any rate for the present Cabinet representation in London is adecjuateiy provided for.The suggested representation of Labour at the Peace Conference manifests the same desire as that which prompted the suggestion some time ago that the Labour Leader of the Opposition should accompany Mr. Hughes to London (-wide Report No. 59).Other items of interest relate to the success of the War Loan, a suggested indemnity for Australia, &amp;c.New Zealand.The Parliamentary Session which has opened may prove of more political importance than the Government programme would seem to indicate.It is possible a Referendum on Prohibition will be held. [p.t.o.
South Africa.The somewhat peculiar position regarding the imports from the United States into the Union may incidentally have the effect of bringing the Governments of the two countries into closer relationship and co-operation in the future.British Colonies and Protectorates, &amp;c.The difficulties of recruiting the carriers in Rhodesia, which are so essential to the East African campaign, appear to centre round the grant of some comparatively trifling rewards. It should be remembered that von Lettow is not restricted in his supply of carriers in any such manner, and this fact might be borne in mind when considering the delay in his capture the views of the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia upon the post-war government of the country are of considerable constitutional interest.H. d&apos;E.October 31st, 191.8.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND  AFRICA.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Dominion Representation at Vladivostock. With regard to the suggestion that a Canadian representative should he appointed at Vladivostock to attend to the special interests of Canada (vide Report No. 88), the Dominion Government have now constituted a small Commercial Commission to represent Canadian trade and economic interests in Siberia, and to work in co-operation with the British Commission. The Dominion Government have asked the British Government for their approval, and have requested that the British Commission at Vladivostock may be notified.Military Convention with Italy. The Government have passed an Order-in-Council approving the draft of a military service convention with Raly. The proposed convention provides that all men of military age who are subjects of Italy, but resident in Canada, shall come within the scope of the Military Service Act. Other conventions are pending between Canada and France, Belgium, and Greece.&apos;Improvements in Military Service Act. The Government have recently passed several Orders-in-Council with the object of improving the operation of the Military Service Act. One Order provides that in future every employer must notify the Provincial Registrar of every person in his employ who is exempted or possesses a claim for exemption. Another Order provides that the Registrar who issues a certificate of exemption may renew or extend it if, in his opinion, it is desirable that the person concerned should continue the work upon which he is habitually engaged. These renewals, however, are to be subject to review by the Central Appeal Judge on the application of the accredited public representative.The Dope and Bilingual Controversy. The Pope has sent a Pastoral Letter to the Apostolic Delegate to Canada upon the bilingual controversy. In the course of this letter, he supports the appeal of the French-Canadians that inspectors for separate schools should be Roman Catholics, and that during the first year&apos;s tuition French-Canadian pupils should be granted the use of their own language for certain subjects, chiefly for teaching Christian doctrine. AR priests are urged to acquire knowledge of both French and English. The Pope admonishes severely all those, whether priests or laymen, who &quot;in opposition to-the Gospel and our injunctions, venture to foster and embitter dissensions that rise to-day in the Dominion of Canada.&quot;Peace Discussions and Oversea Reinforcements. The Department of Militia and Defence has given an absolute and unqualified denial to a rumour, which had gained credence in some parts of the country, to the effect that because of the possibility of peace there would be a suspension of sending reinforcements overseas for the present. Surprise is expressed in official circles that anyone could believe that Canacla&apos;s war efforts would be slackened in the slightest degree because of peace discussions.Launch of Victory Loan : Premiers Speech..- -The Victory Loan campaign was in-augu rated on October 28th, when the Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) signed the first application himself. The Premier in the course of his speech said : &quot; We all want peace in Canada.   Our men overseas want it when the time comes, but neither they
nor we want any peace until Germany has learned her lesson, and the world is freed from the menace that has been hanging over it for the last four years.&quot; Reports from variorrs parts of the Dominion show that subscriptions on the first day of the Victory Loan campaign exceeded those on the first daj- of last year&apos;s loan by several million dollars.Utilisation of Last War Loan. The Minister of Finance (Sir T. White) has announced that of the proceeds of the last War Loan appoximately $50,000,000 was provided for ships, $30,000,000 for spruce for aeroplanes, 837,000,000 for the purchase of cheese from Ontario and Quebec, $9,000,000 for the purchase of the exportable surplus salmon, while another portion of the proceeds had financed to a great extent the purchase of the exportable surplus of wheat. Besides paying her entire way since the war started, the Minister said that Canada had a surplus of bank Deposits. The September Bank Statement, just issued by the Dominion Treasury Department, shows that the total is in excess of $1,037,000,000, or nearly $23,000,000 higher than at the end of August, when the previous record wras made. Compared with September 1917, the depositors in the savings banks increased their accounts last month by upwards of $69,000,000.Abandonment of Strike Prosecutions. The representative of the Dominion Government at Calgary has received instructions from Ottawa that he should not proceed further with the prosecutions of the five men recently summoned for violating the Industrial Disputes Act.   (Vide Report No. 91.)Labour and use of Enemy Languages.-RejAymg to a recent labour deputation which asked for a modification of the order prohibiting all meetings in the Russian, Finnish, German, and other enemy languages, the Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) said there was no intention to interfere with legitimate meetings, but only with Bolshevist and revolutionary gatherings, and the order was likely to be modified.Military Service in United States. -In relation to a recent enquiry from the Government of Newfoundland as to the position of Newfoundlanders in the United States with regard to military service, the British Government have asked the Government of the United States if they will allow Newfoundlanders who have joined or.are joining the United States Army to join the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. The United States Government are also being asked whether they would allow the names and addresses of&apos;those Newfoundlanders who have been exempted from military service, on account of their not being domiciled in the United States, to be sent to the Newfoundland Government so that such men may be asked to join the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. While a separate Convention is not suggested, the British Government have intimated that they will be grateful if the United States Government can arrange to adopt the above suggestions.Cabinet Representation for Post-War Problems. The acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), referred on October 21st to the representation of the Commonwealth Cabinet in dealing with post-war problems (vide Report No. 91). He stated that the Cabinet had sent a cable to Mr. Hughes asking him, in view of the startling and dramatic changes in the war, to remain in Britain until the crisis had passed. One of the main problems Australia wanted settled was, he said, the future of the Pacific, and, he added &quot;no menacing power must have naval bases within striking distance of this country on islands taken by us.&quot;   Mr. Watt continued &quot;we are extremely anxious6633-5a a 2$100,000,000.In1 EWFOUNDLAND.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.
that British, American, and French statesmen shall realise what it means to keep the enemy&apos;s former possessions in the hands of the Allies. No man is better able to attend to this than Mr. Hughes.&quot;Referring to demobilisation, Mr. Watt said that two or three Australian Ministers might well be employed on the work of repatriation of Australian soldiers. Mr. Hughes would probably lay the basis oh the demobilising machinery.Labour Party and Representation at Peace Conference. In reply to a question whether, as Australia was to be represented at the Peace Conference, the Government would consider the advisability of allowing the Labour Party to be represented, the acting Prime Minister replied, according to Press reports, that if the Official Labour Party propounded such a request it would be considered by the Government.Imdemnity for Australia. A resolution has been passed by the Melbourne City Council asking that Great Britain shall insist upon an adequate indemnity for Australia, &quot; adequate security for its payment being found in the continuance of the present policy, enforced by the British Navy, of no German flag on the ocean until payment.&quot;Commonwealth IJress and German reply. The leading newspapers describe the German repby to President Wilson as a subtle, crafty document, full of transparent falsity. There is nothing, it is said, in the document above the level of specious, cunning word-spinning. The newspapers urge that Allied statesmen should combine in an express statement that the destruction of Germany&apos;s military power can only be effected by absolute surrender.Success of War Loan. The War Loan subscription list closed on October 29th. The most recently announced figures show that the amount subscribed is nearly 43,000,000Z. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) had previously stated his belief that the total would reach 42,250,000Z., and observed that in view of this highly satisfactory result compulsion would not be necessary.Votes for all reaching 18. A Queensland Government Bill enabling males and females to vote at the age of 18 years has been read for the first time in the State House of Assembly.  .Artificial Limb Factory. Twenty-nine returned soldiers are employed at the Commonwealth artificial limb factory at Victoria Barracks, which is admirably equipped. A soldier who lost a leg at Pozieres is manager of the factory, at which artificial legs only are at present being made, the output being at the rate of 35 limbs per month. It is intended to manufacture also arms and hands very shortly. The Australian-made limbs are entirely of basket or pith willow, the lightest and most durable timber obtainable for the purpose. -NEW ZEALAND.New Session of Parliament. The Parliamentary Session -was opened by the Governor-General last week. The Government programme, according to published statements, includes the prevention of the aggregation of land, remedies in regard to the cost of living, and measures concerning demobilisation and repatriation.Suggested Referendum on Prohibition. A deputation of the Prohibition Alliance of New Zealand has presented the Government with a petition signed by 242,000 electors asking for the prohibition referendum with compensation, in accordance with the National Efficiency Board&apos;s recommendations. According to published statements, the Ministerial replies express sympathy, but are non-committal.
SOUTH AFRICA.Imports from United States. The Union Government have been informed of the concern of the Shipping Controller, regarding the matter of securing further control over imports from the United States into the Union, in view of the increasing pressure on British shipping.   The doubt is expressed as to whether it will be possible to -continue to employ British liners on the present scale for transporting United States goods  that  are   urgently required  in South Africa.   It is understood&apos; that the appointment of a representative of the Union Government in New York to- work with the representative of the Shipping Controller is under consideration, but meantime the Shipping Controller remarks that there are now about 12 sailing ships and two Japanese   steamers,   employed in United  States-South  African trade, which are uncontrolled by the British. United States, or Union Governments, and are free to exact highest rates for carriage to the detriment of British liners wdiich were formerly employed in this trade.   It is therefore suggested that the vessels in question shoidd confine themselves to priority cargo as in the case of British liners, and that certificates for such cargo should be issued equally to all vessels carrying cargo from the United States to South Africa.   The Shipping Controller urges that in order to make the vessels available to relieve British tonuage, the Union Government should prohibit the importation from the United States of any article which has not received a priority certificate and import licence.   The classification of goods is also suggested as follows : (a) war purposes, (6) other essential purposes, (c) ordinary purposes.   The views of the Union Government are sought upon these suggestions. -BRITISH COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RHODESIA.Rewards for Native Carriers. With reference to the question of extending rewards to the native carriers recruited for the East African campaign from Northern Rhodesia (vide Report No. 88), it now appears that the November requirements amount to 1,750 and that the Administrator of Northern Rhodesia reports that no more carriers can be obtained except under compulsion, and that he would hesitate to continue compulsion without being able to make a promise of rewards such as that recommended last year. The High Commissioner for South Africa (Lord Buxtou) agrees that compulsion cannot be continued without promise of rewards. : Though he informed the Administrator that, after the despatch of October reliefs, only boys recruited on a voluntary basis should be sent forward, it was seen that the very small number available for November might seriously impede the progress of the British forces at a time when their action against General von Lettow was essential; and therefore it is proposed to despatch those natives who have been actually recruited, voluntarily or otherwise, towards the required 1,750, while prohibiting the further application of compulsion afterwards. It is pointed out that if the full November reliefs are to be obtained and subsequent requirements met, compulsion must be enforced, though this is only possible if a promise of rewards is associated wdth it.The proposed expenditure to enable the rewards to be made to the native carriers has not been approved up to the present by the Treasury and War Office.Legislative Council and Responsible Government. The elected members of the Southern Rhoclesian Legislative Council after a meeting (which was attended by all except one member) to consider the Privy Council land judgment,, issued a state-ment recognising that unalienated land has always been vested in the Crown and also acknowledging the right of the Chartered Company, on the termination of their -administration, to look to the Crown to secure reimbursement of the outstanding
balance of advances on account of necessary administrative expenditure. The state-uieiit records the entire agreement with the Chairman of the Chartered Company regarding the great Imperial work performed by the Company and assures the Com-pany that the people of Rhodesia will assist it in safeguarding the legitimate interests of shareholders: At the same time it is suggested that the Chairman might have meutioned the part borne by the people in assisting the Company.The statement proceeds to discuss the post-war government of Rhodesia, and after suggesting that the Company would not have financed the country on such a generous scale if they had known the land was not theirs and that such support may not be forth-coming in the future, it is pointed out that if the above inference is correct it follows that the country will be administered from its own resources and the people will have all the disadvantages of responsible government without the corresponding advantages. It is argued, therefore, that constitutional change is inevitable on re-establishment of post-war normal conditions. Three alternatives are suggested : (1) Responsible government, (2) representative government under the Crown, (3) Union, As to the last named it is submitted that incorporation with the Union can only be brought about by the will of the people, which cannot be obtained until they are masters in their own house. &quot; A representative government,&quot; the statement continues, &quot;is not provided either in the charter, the supplemental charter or the Orders in Council.&quot; To obtain a representative govern-ment prior to 1925 the consent of the Imperial Government and the Chartered Company is necessary, and possibly either or both will fail to agree, and, therefore, the elected members of the Legislative Council have no hesitation in advocating a responsible government, whatever its disadvantages in small communities. The position would be that the people would have the advantage of spending the fuuds which they themselves provide. The alternative of responsible government is, it is submitted, the only.one for which the people have the right to ask the Imperial Government. If it is refused on the ground that the country is not ripe for it, it is pointed out that the refusal would strengthen the hands of the people in demanding that the Imperial Government should arrange, with the Company&apos;s consent, for representative government.Colonel Raleigh Grey dissented from the memorandum, and submits that the country is not at present fit for responsible government either in population or finance. He advises co-operation between the representatives of the people and the Company for the improvement of economic conditions, and suggests an early conference to deal with matters of commerce and trade development, land settlement, &amp;c. He urges the establishment of a permanent Land Board for administrative development of land, especially of war settlement, a Government Department^ to promote commerce, and a permanent Railway Board to assist railway administration. He further urges the country to claim the highest form of representative government without executive control, and thus gradually to prepare for responsible government: Colonel Grey expresses the conviction that the only change possible is from representative government, whether under Company or Crown, to full responsible government.
