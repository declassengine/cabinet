OABIKET..Pi369(29)Fuller em piin Impploymont of Air Power wipe rial Defence.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty,The paper by the Secretary of State for Air,circulated as CoP*.332(29), suggests the establishment of a Committee to consider the division of responsibility between the fighting- Services.     I have no objection to the setting up of such a Committee on the understandipg that it would deal comprehensively with all the aspects of the division of responsibility between the three Fighting Services.20        My agreement to this proposal must not, however, be understood to imply that the suggestions instanced in the enclosure to GeP.332(29) are acceptable to the Admiralty,3c        As the proposed Committee would take cognizance of important issues connected with our National &amp; Imperial defence, it is suggested that the Committee, whatever its constitution, be a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence0     The terms of reference and composition of the Committee should in that case be settled by the C.I.D. itself.     It would be convenient in any case if the draft of them were circulated in advance to those concerned with a view to their very careful consideration before approval.4. I agree with the Secretary of State for ^ar thatin a matter of such prime importance to Imperial defence we cannot afford to be precipitate0     A Committee of the nature proposed will undoubtedly throw a great deal of work on the Admiralty.     I do not think it could be held whilst the Five Power Naval Conference is sitting, I suggest that the Committee should not sit until after the London Conference.A. V. A.ADMIRALTY, 3Jim20th December, 1929,
