Memorandum by the ,.Eoine Secretary.,This Bill which is one of 106 Clauses was not issued until last Saturday, the 23rd instant, and there has not been -much time to consider its provisions in detail.     It is substantially the same as the Bill introduced by Miss Susan Lawrence with the support of Mr. Greenwood; Miss Bondfield, Miss Wilkinson, Mr. MacMnder and Mr. Ammon in February 1928.The Bill concerns several Departments; besides the Home Office namely, the Board of Trade In respect of mines and ships, the Ministry of Agriculture in respect of employment in agriculture, and the Board of Education, but the Home Office is the Department mainly concerned both as regards employment in factories etc., and as being the central department for the employment of children and young persons generally0The Bill is a Bill for (l) consolidation and (Z) amend-ment of the law relating to the employment of children and young persons .(1) Its plan is to bring together in a single Bill all the provisions relating to employment of children and jonng persons.      It Includes the provisions of the Factory Acts regulating their employment in factories, the provisions of the Mines and Quarries Acts,  the provisions of the Education Aot relating to the employment of children of school age, and street trading by young persons, pro-visions of the Children (Employment Abroad) Act and a variety of other enactments.-1-
It is submitted that this plan is misconceived, and that to take away, for example, the Factory Act provisions out of the Factory Acts and to deal with the employment of young persons in factories as a separate matter would create difficulties both in legislation and administration, and is open to very serious objections.      The same criticism would apply to the employment of young persons in mines and quarries, and presumably also to their employment in Ships.(2)  She Bill proposes to regulate employment of children and young persons in all occupations by a series of general pro-visions, and to make the local authorities responsible for their enforcement in all occupations for which a Government Department is not already responsible..      It is submitted that this is ato impossible method...      The Bill recognises that the general pro-visions contained in Po.rt I cannot be applied universally^ for example, to domestic service and agriculture, and gives power in Clause 5 to the Governments Departments concerned to modify by . order any of the general provisions0      This is the &quot;new despotism&quot; in its extremist form., and would place on the Departments a task of enormous difficulty and responsibility if Parliament thought fit to accept such a proposal.The task of enforcement which is placed, on the local authorities would be no less difficult.      It is certcinly not too much to say that in the majority of cases It could not., and would not, be carried out, and the lew would become a dead letterv The; machinery for enforcing daily and weekly limits of hours in all the miscellaneous non-industrial employments of the country simply does not exist, and it is difficult to see how it could be devised even with an army of inspectors.     How, for example, is a check to be maintained over the-hours of employment of a girl of 17 employed in domestic service?   How would it be. possible to coerce thousands of private individuals to comply with the require-ments of the Bill?     Clause 9, for example, requires an employer
to give notice to the Employment Exchange within seven days of a child entering or leaving hi si employment.     Agodn,  Clauses 2 and Z prohibit employment of anyone under, 18 after 8 o1clock at night, or at all on a Sunday.     These two provisions would be quite -incapable of being enforced even though the local authorities appoint, as they are required to doB an army of inspectors, and were prepared to make a domestic visitation of the homes and premises of their area.(l) Employment of Children and Young Persons in g&apos;:ctories and&apos;workshops n-Turning to matters in which the Home Office isspecially interested, it is quite wrong that a Private MemberrsBill should attempt to deal with the amendment of importantprovisions in the existing Pvctory Acts at a time when theGovernment is promoting in the same Session a 3ill to amendand consolidate the whole law on the subject.     Further, youngpersons cannot be dealt with entirely separately from adults.The two are constantly working together in the closest associa-tion in many industries, and the proposals in the. Bill whichwould have the effect that there would be different hours for:-(i)    persons under 16,(ii)    persons between 16 and 18 and(iii)    persons over 18,would dislocate the work of the various factory industries whichare dependent to a considerable extent on the work of youngpersons between 14 and 18.Again, the proposed prohibition in Clause 2 of the Bill
of all employment between the hours of 8 p.m. and 5 ads. of ycung persons under 13 would have the effect of preventing night employment of boys &quot;between 16 and 18 which is at present allowed in continuous processes at glass works.? blast furnaces, paper mills and certain other industries.        This goes beyond not only the provisions of the &quot;vashingtcn Convention as to night employment of certain persons,  but beyond the Factories Bill of 1924, and various Factories Bills which have been promoted by the Labour Part:/ since that date, and which all provide for night work of hoys over 16 in continuous processes in certain industries.        It will be strongly opposed by the industries.(2)  Employment of Certain Persons over School Age.Outside factories, workshops, nines etc., there is no direct restriction at present on employment of young persons over school age.As regards employment  in shops, which perhaps is the moat important occupation after the industrial occupations, the hours are to some extent limited by the provisions of the Shop3  (Hours of Closing)  Acts, but the question of direct limitation and of conditions of employment generally in shops (both for adults and young persons) is one which the Government are intending to take up after the Facotries Bill is out  of the way.        It cannot be dealt with by a few sweeping provisions in the manner suggested in the Bill.        There is a great variety of conditions  (ranging from the departmental store    to the village shop)  which require differences of treatment and legislation will call for a good deal of consideration and possibly investigation by a Committee
Similar considerations also apply to employment in offices.Apart from shop and office employment there is a gr*at mass of miscellaneous occupations.Undoubtedly additional legislation Is required for regulating the employment of young persons in many of these occupations which are at present inadequately controlled or not controlled at all.     The Home Office recognises the need for such legislation and has had a Bill on the stocks for a long time for this purpose.      Legislation will not be easy.      One difficulty is to decide whether to proceed by a general limitation of hours as proposed in the Bill or by Home Office regulations or by bye-laws made by tile local authorities or perhaps by a combination of these methods.      It is submitted that if regulation is to be effective it must proceed on different lines from those of the present Bill,(3) ELgLOYIfiilNT ABROAD.The Government has already forstallad the provisions of the Bill on this subject by the Children (Snployment Abroad)  Bill which has passed the Lords and is now before the Commons.      The Government Eill raises from 15 to 18 the age under which a young person requires a licence before he or she can go abroad as a performer.       The present Bill (Part VII)  is much more drastic.       It would prevent all young persons under 16 from going abroad for such a purpose, and would raise the age from 16 to 18 in the case of bosrs, and to SI in the case of girls.      These proposals appear to go much too far, and would certainly he opposed by the professional associations.
Sup;;a,ested Attitude of GovernmentIff OFFICE,th November, 1929.It is submitted that the position has materially changed since the Bill of 1928 was introduced by Miss Susan Lawrrence.       The Government are now proposing to introduce three separate Bills, namely, the Hours of Employment Bill, the Factories Bill and later, the Children Bill, all of which will deal in some measure With the proposals contained in the present Bill.      It will be seen from what has been said that the provisions of the Bill either cut across proposals which the Government have at present under consideration, or are of a far reaching character, the possible results of which have been very imperfectly studied.If the Government do not wish to oppose the Second Reading of the Bill it is suggested that during the Second Reading the Government spokesman should express sympathy with the objects which the promoters have in view, but should point out that the, position has materially altered since the Bill of 1928 was introduced.        It should also be made clear that all the provisions relating to factories, mines etc, should be omitted from the Bill, and that the provisions as to the employment of children and young persons abroad should also be omitted on the ground that they are already being dealt with in the Government Bill.The general provisions of Part I of the Bill which cannot be applied universally as the Bill itself recognises, should also be omitted,  and in its place should be put powers subject to the general control of Parliament to regulate by order or by bye-law the employment of children and young persons in unregulated employment.       The re,.-.t  of the Bill &quot;would then be subject to consideration if the Bill obtains a Second Reading and goes to a Standing Committee.(Intd.) J.R. C. .
