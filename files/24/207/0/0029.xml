(this gOgUMg IS TH.* PR OP MY Off HIS BRIgAKNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERfflfcillT).1.     The general objects of the Bill are laudable, but it iaopen to a number of objections.(i)    It proceeds by picking out of existing or proposed legislation    - the bits relating to children and combining them in one Bill.     It is very doubtful whether this is desirable.     It is probably better, for example, that the employment of young persons in factories should be dealt with under the Factories and cognate Acts, the employment of young persons on ships under the Merchant Shipping Acts, and in mines under the Coal Mines Acts.(ii J   She Bill goes further than the Hours &quot;of Employment Bill in that it imposes on the hours of young persons from 16 to 18 more rigorous restrictions than that Bill contemplates. It is doubtful whether its promoters have taken sufficiently into account the inter-dependence in industrial employment of workers of 16 to 18 and adults.     Any further restrictions of this kind ought to follow after the Hours of Employment Bill has come into operation and after experience has been gained of its working.(iii)    It apparently excludes all persons under 16 from employment in mining, seafaring, and, to a limited extent, agriculture.     Industries will have to adapt themselves anyway in the course of the next year or two to the raising of the school-leaving age already announced and to the large declineE ORES..P.338(89).OA BIKE T.CHILDREN AND YOtMG PERSONS1  (EMPLOYMENT AND PRO SEO SIQff FBlLL.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.
- -which is going to take place anyway in the number of juveniles available for employment.     It seems to me rather to force the pa.ce to impose this further restriction on top of these other two very substantial fact ors.(iv)   A minor provision of the Bill requires the employer to notify to the exchequer-inge the engagements and discharges of young persons under 16.     This proposal really involves a truncated form of Working Certificate system which the two National Advisory Councils for Juvenile Employment ha.ve reoently considered with care. They both came to the conclusion that a better policy for bridging the gap between the age of leaving school and the cge of entering insurance was to raise the former and reduce the latter, and this is the policy embodied in the Unemployment insurance Bill.     Farther, it is doubtful whether any good purpose is served by substituting compulsion on the employer for voluntary co-operation with the Exchanges.     Trade Unions which place their young people in employment are likely to object strongly.(v)    In so far as the Bill encourages the regulation of conditions of industrial employment by Local Authorities instead of by the Central Authority, it is doubtful whether it ought to be supported.     The proposal involves the risk of varying conditions between different areas and a considerable possibility that agreements between organisations of workers and employers may bei!ignored or over-ridden.(vi)    Generally speaking, much further enquiry into the conditions of juvenile employment seems to be necessary before active support could be given to the
Jl U aBill, which clearly ought to follow ana not to precede the Factories Bill and the Hours of Employment - Bill.E.     X would suggest, subject to the views of the Home Secretary and the President of the Board of Education, that the questions raised by the Bill are such as might be referred to the national Advisory Councils for Juvenile Employment.     If this were agreed, I would confer with them as to any alterations in the constitu-tion of those bodies which might be desirable.     If this were promised, it might be possible to avoid a second reading of the Bill, with its consequent reference to the Standing Committee and the consumption of much time in fruitless discussion.(Intld. ) M..
