THE TWO-SHIFT SYSTEM. Supplementary Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Reports were obtained from the Factory Inspectors at the end of June this year as to the present position regarding the number of workers affected by the two-shift system.    These reports showed that 333 Orders were in use or likely to be used and that the number of workers covered by these Orders was 17&apos;400. Out of this number 148 Orders are reported to be used continuously and the number of workers employed under them is over 10,000. At the British Celanese works at Spondon alone some 3,600 workers are employed under a.two-shift Order.    Last month further inquiries were made at a considerable number of works with a view to forming some estimate of the   number of persons employed in factories with two-shift Orders who are not themselves working under the.Orders but whose work is dependent on the   work done under the Orders.    At these works,  69 in number,  it was ascertained that the number of such workers would be about 10,000.    These works included many of the more important works which have Orders, but 1 think it would be safe to say that the number of workers affected at present cannot fall short very far of 40,000.Kew Orders are being frequently applied for and the number of Orders granted this year alone is 93, affecting about 3,300 workers.I should like to clear away one misunderstanding which seems to exist With regard to the two-shift system.    The system has been criticised on the ground that it involves an earlier start and a later finish than was permissible under pre-war conditions.    This is not correct as regards the starting hour.    The starting hour cannot be earlier than 6 a.m. and 6 was and is the permissible
starting hour under the Act of 1901.    The criticism is    only-correct as regards the finishing hour,,    The general finishing hour under the Act of 1901 Is 8 p,m.    Under a two-shift Order it may he as late as 10 p.m.    Employment of women up to 10 p.in. has all along been permissible in the industries in which overtime was allowed by the Act of 1901 and was a very frequent practice. Another special exception in the Act of 1901 allows the period of employment for women and young persons to be from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. by Order of the Secretary of State,  and this is actually-operative at the present time in letter   press book binding factories and laundries in the Metropolitan area.As I have previously stated, very great care is taken by the Home Office, through the Factory Inspectors, before granting an Order to see that the    interests of the workers in regard to such things as transport, welfare,  etc. are properly safeguarded, so that any inconvenience that might otherwise arise from an early start or a late finish is minimised to a very great extent.I will summarise briefly the  points in favour of the system 1*    It gives more employment.2.    It reduces the hours of work from 4-8 or more to 41 or 42 in almost all cases.3.    It enables pressure of work and other emergencies to be met without overtime.4.    It is a means of bringing down overhead charges and decreasing oost of production.5.    It makes It possible to employ women on work which is suitable for them in cases where otherwise men would have to be employed at a greater cost,  e.g.  in a Department where two-shifts are necessary in order to preserve the balance with preceding or succeeding processes in other departments.Finally,  the question to.be decided is not a questionsimply of the merits of the system in the abstract.    The system isin being and the question for decision is - can we stop it and ought we to stop it?    This is a matter for the decision of theCabinet and it is necessary to come  to a decision at once if theBill, as I very much hope,-is to be introduced before Christmas.J.R.O.
