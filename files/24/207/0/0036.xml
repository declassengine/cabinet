9 3 4  c* ^S DOCuUHNT IS THE PROPERTY       HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNllEBT) .Q H E T. . 345 (S9hOOPY BO0 A 3 I g 1 g.umpioyment policy ,Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.I circulate for the information of my oolleagues a note forming the appendix to this memorandum, which shows, in the briefest outline, the principal concrete proposals put forward under the various healings of the pamphlet &quot;we can Conquer Tin employment51 together with the action taken or contemplated by the present Government under each of those heads.The Liberal Partyrs criticism of our unemploymentpolioy is based, as might be expected, on a comparison ofthat polioy with the grandiose schemes outlined in thispamphlet.     I am well aware that our programme cannot compare with the Liberal programme in the mere magnitude of theexpenditure contemplated, but with one exception   I am satisfied that on any standard of sane economics we need notfear a oomparison.     The objects on which the LiberalPamphlet proposes to spend are as a rule good enough, but thescale of the expenditure is out of all proportion to whatoan be economically justified.     Is it, for instance, commonsense to sink  145 million in an enlargement on a luxuryscale of a road system already admittedly the finest in theworld, largely at the expense of other forms of transport?We are already being criticised on account of the magnitudeofve some doubts about Telephone development (Para iii of the Appendix): present proposal ** merely an acceleration of  1-^ mills. - is very11 when compared with the proposal in Liberal pamphlet and i think3 is a matter which should be specially examined.
9 o rrW      (Jof the road programmes we have sanctioned.     What the Liberal Programme contemplates is a lavish expend!frare- ah what is really, in industrial terms, &quot;plant&apos;.     The expansion of plant far &quot;beyond any load -which it is likely to secure in a foreseeable future is what the armament and munition industries (steel, shipbuilding, eto*) were forced into during the war with results from which we are sti?,.! suffering,     The Liberals now propose a similar polioy for the public utility servioes of the country. We are not likely to cure the evil for which the economic polioy of the war period was responsible &quot;by applying that polioy to another sphere.To those critios who think that the merits of an unemployment progx-amme can be measured by the millions of expenditure which it involves, I have nothing to say.     As my colleagues   know I do not accept that standard.     If Government expenditure is to do any good, it mast earn Its keeps     SJo sojnandor our capital resouroes on schemes which bring no corresponding economic return can only do harm, and ultimately lead to an increase in unemployment.Judged by the more exacting standard of economic realities, our programme can well challenge comparison with that of the Liberals.     Not only is it economically sounder: it is also &quot;broader in its scope.     The proposals contained in the Pamphlet were put forward as a complete programme of national development.     Our programme of development at home covers a wider field.     The Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act allows assistance to &quot;be given over a wider range of economio development than appears to be contemplated &quot;by the Sdberal Party&apos;s Pamphlet, which contains no proposals for railway development, (except in relation to London Passenger Transport)   for dock improvements for water supply schemes, or for gas whioh has its proper place, along with electricity, in our economic system.     The last Governmentvirtually
virtually closed down the assistance for economic development by local authorities.     We have taken the view that local authorities have Schemes of economic development which can properly be put in hand;   this view has been borne out by the fact that the Unemployment Grants Committee have approved in five&apos;months for grant  12-13 millions of work whereas under our predeoessors the Committee approved only  6 million of work within the period of the last 2 years.     Further, the Liberal programme makes no provision for the development of the great potential markets in our overseas dependencies, for which we have provided funds under the Colonial Development Act, 1929.She Liberals pin their faith to a vast programme of works aided by financial assistance from the State.    They believe that this expenditure, if it is large enough, will by itself set in motion trade activity on a scale to swing industry round on to the upward grade again.     I do not share this easy faith.     My view is that the root cause of our unemployment is the weakened competitive position of our export trades in the worldfs markets since the war.     Unproductive expenditure at home can only add to this.weakness,As I indioated in my recent memorandum to the Cabinet, I believe tho only sound policy for dealing with the .prosent situation is one which, while giving the fullest possible scope to our home resouroes and means of produotion, is aimed primarily at tho restoration of the competitive efficiency of our export trades;    it is on this that I am concentrating my efforts.     In this connection i attach importance to strength-ening our  rade Commissioner Services overseas, and I propose to consider, in consultation with my colleague the President of the Board of trade the possibility of further missions on the lines of the B:Abernon mission to South America.     These are only instances of what can be done to assist our export trades.     I believe that in this sphere there are many directions
9 9 ndirections in which we can, by concentrated effort, stimulate flagging enterprise, start new trains of thought on problems of industrial organisation, and create a spirit in whioh industry will face the future with a renewed confidence,JoHoTc9th November, 1929,
? Q appendix.I.    ROADS MD BRIDGES,Ac    The paiaph.let proposes the following programme, to be completer, in two years:-mill;1.    Trunk. Ho ads 422.    Ring Roads 203.    Unclassified Roads 304.    Reconstruction of Bridges 375.    Special London Schemes;Victoria Dock Road 3Lower Thames Tunnel 3Others 10 16145This programme to be financed by a loan secured on the Road i-und revenues;    but part of the cost would be met by taxation on the increased value of land along the line of the new roads.Apart from considerations of finance and policy, the memorandum issued by the late Government shows that the execution of a programme of tnis magnitude in two yeors would be quite impracticable.Bc    The present Government nave approved the following programme:-  mill:1.    Trunk Roads(Extension of 1924-5 programme)    9-^- over4-5 years.   Major improvements of other important roads 27-1- over 5 years/In
9 9^KI &amp; Oin his memorandum of 13,th November, 1989 (N.S.(29)s) to the Conference df Ministers on National Sohemes, the Minister of (Transport has suggested the possibility of further extensions of the Trunk Road Programme, increasing the figure df 9^- millions above to 17 millions.In the same memorandum he has put forward for considerstion a further special programme, to include ring roads of 10 millions.As regards unclassified roads, local authorities have since 15th July put forward to the Unemployment Grants Committee proposals for expenditure of over  2^ millions.Of the special London schemes mentioned,  the Victoria Do-ck Road Scheme (about  2-g- millions) is now in progress, and negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily with the County Councils concerned with the Lower Thames Tunnel. Other important wozks in London quite recently agreed with the London County Council are the widening of Putney Bridge (say  jg- million),  improvements at Vauxhall Gross (say      million), South Circular Road additional improve-ments (say  200,000), with a probability of improvements^ at the Elephant and Castle.Urgent consideration is being given to the question of legislation to accelerate the process of land acquisition and to provide for s contribution towards the cost of schemes from the increased land values created./II. Housing
II.    HOUSING.A. The pamphlet says &quot;the right policy is to press on rapidly with the provision of houses at the lowest rents possible with the present subsidy and to begin the provision of urban houses at less than 10/- a week gross rental for the unskilled worker with a large family.&quot; It also advocates, in urban areas, the reconditioning of existing houses and the ereotion of modern flats.     Apart from the question of the reduction of the subsidy, concrete proposals for Government action are somewhat to seek.B. The present Government nave decided to continue the existing subsidy instead of reducing it in September, as proposed by the previous Government, but primarily as a matter of housing rather than of unemployment policy.They are proposing at an early date to introduce legislation providing for an organised attack on the slum problem.     The powers of local authorities will be strengthened and measures taken to facilitate and accelerate the work.     A primary consideration in dealing with slums is the provision of adequate housing accommodation for the persons displaced.     The Government proposals will be designed to secure that the necessary housing accommodation will be provided in advance and will take account of the consideration that many of the inhabitants of slums axe unable to pay a normal rent.
A. The pamphlet recites the familiar figuresof our telephonic backwardness end advocates an increase of  50 million in the capital expenditure during the next five years.B. The present Government has put in hand the acceleration of the trunk telephone construction programme by authorising an immediate commencement upon certain works involving an expenditure of  750,, 000 which would normally have been begun next year.      They have also sanctioned the acceleration of other works to a total of  750,000 which would otherwise not have been put in hand until 1931-32. These works will be additions to the main construction programme for which, during the current year, capital amounting to  10,500,000 has been provided.     The possibility of a more comprehensive programme is receiving consideration.
IV.      ELECTRICITY.A. The pamphlet advocates the stimulation of ^electrical development to the extent necessary to produce an additional expenditure over the present rate of  15^- millions during each of the next two years  (including expenditure on generating plant).      &quot;All that is necessary is to get Local Authorities and Power Companies to stimulate local demand and to assist them where necessary to raise the necessary capital&quot;.B. Present Government.     The Development(Loan Guarantees &amp; Grants) Act is designed to promote, inter alia, electrical development, and a circular was issued on 15th November, 1929, by the Electricity Commissioners with the approval of the Minister of Transport calling the attention of the industry to the terms of the Act.      It is estimated that capital expenditure during the next 5 years should be over  100,000,000;    and it is suggested that a considerable percentage of this could, with the assistance of the above-mentioned Act, be accelerated so as to fall within the next two years.The Central Electricity Board have let contracts for  It million since the beginning of July, and are doing all that is possible to speed up work in every direction.
0 /8V.      LAUD DRAINAGE.A. The proposals in the pamphlet are as follows :.-(4) Arterial Land Drainage.     The pamphlet recognises that legislation setting up proper Drainage Authorities will he required, but advocates the assumption of emergency powers by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.      Cost to be borne primarily at the public expense, but land which benefits should contribute.   508Q0O men should be employed within 6 months.(S) Minor Watercourses and Ditches also to be cleared,enabling 35,000 men to be employed, provided adequate State assistance Is given.(3) Field Drainage is not regarded as suitable forunemployment relief.B. The Present Government have decided that the passing of a Land Drainage Bill on the lines recommended by the Royal Commission is an essential preliminary to any new comprehensive Land Drainage programme, but the late Governments 1928 Land Drainage programme is being continued on more favourable terms and grants of 33i/3% (to be increased to 50$ If transferred labour is employed) are being offered to schemes of field drainage and rural water supply.
VI. LONDON PASSENGER, TRANSPORT .A. The pamphlet advocates a number of tube extension.and railway electrification schemes at an estimated cost of  17 millixnx and suggests that disagreements between authorities have been the primary obstacle to progress.     The only concrete proposal for Government action is that in the case of tube extensions, theState should own the railway leaoing the line to the existingcompany and making up any deficit frnm the proceeds of betterment&apos;and site value taxes.B. Present Government.     Under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, approval has been given to expenditure of  465,000 by the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway on electrification and other improvements in,&quot;the Dagenham district, to expenditure of  535,000 by the Great &quot;tfestern Railway for improvements at Paddington, and to expenditure of  270,000 by the Metropolitan Railway on station and signalling improvements.She Underground Group have put forward a  13 million scheme which includes a northward extension from Elnsbury Park and substantial Improvements beyond Hammersmith.The London &amp; North Eastern Railway have put forward proposalo for  925,000 expenditure on widening of&quot;the Old Great Eastern (Romford) line, and have indicated that they are oonsider-ing a proposal for electrification of the old Great Northern-suburban lines.VII. OTHER VALUABLE WORK   includesLand Reclamation.     The pamphlet makes no definite proposal but compares Government inactivity unfavourably with the alleged expenditure of  84 million in Italy.     The possibilities of land reclamation are being watched, but previous experiments in this direction have led to heavy loss.     There is an area in the Wash which may beoome suitable for reclamation a i  . the Ouse Drainage Scheme has been carried out, but as a rule land reclamation is unpromising economically.
The pamphlet oritioises the curtailment of the Forestry Commissions planting programme below a figure of 30,000 acres annually.     The present Government have increased the programme from 237,000 acres to 353,000 acres for the decade 1929-1939, which will enable the number of forest workers holdings to be increased from ^600 to 3,000.inland waterways into seven systems, each under a statutory body of trustees, te whom loans should be advanced &quot;on advantageous terms&quot;.     Under the Development (L*an Guarantees and Grants) Act, oanal companies are eligible for assistance, and the Grand Union Canal are proposing a scheme of some  500,000 expenditure, and the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation one of  108,000.   Further applications are expected as the result of disoussien with the Canal Association.specific proposal beyond premising to provide small holdings on a much larger scale than anything done in the past.     The possibility of extended provision of small holdings is being considered, but no large direct contribution to the relief of unemployment can be looked for in this direction.The pamphlet urges the grouping of canals andThe pamphlet does not make any
