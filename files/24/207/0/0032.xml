Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 341 (29).CABINET.REPORT ON RETIREMENT PENSIONS.Note by the Lord Privy Seal.1. I CIRCULATE herewith a Report on Retirement Pensions, the outcome of the work of a Sub-Committee of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Unemployment. The Report has not been considered by the main Committee, since it raises questions of first magnitude, which can only be dealt with by the Cabinet.2. I invite my colleagues to consider with care the three parts of the Report: (1) the description of the various schemes examined; (2) the addendum by the First Commissioner of Works and his Ministerial colleagues, putting forward a substantive proposal; and (3) the addendum by the official members of the Sub-Committee.3. The substantive proposal is, very briefly, that as a temporary measure we should offer Retirement Pensions for life (20/- to a man, 30/- if he has a wife) to 677,000 persons of 60 and over 390,000 of whom are expected to accept them  on condition that, if they are now at work, they give up their jobs, and, whether now at work or unemployed, never take employment again; only persons covered by unemployment insurance plus raihuaymen are to have the offer (agricultural workers, domestic servants and persons working on their own account being excluded). Unemployed persons who are capable of work are included, but the aged and infirm are not eligible. The offer is to remain open for six months only, latecomers not being eligible. It is thought by the First Commissioner and his colleagues that the retirement of 390,000 persons would create vacancies for 278,000 younger persons now,unemployed. The cost of the scheme is  21,600,000 for next year (falling to  10,000,000 by 1935-36), but, after deducting savings to the Unemployment Fund and to Local Authorities due to the employment of the 278,000 now out of work, it is estimated that the net cost of the scheme would be  10,400,000 next year after, allowing for the effect of the new Unemployment Insurance Bill, but these deductions give us no help towards the Budget situation. The net cost of the temporary scheme would continue to fall year by year (as deaths of pensioners occurred), and would be negligible after 15 years; but a further recommendation is added that there should be a permanent scheme, beginning in 1935, giving similar retirement pensions at 65. This scheme (which could include agriculture) would put up the cost of retirement pensions to  13,000,000 in 1935-36, to  18,500,000 in 1940-41 and to  22,000,000 in 1945-46.4. The documents attached provide material upon which the Cabinet can begin its consideration of these proposals, and I do not intend at this stage to offer detailed t observations. I must, however, draw attention to one point : the scheme proceeds i upon the basis that it is politically possible to offer retirement pensions covering only \ I-about 20 per cent, of the population over 60 and to erect and maintain barriers by 11 which the other 80 per cent, can be excluded. This is a vital point. Its importance J will be seen from the fact that if, as might very well be the case, it became necessary I Uo abandon the retirement condition and give unconditional pensions to all persons of I f 60 and over,. limited to the insurable categories, the additional cost to the State , p would rise at once to  65 million per annum.   It is not even clear that it would be[(possible to limit the scheme to the insurable categories.1 [20212]
5. The emergence of these proposals, immediately following the debates in the House of Commons on the 4th November and the 21st November, when references were made to the Governments unemployment policy, makes it essential that, in examining the new Scheme, the Cabinet should review the course of events since we took office, and should consider whether we are not running the risk that the country will think we are more concerned to give fresh &quot; doles &quot; than to improve employment. We began by asking Parliament for powers to aid development at home and in the Colonies my two Development Acts; in this part of the Session we have introduced the Widows&apos; Pensions Bill and the Unemployment Insurance Bill, and we have announced the intention to give children&apos;s maintenance allowances to ease the raising of the school-leaving age. All of these are necessary measures, in full accord with our policy, and there is no reason to question or criticise them. But we are now invited to take a further step and to offer retirement pensions to considerable numbers of workers, on condition that they cease to make any contribution to the wealth of the country, and this step is to be taken at once, as it is suggested that the Bill should be our next main measure.6.   In the meantime, with the approval of the Cabinet (Cabinet 41 (29), Conclusion 1, following the consideration of my paper CP. 287 (29)), I have announced our main unemployment policy to be an active effort to ensure the revival and expansion of industry, at home and in the Empire, by improving organisation, by re-equipment, by fresh capital, by better transport facilities.   This proposal does nothing to further that end.   Moreover, revival and expansion of industry no lone has yet pointed to any other practicable way of permanently reducing [/unemployment cannot come unless costs of production are lowered.   By whatever I measures of taxation we meet the expenditure involved by this scheme, together with I the increased expenditure on widows&apos; pensions and Unemployment Insurance under 1 the bills introduced this Session, the cost must tend even if it be indirectly to [hamper productive industry, and by raising the costs of production to contract the I volume of employment.7. I have endeavoured to set out the facts and some of the consequences of this proposal, but I am not unmindful of the fact that many of our Members are committed to some such scheme. I have refrained from dwelling upon the political difficulties that must be faced and, indeed, would be inevitable if any such partial proposals were laid before Parliament. I would suggest that a small Committee of Ministers should be appointed so that the Ministers responsible for the proposals should have an opportunitv of stating their case.J. H.

Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. D.U. (29) 67.CABINET.INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON UNEMPLOYMENT.Report by Sub-Committee on Retirement Pensions.To the Lord Privy Seal.Sir,.1. WE were appointed by your Minute of the 3rd July, 1929, &quot; to enquire into and report upon (a) Retirement Pensions to Industrial Workers, and (b) the Raising of the School-leaving Age, in relation to employment.&quot; As a result of the Cabinet decision to deal with the question of raising the School-leaving Age as an educational matter, this question was subsequently deleted from the terms of reference.I.-Introductory.2.   Our Report consists of three sections : I. A description of the various schemes which we have examined.II. An Addendum by the Chairman, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.III. An Addendum by the other Members of the Committee.3. Our terms of reference directed us to the consideration of retirement pensions for industrial workers in relation to employment. We have felt it our duty to review various possible schemes of this nature, to consider fully the arguments for and against them, and to state the advantages and the difficulties as they appear to us.4. Our task has been the consideration of schemes of retirement pensions in the first place from the point of view of the number of vacancies that are likely to be created by them for the unemployed workers, and, in the second place, from the point of view of their practicability, judged by cost and administration.5. We have interpreted the term &quot; industrial workers &apos;&apos; as covering in its widest meaning persons compulsorily insured under the National Health Insurance scheme, and we have necessarily borne in mind in considering the question of retirement pensions the fact that under the Contributory Pensions Act old age pensions at age 65 are provided for industrial workers and their wives, and that certain widows in industrial employment are in receipt of widows5 pensions.II. The Amount of the Pension.6. Before entering into an account of the several schemes, we propose to deal with the fundamental question, common to all the schemes, of the amount of the pension which should be provided for workers to enable them to retire from employment.7. It is clear that the value of a flat rate of pension, viewed as an inducement to workers to retire, will vary according to the relation it bears to the normal rates of wages among different classes of workers.   On the other hand, the grant of aCopy No.37
pension based on earnings and varying, therefore, in amount according to occupation and perhaps, though in lesser degree, to locality, would be attended by formidable difficulties. As the first step in obtaining a basis for a pension related to earnings, nominal wages would have to be discounted for losses arising from unemployment and sickness, and both of these elements, but especially unemploy-ment, vary widely between different industries and different occupational sub-divisions. Premising, however, that a satisfactory scale could be devised, the assignment of individual workers to their appropriate categories would present many difficulties and would lead inevitably to much discontent and to many actual disputes for the settlement of which an appellate tribunal would have to be established. Apart from these specific objections, the institution of a system of differing pensions provided from public funds would in all probability be condemned as offending against a general, if unreasoning, sense of &quot; fairness.&quot; Such an. attitude is found in many quarters to the variation of sickness benefits, according to the financial position of the different approved societies, in the system of National Health Insurance. Objections to varying benefits provided from contributions would be intensified if the public Exchequer was the sole source of the funds to be distributed.8. We are satisfied, therefore, that in any State scheme of retirement pensions it would be necessary to have uniform rates of pension irrespective of the rates of wages obtaining among different groups of industrial workers, although, under such a plan, certain of the best paid workers would not consider it worth their while to retire but would remain at work.9. In settling the amount of the pension it has to be borne in mind, as indicated above, that at the higher ages the risks of loss of income through sickness and unemployment are considerable in the case of a worker for wages, and that in the present state of industry the latter risk is particularly serious. A retirement pension, however, gives an assured income, the recipient of which is free from apprehension as to the contingencies in question, while, at the same time, he is released from the burden of daily toil, with its concomitants as to hours of labour and, in many cases, expenses, e.g., of travelling, incidental to his employment. These considerations alone would justify a substantial difference between the average amount of the nominal wage and the amount of the pension. To this must be added the general consideration that public opinion would discountenance the grant of a pension to an elderly or aged person of comparable amount with the wages of a younger man, whose earnings had to support the family responsibilities which in the course of nature the pensioner had no longer to bear.10. Having regard to these considerations, this Report is based on rates of retirement pensions of  1 a week to the single person and 30/- a week to the married couple, and also on the assumption that any pension, once granted, would have to be continued for life.11. With reference to the latter point we are conscious of the apparent inconsistency of paying to a person of advanced age say, 70 and upwards who, by reason of the weight of years, is no longer capable of work, a pension designed to keep off the labour market an elderly worker who is sufficiently able-bodied to be able to compete with his younger fellows for any employment which is available. But, on the other hand, we realise the extreme difficulty of withdrawing or reducing a State pension which the recipient had been drawing for several years and the permanence of which, irrespective of all other circumstances, would be alleged to have been part of the consideration which induced him to retire.12. Under the Contributory Pensions Act an insured person over the age of 65 receives 10/- a week and in the case of a married man his wife receives a further 10/-a week if she is over 65. As regards a person over the age of 65, the retirement pension should presumably be a supplementary pension of 10/- a week, so that, for a single person, the total income would be  1 a week and for the married couple 30/-. In the case of a married man who is receiving an old age pension of 10/- a week and whose wife is under 65, the supplementary retirement pension would be  1 a week, the total income thus being increased to 30/- a week.13. It is to be remembered as an important factor in considering schemes of retirement pensions, that a person between the ages of 65 and 70 who is in receipt of a contributory old age pension, or a woman of any age receiving a widow&apos;s pension, is
not prevented from working because he or she is receiving the pension, nor is the old age pension or widow&apos;s pension&quot; of this class reduced because of earnings or income. Similarly, a person over the age of 70 who is receiving an old age pension by virtue of his insurance has no restrictions placed upon him.III. Scheme A. MComprehensive Scheme of Pensions for Persons over theage of 65 conditional on retirement.14. The Contributory Pensions Scheme of 1925 which, as explained in Part II, gave a pension of 10/- a week to a man of the age of 65 and a further 10/- to his wife if over that age, has produced relatively little result in the way of inducing workers to retire and we do not therefore feel justified in putting forward an unconditional scheme of retirement pensions. We have accordingly assumed that retirement from work must be a necessary condition for the receipt of pension.Scope of the Scheme.15. It is appropriate that a general scheme of retirement pensions at age 65 should be related to the scheme of contributory old age pensions in defining the classes which should be eligible for pensions and that the retirement pension should be supplementary to the existing contributory old age pension.16. In framing this general scheme we have accordingly included, subject to certain conditions, all classes of workers who are compulsorily insured under the National Health Insurance system. Particular considerations arise in the case of domestic servants and persons in agricultural employment, and as a matter of convenience these are examined in connection with an alternative scheme with which we deal later in this report. The plan which we now discuss is accordingly one of practically universal application within the limits of the National Health Insurance system, with a retirement age of 65.17. In addition to the persons over 65 who would be working when a scheme of retirement pensions came into operation, it is necessary to consider the question of persons over 65 who would not be in employment at that time. Bearing in mind the specially high rate of unemployment at the higher ages it is certain that large numbers of insured persons, in receipt of contributory old age pensions, are unemployed, though available for and seeking work. It would be difficult to exclude them from a permanent scheme of pensions on the slender ground that they were not working when the scheme was introduced. Even if the supplementary pension were not issued automatically, the unemployed pensioners would undoubtedly contend that they should have the opportunity of qualifying for it by returning to work for a short minimum period, and they would to some extent defeat the object of the scheme by entering into competition with the younger men for the places vacated by those who retired from work on receiving the pension. Accordingly, we came to the conclusion that we must examine a scheme under which all persons over the age of 65 in receipt of contributory old age pensions would be given the benefit of the scheme whether they were in employment or not at the time it came into operation.18. Although the great majority of persons aged over 65 in industrial employ-ment are in receipt of pensions under the Contributory Pensions Act, there are some thousands who have failed to qualify for this pension by reason of failure to satisfy the statutory conditions. Despite any criticism which might be levelled against the exclusion of certain workers from participating in a general scheme, it is clear that if the scheme is to be supplementary to the contributory pensions scheme, then one of the conditions for the receipt of a supplementary pension should be that the worker is entitled to a contributory old age pension. To this extent a certain number of workers over the age of 65 would have no inducement to retire from work, while others not at present employed, and not in receipt of a pension, would compete with younger men for the vacancies created by the retirement of those on whom the pensions were conferred. If to meet these difficulties a pension were granted to insured persons over 65 Avho had failed to qualify under the Act of 1925, such pension would have to be of the full amount of 30/- a week for a married man and  1 a week for any other insured person.   It would thus, in effect, include
the contributory pension with the result that the provisions of the Act as to qualifying contributions would cease to have a meaning. It would inevitably follow that the insured person&apos;s incentive to secure the payment of contributions due in respect of him would be seriously weakened, with the result that the contributory basis of the Act would be much impaired.Estimated Number of Retirements.19. Contribution cards are required to be stamped in respect of all workers over the age of 65 engaged in insurable employment, and from the number of stamped cards received for the half-year from July to December 1928 it is estimated that, in all, about 315,000 men over the age of 65 are insurably employed. This number includes, however, some 20,000 men who are not in receipt of contributory old age pensions and who, as we have suggested, would not be eligible for a supplementary pension. The following conclusions are, therefore, based upon the effect of the scheme in relation to the actual number of pensioners working, which in the case of men is taken as 300,000. A large proportion of the contribution cards received in Great Britain have been classified with reference to the number of contributions paid, and from the results of the examination it may be concluded that of the whole class of men who are working at ages over 65, two-thirds are in fairly regular employment, and one-third are intermittently employed. Of the latter class about one-half are employed very intermittently.20. Of the 300,000 men pensioners who are working it may, therefore, be concluded that 200,000 are in regular employment and 100,000 are working intermittently.21. Of those who are regularly employed, it is unlikely that a large proportion would take an extra 10/- a week in lieu of their wages. They are already receiving a pension of  1 a week if married and with wives over the age of 65, or 10/- a week if otherwise, in addition to their wages. A pensioner with a wife under the age of 65 would receive an extra  1 a week in lieu of wages, and to this extent the inducement to retire would be greater in his case.22. We venture as an opinion that one in three, or say, 70,000 may be taken as an estimate of the retirements which the scheme could be expected to attract among the 200,000 regular workers.23. As regards the 100,000 in intermittent work the examination of the cards shows that, on the average, this class has stamps on its cards for about one-half of the weeks in the period. This means that the individuals concerned are on average employed for less than one-half their time, remembering that a stamp is attracted by any work done in the week however short its duration.24. It would appear probable, therefore, that the great majority of this class would accept a supplementary pension. It would probably be safe to assume that four-fifths, say, 80,000, would take it. On these estimates the pension would be taken by 150,000 men.25. Coming now to the case of women, the number of workers over 65 is probably in the region of 55,000. No statistics have been obtained as to the contri-butions of this class, but it would probably be safe to assume that 30,000 are in regular employment and 25,000 are working intermittently. The respective members who would accept the retirement pension may reasonably be put at 15,000 and 20,000.26. The withdrawal from industry of these 150,000 men and 35,000 women aged 65 and over could not be expected to result in the absorption of an equivalent number of men and women now employed. For reasons elaborated later (para-graphs 88-96) in connection with an alternative scheme, we do not think we can count on vacancies being created to a greater extent than would be equivalent in total to continuous employment for 75,000 men and 20,000 women. The scheme might be expected to result, therefore, in a grant of 185,000 pensions to working men and women, employed and unemployed, and to create vacancies equivalent in total to continuous employment for 95,000 persons. The corresponding number of persons put into work, subject to the ordinary risks of unemployment and sickness, may lie estimated at about 110,000.
Total Saving 4,000,000 900,000 10,000,000 2,000,0001,500.00018,400,000  3,800,000940,0004,740.000* The figures relating- to the saving to be expected in respect of doiniciiiary relief have been obtained roin returns furnished to the Minister of Health by Boards of Guardinns and from the results of special &apos;eturns obtained from the Boards of Guardians of fourteen selected Unions in England and Wales.27. The cost of the grant of the supplementary pensions to the 185,000 persons who might be expected to retire from work at the rate of 10/- a week, with an additional 10/- in the case of a married man whose wife was under 65, would approach  6^ millions a year. This, however, is only a small part of the total cost. We have suggested earlier (see paragraph 17) that it would be necessary to extend the scheme of supplementary pensions to those present pensioners over 65 who are not now working. So far as men are concerned, the cost of this extension would be about  10 millions in the first year. The corresponding figure for women may be put at  2 millions. The total addition to the Pensions Bill in the first year would thus be  18-1 millions.28. A point of some importance arises with regard to the item of  10 millions and the related item of  2 millions for women. These items, representing the cost of additional pensions to persons who have already given up work, are consequently not in any way dependent on the success of the scheme in inducing aged workers to retire. The charge of  12 millions is inevitable, assuming this class to be included, and, even if the scheme should fail so far as concerns its object of creating vacancies for younger people, this particular element in its cost would be realised to the full.29. The saving to the Unemployment Fund resulting from the scheme might approach  3,800,000. There would be a corresponding but much smaller saving in respect of poor law relief. While the scheme would involve a direct charge on the Exchequer, beginning at  18-1 millions a year, there would thus be a saving under other heads of public expenditure of about  5 millions a year. It is open to question whether the smaller item may be set off against the larger, since the Exchequer provides only one-third of the income of the Unemployment Insurance Fund from which the cost of unemployment benefit is met, while no part of the cost of outdoor relief under the Poor Law is met from taxation. If, however, this method of com-putation be adopted to obtain the broad effect of the scheme, the conclusion is reached that from public funds there would have to be provided a net sum of about  124 a year in respect of every person under the age of 65 for whom employment was found.30.   The summary of estimated cost at the outset is as follows :-Supplementary Pensions of 10/- a week to (i.) About 150,000 men aged 65 or over now at work (ii.) About 35,000 women aged 65 or over now at work (iii.) Men already retired(iv.) Women pensioners (in their own right) already retired Additional Pension of 10/- a week to married men over 65 whose wives are under 65Total of Direct Cost to Exchequer ...Savings (A.) To Unemployment Fund-Reduction of Benefit Cost in respect of unemployment(Of the saving under this head one-third will eventually accrue to the Exchequer (in reduction of the unemployment contributions), and two-thirds to the employers and workers.)(B.) To Local Bates *Saving on domiciliary relief to old age   pensioners   with    a   contributoryqualification     ...          ...          ... 720,000Saving in domiciliary relief to persons under 65 at present unemployed   .... 220,000
31. The net cost to public funds of all kinds would thus be  13,660,000. This cost would increase continuously for many years with the increase in the population over 65. It is estimated that for men alone the total cost in 1950 of 10/- a week, granted on the condition of retirement from employment, would be over  25 millions a year.32. In this connection, we think it appropriate to look at the question from the point of view of the numbers of the population within the working ages on whom would fall the burden of maintaining the aged were a permanent scheme of retirement pensions adopted.33. The following statement shows approximately the male population of Great Britain between the ages of 16 and 65, in contrast with the population, male and female, over the age of 65, and the estimated populations in corresponding categories in 1960 and 1980 respectively : Total Population ao-ed Year. Male Population, 16-65. 65 and over.1929    ... ... 13,900,000 3,140,0001960    ... ... 15,640,000 5,220,0001980    ... ... 15,240,000 5,835,00034. These figures show that whereas there are at the present time 4 - 43 men at the working ages to every person over 65. the proportion will fall in 1960 to 3 00, and in 1980 to 2-61.Condition of Retirement.35. As an essential condition for the receipt of a supplementary pension under the scheme, it would clearly be necessary to require a pensioner to give an undertaking not to take up employment. The question then arises whether the supplementary pension should be permanently forfeited if work were taken up, or whether the undertaking should be regarded as covering only those weeks for which the pension was drawn. On the one hand, it might be difficult to justify a condition imposing abstention from work for life whatever opportunities of temporary or seasonal work might offer themselves. On the other hand, unless permanent suspension followed the taking up of work the pensioner would not be withdrawn from the pool of those seeking work, and, when opportunity offered, he would forgo the supplementary pension of 10/- a week and take up any employment which offered more than this amount. In fact, the supplementary pension would become a form of unemployment benefit to workers over the age of 65. The balance of advantage seems to lie in the imposition of a condition that if a person receiving the supplementary pension resumed employment his supplementary pension would be permanently forfeited.General Remarks.36. The foregoing paragraphs set out in some detail the results of the examination made of a comprehensive permanent scheme of retirement pensions for persons over the age of 65 considered in relation to employment. We must confess that our estimates of the number of workers who would be induced to retire are largely guess-work, but it is clear that the greater portion of the cost of this scheme would be in respect of the granting of the pension to persons whose acceptance of it would not create vacancies in industry.IV. Scheme B.   Restricted Scheme for Certain Industries.37. One result of our examination of the comprehensive scheme for persons over the age of 65 was to suggest that we might profitably examine the possibility of framing a restricted scheme of retirement pensions for workers in certain industries as one in which cost might be more closely related to results. Among the more obvious drawbacks to the over-65 scheme is the fact that the results are likely to be meagre because of the small inducement to retire offered to the regular workers by a supplementary pension of 10/- a week in place of wages, while a large proportion of the total expenditure is in respect of joensions to persons already retired.
38. To avoid these weaknesses we have considered the possibility of fixing the minimum age of retirement at 60, and of limiting the scheme to persons in the selected industries who are still effective competitors for work. So far as workers between the ages of 60 and 65 were concerned, the inducement to retire would be much greater, in that they would be compensated for the loss of wages by the total retirement pension of  1 a week if single, and 30/- a week if married.Scope of the Scheme.39. In selecting classes of workers for inclusion in a restricted scheme of retirement pensions, we came to the conclusion that discrimination could most justifiably be made in favour of those classes among which there is a high rate of unemployment with a consequent large surplus of labour, and in which the persons employed are for the most part engaged in work of an arduous nature.40. In coming to this conclusion we were also influenced by another factor. Improvements in mechanical processes and in production organisation have been in progress for some time, and, although they are economically beneficial, their immediate effect has been to intensify the problem of unemployment. It is clear that in certain heavy industries the considerable surplus of labour which exists to-day is due not only to temporary industrial depression, but also to a permanent change in economic conditions, and it has to be recognised that those industries will not be able to absorb the whole of the surplus of their workers, even with a general revival in trade. (See Report of Industrial Transference Board, page 54, and generally.)41. At the outset we were confronted with the difficulty of determining the method by which the classes of workers to be included in the scheme should be denned. Considered from the point of view of surplus of labour, it is clear that definition is most easily obtained by reference to the industrial groups as classified for purposes of unemployment insurance statistics. If, however, the primary test were to be that the workers are engaged in heavy manual work, definition of groups could be obtained more exactly by reference to occupation. Whichever method were to be adopted, great difficulties of demarcation would inevitably arise, and on the whole it seemed better to us to concentrate our attention upon the following industries :  (1.) Coal Mining.(2.) Pig-iron Manufacture.(3.) Steel Smelting, Iron Puddling, Iron and Steel Rolling, Forging, &amp;c.(4.) Shipbuilding and Repairing.42. Whilst the work in the four selected industries includes much that is of a heavy character, it also includes a proportion of lighter work, particularly among those occupations which are found in nearly all industries. But the four industries as a whole are suffering from severe depression, which affects all the groups of workers engaged in them, and accordingly we have assumed that it would be necessary to include all the workers engaged in those industries, irrespective of the nature of their work.Conditions of Scheme.43. We are satisfied that it would not be possible to justify a restricted scheme of this nature financed by the State except as an emergency measure with the express purpose of relieving the present unemployment position. Accordingly, pensions should be made available only to those persons whose retirement would create vacancies for younger men, or to those persons between the ages of 60 and 65 who are actively seeking work and whom it would be necessary to withdraw from competition with the younger men.44. With this in mind we provisionally framed the following conditions as suitable tests for selecting the workers for whom pensions should be made available : (1.) In the case of workers between the ages of 60 and 65 the pension should be available to an insured person-(&amp;) who was working in one of the selected industries on a fixed date (a date necessarily anterior to the announcement of the scheme), or
(b) who belonged to one of the industries and was drawing unemployment benefit on that date, or who in the year immediately preceding the fixed date, for a minimum period to be prescribed, had either been employed or in receipt of unemployment benefit,on condition that he retired from employment within a certain period from the date of coming into operation of the Scheme.These tests would necessarily exclude persons who had been disabled for such a period within the year that they could not satisfy the test under (b) above.(2.) In the case of an insured person over the age of 65, the pension should be available, conditional upon retirement from work within a certain period, if he belonged to one of the industries, and if, during the year immediately preceding the fixed date, he had been employed for a minimum period, say, 39 weeks, provided that, if not actually employed on the fixed date, he was still available for and seeking work.45. As a condition of receiving the pension the pensioner would be required to refrain for the rest of his life from any form of insurable employment, failing which the pension would be permanently forfeited.Numbers Affected and Cost.46. For the purposes of estimates, we have assumed as the appointed day for this scheme the 1st April, 1930. The estimate of the number of persons in the industries over the age of 60 (preponderantly men) is as follows :  Ages Ooal Mining-. Iron and Steel. Shipbuilding.60-65 ....... 48,500            10,900 11,10065-70 ...         ... 20,400              5,200 5,800Over 70 ...          ... 8,000             2,000 1,80076.900 18,100 18,700Total   ... ... 113,70047. It will be seen that these numbers include some 43,000 persons over the age of 65, of whom it may be assumed that about 25 per cent, would be ruled out as being unemployed and not having the prescribed amount of employment to their credit in the previous twelve months. The number of qualified persons is thus reduced to 103,000.48. All under the age of 65 who are unemployed, and have been unemployed for a long period with practically no hope of getting work, could be expected to take the terms offered. The estimated rate of unemployment among men over 60 in this group of industries is about 25 per cent, (being about one and a half times the general rate of unemployment for the group), and it may be assumed that those who are permanently unemployed or practically so represent 20 per cent, of the whole number between 60 and 65, or about 14,000. As to those who are at work, it may be assumed, regard being had to the high wages of skilled workers in the iron and steel trades and of piece-workers in the mining industry, that 80 per cent, of the labourers (and in the mines day-wage men) and 20 per cent, of the skilled men, other than the foreman class, would retire. As to those of the employed who are over the age of 65, and already in receipt of the contributory pension, the proportion of the lower-waged who would be induced to retire by the supplementary pension must be taken at a substantially smaller figure, and 40 per cent, has been adopted. The effect of these assumptions is shown by the following summary : vr   .. T   ,       . ASes 60-65.

49. The cost of the pensions in the selected heavy industries on this basis-would be about  3,200,000 in the first year. On the understanding that the scheme would, in fact, be limited to those to whom it was applied on a particular &quot; appointed day,&quot; i.e., that no man reaching the age of 60 after that day would draw any benefit under it, the charge would diminish rapidly chiefly as the result of pensioners passing over the age of 65 and drawing their pensions under the Act of 1925, when the &quot;scheme&quot; pension would be cut down to the supplementary 10/- (or  1 so long as the wife of a married man was under 65). In 1935-6 the &quot;cost on this basis would be about  1,300,000. After this year the diminution of cost would slow down since all would be over 65, and practically the only relief to be obtained would be that attributable to deaths of pensioners.50. It is necessary to estimate next the number of vacancies which would be created for men who are at present unemployed by the acceptance of 52,000 pensions conditional upon retirement. In Scheme A, which related to persons over the age of 65, we were led by various considerations to the conclusion that the proportion of vacancies to be filled by men now permanently unemployed would represent whole-time work for approximately 50 per cent, of the whole number of retirements. In the present instance the scheme includes a group of workers between the ages of 60 and 65 in which the proportion of replacement would tend to be higher, but against this must be set the facts that these industries, by hypothesis, contain a marked surplus of labour, and that the employers are naturally exploring all methods of obtaining more economic production. Setting these considerations against each other we see no reason for anticipating a higher percentage of replacements in this scheme than in the previous one, namely, 50 per cent., which gives the number of years of continuous employment as 26,000, representing about 30,000 persons put into work and subject to loss of time through unemployment and sickness.51. The resulting relief to the Unemployment Fund would be about  1,000,000 in the first year. This relief would steadily diminish as pensioners, who had been induced to retire, reach the age of 65, when a certain proportion of them would in any case have left the labour market on entering upon their pensions under the Act of 1925.52. The saving to the Poor Law which may be expected to accrue from the scheme would probably be very small. The local authorities might possibly save in the first year about  100,000 under this head.Difficulty of Definition.53. We are first faced with the difficulty of justifying a scheme of which the cost is placed upon general taxation, and therefore upon industry as a whole, and which is to be applicable only to n- few selected industries; the scheme in effect constituting a subsidy for those industries. But putting on one side this fundamental difficulty, the question of definition of these particular industries and of the classes of workers included presents serious difficulties.54. The following are a few examples of the difficulties in question. In the class of Steel Smelting, Iron Puddling, Iron and Steel Rolling, Forging, &amp;c, it is hard to say when the manufacture of iron and steel ends and the making of things out of iron and steel begins. Ingots, blooms, billets, &amp;c, fall definitely within the line; such articles as, e.g., riveted bridges, roofing and other girder work, or barbed wire definitely without. Between these limits there is a group of semi-manufactured articles of which the following are classed with iron and steel manufacture for Census and Unemployment Insurance purposes, viz., angles, axles, armour, plate, bars, rolled joists, rails, rods, &amp;c. These are all classes of semi-manufactured material produced by steel rolling mills and works.55. In Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing a definition was drafted to limit the employment to that in a shipbuilding and ship-repairing establishment and to exclude the separate industry, marine engineering. This exclusion would entail difficulties and anomalies, since engineers engaged on the erection of the ship&apos;s machinery may be&apos; working side by side with the ship constructors. In so far as unskilled workers pass from constructional departments to the engineering depart-ments there would be a class of &quot;in and out&quot; men. The same problem arises in respect of the general labourers who are in and out of the selected industries a&amp;
opportunity oilers. In any ship-repairing centre, for instance, a large number of the general labourers will be found to have had more or less recent spells of employ-ment in the ship-repairing yards. Similarly, amongst the skilled men, platers, riveters, woodworkers, painters, plumbers, move freely between shipbuilding and general or constructional engineering and the building industry. In all such cases there would be difficulty in establishing proof that particular individuals have or have not qualified for pension. The administrative investigation necessary would be formidable and, however carefully and justly the work was done, there would inevitably be resentment and jealousy in numbers of cases.56. Definitions were drawn up on the assumption that the scheme should embrace all workers employed in the industries and establishments concerned subject only to the exclusion of Avorkmen employed in separate branches or departments engaged in some other business. For instance, where a steel works is connected with a bridge-building yard or engineering works, the latter would be excluded. Such discrimination between groups of workers under the same employer would be bound to create friction. There would also be considerable difficulties in &quot; border line&quot; establishments owing to the fact that their productions, or processes of manufacture, cut across the lines of demarcation suggested.57. If regard were had to the occupation of the worker rather than to the business of the employer an obvious result would be to exclude all the maintenance staffs in the establishments concerned. Tor example, it is very doubtful whether the fitters, mechanics, smiths and so on employed at a coal mine are strictly engaged in coal-mining.58. Whether a scheme such as this is examined from the point of view of the selection of industries or from the equally difficult standpoint of the accurate demarcation of the particular industries, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is impracticable.V. Scheme C.   Emergency Scheme for Workers over the Age of 60.59. We have shown that a permanent scheme of retirement pensions, limited in its application to persons over 65, would create comparatively few vacancies in relation to its cost. We have also discussed the possibility of introducing an emergency scheme restricted to certain industries, and have shown that such a scheme, while also producing little relief to unemployment in comparison with its cost, would be attended by almost insuperable difficulties, both on the grounds of policy and administration. Putting these schemes aside, therefore, we have proceeded to examine the question whether a purely temporary scheme of wide scope for workers over the age of 60 could be devised to secure greater results, measured by the number of men placed in employment in relation to the total cost.60. With this end in view, we considered that the restrictive conditions formulated in connection with scheme B would constitute a basis for limiting the scheme to persons actually in the labour market. These conditions are, briefly, that pensions should be conditional upon permanent retirement from work within a fixed period, and be available to persons between the ages of 60 and 65 at the commence-ment of the Act who are working or seeking work, and to persons over the age of 65 at the commencement of the Act, who are then effectively employed.Scope of the Scheme.61. In considering the classes of workers to be included in a scheme of general application to industrial workers, we naturally turn to the existing State schemes of National Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance, in order to obtain an accepted and unambiguous definition. Broadly, the persons compulsorily insured for health insurance purposes are those who are (a) engaged in manual labour, or (&amp;) are otherwise employed at a remuneration not exceeding  250 a year. The Unemployment Insurance Scheme covers practically the same classes of the employed population, with the exception of agricultural workers, private domestic servants and railway men.62. The exclusion of these three large classes from the Unemployment Insurance Scheme (which, of course, is on a contributory basis) has always been defended on the ground that they are not subject to the same risks of periodic
unemployment as the general industrial population. Prom the point of view of a. Retirement Pension Scheme, however, this consideration has little relevance, and it will be observed that the new scheme of Widows and Old Age Pensions, set up under the 1925 Act, covered the broader field of the Health Insurance Scheme.63. Notwithstanding that that scheme also is on a contributory basis, the high value of the benefits conferred in relation to the amount of the contributions, especially in the earlier years of the scheme, has led to considerable agitation on behalf of classes of the community who, though outside the scope of the Health Insurance Scheme, are not usually regarded as any more able to provide for widow-hood and old age than the classes included therein. If, therefore, one were con-sidering this matter of Retirement Pensions purely from the point of view of an equitable distribution of State grants, it would be difficult to justify the exclusion of agricultural and railway workers and domestic servants.64. We are directed, however, to look at the matter with special reference to the effect of any such scheme on unemployment. Prom this point of view railway workers should clearly be brought within the scheme. On the other hand, we doubt whether a Retirement Pension Scheme, applicable to domestic workers, is likely to give results in the reduction of the number of unemployed at all commensurate with the cost and the serious administrative difficulties involved.65. The class of agricultural workers raises exceptional difficulties. Inasmuch as there is comparatively little unemployment in the industry, the case for extending to it a scheme of this character must depend very largely on the degree to which it would create vacancies for men now endeavouring to obtain employment in other industries. The proportion of agricultural workers over 60 years of age is exceptionally high, and having regard to the generally low level of wages in the industry, it is probable that the offer of a pension of 30/- a week to a married man or 20/- to a single man, conditional upon retirement within a limited period, would be sufficient to induce a large proportion of these men to retire. On such estimates as we are able to make, the persons who may be expected to retire might be as many as 70,000, giving rise to vacancies for roughly 50,000. We are informed that the wholesale removal of this large number of men from the agricultural industry, comprising as it does a high proportion of the most skilled men, could not fail to cause serious dislocation if applied at the same speed that is possible in other industries. Inasmuch as there is comparatively little unemployment in the industry among regular workers and no pool of skilled workers available from which the vacancies could be filled, it would be necessary to train the new recruits. To a considerable extent this would undoubtedly take the form of upgrading of workers with the introduction of youths at the bottom. Under present conditions, a large proportion of the boys in villages drift away to the towns, and directly or indirectly help to swell the ranks of the unemployed, so that even if the vacancies were filled in this way, the general unemployment position would be gradually improved.66. It would probably, however, be desired to make the application of such a scheme to agriculture the means for a more direct relief to the depressed industries by the direct transfer of surplus workers. Replacement by this means would be a slow process, especially as it would necessitate the establishment of centres for adequate training and a considerable addition to the housing accommodation in agricultural districts.67. In view of all these considerations we have felt bound to base our proposals and estimates on the assumption that agricultural workers, like domestic workers, would be excluded from the scheme, which would apply, accordingly, only to the employed population insured for Unemployment Insurance, with the addition of the railway workers.Conditions of Scheme.68. As in previous schemes discussed, the pensions would be, in the case of those under 65 years of age, at the rate of  1 for a single person or 30/- a week for a married man, and for those over the age of 65 at the rates necessary to raise the contributory old age pension to  1 a week or 30/- a week, as the case may be. Similarly, an employed widow iD receipt of a widow&apos;s pension would be entitled to ^xtra 10/- a week.&quot;*0123] i c 2
69. The classes of workers to be eligible for pensions may be briefly summarised as follows : (a.) Persons between the ages of 60 and 65 at the commencement of the Act who on that date (1) had not retired from wage-earning employment; and (2) were insured under the National Health Insurance Acts; and (3) belonged to industries covered for unemployment insurance or were railway workers insured for health insurance purposes. For the purpose of condition (3), the test might be that a person claiming pension must have been in employment in an insured trade under the Unemployment Insurance Act or in the service of a railway company or in receipt of unemployment benefit for a minimum period in the two contribution half-years immediately preceding the date of introduction of the necessary Bill. (This provision.would safeguard the rights of persons wThose absence from work on the appointed day was due to temporary sickness, but would exclude those who had been in receipt of sickness or disablement benefit for a prolonged period, and who might consequently be regarded as permanently disabled, and therefore not available for employment. It would also help to meet the case of persons who had temporarily taken work in an uninsured trade, but could be reasonably regarded as belonging to one of the industries covered.)(b.) Persons over the age of 65 at the commencement of the Act in receipt of contributory old age pensions, and in respect of whom 26 employer&apos;s con-tributions in respect of Unemployment Insurance had been paid in the two contribution half-years immediately preceding the date of introduc-tion of the necessary Bill, and who had not retired from work at the commencement of the Act.70. We appreciate that the conditions proposed for persons over the age of 65 are more severe than for those between the ages of 60 and 65. We feel, however, that conditions of this sort are necessary for persons over the age of 65 if the scheme is not to bring in persons who have already retired from work and Avhose inclusion would not create vacancies for the unemployed, thereby largely increasing the cost without commensurate return.71. If the scheme is to be effective in providing work for men now unemployed, the grant of the pension must be conditional on permanent retirement from work, and the option to take the pension must be limited to a period of, say, six months.72. The question arises whether the person taking the pension should be required to refrain from any form of remunerative work or only from work of an insurable nature.73. To limit the undertaking to insurable employment only might cause resentment among such classes as small shopkeepers and men working on their own account, who would not only see themselves excluded from the scheme, but would find themselves liable to the competition of the retired pensioners a competition which they might fairly represent as subsidised by the State out of general taxation for which they, in common, with all other citizens, were liable. On the other hand, we cannot shut our eyes to the impossibility of exercising any effective supervision over pensioners to check such activities, and without such supervision an under-taking to abstain from work of any kind would simply be a penalty on the honest. We are driven, therefore, to limit the undertaking to employment insurable under the health insurance scheme, in regard to which it might be possible to use the existing machinery for some form of supervision.74. Tf after giving the undertaking the pensioner subsequently undertook work for wages, however short the period, the pension should be permanently forfeited.75. Difficult as it would be to limit the activities of a pensioner, it would be quite impossible to place any restriction as regards working on the wife, and we think, accordingly, that no such restriction should be imposed.76. We see no reason why a pension granted to a single man or widower should be increased if he married subsequently, and we feel that the maximum retirement pension for a married couple should be at the rate of 30/- a week, notwithstanding that both husband and wife might be eligible for retirement pensions.Numbers Affected and Cost.77. Assuming that the scheme would come into effective operation for purposes of payment of pensions on the 1st April, 1930, it is estimated that on that day the
Total     ... ... 677,00078. The actual numbers of persons over 65 in receipt of contributory pensions who have remained in industry, as evidenced by the return of stamped contribution cards, are about 300,000 in the case of men and 55,000 in the case of women. From the statistics as to the numbers of stamps on the cards returned, it is estimated that 20 per cent, would be ineligible for retirement pensions upon the test of 26 contri-butions in the two contribution half-years, and this has been taken into account.79. In framing an estimate of the number of those eligible who would claim retirement penskms, it has been assumed, in the first place, that, as regards persons under 65, all who may be regarded, from a practical point of view, as permanently unemployed would elect to take the pension.80. It is impossible to estimate precisely the number in this category at ages between 60 and 65, but such estimates as can be made lead to a figure of 20,000, all of whom are men.   The number of women in this group is negligible.81. The large majority of those who are eligible are working to a greater or less extent, and their response to the terms offered will largely be determined by their earnings. To frame a trustworthy estimate of the proportions who would accept the pension, it would be necessary in the first place to have information as to the propor-tions of workmen, aged between 60 and 65, earning different amounts of weekly wages. But for no recent date is such information available, either for workmen in the age group in question or for workmen generally. Taking a hypothetical distribution of earnings among workmen aged 60-65, and making reasonable assumptions as to the proportions in each range of earnings which might be expected to be attracted by the offer of the pension, a general average is reached of about one-half of those in employment at the ages under consideration. In the absence of any current data of the numbers of workmen with earnings of different amounts, this figure is advanced as purely hypothetical and subject to a wi.de margin of possible error. A proportion of about 50 per cent, in the case of men, both under and over 65, has been adopted for the purpose of the estimates.82. So far as women are concerned, the offer of a pension of  1 a week must be expected, we are informed, to take the great majority out of industry. Some of the insured women over 60 are, however, the wives of insured men who would retire and take the full pension, and in these cases the wife, not being entitled to a separate pension, would have no inducement to retire. In other cases the wife would have an invalid husband who would not himself be eligible for a pension under the scheme, and in some of these cases the wife might not find the pension to which she was entitled sufficient to induce her to retire. It has, accordingly, been assumed, after considering the relevant data, that the pension would be claimed by 80 per cent, of the eligible insured women of the ages 60-65 and by 87-J per cent, of those over 65.83.   The effect of the above assumptions is shown in the following table : Ages 60-65. Ages over 65.Men. Women. Men. Women.Number eligible for pensions ...    437,000       58,000       170,000       12,000Number taking pensions Permanently   unemployed       20.000Normally working ...    224,000        46,000 90,000        10,000244,000        46,000 90,000        10,000Total Pensioners .Men         ...         ...          ....... 334,000Women     ...          ...          ...          ... 56,000390,000numbers of persons who would satisfy the definitions set out in the previous section would be as follows : Ages.

84. On the above basis, the cost of the retirement pensions, on the assumptior that the scheme is to be limited to those to whom it was applicable at the outset would be as follows : Financial Year.1930-31 1935-3685. The rapid decline in the cost is attributable chiefly to the fact that, as pensioners reached the age of 65 and became entitled to contributory pensions under the Act of 1925, the retirement pension would be reduced to the supplemental addition of 10/- a week, or  1 for a man whose wife was under 65. By 1935 all the pensioners would be in this position.86. In order to form some idea of the extent to which employment for substitutes will be created by the withdrawal of 390,000 pensioners from industry, the first step is to estimate the annual amount of employment of these pensioners, immediately prior to their retirement. The rate of unemployment among insured persons aged over 60 is estimated to be about 50 per cent, above the general rate among all insured persons, and, if the latter be taken as 10 per cent., the corresponding rate for persons over 60 may be taken as 15 per cent. This rate would be applicable to the industrial population over the age of 60. But among the 390,000 persons who, it has been assumed, would claim the . pension, the rate would certainly be higher, for this group includes all the permanently unemployed (20,000) and many others, particularly of the unskilled categories, whose unemployment is above the general average. It is reasonable to assume that the unemployment rates among those who would elect, respectively, to take the pension and to decline it are in the proportion of three to one, and on this basis the deduction from the 390,000 for loss of time due to unemploy-ment is equal to 82,000. There has also to be deducted the loss of time due to sickness, estimated at 7 per cent., and a small allowance for cases of unemployment which have not been registered; these items may be taken to. account for another 30,000, making a total deduction of 112,000 from the 390,000, in order to obtain the effective number of &quot;man-years&quot; of work which the group is performing. The resulting figure is 278,000.87. Now, as regards substitutes, the important thing to discover is the corresponding number of &quot;man-years,&quot; or the number of substitutes who on the average will be given work on any one working day, in consequence of the retirement of the pensioners.88. There are, so far as we know, practically no data on which to base an estimate as to the extent to which substitution will actually take place.89. On the one hand, it is clear that the industrial efficiency of the pensioners taken in the mass is lower than that of workers under the age of 60, and that, therefore, the work done by the pensioners could be done by a smaller number of substitutes, all or most of whom would be under 60. There are no doubt many cases in which workers over 60 are of full efficiency, and not a few in which such a worker is one of the most valuable men on the staff; but we have assumed that workers of this description, who will usually be drawing relatively high wages, will for the most part decide not to take the pension. The chief instances in which really skilled workers would be likely to take the pension are those in agriculture, which is not within this scheme, and possibly railways, where the number is not large enough to affect the broad result. On the whole, therefore, the pensioners, so far as they do not belong to the category of &quot; odd-job &quot; men, such as watchmen, caretakers, &amp;c, will have been engaged in unskilled or partially skilled work where physical strength or fitness is one of the most important factors, and where a smaller number of younger men can do the same total of work. .90. Another consideration which has to be weighed is the extent to which the work done by the pensioner need not be done at all if he retires.91. Some proportion of the &quot;odd-jobs&quot; are undoubtedly created in the sense that the employer deliberately finds a job for someone whom he regards as having some claim upon him or specially wishes to help, e.g., because he was injured at his works, because he is a badly disabled ex-service man, or for some other similar 21,600,000 10,000,000
reason. If such a man retires on a pension the employer will not engage another in his place unless a substitute is at hand with something like the same claim to assistance, and the chance of this happening will be reduced owing to the assumed retirement on pensions of practically all potential substitutes over the age of 60.92. Outside the category of &quot;odd-job&quot; men it is possible also that employers, instead of automatically filling the places of pensioners, may in some cases take the opportunity to reorganise their work so as to make this unnecessary. There will no doubt be a tendency in this direction, in line with the whole trend of present-day industrial organisation. There will be few cases, however (apart perhaps from that of railways), in which the number of pensioners retiring from a particular works will be large enough by itself to afford much scope for reorganisation, and this point may be of importance mainly when the retirement coincides with other opportunities for reducing staff,93. The arguments so far mentioned tend to the view that replacements will not equal retirements. On the other hand, it may be said that, broadly speaking, industry is not conducted on a philanthropic basis, and that, in the main, it may be assumed that if an old man retires his work will have to be done by somebody else. This is a view which, as a general proposition, certainly cannot be demonstrated to be incorrect. But it may be remarked, in the first place, that as regards &quot; odd-job &quot; men, there are certainly cases in which work is &quot; created.&quot; Further, in the case of the ordinary worker engaged in unskilled manual labour, it has been pointed out above that the average efficiency of workers over 60 is less than that of workers under 60, but it is certainly not generally true, for time workers at any rate, that the rates of wages are correspondingly lower.94. It is probably the case that, for a variety of reasons, whether benevolence, traditional practice, trade union influence, or mere inertia, the principle of ruthless scrapping or down-grading of workers as they become less efficient, is a good deal diluted in practice. Employers in general do not discharge their old employees for this reason unless some special occasion arises for doing so, such as a reorganisation of the works or a temporary stoppage, which gives an opportunity for selecting those to be re-engaged. Even in such cases it would be rash to say that some margin of benevolence is not allowed for the claims of the older men. -95. As stated above, the retirements are equivalent approximately to 278,000 &quot;man-years&quot; of employment. In examining the question of replacements, the value to be given to the considerations referred to in paragraphs 87-94 is a matter of exceeding difficulty. Some of us are of opinion that these factors would reduce the figure of 278,000 man-years by not more than 10 per cent., while others of us feel that the non-replacements due to these causes would be very much higher, a figure of 50 per cent, having, indeed, been suggested. For the purposes of our estimates we have adopted the round figure of 200,000 man-years as representing replacements. This would be equivalent to placing about 230,000 persons in work, subject to loss of time through the ordinary contingencies of unemployment and sickness.96. It is, of course, to be noted that in so far as employers are able to dispense with the services of pensioners Without impairment of productive power, or are able to get the work done by a smaller number of substitutes, who receive a smaller total of wages, there will be a saving on the employers&apos; wage-bill.97. If the retirements be as set out in paragraph 83, and assuming the replace-ments to be equivalent to something in the neighbourhood of 200,000 &quot;man-years,&quot; the estimated saving to the Unemployment Fund in the first year would be about  9,000,000. The corresponding relief to local authorities in respect of Boor Law expenditure might be approximately  1,000,000. There would also be some relief to Approved Societies from the cessation of the liability to provide sickness and disablement benefit to retired pensioners between the ages of 60 and 65.98. It will be observed that the cost of the scheme rapidly declines, and on this ground it has been suggested that it should be financed by annual payments from the Exchequer of uniform amount extending over 15 years; the cost after that period (which would then have fallen to an inconsiderable sum), being met year by year as it arose. The equalised annual charge for the 15 years, on a 5 per cent, basis, is estimated to be nearly  11,000,000. Borrowing would be necessary for the first five years, the amount required to be borrowed in the first year being  10,700,000, or approximately one-half of the charge of  21,600,000 arising in that year.
in99. In giving these figures, we must not be held as in any way advocating a plan of this kind. It would, in fact, amount to a reduction of the Sinking Fund in the early years, throwing heavy additional charges on to future years which are already heavily mortgaged under existing pension schemes. The matter is clearly one of general budgetary finance, and hardly within our province.100. We have considered the question whether any serious dislocation would result in industry from the withdrawal of 390,000 persons aged 60 and over, as a result of this scheme.101. It can probably be assumed that the pensioners will be fairly evenly spread over the industrial districts and over the various trades affected. The chief exception is perhaps that of the railways, where we have assumed that a high proportion of the men of 60 and over will retire.102. As regards distribution in time, over the six months to be allowed for making a choice, there will be a considerable group, consisting of those who are earning little or no wages, who will take the pension as early as possible. These drawing relatively high wages who nevertheless take the pension (e.g., railwaymen) will take it as late as possible. But it is perhaps reasonable to suppose that there will be a fair degree of dispersion over the period of six months.103. In small businesses some disturbance might be felt by the withdrawal of pivotal men, but generally such men will be skilled and so will be remunerated on a scale which will tend to disincline them to take advantage of the scheme.104. On the whole we think that, while there would no doubt be instances in which difficulty would arise, no serious amount of dislocation need be feared.- 105. We should, however, point out that the present intention is to raise the school-leaving age to 15 as from April, 1931, thereby withholding from industry in the ensuing twelve months a full year&apos;s supply of &quot;school-leavers&quot; between 14 and 15 numbering between 350,000 and 400,000. If it were proposed that the retirements under the pension scheme should occur in the same period the question of the effect on industry would require further consideration.VI. Scheme D.   Permanent Scheme for Workers over the Age of 60.106. In connection with the purely emergency measure in Section V, we have thought it desirable to obtain estimates of the cost of a permanent scheme of this character, as the view has been expressed in the Committee that the Government might find it necessary, or preferable, to make the scheme permanent. In obtaining these estimates we have taken as a basis that pensions should be available to workers on attaining the age of 60, provided that they exercised their option to retire from work and take the pension within not more than six months after attaining that age.107. It is obviously difficult to express a positive opinion as to what proportion of those who reach the age of 60 would within the ensuing six months elect to retire on this condition. Even in regard to an emergency scheme set up in a period of acute unemployment and offered to workers of all ages from 60 upwards there must, as we have indicated, be much uncertainty upon this point, and the problem is intensified when the changing industrial conditions under which, from time to time, a permanent scheme would operate are brought under consideration. In addition an effort has to be made to visualise the probable reactions to the scheme of individuals attaining the age of 60 in the future. A large proportion of those arriving at this age would still be in full vigour with earning powers undiminished, and it is certainly problematical as to what would be the attitude of these persons to an option to retire, practically at once, upon a pension of an amount involving, generally, a substantial reduction of income or to forgo the opportunity for all time and to rest content with the prospect of drawing the smaller pension under the Act of 1925 at the age of 65, hampered by no conditions as to subsequent employment.108. A scheme, so framed, might create certain dissatisfaction among men who were content to go on working for a time, but were unwilling to take so great a
risk as the refusal to retire at once would involve. On the other hand, a plan which left the option open for several years would in great measure defeat its own ends. Retirement would tend to be postponed in the great majority of cases until the latest possible date, and the scheme would, to this extent, serve merely to augment the pensions provided under the present system to those who were no longer capable of regular work, and whose retirement would create no vacancies additional to those which in the course of nature must inevitably arise. This difficulty could only be avoided by a stipulation that the worker must decide upon his course of action within a very short period after attaining the age at which the pension becomes available. Taking this period to be one of six months, as above suggested, we have framed the estimates of cost on the assumption that 50 per cent, of the insured men reaching 60 after the scheme was instituted would retire. This figure has been arrived at after discussion of the subject with officials of the Ministry of Labour, who, we must add, feel the difficulty of dogmatising on such an elusive point. In the case of insured women, the corresponding figure is taken as 80 per cent. The cost of the pensions to the Exchequer on this basis is estimated to be as follows : The charge would continue to rise for many years with the growth of the population at the ages over 60. No recession in the amount or the burden can be seen within any period to which the estimates might be carried.VII, -Scheme E.   Deferred Permanent Scheme for Workers over theAge of 65.109. It has been suggested that a permanent scheme for persons over the age of 65 might be introduced as a supplementary scheme to Scheme C (the emergency scheme for persons over the age of 60) on the basis that the permanent scheme should commence five years after the date of commencement of Scheme C, when the youngest of the workers eligible for pension under that scheme would have reached the age of 65, and when its annual cost would have fallen to  10,000,000.110. The pension, which would be supplemental to the contributory old age pension, would be conditional upon permanent retirement from work within six months of reaching the age of 65; industrial workers between the ages of 60 and 65 at the inception of Scheme C who had failed to exercise their option to take the pension under that emergency scheme would not, however, be given a further option on the coming into operation of the permanent scheme.111. It would be necessary to impose qualifying conditions somewhat similar to those formulated in connection with Scheme C for workers over the age of 65. The conditions would necessarily be more exacting in view of the necessity of limiting the scheme to persons who had been effectively employed up to the age of 65.112. If the permanent scheme were zestricted to the same classes as those mentioned in paragraph 67, that is, broadly, persons insured under the scheme of National Health Insurance, other than agricultural workers and domestic servants, the estimated cost of the combined schemes would be  11,100,000 in 1935-36 when the permanent scheme would come into operation, and would rise to  16,000,000 in 1941, and to  19,500,000 in 1945-46.113. The adoption of a scheme of this kind would obviously provide the opportunity to bring agriculture within the scope of the system, as the grounds set out in paragraphs 65 and 66 for its exclusion from Scheme C would have far less weight in a scheme for workers over the age of 65 and which is not to come into operation for five years. If agriculture were included, the estimated cost of the combined schemes, beginning at  21.600,000 in 1930-31, would be  13,000,000 in 1935-36,  18,500,000 in 1940-41 and  22,000,000 in 1945-46.In 1930-31 In 1935-36 In 1940-41 In 1945-46 21,600,000 32,000,000 38,000,000 42,000,000

It contains an account of the exhaustive and protracted researches of the Committee, and of the merits of the various schemes to give effect to Party Policy which it has considered.2. The body of the Report makes no recommendation of policy, but the evidence presented, in our view; leads clearly to the conclusion that scheme C should be adopted forthwith as a practical scheme of moderate cost, which would make an early and substantial contribution to the unemployment problem. We recommend it as the scheme best fitted to meet the requirements of our Terms of Reference covering the whole field of retirement pensions as a contribution to the unemployment problem which had already been recommended to the attention and action of Government by our Party Conference, by the Trade Union Congress, and by the Melchett-Turner Conference. The scheme we recommend is an emergency measure designed to meet an abnormal economic situation by the optional retirement of older workers and their replacement on a substantial scale by the younger unemployed.-Details of Scheme Recommended.3. The details of scheme C, which are intricate, but are based on certain definite and defensible principles, can be studied in the Report and need not here be recapitulated. In broad outline it provides a pension of  1 a week for a man and 10/- for his wife for all workers subject to unemployment insurance, plus railwaymen, if they have attained the age of 60 and are willing within a specified period to retire from industry. It is estimated in the Report that 390,000 will accept the pension, and will retire from industry,while, for reasons which we will now state, we estimate the vacancies thus created at not less than 280,000.Replacement of those who have Retired.4. The estimate in the report of the replacement of those who retire is framed in terms of man-years, which indicate the actual reduction in the figures of the live register of unemployment that may be anticipated from the scheme. The term a man-year of employment represents the employment of one man for a whole year, without making any allowance for the factors of intermittent unemployment and sickness, which are incidental to normal employment. Consequently, replace-ment in terms of man-years represents a considerably smaller number of replacements than the actual number of vacancies created and the number of those at present unemployed who will fill these vacancies in normal conditions of employment.In considering the extent to which the 390,000 who retire will be replaced in terms of man-years of employment, we are advised that a deduction of 112,000 must be made in respect of sickness, intermittent unemployment, and total unemployment among those who accept the pension. When this deduction is made we reach a figure of replacement in terms of man-years amounting to 278,000.5. It is further suggested in the report that an additional deduction must be made in respect of two factors : (1) That in the spheres where Trade Union regulations are weak or inoperative, old men are employed at cheaper rates than younger men, and that in the event of their retirement they will consequently be replaced by fewer younger men owing to the higher cost. (2) That for charitable and sentimental reasons employers are employing at standard rates old men who cannot do a full day&apos;s work and whose work will be done after their retirement by a smaller number of younger men.
SECRET.Addendum by the Chairman, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.1. WE were instructed to report on retirement pensions to industrial workers in relation to unemployment, and that report is herewith submitted. It contains an account of the exhaustive and protracted researches of the Committee, and of the merits of the various schemes to give effect to Party Policy which it has considered.2. The body of the Report makes no recommendation of policy, but the evidence presented, in our view-; leads clearly to the conclusion that scheme C should be adopted forthwith as a practical scheme of moderate cost, which would make an early and substantial contribution to the unemployment problem. We recommend it as the scheme best fitted to meet the requirements of our Terms of Reference covering the whole field of retirement pensions as a contribution to the unemployment problem which had already been recommended to the attention and action of Government by our Party Conference, by the Trade Union Congress, and by the Melchett-Turner Conference. The scheme we recommend is an emergency measure designed to meet an abnormal economic situation by the optional retirement of older workers and their replacement on a substantial scale by the younger unemployed.-Details of Scheme Recommended.3. The details of scheme C, which are intricate, but are based on certain definite and defensible principles, can be studied in the Report and need not here be recapitulated. In broad outline it provides a pension of  1 a week for a man and 10/- for his wife for all workers subject to unemployment insurance, plus railwaymen, if they have attained the age of 60 and are willing within a specified period to retire from industry. It is estimated in the Report that 390,000 will accept the pension, and will retire from industry,while, for reasons which we will now state, we estimate the vacancies thus created at not less than 280,000.Replacement of those who have Retired.4. The estimate in the report of the replacement of those who retire is framed in terms of man-years, which indicate the actual reduction in the figures of the live register of unemployment that may be anticipated from the scheme. The term a man-year of employment represents the employment of one man for a whole year, without making any allowance for the factors of intermittent unemployment and sickness, which are incidental to normal employment. Consequently, replace-ment in terms of man-years represents a considerably smaller number of replacements than the actual number of vacancies created and the number of those at present unemployed who will fill these vacancies in normal conditions of employment.In considering the extent to which the 390,000 who retire will be replaced in terms of man-years of employment, we are advised that a deduction of 112,000 must be made in respect of sickness, intermittent unemployment, and total unemployment among those who accept the pension. When this deduction is made we reach a figure of replacement in terms of man-years amounting to 278,000.5. It is further suggested in the report that an additional deduction must be made in respect of two factors : (1) That in the spheres where Trade Union regulations are weak or inoperative, old men are employed at cheaper rates than younger men, and that in the event of their retirement they will consequently be replaced by fewer younger men owing to the higher cost. (2) That for charitable and sentimental reasons employers are employing at standard rates old men who cannot do a full day&apos;s work and whose work will be done after their retirement by a smaller number of younger men.
6. Opinions as to the importance of these factors vary between a deduction of 10 per cent, and 50 per cent, from the replacements in terms of man-years stated aboveThese factors are admittedly the subject of mere opinion, as no data or statistics in regard to them are available.7. For our part we believe the first factor to be unsubstantial, owing to the present strength of Trade Unionism. We also reject the conception that present industry is extensively conducted on the philanthropic and charitable basis which is suggested by the second factor. Further, many such old people lacking full working capacity who accept the pension and retire, are likely in effect to be replaced by an equal number of very young persons under the age of 21. Consequently, we believe that 10 per cent, is the maximum deduction to be made from the estimated replacement in terms of man-years in respect of these two factors. If this view be correct the replacement in terms of man-years would be. in the neighbourhood of 250,000, which represents a replacement in terms of actual vacancies created amounting to more than 280,000.Saving to Industry through Relief of Unremuvierative Charges.8. If the contrary opinion be in fact correct, that industrialists are now employing so many unnecessary old men for purely charitable reasons, an important indirect effect of this scheme will be an increase in the efficiency of industry by relieving it of an unremunerative charge amounting to some millions per annum. For instance, if the deduction from replacement in terms of man-years in respect of the above-mentioned factors be put as high as 28 per cent, (which reduces the total anticipated replacement in terms of man-years to 200,000), and even if the wages of those not replaced on account of these factors average only 35/- a week, the total saving to industry of this unremunerative charge will amount to over seven million a year, although this figure may be discounted to some extent by replacement at a higher wage level. If, on the other hand, our view be correct that a larger measure of replacement will take place, the effects of the scheme in giving employment will be to that extent the greater without any increase in cost.Cost and Results.9. The figures of those accepting the pension are admittedly susceptible to a certain margin of error. A happy feature of this optional scheme, however, here presents itself. The more who accept the pensions the more vacancies will be created; the fewer who accept the pensions the smaller will be the cost. To the extent that the inducement to retire is accepted the unemployment problem is solved. To the extent that it is not accepted relief is afforded to the Exchequer. The cost is in direct relation to the results. It cannot be denied that no other unemployment scheme has ever produced such results in proportion to cost.The results are very great, for at one stroke we reduce by one-third the wholly unemployed. The cost to the Exchequer is  21,600,000 in the first year, falling to  10,000,000 after 5 years, and to the negligible at the end of 15 years. Against this outlay must be set savings to the Nation in the first year of  10,750,000 to the Insurance Fund (upon our assumption that 250,000 replacements in terms of man-years will take place), which would soon restore the Fund to solvency,  1,000,000 to the Poor Law, some slight sum to the Approved Societies, and several millions to industry, through savings on its unremunerative wage bill.The net cost to the nation in the first year amounts to a comparatively small sum if the factor of these savings be taken into account, while the great advantages of a measure which restores the Insurance Fund to solvency can scarcely be overstressed.Averaging or Funding of Cost.10. Further, it is surely legitimate to average the cost of this proposal over the effective life of the scheme. If this course be adopted the cost to the Exchequer will only amount to  11,000,000 per annum for fifteen years. Borrowing, even in the first years, will be unnecessary if the rapidly diminishing cost of this proposal can be balanced against other national charges, which are increasing over the same
period of time. It is difficult to see what objection could be taken to such a very normal budgetary transaction. More doubtful ground, but worthy of consideration, is the possibility of funding tlie charge of the pensions scheme for the same thirty-year period, over which the Unemployment Grants Committee now funds its charges. Under that Committee we are spending each year on unemployment money raised by loan which is repaid over thirty years. The present unemployment crisis is, in fact, largely financed by the future. An analogous method might be adopted in regard to the pensions scheme. If the expedient of funding be employed, the annual charge to the Exchequer would be further substantially reduced. These, however, are matters for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We will content ourselves with pointing out the favourable comparison of the cost of the present scheme with other unemployment schemes, upon the least advantageous assumption that the maximum cost is borne in the first year and that neither averaging nor funding is adopted.Cost of Providing Employment per Man tinder Retirement Pensions Scheme compared tvith Cost of Employment per Man under Works Schemes.11. The net cost to public funds in the first year of putting men to work as a result of the suggested pensions scheme is  35 per man (if 250,000 replacements take place in terms of man-years*). This figure should be compared with the present net cost to public funds of  200 ( 250 less savings of  50) per man per year of setting men to work under the various unemployment schemes of the Government. The latter figure is based on the current assumption that 4,000 men are employed directly and indirectly for a year per every  1,000,000 spent.12. The retiring pension scheme here suggested is, in fact, by far the cheapest means yet devised of setting the unemployed to work. It can, of course, be contended that under the works scheme of the Government a permanent asset is created, even at a larger financial outlay, although it is often argued that some of the work may be of doubtful economic utility.Provides Genuine Employment in Permanent Occupation.13. A more substantial, and indeed, an overwhelming argument in our view-is that men set to work as a result of the pensions scheme will be employed, not in temporary and artificial occupations outside their own trades, but in permanent occupation within normal industry. Here resides the real- problem to which the present Government has addressed itself. How are we to secure normal employment for the thousands of young men and women now losing their skill in enforced idleness and suffering the ever-increasing demoralisation of unemployment, which in the end robs many of their ability to work ? Many of them coming from skilled trades are unsuited to the rough work of the unemployment schemes. Employment in such tasks may ruin their skilled capacities, and in any case does not give them the moral satisfaction they derive from a genuine job in their own trade which employs their acquired skill. We do not for a moment urge any relaxation of work schemes; on the contrary, we have suggested in other memoranda that far more could be done in the speeding up of such schemes than has yet been done. Nevertheless, there is clearly a limit to the efficacy of such schemes while large classes of the unemployed exist for which they cannot cater at all.14. The only hope for the skilled unemployed worker is absorption in normal industry, which can only immediately be achieved by the retiring pension scheme we here advance. It holds.the field as the only scheme advanced by any Party, or from any quarter, which not only provides employment for skilled workers, but deals with the general problem on a scale never before attempted.The Emergency Measure to Deal with Unemployment in Relation to the General Pension Position.15. It is submitted as an emergency plan to deal rapidly with the unemploy-ment problem, and is in no sense suggested as a measure to deal permanently with the question of Old Age Pensions. That question, together with other pension and insurance questions, is now being considered by another Committee of the Cabinet, ,* If only 200,000 replacements in terms of man-years take place the cost to public funds of putting-men to work in the first year will be t&apos;50 per man.
and a strong case exists for such general pension and insurance questions being thus dealt with as a whole and apart from the immediate unemployment problem.16. Our present researches, however, have shed some light on the general question, and we venture to express the hope that the Government will consider the consolidation of existing insurance, pension and compensation systems. We believe that they might be combined in an &quot;all-in&quot; insurance system that, without any additional contributions from the workers or from industry, would provide permanent benefits on a scale far beyond the limits of present resources.17. These considerations fall clearly within the purview of the Cabinet Committee which is considering the general question of insurance and pensions. Nevertheless, subject to the researches and recommendations of this Committee, we desire to add to our recommendation of scheme &quot;C &quot; as an emergency measure to deal with present unemployment the further suggestion that a permanent scheme &quot; E &quot; at the age of 65, conditional on retirement, should be adopted on the same financial terms of  1 a week for a worker who, on attaining the age of 65, is willing within a specified period to retire, and of 10/- a week in respect of his wife if he is married.18. The estimated cost of the combined schemes would be  11,000,000 in 1935-36, when the permanent scheme would come into operation, and would , rise to  16,000,000 in 1940-41, and to  19,500,000 in 1945-46. It has, of course, to be noted that in the event of the emergency scheme being adopted no charge in respect of the suggested permanent scheme will be incurred at all during the next five years.It is further to be observed from the report that the difficulties of dislocation, housing accommodation, &amp;c, which preclude Agriculture from the emergency scheme, do not arise in the same way in connection with the permanent scheme. If Agriculture was included in the permanent scheme, the cost of the combined schemes would be  13,000,000 in 1935-36,  18,500,000 in 1940-41, and  22,000,000 in 1945-46, so the extra cost of including Agriculture in the first year of the permanent scheme would only be  1,900,000, rising to  2,500,000 in 1945-46. We therefore recommend that at the end of five years the scheme should include Agriculture, and should be put on a permanent basis at the age of 65, which would be applicable to the more normal conditions of the future, which are likely to differ widely from the conditions of the present emergency, to meet which we suggest the emergency scheme of retirement at the age of 60.POSSIBLE  OBJECTIONS  TO  THE  SCHEME  AND  THEIR  ANSWER.19. Many objections will, of course, be urged against any scheme which attempts to deal drastically with unemployment, and against any pensions scheme in particular. We submit that such objections should not deter the Government from achieving at so small a cost such great results as those presented by scheme &quot; C &quot; unless they can be shown to render this scheme impracticable, which is proved by the report to be in no way the case.The Argument that all such Schemes Increase the Cost of Production.20. We anticipate the familiar argument that any scheme financed by the Exchequer which attempts to deal with unemployment or any subject of social reform will in fact increase the cost of production, and will consequently reduce the competitive power of British industry and its capacity to provide employment.The Labour Party&apos;s consistent rejection of this general economic opinion has of recent years been strongly reinforced by both the majority and minority reports of the Colwyn Committee. In addition, it can be shown clearly from statistics appearing in the Report that this argument has no force whatever in relation to the Retirement Pension Scheme C.The cost of this scheme to the Exchequer in the first year is estimated in the Report at  21,600,000, but the Report also estimates that a saving will result of
 9,000,000 to the Unemployment Insurance Fund* and  1,000,000 to the Poor Law. In addition, it is estimated that a further saving will inure in respect of the wages of old men who are not replaced. We have shown earlier that if the wages of these men average only 35/- a week the saving in this regard will exceed  7,000,000. Thus savings to the Nation of over  17,000,000 can be set against a cost to the Exchequer of  21,600,000. Are we seriously to believe that the cost of production would be materially increased by a nett charge of a little over  4,000,000 ? But the argument does&quot;not end here. It can even be contended that the costs of production will actually be reduced by the Retirement Pensions scheme for the reason that the saving arises anterior to the costing of the product, while the charge arises posterior to the costing of the product. Wages, Rates, the contributions of industry to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, are in the nature of overhead charges, and are considered in the costing of the article which industry produces. On the other hand, charges incurred by the Exchequer are met by Taxation, which generally is levied upon profits after the process of production is complete.These considerations were made familiar by the exhaustive examination and detailed recommendations of the Colwyn Committee, and are now embodied in a theory of fiscal policy largely accepted by all Parties. For instance, this theory was certainly implemented in the Conservative De-Rating Bill, which confirmed the principle so long advanced by the Labour Party that Rates are a more onerous charge upon industry than the Taxation by which those Rates were relieved. If this conception has any. validity, the proposed Retirement Pensions scheme will beneficially affect the cost of production because its operation will save industry from considerable overhead charges which fall in the same categorjr as Rates and will transfer those charges to general taxation. :The General Fear of Unsound Extensions of the Scheme.21. The fear has been expressed during the deliberations of the Committee that the adoption of a scheme of this nature may lead to widespread demands for the extension of the scheme to classes now excluded, and also for the develop-ment of other schemes which may be in themselves unsound, or are beyond the capacity of the Nation to support.We are not greatly concerned. to deal with arguments which are really irrelevant to the scheme we submit and are based, in fact, on the general fear that any step in social reform may lead to other steps at a later stage. Such arguments can always be urged against action of any kind and, if accepted, lead to the complete paralysis of Government. Naturally, one step by a Government leads to a demand for other steps in directions both good and bad. In such demands and in such a process is written the whole history of progress. It is the function of Government to adopt proposals which are at the time reasonable and practicable and to resist those which are not. The resistance of a Government to unreasonable demands should not be prejudiced by action on such well-defined principles as those on which the present scheme is based. If the Government decides to resist demands for the immediate extension of this scheme, it should be fortified by two clear tests for application to all demands for extension :  (1.) Will the proposed extension, if accepted, create immediately more vacancies in industry which can be filled ? and (2.) Will the proposed extension, if accepted, create difficulties of dislocation-tion, &amp;c, wiiiali are not incidental to the present scheme ?22. The Government, in fact, can rest upon the decision that this proposal is an emergency measure to deal with unemployment, and that all suggestions which weaken this purpose must be resisted. Such a decision can be defended on clear principle, both in the House of Commons and in the country.Those who have already Retired and who will attain the Age of 60 in ftiture.23. This test can be applied successfully to the anticipated demand for the same pension from those who have already retired from industry. To include them within the scheme would clearly defeat its purpose, for their acceptance of the* Paragraph 9 of this Addendum estimates a larger saving of  10,750,000 to the Unemployment Insurance Fund on account of the larger measure of replacement estimated in paragraph 7 of this Addendum.
pension would create no vacancies in industry, while it would greatly increase the cost of the scheme. In the same way, a demand from those who will attain a specified age in the future can be resisted, if it be desired to resist it, on the grounds that their inclusion would abolish the emergency nature of the scheme for dealing with present unemployment and would change it into a permanent pensions scheme.24. It can indeed be argued with force that a permanent pension system for the country cannot be devised in relation to a purely emergency situation. There are no grounds for assuming there are certainly no grounds on which the Party in power should assume that the present unemployment emergency is a permanent factor in national life. It can be held that it is a mistake to build a permanent pension system on the assumption that present unemployment and general conditions are permanent, and that to do so would be an unwarrantable admission in advance of the failure of the Labour Government. Consequently, demands that the present scheme should be made permanent can be resisted, if it be desired to resist them, on the grounds that such extension would defeat the whole purpose and character of an emergency scheme.25. The same tests can be applied effectively to such classes as the shopkeepers, whose inclusion would in no way affect industrial unemployment, and who, in fact, have never yet been included, even in general pensions schemes designed purely on grounds of social reform and in no way limited to a purpose so specific as dealing with the unemployment problem. The second test concerning dislocation can meet any demand from Agriculture for inclusion in the Emergency Scheme C, with which we will deal at a later stage.26. Some dissatisfaction among those excluded is, of course, incidental to any pension scheme. A line must be drawn somewhere, and those outside will always cherish some sense of grievance. In the case of this scheme, such grievances will have less support in justice and in public opinion than is customary in most pension schemes, because the present proposal is limited to the specific purpose of dealing with unemployment, and public opinion very strongly supports that purpose. The Nation will understand that to include in the scheme large classes of people whose acceptance of a pension would clearly create no vacancies in industry would be to defeat the purpose of an unemployment scheme by piling up the costs without increasing the results.The Charge of Favouritism.27. A further argument may be adduced that by this measure certain workers are benefited from the Exchequer by money raised in taxation from the whole community.This argument applies to almost any scheme of social reform. It applies to State assistance of decent housing for some workers to which other unassisted slum dwellers contribute by taxation. It applies to the present Unemployment schemes, which benefit a few selected unemployed workers by providing them with work, but are financed from the taxation of the whole community. It certainly applies with far more force to the policy adopted by the Blackpool Conference to extend retirement pensions at 60 to the miners alone.A strong case is presented by arguments that appear in the report to show that such differentiation would be impracticable in definition and would be exceedingly difficult to defend in equity.28. The argument that a particular section of the workers are to receive favoured treatment is met more effectively by the present scheme than in most analogous cases, because it deals in a very comprehensive way with the unemploy-ment problem, which the whole Nation strongly desires to see resolved; while its effects enter every district, and make their influence felt in nearly every working-class home in the land.The Conclusive Answer to those Excluded.29. On the above grounds the scheme might be defended on its own merits as an emergency contribution to the unemployment problem, but we do not rest our case on this argument.    The real  and  conclusive  answer  resides in  the  further
recommendations we have already made. We have already urged the Government to consider and to initiate legislation revising the whole pension and insurance system. Such a recommendation is pushing an open door, for the Government has already begun such inquiry. We have coupled with this recommendation the further suggestion that the present emergency scheme should be made permanent upon a 65 years of age basis, which would, in fact, mean a permanent scheme at the end of another five years if the present emergency scheme be now adopted.Difficulties of Supervision and Demarcation.30. Certain difficulties of supervision and demarcation arise which, in our opinion, can be greatly overstressed, and are far from insuperable.As set out in the report, the scheme is limited to men and women who (1) Are over 60 years of age on a given date; (2) Belong to certain insured industries;(3) Can be regarded as effective competitors in the labour market; and (4) Would retire therefrom completely and finally within a limited period.The first difficulty to consider is the enforcement of the necessary ban on any wage-earning occupation in respect of those who accept the pension, without which the purpose of the scheme is defeated.Machinery already exists for the purpose of enforcing this condition in the present mechanism of Health Insurance, but, apart from Government machinery, an extremely effective instrument can be found for this purpose in the activity of public opinion. Pensioners will for the most part be well-known in the district in which they reside. It will be common knowledge that they are receiving pensions from the State on the condition that they retire from employment and create vacancies in industry. Public opinion urgently desires to see the unemployment problem solved, and may be relied upon to co-operate both by social pressure and by the supply of information to see that such a measure is not defeated. Already, a considerable agitation exists against the employment of pensioners, such as. ex-policemen. That opinion will be considerably stronger in preventing the evasion of a Retirement Pension scheme designed specially to provide vacancies in industry. It will be virtually impossible for a man known as a pensioner to carry on any wage-earning occupation, and the severe penalty of loss of pension occasioned by detection should be an additional and effective deterrent.31. Fine definitions in the sphere of demarcation will inevitably arise. For example, domestic servants employed at hotels or lodging houses are insurable,. while those employed in private houses are not insurable. The permanent staffs of local authorities are in general not insured, but some are, the difference resting mainly on the choice of the authority. Some tramwaymen are insured; others are not; while, in general, employees of omnibus companies are insured.It must, however, be remembered that the necessity for these definitions arises under the present Insurance Law. No fresh administrative difficulty is added by the present scheme in this respect because the basis of the scheme is already defined in Law. The only question on the subject of demarcation here arising is the extra sense of grievance which may be created in certain cases narrowly excluded. We have admitted above that some sense of grievance in such cases is inevitable in any such scheme as that suggested. But the cases likely to arise in this connection will be relatively few in number, and from the administrative standpoint no fresh difficulty is created as they are covered by the existing machinery of legal definition.The Case of A griculture.3.2. A more serious objection rests in the case that the emergency scheme is confined to workers engaged in occupations subject to unemployment insurance, plus the railwaymen. The inclusion of railwaymen is easily defensible on the grounds that the consideration which led to their exclusion from the general unemployment insurance scheme are irrelevant to the present issue. Their situation for present purposes is analogous to the workers who fall under the unemployment insurance Act. More serious is the exclusion of Agriculture. This industry was not included because it presented features which do not arise in other industries.
In this sphere alone we are satisfied, on the advice of the Ministry, that a considerable danger of dislocation from a serious shortage of labour might arise. That danger cannot be obviated if the scheme is&apos; applied to Agriculture as rapidly as we recommend its application to other industries.Nevertheless, we recommend that the Government should announce its consideration of the extension of the scheme to Agriculture, and should inquire immediately into this possibility together with the question of bringing Agriculture within the scope of unemployment insurance. We see no reason why, with longer notice and preparation, this scheme should not embrace agriculture; indeed, we think it highly desirable. With due notice surplus miners, &amp;c, could receive training for agriculture, and a rural housing scheme to meet the influx could be advanced. Nothing could be more desirable from every aspect than the gradual infiltration of the agricultural industry by miners and other surplus workers when genuine vacancies in the industry have been created after preparation over a reasonable period of time. Such a step would admittedly require further consideration, but we see no reason why the Government should not at once announce their inquiry into the subject.We have already definitely recommended that at the end of five years the scheme should be made permanent on a 65 years of age basis and should include Agriculture. Such a lapse of time would afford more than sufficient opportunity for any measures of reorganisation that may be required.The Charge that Unemployment is not really Resolved.33. One last objection which our opponents are likely to adduce remains to be answered. We anticipate the argument that we are not really solving the unemployment problem, but are merely changing the class of worker who is main-tained in unemployment. This argument is not formidable for us to meet, as this measure was in the forefront of our programme for dealing with unemployment, and was approved as a legitimate unemployment measure by our supporters. But even if this anticipated argument was valid, the case for the Retirements Pensions Scheme remains perfectly sound. If, pending national reconstruction, some workers have to be maintained in idleness, who are best fitted to be thus maintained should it be the young or the old ? A man of 60 who has worked all his life will not suffer much demoralisation through living in idleness, but a man of 20 may suffer irreparable harm. By keeping the young in idleness we destroy the human material upon which the future prosperity of reconstructed industry must be built. For years to come we are damaging national efficiency, and our first consideration must be to stop this terrible waste. Idleness may be a boon to the old, but it is a damnation to the young. By this measure we are obeying both the dictates of nature and of economics, and can immediately arrest the corruption and destruction of youth.Conclusion.34. We have endeavoured to show that objections to the scheme create no administrative difficulties which cannot be overcome by the existing machinery of Government. Indeed, more serious difficulties of administration are continually surmounted by that very efficient machinery. The main objections do not, in fact, rest on administrative grounds, but rather on the grounds common to all such schemes that a sense of grievance may be felt among classes excluded from the scope of the measure.35. We submit, however, that on these grounds the present scheme is stronger than any other Pension measure which has been submitted to the country. It cannot be emphasised too often that it is an emergency scheme designed for the purpose of dealing with unemployment and for that purpose alone. It rests on certain clear principles which can be defended successfully before the House of Commons and the country. The anomalies and grievances which it creates are far less, for example, than those created even by the last Amendment to the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Pensions Act, while the ad hoc character of the scheme makes the answer to such cases as it is necessary to resist far stronger and more conclusive.36. The measure gives pensions to 390,000 aged people and creates some 280,000 vacancies for the employment of younger people. Against this advantage to so many is set the sense of grievance which some quarters envisage in regard to certain
classes whose inclusion would defeat the purpose of the scheme. Far above and beyond any such consideration is the benefit to the national interest and the strong support for the whole Nation, which must be evoked by a scheme that for the first time in nine years goes to the heart of the unemployment problem. At one stroke this plan reduces by about one-third the number of the wholly unemployed. It does so at a quarter or less of the cost per man employed of any other scheme for the provision of work considered by the present or by any other Government. It is for those who object to show what other scheme can produce results so great within the same period of time and at a cost at all comparable. Such suggestions have not yet been brought to our notice from any quarter. We therefore earnestly recommend the Government to adopt immediately the suggested Retirement Pensions scheme. We also recommend that it be passed into law at the earliest possible moment. Apart from the fact that a measure dealing so thoroughly with unemployment has strong claim to precedence over all other measures, this recommendation is reinforced by the consideration that the raising of the School age occurs in April 1931, and it is highly desirable on administrative grounds that the operation of the Retirement Pensions scheme should be as far as possible anterior to the further operation of removing the young from industrial)^. In addition, a strong demand exists at the present time, with which we must all sympathise, for the raising of unemployment benefits. In answer to that demand this measure can be truly represented as providing not only defensible maintenance for 390,000 of the working population whose places are taken by the unemployed, but also as relieving to the extent of many millions the burden on the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and proportionately relieving the Exchequers liability in that regard.37. The suggested measure has, in fact, a manifold bearing on the present economic and political situation Avhich makes its immediate application extremely urgent. No one can deny the gravity in terms economic and human of the present unemployment situation. No one from any quarter can suggest any other remedy which deals so rapidly and effectively with that situation.38. In submitting what we believe to be the most potent instrument yet devised for meeting the unemployment problem we desire to express our warmest thanks and appreciation of the work done by our Civil Service colleagues, whose unstinting labours and trained abilities have made possible the production of a practical measure to combat the greatest evil that afflicts the Nation.(Signed)GEORGE LANSBURY.

SECRET.Addendum by the Members of the Sub-Committee other than the ministerial Members.1. UNDER our terms of reference we are directed to enquire into and report upon retirement pensions to industrial workers in relation to employment. We have in the foregoing report explored five typical examples of the many schemes of retirement pensions that could be devised.General Unemployment Considerations.2. Before proceeding to comment on these schemes in detail, we think that it will be convenient to consider the employment aspects of such schemes generally.3. It has been pointed out on many occasions that the present unemployment in this country occurs in the main in those industries which are exposed to foreign competition. There are no sufficient grounds for adopting the pessimistic view that there is a permanent surplus of working population in the country. There may be a surplus of workers in certain industries owing to a slackening in the world demand for their products, but there is ample scope for expansion of other industries provided that a suitable level of costs of production can be reached. It has been generally agreed, therefore, that the only permanent solution of the unemployment problem is to be found in the steady improvement of the competitive power of our industries and in the transfer of workers from those industries in which this process presents the greatest difficulty to industries with greater possibilities of expansion.4. This diagnosis of the position requires that care should be taken in initiating schemes of work to select only such as will improve the economic equipment of the country, schemes which will bring in little or no return for many years being ruled out as a waste of the limited resources of the nation. Thus, not only is immediate employment provided, but the ability of industry to compete in the markets of the world is improved.Retirement Pension Schemes and Unemployment.5. In both respects retirement pension schemes present a marked contrast with works of economic development. No such scheme would make any addition to the sum total of employment in the country. As regards those in employment, it would merely substitute one set of workers for another. As regards those out of employ-ment, it would substitute one group of State pensioners with a permanent right to their pensions and debarred from making any contribution to the national wealth for another group whose rights, in the form of unemployment benefit, were conditional and temporary.6. In so far as it led to some reduction in wage bills from the substitution of what is assumed to be more efficient labour for that of the older men who retire, there -vould be definite advantage to industry, but any such saving would be outweighed by the increased burden which must necessarily be placed upon industry in order to finance the scheme. On balance, therefore, any such scheme would tend to increase the costs of production, to reduce employment and to hinder the recovery of industry.7. Schemes of retirement pensions, especially those of a permanent character, may also have important bearings on the future prosperity of the country by reason of the contraction which they would cause in the working population, on which, of course, the annual production of wealth depends. Such a consideration may seem a little remote at the present time, with an unemployment &quot; live register &quot; of 1,250,000, but in reality the margin of labour available for a revival of industry is much less than this. The enormous number of changes in employment that are continually taking place and the variations in the demands of industry from time to time and from place to place make it difficult, even under the best trade conditions, to avoid
short spells of unemployment for even the efficient workers, while in any aggregate of this kind there must also be a margin of workers who are verging on the unemployable for reasons of age or physical or mental incapacity.8. In this connection account must also be taken of the prospective reduction of the number of young persons entering industry owing to the heavy falling off in the birth rate and to the proposed raising of the school age in 1931.9. The cogency of the foregoing considerations in regard to any scheme of retirement pensions obviously depends on the amount and duration of the burden to be thrown on industry and on the extent and duration of the contraction in the man power of the nation in relation to the future demands of industry. They therefore have the greater weight the wider the scheme and the longer its duration. In the case of a purely temporary scheme, limited to workers above the age of 60 or 65 at a given date, any contraction of man power resulting from the scheme will have been substantially made good in about 10 years, and by the end of that period the burden of the scheme will also have become inconsiderable, but this would not be true of a permanent scheme.The Schemes Examined.11. The main body of the Report sets out, in greater or less detail, five schemes of retirement pensions, three (A, D and E) being of a permanent character, and two (B and C) embracing only persons in selected industries who are over a given age at a particular date. If it be assumed that the present unemployment emergency is not a permanent factor in the national life, there can be no case, purely on the ground of employment, for any but a temporary scheme. As is stated in the Report, Scheme B is regarded as impracticable both from the point of view of the selection of industries to which it is to be applied, and also from the standpoint of the accurate demarcation of the particular industries.Temporary Scheme C.12. We feel, however, that important considerations of practicability also arise under Scheme C. We have estimated that the number of persons who would take . the pension would be 390,000, and have assumed that these retirements would create vacancies for 230,000 persons, subject to the risks of unemployment and sickness, representing an average number of 200,000 persons in work and mostly taken off the live register. These estimates are very conjectural, there being little information available on which they can be based, but we are satisfied that if the scheme could be applied in its integrity the number would, at any rate, be substantial.13. The estimated results in regard to replacement and cost would, however, be secured only by imposing rigorous conditions limiting the classes of beneficiaries. As set out above the scheme is limited to men and women, who(1) are over 60 years of age on a given date; (2) belong to certain insured industries;(3) can be regarded as effective competitors in the labour market; and (4) would retire therefrom completely and finally, within a short limited period.14. Everyone of these conditions raises its own difficulties. One of the most troublesome conditions to enforce would undoubtedly ,be the ban on any form of wage-earning employment. Hitherto, all pensioners, public as well as private, have been free to take up any employment other than the one for which their pension has been granted. The introduction of an absolute veto on all wage-earning employ -ment would lead to much dissatisfaction, for it would have the result that if a man were caught doing one day&apos;s work of this kind his pension under this scheme would be stopped for life.15. One may agree that such a penalty would seem to be a severe one for odd days of employment, and yet if these were allowed the task of checking evasion of the essential condition that the recipient of a retirement pension should, in fact, have retired permanently from employment, difficult enough under the narrowest conditions, -would become well-nigh impossible. In enforcing the condition the Government would have to trust to a considerable extent to the co-operation of the
general public by means of social pressure and unofficial information as to cases in which a man or woman was known to be receiving a pension and to be working for wages. It is certain, however, that without systematic inspection by an official staff this would not be sufficient. Any effective system of supervision with so heavy a penalty in the background is bound to be regarded as oppressive, and the fact that we have not felt it possible to make the condition extend to all profitable employment would lend paint to accusations of harshness.16. If it were attempted to overcome the difficulty by providing a penalty less than forfeiture, on occasional work, new difficulties would arise. Legal enforcement by a penalty such as a fine would be represented as, and would in fact amount to a prohibition of work however willing and able the individual might be to assist an employer in emergency, and thus to contribute to the prosperity and well-being of the community. Suspension of the pension during periods of employment would, on the other hand, convert it into a form of unemployment benefit to be drawn by a favoured class.17. Again, for those within the favoured categories who do not elect to take the pension within the prescribed period, it might be difficult to maintain against all pressure the complete finality of the decision made during the short period when the choice was open. There would be many cases increasing in number as time goes on where through illiteracy, wrong information, general misunderstanding, and unexpected change in the claimant&apos;s circumstances, as, for example, the loss of employment, a strong plea would be made for a further opportunity to take the pension. But the whole success of the scheme in inducing men and women to retire would rest upon the finality of their decision. A man who took the pension during this period would sacrifice wages in order to obtain an assured income for life, and it would be grossly unfair to all who had made the sacrifice to admit these late applicants, however pathetic their plea.18. A number of difficulties centre round the proposed limitation of the scheme to persons belonging to industries insured for the purposes of unemployment insurance, with the addition of railway workers. The fixing of the border line between those insurable against unemployment and those not so insurable is not a simple matter, some thousand decisions a year on specific cases being still required to define it. For example, domestic servants employed at hotels-and lodging houses are insurable, while those employed in private houses are not insurable. The permanent staffs of local authorities are in general not insured, but some are, the difference resting mainly on the choice of the authority. Some tramwaymen are insured, others are not; while in general, employees of omnibus companies are insured.19. These fine distinctions are only necessary at the present time to determine liability for the payment of contributions, and, although the right to unemployment benefit at a later date may turn on the decision, in practice little grievance is caused by decisions excluding a man from insurance and relieving him from the immediate charge of paying contributions. But when the right to a pension for life without any contribution whatever turns on those distinctions many of the decisions which have been made will be called in question, not only on grounds of equity, but also because their results are inconsistent with the avowed object of the scheme to create vacancies for younger people.20. Beyond this fringe of border-line cases lie the large classes of agricultural and domestic workers who will claim that their life&apos;s work is equally deserving of State recognition. The mere association of the qualifying conditions with health insurance would lead them to think that the payment of health insurance contribu-tions itself conferred a right to the pension, especially as it was by virtue of this insurance that they were brought within the scope of the contributory pensions scheme.21. On the broader ground of the equitable distribution of State benefits, the small shopkeepers and workers on their own account, who are now outside the scheme of the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act, would resent their exclusion, and, as already explained, their grievance would be the greater, first, because the pensions are &quot;to be non-contributory, and, secondly, because the conditions under which they are awarded would leave these classes exposed to the competition of the retired pensioner subsidised out of general taxation of which they have to pay their share.
22. Perhaps the most serious of all such difficulties would arise in limiting the scheme to those members of the selected industries who complied with its conditions at a specific date, to the exclusion of all who had retired before that day and all who would subsequently reach the qualifying age. It is estimated that in 1928 some 80,000 workers over 65 years of age took advantage of the new old age pensions under the Act of 1925 to retire. It is asserted that in some cases the retirement was forced upon them by their employers. These persons.will see their neighbours who remained a little longer in industry pensioned off with 30/- a week instead of the 20/- they are receiving. And the men and women who reach the age of 60 in every year during which the scheme is running will have the same grievance.23. In both cases the answer can only be that the scheme is strictly limited in time to achieve an immediate reduction in the number of unemployed, but the difficulty of meeting complaints arising from obvious inequality of individual treatment by arguments from general principles, needs no emphasis.Combination of Schemes C and E.24. In view of these inevitable reactions to the proposals we feel that it is our duty to call attention to the risk that a scheme of the character indicated above, though introduced into Parliament with all the restrictions suggested, might emerge from the fire of public criticism in a very different form. Concessions might not have to be made at the outset on all the points indicated above, but such as were not met would tend to remain as foci of public agitation as long as this large body of favoured pensioners survived.25. In this connection we have given careful consideration to the suggestion in &quot;Section VII of the Report that Scheme E (i.e., a permanent scheme for retirement pensions to persons over the age of 65) might be introduced as a supplementary scheme to Scheme C to come into force five years hence.Scheme E.26. Such a scheme would be open to the general objections to any permanent scheme of retirement pensions set out in the foregoing paragraphs, and to the particular objections enumerated in connection with Scheme C due to its limitation to selected classes. While the difficulty inherent in the temporary scheme that it would benefit only those who were within a selected age group at the outset would be mitigated, it would certainly not be wholly removed. There is reason to fear that, with the pension age fixed at 60 at the outset, a general belief that pensions were ^available to all who chose to retire at the age of 60 might be implanted in the industrial population, and the discovery that those who arrived at 60 after the appointed day and would have to wait till 65, and, incidentally, be subjected in the meantime to the risks of unemployment in an industrial situation which might still be serious, could not but give rise to widespread discontent.27. So far as the cost of this particular scheme is concerned, the estimates, inclusive of agriculture, must clearly be adopted. As is pointed out in paragraph 113 of the Report, the grounds urged therein for the exclusion of this industry from Scheme C would cease to be of great weight under a permanent scheme beginning at 65 more than 5 years hence. The inclusion of agriculture in the scheme would, however, reinforce any demand which otherwise might be made for the extension of the scheme to domestic workers, and the addition of this class would increase the figures of cost given in paragraph 113 of the Report, as well as adding greatly, on balance, to the difficulties of administering the scheme.28. From the point of view of the taxpayer, perhaps the most serious feature of scheme E is the addition it would make to the pension charge in respect of persons whose retirement could not be claimed as resulting from it. It has been estimated, as shown above, that when (in 1928) the old age pensions under the Act of 1925 enured, some 80,000 persons left employment, either voluntarily or under the pressure of employers, and there can be no doubt that this is a permanent concomitant of the contributory scheme, under which  1 a week is available for a married couple when both are over the age of 65.  In all cases where such a pension
would induce retirement the grant of a supplemental 10/- a week with retirement as a condition would produce no new vacancies to set against the expenditure of public money which it would involve.29. It should be noted that one of the effects of the Scheme is that persons who retire before 65 would not be eligible for the increased pension. This might well be regarded as an indefensible anomaly. If, however, a scheme on the lines suggested was put into^operation the effect might be to induce many workers to struggle on in industry until 65 possibly at a reduced wage, or even with collusion of employers in nominal employment in order to qualify for the retirement pension.Unconditional Permanent Scheme of Pensions.30. Even if this permanent scheme (E) were coupled with the emergency scheme (C), there would, in our view, still remain a serious risk that such difficulties of administration would develop in a few years as to lead to the abandonment of the retirement condition and to the grant of unconditional pensions to all persons of 60 years and over. If this were to happen, the result would be that, even if it were found possible to limit such a scheme to persons in the insurable categories, the additional burden on the State resulting from it would, it is estimated, rise at once to  65,000,000 per annum, and grow to  85,000,000 in less than twenty years.31. In considering the ability of the nation to shoulder such a burden, it is relevant to refer again to the tendencies at work altering the age distribution of the population already alluded to in paragraphs 32 to 34 of the Report. The figures there given showed that at the present time there are 4-43 men of working ages (say, 16 to 65) for every old person over 65. Were the normal retiring age reduced to 60 this figure Avould become 2-65 for 1929, and by 1980 it would have fallen to 1-66.   The relative statistics are shown in the footnote below.*32. Thus, in the absence of any marked change in the distribution of labour between the sexes, under a general scheme of retirement on pension at 60 years of age, every five males between 16 and 60 in 1980 would be required not only to earn their own living and to provide for their wives and children, but also to support between them 3 old persons in addition to meeting their share of every other public burden.Great Britain.*Year.Male copulation, 16-60.Total Population aged 60 and over.1929 1960 198013,070,000 14,660,000 14,050,0004,940,000 7,560,000 8,440,000(Signed)A.

Annexure to Report.THE EFFECT ON THE RETIREMENT PENSIONS ESTIMATES OE THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEW UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL.Memorandum by Sir Alfred W. Watson.THE attached Memorandum by the Government Actuary was received after the Chairman hacC on the ground of urgency, given instructions for the final printing and circulation of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report. It was, therefore, not possible to amend the figures relating to the several schemes. It will be appreciated that the Report does not in any way take into account the proposals relating to unemployment insurance embodied in the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill, 1929, now before Parliament.(Signed) R. B. HOWORTH,W. F. WACKRILL,Joint Secretaries to the Sub-Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 21, 1929.1. We state in our Report (paragraph 97) that the estimated saving to the Unemployment Insurance Fund is  9,000,000 in the first year. This does not mean a yearly saving of  9,000,000. Scheme C is temporary, and the number of people whom it takes out of the industrial sphere diminishes yearly by deaths and by the retirements due to advancing age and infirmity, which would in any case have occurred. Further, of the  m9, I estimate that  m2 would be attributable to savings on unemployment insurance benefit payable to persons over 60, all of whom will have ceased within five years to be insured against unemployment.Broadly, we may say (A) that  m.7 will be the initial saving on unemployment insurance benefit to persons under 60, who will be filling vacancies that would have continuously decreased in number and would have nearly disappeared at the end of ten years, while (B)  m2 will be the initial saving on unemployment insurance benefit to people over 60, and that this item will disappear in five years.2. On the assumption, therefore, that the industrial situation remains for a long period as it is at present (a very important qualification), and that periodical extensions of the &quot; transitional &quot; provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act will be made by amending legislation in order to maintain the payment of benefit to persons with less than 30 contributions to their credit (an equally important condition), I estimate that the cost of unemployment insurance benefit saved as the result of Scheme C will have fallen in the fifth year of the scheme to about  m3.3.   Two new points now arise as the result of the proposals in the Bill (a.) Owing to an alteration in rates and conditions, the cost of unemploymentinsurance benefit is to be increased. (&amp;.) A new grant is to be made by the Exchequer, to cover part of the cost of unemployment insurance benefit, namely, that applicable to certain persons who are drawing benefit, although they have less than the requisite 30 contributions to their credit. Each of these factors will disturb the figures quoted in our report on the basis of existing conditions.4. As regards (a), the &quot;over-all&quot; addition to the cost of benefits is about 12^ per cent. It is, however, little over 10 per cent, in respect of persons who have the necessary 30 contributions to their credit to give them an orthodox insurance title to benefit. It is 21 per cent, in the case of those who have no such title and for whom the &quot;conditions &quot; are relaxed as well as (in some cases) the rates increased. The difference is important, because, in estimating the effect on the initial  m9 and succeeding amounts, we have to consider (i) to what extent the &quot; replacers &quot; will respectively be drawn from persons in the two categories, i.e., &quot;with&quot; and &quot; without &apos;&apos; 30 contributions to credit, and (ii) to what extent the persons over the age of 60 who will claim the pension are at present respectively in the two categories.As to (i), it is estimated that about 15 per cent, of all the benefit drawn is paid to persons with less than 30 contributions to their credit.   But it is doubtful whether[20212a]
the &quot; replacers &quot; will be so distributed that 15 per cent, of the  m7 saved on them will relate to these persons who only get benefit under the &quot; transitional &quot; provisions. Vacancies will tend to be filled by persons with the same industrial qualifications as those who retire, and unemployed persons in industries with a heavy rate of unemployment (among which a large proportion of those who get their benefit by virtue of the transitional provisions are to be found), but without a correspondingly heavy proportion of aged workers, will not have the same chance of employment as those attached to industries where better conditions prevail. It seems unsafe, therefore, to assume that the filling of vacancies by those who have to rely for benefit on the transitional provisions will ease the payments under these provisions by more than 10 per cent.   On this basis the initial  m7 will be adjusted as follows :  m. m7 x 90 per cent, x 110 per cent. = 6-93 (a).  m7 x 10 per cent, x 121 per cent. = 0-85 (b).Total   ... ....       7-78In regard to (ii), the persons over the age of 60 whose unemployment insurance benefit is paid under the transitional provisions may be about 25 per cent, of all who are drawing benefit in this age group. The whole of such persons may be expected to claim the pension. Their unemployment benefit on the present basis of rates and conditions can be put at  800,000; under the new conditions this would be increased by about 21 per cent. As the whole amount of the benefit paid under present conditions to persons over 60 who will take the pension is estimated at  2 million, the amount payable to those who satisfy the 30 contributions rule is estimated at  1,200,000; under the new conditions this will be increased by 10 per cent.   The effect on the  m2 is thus as follows :  m. 1,200,000 x 110 per cent. = 1-32 (a).   800,000 x 121 per cent. = 0-97(6).2-29The combined item to take the place of the  m9 under the new conditions is thus  m (7-78 + 2-29) =  mlO-07.5. As stated in 3 (&amp;) above, some part of the cost of unemployment insurance benefit is to be borne by the Exchequer, and this will include the figures to which (6) is appended in the last paragraph. Of the  ml0-07 relief in unemployment benefit resulting in the first year from the acceptance of retirement pensions,  m8-25 will accrue to the Unemployment Insurance Fund and  ml-82 to the Exchequer. The latter is a direct abatement of the  m21 - 6 cost of the pensions. The abatement will be increased to a small extent by saving on the cost of administering unemployment insurance benefit, say,  200,000.6.   The position will, therefore, stand as follows :  Cost of Pensions in first year... Saving on State grant to Unemployment Insur-ance Benefit m.Saving to Unemployment Insurance Fund ... 8-2 Saving to Local Authorities ... ...      1&apos;0 m. 21-62-019-69- net cost of the scheme in the first year ... ... 10-47. I have not attempted to revise the figures relating to the saving on unemployment benefit under Schemes A and B. As we are not recommending these schemes, perhaps a footnote to indicate that the relevant figures relate to the present arrangements as to unemployment benefit will be sufficient in these cases.(Initialled)        A.
