At their Meeting on October 22nd, 1929,   (Cabinet 40 (29)Conclusion 3), the Cabinet had before them a MenorandumOH.A. 22 (29)) by the Home Secretary covering the draftFactories Bill, together with the recommendations of theHome Affairs Committee thereon (H.A.C. 8th Conclusions  (29),Minute 2) and agreed that a Cabinet Committee composed of -The Home Secretary (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Tho Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsancl the Colonies,  and The ivdnister of Labour,should meet to examine the various points on which theHome Secretary desired a decision and to report to theCabinet.2.      The Home Secretary has circulated to the Committee a Memorandum (Appendix I)  setting out the considerations to which, in his view, regard should be had in discussing the questions of policy,  comprised in the terms of reference. 3.      As stated on page 6 of the Memorandum the Home Secretary found it unnecessary to invite tho Committee to consider Clause 72 - General Provision as to the hours of employment of women and young persons as the Cabinet Committee on the Hours of Employment Bill had agreed that the provisions of
Clause 72 fell within the proposal which that Committee are to rocommend to the Cabinet.4.      Of the remaining 12 questions the Committee have reached full agreement in the case of 10, their recommendations in regard to which are as follows:-.fl) Clause 5.    Cubic space of workrooms,, The Committee accept the view that an exemption must be allowed in respect of existing factories but they have invited the Home Secretary to consider whether it could not be qualified in some way so as to prevent it being an absolute and unconditional exemption:   for instance, it was suggested that it should not be possible for existing factories which at present satisfy the 400 cubic feet requirement, to effect a reduction in future.     The Home Secretary has indicated that it would be impracticable to prevent any modification in the conditions in existing factories, but he has agx&quot;eed to consider limiting   the exemption as far as possible.(2) Clause 58.      Washing facilities,(3) Clause 59.      Accommodation for clothing.(4)  Clause 44.    Weekly rest day.(5)  Clause^ 51.      Humid factories.(6) Clause^ 54a      Prohibition of night work in bakehouses. The Committee recommend that Clauses dealing with the above matters, in the form suggested by the Home Secretary, should be included in the Bill.(7) Clause 57.^    Prohibition of employment of persons In Tiftang laeavy&apos; wef-ghts&quot;.The Committee recommend the inclusion of Clause 57 in the Bill and that subsection (l) of the
Clause should apply to adult male workers as well as to women and juveniles.(8)    Slause 95.__Certificates of fitness for employment*      &quot;of Young persons .The Committee recommend, that the Clause in theBill raising the age below which intending entrants to a factory are required to be examined and passedby the Certifying Surgeon from 16 to 18 should stand.(9)    Provision regarding use of lead paint.The Committee recommend that the use of lead paint should not be dealt with in the Bill.(10)  Provisions regarding holidays with pay.The Committee recommend that provisions on this subject should not be included in the Bill*5*      The position in regard to the remaining questions Is as follows  :-Clause 75.      Overtime.Two opposing views were put forward in the Committee^ One view was that,  apart from the provision for special overtime in certain industries where seasonal pressure exists, perishable materials are handled and so on (as In the existing Acts), as to the necessity of which the Committee was in agreement,  some moderate provision must be made for overtime In any class of factories if the ordinary exigencies of industry, as they exist at present, are to be met.    It was pointed out in support of this view that though a standard 48 hours week is now being worked in the vast majority of factories,  it Is always possible under the existing statutory limit of 60 hours (55-1 in textile factories)  for women and young persons to work overtime as long
9 Pas trie statutory limit is not exceeded.      The other view was that any provision for overtime generally would in effect mean that the 48 hours week to which the Government is pledged could be abandoned and that there would be nothing to prevent employers from working 50 hours regularly every week, without obtaining the consent of the Home Office.During the discussion reference was made to the provisions of the Washington Convention with regard to overtime.      It was pointed out that a provision for overtime generally -would be in conflict with those provisions.    On the other hand, the Committee were given to understand that the Cabinet Committee which is considering the Hours of Employment Bill are of opinion that that Bill must allow elasticity and the Cabinet at their meeting on October 16th (Cabinet Conclusions 33 (29)) agreed to the Committee&apos; s proposal that &quot;there should be a wide permission to work overtime In cases of pressure of work&quot;.In the circumstances the Committee have agreed that the decision on the overtime provisions of the Factories Bill must depend on the decision to be taken by the Cabinet with regard to the nature of the Clauses to be inserted in the draft Hours of Employment Bill. Ihe- provision to be inserted in the Factories Bill will be kept within the limits so laid down. Clause 80.      The two shift system. The Committee were divided on this question also. The present position in regard to the two shift system, which allows employment in two shifts between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.,  is set out in pages /
7 to 9 of F.B.C.  (29) 2,  (Appendix I) from which it will he seen that the Home Secretary is in favour of the inclusion of a provision for the system in the Factories Bill hut with the omission of the present limitation on the Secretary of State&apos;s power to revoke an order.      The views of the Minister of labour are set out in memorandum IP.B.C.  ( 9) 3 (Appendix II) where the conclusion is reached that the Bill should contain provisions enabling the system to be applied where it is desirable, but subject to proper safeguards in the interests of health and social amenity.A contrary view was taken by the Secretary of State for vVar and the Secretary of State for 1&apos;oreign Affairs, &quot;who pointed out that the system has been consistently opposed by the labour Party while in opposition and that so recently as last year the late Under Secretary of State for the Home Office moved the omission from the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill of the provision in the Act of 1920 which sanctions the system.      In their view the objection to the system is that wcmen and young persons are placed by it in a worse position than they were in since before the war when work could not normally begin before 6 a.m. cr end later than 8 p.m.The Cabinet has already decided to include a provision in this year&apos;s Expiring Laws&apos;Continuance Bill continuing the system in existence for another year*
It is understood that some of our own supporters will contest this decision on the Bill and the Government will therefore be calleddetermination appears to the Gouanittee to be (1) whether the Government should agree to drop the provisions dealing, with the two shift system both from the Expiring Laws Sill and the Factories Bill and should face the proepect of some tens of thousands losing their employment on January 1st; or (2) whether they should omit any reference to the system in the Factories Bill and defend its continuance as a temporary measure in the Expiring Laws Bill;  or (3) whether they should not deal with it in both Bills end leave the principle to be decided on a proposal in the Factories Fill to make the system a permanent part of our factory legislation.upon to state their policy.The auesticn fore a onbehalf of the Committee.J.E.

oument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)this DoMiag E C R.EJT. F.B.C.   (29)  2.C A B I K . E . T .FACTORIES BILL COMMITTEE.p01icy in regard to outstanding,point Memorandum by the Home Secretary.It will probably be of convenience to my colleagues on the Factory Bill Committee and may shorten our deliberations if they are aware beforehand of the considerations, as I see them, which should be weighed in any discussion on the points of policy in connection with the Factories Bill whioh were reserved by the Home Affairs Committee for consideration by the Cabinet (H. A.  0.  8 (29) Conclusion 2).    The Committee should,  I think, bear in mind apart from the merits of the various provisions that we may expect criticism from two quarters; from our own side if our present proposals fall short of those of the Labour Government^   &quot;Bill of 1924, and from the Opposition if our proposals go beyond those contained in the late Government&apos;s Bill of 1926.    On the one hand we may be told by our supporters that by omitting or modifying this or that provision we have jeopardised the interests of the factory workers,  and on the other we shall certainly be accused of prejudicing the recovery of industry and the diminution of unemployment by adding financial burdens to industry which industry can ill afford to bear.I will now deal seriatim with the reserved points and I may say that the subjects to which I draw special attention and on which decisions are required are(fi) Night work in bake houses.(9) Overtime.(10) Two Shift system.(12) Lead paint.(13) Holidays with pay.(l)      Clause 3o    Cubic space of work-rooms.      Under the existing law, the average amount of cubic space to be allowed for each person is 250 cubic feet during ordinary working hours, and 400 during overtime.    The minimum of 250 cubic feet is generally recognised as being too low,  and in the Labour Government^ Bill of 1924 it was proposed to raise the minimum for all factories -existing and to be built      to 400 cubic ft.et.    It was subsequently represented to the late Government that in the case particularly of the smaller establishments such as work-shops, limitation of space,  structural conditions etc., would make it physically impossible to provide the accommodation in the existing premises with the result that compliance with the law would necessarily involve discharges of workmen, and that ever, when such conditions did not exist, employers,  rather than face the difficulty and. expense of building would prefer to discharge workers in excess of the number for whom space could be provided.    Accordingly in the late Governments Bill of 1926 it was proposed to raise the limit to 400 cubic feet in the case only of factories to be built after the Bill became law.The question therefore which this Committee has to consider is whether the raising of the limit to 400 cubic feet should apply to all factories including
- 2 -existing factories,  or only to those to be built after the Bill becomes law. It is,  of course,  in the older factories that the need for this reform is greatest,  and until those buildings have disappeared, conditions will obtain which are much below the standard of modern factories.    On the other hand, to apply the new provisions to existing factories will certainly lead to unemployment whether because conditions preclude additions to existing premises or because employers cannot or are not prepared to face the cost.    Moreover, with improved systems of ventilation and heating and with shorter working hours the need for greater space per person though still present, is not so pressing as it was twenty years ago.In my view the arguments against including existing factories in the provision are conclusive and in the Bill I have limited its application to new factories.(2)    Clause 58.    &quot;/ashing facilities.    The provision of facilities for washing has been compulsory for many years,  under Regulation, in the dangerous trades, and,  under the Welfare provisions of the Police, Factories (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1916, Welfare Orders, requiring the provision of such facilities have been made in twelve industries.    The question to be determiner is whether the time has not now come when this requirement should be made general for all factories.    In my view that time has come.    To be able to wash,  even though the work be comparatively clean,  before meals and before going home, not only makes for the comfort and health of the workers but, what I regard as even more important,  encourages the sense of self respect.    This view was accepted by the last Labour Government and expressed in their Bill of 1924.The late Government came to the conclusion that the expense involved was not justified and dropped the provision from their Rill of 1926.    I do not pretend that there is not something of a case for so doing.    There are no doubt many instances where the workers have not used or have abused the facilities provided, but I am convinced that this state of affairs, which is by no means general, will not persist especially if the Trades Unions would carry on,  as I should like to see them do, an active propaganda among their members in favour of the proper use of such facilities.    It is also objected that the provision of washing facilities is only necessary in the case of dirty occupations, and there is already power to require such provision under the Act of  1916.    This is a specious argument which twenty or thirty years ago would have carried the day but which, with the general advance in the standard of living and education of the people as a whole, has lost most of its force.    Compliance with the Clause will,  of course,  involve occupiers in expense, but it need not be considerable. The best employers,  even though under no statutory obligation to do so, have already provided washing facilities for their workers.I should perhaps add that 1 have slightly modified the Clause of the 1924 Bill in so far as I am asking occupiers to provide one washing basin for every 15 persons employed, and not,  as in the 1924 Bill, one for every 10 employed,,I ask the Committee to approve this Clause,(3)    Clause 39.    Accommodation for clothing.      Provision of accommodation on factory premises for keeping and drying the eutdoor clothing of woricers has been required for many years by Regulations governing dangerous industries.&apos; and more
recently this requirement has been extended under the Act of 191ft to twelve other industries.    I am now proposing - and in doing so I shall be restoring the clause from the Labour Bill of 1924 which was dropped in the Bill of 192fi -to make the requirement a general one applying to all factories.    The provision is of course important from the point of view of health:    wet clothing is the cause of rheumatism.    I hope the Committee will support me.I do not think that this Clause will be seriously contested.    The objection hitherto raised to it - that the workers prefer to have their outdoor clothing under their eyes in their work-rooms - has been based on the incorrect assumption that the Clause requires the provision of a separate cloakroom.(4)    Clause 44.    Weekly Rest-day.    This clause gives effect so far as workers in factories are concerned to the main provisions of the draft Convention which was adopted by the International Labour Conference at Geneva in 1921 concerning the &quot;application of the weekly rest in industrial undertakings&quot;.    The Clause appeared in the previous Labour Governments Bill of 1924 but was omitted from the Conservative Bill of 192fi.The principal objections made to the Clause of 1924 were first, that the hours of work of adult males have never been regulated in Factory legislation; secondly that the weekly rest - and for a longer period than that provided in the Bill    - is already normally enjoyed in this country,  and thirdly, that, as the Clause was then drafted urgent work whether of maintenance or repair could not in the absence of the Home Secretary&apos;s permission be done over the weekend.To take the last objection first, I have modified the Clause of 1924 so as to exclude from its operations those,  other than the ordinary factory hauOs, engaged on urgent work.As to the first objection,  it is true that the Factory Acts have not hitherto dealt with the periods of employment of adult males,  except in some special dangerous trades, but it is wrong,  in my view, to regard this provision simply as one to regulate hours.    It is on all fours with other welfare provisions, which are for the benefit of men and women alike, and its inclusion in the Bill can,  on that ground,  be justified.The second, objection is really no objection at all for if the weekly rest is normal in England the making statutory of an existing practice will not inflict any hardship.    Moreover,  the objection overlooks the positive advantage to be gained by industry generally.    It is to the interest of British industry that other industrial countries should follow our example in this natter and should be induced to give effect to this Convention.    We ought to give no excuse to other Governments to refrain from ratifying the Convention - limited as it is to requiring a 24 hours break - on the ground that Great Britain has taken no steps to put it into effect.I hope I shall have the support of the Committee in including this Clause in the Bill.(5)    Clause 51o    Humid Factories.    The only provision of this section which falls to be considered is paragraph (b) of sub-section (l).
In the Labour Government&apos;s Bill of 1924 there was a provision prohibiting the use of artificial humidity when the wet bulb reading exceeded 75$ or, for certain special classes of material, 80^.    This provision was dropped by the Conservative Government (though they retained substantially the - rest of the Clause)    and I propose to restore it,  substituting 72-1$ for 75$.The history of the question of humidification is a long one and the jtexisting law on the subject is most complicated.    Briefly the position is this. I do not propose to touch in the Bill Cotton Cloth Factories which are subject to Regulations made under the Cotton Cloth Factories Act of last year, nor do I propose to touch flax and tow factories or hemp and jute factories which are also subject to special Regulations.    What 1 do propose to do by sub-section 1 (b) is to apply to all other factories except those specially mentioned in the sub-section, the same limit of temperature (i.e. 72-^ wet bulb) at which the introduction of artificial humidity must cease,  as operates now in Cotton Cloth factories.    It will be recalled that that limit was unanimously recommended for cotton cloth factories by the Departmental Corafiittee on which both operatives and employers were represented, that legislation was passed last year to enable the Home Secretary to give effect by Regulation to those recommendations, and that Regulations were made and are now in force.    Except in the case of the few processes for which I have made special provision in sub-section 1 (b),  I know of no substantial reason why the introduction of artificial humidity into any factory should be allowed at a higher temperature than is allowed in the case of cotton cloth factories.I hope that my colleagues will agree with me in restoring this provision to the Bill.(n)      Clause 54.    Prohibition of night work in bakehouses.This Clause gives effect to the main recommendations of a Departmental-Committee of which the Chairman was the present Lord Amulree on the subject which reported in 1919 and restores the provision of the Labour Governments Bill of 1924 which was dropped from the Conservative Bill of 1926.I do not think that 1 need trouble the Committee with a history of this question.    The arguments from the Operatives side are well known and I think we are bound to go as far as possible to meet them, more especially as( apart from the material consideration of a possible increase in the cost of the loaf the principle underlying the Clause has not been seriously disputed by any Government since the Departmental Committee of 1919 reported.I should, however, warn the Committee that the Clause as drafted will not entirely satisfy the Operatives and will arouse keen opposition from the Master bakers.The prohibition of night baking formed the subject of a Convention adopted by the International Labour Conference in 19 24,  and the Clause in the Bill will be criticised by our own supporters on the ground that it falls short of the Convention.    This is perfectly true.    The Convention embraced all classes of premises in which baking is carried on - including hotels, restaurants, hospitals and other institutions whether subject  to factory inspection or not - and it applied without qualification to proprietors as well as to operatives.    Provision to give full effect to the Convention would in my
view be quite alien to factory legislation and,the most that we can or ought to do in a Factories Bill is to implement the recommendations of the 1919 Committee-    These recommendations secure for those employed in premises coming under the Bill, the abolition of night baking.    I received a day or two ago from the two Unions concerned a Deputation which urged on me the desirability of giving legislative  effect to the Convention as a whole,    They informed me however that they would be prepared reluctantly to accept,  in the absence of anything ietter, the Clause in the Bill.    From our supporters,therefore,  the most that we need anticipate is,  I think,  a demonstration.The opposition from the employers is,  however, likely to be serious, on the ground that the  change will involve heavy cost,  disorganisation and dis-looatiori of the industry, and an increase in the price of bread.    In support of the last they will quote the conclusion at which the Sub-Committee of the Royal Commission Oi: Food Prices, which considered the question in 1925,  arrived, that, &quot;if new bread is to be supplied in the same condition of newness to the same points and in the same quantities and at the same time In the morning as it is now, the cost of the loaf will  be increased and it is impossible to say that this -Increase wi.ll be purely temporary.&quot;    The Sub-Committee thought that this increase would not,  on the average,  exceed -gd. per quartern loaf.I doubt whether the results will be so serious as are alleged.    The large factories  who   send out their bread over a wide area and therefore have to start work early if they are to get their bread on the counters of the local retailers in time for the midday meal,  as they do at present, may be handicapped to some extent in their corn-petition with the small local baker,  but the difficulty may to some extent be  r,iei   by the increased use of motor transport and in other ways. I have also proposed that this Clause should net come into operation for a period, unspecified in the Bill, but which I suggest should be,  as the 1919 Committee recommended, two years, and I have taken power to grant exemptions.    The two years interval and the discreet use of the power of exemptions should do much to obviate disorganisation and by spreading the capital cost of alterations, where alterations are required,  over a fairly long period will ease the burden for employers.As to the increased cost of bread, we must face the position that such an increase is,  at any rate,  a possibility.The 1919 Committee on which was a prominent accountant,  did not think that any increase in the cost of the loaf would be entailed,  but the Sub-Committee (which included the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade) of the Pxyal Commission on Food Prices,  considered that the Committee had under-estiraated the possibilities and came to the conclusion quoted above. In my view, however, the risk of an increase,  small as I think it is, will be made even smaller if sufficient time is given for the industry to adapt itself to the proposed new conditions.
heavy weights.1 regret that the words &quot;woman or young&quot; were left in Clause 57  (l) in square brackets.   My intention is that sub-section (l) shall apply to all persons employed in a factory.The original proposal in the Labour Government^ Bill of 1924, which was retained in the Conservative Bill of 1926, was to limit the prohibition to women and young persons and to the principle of this proposal the employers in their discussions with ny Department,  raised no objection.      I think, however, that we ought to make an effort to secure the same statutory protection for men as for women and young persons.    No doubt the effects of excessive weight lifting are, or may be.- more serious in the- case of the last two than the first: but there is evidence in certain branches of the textile industry at any rate,  that in the absence of statutory Regulation, men wore required to move or were in the habit of moving,  excessive weights. Regulations on the subject have been made for the woollen and worsted indus-tries and in the Cotton trade an Agreement has been reached with regard to the carrying of beams in weaving sheds.    It is true that no general request has been put forward on behalf of labour for the protection in this regard of adult males, but    I think that a provision of general application,  such as 1 propose, would be welcomed by factory workers.(8)o Clause 72. General Provision as to hours of employment of/TQmeri and young persons. I need r.ot now trouble the Committee to consider this Clause.    It was agreed at the last meeting of the Hours of Employment Bill Committee that its provisions fell within the four corners of the proposal which that Committee are to recommend to the Cabinet.(9)    Clause 75. Overtime. Since the Clause was drafted, I have had the opportunity of considering its provisions with the Hours of Employment Bill Committee? and I propose to reaast it in the light of what will, I understands be their proposals. The Clause as drafted follows that of the Labour Bill of 1924,    but I agree with the Hours of Employment Bill Committee that some general provision for overtime in excess of the standard 48 hours is desirable.    At the present time, overtime can be- and is being worked bv women and young persons in excess of the 48 hours,  subject of oourse to - the    statutory maximum of 60 hours fixed by the Factory and Workshop Aat, 1901.       In the *ase of women employed in factories, I think however that we must impose some limit to the amount of overtime that may be worked without special permission.       I would accordinglylike to obtain the .assent of the Committee to a new Clause drawn on the following lines:-Overtime may be worked, without previous application to the Home Secretary, up to a total of, on an average over the year, not more than two hours a week, with a proviso that not more than 4 hours overtime shall be worked in anv one week.    Further, that as in the Labour Bill of 19 24,  certain
Sis j-olasses of employment where perishable materials are handled or which are subject to exceptional pressure of work,additional overtime should be allowed. I suggest a limit of (on the average) one additional hour in the week and not more than 3 in any week to be granted by order of the Secretary of State.These limits are substantially one same as those adopted by the late Government and will I imagine bo accepted without serious opposition.The overtime so to be allowed is not excessive.    The total number of hours that can be worked in the week is       (or 59 in the industries with additional overtime; and the average uumuer over the whole year is juo-t&apos;-underA further question is whether overtime is to be allowed for young persons er only for women.     Under the existing Act of 1901 overtime is not allowed in the case of young persons but the reduction of the legal weekly limit from 60 to 48 heurs introduces a new and important factor into the situation.      The reports of lb&apos;- Factory Inspectors show (see the Annual Report   for 1926, page 59) that young persons are generally employed during the same hours as the adults working in the same Department.     This is largely due to the fact that their work is interdependent.   Where hours in excess of the 48 hour week are worked to meet the special trade demands in the majority of cases the young persons would be employed on overtime with the others.     Of courses there are a large number of industries where young persons work with adult men or with adult women. I am inclined to think that the overtime provisions should apply to young persons over 16 as well as to women.10 *   Clause 80.    Exceptions as to employment of women and youngpersons in shifts. The existing provision on this subject (^Section 2 of the Employment    -of Women, Young Persons and Children&apos;s Act,  1920) expired at the end of 1925 and has since been continued from year to year by the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts.        The Cabinet have decided that the provision shall be continued in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill this year, and I am now asking the Committee to consider whether it shall be included also in the Factories Bill and. so become a permanent part of our factory sj^stem.This system, by which women and young persons over 16 may, by permission of the Secretary of State and subject to such conditions as he may impose, be employed on a system of two shifts between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. has come in for a good doal of criticism in certain quarters in the Labour and Trade Union movements, and its continuance has been opposed by Labour Members in the Debates on the Expiring Laws Continuance Bills.    There will,    however, be very serious practical difficulties in the way of dropping the provision and while there may be disadvantages In the system, there is a good deal of evidence to show that it also has substantial advantages in certain circumstances.The system was first introduced during the war as a means of avoiding long hours of work and overtime, and so lessening the fatigue and increasing the efficiency of the workers.    The question of continuing the system after the war was considered by a Committee on Women&apos;s Employment appointed by the
Ministry of Reconstruction (1919) and by a Departmental Committee specially appointed in 1920 to examine the system in the light of objections ./hich had been raised in Labour quarters.   Both Committees reported favourably.     The latter Committee, however,  stated that the experience of the system so far obtained was not sufficient to enable them to recommend its incorporation as a permanent part of our factory legislation, but they thought it was&apos;in the national interest,  subject to proper safeguard and supervision,  that an opportunity for trying the system should be given.    It was on this recommendation that Section 2 of the Act of 1920 was passed.No general right to work on the two shift system is given by the Section. A factory which desires to do so has to obtain an Order from the Secretary of State authorising the adoption of the system and the application must be supported by a majority of the workpeople in the factory who are concerned in the matter.    The Secretary of State also has power in granting the Order to impose conditions for safeguarding the welfare and interests of the workers. Before any Order is granted, the circumstances of the factory are carefully investigated by the Inspector of Factories who satisfies himself on the point whether the majority of the wm-kers are in favour,   considers what welfare conditions are required,  inquires    as to the distance which workers will have to travel, and considers whether any transport facilities are required,  etc., etc.    and on his report the Secretary of State decides whether he can grant the Order or not.    The working of the system has been carefully watched by the Factory Department and the results have been reviewed from time to time in the Annual Reports of the Chief Inspector of Factories.    The recently issued Report for 1928 summarises the experience up to date.    The conclusions arrived at by the Factory Department are favourable to the system.    The Chief inspector concludes his last review with the following words, &quot;On the whole the advantages of tho system at present appear to outweigh the disadvantages, and there is no evidence of any substantial antipathy to it on the part of the workers concerned&quot; He points out that though the general depression in industry has not been specially favourable for experimenting with the system, Orders have been obtained in a wide variety of industries and serve a variety of purposes, e.g., by enabling firms  (a) to cope with rush   orders and so retain their markets, (b) to keep their workers together after such a disaster as a fire or a serious breakdown of plant,   (c) to co-ordinate processes during the introduction of new methods and plant,   (d) to facilitate the flow of work through a department which might otherwise become choked and form a bottle-ne*k,  etc., etc.Up to the end of June last 852 Orders have been granted in respeot of 730 works and the most recent reports show that aut of this number 330 Orders directly affecting the employment of 17,400 persons are still in use.    The number of workers who are indirectly affected,  e.g. the workers in subsequent departments whose supply of work is dependent on the two shift system at a previous  stage., oannot be stated, but is considerable.In the great artificial silk works at Spondon, work has been organised on -che basis of  this system and some 3,500 workers are employed under a two shift OrdersIt appears to me to be very difficult in these circumstances to drop the system,    Its discontinuance will throw a considerable number of persons
o. Pi5 out of work and will cause a good deal of disorganisation in the factoriesooncernedo    I do not know on what grounds we could justify such a step inParliament,,    The grounds for the dislike which is entertained for the system in certain Labour and Trade Union quarters are that the early start mustthat.involve considerable hardship on workers who live at a distance,/with the late finish women and girls have to find their way home late at night, that the double ^shift system disorganises domestic arrangements, and so on. The question of distance is one which is always considered by the Home Office before an Order is granted, and arrangements made either that the workers on the shift system shall bo drawn from the immediate neighbourhood or that adequate transport facilities shall be provided.    There is no general dislike for the system felt by the workers themselves.    The Inspectors report that some are enthusiastic for it, others are indifferent; and a few dislike it but prefer it to unemployment.    The system generally seems a shorter working week, averaging 41^ working hours, excluding meal times.    There is no evidence that the health of the workers is in any way affected by the system.   On the contrary an investigation oarried out by the Industrial Fatigue Research Board in eight factories employing in all about 2,400 workers on the shift system resulted in the conclusion that &quot;neither day shift   nor two shift is shown to have any advantage over the other in respect of sickness experienced&quot;.One marked advantage of this system is that it provides a means for meeting pressure of work without resort to overtime, and in this way not only lessens fatigue but also provides employment for additional workers. The system has been adopted, for instanoe, with success in fruit preserving, where at one time women used to be employed during four months of the year for excessively long hours.Complaint has been made from time to time that the Trade Unions are not oonsultod before an Order is given to an individual factory.    It would, I think, be difficult to   introduce a new principle of this kind into the Factory Acts. The Act of 1920 provides that&quot;where the opinion of an industry as a whole is opposed to the issue of two shift Orders in the industry, a joint representation of employers and workers may be made to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State is required to act on the representation..   As a matter of fact, however, no such representation has ever been made and I propose that if the system is retained, this provision should be dropped.    Any representations from a Trade Union in respect of the issue of   an Order would be carefully oonsidered by me, but I could not pledge myself to consult a Trade Union before issuing an Order to any factory in the industry which It represents. Such a procedure would hamper and delay administration to a very great extent.    I should propose, however, an alteration which will make the hands of the Secretary of State somewhat freer.     At present he only has power to revoke an Order once granted on certain specified grounds.    1 propose to drop that provision and to leave him full discretion, as in the case of other Orders under the Factory Act, to revoke an Order if and when he sees fit.I have come to the conclusion therefore that the proper course is for- the Committee to advise the Cabinet to include a provision for the system in the Factories Bill but without the present limitation on the Secretary of State&apos;s power of revocation,,
(ll)       Clause 95.    Oei-certificates of Fitness for Employmentof young persons.There is already under the existing law provision for the medical examination of young persons under IS, who enter a factory for employment. The present system has not proved wholly successful and was the subject of inquiry by a Departmental Committee appointed in 1924 by my predecessor, Mr. Henderson.    The Committee recommended the remodelling of the system in several important particulars, including the raising of the age below which intending entrants to a factory were required to be in possession of a medical certificate of fitness, from 16 to 18.    The Clause in the Labour Bill of 1924 gave effect to this Committee&apos;a recommendation but the Conservative Government, while accepting the other recommendations, left the age limit at 16.    I propose to restore the liuit of IS.The proposal will net, I think? be seriously contested.     It may be objected that persons over 16 row enjoy the benefits of the National Health Insurance Scheme but there is considerable value in the exercise of medical supervision of the adolescent in industry, and I can see no adequate reason why the supervision should not be extended to young persons entering or continuing factory life between 16 and 18 years of age.(12)     Provisions regarding the use of Lead Paint.The Bill as drafted contains no provisions regarding the use of lead paint in building work.,      Tho history of this question is a long and compli-oatcd one.   Briefly, in 1921, a Convention was adopted by the International Labour Conference which provided for regulation respecting the use of lead paint in the exterior painting of buildings but with certain exceptions prohibited altogether the use of white lead in internal painting.     The Convention became the subject of acute controversy but in 1924 the Labour Government decided in favour of ratification and Mr. Henderson introduced a Bill for the purpose.    This Bill net with serious opposition from Liberal as well as Conservative sides and Lir. Henderson was only able to carry the Second Reading by promising that if the prohibition clause was defeated by a majority in Committee, he would accept the decision and proceed with the Regulations provisions.    The Bill made no further progress&apos;.The lato Government adopted a different policy.    They decided that regulations ought to be tried first for interior as well as exterior painting, on the understanding that if regulations failed resort would then be had to prohibition.      They therefore postponed the question of ratification and introduced and carried the Lead Paint Act.      This Act took effect on 1st January,  1927.. but the regulations which wore proposed met y^ith considerable opposition from different quarters and had to be the subject of a Public Inquiry with the result that they only came into operation on the 1st October 1927.     They have therefore only been in force for two years and it is hardly possible as yet to form any reliable estimate as to their efficiency    The figures of cases for the last two years do not indeed show any substantial reduction as compared with the figures for the two previous years,   -but before 1927 notification of. lead poisoning, in this industry was not compulsory, and if,- as is probable,  the Act has   led to better notification,  the figures for
the last two years might indicate a real reduction.     Moreover the cases notified in 1928 did not necessarily originate in 1928.The difficulty of enforcing the observance of the regulations is obvious, but since they were made, numerous conferences have been held with both the Employers and Workers organisations (national and local) as a result of which a large measure of co-operation has been obtained from both sides and reports from the faotory inspectors show that substantial progress has been made in securing compliance with the regulations.Such is the present position.      There seems to me to be three courses open to us:      (l)    to consolidate the Lead Paint Act of 1925 in the Bill and face the inevitable revival of the controversy which must ensue. (2) to insert in the Bill provisions to give effect to the Convention which will arouse violent opposition from both Conservatives and Liberals, and will impede if not prejudice the passage of the Bill, or (3) to omit the subject altogether from the Bill and  rely  upon the experience now being gained. This last is, I feel sure, the wisest course.    The Trade has, with .:.onsiderabl trouble and difficulty, been adapting itself for the last two years to the altered conditions brought about by the regulations and I would prefer to leave it without further disturbance until 1 am in a position to judge the degree of success which the regulations have achieved.     1 might add that the Operative painters have not since 1 assumed Office made any represent-tions on the subject.(13)   provisions regarding holidays with pay.The insert!oa ox&apos; a clause on this point in the Bill of 1924 was raised by Mr. Henderson, who was then in charge of the Bill, in his memorandum to the Cabinet, but the Cabinet decided in the circumstances of that time thatthe clause would tend to overweight the Bill and.should not be inserted./The voluntary movement in favour of holidays with pay is making steady progress in industry, and in the August number of the Ministry of Labour &quot; Gazette a list is given of collective agreements in force between Employers and Workers organisations on the subject.    I have made inquiries of the Ministry of Labour and they estimate roughly that about lh million manual workers are affected by these agreements which however cover some occupations not within the scope of a Factories Bill.    (in addition to this figure, there would be large numbers of salaried clerks, shop assistants and other salaried employees who are regularly granted holidays with pay,  as well as many -workers on   standing wages.)       There are also wage earners employed by some individual firms who are not parties to collective agreements.     Since the Article referred to appeared in the Gazette,  employees In Government establishments with a full year&apos;s service have been allowed annual holiday a with pay.     The number so affected is about 86,000.At the recent Trade Union Congress a resolution was adopted to the offewt that the time was opportune to press for holidays with pay for all workers.   1 feel however, very dubious whether this is the time and the Factories Bill the place, for such a provision.   While the list in the Ministry of Labour Gazette shows that payment for holidays is mads m numerous branches of industry, the great majority of workers in many of the
largest industries are not paid and a statutory provision which would make it universally compulsory in factories would, I think, be premature.    The additional charge on industry would provoke acute controversy and in my view it would be best to leave the voluntary movement to develop further before initiating legislation.I depreoate too the inclusion of such a provision in a Factories Bill. It is not concerned with the health or safety of the workers, and in so far as it affects employment, would extend not only to women and young persons, but also to adult men.I hope that the Committee will not press me to include a provision on this subject in the Bill. It should be a matter for separate legislation tfl apply to wage earners generally.26.10.29 .jeRo Oo

Memorandumiby the Minister of La^baur^ 1.     The Two Shift system may be considered from four points of view (A)   Economic(3)   hours of 7ork of Employees (0)   Employment (D)   Health.(A). Economic.(i) The trend of industrial production is towards the increase of labour-saving machinery?&quot; and larger units of production.    This increases overhead costs in two ways, a larger initial cost, and shorter life of such machinery owing to the necessity of keeping pace with new inventions and processes and the greater cost of replacement.    In order to spread these costs and to sell the product at a price which will ensure a wide market to absorb a large production, it is necessary to work the machinery the maximum number of hours per week.    In America a striking feature is the extent to which production is carried on throughout the whole 24 hours. The absence in many places of the prohibition of night work for women enables this to be applied more widely than in England.    In so far as in any country, there is a restraint on the hours during which the machinery may work, there is necessarily a difference in the price at which articles can be produced.(ii) Industries, also, with less modern equipment can appreciably reduce their costs by longer hours of production, on-costs such as rent, rates, etc being unchanged.    This may be important in meeting more acute foreign competition.    For example, there is reason for thinking that a reduction of t.* e number of mills in the woollen industry and longer operation/of
B. ---of the others would hath- r*educ-e-prices and provide more employment.    Two shifts are worked in competing countries-. (B), Hours of :.7ork of Iftnployees.The hours of work per- week need not exceed 48 and two shift systems probably offer the best means of reducing hours below this number and of avoid Ins; overtime.    If shift workers were employed 36 hours per week machinery could run 72 instead of 48 hours por week.    Greater freedom in working shift  systems would doubtloss reduce the opposition to the statutory limitation of the hours o^ workers.    It would also enable a quicker approaoh to a shorter week per worker to be made. (C )Bmployment*The possibility of increased production is, of course, dependent upon markets but these are dependent on price and quality.   There Is a diminishing difference in quality in machine-made goods wherever made,  so that the main factor is price.    The increased employment of machinery- should tend to increase both production and employment.    It would be better to have 200 persons employed 33-48 hours each than 100 persons employed in one shift of 48 hours. (D) Health.The most cogent argument against the system is that an early morning start and a late finishing hour are necessary, but experience seems to show that,  in return for leisure time in daylight, alternate mornings and afternoons, women workers are prepared to accept these conditions.    It is of great advantage in the interests of health that more of the daylight hours should be free than is possible under the system of a single day-shift.    Moreover, with modern lighting and ventilation systems the strain of evening work is much less than formerly.    There is little difference between leaving a factory at 10 p.m. and leaving a cinema at the same time or later.    \ri-th gas or electricity in more common use and greatl:/ increased facilities for food at factories, the question:&apos; /of
of obtaining food under proper conditions is more easily M       met than in earlier days.    Co-operative Societies supplyfood,  cooked under better than Lome conditions, in largequantities at the present time,   home conditions are likelyto be less dislocated than in former times. 2. It seems to be difficult to contemplate the termination oftwo-shift systems which, with the agreement of the workers concerned, have been working well, or to place obstacles in the way of their extension under the same condition of agreement. We cannot hope to get other countries to enter into agreement to abolish the tvjo-sbift system and that alone seems to be an insuperable obstacle to its abolition in this country.    It is significant that the -leavers&apos; Amalgamation now realise that they must face the adoption of the system in the interest of their industry; automatic looms will otherwise involve much unemployment which more shifts would tend to obviate. 3. My conclusion is that the Factories Bill should containprovisions enabling the system to be applied where it is desirable, but subject to proper safeguards in the interests of health and social amenity, for instance, that the Home Office should not sanction arrangements which involve an earlier start than 7.0 a.m,  or a later stop than 10.0 p.m.,  and should satisfy themselves that  adequate early and 3.ate transport facilities are available in the places affected.-(Intld. ) M.G.B.Ministry of Labour, 11th November,  1929.
