Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1929.SECRET. Copy No.      36CP. 347 (29*.CABINET.SUSPENSION BY THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT OE THE ASSISTED PASSAGE AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. (Previous Paper : CP. 321 (29).)IN his telegram of the 4th instant, Mr. Scullin states that his Government must ask us to agree to suspension of the Assisted Passage Agreement immediately, except for the reunion of families. That is to say, he brings emigration to Australia for the time being virtually to an end. He leaves it to us to decide upon the effect of the suspension upon activities under the  34 million Agreement, or any modification thereof that may be mutually arranged. He states that the suspension should operate pending full discussion of all possible means of co-operation between our respective Governments at the next Imperial Conference.Apart from the money (rather over  1 million) which has been paid from the Exchequer and which is beyond recall, the suspension of the Agreement raises two financial questions.The first is our liability to pay contributions aggregating  682,857 towards schemes accepted by us under the  34 million Agreement which have actually been begun but are not yet completed. I am prepared to consider whether, and if so to what extent, we are pledged, as the Secretary of State suggests, to make these further contributions, but it should be possible at any rate to arrange for the reduction or slowing down of the liability.The second and main question is whether we should continue to make contributions to new schemes under the Agreement involving a further liability between now and 1935 of roughly  5 millions as if nothing of significance had occurred. The Secretary of State proposes in effect that, notwithstanding the suspension by Australia of her part of the bargain, we should go on with ours, only reserving to ourselves a general discretion. I regret that I am quite unable to agree.It is hardly correct to say that the new Commonwealth Government &quot; express the hope that we shall nevertheless continue to co-operate with them under the  34 million Agreement&quot;; and on the strength of that assertion to urge &quot;that our response to the first request made to us by the new Labour Government in the Commonwealth should be such as to show that we are ready and anxious to help them in every possible way.&quot; In his telegram mentioned above, Mr. Scullin, quite properly, leaves the decision to us. And Mr. Crutchley, in his telegram of the 5th instant, says that the Prime Minister told him that &quot; it was unfair to ask the British Government to contribute its share of the bargain if Australia is unprepared to do hers.&quot; There can be no question of our going out of our way &quot;to meet the request&quot; of the new Commonwealth Government, since no request has been made by them.Even if the new Government had made a direct request I should for several reasons have been very loth to agree to it.x\australia is now shutting out immigrants coming from this country because it is suffering the economic effects of excessive Protection.   All parties there are[20222]
responsible for it, but it is inimical to us, and I notice that one of the first acts of the new Government is to propose great increases in the tariff which, notwithstanding preferences, cannot fail to be highly injurious to our trade.The Agreement which the Secretary of State asks us to continue has very serious disadvantages. I describe them in an Appendix to this memorandum. Briefly, the Agreement is expensive; its objects are liable to be nullified by Protection; it affords no guarantee of any increase in the rate of migration; and it encourages forms of development which Australia in her present economic condition is unable to afford.There is another consideration also. Our problem to-day is to remove our people from derelict towns and districts to places where they may find work. One part of this problem is the provision of an open door for willing emigrants. In our time of need Australia shuts the door in our face; however urgent and valid her internal reasons may be, that is the effect of her action. We have then to rely on Canada as the country which our emigrants must seek. How can we press Canada  where many influences bring themselves to bear against free immigration-to take more and more of our people without monetary consideration, if we reward the policy of exclusion in Australia by a gift of  5 million ?I should in any case welcome an opportunity to secure a revision of the  34 million Agreement without giving offence to the Australian Government. Mr. Scullin&apos;s decision makes it in my judgment out of the question to continue to make contributions to new development schemes. I ask my colleagues to agree-subject to examination of our liability, alluded to above, to pay contributions (to the amount of  682,857) towards accepted schemes-that the Agreement should be suspended pending full discussion at the next Imperial Conference of the best means of co-operating with Australia under the Empire Settlement Act.P. s.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1, November 29, 1929.
APPENDIX.The Disadvantages of the  34 Million Agreement.THE Agreement provides for the issue by the Commonwealth Government to the State Governments of loans at low rates of interest for approved development (including land settlement) schemes. Our contribution to the Commonwealth Government is considerable, viz., one-fifth of the capital expenditure on the approved schemes.The Agreement was adopted in 1925 on the plea of the Commonwealth Govefn-ment that what was needed to enable the Dominion to absorb migrants at a greater rate was cheap money for development.The adoption of the Agreement, under which we have contributed, including commitments,  1,800,000, has not in fact led to an increased rate of migration. The average annual number of assisted migrants for the years 1923 and 1924 (i.e., between the passing of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, and the signature of the Agreement) was 23,933. For the five years 1925 to 1929 the average will be rather less than that figure; and, with the prospect of reduced migration in the next few years, the post-Agreement average will decrease further.What are the reasons for that disappointing result ?In the first place events have shown that development in Australia has not been dependent on cheap money, for development expenditure under the Agreement has been but a small fraction of the total development expenditure from loans. And much of the loan expenditure outside the Agreement has been uneconomic, with the resulting growing burden of loan interest to be met from taxation (see Report of British Economic Mission). The State Governments have been free to undertake what development they wished, applying for contributions under the Agreement for those schemes which would pass the test; and although contributions may have been confined to sound schemes, the result in terms of migration would not have been different if the same amount of contributions had been given for unsound schemes.Secondly, development is not the only factor governing capacity to absorb additional population. The Australian Governments have unfortunately been guilty of extravagances in their administration of their tariff policy, with the result that production costs in the Dominion have become far too high; the economic position has become very difficult, and unemployment is acute (see report of British Economic Mission). We cannot control these other factors, and we have no guarantee, there-fore, that the benefits for which we contribute under the Agreement will lead to an increased flow of migration.Thirdly, whilst it is true, as the Secretary of State points out, that the Australian States have accepted obligations to absorb assisted migrants in pro-portion to the amount of assistance they receive under the Agreement, those obligations cannot be regarded as a very satisfactory quid pro quo. Apart from the fact that the obligations cannot be implemented beyond the capacity of the States to absorb additional population, they relate to the total number of assisted migrants and not to the number in excess of the pre-Agreement number. As the pre-Agree-ment annual average was 23,933, our total contributions during the currency (ten years) of the Agreement might be as much as  4^ millions without the expectation of any increased flow of migration.*Fourthly, the Agreement covers in the main development schemes of the extensive type, which, in present circumstances in Australia, are considered to be much more costly and at the same time less effective than schemes of the intensive type, from which attention has been diverted.* The Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum states that the contributions we have actually paid to date amount to  1,118,466, representing migrant absorption responsibilities of 58,455.10 *-If-&apos;- x  1,188,466      41 millions approximately.
