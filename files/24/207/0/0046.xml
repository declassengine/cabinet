Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1929.SECRET.CP. 355 (29). -CABINET.PROPOSAL TO POSTPONE THE COMPLETION OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE SCHEME OF EXPANSION FOR HOME DEFENCE UNTIL 1938.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE preparation of next year&apos;s Air Estimates is a matter of urgency and, in order that I may be in a position to get on with it, I want the consent of the Cabinet to a retardation of the expansion scheme at present governing the strength of the Royal Air Force. This retardation involves postponement of the completion of that scheme until 1938, and its effect will be to cut out of next year&apos;s estimates the initial cost of three Regular Squadrons which are due to be formed in 1930 under the existing programme. The formation of these and the remaining squadrons to be created in accordance with that programme will, in consequence, if this recom-mendation is accepted, be spread over the next eight years.2. I am bound to obtain the authority of the Cabinet for this step because the technical position at the present time is that the Air Ministry are under the obliga-tion to complete the expansion of the Home Defence Air Force to a total strength of 52 squadrons by 1935.3. The programme of expansion was settled in June 1923 on the recommenda-tion of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence appointed by the then Prime Minister to enquire into, among other things, &quot; the standard to be aimed at for defining the strength of the Air Force for purposes of Home and Imperial Defence.&quot; This Sub-Committee in view of the gravity and urgency of the matter  submitted an Interim Report, which recommended the creation of &quot;a Home Defence Air Force of sufficient strength adequately to protect us against air attack by the strongest air force within striking distance of this country.&quot; This force was to be in addition to &quot; the essential air power requirements of the Navy, Army, Indian, and Overseas commitments.&apos;&apos; The Committee further suggested that, as a &quot;first stage,&quot; a force of 52 squadrons (13 non-regular) should be provided for this purpose. This recommendation was at once reviewed and endorsed by the Cabinet, and an announcement was made by the then Prime Minister to that effect in the House of Commons on the 20th June, 1923. The date of completion aimed at was 1928, but this was not publicly announced. Subsequently, the date for completion was postponed to 1930, on the ground that the magnitude of the task confronting the Air Ministry was too great for completion in a period of five years.4. Succeeding Governments, including the Labour Government of 1924, accepted this scheme, which had indeed been very favourably received by the public, press, and Parliament. In 1925, however, the whole situation was brought under review by a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet* in the light of the Locarno Treaties and the acute financial stringency. This Sub-Committee recommended that, whilst there could be no question of curtailing the scheme, its date of completion should be postponed from 1930 to 1935.Copy No.    33[20252]* Under the Chairmanship of Lord Birkenhead.
5. Such is the past history of this matter leading up to the present situation as outlined in paragraph 2. In recommending to the Cabinet a further postpone-ment, I feel it my duty to point out the serious nature of this step, which can only be justified on the ground of the wholly exceptional exigencies of the financial situation. &apos;In the first place, I must draw the attention of my colleagues to the present first-line strengths and programmes of expansion of the principal air Powers of the world.  The following table shows the position :-Present Corresponding figureCountry. first-line on completion of strength approved programme-strength. of expansioiliFrance        ... ... 1,307 -               1,960Italy          ... ... 1,090 1,600U.S.A.        ... ... 914 1,400Great Britain ... 772 974From the above it will be seen that our strength to-day is less than two-thirds of that of our nearest neighbours, and that, even on completion of our programme, we shall be over 300 first-line machines short of their present numbers. In other words, we are not only in a position of considerable numerical inferiority, but are proposing to prolong the disparity to our disadvantage for a further period of eight years, during which the air forces of the countries named will be more rapidly augmented than ojar own. Thus, in France, a number of new units are scheduled to be formed in 1930, while, in Italy, not only has the first-line strength of the Air Force been increased by over 200 machines during the past two years, but Signor Mussolini has emphasised in the Italian Parliament his intention of building up for Italy the strongest air force in Europe.6. These facts and figures cannot be concealed from the public and those numerous and influential critics of the smallness of our Air Force, who are con-continually pointing out the risks we run in our singularly exposed position as regards air attack. Personally, I feel justified in making this recommendation to the Cabinet solely upon the ground that, although on the facts and figures as stated, our position is untenable, we can to some extent discount them and face the situation without undue anxiety, always provided that (1.) The main outline of our expansion scheme is preserved intact; and (2.) Our Air Force continues to maintain its present exceptionally high standard of training and organisation, and is further enabled to keep its technical equipment in all respects adequate and up-to-date with new types of machine and engine.7. I would submit to my colleagues that the geography of the British Empire introduces complications into our air problem fully as serious as those of our naval problem. Despite this and other factors, we have set an example to the world by the moderation^ of our building programme, which has never aimed at a one-power standard (though this has been repeatedly urged in many quarters), and which, as corn-pared with the first-line strength of France, will only give us a 50 per cent, standard on the completion of our respective programmes. There are limits, however, to this moderation, and I confess to being somewhat anxious about the agitation which is likely to ensue when the postponement suggested in this memorandum becomes public property.   We can, I believe, justify it in the light of our signature of the Kellogg* Further striking evidence of the moderation of our air programme is afforded by the following-facts : (a.) We are in 1929 spending a smaller percentage of our national expenditure as a whole on &quot;air&quot; than either France; Italy or the U.S.A.(b.) We are also spending a smaller percentage of our total defence expenditure on &quot;air&quot; than any of the three countries above mentioned.(c.) If the postponement I advocate is accepted, our gross air expenditure for 1930 will be lower than it -was five years ago. In the U.S.A., France and Italy, on the other hand, air expenditure has increased in the current year as compared with 1925 by no less than 126 per cent., 92 per cent., and 28 per cent, respectively, and in France, at all events, a further large increase is contemplated in 1930.These facts are the more surprising when it is remembered that (1) the British Empire, with its far-flung territories, is more dependent on air power than any other nation ; and (2) that we have already made more use than any other nation of the Air Arm as an independent primary weapon, e.g., in Iraq, where its employ-ment has saved many millions since 1922 ; in Transjordan and Palestine; in Homaliland; at Aden; and on the North-West Frontier of India (cf. the Kabul operations laBt winter).
[pact and the Optional Clause, and as an earnest of our good faith and determination to leave no stone unturned to induce other nations to call a halt in the race of air armaments. It will, in fact, be just such a gesture as we urged upon the late Govern-ment when in opposition, and as was recommended in the discussion of a private: Member&apos;s motion on Wednesday, the 4th December. I am bound, however, to warn my colleagues that, so far, there has been no indication of any foreign country following our example, and our forbearance will in many quarters be regarded as :excessive. We canrfot go further unless we are to embark on that policy of extreme unilateral disarmament, which our Front Bench explicitly rejected in the last debate on Air Estimates, * and which was again deprecated, with, particular reference to the Royal Air Force, on all sides of the House in the debate to which I have already alluded.8. Finally, I would point out that the scheme to which the Air Ministry is at present working, allowing for the suggested postponement, could not be curtailed to-day without a complete recasting of the whole organisation. Such a scheme must allow for the proper proportion of squadrons of different types demanded by strategical and tactical requirements, and be based on the requirements of the Air Force for several years ahead. It cannot be truncated without the scrapping of machines already purchased or ordered and the abandonment of aerodrome sites already bought and partly developed and built on, since units would have to be reconstituted, remanned and re-equipped for entirely different functions. Such a course would be wasteful and extravagant in the extreme; it would further derange the whole aircraft industry, whose plant can only be kept going by a steady flow of orders and the absence of violent fluctuations between peak years and years in which their plant would be largely idle and their workmen unemployed.(Initialled) T.Air Ministry, December 5, 1929. .* &quot;The amendment has been either gravely misunderstood or misrepresented by the, Hon. Baronet (Sir Samuel Hoar e). It is not a proposal for unilateral disarmament, it does not suggest that we shoidd reduce our own air force regardless of what is done by other nations.&quot; (Mr. Dallon, Official Report, March 7, 1929, Column 70.) ----- ; --. - v..-\-       .-
