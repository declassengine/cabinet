this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s &quot;government.Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929./ -       a.aSECRET Copy No.CP. 316 J29).CABINET.35CONFERENCE ON THE OPERATION OF DOMINION LEGISLATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.SINCE the Cabinet discussed my memorandum CP. 283 (29) of the22nd October (see Cabinet Conclusions 39 (29), Conclusion 2), the work of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation has made considerable progress.Provisional agreement has been reached with regard to the questions arising&apos; under:  (1.) Disallowance and reservation of Dominion legislation; (2.) Extra-territorial effect for Dominion legislation; and (3.) Merchant shipping.There remain the matters dealt with under (3) (a), (b), (c) and (d) in my memorandum, and a further question which has arisen in regard to Dominion constitutions.   These still present considerable difficulties.I may summarise the present position thus : (a.) Legislation with regard to the Crown.It has been agreed that existing legislation regarding the Crown should be regarded as fundamental.It has been agreed further that the most appropriate description of the legislation in question is &quot;laws relating to the succession to the Throne and the Royal Style and Title,&quot; and I am hopeful of securing unanimity as to a formal agreement being made between the United Kingdom and the Dominions to the effect that the existing laws should remain in operation and be altered only by consent of all members of the Commonwealth.(b.) Certain Aspects of Defence Legislation. It has been agreed (i.) That the principle should be accepted that in all parts of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions the armed forces of any part of the British Commonwealth should carry with them their own code of internal discipline as enacted by their own Legislature, and to that extent should not be subject to local law.(ii.) That a formal agreement should be made between the United Kingdom and the Dominions that legal effect should be given to this principle.(c.) The Laiv of Prize.While there has been no opposition to the view that uniformity of Prize Law and Prize procedure throughout the Empire is essential, and that this uniformity should be provided for by means of formal agreement, the precise scope and form of such agreement has not yet been determined. It may be necessary, therefore, to deal with the matter, so far as the present Conference is concerned, on the basis that there should be further discussion between the Governments before the next Imperial Conference with a view to determining the most appropriate form of agreement [20141]
I have thought it advisable, while maintaining the position that it is necessary for Prize Law throughout the Empire to be regulated by and under legislation of the Parliament at Westminster, not to press the Conference to make a definite recommendation, since political issues are involved, and, moreover, the present time is&apos; not really opportune for the discussion of issues so intimately connected with the question of belligerent rights at sea.(d.) Suggested Empire Court.So far as I can judge, a recommendation is possible that the Imperial Conference should consider the necessity for an Empire Court for the settlement of Inter-Imperial disputes.Granted, however, that the Conference is prepared to recommend that a formal agreement should be concluded to cover the points dealt with under (a) and (b) above, there is still the question what sanction is to be given to such an agreement.As to this, there are two possible alternatives :-(a) that the agreement should be maintained as law by the overriding authority of an Act of the Parliament at Westminster (i.e., whether or not there were concurrent legislation by the Dominion Parliaments) under the continued protection of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, which would continue to apply to this Act alone;(6) that the agreement should be left to rest on its sanctity as an agreement, and should in law depend on concurrent legislation by the several Parliaments (or at any rate the possibility of such legislation), not on the overriding authority of one Parliament.Course (a) has so far been maintained by Sir Maurice Gwyer on my instructions at the meetings of the special Committee which is considering the Colonial Laws Validity Act.It has met with strong criticism from practically all the Dominion representatives on two grounds : (i) that it imposes an express limitation on the powers of Dominion Parliaments, while no such limitation can be imposed on the Parliament at Westminster;(ii) that any such limitation is not only undesirable, but also unnecessary, since an agreement of this nature should be regarded as resting on a higher sanction than that imposed by any law.I feel sure that it would be impossible for me to persuade the present Conference to agree to recommend any course which involves in express terms the limitation of Dominion legislative authority by the operation of an Act of the Parliament at Westminster.Course (b) would be based on the theory that an agreement of this character, which would, of course, provide that it could not be altered without consent, would by its own terms have a sanction superior to that of any law. Further, the acceptance of the agreement by concurrent legislation would be in accordance with the principle of equality of status. This course would probably be accepted by the Dominion delegations, but Sir M. Gwyer has made it plain, on my instructions, that I have so far no authority from the Cabinet to accept, on behalf of the United Kingdom, a report which would put forward such a recommendation.I should be glad to know whether the Cabinet would wTish the Attorney-General and myself to insist further on course (a).If it proves impossible to secure agreement to course (a), should we accept course (&amp;), or, alternatively, since the issues involved are political rather than legal, should we insist that the point should be left over for further consideration by the Governments and at the next Imperial Conference&apos;?Dominion Constitutions.A difficulty has arisen over the position of Dominion Constitutions in the following way. In attempting to set out in outline the form of the legislation which would be required to carry out the general recommendations of the Conference, the Committee under Sir Maurice Gwyer has been considering what provisions will be necessary to safeguard the position of Dominion Constitutions.
In the case of Canada, there is at present no power in Canada to amend the British North America Act, nor is it desired that such power should be given until after further consultation between the Dominion and the Provinces and subject to express safeguards.In the meantime some definite provision is required by Canada to preserve the Constitution unchanged, unless and until it is amended at the request of Canada by a further Act of the Parliament at Westminster.The Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand likewise have no power to amend certain mparts of their Constituent Acts, and they, like Canada, desire that the present position should remain unchanged.Sir M. Grwyer&apos;s first proposal was that the status quo should be preserved by a general clause equally applicable to all Dominion Constitutions.The representatives of the Union of South Africa and of the Irish Free State offered the strongest objections to any such general formula, more particularly the latter, who said that the acceptance of any language implying that their Constitution was subject to Acts of the Parliament at Westminster would be a political impossibility for them.The present position is that the Irish Free State have the power to amend their Constitution in any respect, subject to their obligation not to break the Articles of Agreement; while the Union of South Africa has also a full power of amendment, except that in certain matters a special requirement (a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament sitting together) is necessary.The Irish Free State view is that the sanction of the Articles of Agreement rests on the fact that it is a solemn agreement, and is superior to that imposed by any law; and that it is irrelevant to consider whether the view taken here (which they do not accept) that the Articles of Agreement are binding on them by virtue of an Imperial Act, protected by the Colonial Laws Validity Act, is correct or not.The exact position of the Union of South Africa delegation is not clear. Its representatives on Sir M. Gwyer&apos;s Committee maintain the view that, whether or not the South Africa Act continues to be protected by the Colonial Laws Validity Act, the provisions as to constitutional amendment contained therein are binding by their own force, and could not be altered except by the procedure prescribed for such amendment. Moreover, they indicated that, in their opinion, the Courts in South Africa would hold a similar view. It seems doubtful whether Mr. Beyers, the head of the delegation, shares their opinion. I gather that he regards the Union Constitution as protected only by the Colonial Laws Validity Act (as, indeed, do my own advisers), and desires that that protection should be removed. If Mr. Beyers&apos; opinion is shared by the Union Government, the difficulty, from our point of view, is intensified, having regard to the history of the South Africa Act, and the debates during its passage through the Parliament at Westminster.I should be glad to have the views of the Cabinet as to the line which the Attorney-General and I should take.Should we (a) on the ground of previous pledges and political necessity in relation to the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa, insist on a general formula, to be embodied in legislation, safeguarding the present position as regards Dominion Constitutions; or(6) agree to confine the legislative safeguards to the Dominions which desire them, viz., Canada, Australia and New Zealand; or(c) insist that the point should be left over for further consideration by the Governments and at the next Imperial Conference ?I may add that, if the Cabinet is in favour of course (b), I could endeavour to obtain some form of declaration, embodied possibly in the Report of the present Conference, which would have the effect of emphasising, so far as the Free State and South Africa are concerned, their moral obligation to regard their Constitutions as fundamental and inviolable; but I am far from certain whether I could obtain such a declaration at all, or, if I could, whether it would suffice to disarm Parliamentary criticism here.P.Dominions Office, Downing Street, November 11, 1929.
