Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET.CP. 332 (29).CABINET.THE FULLER EMPLOYMENT OF AIR POWER IN IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Note by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of the Cabinet, a memorandum which Sir Hugh Trenchard has prepared giving his personal views on the highly important question of the future responsibilities of the Royal Air Force.Sir Hugh will relinquish at the end of this year the post of Chief of the Air Staff, which he has now held continuously for more than a decade a critical period, which has seen far-reaching changes in the theory and practice of Imperial Defence. Not the least striking feature of those changes has been the increased utilisation of the Royal Air Force in the Middle East, whereby adequate defence from external aggression has been provided and internal law and order maintained at far less cost than would have been incurred by any other method.*The responsibilities which Sir Hugh suggests should now be transferred to the Royal Air Force from the older services, though considerable, are definitely limited in extent: his paper aims solely at dealing with what he regards as the practical possibilities of to-day.I do not at this stage ask my colleagues to reach any definite conclusion on the details of Sir Hugh&apos;s proposals. In view, however, of the urgent need -for economy in one of the very few directions in which early reductions in expenditure can be effected, I ask that these proposals should be seriously considered as the fruits of his unique and wide experience. Further, I desire strongly to recommend his specific suggestion that an authoritative committee should be appointed forthwith by the Cabinet to review the whole matter.It is on this latter point alone that I now seek a decision, and, if this suggestion is approved in principle, I will in due course formulate proposals, for my colleagues&apos; consideration, as to the form such a committee should take, its composition and terms of reference.T.Air Ministry, November 1929.Copy No.   46* The reductions which have been effected in Defence expenditure in those areas in which the Eoyal Air Force has taken over control are really remarkable see paragraph 12 (page 2) of Sir Hugh&apos;s memorandum. For example, the cost of garrisoning Iraq to-day is but 15 per cent, of the.official estimate put forward for the cost of &quot;ground&quot; as opposed to &quot;air&quot; control at the time it was decided to institute the latter. In Palestine and Transjordan the corresponding figure is even more striking, being less than 10 per cent. Of course, it would be too much to hope for reductions anything approaching this scale in the new areas now brought under review.It seems almost unbelievable that recent incidents in Palestine should be thought to have any bearing on the efficacy of air control, but since, to my surprise, there does seem to be a quite groundless misapprehension in some quarters, it may be worth while to recall that in the riots of 1921, when Palestine was garrisoned by 3 infantry battalions and 3 cavalry regiments with ancillaries, making a total ration strength of 13,000, there were notwithstanding no less than 330 casualties amongst the civil population. I should also yjerhaps underline the references to this subject in paragraphs 17 and 18 (page 3) of the memorandum. Sir Hugh remarks that &quot; the Air Staff have never contended that air action is an instrument well suited to intervene in aid of the civil power in towns.&apos;&apos;&apos; The Air Staff have, indeed, for years past been at pains to make the contrary view quite clear in printed memoranda and other documents, with quotations from which I will not, however, trouble my colleagues. But more pertinent is Sir Hugh&apos;s reminder that neither military nor air forces can be a satisfactory substitute for police forces in coping with the early stages of civil disorder.[20059a]   [21278]
SECRET.THE FULLER EMPLOYMENT OF AIR POWER IN IMPERIAL DEFENCE.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF.Air Control, 1919-1929.Secretary of State,1. WHEN I began to consider nearly twelve years ago the effect of the advent of air power upon our Imperial Defence commitments and how we should best make provision to meet changed conditions, I early became convinced that if the new and heavy burden of air defences necessary to meet the new clangers had to be superimposed as an additional burden upon our already very heavy outlay for Naval and Military purposes the cost would be prohibitive, and that some solution must be found more adapted to our strained financial resources.2. I considered that we could, and should, use the air forces which had in any event to be provided for defence in the new element to undertake other responsibilities as well in substitution for existing land and sea forces which could not by their nature carry out a dual role. My arguments were developed in March 1921 in C.I.D. Paper old. Psj No. 135-C, in which I outlined several of the various roles in which I considered No i35-&apos; that; substitution of air forces for land and sea forces would be practicable. In putting forward the views then expressed I may have appeared, and I may now appear, as I fully appreciate, to over-estimate the capacities of the Air and to under-value the roles of the Navy and Army respectively in the organisation of our National and Imperial Defences as a whole. I wish most definitely to disclaim any such intention. 8In dealing with the substitution of Air Power, it is natural that one should concentrate on those fields of defence responsibility where the possibilities of substitution exist, but there remain, and always will remain, so far as I can make any claim to judge, fundamental defence responsibilities that can be discharged only by the Navy and Army, and in which air power, where it can be employed at all, would only be used in auxiliary and minor capacities. I hope this, will be borne in mind at all times when any of the proposals contained in the present memorandum are under consideration.3. Even, however, by 1921, I was convinced that air power, at all events, could supply the best possible means, provided it was correctly applied, for the effective, economic and humane control of undeveloped countries; and I urged that, as a first step towards the proof of this and my several other contentions, the R.A.F. should be given the primary responsibility for the control of some area in the Middle East.4. In August 1921 the proposals put forward by the Air Ministry for the Iraq, control of Iraq were accepted, and, after careful preparation, put into full operation in October 1922. They were accepted as an experiment, and in the face of views widely held that the result could only be disastrous; that our prestige throughout Egypt, the Middle East and India would be irreparably tarnished; and that we should find ourselves involved in formidable relief operations and expenditure on a. vast scale.5. It can, indeed, be admitted that at the time of its inauguration conditions were in many respects adverse to a new method of control, to the power of which the tribes were unaccustomed, with its accompaniment of wholesale reductions in the visible forces available, and therefore, to the minds of the tribesmen, of their striking power. The immediate situation at Mosul and in Kurdistan was unfavourable, and was growing worse. There were many other adverse factors. The lack of a peace treaty with Turkey, the prior conclusion of which had been one of the axioms on which the Air scheme of control had originally been framed, together with the very disturbing conditions on the Turkish frontier joining Iraq, the progressive reductions then being made in the subsidies paid to the Desert Sheikhs, the unsettled conditions prevailing in Syria and internally in Palestine and Transjordan, and the necessity under financial duress to bring about the change-over in a minimum of time, all combined to render the task more difficult. [20059]   [21278] b
6. Air Control in Iraq nevertheless quickly justified itself, and more than fulfilled the expectations held out by those who had urged its adoption. The method of air control in that country stands to-day demonstrated by seven years of practical experience under divers conditions, and its success is admitted even in quarters which were most disposed to be critical of its inception. Security and order in the country have steadily progressed, while our military commitments, measured alike in numbers or in expenditure, have been steadily reduced, as will be seen by reference to Appendix I to the present memorandum.7. In 1922 a scheme of air control was also adopted in Trans Jordan, and with results proportionately no less successful than those attained on a larger scale in Iraq. &apos; Since the adoption of the scheme successive reductions have been made in the forces provided at its outset, and this despite the fact that the local governments have pursued a forward policy and consolidated their administration in frontier districts and in inaccessible areas in which it had previously been found impossible for any Government to maintain effective authority. Figures showing the reductions effected are given in paragraph 12 below.8. The next and, up to the present, latest area in which air control has been adopted was Aden, where, as a result of the experience gained in the Middle East, it was decided in 1928 to substitute air forces for military forces as the primary arm of control. The situation in the Aden hinterland had been deteriorating for several vears, and to right it by means of a military expedition would, in the view expressed ifewlS&quot; &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 738-B, paragraph 10), have &quot;* &apos; required reinforcements of the approximate strength of a division, and would have involved expenditure amounting, at their estimate, to between 6 and 10 million pounds. Operations on that scale would have continued over many months, and would have entailed perhaps numerous casualties and inevitably many losses through exposure and disease. In the event the situation was restored by the correct applica-tion of air power in a few months by one squadron operating at the most unfavourable weather period for a cnst of about  8.500 and without a single casualty to our forces by enemy action.9. Trade routes are now being opened out into the hinterland where the state of order is greatly improved, and although formal peace terms with the Imam of Yemen are not yet concluded, the situation is highly satisfactory. Within the last two years the garrison has been reduced by the withdrawal of two infantry battalions and the Aden troop of Cavalry, a small force of about 200 native levies being substituted in their place.10. This substitution at Aden is important as constituting a definite step forward in that the air forces were made responsible not merely for the control of the protectorate, but also for the command of the fortress and its defence against seaborne attack.11. In the face of the evidence, which has thus accumulated during the last eight years of air operations carried out under every different condition of climate, of country and of flying weather which are to be found.between the Sudan and Kabul, the efficacy of air power for employment in undeveloped countries cannot any longer be disputed. The claims advanced by the Air Staff are solidly based upon practical experience and have been subjected to extensive and exacting test under all conditions over a disturbed period of several years.12. The economies to be effected by the fuller employment of air forces rest upon an equally sure foundation of achievement, as the table appended amply proves.Approximate Figures of Defence Expenditure.i.    &apos; - -Military, - Air Force Estimate preMnt Cost,1921-22, for Cost of AirScheme.

The value of the air units in Trans Jordan and Palestine should not be reckoned only in terms of their utility for the defence of those countries. Owing to the mobility of the air arm they provide in emergency reinforcements for other areas and can thus be taken into account in fixing air requirements as a whole.The Afghanistan (Relief of Legations) operations were partly carried out by aircraft sent by air from Iraq 2,500 miles away and replaced in that country by air reinforcements-from Egypt, which is 860 miles distant from Iraq.13. It will be seen that in each case the savings actually effected by air control since the scheme was established have far exceeded those promised in the original estimate. The claims put forward by the Air Staff have been shown in the event in each case to have been remarkably conservative.The Meaning of &quot;Air Control&quot; and &quot;Substitution.&apos;&apos;&apos; 14.   Air control in a semi-civilised country implies (1.) That the primary role when formal operations have to be carried out is undertaken by air forces in substitution for mobile military columns;(2.) That all forces are under the control of an air officer, since experience has shown that only in this way can their correct employment in accordance with the views of the Air Staff be ensured;(3.) That the establishments and landing grounds are protected and order maintained in towns, &amp;c, by ground forces which may be either Imperial infantry, armoured forces, armed police or levies, the Imperial infantry units being maintained on a basis of local mobility only. Economies are effected by reduction of the number of infantry and artillerjr units of the garrison, and consequent reduction in ancillary services and field supply units: and by a reduction of the immense transport provision which need no longer be retained if mobile columns are not employed.15. &quot;Substitution&quot; therefore by no means implies that the employment of land and/or sea forces is thereby eliminated. Every scheme of air control requires the co-operation of some land or sea forces or both, their type and organisation varying according to the particular conditions of each scheme.16. These conditions, as for instance in Iraq, Trans Jordan or Aden, and, as I firmly believe, on the North West Frontier of India, and elsewhere also, may be such that the most suitable form of armed force to employ when ultimately necessary is air action, assisted by armoured cars or detachments of regular or irregular forces employed to protect the landing grounds, &amp;c. These are the conditions most appropriate to the working of air control.17. The Air Staff, on the other hand, have never contended that air action is an instrument well suited to intervene in aid of the civil power in towns.18. An example may be derived from Palestine and Transjordan. In Trans Jordan, a country of scattered populations and poor communications, con-ditions are well suited for air control; that is to say, the primary arm on which authority and security rests is air power, assisted by armoured cars and irregular forces.In Palestine, on the other hand, the focal points of unrest are found in more closely compact centres of population. Insurance against racial or political upheavals in such conditions is to be found neither in aircraft nor artillery, nor in infantry battalions, but in police and gendarmerie forces of adequate size and quality, properly trained in the use of small arms and well supplied with mechanical transport. The recent disorders in Palestine are now under review by the Commission appointed for their investigation, and it is unnecessary here to do more than observe that grave risks are incurred, as events have shown, if political considerations or the desire to reduce expenditure are allowed unduly to affect the provision of public security forces. No military or air garrison can be a substitute for, or render superfluous, police forces trained and equipped according to the degree of lawlessness which is latent in the particular community concerned, and against which it is a primary duty of Government to provide adequate insurance.Further Substitution now Practicable.19.   Substitution started in the Middle East as a process of practical trial, and was subsequently extended in the course of search for further economies as separate [20059] b 2
individual occasions arose. It was recognised from the first that the substitution carried out in the Middle East was the preliminary trial of a process which, when it had proved itself, should be more widely extended.20. No considered plan, however, has as yet been formulated for the systematic and progressive extension of air control in our system of Imperial Defence as a whole.21. I contend that the case for air control has now been fully proved, that our Imperial Defence arrangements should be extensively overhauled and our methods&apos; modernised, and that the new and improved form of control which air power provides should be used as the means of effecting considerable economies in defence expenditure and reduction in armaments, and of keeping order without having to maintain large mobile military forces and from time to time to embark on long-drawn-out military operations.22. It is, moreover, undoubtedly the case that informed opinion in all quarters as the result, in particular, of the emphatic and universally admitted success of the air arm in Iraq is now ready to consider favourably a wider general extension of the use of air power in Imperial Defence as a means of effecting with safety large reductions in armaments and expenditure. (See statements made from all sides of the House of Commons in the debates on Air Estimates, of which extracts are given in Appendix II.)23. Would it not, therefore, now be possible for the Government to set up a Committee to examine the possibilities of further substitutions of air power in Imperial Defence and to formulate a policy of substitution which could be put into effect gradually and over a period, say, of the next ten years? No less time would be adequate for carrying out any comprehensive and well-ordered programme.24. It must, of course, be expected that any proposals which would be submitted by the Air Staff in this regard would meet with searching criticism from the older services. Such criticism would be welcome, as I recognise that the closest examina-tion from every aspect of any proposals would be a necessary precedent to the formulation of a policy which could be adopted and maintained not merely by one, but by successive Governments.The further Commitments which Air Power should now take over25. It may meanwhile be of service to you in considering the proposal I have made for the setting up of a committee to investigate this question, if I briefly outline some specific proposals for further substitutions to be carried out progressively during the next few years. I have therefore prepared and attach a supplementary memorandum which indicates under various headings the additional responsibilities ] which, in my own definite opinion after nearly twelve years&apos; experience, could now be undertaken by air power, together with further proposals for other responsibilities which might be undertaken later on. These schemes can obviously, at present, only be presented in broad outline, and detailed plans would have to be prepared later [ following local investigation in each case by senior air officers.26. The proposals outlined in the supplementary memorandum are as] follows : Air Control on the North West Frontier of India Substitution of air forces for naval forces for routineduties in the Persian Gulf Air Control of the Sudan Air Control in British East Africa   ... substitution in the West African Colonies Air Forces in Coast Defence...The substitution of air forces for naval forces for routine duties in the Red SeaSection	I.Section	II.Section	III.Section	IV.Section	V.Section	VI.Section	VIIAir Ministry, November 1929.H.

ISOSUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM OUTLINING VARIOUS SCHEMESOF AIR CONTROL.SECTION I.Air Control on the North-West Frontier of India,1.   I consider that the time is now ripe to begin the substitution of air control for the present military control of the North-West Frontier.Previous Proposals for Employment of Air Power in Indian Warfare,2.   Previous proposals were put forward in 1922 in connection with the Indian Military Requirements Committee :- (i.) The Air Staffs proposals were that reductions might be effected in the Field Army in India by allotting to the air forces, suitably increased, the primary role in a war against Afghanistan.Sir John Salmond was deputed to India to examine the problem, and he, in addition to endorsing the proposal (i) above, recommended that: (ii.) Responsibility for the control of a part of the North-West Frontier should be transferred from military to air forces to afford a practical test of the contentions of the Air Staff as to the efficacy and economy of air power for the control of semi-civilized peoples.It is to this second aspect of the Indian Defence problem that the present paper refers.The View of the Government of India upon Sir John Salmond&apos;s Recommendations.3. Sir John Salmond&apos;s proposals for an increase in Air Forces, with corresponding reductions in the Field Army, received the unanimous support of the Viceroy&apos;s Council with the exception of the Commander-in-Chief, who expressed himself as unable to agree to any substitution by the Royal Air Force for any part of the existing Field Army in offensive operations against Afghanistan. Even he, however, professed himself willing to agree to a practical test of air control on the frontier, but only with the proviso that its cost should not be borne by Army funds. Under this condition the scheme for air control could not be put into effect.4. It will be realised that at the time these recommendations were put forward in 1922 air control had not yet been established in Iraq and Transjordan, and the experience of air power as a primary arm which has since been obtained was not then available in support of the Air Staff proposals.5. The C.-in-C, India, in his comments on Sir John Salmond&apos;s report, stated &quot;. ... it is essential that we should be aware of the results of the new policy in Iraq before we agree to any definite change here in India. We may hope that, if the results in Iraq are satisfactory, we may benefit by their experiments and carry out economies in our military expenditure here in. the same way that the Colonial Office propose doing in Iraq.&quot;He also said : &quot; I am unable, therefore, to agree to any change in composition of the Field Army or to any serious alteration in our policv for the defence of the North-West Frontier when such changes are based on nothing more reliable than pure conjecture.&quot;&quot;If, as time goes on and the air policy in Iraq and Palestine prove really ibid.,p.6, successful, and if our experience in Waziristan justifies in the future more 1*&quot;-&quot;* confidence than we at present possess in air operations generally, I shall be prepared to reconsider my attitude towards this question.&quot;
Experience of Air Control obtained since 1922.6. Since these views were expressed in 1922, our knowledge of the potentialities of air power has been placed on a footing of definite achievement as shown in the first part of this Memorandum.7. Moreover, it is clear that the Government of India is coming round to the views of the Air Staff, for instance, in evidence to the Persian Gulf Committee of the C.I.D. in November 1928 (8th Minutes), Sir Denys Bray, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, stated : &quot;. . . . India is, of course, intensely concerned with the application of air power to the development of tribal policy. We have proceeded with it on the North-West Frontier slowly, perhaps, but very surely, and our successes there open up an assured prospect of its successful application in other parts of the Frontier.&quot;Scope of the Present Proposals.8. I advocate that air control should now be substituted for the present military control of the North-West Frontier by the Covering Troops; the districts to be transferred being Peshawar, Kohat, Waziristan, Zhob and Baluchistan.9. It is realised that the air forces now in the Frontier Zone are also required to carry out certain tasks under the War Plan of the Government of India and my proposals make provision accordingly.10. No proposals are put forward in the present paper to change the role of the Field Army under the War Plan, and the present scheme has been framed on the assumption that the existing plan for a military advance will stand intact. *11. No changes, again, are proposed in the forces at present allotted for internal security.Role of the Covering Troops which it is proposed to transfer.12.   The Army in India is organized on the basis of providing : (i.) Internal Security Troops, (ii.^ Covering Troops, (iii.) Field Army.This organization is framed to undertake-^ either a war against Afghanistan,or a major operation in some part of the Frontier Zone, but not both.My proposals affect only the functions at present allotted to Covering Troops.13.   Under the present organization the Covering Troops undertake the general control of the Frontier Zone as a whole, whilst the Field Army carries out either-(a) a major operation in any part of the Frontier Zone, or (6) an advance into Afghanistan in accordance with the plan adopted and maintained by the Army in India for a war against Afghanistan.14. It must be clearly realised that any major tribal uprising necessitates the employment of the Field Army, while tribal disturbances on even a relatively moderate scale may require the employment of at any rate a part of it. These statements are based on the Plan of Operations issued by the General Staff in India.* This must not, however, be taken to imply agreement with that plan. See on this the views expressed by me in 1922 (C.I.D. 123-A). This aspect of the Indian Defence Problem is regarded as outside the scope of the present paper.
Outline of the Scheme.15. For the mobile column operations of the Covering Troops, with their vulnerable lines of communication, heavy casualties, high sick rate, wholesale destruction of- property and immense expenditure, the scheme I advocate would substitute air operations, carried out from peace stations, gaining their results mainly by moral effect and rapidity of action, and with the minimum of casualties to either side, of destruction and expense.16. In the present paper no detailed particulars can be given of the changes in composition and disposition of the forces. In general outline, however, my proposals would be as follows : (i.) The Internal Security Forces would remain unchanged, (ii.) The Field Army would remain unchanged, and the present proposals would provide for it the requisite air co-operation.(iii.) All political centres, all towns in exposed positions and places of importance from the point of view of prestige, and all aerodromes and landing grounds from which air operations might normally be under-taken, would retain military garrisons of regular troops. At the most important of these light artillery would also be retained.(iv.) The Scouts and Frontier Constabulary would remain unchanged, (v.) It would be an essential feature of the scheme, based on previous experience, that all forces allotted to the Frontier Zone should be under the command of an Air Officer Commanding, acting directly with the political authorities.(vi.) It would be strongly recommended that the present policy of opening up the country by the provision of roads should continue and at not less than its present rate. The details, however, of present road projects might be varied after examination in India in cases where solely strategic ends as opposed to those of economic development are served. In view of the great saving under the Air Scheme in purely military expenditure, there should be less difficulty than at present in finding the cost of road-making and other works, such as irrigation, which serve to develop the scanty economic resources of the frontier areas. It should be the aim, however, to lay out the expenditure for productive rather than for strategic ends.17. It will be appreciated from the preceding paragraph that the Air proposals are framed on a conservative basis, and that the regular military forces retained are relatively larger than those which have hitherto been found necessary for similar projects. This is in accord with the policy of the Government of India that any changes in Frontier Defence policy should only be made most carefully and gradually. Due account, moreover, has been taken of the view expressed in India that the North-West Frontier constitutes a problem in control much more difficult than those which the R.A.F. has undertaken elsewhere.18. While I do not regard these apprehensions as valid, I nevertheless recognise that they are sincerely entertained, and I am anxious to meet them and satisfy them. My intention is that the air scheme shall be founded on a basis so firm and conservative that no apprehensions that it would entail any undue risk could reasonably persist.Savings made possible by the Air Proposals.19. At the present stage no details can be given of the various reductions and increases which the scheme I advocate would entail. An initial general examination of the problem indicates that there would be reductions of from 25 to 30 battalions (almost entirely Indian battalions) and some 10 batteries of artillery, besides relative ieductions in Headquarters and Administrative units, establishments and services, against an increase of 5 or 6 air squadrons with relative controlling and administrative increases.20. The savings to be effected would be of the order of 2 million pounds annually, whilst the capital outlay required to complete the whole scheme would be about 1 million pounds.
21. The above indications do not refer to the ultimate savings possible, but only to those to be effected in the first and interim stage. Further reductions may be found feasible in later years.22. These estimates, of course, do not, and cannot, include any figure for those savings which would result from the carrying out of any necessary operations by air forces instead of by columns. These, as experience in Iraq, at Aden and on the North-West Frontier itself has already shown, would be on a large scale.Relation of the Scheme to the Organization in India for External Defence.23. As indicated in paragraph 10 above, the Air Staff have never signified their agreement with the present plan of war against Afghanistan. On the assumption, however, that it stands as the plan adopted by the Government of India and as the basis of India&apos;s military organization and expenditure it is relevant to draw attention to the substantial contributions to security against external aggression, which would be derived from the Air Scheme which I advocate.24.   These are summarised below : (i.) Diminished Risk of Field Army being deflected to Frontier Control.: Any serious disturbance in the Frontier Zone entails under the present organization the calling in of the Field Army, either in whole or in part, and may thus vitiate the carrying out of the plan of war against Afghanistan. Under the present Scheme the control secured would be more effective and complete.t(ii.) Increase in Air Striking Power.The adoption of the scheme of air control would place at the immediate disposal of the Government of India a direct increase of more than 50 per cent, over their present striking power in the Air.It is a great advantage of Air Power that it can be turned rapidly from one front and from one objective to another. Its strength can be apportioned as required at any time against one or more of several objectives. Even the presence of the aircraft.overhead on passage to another objective has a valuable steadying effect.Thus air forces which are available for instant use in tribal control can, without changing their normal locations, be turned in their full strength against objectives in Afghanistan and have a steadying effect upon the tribes over whom their flights are made.This increase in Air striking power is incontestably a great asset, whether the view that the air offensive will be a decisive factor be accepted or not. Offensive action by air is our first means of striking a blow at Afghanistan; the only means at our disposal which can be employed without immense expenditure and a long, arduous and hazardous campaign; and the only blow which can be delivered against Kabul itself for six months.(iii.) Improvements made possible in Field Army.The scheme of air control would also make possible an improvement in the organization and equipment of the Field Army itself and render it better fitted to carry out the approved plan and to discharge the acknowledged liabilities of the Government of India.Indeed the Air Scheme offers the only possible means of meeting the two urgent but conflicting needs of India, reduction of military expenditure and improvement of defensive resources.Reduced Liability of the Home Government.25. The scheme would also redound to the advantage of the Home Government. It is inevitable that any deficiencies in the defence resources of the Government of India have in an emergency to be made good by the Home Government, even though the contingency is one for which the Indian Government accepts responsibility. For instance, the Plan of War against Afghanistan, although this^ war is an Indian Defence problem, requires extensive reinforcements in men, animals and material
from Home.* The Home Government in.effect shoulders an indefinite liability to make good at the outbreak.of war or major operations on the Frontier a great deal which it is the responsibility of India to provide, but which she has not been able to provide. The Home Government has thus a direct interest in any measures whicbj will render the. Army in.India better fitted to its tasks.26.   The attitude of the Home Government has been thus expressed: &quot;2. His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully alive to the gravity of the financial ^^ jg&quot; situation in India, and are impressed by the imperative need for making all p^a. 2. &apos; possible retrenchments in every branch of the administration. It is thought necessary, however, to observe that it is the primary duty of the Government of India, as of all Governments, to make adequate provision for the defence of its territory and the protection of life and property within its boundaries.-Moreover, the moment when India has been accorded a new status within the Empire is not an appropriate time for her to ask for relief from the military obligations, which are inseparable from that status. Approval cannot, there-fore, be given to a reduction of the Army in India to an establishment which would in effect throw upon Great Britain the obligation of providing reinforce-ments to meet such minor emergencies as must inevitably arise from time to time. On the other hand, the figures which have been produced have shown the high proportion which the net military expenditure bears to the net revenue; and it is recognised that a point may be reached in any country beyond which military expenditure cannot be increased without creating some of the very dangers it is intended to avert, and that when that point is reached the Civil Government may have to undertake the responsibility of over-ruling its military advisers.&quot;Conclusion:3. While the whole of the resources of Britain will in the future, as in the past, be available to support the Government of India in maintaining British supremacy in India if it is seriously threatened, it is the recognised duty of India to provide for her own.defence against external and internal dangers in all but the gravest emergencies.27.&quot; The- adoption of Air Control in substitution for the Covering Troops would enable the Army in India to effect certain improvements in the Field Army. For instance, certain shortages in personnel could be alleviate!&apos;:by transfers from the disbanded units;- military equipment- of every kind, including in particular transport, would be released to increase the equipment of the Field Army and render it more mobile. Money wrould become available for increasing the provision of armoured forces or transport or other requirements by which the advance to Kabul, if it should become necessary; could be carried through more rapidly and the campaign brought to an earlier close.&apos;28.   The following extract from a memorandum by Sir Basil Blackett is relevant: &quot; It is. an admitted fact that the reduction in the size of the Army in 1923 ^J&apos;pf0^r has been followed by an all-round improvement in efficiency, and that in more p06. &apos;*  &apos; than one instance previous. deficiencies in the personnel and material of the Striking Forces, have been remedied as the direct result of the disbandment of other Units.&quot;The Maintenance in Afghanistan of. a Will to Peace.29.   The; Air scheme would also, provide a powerful, factor making for a peaceful tendency on the part of Afghanistan and the.trans-frontier tribes.30. War by Afghanistan herself against India, or trouble stirred up by her upon our borders,. is, likely to have its origin in Kabul or other centre, and-almost certainly,at,the initiative of an individual,31. This initiative is likely to be taken only for ends of personal advantage, real or supposed. Personal vanity might, for instance,&apos;be such a.reason;.or instiga-tion by another foreign Power/ ;* See C.I.D,.

It is, however, far less likely to be taken so long as the ruler in Kabul remains aware that the first and immediate result of a declaration of war will be that his Fort, treasury, arsenal and the barracks of his bodyguard will be laid in ruins. In this connection it is worthy of note that the bombing of Kabul by a single Handley Page machine in 1919 was regarded by the then Commander-in-Chief as an important factor in producing the desire for peace at the Headquarters of the Afghan Government (General Sir C. C. Monro&apos;s despatch on Operations against Afghanistan : &quot; London Gazette.&quot; the 12th March, 1920).33. The military advance through a hostile Afghanistan takes, according to the approved plan, some 180 days to reach Kabul; by air it takes less than one-half that number of minutes, and the flights can be made at a few hours&apos; notice independent of seasons. This fact that Kabul is now under two hours instead of six months distant from British forces must have become well understood during the early winter months of this year, when the troop carriers and other aircraft were flying almost daily to Kabul. So long as this fact remains clear in the mind of the ruler in Kabul, it is likely to be a decisive factor in the maintenance of peace.34. Memory, however, is apt to be short, and it would be a cardinal mistake if we were to allow this great lesson to be forgotten. The whole situation vis-a-vis Afghanistan has been changed profoundly by these evacuations. To keep this lesson in the minds of the Afghans, both at Kabul itself and on the road to Kabul, as an insurance to peace, deserves the most careful consideration of the Government of India.35. To this end a portion of the economies to be.effected under the Air Scheme should be set aside to implement, when opportunity again arises, the project for a Civil Air Service to Kabul (described in C.I.D. Paper No. D.I. 28), to which great importance was attached by the Defence of India Sub-Committee. There can be no doubt of its great value as a factor for peace in the light of the recent air evacuation.36. When a Legation is again established at Kabul it should also include an Air Attache.Summary of Recommendations.37. (i.) Air control should be substituted on the North-West Frontier for the present military control by the Covering Troops, the districts to be transferred being Peshawar, Kohat, Waziristan, Zhob and Baluchistan.(ii.) The Air Scheme would be framed on most carefully conservative lines, so that no risks of depleting the defence resources on the frontier unduly or too suddenly could reasonably arise.(iii.) Internal Security troops would remain unchanged.(iv.) The Field Army would remain unchanged and the air tasks required for it would be provided under the scheme. There would be certain advantages and improvements in the external defence resources of India to be obtained from the adoption of the Air Staff proposals : (a.) Over 50 per cent, increase in Air Striking Power.(6.) The more effective control of Frontier thus obtained would reduce the present likelihood that the Plan of war may be vitiated by the necessity to deflect part or all of the Field Army to reinforce the Covering Troops.(c.) The resources in personnel and equipment of the Field Army could be improved and the Field Army made more rapidly^mobile, so that the Plan of War could be carried through and the operations brought to a close at an earlier stage.(d.) Consequent on (c), the present risk that the Home Government would have to supply and maintain in the Field considerable reinforcements of land and air forces and equipment essential for the existing approved plan of war would be reduced.(v.) Scouts and Frontier Constabulary would remain unchanged.(vi.) All political centres, towns and aerodromes would retain regular garrisons.(vii.) It is an essential feature of the scheme that all forces allotted to the Frontier Zone shall be under the command of an Air Officer Commanding acting directly with the political authorities.(viii.) There would be reductions in military forces of some 25 to 30 battalions, mostly Indian, and some 10 batteries, and increases in the air forces of 5 or b squadrons, with relative administrative reductions and increases.  This rearrange-
a si) &amp;y JL ti c5ment would effect an annual saving of the order of about 2 million pounds on a total capital outlay for the complete scheme, spread over several years, of about 1 millionfiounds. After the interim scheme had been firmly established and tried out, some further reductions might be found feasible in later years.(ix.) The present policy of opening up and developing the country with roads, irrigation schemes, &amp;c, should certainly continue, but the details of existing schemes might be varied.(x.) A Civil Air Service to Kabul should be established when opportunity arises from a portion of the savings effected by the Air Scheme in order to maintain a will to peace in Afghanistan and to keep in mind the lesson taught by the air evacuations from Kabul.(xi.) When conditions are again suitable, an Air Attache should be appointed to Kabul.Conclusion.38. The above proposals are a preliminary outline only of a scheme which would have in due course to be elaborated by the Air Staff and examined in detail in India by a Senior Air Officer with the necessary technical assistance.i[20059]
The Routine Duties at present carried out in the Gulf.3.   The duties undertaken by the sloops are in general terms:  (i.) Anti-slavery patrols, (ii.) Arms traffic patrols.(iii.) Conveyance of the Resident and Political Officers, (iv.) &quot; Showing the Flag.&quot; (v.) Operations; consisting mainly of :  .(a.) Arrival on the scene of disturbance for moral effect. (b.) The landing of an armed party of up to about 50 men. (c.) In the last resort bombardment of such objectives as can be reached from the sea.These duties are described below.Anti-Slavery Patrol.O.I.D. Papar 4.   &quot; The slave traffic is now relatively unimportant.&quot;   Our treaties and special^&quot;ile^&apos;18&apos;   rations &quot;with the sheikhs on the Arabian shore are adequate, if strictly interpreted, p&apos;    &apos;        and it is in that way, and not by the interception of dhows at sea, that the slave traffic is held in check. *c.i.D. Paper 5.   For instance, our control over the traffic at Koweit is effective throughWo. p.o. is, political and administrative means, although we have no formal agreement with the p&quot;13.&apos;        Sheikh of Koweit to search his dhows.6. &quot;When the organization for an air route and its intermediate stopping-places has been completed, our political control over the Sheikhs will be far more effective, and our hold over the slave traffic correspondingly more complete than at present.7. Moorings and landing grounds once established, the political officer&apos;s personal influence will be brought to bear everywhere, both in coastal villages, at present cut off from communications, to which slaves in small parties can be smuggled with little chance of detection by us, and also in the Hinterland, where slaves can be taken by caravan without fear of interception.8. Aircraft can cover in a few days&apos; patrol thousands of miles and reconnoitre with a wide horizon. Their speed is so great that their movements cannot be espied or forecasted by interested parties. They can arrive as a surprise from a great distance, and can reconnoitre alike creeks and lagoons, shallow channels and inland routes. There can be no hope for a dhow master that he can lie up concealed from an aircraft while awaiting a suitable wind or darkness, or that he can outdistance or evade an aircraft which is pursuing him.Substitution of Air Forces for Naval Forces for Routine duties in the Persian Gulf.  -The Naval Forces, available in the. Persian Gulf..1. H.M. Sloops in the Persian Gulf are part of the East Indies Squadron. There are four light vessels of sloop class in the squadron, and in normal times two or three sloops are at any one time in the Gulf itself carrying out routine naval duties.2. There are also three cruisers in the East Indies Squadron, and one of these is usually present where any serious situation arises. These cruisers would, of course, still be available if the routine duties in the Gulf were undertaken by air forces instead of by sloops. Their duties and the area of the East Indies station are such that normally one of these three is near enough to be available at a few days&apos; notice.
9. Flying boats armed with a light gun and machine guns and operating in pairs should have no&apos;difficulty in dealing with a dhow, particularly if either or both of the flying boats were of the troop carrier design to which the flying-boat type of aircraft lends itself specially well. Slaves, however, no longer arrive wholesale in boat-loads, but are smuggled across two or three at a time among other cargo, which makes the identification and capture of slaves far more difficult. Of recent times our influence with the Sheikhs has increased, and, with the develop-ment of the air route alojig the Arabian shore, will increase far more; and under the changed conditions to-day the method which is mainly effective in the suppression of such slave traffic as remains is that of control on shore rather than that of interception at sea.   Air power will make this control far closer.Arms Traffic.10.   &quot;The problem at the present day is one of inconsiderable dimensions.&quot; ^,p-j?aJ)*r We have treaty engagements with the various Sheikhs and with Persia, and p 0i54&apos;. &apos;13&apos; the means by which suppression of the traffic is mainly effected under present conditions are political:pressure and surveillance on shore.   These means prove a satisfactory deterrent.11. Armed action at sea to prevent the traffic is not in practice effective. At one time in 1912-13 we carried out a regular blockade of the Mekran coast with warships and armed launches without preventing arms being landed, though the prices were run up. As with the slave trade, the arms traffic has been reduced to its small proportions by political pressure upon the Sheikhs. With the development of our air power this pressure will be even more effective.12. Moreover, as air.power becomes more extensively used as the main instru-merit for the control of uncivilised regions, the rifle in the hands of the tribesman will be a far less useful weapon against us, and the problem therefore will tend to solve itself.Conveyance of the Resident and Political Officers.13. Air communication will enable the political officers to keep in far closer touch with their spheres of responsibility than they can by sea. Under present Conditions a three days&apos; visit to Muscat by Resident, Persian Gulf, entails nineteen clays&apos; absence from his headquarters, and it is thus only very rarely that he is able to visit the more distant portions of the area under his charge. The same visit carried out by flying boat could be performed in less than a week. A flying boat could be summoned overnight by the Resident and convey him the next day to Koweit, Bahrein or Qatar; and to Muscat and Sur the day after.Showing the Flag.14. Air forces are an ideal instrument for showing the flag, particularly in semi-civilized regions. It must not be overlooked that, if it should be necessary, air forces can show the flag far inland as well as on the coast itself, and can reach the spot at the shortest notice. When any emergency arises which calls for action, the real fountain head of the trouble is almost invariably inland. As an instance, the detention of Colonel Jacobs&apos; mission to the Yememin 1919 may be quoted. The Commission was incarcerated in the Hinterland during negotiations, and their release was effected after an air demonstration had been carried out. An &quot;incident &quot; culminating in the necessity for an expedition would in all probability have been the alternative.There can be no question that the ability of aircraft to penetrate, if necessary, into the interior to the real source of the trouble constitutes them the most powerful as well as the most immediate and economical instrument possible for showing the flag. *Operations.15. Air Forces can reach the scene of possible disturbances at the shortest notice. They can strike at objectives in-shore and penetrate far into the Hinterland. Their attribute of swiftness and surprise adds greatly to their direct military efficacy.  They are cheap to apply.  Air forces, therefore, are a most effective means
of control of these regions. If major disturbances arose which called for rapid evacuation of the European population other Air Forces of suitable class could be summoned from Iraq. For such major disturbances, however, one or more cruisers are, under the present conditions, available and would equally be available if the routine duties in the Gulf were carried out by Air Force.The Strategic Air Route.i 16. It must also be remembered that some Air Forces are, in any event, required in the Gulf for the development and security of our strategic air route along the Arabian shore. Air Forces are necessary for this task, and the most suitable class of aircraft for this purpose on this section of the strategic air route with its long oversea passage between Muscat and the Baluchistan coast is the flying boat.Air Forces to carry out the routine duties in the Gulf,17. A Flying Boat Squadron is at present stationed at Basra, and, suitably increased and equipped, could, in my opinion, undertake the routine duties in the Gulf.  The squadron should be in direct touch with the political authorities., The cost of the maintenance of the sloops is in part defrayed from the grant-in-aid of  100,000 paid by the Indian Government.The Provision of the Air Forces required in the Gulf in war.&apos; 18. . The arguments put forward in paragraphs 3-18 relate to the substitution of flying boats for sloops in the Persian Gulf in peace. It must not be overlooked, however, that, in any event, flying boats will be necessary in the Gulf at the outbreak of a major war either in the Middle or the Far East.19. Communications across Persia to the Gulf are being steadily developed. In less than ten years the railway from the Caspian Sea to the Gulf may be finished. A civil air service already connects Moscow with Bushire, and flying facilities are also available elsewhere on the shore of the Gulf. These developments would enable a first-class Power to develop a formidable air threat to our essential sea route through the Gulf shortly after the outbreak of war. It will, therefore, be essential to be strong in the air in the Gulf immediately on the outbreak of war. Sloops will be powerless to protect our sea route against air attack, and it will be essential also to have adequate air forces there. If we are to have these necessary air forces available and trained, some at least must be provided there in peace, and if the cost of these is not to be superimposed upon that of the existing forces they must take over from the latter the routine duties in peace which they can equally well perform.Conclusion.; 20.   I therefore recommend (i) that the routine duties in the Persian Gulf shall be carried out by airforces, under R.A.F. control, (ii) that the sloops should be withdrawn without replacement,(iii) that the cruiser duties, however, should remain unchanged,(iv) that the portion of the grant-in-aid at present paid by the indian government, which is taken to cover the cost of the sloops maintained in the Gulf, should be transferred to Air Votes.ETavy Kntimfttefl, 1929, p. 10.
The present Garrison in the Sudan.4. The present garrison of the Sudan consists of 2 battalions of British infantry, 1 squadron Royal Air Force, and the Sudan Defence Force, a native force with British officers with a total strength of about 7,000 men.5. The role of the British infantry is to safeguard the centre of Govern-ment and the white population at Khartoum, to protect the railway lines of communication from Khartoum to Egypt and the sea, and to provide a stiffening and support to the native units of the Sudan Defence Force.6. The latter force is employed in support of the administration in maintaining the internal security of the country and to deal with raids from Abyssinia or the Western Deserts.The Decision on a Trial in the use of Air Power in the Sudan.7. The strength of the British garrison to be maintained in the Sudan and the potentialities of the Air Force in the control of that country have been the subject of considerable discussion in recent years.8.   In 1925 (when there was only one flight of 4 aircraft on detachment in the Sudan), the Governor-General asked for a full squadron to be permanently located at Khartoum, which would enable him to maintain the Sudan Defence Force at a lower figure than would otherwise be necessary.   As a result of considerable discussion old. Paper during the ensuing two years, it was finally decided, in 1927, to locate a squadron No. 751-B. there for one year in order to obtain a thorough trial of the efficacy of air forces in No^s-iT&quot; that country.9. In accordance with this decision, a full squadron was sent to Khartoum, and has now been in the country nearly two years. It has taken part in several minor operations in the Upper Nile Province, and, although not employed as the Air Staff would have advised, nevertheless carried out the function allotted to it with completeAir Control of the Sudan.&quot; The Defence Problem in the Sudan.1. The problem of safeguarding the Sudan is chiefly one of preventing a Mahdist outbreak, possibly combined with a simultaneous spread of disaffection in the Sudan Defence force. The headquarters of the Mahdist cult is on an island on the White Nile, about 150 miles south of Khartoum, but the really militant section of the cult, and the only source of any possible rising on a serious scale, is confined to the southerly portions of the Western Provinces of Darfur and Kordofan.2. It is considered by the local authorities that any concerted rising on a large scale is most unlikely at present; it is almost inconceivable that adequate warning of impending trouble would not be forthcoming, and even if the rising had initial success and the adherents of the Mahdi overran the Provinces of Darfur and Kordofan, the collection of a large army within striking distance of Khartoum must be a matter of months. An important consideration, moreover, is that the inhabitants of the area north of a line drawn east and west through Khartoum would show no signs of unrest until a revolt in the west had been completely and undoubtedly successful and even then the prospects of their becoming disaffected are by no means certain. This means that our communications from Khartoum with Egypt and the Red Sea would be tolerably secure.3. Apart from Mahdism, occasional sporadic outbreaks among the savages of the South have to be dealt with, particularly in the swamp areas between the Sobat River and the Bahr-el-Ghazal, where several minor operations have been carried out by Sudanese troops in recent years with the assistance of the Royal Air Force.
* It should be understood that the Air Staffs proposals were framed on the assumption of there being no Egyptian battalion in the Sudan.success. Moreover, the period of trial has confirmed the Air Staff in their conviction that the employment of air power in a primary role in the Sudan will meet with the same success as it has elsewhere in the Middle East, under conditions as trying as, and against enemies more formidable and better armed than, any likely to be met with in the Sudan.Outline of the Proposals Advocated.10. I do not think it necessary to recapitulate in detail the proposals put forward by the Air Staff on the subject of air control in the Sudan. The detailed application of their policy to the particular conditions prevailing in the Sudan has already been fully stated in the report of the Committee on Mahdism in the Sudan0.13. Paper   (C.I.D. Paper No. 751-B) and in the memorandum dated the 11th October, 1925,bto.76i-b.    which is attached as Appendix B to that report.*11. That proposal is, in brief, that the maintenance of internal security against Mahdist outbreaks and minor tribal disorders in the Sudan should eventually conform to the system which has already proved itself in other countries of the Middle East, where the Air Force is the primary arm. For this purpose no increase in strength above the squadron now located at Khartoum will be required, but it will be essential as in all schemes of air control that any operations undertaken should be under the direction of the Air Officer Commanding, who. should be in direct relation to the Political authority. This is an aspect of the scheme on which the Governor-General has as yet been unable to agree with the Air Staff, but the latter are convinced that the Sudan is peculiarly suitable for this form of control, and that no other can be either as effective or as economical. The foundations of such a system have, indeed, already been laid,.in that the network of landing grounds at all political and military centres on which the system depends is already nearing completion.12. The immediate measure recommended is the withdrawal of one of the two British battalions now maintained in the Sudan, which would represent a reversion to the normal British infantry garrison of the country prior to the outbreak of 1924.o.i.d. Paper   This step has already been urged by the Air Staff, and has received the approval ofMo.9u-B.    the Governor-General.13. The possibility of some reduction in the strength of the Sudan Defence Force and any reorganisation necessary to adapt it to the changed conditions should then be examined in the light of the immense accretion in striking power available for tribal operations afforded by the Squadron, At present, I would propose the o.i.d. Paper gradual reduction of the. Force to the figure (5,836 of all ranks) which was approved Wo.&apos;75i-B. by the sub-committee which considered the situation in 1926, in their report, C.I.D7 Paper No. 751-B, and which is more than 1,500 less than the present establishment. The detailed reductions to be effected would be a matter for con-sultation with the authorities on the spot, but the general policy should be the withdrawal of small isolated posts and the concentration of land garrisons at pivotal centres, where they will be available for the security of the air bases and to co-operate with the Air Forces as may be required.14. Finally, it is necessary to emphasise that the security of the Sudan should not be regarded as an isolated problem; a system of air control in that country would depend for its strength not only on the force normally located at Khartoum, but on the ability which we now possess to move other Air Forces from our Middle East Reserve into the Sudan whenever the situation demands.Costs.15. Not even an approximate indication can yet be framed of the economies to be expected when the full reductions rendered possible by their scheme have been put into effect. The withdrawal of one British battalion would involve an immediate capital saving of  40,000 and an annual saving of  42,100, the latter sum being the difference between the cost of maintenance of a battalion at Home and in the Sudan.
Air Control in British East Africa. -* General.I. The British East African dependencies consist of the four territories of Kenya Colony, the Uganda Protectorate, the Mandated territory of Tanganyika and the Nyasaland Protectorate. These territories are administered each under an Independent Colonial Government of its own, but the present tendency is towards some form of federation in certain directions, particularly that of defence.2. The armed forces at present maintained in the territories consist, firstly, of Regular Native Infantry, the King&apos;s African Rifles; secondly, of armed police, organised and trained on a semi-military basis; and finally, of European Volunteer Defence Forces in Kenya, Uganda and Nyasaland.3. A scheme has recently been approved for the reorganisation of the King&apos;s African Rifles, by which that Force will consist of a total of six battalions, maintained at a cost of about  280,000 a year, a saving of about  60,000 a year on present costs.I. I consider that, in these days, a better return could be obtained for expenditure on this scale, and even, possibly, still further economies effected, by substituting Air Power for at least a large proportion of the Native Infantry. There is no reason to suppose that the advantages of that form of control which have amply proved themselves elsewhere could not equally well be applied to East Africa, and, indeed, there are certain aspects of the Defence problem in that country, for the solution of which Air Power appears pre-eminently suitable.5. In considering this problem, it is first of all important to regard it not as an isolated one of the defence of any particular territory, nor even of East Africa as a whole, but as part of an extended system of mobile air defence in Northern and Central Africa; a single security organisation stretching from the Mediterranean coast of Egypt to the Zambesi, and connected by the air route which is already flown annually by a squadron from Egypt, and along which will shortly pass a regular commercial air line from Cairo to the Cape. Thus, not only would any air unit maintained in East Africa have behind it the full strength of our air resources in North Africa, but also would itself form a valuable addition to our Imperial Air Reserve, in the event of an emergency in which the security of East Africa was not threatened.The Defence Problem in East Africa.6. The defence problem of the East African Dependencies may be considered under three main headings : (i.) The Northern Frontier Defence, (ii.) Internal Security.(iii.) Defence of the Western and Southern Frontiers and Coast Defence.7. Of these, the first, the defence of the Northern border districts, is the most serious military problem, and at the same time the one most suitable for solution by air control.8. The frontier consists of some 800 miles of arid desert country. It presents a problem in many ways similar to that on the Southern Frontiers of Iraq; in each case the border lies in a desolate, inhospitable and inaccessible country, and in each case the enemy consists of well-armed, ruthless, mobile bands of fierce raiders. The problem of its defence, and the security of the tribes under British protection in the Northern districts of Kenya and Uganda, appears to correspond in almost every particular to the situations with which the Air Force has proved itself eminently fitted to cope elsewhere. The enormous extent of the area to be patrolled, the inaccessibility and general character of the country, and the nature of the enemy to be dealt with, all combine to bring about a situation in which only Air Power can ever be an adequate and reasonably economical form of defence.[20059] D
9. Apart from the Northern Frontier districts, the problem of internal security in East Africa is not a serious one; there has been little native trouble since the original pacification of the territories and the removal of the Arab slave traders. In Tanganyika and Nyasaland the Colonial Office have stated in their memorandum,o.i.d.Paper  attached as Appendix C to OLD. Paper No. 700-B, that &quot;There is no reason tok0.700-B. expect any internal trouble in these territories.&quot; Throughout Central Africa there is a semi-seditious, pseudo-religious undercurrent of pan-Ethiopian aspirations which requires watching, but any possibilities of trouble that do exist are of a type peculiarly susceptible to air action. &quot; The susceptibility of savages to moral influences is an important factor which must not be lost sight of; hesitation, delay or any retrograde movement will at once be interpreted as signs of weakness, and waverers who are always to be found among undisciplined natives will be tempted to throw in their lot with what appears to be the winning side.  Any signs of incipiento.D.0. Paper unrest should, therefore, be dealt with firmly and quickly.&quot;   (O.D.C. Paper No. 387No. 387.      Nyasaland Defence Scheme, 1929.)10. I consider this situation to be a particularly favourable one for a system of control by air; the great increase in speed and facility of communication thus made possible would enable the political authority to maintain closer touch with the tribes and with outlying police posts, while Air Power is pre-eminently suited to deal firmly and quickly with signs of incipient unrest.11. The third factor in the East African defence problem, that of external aggression from across the western or southern frontiers, or from the sea, is not very serious; cur neighbours on the west are the Belgians, and on the south the Portuguese, and it appears safe to assume that we are never likely to be called upon to defend ourselves from invasion on either of these frontiers. It should be sufficient to point out that, if such an improbable contingency were ever to arise, we should be in&apos;far better position to deal with it by means of Air Power, reinforced from the North and operating from an existing system of landing grounds and of seaplane stations on the lakes that form over 50 per cent, of the Frontiers, than by one or two native infantry battalions. While in the event of war with a maritime Power, the existence of the squadron in East Africa would provide a powerful defence and deterrent to seaborne attack on such important ports as Dar-es-Salaam, Kilindini and Tanga.Outline of the Scheme Proposed.12. My proposal would be that Air Power should constitute the principal striking force for the defence of British East Africa. If this principle be accepted, the organisation to give effect to it would be on the following lines : (i.) The basis of the scheme would be a composite squadron of general purpose and heavy transport aircraft, operating over a network of landingv grounds to be established along the Northern Frontier and throughout the territories at all - district headquarters and police posts, and of seaplane refuelling points on the lakes, on the same lines as that now being established in the Sudan.(ii.) The Squadron would probably be based on Kisumu, in Kenya Colony, which is an excellent aerodrome and seaplane base, the railhead of the line from Mombasa and the future headquarters of the East African section of the Cape-Cairo - air route. The squadron would consist of 2 Flights general purpose aircraft and 1 Flight heavy transport aircraft, the latter being available for use either as bombers, troop-carriers, or transport aircraft for the squadron, as may be required. Normally, two Flights only would be at Kisumu, and they would find a patrol on the Northern Frontier, and another patrol when necessary, with Float under-carriages, on the shores of Lake Victoria and the northern portion of the chain of lakes that form the western Frontier.The third Flight would be detached in the South, probably at Fort Johnstone in Nyasaland. and would also be equipped with alternative under-carriages.This Flight would be relieved at intervals so that the whole squadron would gain experience of working in any part of the territories.
(iii.) Wireless stations should be provided at ail District headquarters for communication with the Squadron, in the northern area especially, an intelligence system on the lines maintained in Iraq must be organised and the various intelligence centres connected by wireless to the squadron. Three or four of such posts must be established along the Frontier; they should coincide, where possible, with existing police or K.A.R. posts, and should include a landing-ground, fuel dump and bomb store, with the necessary guards. This intelligence system is of especial importance, since tne squadron cannot find continuous patrols along the whole Frontier, and will have to rely largely on early intelligence as they do now in Iraq; to give them warning of raids.(iv.) The duty of the squadron, in addition to dealing1 with raids across the northern Frontier, would be to maintain an intimate association with the civil administration of the territories by keeping in constant touch with out-lying police posts, transporting civil officials on tours of inspection throughout their provinces, and by means of demonstrations, or where necessary the instant application of force, to maintain internal order among the tribes.(v.) The King&apos;s African Rifles should either be reduced to the strength necessary to find the requisite guards for air stations and escorts for political officers, or, alternatively and I am inclined to this course as being the most effective and economical they should be disbanded altogether and the police increased to meet the same purpose. Whichever course is adopted, it is probable that the strength of the force required will be about two battalions, the annual cost of which should not exceed  80,000. Any disbandment may for political reasons have to be gradual, but I feel convinced that in the end these proposals would provide a more effective form of defence at less cost.Affiliation of an Auxiliary Air Unit.13. European Volunteer Defence Forces already exist in Kenya, Uganda and Nyasaland, and in this direction again additional security could be provided by the organisation of existing civil air resources as Auxiliary Air Forces. There already exists at Nairobi a Civil Flying Club, and the number of private owners in East Africa at present small is bound to increase. The club already includes a number of members with air qualifications, both as pilots and ground personnel. and a proposal has already been considered, that they should be organised for defence purposes. Under the conditions at present existing, this proposal was not practic-able, but with the presence of a regular R.A.F. unit in Kenya it appears probable that an auxiliary air unit might be raised, affiliated for training and operations to the Regular squadron, which would have very real value for internal security and to assist the R.A!F. by taking over some of their functions in time of emergency.Projected Air Unit in Southern Rhodesia.14. An interesting suggestion has also recently been received from Southern Rhodesia; it has been tentatively proposed that that Colony should raise a small air unit for internal security purposes, the unit to be trained by and normally accommodated with the Air Force of South Africa. There is insufficient informa-tion available for any concrete proposal in this direction, but the suggestion is one which should be considered in connection with the scheme outlined above, and the organisation and functions of any Air Forces raised in Rhodesia should be co-ordinated with the general scheme of air control in East and Central Africa generally.Costs of Present Proposals.15. The foregoing paragraphs necessarily contain only a broad outline of the scheme. In particular, it is impossible at this stage to give any detailed estimate as to the cost of the scheme, or the saving which it would afford on the present system of defence. The initial capital outlay on accommodation, preparation of landing grounds, provision of wireless communications, &amp;c, and including the full initial cost of the squadron, would probably be about  400,000, and the annual[20059] D 2
recurrent cost of the squadron would be about  140,000. It should, however, be remembered that the territories concerned are even now in process of being opened up to civil air communication, and that the necessary development of air routes and landing grounds would have a direct value for civil purposes. Moreover, the disbandment of native infantry would make available a considerable amount of accommodation of some commercial value, which would to some degree counter-balance the initial expenditure involved. Once a squadron is established in East Africa and the reductions in military forces effected, I am confident that the result would be to show a substantial annual saving on defence expenditure, and a more effective and up-to-date method of defence, both in East Africa itself and in relation to the general requirements of Imperial Security.
Substitution in the West African Colonies.Forces at present maintained in West Africa.1. I consider that a strong case exists for investigation of the possibilities of partial substitution of Air Forces for native infantry in the British West African Colonies and Protectorates of Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and the Gambia.2.

In addition, Armed Police Forces of a total strength of nearly 7,000 of all ranks are maintained in the territories.The Defence Problem.4.   The problem of defence in West Africa is one of  (a.) Internal security.(b.) Defence in the improbable contingency of war with France.5. In Nigeria, internal trouble is mainly confined to spasmodic tribal disturbances, and a widespread rising is&apos;considered most unlikely; if such a rising were to occur, the most probable source of its inception would be in the Mohammedan areas of the North. In the Gold Coast, Sierra^ Leone and&apos; the Gambia there is ho reason to anticipate internal trouble on a, serious scale.6. The question of security against attack by France, unlikely though that may be, presents more serious difficulties.  The problem is two-fold (i.) The defence of Freetown in Sierra Leone against attack by land, sea or air.(ii.) The defence of all four colonies against invasion by land or raids by air.
Defence of Freetown.7. From the purely Imperial point of view the security of Freetown is the consideration of greatest strategical importance. In a war with France, Freetown would be a fuelling port, a naval anchorage and a convoy assembly port, and one of the Imperial wireless stations may be built there. With the French in possession of Freetown, sea communication with the greater part of the Empire would under certain circumstances be seriously interfered with. At present the fixed defences at Freetown are on a care and maintenance basis, and considerable expenditure would be required to modernise them and render them fit for Avar (vide Section VI of this paper).General Defence of the Four Colonies.8. From the point of view of the other Colonies, the problem is mainly one of defence against land invasion in greatly superior Force by columns of native infantry from the French Colonial possessions which surround them. On this side of.the question the most important aspect is the security of the Mohammedan districts of Northern Nigeria, which are the best recruiting areas in West Africa and the loss of which would be a serious blow to British prestige in the Mohammedan world.The French maintain in West Africa a squadron of general purpose aircraft, and air attacks, particularly on Freetown and certain objectives in Northern Nigeria, might have serious results.The Defence Situation as it is at present.9. There are strong grounds for thinking that the existing resources are in no way suitable to the requirements of defence in West Africa. For defence against organised invasion&apos; by land they are totally inadequate ;* for defence against seaborne attack they are of negligible value without incurring considerable expendi-ture, which is unlikely to be practicable in the near future; and for defence against&apos; air attack they are non-existent. Moreover, any forces maintained in the colonies on the present lines are of no value to the general defence of the Empire as a whole in a war in which the security of the West African Colonies is not threatened. This situation represents a very poor return for an annual expenditure of more than half a million sterling.Outline of an Air Scheme of Defence.10. In their report on the defence of the West African Colonies the Oversea Defence Committee make the following recommendation : &quot; The Committee consider, therefore, that, although the present state of our relations with France renders a war with that country unlikely for many years to come, it is desirable that plans should be made to provide from local resources, if and when the necessity arises, both for the preservation of the territorial integrity of these Colonies and for the protection of the port of Freetown, the defence of which would be of great importance in the general scheme of Imperial Defence.&quot;11. The external defence situation in the West African Colonies differs from that of most other British possessions in that the principal contingency to be provided against is a war with France. In that event except possibly for Freetown no reinforcements by land could be provided from Imperial sources; Nigeria and the Gold Coast would certainly have to depend entirely for their protection upon the forces maintained in peace, wdth the addition of any additional units which they could raise internally in war. Any scheme of defence must be framed on that basis, and, therefore, though air forces may constitute theOEJO Farar * A recent survey by r.he Oversea Defence Committee of the general aspect of the defence of tin- \\ estBe.*685-M.

principal striking force in internal disturbances and in the initial stages of a war, the scheme must include arrangements for the provision and expansion of adequate local land forces at the earliest possible date after mobilisation, to co-operate with the Air units in defence against organised invasion.12. No exact estimate is possible at this stage of the strength of the Air Forces required, but I have in mind a composite force of some 4 Flights of general purpose aircraft and 1 Flight heavy transport aircraft, of which a part would be detached in the Gold Coast^nd the remainder would be in Nigeria. The general purpose units would be equipped with a type of aircraft suitable for employment in ordinary tribal operations, in coast defence against naval attack on the scale to which Freetown is liable, and in low flying action against organised land forces in the defence of the land frontiers of the Colonies; while the heavy transport aircraft would be of a type suitable for use either as transports, heavy bombers or troop carriers.13. I am confident that the problem of defence of the land frontiers is one particularly suited to air action; the country generally is suitable for air operations, while the enemy columns, composed of native units, whose organisation will render them vulnerable, whose discipline and morale are such that they are unlikely to stand heavy punishment from the air, and whose anti-aircraft weapon training is not likely to be of a sufficiently high standard to be very formidable, will present a particularly favourable objective to air attack. Moreover, the maintenance in peace of a nucleus of air power, as proposed in paragraph 12, would make it more feasible to provide air reinforcements.14. The defence of Freetown and Sierra Leone generally would be provided for by the despatch of a Flight from Nigeria in the precautionary stage or on the outbreak of war; a landing-ground, fuel and- bomb store would be required at Freetown, and the Flight would be required to carry out annual training in coast defence duties at Freetown in peace.. The distance from the Gold Coast to Sierra Leone is more than the present range of general purpose aircraft, but the Air Ministry are already developing arrangements whereby such aircraft can be fitted with emergency tankage for 1,000 miles; the personnel and working stores of the Flight will be conveyed to Freetown in the heavy transport aircraft.15.   A proposal has recently been submitted by the Governor of the Gambia for goD-^0Pa*,er the disbandment of the Gambia Company R.W.A.F.F. and the substitution of   e&apos; aircraft for them in the defence of that Colony.   The views expressed by the Governor coincide with those I hold myself, and although it would not be possible to maintain a detachment permanently in the Gambia if only for reasons of expense the provision of an air base with fuel and ammunition stores in the neighbourhood of Bathurst would make it possible to divert a Flight at a few days&apos; notice from elsewhere in West Africa in the event of internal trouble in the Gambia on a scale too serious for the police to handle.  The training of the Air units in West Africa would include periodical visits to the Gambia, and the possibility of immediate air reinforcement in an emergency would probably justify a smaller increase in the strength of the Gambia police than that outlined by the Governor in. his memorandum.16. Finally, these Air Forces would provide the most valuable form of defence against air attacks from the French African Colonies, against which our possessions in West Africa are at present completely defenceless.17.   The existence of an Air Force in West Africa, providing as it would a weapon of great offensive value for tribal operations and for resisting invasion in the initial stages, would enable the Colonies, although reducing the peace strength of their land Forces, to reorganise them far more effectively for expansion in war at no greater total of defence expenditure than is incurred annually at present, and possibly even to effect economies.  Without going into detail, the general principle of the scheme would be the reorganisation of the R. W.A.F.F. on a training cadre basis, which would include the reduction of the proportion of colour service to reserve service in the Regular Forces, and the extension of the territorial system as xemplified in the Gold Coast Territorial Force.   It is probable also that further economies could be effected in the  direction of increasing the mobility of the &quot;an-power available by a certain extent of mechanisation as is now proposed in -^ast Africa-and of an increase in the proportion of automatic weapons to riflemen.
18. I feel convinced from close personal knowledge of West Africa that a system on these lines, while providing the necessary strength in land Forces for internal security and for the assistance of the civil power in the event of disturbances in towns and centres of population for which the use of air power is not suited, would also constitute, in co-operation with the air units, a Force considerably better adapted to the defence requirements of West Africa, and at less cost, than those at present existing.Costs.19. No detailed estimate of the cost involved could be framed without a careful examination of the circumstances on the spot. The provision of the Air Forces required would involve a capital outlay of about  500,000, and their annual recurrent cost should not exceed  240,000. With regard to the cost of the reorganised R.W.A.F.F., it may be pointed out that the proposals now under consideration for East Africa involve the provision of six battalions partially mechanised at an annual cost of  280,000. Even if the economies to be obtained are slight, the Forces available as a result would be in every way more suited than at present to the purpose for which they are required.
[20059]EAir Forces in Coast Defence.Coast Defence Policy: General.1.   In January 1924-the Committee of Imperial Defence adopted the following basic principle for trie determination of our Coast Defence policy : &quot; (i.) That in view of the importance of concentrating our available No. 214-0, resources for defence as far as possible on mobile forces, whether by sea, land or imh0XJ)-air, Coast Defences should as a matter of principle be maintained at a minimum, compatible with security.&quot;2. Since that date, detailed investigations have been carried out by various Sub-Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence in connection with the defences of home ports and many of the ports overseas. Recommendations have been made for the reorganisation of the fixed defences at those ports. A memorandum on ci.d.m*xbo. general principles of coast defence was produced in November 1927, in which the No-308&quot;0-&quot;ideal&quot; scale of defence against various forms of attack was described, and in which it was recognised that &quot; a variety of considerations, among which finance will undoubtedly figure prominently, will in many cases make it impossible to provide defences on the &apos; ideal&apos; scale, and will, as in the past, necessitate compromise.&quot; The Air Staff, during the course of these investigations, have only been able to agree with the other services on the measures recommended for the defence of ports, on the assumption that existing methods, i.e., fixed armaments, remain the primary instrument in coast defence. That they are very far from accepting that assumption as sound will be seen from the records of the controversy on the subject of the defence of Singapore, which has been in progress intermittently throughout the last five years. Singapore, indeed, has been taken in a sense as a test case on which to argue the relative merits of the methods recommended, on the one hand by the Air Staff, and on the other by the General and Naval Staffs. The latter favour the modernization and perfection of existing methods of fixed coast defences, supple-mented by the co-operation of aircraft for spotting and for anti-aircraft defence; while the former have claimed that, in these days, a great, advance, both in efficiency and in economy, is to be gained by the partial substitution of a mobik system of air defence for a static system which has altered only in the detail of its application since the Napoleonic wars.3. No survey of the problem of the substitution of air for other arms would therefore be complete without the mention of its possibilities in respect of coast defence. I am convinced that a fuller utilisation of air power for that purpose could achieve both economy and increased security. This view rests in part on the realisation that the expenditure necessary to modernize the existing defences is very heavy, while their utility is confined to the contingency of a major war against a naval Power, so that a system of defence by air, while being the only one which  as far as can be foreseen- contains any hope of practical accomplishment, represents in its most effective form that compromise on the necessity for which we are all agreed.The Present Position of our Coast Defences.4.   The total length of coastline for the defence of which Great Britain is responsible including India and excluding the Dominions amounts to approxi- -mately 25,000 miles; it contains no less than forty ports and naval bases, at which fixed defences of varying strengths and efficiency have to be maintained in peace. The investigations of the various committees referred to above showed that these o.o.s. defences are completely out of date, both in armament and ammunition.   Apart No-146-from Singapore, which is the only port where any work is now being done, it became obvious that the expenditure of a very large sum; of money, amounting to several millions^ would be necessary if the armament of the other defended ports were to be modernized and equipped for war, while additional great expense would be involved, by the replacement of the existing stocks of war reserve ammunition, all of which is now obsolete.
5. Moreover, from more recent examination of the subject, it has lately become clear that it is not merely the existing armament and ammunition which requires renewal, but that the whole system requires comprehensive reorganization and the provision of additional equipment if fixed defences are to be of anything but negligible value; the number of guns must be increased to allow of grouping in adequate numbers for salvo fire; up-to-date fire control equipment must be provided; for those ports where guns of a.calibre greater than 6-inch are installed, spotter aircraft must be provided and, in certain localities, fighter aircraft also, to enable the spotters to work in the face of opposition by enemy seaborne aircraft.6. It will thus be obvious, and indeed it is admitted, that the many fixed defences now maintained at considerable annual cost are, in fact, useless under modern conditions; and that, if they are to be made effective, we must spend vast sums of money to bring them up to date. Even if they were to be modernised, though it may be argued that tfiey might possibly then be as effective as aircraft for the close defence of ports an argument which I am not prepared to accept they are, at any rate, no more so. Furthermore, it must be remembered that aircraft have to be provided, in either case, if not in substitution for the guns, then as an auxiliary to them.7. Such is the existing situation in what is wrongly described as our coast defence system. The name is, in fact, misleading, since ail that is claimed for the fixed gun is that it ensures some measure of security for, and acts as a deterrent to attack upon, certain defended ports. To get a clear idea of the commitment involved by coast defence under the existing system, it is necessary to remember the serious diversion from the decisive front represented by the very large numbers of mobile troops which were retained in England in the last war to guard against a possible invasion, when they were urgently needed overseas.8. Whatever may be said for the efficacy of fixed defences at the defended ports, it is obvious that they can have no effect on the security of our coasts as a whole, including the many important mercantile ports which it may be in the interests of an enemy to attack, and for which no fixed defences can be provided. The German bombardments on Scarborough and Penang, the landings on Gallipoli, the capture of Tsingtau and the land investment of Port Arthur are examples of operations against coasts outside the rayon of the fixed defences, all of which operations would at least have been very hazardous in the face of modern air opposition.The Air Proposals in OtUline.9. It is therefore clear that the whole of our system of coast defence requires re-examination in the light of modern conditions; and in my view no tenable reasons exist for withholding from air forces an extensive share in the responsibility for defence against seaborne attack. The system of fixed defences is now an obsolete form of insurance upon which a high premium has to be paid for ineffective cover. I would urge the substitution for it of a system which would afford a more satisfactory cover in war and from which, in addition, a useful return can be obtained in normal times for the expenditure involved.10. The essence of my proposals is that security against seaborne attack in certain areas should be provided by aircraft, which in war should be the primary arm instead of merely an additional auxiliary, and which could be usefully and actively employed on other duties in connection with Empire defence in peace. The aircralt, whose primary role in war with a maritime Power would be coast defence, would be employed in peace, in addition to their coast defence training, upon the duties for which aircraft have already proved themselves to be so well suited, such as the control of undeveloped territories in the Sudan, in Aden, in the Middle East and on the North-West frontier of India. They would be available as part of our air-striking forces in the event of a war in which&apos; the security of our coasts is not threatened. They would be equipped for the dual role of operations over land and coast defence, and their regular annual training would include all forms of action against ships and rapid concentration over great distances by means of our strategic air routes, the geographical distribution of the Empire (other than the British Isles) and ot territories under British control is pre-eminently suited to the use of air power, and the air routes are now being developed largely for commercial purposes and at civil expense-by which it will soon be possible to concentrate a powerful striking air force within a few days within range of any threatened point from Capetown to Singapore.
11. This policy has in the past been strongly advocated in connection with the defence of Singapore, and has been as hotly contested. It has been argued that aircraft can provide no adequate defence or deterrent against surface ships; yet torpedo attack from the air is now recognised by the Admiralty as one of the most serious menaces to which warships are exposed,&apos; and the figures of effective hits in peace exercises during the last four years has averaged nearly 50 per cent, of the torpedoes fired, a far better result than that shown by any other form of torpedo carrier; while bombing, though still almost in its infancy, has already attained a percentage of hits against a moving ship greatly in excess of that attained under similar conditions by coast defence guns. It has been argued that bad weather or darkness may make it impossible for the aircraft to operate. The fact, on the contrary, is that bad weather unless it is so bad that no effective attack from the sea could be carried out and no shore gun could see to fire is a positive advantage to the defending aircraft, since it enables them to achieve surprise and evade counter-action. It is claimed that air attacks will be defeated and prohibitive casualties imposed by anti-aircraft fire; but the outstanding characteristic of air attacks on ships is their suddenness and their short duration, and I am convinced that no volume of fire which any Fleet afloat could bring to bear will prevent the majority of pilots getting home their attack. Finally, the chances of wind and weather are quoted as likely to make it impossible to rely on aircraft being able to concentrate at any given point and time. It appears hardly likely that this argument will be much longer sustained. At the present stage of development fog is the worst enemy of aircraft; fog apart, even to-day the cross-Channel air services are able to operate in weather which keeps the Channel boats in port, and the various mechanical aids to air navigation which are now being developed will soon make long-distance flying under almost any conditions of weather a matter of certainty.12. In fact, the efficacy of air action against surface ships, though largely a post-war development, can no longer be questioned. We have in the aeroplane a weapon with the accuracy and hitting power of the big gun, with five times the speed of a destroyer, and with a range at present of 200 miles which is likely to be greatly increased in the future, enabling it to strike at attacking vessels hours before and after they are within range of their objective; a weapon which alone can provide an effective defence against sea-borne air attack; which could be concentrated at short notice whenever and wherever danger may present itself, and which, when the threat to that particular point has passed and the sphere of operations has shifted elsewhere, is not obliged to .remain behind, embedded in concrete emplace-ments; and, finally, a weapon which can be provided at far less cost than the old-fashioned fixed defences, with their attendant auxiliary aircraft.13. It would be premature at this stage to attempt to formulate any scheme in detail; generally speaking, the policy which I advocate would substitute (according to the particular circumstances in each area) a force of aircraft in defence of a given stretch of coastline for all guns of a calibre greater than 6-inch, now locked up at the various points along it. Landing grounds would be established in the neighbourhood of all important vulnerable points, though aircraft would not necessarily be permanently stationed in normal times at the point to be defended in war; their primary duty in a war with a maritime Power would be coast defence, and they would be trained for that duty, but they would be normally stationed in peace at those localities most convenient for the execution of their duties in peace, and would be enabled by the provision of air routes and landing grounds to be concentrated rapidly where required in war.14. An example will be found in Sections IV and V of this paper, where&apos;it will be seen that if proposals for air substitution are accepted, part of the air forces to be allotted to the defence of our East and West African Colonies will be available in war for the protection of such important ports as Freetown and Kilindini, for which at present there appears no prospect of the provision of adequate defences.Costs.15. The capital expenditure entailed by modernizing all existing coast defences and providing for our new commitments, such as Singapore, would probably exceed  8 million, of which about half is represented by the cost of the projected defences at Singapore.  For obvious reasons, no close estimate can at this[20059] E 2
stage be given of the number of extra air units necessary to meet the coast defence commitment, but the number required, over and above existing strengths, for the replacement of ail guns of more than 6-inch calibre at Imperial and Indian defended Ports would be from 8 to 10 squadrons, representing a capital outlay of not more than  3 million.16. The difference between this sum and the figure of 8 millions quoted above cannot be taken as clear net saving, since some expenditure will be involved in modernizing the 6-inch armament which must remain under the Air scheme. To give a conservative estimate, however, the total capital saving to be effected by the adoption of the Air Staff proposals throughout our coast defences would certainly not be less than  3 million. Moreover, it must be remembered that, until the fixed defences, existing and projected, have been comprehensively modernized, they are of little practical defence value.17. The economies on recurrent costs are even more difficult to estimate; the difference in annual cost of the extra squadrons and the existing 9-2-inch batteries is unlikely to be considerable, but if fixed defences are to remain, spotter units will have also to be provided, the number and cost of which would probably not be less than that of the torpedo-bomber units proposed under the Air Scheme. So that actually the saving to be gained represents the greater part of the annual maintenance costs of all the 9-2-inch batteries and any heavier armament which it might be decided to instal.Dominion Coast Defences.18. This survey would be incomplete without mention of the Dominions, who are ultimately concerned in the subject. The investigations of the sub-committees on the Defence of Ports were extended at the request of the Dominion Governments  to cover the fixed defences at Dominion Ports; and they resulted in recommendations for their reorganisation and modernisation on the same lines as those for the defended ports at which the Imperial and Indian Governments are responsible, in the Dominions, however, the possible share that Air Forces may come to take in coast defence has already been the subject of consideration, and the present position is that the Governments of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, while recognising that their present coast defences are out of date, are taking no action until agreement has been reached on the air question between the three Fighting Servibes at Home, and a definite policy for coast defence can be adopted by the Imperial Government. It will then be possible for the Committee of Imperial Defence to advise the Dominion Governments on the basis of an agreed policy. A decision to allot a share in Dominion coast defence to Air Forces would, indeed, be a matter of more than merely domestic concern to the Dominions themselves, since the Air Forces raised for that purpose would be available, in the event of a war in which the security of their coasts were not threatened, to form part of any Dominion contribution to Imperial Defence as a whole.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.19. (i.) Our whole system of coast defence requires re-examination in the light of modern conditions : recent investigations into the existing fixed defences have shown them to be entirely out of date and to require comprehensive modernization at very heavy cost. In effect, the present situation is that the fixed defences which we maintain at great expense at the large number of defended ports along our 25,000 miles of seaboard, not only are admittedly powerless to avert attacks upon our undefended ports and open coast lines, but are also of little practical value even for the purpose for which they are designed.(ii.) A share in the responsibility for coast defence should be allotted to Air Forces in substitution for guns of calibre greater than 6-inch. Security against attack in a given stretch of coastline would be provided by air units which may in normal times be located elsewhere, subject to coast defence training requirements, and usefully employed on other duties in connection with Empire Defence, but wb,ich will be enabled by the establishment of a system of air routes and landing grounds at all important vulnerable points, to be concentrated rapidly where they are required in war.
(iii.) A mobile system of defence on these lines not only is in these days a more effective and up-to-date means of defence than fixed guns of comparatively short range, but also represents, in its most effective form, the compromise which is recognised to be rendered essential by the limitations of finance; and it is a particular advantage that the expenditure involved is not merely as in the case of fixed defences a costly unproductive and ineffective form of insurance against very improbable contingencies, but that the air units provided for the purpose will be of direct value in&quot; other ways both in peace and war, though they may never be required to operate actually in defence against sea-borne attack.(iv.) The Dominions are awaiting a lead from the Imperial Government in this matter and are especially interested in the possibilities or air power in coast defence; and any units which may be provided in the Dominions for this duty will also be available in the event of war with a non-maritime Power to form part of any Dominion contribution to an Imperial striking Force.
The Naval Forces for Routine Duties in the Red Sea.3: There are two sloops for duty in the Red. Sea which is part of the ambit of the Mediterranean Station. The sloops have to proceed through the Suez Canal to Malta for refitting every half year. This entails prolonged absence from the patrol area at the southern end of the Red Sea; in addition to which absence is entailed for refuelling and for occasional defects.Duties to be carried out.4.   In the main the routine duties of the sloops consist of :  (i.) Showing the flag.(ii.) Anti-slavery and arms traffic patrols.5. The former of these has been dealt with in Section II, paragraph 14, of this paper, in connection with the Persian Gulf, and the considerations there set forth apply writh equal force to the conditions obtaining in the Red Sea.6. As regards the latter, anti-slavery and arms patrols, the considerations set out in Section II of this Memorandum in regard to the slave traffic in the Persian Gulf, apply in general to the Red Sea also, though naturally the local conditions are different. The traffic undoubtedly exists, but in small dimensions, slaves being smuggled across in two&apos;s and three&apos;s and in many instances undoubtedly completing their journey over-land.7. The interception of a slaver by a warship is particularly difficult in the Red Sea, since the sea crossing is short and slavers can cross in a strong breeze in the hours of darkness. The waters along the coast are shoal waters, and it is difficult for a warship to pursue close in. The horizon of a sloop is limited, her speed is low, and her movements are well known to the slaver organisations and can be forecasted.8. The two sloops available in the Red Sea together total not more than about 1,500 cruising miles a month in the slave patrol area.9. Flying-boats, armed with a light gun and machine guns and a small search-light, and operating in pairs, would have no difficulty in dealing with a dhow, particularly if either or both of the flying-boats were of the troop-carrier design, to which the flying-boat class of aircraft lends itself especially well. Their horizon is very wide, and their high speed would enable them to reconnoitre the whole area effectively and to cover a considerable mileage.The Substitution of Air Forces for Naval Forces for Routine Duties inthe Red Sea.Introduction.1. I have not considered the possibilities of substitution of air power for routine duties in the Red Sea sufficiently to put forward even an outline of a scheme for giving effect to it. But there is good ground for believing that.it would apply to the Red Sea as to the Persian Gulf (see Section II above).2. At present, experience is, being gained of the climatic and operational conditions in the Persian Gulf as&apos; affecting flying boats; while float-planes from Aden are obtaining, as their other duties permit, similar experience at the southern end of the Red Sea.
Additional Advantages deriving from Substitution of Air Forces.10. Besides the above duties which flying-boats can undertake, other advantages deriving from my proposals would be (i.) Protection of Sea Communications in War.Aden is one of those defended ports at which it will be necessary to have flying-boats &quot;&quot;at the outbreak of a major war in the East, for anti-submarine, anti-commerce-raider and anti-minelayer patrols, to safeguard the passage of the fleet to the Far East, and for the protection of our seaborne trade route. To possess these requirements at the outbreak of war they must be provided in peace. To provide them in peace in addition to the sloops, whose duties they can undertake both in peace and in war, would be to superimpose their cost most uneconomically upon our defence expenditure. .(ii.) Development of Maritime Air Route.Flying-boats located in the Red Sea would be able to open and maintain the maritime air route to India, which would be required for flying-boats in a major war in the East.   There is no other way of developing this route.(iii.) Assistance in Emergency in Defence in Arabia and Africa.When the necessary air route facilities have been developed, the presence of flying-boats in the Red Sea would be a valuable steadying factor along the eastern coast of the Red Sea. They would, in an emergency, be able to assist the air and other forces normally located in the Suez Canal zone in the Sudan, Aden, Somaliland and British East Africa, and also to show the flag along the inhospitable south-east coast of Arabia, where, from time to time, the crews of stranded ships are at the mercy of the very wild inhabitants. There has recently been an example on this coast of the value of aircraft for such a purpose.Air Ministry, November 1929.
APPENDICES.I. Air Control in Iraq, 1922-29.II. Extracts from Parliamentary Debates on Air Estimates; 1929APPENDIX I.Air Control in Iraq, 1922-29.I. The Method of Employment of Aircraft.(i.) THE primary and most frequent use of service aircraft in Iraq is for patrol and for intelligence purposes. The air arm serves as a constant reminder over wide areas of the ubiquity of the resources of the government of the country (cf. Report on Iraq Administration (Colonial No. 4)) : &quot; . . . . The effectiveness of air control would be only partially considered if mention was omitted of its value as a threat, and as a means to close co-ordination and co-operation of administrative effort over an immense area ill-provided with other means of communication. An aeroplane or formation of aeroplanes, either employed for the purpose or on some administrative duty, can be seen in the air by a widely spread population, and provides an effective reminder to many of the existence and power of Government.Without air transport, the niceties of administration and military touch are impossible with other existing means of travel in Iraq.....By its means it has been possible to achieve a highly centralised yet widely understanding intelligence, which is the essence of wise and economical control.&quot;(ii.) Where unrest is suspected the despatch of a few machines to the area of disturbance usually suffices to re-establish public order without any necessity for offensive air action, though the efficacy of warning patrols obviously rests upon the realisation by recalcitrant tribesmen of the fact that stronger sanctions are in reserve. In this connection, the following extract from the Report on the Administration of Iraq (Colonial No. 13) for 1923-24 is significant:  &quot; During the whole period under review, a main factor in the pacification of the country has been the Royal Air Force. By prompt demonstrations on the first sign of trouble carried out over any area affected, however distant, tribal insubordination has been calmed before it could grow dangerous, and there has been an immense saving of blood and treasure to the British and Iraq Govern-ments. In earlier times punitive columns would have had to struggle towards their objectives across deserts or through difficult defiles, compelled by the necessities of their preparations and marches to give time for their opponents to gain strength. But now, almost before the would-be rebel has formulated his plans, the droning of the aeroplane is heard overhead, and in the majority of cases their mere appearance is enough.&quot;(iii.) Actual bombing has seldom been resorted to, and only (1) for defence against external aggression, e.g., Wahabi raids; (2) more rarely in answer to open and armed defiance by Iraq tribes persisted in after warning had been given of the consequences of defiance.(iv.) Casualties inflicted or sustained have been on a small scale, and indubitably far fewer than would have been sustained if the work carried out by the air arm had had to be performed by detachments of ground forces.

APPENDIX II.Extracts from Parliamentary Debates House of Commons. Vol. 226,   No. 66.   Thursday, March 7.Air Estimates.Sir S. Hoare.The Air Force has been on active service during the last twelve months in the Middle East, in the Sudan, in the Aden Protectorate and in the North-West Frontier of India.In the case of the military operations in Iraq it was the encroachment of certain tribes many miles over the Iraq frontier, and the butchery of large numbers of men, women and children, that brought the Air Force into operation. In Aden it was the kidnapping of two sheikhs friendly to Great Britain. In the Sudan is was the murder of a British Commissioner, a Greek trader and several natives that compelled the Air Force to take action. On the North-West Frontier it was the kidnapping of several peaceful Indian subjects. On all these occasions the Air Force went into action, and the operations were carried out successfully, with scarcely any casualties amongst either the Air Force or the native population. In the case of the Air Force there was only one death in action during all the operations. As for the native population, they were saved long-drawn-out military operations with all the casualties that these inevitably entail.Where few realised the value of air power in the Empire, the achievements in Iraq, Aden and India have now convinced public opinion of its inestimable importance.Lieutenant-Colonel Moore-Brabazon..... I do say that the Commons of England have a right to talk about defence in its entirety. That is the whole problem to be solved. Who among the Members here can tell us how much we could take off the expenditure on the other two services if we spent  10 million more on the Air Service ? Does anybody know that ? Do the Government know that ?   Can they tell us anything about it ?In 1921 my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with great imagination, gave the Air Force charge of Iraq and Transjordania. I wonder how many millions we saved in that way ? It was a wonderful thing to advocate at the time; it was a leap in the dark, but it was a great success, and we have saved millions. In 1928 the Air Force took over Aden. I want to know : &quot; What about the Sudan, what about Somaliland, what about the Indian Frontier, and what about coastal defence ? &apos;&apos; Along al] those lines, surely, there is a possibility of economy in the national expenditure on armaments, if the Air Service will only pull its weight.Does my right hon. Friend the Air Minister not realise that from his point of view the two great vested interests are the War Office and the Admiralty? What has he done to hack his way through them? If he had hacked his way through, we should have had a general lessening of the expenditure on armaments to-day, even though the expenditure on the Air Service might have been higher. After all, peace in our time does not necessarily mean somnolence on the Treasury Bench.Captain Guest.An attempt has been made in this Debate to try and force from somebody a statement as to whether the Air Force is to be a type of national defence and what is the relationship of the three great fighting forces. From the point of view of the Air Ministry, I submit that in view of the additional duties they have taken on their shoulders, these Estimates are an absolute model of economy. The Air Ministry have in recent years undertaken greater responsibilities, and they have had to provide additional barracks and other impedimenta from the very start, and I think I can rightly claim for the Minister that considering these vital factors the Estimates are very moderate indeed.
I will now deal with, the question of substitution. In 1922 a gamble was under-taken by the Air Ministry in Iraq and Transjordania. The question has been asked, what has been the economy to the taxpayer of that decision since that time? The experiment has been completely successful and no less than  40,000,000 has been saved to the taxpayer since 1922. That is a very considerable sum. The next day-to-day policy of substitution occurred a few months ago in the form of two additional flights being sent to Aden to replace two battalions there. What will be the economy to the taxpayer of that decision? I asked a question on this point and I was told that the saving by this replacement would be between  200,000 and  300,000 a year. The Sudan offers an excellent opportunity for further national economy and substitution and a squadron has been sent there. I am satisfied that this policy of substitution will be successful. I think someone should examine this great problem more closely and the House should be told what is the long-distance policy by which the defence of this country will be safeguarded. These substitutions are nearly always Army replacements. Why should we not have some substitution for the Navy. The taxpayer can be saved untold millions by the Air Force taking over Malta. That is perfectly possible and worthy of serious consideration. On one occasion I remember suggesting to the Imperial Committee of Defence that Singapore should be handed over to the Air Force, and I was nearly blown out of the room by the big guns of the Admiralty for making that suggestion. So much for the policy of substitution.Captain Cunningham Reid.By spending more on matters appertaining to air, and considerably less on those of the Army and Navy, not only would the national Exchequer greatly benefit, but so also would national security. I am convinced that such a policy would appeal, not only to the purse, but also to the common sense of the majority of English men and women, as would also the political party that had the courage to carry it out.Rear-Admiral Sueter.For the third year in succession, the Air Minister had taken a seventh of the amount allowed for the Fighting Services.   That is not enough.I would like to ask-the Minister whether he is contemplating taking over any other places besides Aden, because I agree with the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Bristol, North, that we might extend and take over more places. I should like to congratulate the Air Minister on the wonderful performance of the handful of machines in evacuating the whole of the British and foreign nationals from Kabul. I was talking with some military people the other day, and they said that a whole Brigade was massacred on the Afghan frontier in 1842 and that it would have taken the whole of the Indian Army, reinforced by units from the British Army at home, to carry out a mission like that to a successful conclusion.Lieutenant-Commander Kenworthy.I suggest to the Secretary of State for Air that one of the duties that might well be taken on by the Air Force is the duty now performed by the Navy with great difficulty, and that is the suppression of the slave trade in the Red Sea. The use of seaplanes, I think, would be quite practicable there. Another duty is the suppression of piracy in Chinese waters. If we can send shallow-draft gunboats up the Chinese rivers, we can easily send aeroplanes. I want to strengthen the Ministers hands in obtaining supplies from a close-fisted Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to protect him from the overwhelming bullying of the Admirals and Generals.
