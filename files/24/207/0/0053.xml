ao.;AO V wjET.ies(29)- popy No. 3^1AJ.,.L1.IJ -E^QRT..CREDITS .ANC RUSSIA. MEMORANgJM-BY THE PRESIDENT.. of the. BOARD.. OF TRADE.1. In common with some of my colleagues, I have boenapproached recently on many oocasions by Members of parliament and others on the subject of the grant of credit facilitiesfor Russian business, and I am anxious to obtain guidance fromthe Cabinet as to the course we shall take in this matter.s   The,,ExportirCredits, Guarantee Scheme .    The Aots governingthis Scheme lay down that the powers of the Board of Trade maybe exercised &quot;with the consent of the Treasury and after oon-sultation with an Advisory Committee set up for the purpose&quot;and that the total amount of the guarantee shall not exceed 26,000,000.    They also provide that no guarantee shall begiven for credits of longer than five years.    In addition,certain administrative restrictions have been&apos; imposed on theworking of the Scheme, of which the most important for thesopurposes is a restriction by the Treasury that long termcredits shall not be granted for an amount of more than 2,000,000 in all without further reference to the Treasury.3. E*rC.,0. ..Soheme. a-Qd...BUSs la.. OP- the. 1st August, theAdvisory Committee were empowered by the present Governmentfor the first time to consider business with Russia-    It took a few weeks for traders to appreciate the position, and serious business has now been running for about 3 months.4. The Committee at once made wide use of their powers, andin the past three months have offered to guarantee more than 1,100,000 of exports to Russia.    Whether this businessmaterialises or not depends upon negotiations between theindividual exporters and the Russian buying organisations, withwhich the Department has no concern, but out of this  1,120,000-1-
approved, the Department has already entered or Is about to enter into firm contracts to oover  370,000.    No doubt an appreciable part of the balance must be considered as having lapsed -5.  I would point out that the Department&apos;s commitments of  370,000 now running on Russia are larger than the Department&apos;s commitments running on any other individual country in the world, and business continues to come in.    Further evidence that the Department&apos;s terms and conditions are satisfactory is shown by the fact that firms who have taken advantage of them are returning for further contracts.    I may add that the premium charged is about the same as that charged for Greece, Poland, Roumania and other countries whose credit is not free from doubt, and less than that charged for Latvia, Lithuania, etc.; it is about one-third of the rate which has been charged up till recently for Russian business by private insurance institutions in the City arid at which,  I am told, appreciable business was effected.I may add that the standard basis for the premium calculations for Russian business is a rate of 3 per cent, per annum,  but a number of technical considerations, such as the percentage of each bill which the Department guarantees and the length of the actual credit in any particular case,  operate to reduce the charge.      The standard basis for Russian business is about the same as that for Greece, Poland, Roumania and other countries whose credit is not free from doubt,  and is less than the standard basis for Latvia, Lithuania, etc., where it varies from 9 to 10 per cent, per annum.6.  I think I have shown that wo have a sufficient answer to critics who allege that our efforts to stimulate trade with Russia have been futile .    The question which has now to be faced is whether guarantees should he given in respect of Russian business for which long credits are requested.
9   9tJ CJ&apos; i-J7. Hitherto the Department on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee- has confined its approval to applications for guarantees for credits of not rnoro than twelve months. In doing so they have followed the practically universal business distinction for this purpose between consumablo commodities, for which short credits,  say, six months, are customary and capital goods,  especially machinery of all kinds, for which long credits,  say, two years and upwards, are often requested.    The bulk of the Russian exports now guaranteed by the Department relate to:consumable commodities.8. As regards long credits generally, tho grant of such facilities in the nature of the case presents greater difficulties than short credits^ the risks run for a longer time and the individual amounts involved tend to be more substantial.    The Department during the last throe years has given long credits to the amount of  800,000 out of a total business of over  10,000,000.9. A certain amount of long oredit is already given to Russia by a few firms in this country,  o.g. Babcock and Wilcox, Vickers and certain textile machinery manufacturers. Some firms obtain special arrangements or special high prices which compensate thorn for the risks involved, but it would appear that most of these firms do not feel justified in taking further risks and that some are anxious to pass on to the Department part of their present risks.10. A similar view of the Russian position is held abroad. The British Embassy in Berlin stated recently that &quot;the feoling of uneasiness here regarding the situation in Russia is very acute and all serious and well-informed observers, both official and unofficial, furnish increasingly gloomy, reports&quot;.    In Czechoslovakia,  the Commercial Secretary roports:    &quot;It seems abundantly clear that,  speaking financially, the brakes have
O (J (been very consistently applied to Russian business during the past twelve or eighteen months&quot;.11. The views of foreign Governments do not differ from^those of foreign financial and manufacturing interests. The German Government Scheme for credits to Russia has expired and will not be renewed.    With some small exceptions the Gorman Government is not now giving, and is not prepared to give, any spocial assistance to German trado with Russia, except for short credits. The German Government Scheme for export credits to Russia, which was very similar to the British export credit scheme, it said, according to the Commercial Counsellor in Berlin, &quot;to have failed in its main purpose, which was to produce additional business and was merely seized upon by the Gorman exporter as a favourable opportunity to reduce the risk of business which he would have done anyhow&quot;.12. There is also an Austrian scheme, under which goods to tho value of about  1,000,000 were exported to Russia in 1928.    Tho Commercial Secretary in Vienna reports that this scheme has not caused any increase in Austrian exports to Russi and indeed has not prevented them from declining.    Norway is reported to have an official scheme but credits are not granted for more than twelve months.13. Here the Export Credits Advisory Committee have oon-sidered very fully the question of long credits for Russia, and have made a definite recommendation against the grant of such facilities.    The Committee contains representatives of manufac-turing as well as financial interests, and it may be assumed that they reflect the genoral opinion of represontative manufacturers and the City cn this question.    I understand that some members of the Committee feel that the Department has gone too far already in extending the credit terms to twelve months.
9 9 Atj ts14. It is not the Committoe&apos;s practice to givo reasons for their recommendations but it may probably be assumed that they are not satisfied with the credit of the Russian Government, especially in the absence of any settlement in regard to debts and properties,  or with the prospects of repayment some years hence of credits granted to-day,  in view of the information they receive about the Russian economic position.    Another difficulty is the absence of any tangible security for these long credits.    In all other long credit business it Is the general,   rule of tho Committee, as of the business world generally to require some dofinito socurity, such as a mortgage on tho machinery that is exported.    Even if a mortgage on goods sent to Russia could be obtained,  it could presumably not be enforced in Russia against the Soviet Government.15. I understand th&quot;.t the Committee&apos;s view in regard to all countries is that, generally speaking,  a country that cannot float a loan on the market is not suitable for the grant of long credits.IS.  In view of the foregoing considerations it is, I think,  clear that the Department at this moment could only grant long credits to Russia if it were prepared to act in the teeth of a definite recommendation of the Advisory Committee and of City opinion.    I need not point out that it would at all times be inconvenient to act in this way even though we might feel that employment considerations were decisive    I suggest, however, that we could not choose a more unpropitious moment for extending the activities of the Department to a new sphere of transactions than on the ove of the Russian negotiations,  as wo should be depriving ourselves of bargaining power in our attempt to obtain an adequate measure of compensation for British claimants in respect of Russian debts, etc.
9^r;a t) cJCredits Guarantee Department be instructed at tho presenttime to grant long crodits to Russia.    Our future policy must, I suggest, depend largely on the course of thenegotiations.    If Russia will recognise the claims ofBritish creditors which she has hitherto refused to do andshows herself ready to give adequate compensation,  obviouslya different situation would arise.    The credit of the SovietGovernment in this country would certainly improve and as apart or consequence of the settlement we may be able withgeneral approval to stimulate employment by facilitating thegrant of credit for longer terms than at present granted.I have consulted the chancellor of tho Exchequer,  theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,  and the Lord privy seal, who agreo with this memorandum.    The Lord Privy Sealdesires me to add the following noto of his viewsr-&quot;I am in substantial agreement with the views setforth in the above memorandum.    From the point of viewof employment (and leaving on    one side the question whetherit is expedient to make or announce any change in advanceof the forthcoming negotiations),  it would be desirable todo more extensive business with Russia, provided thoRussians really intend to do the business and not merely tomake use for their own ends of an offer by the BritishGovernment to facilitate the business,  and provided alsothat the business is one on business terms.    Neither of theseconditions is fulfilled by the requests and suggestions oftho various persons who are at present interesting themselvesin securing longer credits for Russia from the BritishGovernment, and until they are fulfilled the views expressedin the above memorandum have my full    support.&quot;W.G.ard of Trade. 13th December,  1929.
