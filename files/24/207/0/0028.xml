Printed for. the: Cabinet,   November 1929.Copy No.      3 cabinet.BRITISH MILITARY FORCES IN CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum setting out the Foreign Office view of the considerations which induced me to resist the suggestion of the War&apos; Office to reduce the existing garrison in China by one battalion.I cannot emphasise too strongly to my colleagues the importance of our being guided bv His Majesty&apos;s Minister on the spot.A. II.November 26, 1929.IT seems desirable to supplement the Foreign Office letter to War Office, df the 19th November on the above subject, which has already been circulated to the Cabinet, by a brief memorandum explaining the reasons which have led the Foreign Office to withhold concurrence in the recommendations put forward by the Army Council to the effect that the total strength of the British military garrisons in China should be reduced by one British infantry battalion.The interest of the Foreign Office in the strength of the military garrison in Hong Kong arises out of the special function discharged by the latter in forming a local reserve whence military detachments can be sent at short notice in the case of a grave emergency arising constituting a menace to British life and property in one or more of the various centres in China where British communities are established -with particular reference, of course, to Shanghai. It seems unnecessary to labour this point, since the Army Council seem fully to share this view of the special function of the Hong Kong garrison as a local reserve.This factor being then constant, it would appear that the strength of the garrison should not be decreased unless the likelihood of any grave emergency arising in the immediate future is held, by those most competent to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government, to have diminished at the time when a decision on the strength of the garrison is being formulated. That likelihood varies with the fluctuating political conditions in China, and is especially affected by two major considerations : (i.) The existence, or the possible existence in the early future, of a state of civil war on a large enough scale to bring about widespread turmoil and insecurity of life and property in China, (ii.) The recrudescence, or the possible recrudescence in the early future, of anti-British or anti-foreign agitation in China.It is submitted that only in the absence of both of these factors can a reduction of the total garrison in China be effected without dangerous risk.The Foreign Office, in order to satisfy themselves whether these factors are present or not when the question of the strength of the garrison is reviewed, must rely very considerably on the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking, who, in turn, must be guided by the views of the Naval Commander-in-chief in China, since the naval forces under the latter&apos;s command must, in the event of any reduction in 5126   [20203]SECRET.CP. 337 (29).
the military forces immediately available to deal with any emergency, be faced with increased responsibilities.The Foreign Office, therefore, felt bound to ascertain the views of His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking before concurring in the recommendations of the Army Council now under review. Sir M. Lampson felt equally bound to consult the Naval Commander-in-chief, and received from him a reply to the effect that Admiral Waistell considered it definitely dangerous to reduce further any of the garrison in China at the present time.  Sir M. Lampson concurred in this view.Moreover, it is clear from the replies of His Majesty&apos;s Minister and the Commander-in-chief that the two factors which justify, if they do not necessitate, the maintenance of the British garrisons in China at their existing strength actual or imminent civil war on a large scale, and a possibly imminent recrudescence of anti-Brifish or anti-foreign agitation are both present; and it may be added that the political situation in China in these respects has definitely deteriorated since the question was last considered by the late Cabinet on the 20th February, 1929, when it was decided not to reduce further the garrison at Hong Kong.There are two questions of first-class importance, negotiations on which are to be opened with the Chinese Government at an early date. I refer to the extra-territorial system and the so-called Provisional Court at Shanghai. The Chinese Government are expected to denounce unilaterally, by the 1st January, the treaties granting extra-territorial rights to certain foreign Powers, ourselves in the front rank. It is not possible to say whether they wall make a really serious attack on those rights, or whether the denunciation will be more or less of a nominal character. If they contemplate a serious attack they will mobilise public opinion, and the position of British subjects in China may be made very unpleasant, and even actually dangerous. The Chinese Government will have the same weapon at their disposal at any time during the negotiations, should their course not suit Chinese desires. Similar considerations apply to the question of the Provisional Court, though in this case denunciation of the existing arrangement at an early date is a possibility only, and is not known to be a probability.In view of these facts and of the very clear and decided views of His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking and the Naval Commander-in-chief in China as to the definite danger of any reduction of the total British garrison in China, the Foreign Office must conclude that the time has not yet come when the reduction proposed by the Army Council can be effected without dangerous risks.
