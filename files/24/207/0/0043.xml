Maintenance Allowances. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.1.      I have discussed the question of the amount and conditions of the proposed maintenance allowances in their application to Scotland with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Education at which meeting we agreed to give, further consideration to the chief points under discussion,-     I have done so and I submit hereunder the oon-clusions at Which I have arrived and the recommendations which I would&apos; make on. this highly important problem.whether the payment of the allowances should be com-pulsory on the Education Authorities. 2.      I have given careful consideration to the representa-tions made by the President on this aspect of the question but I, nevertheless,  remain of the opinion that the giving or not giving of the allowances should not be left to the discretion of the Education Authorities.      I recognise that a substantial Exchequer grant would be an inducement to some Authorities to make the allowances, but even at the highest rate of grant which, has. been suggested,  viz.,  75 per cent.,  I think considerable difficulty would have to be faced in obtaining the voluntary co-operation of the Authorities throughout Scotland.     A burden on the rates of even only 25 per cent, of the total expenditure would be sufficient,  in my opinion, to deter some Authorities from taking voluntary action.      I would propose,  therefore, that the giving of the allowances (subject to whatever scale of means is prescribed)  should be an obligation on all Education Authorities
It is important to remember that in Scotland we are changing over to the Town and County Councils in May, 1930,, the existing ad hoc Education Authorities &quot;being then abolished.     The new Authorities will have had no such experience of the value of, and need for, maintenance allowances as the old Authorities have had under Section 4 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918.     The new Authorities may not, therefore, at first at any rate, be inclined to administer the proposed system of maintenance allowances sympathetic-thetically under a voluntary system.     And a bad start-off would be very undesirable politically. These considerations reinforce my view that the matter should not be left to the discretion of the local authorities.As the Authorities which will have to administer the maintenance allowances in 1931 have not yet come into existence, it has not been possible to consult with them in the manner&apos; which has been possible in England and it will not be possible to consult with them until early next year.Should the allowances be a permanent, or a temporary arrangement. 3.     In this matter I should wish to see the giving of these allowances a permanent feature of our educational system;    but I recognise, nevertheless, the weight of the argument for a temporary period put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the financial difficulties which he may have to meet.     At the same time, I think that any temporary period should be for a least  five years.     Ho shorter time would be sufficient to make clear the economic, industrial and educational/
educational repercussions which will arise and I regard the results of at least a five years1 experience as of the greatest value in determining the principles of future act loftyThe rate of allowances 4.      I do not think that a rat6 of&apos;5 is sufficient having regard to the Wages which hoys between 14 and 15 can earn and whiah they will lose under compulsion.      In the mining industry;,  for example,  12o. to 15s. a week is a common wage for such a boy.      I recognise that the allowance will not be subject to the risks of ill health and unem-ployment as a wage is;    but,  at the same time,  I feel that 6s.  is the least that should be given when we consider the economic position of the large pro-portion of the parents concerned.The scale of means. 5.      I am strongly of opinion that this should be uniform for the whole country.      The costs of the necessities of life - food,  clothes, rent, etc, -have been very much evened out in Scotland in recent years and there does not,  in my opinion, remain any sufficient difference between the various parts of--Scotland to justify the difficulties involved in administering a series of different scales. .    Ho such differences are considered in the Health, Unemployment and Pensions Insurance schemes.      If tliey are embodied in the maintenance allowancesscheme/
0 *y o* c 0scheme, I am aure they will give rise to much criticism.As to the scale to he adopted I feel that what is wanted is some easily applied general measure of income and that its application should not involve any vexatious scrutiny into the means and obligations of individuals-      I suggest that an income limit with adjustment for dependants be taken as the test,.     If the father&apos;s income falls below the resultant figure., he should be entitled to the maintenance allowance in respect of any child between 14 and 15 attending school.The Chancellor of the Exchequer favoured the idea of applying the London scale of  130 plus an allowanoe for one child., but as I have already said we agreed that each of us would consider the matter further.      I have considered the matter further in the light of information which I have received, as to the conditions under which maintenance allowances are at the present moment granted to children voluntarily attending school beyond the present compulsory age in one of the most important Education Authority areas in Scotland where allowances are made to children of parents whose income is as high as  300 a year;   with the result that I have come to the conclusion that the least I am prepared to recommend is  180 if the parents have one child and  2 30 if they have two or more children to support.      These would be the figures below which in each case I think the maintenance allowance should be payable.in/
In urging a more generous scale I am impressed &quot;by the fact that it is the children in m small families who in general now attend voluntarilybeyond fourteen,,      But under compulsion the parents with large families who have the heaviest burden to bear will be brought in.The rate of Government grant0 6.      I think that this rate should be fixed at 75 per cent, of the total expenditure^      The new compulsion proceeds from a decision of the Government, not from the exercise of a discretionary power by the Education Authorities and,  therefore,  the Government should,  in my view,  contribute very substantially to the local expenditure to be incurred under that decision.      If we give a grant at the rate of 75 per cent, we shall overcome a very large part,  if not all,  of any local hostility to the measure which may emerge.     We must remember the heavy burdens which the educational rates are carrying,  especially in the industrially depressed areas of Scotland. If we only give 60 per cent.  I fear that the introduction and operation of the new principle in our educational system may be considerably impeded not only by those who are prejudiced against the raising of the school age, but also by those who, though possibly sympathetic, may be alarmed by the heavy new charge on the local funds.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer was willing that the st at e/
State should pay 60 per cent, of the cost of thefxallowances;    hut I would, nevertheless, ask that the higher rate should he carefully considered in view of what I have said above.Estimates of numbers and costs. 7.      I give in the Tables below estimates of numbers and costs in Scotland on various stated assumptions.      I should mention that I have gone on the basis that the allowances will be payable in respect of all children (subject to the scale of means) affected by the new educational compulsion. That is to say, I have included the children in secondary schools and special schools as well as in the primary schools and advanced divisions, and this principle has been adopted both to calculate the total cost of the maintenance allowances and the cost to the Exchequer.      I feel very strongly that no distinction can be made between primary and secondary pupils in this matter.      Ill Scotland the same-school often houses pupils of both types, both kinds of school are managed by the same Authoritjr and the grants are paid as one lump sum in respect of the whole local service.     Even from a purely educational point of view, any such distinction in Exchequer aid would be very undesirable as it would bring financial considerations into what should be an educational choice of a suitable course for a given child.

The total number oi pupils between 14 and 15 years of age estimated to be in the schools in 1932 is taken at 60,000.      It is very difficult,  if not impossible,  to say what proportion of this number would be eligible for maintenance allowances under the scale of means proposed.     Accordingly, figures axe given for four hypotheses, viz., 50 per cent.,  60 per cent., 70 per cent,  and 80 per cent.      I do not think that in Scotland the propor-tioii would be as low as 50 per cent.,  the figure on which the Presidents estimates are based.Table I shows the figures for a maintenance allowance of 5s. a week.
