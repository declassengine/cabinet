....................................document Is the Property of compulsory Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)SECRET.CP. 318 (29)CABINET.Copy No.   S 3Soviet. Government&apos;s request for the agrement of M.Kameneff as Soviet Ambassador.I circulate to my colleagues a copy of a telegram received from the Norwegian Minister in Moscow, in which the Soviet Government basic for the agrement of His Majesty1s Government to the appointment of Monsieur Kameneff as Soviet Ambassador in London.The proposal raises a question of some difficulty in that Monsieur Kameneff &quot;became involved when he was in England in 1920, in a controversy with the then Prime Minister.   He was accused by Mr. Lloyd George of:(1)   Participation in the realisation of Russian^ jewels in this country;(2)   Subsidising the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;;(3)   Having relations with the Council of Action;(4)   Incorrect transmission of the Russian condi- &apos;. tions for the armistice with Poland. The attached statements published by Monsieur Kameneff and by Mr. Lloyd George at the time set out the points in dispute.I must now ask my colleagues for a decision as to whether it is desirable to recommend His Majesty to give his agrement to this appointment.   Of course, if the agrement for Monsieur Kameneff is refused, it will boopen.......
*pen to the Soviet to refuse their agreYnent to Sir Esmond Ovey&apos;s appointment to Moscow.In the meantime I think it right to draw the attention of my colleagues to the statement which has appeared in the&quot;lzvestiya&quot; on the subject of the attitude of the Soviet towards the Third Internationa The actual report forms annex 4 to this paper.A.H.November 12th,1929.

In connexion with Monsieur Kameneff&apos;s appointment Monsieur Litvinov stated be could not speak English but French and added that there were not many candidates at the disposal of Soviet Government who were sufficiently acquainted wlth the Engli sh language.Monsieur Litvinov also asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government should defer rVLlng any public announcement regarding Monsieur Kameneff&apos;s appointment until it had been published in Moscow.Te;:t by post today;.
THE DAILY NEWS, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14th, 1920.M. KAMENEPF AND THE PREMIER. Strongly worded reply to Charges. Letter to M.P.&apos;s.M, Karneneff has made public his reply to the charges which, as announced in yesterday&apos;s &quot;DailJ News,&quot; were formulated against him &quot;by the Prime Minister at last Friday&apos;s Downing-street interview.Before leaving London he addressed the following letter to certain members of Parliament:128, New Bond-street, W.I. 11th September, 1920.Dear Sir,During my stay in England I have been able to convince myself of your sincere desire to restore peaceful relations with the Russian people and its Government.I therefore feel it my duty to protest through you before British public opinion against the circumstances attending my departure from England.The substance of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s statement on the eve of my leaving amounts to this:   that the British Government considers it unnecessary to continue political negotiations with the Soviet Government for peace. &quot;Cloud of Accusations&quot;.Before making this announcement Mr. LloydGeorge
George, for the whole month that I have been in England., has used every means to delay any approach to real peace negotiations, and has only now decided to hide the breach of the peace negotiation under a cloud of accusations&apos; against myself as the representative of the Soviet Government0Mr. Lloyd George has put forward four counts against me:1,   Participation in the realisation of Russian jewels in this country.2.    Subsidising the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.3.   Having relations with the Council of Action.4.   Incorrect transmission of the Russian conditions for the armistice with Poland.Therefore, in order to prevent British public opinion from being deceived on this matter, I wish to make to you the following declaration:1.   That I hod nothing to do with any realisation of jewels.2.   That neither in my capacity as President of the Russian Delegation nor as a private individual have I ever given or offered any subsidy either to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; or to any newspaper whatsoever, nor to any director or proprietor of any newspaper. The Council of Action.3.   That when the members of the Council of Action paid me the honour of a visit they asked for no advice, and I made not the least attempt to influence them.   I confined myself to statements of
of positive information, and all the time made it clear that the obligations under which I lay to the British Government debarred me from any other action than the communication of bare facts.4.   The question relating to the terms of the Polish armistice was settled by the Soviet Government&apos;s giving up the point about the workers&apos; militia in Poland,, and this concession was the result of a series of representations made by me to Moscow.The introduction of this point is the more hypocritical in that the Prime Minister might have made use of it at least three weeks back had he considered it in the slightest degree as an obstacle to the further conduct of peace negotiations with myself as intermediary. Open Policy Demanded.I came to England for the purpose of concluding a peace with the British Government in the name of the interests of the workers of all countries. I leave England confident that this idea will triumph.   But my bitterest regret is that the British Government has not had the courage to declare openly its change of policy, but covers its actual breaking off of political negotiations by paltry and unproved accusations supplied by subordinate secret police agents;.I imagine that you will admit the right of the Russian people to demand from.the BritishG overnment
j. Government at least an open and consistent policy.I remainYours sincerelyL. Kameneff. Sir William Sutherland, M.P. seen hy a press representative last night said:&quot;The statements made by M. Kameneff are entirely untrue.   Most of them bear their own contradiction, and if necessary a great deal more-can be said by the British Government&quot;.
Extra*t from &quot;The Times&quot; September 16th, 1920.KAMENEPF AND THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; .Prime Minister^ reply. Russian Delegate&apos;s &quot;deceit&quot;,The following statement was issued from No.10 Downing Street last night:-In the communication which Mr. Kameneff had thought fit to address to certain Members of Parliament for the purpose of publication, certain statements are made oaten-sibly &quot;in order to prevent British public opinion from being deceived&quot;, but in fact&apos;expressly devised to deceive it.(1)    Mr. Kameneff, after stating that Mr. Lloyd George had accused him of participating in the realisa-tion of Russian jewels in this country, observes &quot;I had nothing to do with any realisation of jewels.&quot;     The Government have evidence that.Mr. Kameneff was cognisant of the sale of jewels in this country; that he informed his Government that  40,000 worth of stones had, in fact, been sold and that the proceeds had been paid over to the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;, and, further, that he was taking steps to procure a further sum of about  80,000, partly out of the sale of jewels, of which an additional  10, 30 was to be paid to the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;.     So far from Mr, Kameneff having had nothing to do with any realisation of
of jewels he was actively concerned with the transaction and took pains to report it to Ms government.(2)    Mr. Kameneff observed &quot;neither in my capacity as President of the Russian Delegation, nor as a private individual, have I ever given or offered any subsidy either to the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; or other newspaper what so-ever, or to any editor or proprietor of any newspaper0&quot; Similarly on August 20th the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;, after the wireless telegrams had been published showing its rela-tions with the Soviet government, declared that it had received &quot;not a bond, not a franc, not a rouble.&quot;The government had evidence which tlatly contradic both these statements;   before that date diamonds which were brought over by the Russian Delegation were sold in London for between- 40,000 and  50,000, great care being taken that the transaction should not pass through any bank account, but that bank notes should be received in payment,THE RUSSIAN JEWELS. On September 10th the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; astonished its readers by suddenly asking the question: &quot;Shall we take  75,000, of Russian money?&quot;   And summed up in the affirmative.     &quot;To accept it,&quot; observes this.organ, &quot;will be to complete a notable episode in international socialism&quot;.    The episode will indeed be notable.     It is stated in the article that not gold, but an offer of gold, had been received by Mr..Francis Meynell, a director
tj itDirector of the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;, who was stated to have acted absolutely on his own initiative in the matter. The jGovernrnent have evidence that these statements are incorrect, that Mr. Edgar Lansbury, the son of Mr. George Lansbury, the editor of the paper, had in fact received half of the notes given for the jewels.The &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; proceeds to imply that, the money which had thus been offered was slowly collected in Russia;   that it v/as to be held in trust for &quot;The Third International&quot;, and to be offered to the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;, if the need arose, and it pretends that before receiving any of the money the editor wished to take the opinions of his leaders.    The Government have complete evidence that, so far from this sum having been slowly collected in Russia, the greater part of it was realised very promptly by the sale of the precious stones in London.Some of the innocent readers of the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; had written to it in answer to its question, &quot;Shall we take  75,000, of Russian money?&quot; expressing surprise that the question was asked.     There is no mystery here. It is easy to explain why the question is asked and why it was asked on September 10th.     The enquiry in the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; was published on September 10th because Mr. Edgar Lansbury had been interviewed by the police just before and asked to explain wiry he had had possession of some of the notes which formed part of the price realis-ed by the sale of the Russian jewels.     The Government permit themselves to doubt whether the &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;would
01 Owould have taken the public into its confidence with respecrto the Russian money but for the fact that it had been apprised that the secret could no longer be kept.AN ALTERED DESPATCH. (3)     Mr. Kameneff truthfully observes that the Prime Minister charged him with having- incorrectly transmitted the Russian conditions for the Armistice with Poland.     Mr. Kameneff does not attempt to deny that he did in effect deliberately alter the terms of the despatch which he had received from his government containing the fundamental conditions of the armistice to be proposed to Polandc     The Russian Soviet govern-ment had made it plain to Mr. Kameneff that they would insist &quot;on the arming of the Polish workers under the control of representatives of the Trade Unions of Russia, Poland, and Norway&quot;.     Mr. Kameneff., who realised that such a condition would be unacceptable in this country as out of harmony with the principles of British Trade Unionists and destructive of the independence of the Poles, concealed the intentions of his government under the apparently harmless phrase of a &quot;civic militia&quot;.(4)     The Government greatly regret that it has been found necessary to bring these facts to the public not ice, but the evidence that Mr. Kameneff has violated the pledge which he gave to His Majestyfs Governmentto abstain
to abstain from active propaganda, direct or indirect, in tills country, is so overwhelming and the apology which he has issued to the press is so misleading&apos;, that they are left with no alternative.
SOVIET AND RED PLOTS.&quot;CANNOT CURB ACTIVITIES&quot;.MOSCOW, Sunday.&quot;The Soviet did not and cannot promise to euro &quot;the activities of the Communist International, which &quot;is an independent organisation outside Soviet control;1 says -&quot;IZVESTYA&quot;., the Soviet Government organ, comment-ing on the statement made in the House of Commons by Mr.. ..Arthur Henderson, the Foreign Secretary.It would-be quite as reasonable, adds &quot;IZVESTYA&quot;, to ask Mr,. Ramsay MacDonald to control anti-Soviet propaganda by the Second International, with which the British Labour Party is connected, and the news-paper issues a warning that Mr. Henderson&apos;s hints that the Soviet&apos;s obligations regarding propaganda include; controlling the Communist International, are a mistake..-      British United Press.
