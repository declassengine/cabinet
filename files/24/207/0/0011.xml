Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.      34CP. 321 (29).CABINET,SUSPENSION BY THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT OF THE ASSISTED PASSAGE AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.A TELEGRAM from Mr. Scullin on this subject, and also a telegram from the British Government Representative in Australia, have already been circulated to the Cabinet. For convenience of reference, I append copies of these telegrams, and also of an interim telegraphic acknowledgment which I have sent to Mr. Scullin, and of two further telegrams now received from Mr. Crutchley (Appendix I).It will be seen that the new Commonwealth Government has decided to suspend altogether (with one insignificant exception) the grant of assisted passages for migrants from this country to Australia, and that, at the same time, while they recognise that this decision entitles the British Government to regard the Common-wealth Loan and Migration Agreement (commonly known as the  34,000,000 Agreement) as being abrogated, they express the hope that we shall nevertheless continue to co-operate with them under that Agreement.The  34,000,000 Agreement was negotiated by the previous Labour Government in this country with the Commonwealth Government, but was actually signed by the Conservative Government in April 1925. Its object was to promote the further development and settlement of Australia by means of contributions by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards the interest on loans raised by the Commonwealth Government for expenditure by the various State Governments on development and settlement during the period of ten years from 1925 to 1935.The quid -pro quo for the contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom was the obligation on the State Government concerned to provide for the satisfactory settlement of one assisted migrant for every  75 of loan money issued to that State, or, in the case of schemes for land settlement, of one family for every  1,000 (subsequently raised to  1,500) so issued.The maximum amount of loan money to be issued to the States under the Agree-ment within the period of 10 years is  34,000,000, and the approximate maximum contribution payable by the British Government, should the whole of that amount be issued, is  7,000,000. The approximate number of assisted migrants whom the States would be required to settle, in the event of the whole sum of  34,000,000 being issued, is 450,000. Both the amount of the British contribution and the number of assisted migrants to be settled are liable to a not very appreciable variation according to the proportion of land settlement schemes to development schemes undertaken under the Agreement.The total amount of loan money issued up to date under the Agreement is  6,280,829, in respect of which our contributions have amounted to  1,118,466. In addition, there are contingent liabilities in respect of schemes begun but not yet completed, which would increase the total British contributions by an additional amount of  682,857.The total number of assisted migrants whom the various States are required under the Agreement to absorb before April 1935, in respect of the amounts of loan money already issued to them, is 58,445.   In fact, most of the States have already&quot; [20145] b
largely exceeded, their obligations, the total number of assisted migrants actually absorbed to date in the whole of Australia since the signing of the Agreement being 101,100. Only two States have not yet reached their total obligation Western Australia, to the extent of 2,521, on a total absorption responsibility of 37,608; and South Australia, to the extent of 2,329, on a total absorption responsibility of 9,424. It will be realised, however, that these States have still five years in which to make up their present deficiency.On these figures it seems clear to me that we are not in a position to claim that Australia has obtained up to elate the advantages of the Agreement and is now seeking to evade her obligations under it. In fact, taking Australia as a whole, she has more than fulfilled her obligations pari passu with the advantages which she has gained.For this reason, if for no other (and there are others), it seems to me that we are bound to accept the decision of the Commonwealth Government without criticism or complaint.It remains to be considered whether, as Mr. Scullin somewhat tentatively suggests, we are to continue to contribute under the Agreement to the carrying out of development schemes in Australia, notwithstanding the total suspension (with an insignificant exception) of the grant of assisted passages.It must be realised that the suspension of assisted passages to Australia means in effect the suspension of migration to Australia. Owing to the fact that it is not possible to ascertain how many persons who were originally assisted migrants are included in the statistics relating,to persons returning from Australia to the United Kingdom, it is not possible to state with precision the proportion borne by assisted migration to total migration, but it may be safely assumed that this proportion is certainly not less, and probably a good deal more, than 80 per cent. Furthermore, it is probable that, in any case, owing to the present economic situation in Australia, the number of unassisted migrants during the next two or three years would not have been large. We may take it, therefore, that, whereas during the last five years the total net migration from this country to Australia has varied from 37,000 to 20,500, with an average of 29,500, the number who will migrate during the period of suspension is likely to be quite insignificant.It will be seen from Mr. Crutchley&apos;s telegram that Mr. Gepp, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Development and Migration Commission, claimed that those States who have exceeded their obligation to absorb migrants under the Agreement are entitled to additional loan money, irrespective of any further absorption. This, however, is not a view which we could, I think, in any circumstances accept; and it will also be seen that Mr. Scullin, so far from supporting Mr. Gepp&apos;s contention, practically admits that, in view of the decision to suspend the grant of assisted passages, we should be entitled to decline to continue to make further contributions under the Agreement towards the development of Australia.My own view and it is one that I hold strongly is that it would be both short-sighted and in other respects impolitic to inform Mr. Scullin that, in view of his decision to suspend the Assisted Passage Agreement, we are unable to continue our contributions under the  34,000,000 Agreement. It is to be borne in mind that the present economic situation in Australia is, to say the least, unsatisfactory, and that if the cost of living and of production in that country should continue (as it seems likely for the present to continue) to rise, and/or the price of wheat and wool to fall, we should, even if the Assisted Passage Agreement were to remain in force, almost certainly be faced with a further sharp decline in the figures of migration. The truth of the matter, in my opinion, is that for the moment most States of Australia haye very nearly, if not quite, reached the present limit of their capacity to absorb additional population, with the possible exception of women and boys. If that is the case, however, any action on our part which would tend to hamper any increase in Australia^ absorptive capacity would surely be ill-advised; on the contrary, we should, subject, of course, to a balance of financial considerations, do all that we can to assist such an increase. There is the further consideration, not without importance, that it is desirable that our response to the first request made to us by the new Labour Government in the Commonwealth should be such as to show that we are ready and anxious to help them in every possible way in the extremely difficult task which confronts them.What, after all, was the real object underlying the  34,000,000 Agreement? It certainly was not, as I understand it, simply to procure the absorption of one migrant for every  75, or of one family for every  1,500, of loan money issued;
if that were to be the sole result of, our expenditure under the Agreement, the Agreement would, in my opinion, have been hardly worth making, The real object of the Agreement was so to increase the economic attraction of Australia that she would be pushed over the dead end (that is to say, the point prior to which the flow of migrants to a new country is a. mere trickle, requiring stimulus by artificial means), and would attain the position, reached by the United States in the middle of the last century, where the flow of self-supporting migration automatically increases, and by itg own increase increases, without any external stimulation, the absorptive capacity of the country. The provision in the Agreement for the direct absorption of migrants in proportion to the issue of loan money was added merely as a rough and necessarily imperfect criterion whereby it might be ascertained whether in fact the development carried out under the Agreement was increasing the absorptive capacity of the country. Brit the real results of the Agreement can only be judged, not so much by the absorption of migrants which takes place during its currency, as by the increase of migration which we hope will result after the development effected under it is completed. If this is so, a temporary check in the flow of migration while the Agreement is still in operation affords no argument for bringing the Agreement to an end; on the contrary, it is, if it is not quite irrelevant, an argument for prosecuting the work contemplated by the Agreement with greater vigour than before. This view is apparently shared by the Economic Mission (under the Chairmanship of Sir A. Duckham), who, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, visited Australia in 1928, for in paragraph 42 of their Report they recommend that the scope of the Agreement should be enlarged without a &quot; condition that any specific proportionate number of migrants must be received in Australia.&quot;. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree that our reply to Mr. Scullins telegram should make it clear that we do not mean to stick to the letter of our bargain with no regard to its spirit. I do not, however, recommend that we should agree without qualification to continue to contribute in respect of any scheme which may be submitted to us under the Agreement.The Agreement may be considered from three aspects, namely, in regard to schemes already completed under it, in regard to schemes now in course of completion, and in regard to future schemes, work on which has not yet been begun.As regards schemes already completed, while, as I have stated above, two States (South Australia and Western Australia) have not yet achieved the full quota of migrants they are required to absorb, the other States have already greatly exceeded their quota. It would be open to us, if we so desired, to inform Mr. Scullin that we shall hold South Australia and Western Australia to their bargain and shall demand from the Commonwealth Government a refund of a proportionate amount of our expenditure if their quota is not complete by 1935; but, quite apart from the fact that I think it is pretty certain that their quota will be complete by that date, I do not anticipate that my colleagues Avill desire that we should follow this course.As regards schemes now in course of Completion, I attach (Appendix II) a list showing the schemes on which expenditure has already been incurred and the amounts which we may expect to be called on to pay if the schemes are completed. I am advised that all of these schemes will make a direct contribution to the absorptive capacity of Australia. Furthermore, we are, in my opinion, definitely pledged, by our acceptance of the schemes under the Agreement, to make the contributions provided in the Agreement; and, in fact, in the case of the schemes in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, the number of assisted migrants already settled in these States is amply sufficient to cover their obligations in respect of this additional contingent expenditure. For this reason, in addition to the reasons I have already given above, I think we should make it clear to Mr. Scullin that we do not contemplate withholding future contributions in respect of these schemes.There remains the question of future schemes. As regards these, I think that we should reserve a completely free hand, but that we should at the same time make it clear that we are prepared to give careful and sympathetic consideration to the question of co-operating in any such scheme as to which we are satisfied that it will make a real contribution to the absorptive capacity of the country with a view to the resumption of assisted migration at the earliest possible date.If, however, we decide (as I hope my colleagues will decide) to meet Mr. Scullin to this extent, I think we may fairly press him to meet us on certain points. The most important of these is that he should agree to keep the machinery of assisted [20145] B 2
migration, both in this country and in Australia, in existence. Such machinery is easy to scrap and difficult to reconstruct. Its disappearance would mean that there would be an additional and considerable obstacle to the resumption of operations under the Assisted Passage Agreement. The best way of keeping such machinery in existence is by maintaining at least a trickle of migration; and for this reason, and also because the arguments against the continuance at present of other forms of assisted migration do not, I think, apply in this case, I should propose to press Mr. Scullin to reconsider the possibility of making an additional exception in favour of the grant of assisted passages to women going out to engage in domestic work. There are other points with which I need not trouble my colleagues at present.There is, of course, the position of the States to be considered. It will be seen from Mr. Crutchley&apos;s telegrams that pressure is already being brought to bear by the State Governments on the Commonwealth Government to modify their decision to suspend assisted migration, if the assistance of the British Government in obtaining loan money at a cheap rate is no longer available. This view is borne out by a further telegram received from Mr. Crutehley, of which I append a copy (Appendix III), and by Press messages which have appeared in this country as to statements made by the Premier of South Australia. It might be argued from this that it would be tactically wise to decline further co-operation with the Common-wealth Government under the Agreement in the hope that, in that event, pressure by the States will impel the Commonwealth Government to modify their policy. I do not, however, believe that any pressure which may be exercised by the States will have that effect, so that the result of the adoption of such a course by us would be to alienate the Commonwealth Government without achieving any counterbalancing advantage. Furthermore, I think it likely that, if cheap loan money is still made available to the States, they, or some of them, Avill nevertheless continue to press for the resumption of assisted passages. I should, indeed, not be surprised if Western Australia did not approach us direct with a proposal for a separate Assisted Passage Agreement with them. It will be time enough to consider what our reply should be if and when such an approach is made; we could not, in any case, comply with it unless the Commonwealth Government fully concurred.It must be recognised that, apart from the direct effect on migration from this country of the Commonwealth Governments decision, various indirect and unfortunate results will arise. The fact that our present training centres for agricultural workers are used both for Australia and for Canada, and that the seasons for the two countries are different, has enabled us to keep the centres full during the whole year; whether it will be worth while to continue them for part of the year only will be a matter for consideration. Similarly, it will be a matter for consideration what is to be done with the Market Harborough Training Centre for Australian domestic workers. The cutting off of our only outlet for child emigration, and of one of the largest outlets for the emigration of youths, will be a serious blow to Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes and other voluntary organisations of the kind. These, however, are administrative questions with which I need not trouble the Cabinet.I annex (Appendix IV) drafts of telegrams which I should propose to send to Mr. Scullin and to Mr. Crutchley should the proposals I have made in this memorandum be approved by my colleagues. I should be glad of authority to send telegrams in accordance with these drafts.P.Dominions Office, November 13, 1929.
(i.)Telegram from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, dated November 4, 1929.(Received Dominions Office 4-54 jp.m. November 4, 1929.)(Priority, No. 232, Secret and Confidential.)MY Government, after full discussion with Crutchley and with Development and Migration Commission regarding present position of assisted migration and of  34,000,000 Agreement, is of opinion that, having regard to the serious unemploy-ment position at present existing in Australia, accentuated by the drop in price of Australia^ principal staples, namely, wool, and shortage in wheat crop due to unfavourable season, it cannot at present be responsible for a continuance of assisted migration into Australia, except for dependants of people already in Australia. My Government realises that the  34,000,000 Agreement is largely dependent on continuance of Assisted Passage Agreement. It has had under consideration the recommendation of the British Economic Mission concerning financial co-operation under the  34,000,000 Agreement between the British and Australian Governments for intensification of production in the better rainfall areas of Australia, without corresponding migration responsibility on the part of the Australian Governments. My Government is in full sympathy with better distribution of the white population of the Empire, and desires it to be understood that this present proposal is due to the existing unfavourable economic position in Australia. With full appreciation of the difficult position of Australia at the present time, my Government feels that it must ask your Government to agree to suspension of Assisted Passage Agreement immediately, except for the reunion of families, leaving it to your Government to decide upon the effect of this suspension upon activities under the  34,000,000 Agreement or any modification thereof that may be mutually arranged, and that this suspension should operate pending full discussion of all possible means of co-operation between our respective Governments at the next Imperial Conference. My Government is not communicating on these matters with the respective State Governments of Australia pending your reply to these representations, but would propose to immediately thereafter make representations to the Governments of the States. My Government proposes to give close attention to all measures of develop-ment which will have the most immediate effect in improving the general economics of Australian production, and thereby primarily relieving the present severe unemployment and financial position and pave the way towards providing oppor-tunities for suitable British settlers, and would heartily welcome co-operation of your Government in every possible direction in these matters. Scullin.(ii.)Telegram from the British Government Representative for Migration in Atistralia,dated Melbourne, November 5, 1929.(Received in Oversea Settlement Department 11-15 a.m., November 5, 1929.)IN continuation of my telegram of yesterday, I saw Prime Minister with Senator Daly. Development and Migration Commission, who had earlier interview, remained present. Prime Minister started by announcing Governments decision to suspend assisted migration, giving reasons. He asked me to make it clear to the Secretary of State that his Government wanted to maintain the high percentage of British in Australian people, and mentioned as a secret that he was arranging to cut down immigration from EurojDe. He found himself more in sympathy with Great Britain to-day than he had ever done, owing to Labour Government being in power. He mentioned particularly his sympathy with British attitude on preference. I mention this to give the atmosphere. Prime Minister was most courteous, considerate and statesmanlike in his treatment of the matter, but it wasAPPENDIX I.
evident at the outset that the Government was determined to carry out election pledges on migration. I argued fully on the lines of the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 26th October, handing Prime Minister text of policy portion. I said suspension of assistance would cause my Government much concern, and I put up specially good case for boys, but the Prime Minister repeatedly mentioned unemploy-ment among migrants as important factor in Government decision. He added that Australian boys would fill the vacancies on the land if they had the advantage of organisations like the Big Brother Movement. I urged the importance of leaving provision for cheap reunion of families, and on this the Prime Minister gave way, but on women and other classes was firm. I was then asked how the British Govern-ment would regard the decision as affecting the Commonwealth Loan Agreement. I said that they would consider the question with all possible sympathy; that they had for many months been expecting suggestions for amending the agreement oh the lines Of the British Economic Mission Report to encourage intensive rather than extensive development (a policy of which Prime Minister said that he was a most enthusiastic advocate), together with a modification in the present absorption responsibility of the States. But I said my own feeling was that, as assisted migration was the basis of the Agreement, public opinion in Great Britain would not support important contributions in time of financial stringency if (that) con-sideratiOn were entirely removed. Prime Minister quite saw this point. In original telegram which was drafted by Gepp, British Government were definitely asked to take long view and continue to work Commonwealth Loan Agreement. The words actually used in the message were the Prime Minister&apos;s own. He said that it was unfair to ask the British Government to continue its share of a bargain if Australia unprepared to do hers.I feel that it would be useless to contest the suggestion to suspend assisted migration, except for reunion of families, pending discussion at the Imperial Conference. We should leave pressure for modification of this policy to come from the States. There arfe already indications that this pressure will be forthcoming if cheap money ho longer available. I recommend suspension of Commonwealth Loan Agreement tmtil Imperial Conference, leaving unmentioned for the moment the question of payments on undertakings already approved and Other points of detail. Gepp was inclined to argue that the States with what he calls credit of migrants were entitled to further loan moneys, but I contested this on the ground that the test of each scheme was that it would &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; directly contribute towards settle-ment of suitable assisted migrants,&quot; and that, logically, if there were no assisted migrants there could be no scheme. Gepp described this view as extraordinary, but the Prime Minister and Daly seemed to sympathise.I dealt at length with the Victoria Scheme and the need for review of others. Government will, I think, try to get independent enquiry if Secretary of State reopens the matter in his reply. I have not yet received copy of the Prime Ministers message and may have more to say when it comes, but I saw what I believe to be the final draft.   Full despatch follows. Crutchley.(iii.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Prime Minister ofthe Commonwealth of Australia.(Sent 2-10 p.m. November 8, 1929.)(No. 189.)Kindlier, Canberra. (Secret and Confidential.)I WILL bring your telegram No. 232, Secret and confidential, of 4th November before my colleagues at the earliest possible moment, and I can assure you that it will receive our most careful consideration and that we fully appreciate your difficulties.   I will telegraph further as soon as possible. Passfield.
Telegram from the British Government Representative for Migration,dated Melbourne, November 9, 1929. ;(Received in Ojersea Settlement Department, 10-35 a.m., November 9, 1929.) (Secret, Personal.)ANYTHING you can do to keep Development and Migration Commission from destruction will be most useful for the future of Australia. Utterances of Sir Hugo Hirst in London after election were well received here and his relationswith labour leaders were.....Private telegrams from him to the Prime Ministerreferring to those utterances and conveying opinions of the mission as to the value of the Development and Migration Commission, and coming on top of Collier&apos;s impressive statement to that effect, might have steadying effect. Future of Council of Scientific Research is assured, but they refuse to assume any of the functions of Development and Migration Commission. Crutchley.(v.) &apos;Telegram from the British Government Representative for Migration, dated Melbourne, November 9, 1929.(Received in Oversea Settlement Department, 11-15 a.m., November 9, 1929.)YOUR secret telegram received. There are signs that Government is wavering about definite stoppage of assisted migration. Premier, South Australia, West Australia, and New South Wales, have criticised the policy, and Prime Minister is reported to-day as saying that in regard to the protests of Premier of New South Wales : &apos;&apos; There has been no suspension of assisted migration. Only action taken has been to communicate with British Government on the matter. In our communication we said that as soon as we received a reply we would consult with the State Ministries on the whole question. It was only natural that we should confer with British Government first.&quot; Suggest, therefore, no further action until after Monday&apos;s Loan Council Meeting, and further interview I am having with the Minister Tuesday, after which I will telegraph further. Collier has paid high compliments to the service in his State of the Development and Migration Commission. This has circulated widely and is believed to be shaking the Govern-ment on the question of the Commissions abolition. Gepp feels to-day that if the British Government pressed for retaining assisted migration, limited, pending the Imperial Conference, entirely to domestics and boys in addition to re-union of families, the points might be conceded. I feel bound to pass this on, but I still think such pressure should be left to the State Governments, and that British Government should avoid steps which may be taken as incurring measures of responsibility for unemployment, although as regards well-chosen domestics, risk of unemployment in any State seems negligible. Crutchley.

APPENDIX IV.(i)Draft Telegram to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia.(Secret and Confidential.)YOUR telegram No. 232, Secret and Confidential, of 4th November. While my colleagues and I naturally regret your decision to suspend the operation of the Assisted Passage Agreement except for the reunion of families, we recognise the difficulties with which you are faced and are anxious to assist you in every way in our power.It is with this consideration in mind that we have approached the question of the effect of your decision upon activities under the  34,000,000 Agreement.In the circumstances set out in. your telegram, and in a sincere desire to assist you in the difficult situation with which you are for the time being confronted, we are prepared to co-operate with you in the completion of schemes already approved under the Agreement by making the contributions provided therein as and when they fall due without consideration of the fact that assisted migration is temporarily suspended.As regards schemes already submitted to us and not yet approved, and schemes which are now or may in future be under consideration by the Development and Migration Commission with a view to their submission to us under the Agreement, we must reserve complete discretion, but we can assure you that we shall give the most careful and sympathetic consideration to any such scheme submitted to us with the approval of the Commission and of our representative, which may appear likely to increase the absorptive capacity of Australia with a view to the resumption of. assisted migration at as early a date as possible.We trust, however, that, in view of the co-operation which we are ready to extend on the above lines, your Government will, on their part, be willing to take the following points into consideration :  (a.) We hope that it will be found possible to keep the assisted migration machinery in being both in this country and in Australia by allowing some forms of assisted migration, however small, to continue so as to facilitate the resumption of activities under the Assisted Passage Agree-ment as soon as circumstances justify that course.(&amp;.) In this connection we should like to call particular attention to the existing arrangements for the assisted migration of household workers. We do not understand whether it is your view that the assisted migration of women from this country to undertake domestic work in Australia adversely affects the employment situation, and it will no doubt be borne in mind that considerable expenditure has been incurred by both Governments in the establishment of a training centre at Market Harborough. We should greatly regret the necessity of closing down this centre, and we trust, therefore, that, in addition to the exception in favour of the reunion of families, you will feel able to make a further exception in favour of female domestic workers.(c.) We have been, as I think you are aware, greatly disturbed as to the position of a number of British settlers in Victoria, and we earnestly hope that your Government will be able at an early date to take such steps as may be necessary to put these settlers in a satisfactory economic position. Mr. Crutchley is in possession.of our views in this matter, and will, of course, be available to discuss it with you at any time.My colleagues and I have not thought it necessary in this telegram to say anything as to our general policy in regard to British settlement within the Empire, as we have no doubt that Mr. Crutchley has put our views fully before you, nor do[20145] c
I propose now to. send the despatch referred to in my telegram No. 185 of the 26th October last. We trust you will continue to make full use of Mr. Crutchley&apos;s services in any matter which may arise.A copy of this telegram has been sent to Mr. Crutchley.mDraft Telegram to Mr. Crutchley.(Confidential.)I AM sending in a separate telegram text of a telegram addressed to the Prime Minister in reply to his telegram of the 4th November, copy of which you have no doubt seen.On careful consideration of the whole question, in which your telegrams of the 5th November and subsequent dates gave valuable assistance, Cabinet decided that it would be wise, from the economic no less than the political point of view, to agree to continuance of financial co-operation under the Agreement in respect of existing schemes and, while reserving complete freedom of discretion, to hold out strong hope of continued co-operation in respect of future schemes. They felt that the fact that it was found necessary owing to the present economic position of Australia to suspend assisted migration was a strong reason for affording any assistance possible under the Agreement towards shortening the period of suspension, and that, politically, it was desirable to make it clear to the new Government that we are ready and anxious to give them all possible help in the difficult situation in which they are placed. Due weight was given to the consideration that the withdrawal of facilities for obtaining cheap money would lead to.pressure from the States for modification of policy of suspension of assisted passages, but it was felt that such pressure was likely in any case to be ineffective, and, further, that it might continue to be exerted at any rate by some of the States, even if cheap money continued to be ayailable.Cabinet agreed with your view that Gepp&apos;s argument that States with credit of migrants are entitled to further loan monies was wholly inadmissible, and you should take any opportunity which may arise to make it clear that we regard our offer of continuance of financial co-operation as an expression of our desire to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government and not as the payment of a debt to which we are pledged.You will observe that we seize the occasion to ask for consideration of certain specified points, and you should endeavour to impress upon Mr. Scullin that we feel that we have gone a very long way to meet him, and that we expect him to make every effort to meet us. In particular, we shall feel that our attitude has not been adequately recognised unless the Victoria situation is fully and satisfactorily cleared up.There is one further point which you should raise if you think politic to do so, and not   otherwise. I have stated at (a) in my telegram to Mr. Scullin that we are anxious to keep migration machinery in existence by the maintenance at least of a trickle of assisted migration. In addition to continuance of assisted passages for women, we should like to keep open the grant of nominations. It could be pointed out that final approval in each individual case rests solely with State Governments, who would presumably have regard to the existing economic situation, and that, even if this method of control were so tightened as to reduce nominations to an insignificant number, the fact that the system was at any rate nominally still in existence would have a good effect.As regards the future, you will observe that we promise careful and sympathetic consideration to any scheme approved by Commission and by you which may appear likely to increase absorptive capacity of Australia with a view to early resumption of assisted migration. We regard it as essential that Commission should remain in being at any rate for the purpose of investigating proposed schemes under the Agreement, and that you, as our representative, should continue to hold a position which will be recognised as being advantageous to the Commonwealth Government no less than to us. We should not be prepared to contemplate financial co-operation in future schemes unless these conditions obtain. As regards the policy which you should follow in the scrutiny of future schemes, I can only say at present that we shall require to be satisfied even more fully than hitherto that any such scheme is a
direct and substantial contribution towards, increasing the absorptive capacity of Australia, so that when the present suspension is removed there will be some likelihood that the flow of migrants will be sufficient to compensate for its temporary suspension. -      &apos;Finally, you should avail yourself of such opportunities as may arise to leave no doubt in Mr. Sctdlin&apos;s mind that we have proceeded under the assumption that his Government firmly intends to resume grant of assisted passages as soon as economic situation in Australia permits, and that our readiness to continue co-operation under the Agreement is based whollv on this assumption. If at any time we had reason to suppose that suspension was being maintained on other than economic grounds, our attitude would be materially affected.o
