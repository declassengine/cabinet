[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT].SECRET. Copy No,,C,P. CABINET.,MEMORANDUM by the PRESIDENT of the BOARD OF EDUCATION.RAISING    THE    SCHOOL   AGE.The first Resolution on Wednesday, the 13thNovember, is down in the name of Sir Donald Maclean andruns as follows&quot;Education, - To call attention to the Government policy with regard to Education, with special reference to the raising of the school age; * and to move , - That this House urges the Government to bring forward without delay the details of its scheme for raising the school age, especially the financial proposals connected therewith, so that local education authorities may know what their obligations are likely to be and further urges that any changes in the existing law that require legislations shall at once be put in the form of a Bill and presented to this House,&quot;This has been put down with a quite friendly intention but it raises certain points of importance to which I must give a considered reply.One point deals with the financial proposals connected with the raising of the school age.     This refers principally to the question of maintenance allowances and I am certain to be asked to give details as to the intention of the Government.I am still discussing the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     I should be satisfied if I could be permitted to say that various questions in connection with it are still under consideration, that  -the provision of maintenance grants is an integral part of the policy of the Government, and that in view of the new charge on the Local Authorities , entailed in giving the allowances , the House nay rely upon the Exchequer not making a mean contribution.
But the main object for which the Resolution has been put down is to obtain information as to when the Government intend to produce the Bill.      I must inform my colleagues that I am being very severely pressed for the production of the Bill and very severely criticized for the dc in producing it.. There are some Local Education Authorities who are refusing and will continue to refuse to take any definite steps in the re-organisation which is necessary to meet the raising of the school leaving age until they are assured- that the legislation will pass.      This is the excuse of unfriendly Local Education Authorities , and it is unquestionably serious as London is one of them.But the production of the Measure is also being urged by large numbers of our own supporters,by friendly newspapers, by even the most friendly Local Education Authorities and Education Directors and by the National Union of Teachers.      Therefore I very much hope that I may receive the permission of the Cabinet to announce on Wednesday that I shall introduce the Bill shortly.      It would be wise also if we made up our minds to get a Second Heading for it as soon as possible, for I am pretty sure that it would save time  in the end if we could get through the main stage of it before hostile elements had time to develop further.     It will be a One -Clause Bill and it could hardly take more than two days on Second Reading.Moreover, there is going to be an almost irresistible argument for its production when the minister of Labour produces her proposal for lowering the age of insurance.      Some educational opinion is still unreconciled to that policy and it is quite liKely that there may grow up a general opposition of the kind which defeated our project  in 1924, unless we secure that both of the proposals are simultaneously before Parliament,
I shall, no doubt, have to repeat      on Wednesday-cur attitude towards the voluntary school problem which I stated in reply to Questions the other day, namely that we cannot propose any changes in the law unless and until there is an agreed solution.      I have not yet been approached by any representatives of the ohief religious organisations to call a conference.C.T.11th November, 1929.
