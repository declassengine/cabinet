C.P. 359 (29). [W 11285/50/98]MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET. Arbitration Treaties.DURING the course of the past year consideration lias - been given to the desirability of renewing tbe arbitration treaties concluded with France and Italy on the 14th October, 1903, and the 1st February, 1904, respectively, which have recently expired. These treaties provide for arbitration on justiciable disputes only, and in view of the fact that both France and Italy have signed tbe Optional CJausc it appears not to be necessary to renew these treaties. I would therefore propose, if my colleagues concur, to inform tbe French and Italian Governments that, in the opinion of Bis Majesty&apos;s Government, the signature of tbe Optional Clause both by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the French and Italian Governments has rendered the renewal of these treaties unnecessary, all three Governments being by their signature of tbe Optional Clause committed to refer to arbitration by the Permanent Court of International Justice the classes of disputes enumerated in the treaties.1 have also recently received proposals from Denmark, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland for tbe institution of negotiations for tbe conclusion of bilateral treaties of arbitration, i.e., treaties providing for the pacific settlement of all classes of disputes. Our old arbitration treaties with these countries have recently expired, or will shortly do so. It may be recalled that we have already made one such treaty with Uruguay.Each of these countries has signed the Optional Clause, and therefore the field of justiciable disputes between this country and each of them will be covered as soon as our signature of the Optional Clause is made effective by ratification. As regards non-justiciable disputes, the field would similarly be covered when we and the countries concerned have become parties to the General Act.The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the General Act is now under consideration, but in any case it is not anticipated that we can sign it before the 1930 Assembly. It might, however, be possible to conclude before that date bilateral treaties with some or all of the five countries concerned somewhat on the lines of the model bilateral convention for the pacific settlement of all international disputes. While the questions which would have to be considered in connexion with the signature of such treaties are in principle identical with those which arise in connexion with the General Act, it may well be that they are in practice less difficult, since we are not likely to be involved in disputes with any of the five countries in question of a nature which will call for special consideration in connexion with the General Act. For the same reason the preliminary consultation with the Dominions which would be necessary before any such bilateral treaties could be concluded may well take less time than that which would be involved before the signature of the General Act.The General Act is at present under consideration by a Foreign Office committee under tbe chairmanship of Lord Cecil, and I should like to instruct the committee to consider simultaneously the possibility of concluding bilateral treaties of this nature with some or all of the countries concerned without waiting for a final decision as to the General Act. I ask, therefore, for Cabinet authority to proceed on the above lines and to return replies to the five countries in question explaining the position and indicating the action which His Majesty&apos;s Government are taking.In making this recommendation I wish to make it clear that I am not advising any modification of the policy of accepting the General Act. On the contrary, I believe that that is essential to a satisfactory peace policy. No doubt when the question of the signature of the General Act comes- to be considered by Parliament questions of principle may be raised which may not have been disposed of by the signature of these bilateral treaties.A. H.Foreign Ojjice, December 4, 1929.5134 [20247]SECRET. Copy No.    37
