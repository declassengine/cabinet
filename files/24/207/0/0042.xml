[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1929.SECRET.CP. 351 (29).CABINET.THE  POLITICAL  SITUATION IN INDIA.&apos;   MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate for the information of my colleagues three documents indicating the effect on political opinion in India of the Vjcer6y&apos;s Statement, issued on 1st November, and of subsequent events connected with it.The first is an extract from a letter from the Government of India&apos;s Director of Public Information, written only a few days after the issue of the Statement. The second and third are private telegrams from Lord Irwin of 17th and 26th. November respectively, giving his appreciation of the situation in the former in the light of the repercussions of the Parliamentary debates here, in the second in the light of the conference of political leaders which took place at Allahabad on 18tli-21st November.A further opportunity for reviewing the situation will be afforded by the reports of the proceedings of the Indian National Congress which will take place in the last two weeks of December.W. B.2nd December 1929.I.Extract from a letter from Mr. Coatman, the Director of Public Information, Government of India, dated Delhi, 7th November 1929.As you must, of course, have read in the newspapers, one of the most important events of recent years in India has taken place within the last few days, namely, His Excellency the Viceroy&apos;s statement relating to the goal of India&apos;s political develop-ment and containing the offer of a conference to be held after the publication of the Simon Report at which it is hoped that the Indian Princes and all sections of British Indian political opinion will be represented. I might begin my exposition of the situation as it now is by explaining the importance of that part of His Excellency&apos;s announcement which affirms that Dominion Status is the natural goal of Indian political development. The popular view of this part of the announcement appears to be that held by Lord Birkenhead when be stated that if this declaration concerning Dominion Status represents a new development in the policy of.the British Govern-nient towards India it trenches on the field of the Simon Commission. If it does not represent any new development then it is superfluous. It does not of course represent any new development, and yet it is far from superfluous. The &apos;: responsible self-government &quot; mentioned in the declaration of 1917 cannot of course mean anything but what is now conveniently called Dominion Status, and there can be no doubt that all who have played any important part in Indian politics whether Indians or British have always understood it in this sense. But lately, for a variety of reasons, the suspicion has become fairly general in India that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment was trying to whittle down the declaration of 1917, and undonbtedby. a good deal of our recent troubles in this country can trace their origin back to this suspicion. His Excellency Lord Irwin devoted an appreciable portion of his speech to the Central Legislature last January to an attempt to dispel this suspicion. The authoritative statement contained in his recent announcement has now entirely dispelled the old suspicion and it has given wide satisfaction in this country. The comments in the Indian Press on this point are sufficient proof of the importance attached by Indian opinion to it.The other part of the announcement, namely, that containing the offer of a Conference, may be said to implement the other part which refers to Dominion Status as India&apos;s natural goal. By this I do not, of course, mean that the Conference will be able to bring India to complete Dominion Status immediately. This is neither expected nor desired by the more moderate elements in India, and I gravely doubt if it is desired even by the majority of the Congressmen. When the Conference meets, however strong^ the left wing of Indian politics is represented, the practical 4113     75  12.29
difficulties, indeed the insuperable obstacles, to immediate Dominion Status are bound to exert a moderating influence even on the extremists, and I for one expect that a satisfactory and workmanlike agreement will be arrived at between the majoritv, at any rate, of the Indian delegates to the Conference and the representatives of&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Iudian Government. One thing can be said with confidence even at this early stage, and that is that the whole of what we might call the right wing of the centre of Indian politics and even certain elements, namely, the Muhammadans, who at present belong to the Congress or left wing, will accept any reasonable statement even though the actual date of India&apos;s attainment of Dominion Status is left uncertain and not even in the near future. \Vhat is wanted by all these groups of opinion is a constitution which, when time and circumstances are ripe, . Can evolve naturally into a constitution similar to those possessed by the existing self-governing Dominions of the Empire. I have had a number of talks with important leaders of these sections and also with persons in constant and close touch with them, and I am quite satisfied that my reading of their point of view is correct. The manner in which they have accepted the announcement and the comments of the great majority of Indian-owned newspapers on it, show clearly that the announcement has not only satisfied them but has to a certain extent even captured their imagination, and in certain quarters very warm feelings of admiration, and indeed it. is not too much to say of some people, even affection, for His Excellency, Lord Irwin, have been engendered. To one who reads the statement issued by those political leaders who met at Delhi on Friday and Saturday the 1st and 2nd of November, my remarks may seem unduly optimistic, but the statement itself requires a certain amount of interpretation for those who are not actually in touch with events here. So far from representing a swing towards the left on the part of the leaders of the moderate sections of Indian political thought it represents a distinct movement towards the right on the part of the extreme Congressmen. At the end of the first day&apos;s meeting, that is, Friday, November the 1st, nobody could have predicted that such a statement would be issued the next day, signed by everybody present except the rigid extremist and opportunist, Subash Chandra Bhosh. For on Friday, Mr. Gandhi, Pundit Motilal Nehru and his son Javvaharlal Nehru, who has hitherto been identified with the most extreme elements in Indian politics, stood out for the acceptance by the Indian Government of certain conditions precedent to their co-operation in the Conference. These conditions have been stated in the newspapers, of which you will receive the cuttings, and 1 need not go into them here. This attempt to bargain was expected of these Congress leaders, and, indeed, if they had stuck to their conditions it would have been no more than consistent with their previous actions and declarations. But on Saturday afternoon they waived these conditions and agreed to put them into the statement as recommendations. That Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru are prepared to co-operate on any terms whatever is a development of the very highest significance and it is worth while looking for its causes. the first thing that shook the Congress leaders was the obviously unshakable determination of the right wing and even the centre parties in Indian politics to accept the announce-ment unconditionally. This showed that they were in danger of being isolated from the rest of political India. But worse from their point of view was to follow. At the end of the first day&apos;s discussion it had become obvious that the Muhammadaus belonging to the Congress party were determined to throw in their lot with the more moderate elements. Again, on Saturday morning the news reached Delhi of a very important meeting of political leaders held the previous evening in Bombay, at which the announcement was unconditionally accepted. Among these leaders were one or two Congress people, and so the Congress leaders in Delhi realised that the Muhammadans, important as they were, would not be the only elements to secede from the Congress in this matter. Thus Gandhi and the two Nehrus were faced not only with isolation, but with the disruption of their party, and so in the end they had to come to terms with the moderate section. We ma3r take it as fairly certain that the civil disobedience planned for 1st January will be postponed, and also that for the present, at any rate, the independent movement which has been gaining steadily of late months is completely immobilised. The response of the Press in this country, both Indian and European, is strikingly unanimous. Nowhere has there been any suggestion that the announcement should be rejected and the proposed Conference boycotted. On the contraiy, even the most extreme newspapers clearly show a desire to do. nothing that.will absolutely ruin the Conference, although, of course, they would like to bargain. It is very doubtful, however, if these attempts to bargain will be carried to the extent of endangering the Conference.    There are even some
o oIndian newspapers which outdo the European newspapers iu their welcome to the announcement, and I might point out that the absolute unanimity of the European section of the Press in its support of Lord Irwin is&apos;a phenomenon which could hardly have been expected a few months ago. Briefly, a complete change has come over the political scene in India, a change infinitely for the better.II.Private telegram from the Viceroy, dated 17th November 1929.There has now been time to assess the reactions of the Parliamentary debates on the position here, and I consider that the general situation is encouraging. The Indian Press has on the whole been friendly ancl even the most extreme papers have avoided the suggestion of boycotting the Conference on the grounds that His Majesty&apos;s Government have rejected the conditions on which political leaders preferred co-operation in their- Delhi declaration. A. few Congress papers warn readers of British cunning and stress the need of wariness.The debate in the Commons and particularly your own speech relieved the tension caused in many quarters by the Lords debate, and neither the Prime Ministers reply to Baldwin regarding the policy laid clown in the Preamble to the Act nor your reply regarding amnesty for political prisoners seems to be very seriously called in question here.Moderate organs remain enthusiastic over the announcement and Congress papers are obviously steering clear of any comment or action which imperil the chances of the Conference taking place.2. I think that the foregoing analysis of the Press reflects pretty fairly the general feeling in the country. Our friends seem pleased, and such Moslem apprehensions as there may have been that they might be thrown to the wolves are, I think, subsiding. I have received messages from various Associations, including the Assam Ex-Service Men&apos;s, and from individuals expressing warm approval of the step taken. The support of the Liberals and Moderates is firm, and without conditions; Sapru&apos;s signature of the Delhi declaration is, I believe, explained by his desire to keep in with the extremer elements as long as possible, in order to exert his moderating influence on them.Congress are having committee meetings to-day and on Monday, and it is uncertain what they will do. But, if under the influence of Jawaharlal Nehru and SubashBose, they issue too uncompromising a statement against the announcement, moderates like Saprn will probably break.with them. I shall not be surprised if the majority of the Congress ends by going wrong, but I am sure there are many elements that will do their best to make it go right, and it remains to be seen whether Congress itself will split on this issue.Meanwhile, it is all to the good that the people seem to be directing their thoughts -more and more to the Conference as the immediately important thing.III.Private telegram from the Viceroy, dated 26th November 1929.Private and personal. My appreciation of the present political situation, following on the recent Congress meetings at Allahabad, is that the resolutions there made represent for the moment success for Moderate element. To draw conclusions from this about the final decision would, however, be rash. So far as Congress is concerned, decision has merely been postponed till Christmas, but issue will have to be fought out then.2. Liberals and other Moderate elements appear to he quite determined to maintain their attitude of genuine co-operation ; they have got what they want in the offer of Round Table Conference, which has extricated them from false position; and they are not likely to jeopardise their gain by insisting on conditions which do not greatly interest them. At the other extreme come Jawaharlal and Subhas Bose, depending for their position on the &quot;young men who could be satisfied by no conceivable, concessions. I fancy that Jawaharlal and Subhas Bose feel they must insist as minimum on amnesty to those whom: they have encouraged to violent
courses.   They also presumably realise that whoever weakens uow will lose support of the young men.3. Between these extremes comes the main body of older Congressmen, represented by Motilal and Gandhi. They probably realise that, if Governments offer is rejected, revolutionary policy of civil disobedience, &amp;c, will probably follow, aud this they are anxious to avoid. At the same time, they will do everything possible * to avoid a split in Congress ranks. They will probably, therefore, try to avoid closing door to co-operation with Government, while at the same time uttering sufficient threats to satisfy young men. If they fail in this difficult task, they will either have to surrender to young men or split Congress. Which course they would adopt it is impossible to foretell.5
