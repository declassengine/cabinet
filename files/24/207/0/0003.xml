this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;8 government.Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.VEEY CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 313 (29).Memorandum respecting the conversations between Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and Mr. Mackenzie King during the visit to Ottawa (October 17-20, 1929).[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister.&quot;]THE visit to Canada lasted from the 15th October to the 25th October. A report on the itinerary we followed, the public functions we attended and the character of the welcome we received is being furnished by His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner for the United Kingdom at Ottawa. On this point I would only say that the arrangements made for our comfort were excellent throughout, that the hospitality we received was boundless, and that we were accorded a warm welcome everywhere, not only in the official world but from private clubs and organisations and from all with whom we came in contact. I understand that Mr. Mackenzie King was himself largely responsible for these splendid arrange-ments, and I deeply appreciate the care which he devoted to this matter and the generous hospitality for which the Federal Government and the Canadian National Railways made themselves responsible.My first opportunity for private discussions with Mr. Mackenzie King occurred on the afternoon of the 17th, when I drove with him to his country house at Kingsmere. On the afternoons of Friday the 18th and Saturday the 19th we had further conversations in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s room in the Department of External Affairs at Ottawa. On the two latter occasions the following were also present: Mr. James A. Robb, Minister of Finance; Colonel J. L. Ralston, Minister of National Defence; Sir Robert Vansittart and Mr. Craigie.Our discussions were of a perfectly frank and informal.character, and I was able to inform Mr. Mackenzie King fully of what had passed at Washington. The visit, following as it did immediately upon the visit to the United States, offered an excellent opportunity for co-ordinating our policy in regard to the important questions under review, and I am.glad to say that Mr. Mackenzie King and I found ourselves in substantial agreement on all points.I. Naval Question.I gave an account of the conversations at Rapidan and Washington (as outlined in my memorandum on the American visit), and explained fully the course of action we were proposing to follow. Mr. Mackenzie King appeared to be in full agreement on all points and cordially welcomed the prospect of an early settlement of the naval disarmament question at all events, as between the British Empire and the United States.II. Naval Stations in the Western Hemisphere.In explaining to Mr. Mackenzie King what had occurred at Washington, I made it clear that our proposed formula related only to stations under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and that such discussion as occurred with reference to Halifax was only designed to ascertain what was in the mind of Mr. Hoover and his advisers in order that the Canadian Government might be fully appraised of the situation.Mr. Mackenzie King saw no objection at all to the formula which I proposed in regard to the stations in the Caribbean area. He added that the Canadian Government would be perfectly prepared to make a similar declaration in regard to Halifax and Vancouver, subject to the right of effecting &quot; the necessary improve-ments and modernisation of these ports to meet the needs of Canadian defence and5705   [20127] b
-to facilitate the maintenance of Canadian neutrality&quot; (see telegram from British High Commissioner to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington of the 8th October&apos;  Appendix A). He made it clear, however, that Canada would require a corresponding declaration from the United States owing to the proximity of Unitedi States naval stations to the Canadian-United States border-a consideration which did not arise in the case of Great Britain. Mr. Mackenzie King indeed intimated plainly that no Canadian Government could dispense with such reciprocity and hope to survive. As I had been given to understand at Washington that there was little chance of the United States Government seeing their way to make a corresponding declaration, we came to the conclusion that any public statement which might ultimately be made on this subject would probably have to be confined to the Caribbean area. Before our departure from Washington, Colonel Stimson had requested Sir Robert Vansittart to let him know the view adopted by the:&apos; Canadian Government on this point as soon as possible after Mr. Mackenzie King and I had talked the matter over. A letter informing the United States Secretary of State of the Canadian attitude was accordingly drafted at the meeting and despatched on the 19th October.   The text of this letter appears as Appendix B.III. Rights and Immunities at Sea in Time of War.I found Mr. Mackenzie King fully in agreement with the view that this question should be examined in consultation with the United States Government after the naval question had been disposed of. He added that, as. one of the functions of Canada, in the event of the British Empire being involved in a war, would be to keep Great Britain supplied with food, the Canadian Government could only welcome . Mr. Hoover&apos;s scheme for declaring food-ships immune from capture in time of war.IV. Liquor Smuggling Question.After I had described to Mr. Mackenzie King what had passed at Washington on this subject and handed to him a copy of the Presidents memorandum (Appendix C), Mr. Mackenzie King told me that his Government were contem-plating the introduction of legislation making it an offence to export liquor to the United States. We were therefore able to add to Sir Robert VansittartS letter to Colonel Stimson a statement to the effect that the last paragraph of the Presidents memorandum correctly represents the intentions of the Canadian Government.We discussed the whole question fully, both in relation to Canada and Great Britain, and I impressed on Mr. Mackenzie King the importance, from the point of view of British shipping interests, of preserving the 1924 Treaty for the prevention of liquor smuggling. If the judicial decision in the &quot;I&apos;m Alone&quot; case were to go against the United States on the point of the admissibility of &quot;hot pursuit&quot; from within treaty limits, the treaty, which was far from popular in certain influential circles in the United States, would almost certainly become the object of a hostile campaign in the United States. Mr. Mackenzie King agreed With me in thinking that, should the decision prove adverse to the United States on this point, it would be well to consider carefully the desirability of spontaneously offering the United States the right of &quot;hot pursuit&quot; out of treaty limits.V. Date and Venue of the next Imperial Conference.Mr. Mackenzie King much hoped that it would prove agreeable to all concerned to hold the Economic Conference in Ottawa some time in September next. The Conference would be attended by the appropriate Cabinet Ministers but not by Prime Ministers. This would enable the economic questions to be dealt with as far as possible in advance of the main conference, although points could, of course, be reserved for final decision by the Imperial Conference in cases where this appeared necessary. The Imperial Conference could then meet in London at some convenient date in the following year (1931), its burden having been considerably lightened by the previous holding of the Economic Conference. Mr. Mackenzie King did not, however, desire to press unduly for the holding of the Economic Conference in Ottawa; He would agree to London if this course proved more generally acceptable, but he hoped that in this case there would be one and not two conferences, and thatTWWnWWMMBTCHIII Will IT------- &apos;-&apos;^-&apos;-,^.rv-,,i.;T.r&apos;-^-:: -&apos;:i:&quot;-?-2r?.,*rT
it would be held in 1931. - If London were to be the venue, he suggested that the Economic Conference should meet, say, one month in advance of the main conference, thus curtailing the period during which Prime Ministers (who would not be attending the Economic Conference) would require to be absent from home.I said I would discuss the proposed procedure with Lord Passfield as soontas I returned home and, if he agreed, would take the matter up with the other Dominion Governments.The conversations could only be provisional. The change of Government in Australia made a final agreement as to the assembly of the Economic Conference impossible, and until the Committee of Experts, now sitting upon the legal relation-ship of the Empire as affected by the resolution passed by the last Imperial Conference, had reported, we could only agree that the results may be of the most vital interest, not only to the Empire but to the whole world, and that, whatever is done, a unity of allegiance and spirit must be preserved with a development of nationality.VI. Increase in Canadian Tariff on certain Cotton Manufactures Imported   Jy-from Great Britain.I represented strongly to Mr. Mackenzie King the serious view taken in Lancashire of the recent increase in the percentage of the value of cotton goods which, must be due to British workmanship if the goods were to obtain the benefit of the Canadian preference. As the raw material for these particular goods could not be obtained from within the Empire, and as the raw material represented such an important element in the value of certain cotton manufactures, it would, in many instances and for many reasons, which I specified, be quite impossible for Lancashire to come within the new regulations, and the trade would accordingly be killed.Mr. Robb affected not to believe that any damage had actually been done to the trade, though he understood that Lancashire was apprehensive as to the harm that might be done. He then branched into reference to a British decision in regard to photographic apparatus, and pointed out that the percentage of British value for preference purposes had been raised from 25 to 75 per cent, on a recommendation of the Committee appointed under the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921. He quoted the following passage from the Committee&apos;s report, dated the 29th March, 1926 : &quot; Imports of duty-free cameras from Canada . *. ... have been very harmful to the British optical instrument industry.&apos;&apos; Mr. Robb considered that this drastic raising of the percentage, avowedly to keep out a product which was in the main Canadian, had done a lot of harm in Canada. It did not predispose Canadian manu-facturers to favour the grant of preference concessions to British manufacturers.Replying to Mr. Robb, I remarked that I felt sure that Lancashire would have no difficulty in proving that harm had actually been done to the industry, and that this was not a question of crying out before it had been hurt. I used all the well-known arguments upon this point, and there is no need to recapitulate them here. As regards photographic apparatus, I mentioned that the Committee to which he had referred was not a Government organisation but an advisory Committee appointed ad hoc, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no control over the wording of its report. The optical lens industry was one of the key industries, the preservation of which was regarded as vital for the purposes of the defence of the United Kingdom. The duties on the key industries were in an entirely different category from ordinary safeguarding or revenue-raising duties. I also endeavoured to show the essential difference between a preference percentage which was designed merely to keep out a cheap American lens, and which could be met by the substitution of a Canadian lens, and a preference percentage on cotton manufactures which, owing to the high cost of the raw material, operated so as definitely to bar certain types of British manufactures. No means was open to the Lancashire manu-facturers of complying with this new Canadian requirement. However, I promised Mr. Robb we would look into this lens question on my return to London.- The matter of the lens was, of course, only raised by Mr. Robb as a red herring, and has nothing to do with the real case at issue.After further discussion, during which I pressed Mr. Mackenzie King personally and strongly-seeing that he was better disposed and far less hesitant than Mr. Robb-the Prime Minister of Canada stated that it would-be necessary to follow the procedure of referring the matter to the Tariff Board, but that he would[20127] *5 2
-request the President of the Commission to expedite the hearings as much as possible., and to state whether evidence previously supplied by the Lancashire trade would be taken into account by the Commission. He telephoned in my presence to the President of the Commission and gave directions in this sense, urging him also, in my presence, to examine the British case as sympathetically as possible. It was arranged that this question should come up before the Board on the 9th November, and that every effort would be made to complete the enquiry and furnish a report within ten days. Mr. Mackenzie King said that he and his Government had every desire to see this question settled to our satisfaction.(Signed) J. RAMSAY MacDONALD.
APPENDIX A.British High Commissioner, Ottawa, to Sir E. Howard.(No. 15.   Very Confidential.) . r,(Telegraphic.)&apos; Ottawa, October 8, 1929.PRIME MINISTER of Canada asks me to communicate following reply to your telegram of 7th October: &quot;Canadian Government observes that Mr. Ramsay MacDonald proposes that Great Britain will not hereafter establish any military or naval stations in her possessions in the western hemisphere nor alter any such existing stations in such a way as in either case will become a menace to the United States. Canadian Government will if [ ? necessary] make a similar declaration in respect of Canadian territory. Necessary improvements and modernisation of Canadian Pacific and Atlantic ports to meet needs of Canadian defence and to facilitate maintenance of Canadian neutrality are understood to be, as they are intended, not a menace of any kind to the United States. Canadian Government considers that proposal to examine frankly and fully question of rights and immunities at sea is highly desirable and that suggestion of President of United States in respect of food ships merits examination.&quot;(Repeated to Dominions Office, telegram No. 17 of 8th October.)APPENDIX B.Sir R. Vansittart to Mr. Stimson. Dear Mr. Secretary, October 19, 1929.AS we were leaving you asked me to send you a line on the Ottawa sequel to the Washington conversations. I take this first opportunity of doing so. We have still one more day here, but I expect you will be glad of early information, since, owing to the fact that Mr. MacDonald&apos;s speech had to be delivered on the very day of his arrival, it was not possible to cover much ground. No doubt Campbell gave you my advance message to this effect. I telephoned to ask him to do so. Since then there has been a little more time, and Mr. MacDonald has been-able to give Mr. Mackenzie King a full account of the Washington proceedings, including, of course, the paragraphs which the President wished to add in regard to ships laden exclusively with food-stuffs. I may say that the idea of exempting food-ships has been received here with a great deal of interest, and will be examined in Ottawa as we promised it should be examined fn London. You will have noticed also that Mr. MacDonald in his speech went a step ahead in foreshadowing the joint examination provided for in the first of the eliminated paragraphs.The Prime Minister also discussed the question of the naval stations. It is, I think, clear from further close examination that the plan for the division of the world into two hemispheres will not be workable, and we shall have to think out some other way of laying the &quot; ghost &quot; of the so-called menace of the naval stations.The Canadian Government are willing in principle to announce simultaneously and jointly with us that their naval stations are not, and are not intended to be, a menace to the United States. This, however, could only be done if the same statement were made&quot; reciprocally by the United States. If this is, in your view, impossible, the agreement would then be confined to the Caribbean area. The wording of this statement would, as arranged, be settled between us. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald will go into this matter immediately upon his return to London.The intentions of the Canadian Government in regard to the refusal of clearance to vessels carrying liquor to the United States we found to agree with the last paragraph of the Presidents memorandum sent to me by Akerson on the 10th October; and an announcement will be made in due course by the Canadian Government of the action it proposes to take.I am,Yours very sincerely,R. G. VANSITTART.
APPENDIX C.Statement of&apos; Mr. Hoover&apos;s Views on United States-Canadian Relations.October 9, 1929.THE United States is making the most notable effort in all history to suppress alcoholic beverages. This effort is one that is of profound importance to the whole of humanity, and the United States is pioneering it in certain directions, and is,, therefore, doing service to all nations. It would appear that it should receive the sympathetic support of other nations, for, whether it succeeds or not, it will at least have exhausted some portion of the wide variety of methods for the remedy of a great human evil.We have had numerous conferences with Canadian authorities with respect to measures that could be taken Eo assist in suppression of the flow of alcoholic beverages over the border. The Canadian authorities have co-operated to the extent of giving information to the American officials as to proposed shipments, and in other ways which have been most helpful. However, so long as the Canadian Government allows liquor to be cleared for American ports or allows their clearance for other ports when really destined for the United States, there will be a constant stream of Canadian liquor into the United States. It is not possible, on 3,000 miles of frontier, to erect sufficient border patrol to prevent it because the initiative is always in the hands of the smuggler.This movement of liquor is the source of constant friction between the two nations. Only desperate men of criminal type engage upon it. They are criminals under the laws of the United States. They go armed, and often arm their ships. Such equipment is an indication of their intent to kill, and they have often killed the United States officers. It is impossible on our side to employ the type of men on border patrols who have knowledge of international law and delicacy in dealing with killers, and when, perchance, they execute their duty an inch over the line, they are the cause of an international incident. The sensational press envisages Avar with the British Empire whenever an American patrol boat fires on a Canadian bootlegger, or vice versa, and if, perchance, one of this criminal class should be killed or captured, he becomes an international celebrity. The diplomatic officers of Great Britain are placed in the difficult position of defending the rights of criminals. All this leads to constant and disagreeable irritation. The Canadian officials in contact Avith our officials in the past have insisted very frankly that the export of alcoholic beverages is an important item in Canadian trade. We realise there is no obligation upon Canada to trouble herself over our problems. We bear her no ill-Avill in the matter, for she is entirely Avithin her rights in leaving it alone. The benefits to Canada by full co-operation with the United States to help in a social question would lie in better feeling in the United States, which would, I am sure, interpret itself in time into co-operation in other directions Avhich would be of assistance to her.There is no real solution to the problem unless the Canadian Government AArould undertake to prohibit shipment of all liquor to the United States. At the present time the great bulk of shipments (as per my official information, 90 per cent.) are cleared directly for American ports. If the only shipments Avere upon false papers the traffic would greatly diminish, as the smuggler Avould thus be in conflict and in danger from, the laws of both countries.Mr. Mackenzie King has recently taken an interest in the matter and expressed a desire to clear it up. The British Government also controls a certain amount of liquor flow into the United States through the West Indies, and some direct from British ports.  The question, therefore, involves Great Britain directly also.o-
