Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1929.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.     30CP. 371 (29).(Also C.R. (H.) 75.)COMMITTEE OF CIVIL RESEARCH.Sub-Committee on the Fishing Industry.DISCOVERY OF NEW FISHING GROUNDS.Interim Report.I.  Intboductoky .1. On the 25th October, 1929, the Prime Minister appointed a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research with the follow-ing terms of reference : To inquire into and report upon the condition and prospect of the fishing industry, including the supply, marketing and distribution of fish, and to make recommendations as to any measures which appear to be desirable and practicable for the improvement of the condition of the industry and of those engaged therein.2.   The Sub-Committee was composed as follows : The Eight Hon C. Addison, M.D., M.P., Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Chairman).Mr. Charles Duncan, M.P.Captain Basil Hall, R.N.Mr. Robert M. Holland-Martin, C.B.Mr. Robert Murray.Sir Felix J. C. Pole.Professor W. R. Scott.Mr. A. F. Hemming, C.B.E., Assistant Secretary, Committee of Civil Research.Mr. Wynn Thomas, Ministry of Agri-culture and Fisheries3. At an early stage of our investigations the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries invited us, as a matter of urgency, to consider proposals that had been submitted to the Ministry and to the Admi-ralty by The British Trawlers&apos; Federation, for further exploratory voyages for the discovery of new fishing grounds. We have taken oral evidence on this question from representatives of The British Trawlers&apos; Federation, from the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and also from the Hydro-grapher of the Navy. The matter is urgent, as, if any action is to be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the financial year 1930-81, it is desirable that the necessary financial provision should be made in the estimates which are now before the Treasury. We therefore submit the following Interim Report for the consideration of the Committee of Civil Research.I    Joint f Secretaries.[20807]E
II. The Proposals of The British Trawlers&apos; Federation.4. Arrangements were made this year for the employment from Maj&apos; to September of H.M.S. &quot; Rosemary &quot; in the examination of a large area between Iceland and the Farce Islands and a further and larger area extending in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction from Rockall and westwards for an average distance of approximately 180 miles. These areas have been systematically sounded and temperatures and salinities obtained at selected posi-tions. This work was undertaken at the cost of public funds with a view to supplying the trawling industry with information likely to be of assistance to them in the discovery of new fishing grounds in these regions. In this connection we would observe that the tendency of recent years has been for trawling operations to be con-ducted on more and more distant grounds. In some cases the nearer fishing grounds formerly worked by British trawlers have become less productive, in others foreign competition has become keener. Difficulties in recent years raised in regard to fishing on the Murman coast has also led British trawlers to explore more northerly portions of the Barents Sea. In general, it is true to say that the possibility of working any given fishing ground is only limited by the length of the necessary voyage, as on this depends the marketing in good condition of the fish caught.5. High testimony is paid by The British Trawlers&apos; Federation to the work of H.M.S. &quot;Rosemary,&quot; and they urge strongly that exploratory work for the discovery of further new fishing grounds should be undertaken. They recommend that a general survey should be carried out between the latitude of 60 degrees north and 75 degrees north, and between longitude 45 degrees west and 55 degrees east. This constitutes a belt approximately 250 miles wide, stretching from the East Coast of Greenland to the West Coast of Nova Zemlya. The Federation realise that a survey of so large a sea area could only be carried out over a long period of years. They recommend, therefore, that the survey should be conducted in sections, and that the first area on which work should be done is the Continental shelf on the north-east of Iceland, which is within the capacity of H.M.S. &quot; Rosemary.&quot; The next area to which they attach importance is that immediately surrounding Bear Island (which is almost due south of Spitsbergen), and thence eastward and south-eastward to Nova Zemlya. Other areas in regard to which they are anxious to obtain information are the grounds around Jan Mayen Island and the waters within the 150-fathom limit on the east coast of Greenland.6. The Federation have informed us that there is a large and increasing demand in industrial areas, such as Lancashire and the West Riding, for fish of the commoner types, such as have been taken in abundance on the Bear Island grounds. Indeed, we under -stand that this year, if it had not been for the landings from those grounds, there would have been an actual shortage of this class of fish. The Federation represent that, for their purposes, existing charts of these regions are inadequate and that foreign Governments have contributed more largely than has that of this country to what little is known of these waters. In existing circumstances it is necessary to incur substantial expenditure in time and money even to locate fishing grounds previously visited. In addition, they claim that there are none of the normal aids to navigation in these waters. In short, owing to the absence of adequate data,, the use of these grounds for fishing is more costly and more dangerous than in the waters in which, for economic reasons, it is less profitable for British trawlers to operate. Large sums of capital have been sunk by the industry in the provision of the equipment necessary to exploit these new grounds. The industry, however, is, it is claimed, not in a position to undertake the desired survey work. Further, they contend that it would be unreasonable to expect them to incur an expenditure, the results of which would be embodied in published charts and thus become available to the whole world. The areas in which they formerly found their fish were adequately charted by the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty, and they urge that similar survey work should be
undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the waters in which they now find it necessary to work. The survey would, in their view, be enhanced if it could be accompanied by practical tests on a small scale of the fishing capacity of the grounds explored; and they suggest that for this purpose the ship should carry the requisite fishing gear and should include in her complement a fishing skipper of experience.III. Eecommbndations.7. We feel that there is great weight in the arguments that have been adduced by The British Trawlers&apos; Federation. Mining industry depends largely upon geological surveys, the conduct of which in almost every country is regarded as the duty of the State. We think that there is force in their argument that the cost of the hydrographic surveys required for the provision of adequate charts should also be regarded as a proper charge on public funds. Expenditure thereon constitutes, in fact, a piece of national research of great value to the trawling industry as a whole.8. We are informed by The British Trawlers&apos; Federation that there are this year approximately one hundred trawlers engaged in working the Bear Island and Barents Sea grounds. There have, we understand, been some ninety landings this year from Bear Island alone, and the Federation anticipate that this number will be increased three-fold in 1930. If adequate charts were available showing the site of the fishing grounds, the Federation consider that there is almost no limit to the number of landings which would be possible if the necessary trawlers were available. Equally, they are confident that the unexhausted demand for fish is very large. Given the hydrographic data they require, they believe that present landings could immediately be multiplied four-fold. If this anticipation proved approximately correct, large numbers of additional trawlers would be required, and a substantial increase would take place in the numbers of fishermen employed in the trawling section of the industry. It is estimated that each trawler in a port gives permanent employment afloat and ashore to at least thirty men. A hundred additional trawlers might therefore be expected to find additional employment for 3,000 men in the fishing industry.9. The British Trawlers&apos; Federation suggested that two vessels should be employed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the survey work which they recommended should be carried out under the direction of the Hydrographer of the Navy. We accept the contention of the Federation that it is in the national interests for such a survey to he undertaken, and we recommend that an immediate start on ii should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. It could not, however, be undertaken by the Admiralty as part of their normal surveying work as the resources at their disposal are adequate only for the carrying out in other directions of work which is necessary for the purposes of general navigation. We do not, however, think that in the present state of knowledge the employment of two survey ships would be justified. We are confirmed in this view by the fact that, according to our informa-tion, no suitable ships are in existence, and that, if the work is to be done, vessels will have to be specially constructed. For this work it is necessary, in the first place, to have a vessel capable of standing ice pressure. Further, survey work of this type requires a ship with a sea endurance of as much as 10,000 miles; in other words, a ship capable of remaining at sea for a period of say two months. We are advised that probably the most suitable type of vessel would be one designed on substantially the same lines as the Antarctic research ship, &quot;Discovery II.&quot; We are informed that the cost of constructing such a vessel would amount probably to about  70,000, and that the cost of the necessary scientific equipment would be  10,000, making a total of  80,000 in all. We understand that it should be possible to construct and equip a vessel of this type in a period of ten months. It is difficult to estimate with precision the probable running costs of such a [20807] b 2
vessel. We understand, however, that these charges amount, in the case of the smaller home service survey ships, to approximately  28,000 per annum. For a larger vessel of the type we have in mind, we do not think it would be safe to estimate a smaller expenditure than  34,000 per annum.10. We have discussed with the British Trawlers&apos; Federation and with the Hydrographer of the Navy the question of the length of time which would be occupied by a survey of the area indicated in paragraph 5 above. The figures put forward by the Federation were admittedly tentative. They suggested that the region round Bear Island and eastwards to Nova Zemlya might perhaps be surveyed in eighteen working months. We understand from the Hydrographer that, owing to the high latitude of this area, it would probably not be possible to do surveying work for more than six months annually. The remaining six months in each year would be occupied in working up the data collected, which would be published as and when it became available. On this basis, this part of the survey would occupy three years. We understand, however, from the Hydrographer that, in his opinion, this is too low an estimate. On the whole, we consider that if, on our recommendation, a special survey ship is built, a minimum programme of five years&apos; work should be envisaged. The estimated life of a vessel of the type that we recommend is twenty years. On the conclusion of the preliminary period recommended it would therefore be available for many years to continue the fishery survey if the hopes we entertain of its value to the trawling industry are realised. If not, it could be used for the normal hydrographic work of the Admiralty. The addition of this vessel to the list of survey ships under the control of the Hydrographer would, in that case, mean an ultimate saving to Navy Votes. If we are right in assuming that the running cost will amount to  34,000 per annum, the total charge over the five-year period on this account would be  170,000. To this must be added the estimated cost,  80,000, of the vessel. The total expenditure under our scheme is therefore  250,000; of this,  80,000 (the cost of construction) would fall to be paid in the first year, and  34,000 per annum in each of the next five years.IV. Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.11. For the convenience of the Committee of Civil Research, we summarise our conclusions as follows : (a.) In recent years the trawling industry has been faced with the necessity of going farther and farther afield for fishing grounds, the nearer grounds which they formerly trawled having either deteriorated in value or become less profitable owing to keener foreign competition.(b.) The new fishing grounds referred to in conclusion (a) above are situated between the latitude of 60 degrees north and 75 degrees north, and between longitude 45 degrees west and 55 degrees east. Within this sector, the most important unsurveyed areas are the Continental shelf on the north-east of Iceland, the area immediately surrounding Bear Island, and thence eastward and south-eastward to Nova Zemlya.(c.) The successful trawling in the past of the nearer fishing grounds was facilitated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who carried out adequate hydrographic surveys of these waters. The charts based on these surveys were of great value to the British trawling industry in the location of fishing grounds.(d.) In the more distant fishing grounds where, for the reasons explained in (a) above, British trawlers have now to operate, no adequate hydrographic survey has been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government. To some extent, it is even the case that foreign Governments have contri-buted more largely than has that of this country to what little is known regarding these waters.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, December 19, 1929.(e.) In the absence of adequate charts, the British trawling industry is materially handicapped in locating for fishing grounds in these more distant areas. In addition, the usual aids to navigation are not available. This causes an added risk of loss of life and material.(/.) There is reason to believe that, if a survey was available, an almost unlimited quantity of fish could be obtained from these grounds. The fish obtained from them are mostly of the commoner type, for which there is a large demand in this country, especially in industrial areas. Without the landings obtained from the neighbourhood of Bear Island, there would this year have been an actual shortage of this type of fish. If further supplies were available, and if as a result prices could be lowered, it is probable that the consumption of this class of fish could be very largely increased in this country.(g.) We think that for the reasons explained in conclusions (c) and (/) above, it is reasonable that the fishing industry should look to His Majesty&apos;s Government to provide, in respect of the new fishing grounds, the same type of information as they formerly supplied in regard to the nearer fishing grounds. We think, further, that on national grounds this expenditure would be amply justified by the stimulus it would offer to the marketing of a larger supply of fish for consumption in this country.12. We summarise as follows the recommendations we desire to submit in the light of the foregoing conclusions : (a.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should order forthwith the construction of a survey vessel on the lines of the &quot;Discovery II&quot; at an estimated capital cost, including scientific equipment, of , 80,000.(b.) That, in announcing this decision, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should state that, on the completion of this vessel, they propose to ask Parliament to provide annually the sum of  34,000 to cover the cost of running expenses in each of the next succeeding five years.(c.) That the vessel should be constructed and equipped by the Admiralty, and that when constructed it should operate under the control and direction of the Hydrographer of the Navy.(d.) That the expenditure involved should be regarded as a contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the welfare of the fishing industry, and that appropriate arrangements should be made to reimburse Navy Votes in respect of the expenditure incurred.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,CHRISTOPHER ADDISON, Chairman
