MA370(29)COPY NO.CABINET.TRADE OUTLOOK.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the information of the Cabinet the minutes of the December meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council dealing with the state of trade In November.The general position is on the whole fairly satisfactory with certain marked but limited exceptions; the monetary position has distinctly improved.Domestic trade increased according to Co-operative and other reports but the departmental store trade was not so good.   Railway receipts were up, especially for coal and other goods benefitting by the recent reductions in rates.The coal industry showed further improvement especially in exports (where we seem to be recovering ground lost In Scandinavia to Germany and Poland) and the output for the first three weeks in November was high.    Forward business was however, affected by uncertainty.In Iron and steel, production fell generally in the United States of America and on the Continent, but there was no material change in this country where quiet conditions continue.In engineering there was some improvement attributable at least in part to Government unemployment schemes and expenditure by railways on account of the remission of rates.In shipbuilding there /fas little change but a fair number of new orders were received in faoe of keen foreign competition.Textile exports had to face new tariff difficulties in-1-
Canada (preference regulations), In Australia (hosiery, woollens and cottons) and Turkey (cottons) which are occasioning loss of trade; also Japanese competition.The motor industry has an apprehensive eye on next year&apos;s budget and has seen the first signs of dumping in unofficial cutting of prices, but current production is maintained, especially in goods vehicles.The number of unemployed increased during November by 65,000 largely owing to seasonal causes; on the other hand the number of employed insured persons was 246,000 more than a year ago.W. G.Board of Trade,December, 1929.

Annex,
MR. WAR HAM reported that the output of coal in the United Kingdom for the weeks ended November 9th, 16th and 23rd was 5,265,000, 5,239,000 and 5,582 ,,000 teas respectively.    The average of the eight, weeks ended November 23rd was 5,199.000 tons, as compared with 4,779,-000 tons for the corresponding period last year - a very substantial increase - (the weekly average in 1913 was 5,526,000 tons).   Unemployment for the month of October was 15.5 per cent as compared with the revised figure of 15.1 per cent in September and 21.9 per cent average for 1928.The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom (excluding the Irish Free State) during October showed a marked improvement as compared with September, both as regards quantity and average price,,    The figures were, for October 5 ,.514,731 tons at an average price per ton f.o.b. of 16s.5d, and for September 4,973,630 tons at 16s.    Exports from Germany for the same period fell by 465,000 tons to  2,180,000 tons.    The exports by sea from Poland during October showed an increase over Sept-ember -742,000 tons for October as against 721,000 tons for September.It was reported that the commercial treaty between Germany and Poland had now been signed and that the embargo on Polish coal into Germany would be raised very shortly,*   This meant that Poland would be allowed to send from 300,000 to 350,000 tons per month into Germany, which might cause a considerable difference to her exports from Dansig and Gdynia.The general tendency regarding the industry In this country was a steady improvement In prices.    The improvement in inland trade was largely the effect of the winter demand for household coal, although that had not developed to any great extent yot.   There was also a considerable increase In the supply of coal to public utility undertakings.   The demand for graded fuel was increasing much faster than for large coal. This applied generally, but particularly In South Wales, where large coal used to be taken for high-class bunkers a trade which had been lost to oil.Tonnage was muoh more normal, and shipments were being effected without serious trouble.    The reported settlement of the Australian coal  strike had caused a cessation of enquiry from that country, which, however, was once more being resumed. Although forward business was still being held up by the uncertainty of the future position, prospects were quite favourable for the next few months.*This report has not been confirmed.-1-The Chairman announced that Mr, Elliot had been appointed to succeed the late Mr.  Maunder as Secretary of the. Advisory C ounci 1,NEXT MEETING.The next meeting of the Council will be held on the 12th February.COAL.
COAL (CONTD J .MR. MITCHELL reported an improvement in demand in the coal trade in Scotland, where there had been regular work.    Shipments however, had been poor, though there was a slight improvement In prices.    It was impossible to know how far the Improvement was due to the fear of trouble in the industry leading to stoppages. Stocks had been Increasing in some parts of the Continent, and the slackness in trade in Germany was bringing about reduced consumption of coal.   Forward business could not be negotiated &apos; at present prices.IRON AND STEEL.MR. BOND wrote:&quot;&quot;The quieter conditions which commenced in October continued during November, although production has been main-tained at a fairly high level on past orders.    Production will not, however, reach the level obtained in October,   Dull market conditions are common to all the principal steel producing countries at the moment.    Production has fallen off considerably in the United States, where it is considered to be a natural reaction from the record production of the previous months rather than a result of the financial crisis.    Production is still being curtailed on the Continent.    It will be remembered in the last monthly report it was stated that the International Cartel had decided to reduce quotas as from November 1st by 10 per cent.   A meeting of the Cartel was held on December 3rd, when it was decided to restrict the quota for December by 10 per cent: but whereas the 10 per cent reduction in November was based on the October quota, the 10 per cent, reduction for the current month, it is reported, is to be based on the October output, which was higher than the quota: on this basis  the reduction for the current month will be greater than that for November.    The report that has appeared in the English press that a further 10 per1 cent, reduction Is to be made at the end of this month is not confirmed and should be treated with reserve.&quot;On the North East Coast production and prices of Cleveland pig Iron are maintained, but new orders are somewhat scarce: not only has export trade fallen off but Continental pig iron is proving a competitor with Cleveland iron In Scotland and the Midlands with the result that the tone of the -market Is by no means satisfactory.    Steel production for November on the North East Coast is approximately the same as for October, but prospects for December and the next three months are somewhat dull.   Although further orders for ships have been placed and certain orders have been given out for steel there is an appreciable falling off in specifications. Prices of raw materials show an upward tendency, with the exception of scrap, which is somewhat easier.   Foreign competition Is again being experienced, but so far home makers have not reduced their prices.    Forward buying has. practically ceased and the general prospects for the next few months leave room for improvement v&quot;In the Midlands the position is rather less satisfactory than on the North East Coast and order books show a decline.
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.),Production for November is likely to be less than in the previous month.   New business is coming in slowly.   Conditions in South Wales show no substantial change, the volume of new business placed being satisfactory.&quot;in Scotland production shows a falling off compared with last month, and in some cases mills have had to go on a shorter working week owing to the lack of orders.    Orders are at present only coming In from day to day, although at this period of the year firms are generally endeavouring to get a s much material In as possible in order to carry over the New Year stoppage in the steel works without hindrance.    In contrast to the position on the North East Coast there is a slight increase of activity in the export tra.de and good orders have recently been placed, but the home trade continues unsatisfactory,.   The export orders have been for the most part for rails, although enquiries have been received for a more general character which, it is hoped, may result in business in some cases.   As on the North East Coast scrap prices are somewhat easier. Foreign competition outside the home market continues to be keen and it is only with difficulty that plates and sections can be sold to near Continental countries.    Prices of foreign &apos; imported material are again very much reduced, but the Rebate Scheme appears to still suffice to retain such shipbuilding orders as are available for this country.Generally speaking there has been no material change in the iron and steel position.   Competition for available orders continues keen and the volume of new business is below that usual at this period.    It would appear that quiet conditions are likely to continue.&quot;MR. MITCHELL said that the steel trade in Scotland was unsatisfactory and a good deal of time was being lost at the mills.   The trade was distinctly worse than it had been during the previoiB months of the year.    Scrap was more plentiful and the price was easier.   The pig-iron trade was patchyj    there had been somo advances in price, and the demand was not improving.   Continental pig-iron was being offered and some had been Imported.    More Indian pig-iron had been purchased and more was on offer considerably under home prices.    It was alarming to see that Belgium now e:xported more iron and steel than Great Britain,    Imports of steel continued large and at very low prices j    there was, however, an attempt on the Continent to restrict output and increase prices.In Scotland, constructional engineers complained of the lack of orders.   The tube trade was dull, and time had been lost at a good many works.    The same position existed on the Continent and there was an undoubted set-back in business.NON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTELTON reported that consumption of copper had been maintained at a fairly satisfactory rate over the year ard
NON-FERROUS METALS (C ONTD.).it was hoped that the electrical development a which were in hand would cause an increase in its use.   The policy pursued by the American producers of maintaining the price at a relatively high level had, however, done something to check the demand.   The tinplato industry was well maintained,,   The position of spelter was unsafis factory and the demand was low, though the consumption of spelter over the year showed a slight Increase over last year.   The low price had caused one of the English spelter manufacturers to close down his plant in the Swansea district.   The demand for lead had been fairly satis-factory, and the cable makers still appeared to be active.ENGINEERING.MR. RICHMOND sent the following reportMarine engineering in November shows little variation from the position during the last few months.    Employment figures show a slight decline in October, and overall the percentage is still high at 10.1.   Notwithstanding this there is reported in the Clyde district considerable difficulty in obtaining fitters and turners up to standard requirements in skill, and many men have left the trade to seek employment in sheltered occupations such as the Municipal tramcar service, etc    It would appear as if many of those now returned as unemployed are of an Inferior grade as regards skill or of the unemployable class.Oil Tanker   orders continue to be placed, and of the 7 vessels for The Standard Company (U, S. A.) Great Britain has obtained 2, Germany 3, and Italy and Denmark 1 each.   Competition ih this work is very keen and prices low, but the N.E.  Coast appears to be able to hold Its own, and to attract Scandinavian orders particularly.   The propelling machinery for Tankers is uhiefly of the oil-engine type, the steam propelled Tankers under construction being a comparatively small proportion, about l/lOth of the whole.    Messrs. Sulzer of Winterthur have published their latest returns of marine engines built to their designs, ard  in Great Britain there are under construction 30 vessels having a total of 132,000&quot; H.P. which Is a partial indication of the tribute marine engineering has to pay in license fees to foreign designers.On the Clyde although the output for October has been the lowest of the year In respect of tonnage, there has been a fair number of new contracts placed, and it is encouraging that three sets of machinery have been booked for vessels building in -   other areas.    On the North East Coast also a fair number of new orders have been placed, but It is evident the facilities for production are far in advance of the demands as the unemployment figure still stands at 12,2$, but as the work just placed advances in construction, there would appear to be a. probability of this figure improving and the outlook being brighter for the winter months.    On the Mersey there is little improvement in respect of ,new work and complaints of unremunerative prices for that obtained.
A 91ENGINEERING (CONTD. ) .The activity in Germany, Prance and Italy in the development of passenger liners for the Atlantic trade -l^ads to the hope that at no distant date the long-expected vessels for the Gunard Gompany may be laid down, with excellent effect both on the shipping prestige of the country and on the unemployment situation in the industry.General engineering in Scotland tends to improve -motor vehicle builders are well employed, and recent railway orders have improved the position both for locomotive builders and rolling stock makers.    Structural engineering is fair and tool makers continue well employed.MOTOR  INDUSTRY.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS said that although the existing . factory position had not changed in the past month in connection -tion with the British Motor industry, there was   undoubtedly a general slackening off of advance enquiries, possibly attributable to the weather.In the Coventry area, unemployment figures show a further reduction compared with October.   The position there is certainly, at the moment, better than during the same period of 1928.Commercial vehicle factories appear to have sufficient orders both for goods and passenger vehicles to maintain plants at full production for some time to come.The position in regard to imports is leading to increased discounts to agents - this is the beginning of the signs of dumping from the other side;    that is to say, they are getting rid of their stuff over here by giving big discounts and this is resulting in certain unofficial cutting in prices.   Cars are got rid of at a dumping by allowing colossal prices for second-hand cars.Broadly, there is a general feeling of uncertainty as to the future, which has grown more intense from week to week during the past month.    Sir William Morris said that his own factories are very busy, both on the commercial side and on the pleasure side.    Speaking generally, the position is, if anything, better than last year.sir CYRIL HURCOMB sent the following statement:-&quot;The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles) registered for the first time in September 19 29, was 1,881 more than in the corresponding period in 1928,    The bulk of this Increase (],29 3)   is due to goods vehicles.&quot;There was an increase of 335 motor cycles compared with September 1928,&quot;
COTTON.MR. H.B, LEE said that trade was becoming distinctly worse.    Employment was loss and prospects poorer.   There was still no settlement of the question of the Canadian regula-tions governing the grant of preferential duties on cotton goods.    Difficulty was also being caused by the revision of the Australian tariff, by the wool dispute, which affected a good many of the finer yarns for mixed cloth, by the fall in the value of cotton,, and by the uncertainty in the matter of the silk duties,  which affected the mixtures of silk and artificial silk and cotton.   The last mentioned factor was practically stopping the trade for the time being in the sections concerned.SIR KENNETH STEWART wrote&quot;Orders from the East have been on a poor level during the last month.    So far as I can judge competition from Japan has been the principal cause.    Dealers have been frightened to order our goods for forward delivery In case they find Japanese goods on the market at lower prices.    On the whole business to most other markets has been fairly normal, but the continual pressure we are feeling from foreign competition is making steady inroads into the turnover of  cotton goods,&quot;MR. LENNOX LEE handed in the following report^t:-During the first fortnight of November cotton values continued to decline, but had a sharp rise during the third week and;, while prices were a dvancing, trade improved slightly. The Bureau report on the condition of the American crop, the probable yield and the amount ginned, had little effect on prices.    There i s no doubt that the final crop will be some-where in the region of 14,900,000 to 15,000,000 bales.Business for India, for   short spell coinciding with the upward movement of cotton, was fairly brisk.    China is still very disappointing, owing to the low exchange value of the Tael and the unsettled state of the country.    Trade with Constantinople is practically at a  standstill owing to the uncertainty existing regarding new duties,  and  stocks of all kinds of cotton goods are reported to be very large.   Trade with the Dutch East Indies and South America   has on the whole been dull.    During the month it has been rumoured that a 50$ reduction of the import duty is to be made on artificial silk and artificial silk and cotton mixtures imported into the Argentine.    South Africa has been in the market for heavy goods as has also Australia,    The latter&apos;s action in rising her tariff barrier is regarded as a serious blow to the cotton trade.In the bleaching section of the trade receipts and deliveries of cloth have continued to improve, but they have not yet reached the pz-e-stoppage level and they are lower than during the corresponding period last year.    Single fold poplins and split brocades have formed steady features of an otherwise fluctuating trade in the dyeing industry. Silesians and warp sateens have been maintained, but there has been
fi -f $COTTOE  (OONTD.).a falling off in casements and other light cloths whilst the decline in artificial silks has continued.   The improved standard of activity in the printing section of the industry noted at the end of October was fairly well maintained during November, but there are still no marked signs of real recovery. Orders come in very spasmodically, to meet actual requirements.WOOL.MR. HAMILTON said that the two notable events in connec-tion   with the woollen and worsted trade have been, firstly, the International Wool Conference which has held in Bradford in November.    Ten European textile nations were represented. The number is increasing steadily, and the basis of membership is agreement to arbitrate in all trade disputes.    Throughout that international meeting very good feeling with our foreign competitors prevailed.Secondly, the sudden and quite unexpected increase    in the Australian tariff, which varies between 50 to 100 per cent, ad valorem on heavy goods.    In addition to the ad valorem duty there is also a specific duty on the same article, and both these duties have increased.One novel and unpleasant feature is the abolition of pre-ference in the case of yarn.    The duty on worsted yarn, previously 20 per cent, has been increased to 35 per cent.   . plus Is. per lb which i s t he same rate of duty as charged on continental and other yarns, and, of course, will put a complete stop to the yarn trade.   Cancellations have been coming in wholesale.    In any case, the preference is becoming meaningless, and the feeling has been expressed that whether we drown in 6 ft. of water or 60 ft. is very much the same. Mr. Hamilton added that the manufacturers here rather resent having to pay for the encouragement of exports of Australian produce to this country, whilst Australia is denying fair treatment to their exports to that  country.- With regard to the state of trade in general, it is perhaps rather below normal.    Asked by the Chairman what effect the increase in tariff would have on the trade in Huddersfield,    Mr. Hamilton replied that he thought it was hurting the whole trade but he added that the trade had been pretty well killed already so far as Australia is concerned.MR. ARTHUR SHAW said that in his judgment the position of the wool textile industry in the West Riding of Yorkshire was very serious, all efforts to settle the wages dispute having failod.Approximately 90 per cent, of the workpeople were still boing paid the rates of wages operating under the old agree-ment.    The wages of 20,000 operatives had been reduced by percentages varying from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.   During the week-end wages reduction notices had been posted up at nine federated firms in the Saddleworth area, and the Unions had decided to advise the operatives to cease work.    The
WOOL (CONTD. )uncertainty of the labour position., and the variation in wool values make It almost impossible for any trade to be transacted on a normal basis, and the outlook is gloomy.In the Bradford weekly wool chart the wool index figures stood at wool, 103 as against 99 for October; tops, 113 as against 110.    The yarns are the same - 131, the group average being 116 as against 113,    The October price of wool was aotually below the level for July 1914.Unemployment fluctuates considerably in the various sections of the trade, and in the heavy woollen district the recovery made between May and September has not been     .1 maintained.    In the five weeks ending October 30, an average of 17 per cent, of the membership of the Union was signing the vacant book, and for the four weeks ending November 27, that percentage had increased to nearly 22.    There appears to be very little hope of an improvement in the industry before the end of the year.On the other hand, there has been a steady improvement in the Huddersfield trade, unemployment in that district having decreased from 12^- per cent. - the average for October - to just under 11 per cent, for November, the improvement in the fine cloth section being more apparent than in the heavier woollen section.    The Bradford trade has also shown a very marked improvement, the average unemployment for November being 15 per cent, as against 19 per cent, for October, according to Union figures.    The unemployment is reflected very clearly in the official trade returns of the Board cf Trade, which show that the exports of woollen and worsted tissues for the ten months ending October 1929 have decreased by over 12 million square yards as compared with those for the same period in the previous year.Practically the whole of the decrease in exports can be attributed to three countries - China, Japan and Australia, whose combined imports have decreased by over 12 million square yards.    In 1924 those three countries took 83 million square yards, or 38 per cent, of the total of 221 million square yards of piece goods exported.    Since 1924 there has been a rapid decrease in the proportion exported to those countries, and out of the total of 170 millions in 1928, the combined exports to China, Japan and Australia fell to 41 millions, or one-half of the 1924 figure, that is, only 24 per cent, of the total exports as against 38 per cent, in 19 24.The figures available up to date are still more depressing.   Whilst for the ten months ending October, 1928, the exports to the three countries concerned were 34 million square yards, the exports  for the corroaponding period this year have fallen to 21.8 millions, which represents just over 16 per cent, of the total exports only.Mr.  Shaw had very little hope of the export trade of these countries ever being restored to the 1924 position, and felt convinced that for the 12 months ending December 1929 the decrease in the exports to the three oountries named will be not less than 55 million square yards, as compared with 1924.
WOOL (CONTD. )It is generally accepted in the trade that at least 500 textile operatives are fully employed for a period of 12 months in the production of one million square yards of cloth.    On this basis it will be seen that nearly 30,000 workers have been totally displaced, or a far greater number will have been working short time, as a result of the loss of trade to these three particular countries.The average price of the exported tissues for the current year is over  206,000 per million square yards, or the loss in trading to these three countries represents, in values, nearly  12,000,000, and in wages to tho operatives,  4,000,000.A table of the total exports of woollen and worsted tissues for the year 1924 up to the present time, is appended.    It was vital at this juncture in the Speaker&apos;s opinion that some attention should be paid to the position of the wool textile trade.    There was not the home trade to-day that there was some time ago, the decrease in purchasing power being general.TABLE OF EXPORTS.WOOLLEN AND WORSTED TISSUES.

&apos;i- (j oHOSIERY.MR. E. T. WALKER&apos;S report dealt with, hosiery.    In regard to Leioester, the improvement noted laBt month has been maintained as far as the home trade is concerned.There was no improvement in export trade, however, and many cancellations had been received owing to the recent heavy increases in the Australian tariffs.    The effect of these inoreasos will be a serious loss of trade to the hosiery manu-faoturers of &quot;this country, and a great deal of resentment has been caused by* the arbitrary action of the Australian Customs Authorities, resulting in spirited protests being put forward by the Chamber of Commerce- and Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Aasooia-tion.   The latter body has instructed its members not to accep^t cancellations, and is prepared to support its members in adopting a firm attitude on this point.In regard to Nottingham, the underwear trade is about normal for the time of the year.    Cold sharp weather would givo a stimulus to this section, but it is required immediately because experienoo shows that after Christmas few repeat orders are received, the public preferring to defer making purchases until the Spring.The outerwear trade is quito busy with a keen demand for smart novelty goods.The export trade is moving on normal lines, except as regards Australia.    New Zealand is -operating perhaps a little more freely than other Colonial markets.Mr. Walker said that the new Australian Government had apparently decided to stop entirely the importation of hosiery, -whether of British or foreign manufacture.     The duties wero already such as to afford ample protection to any moderately efficient domestic manufacturer, but without any notice whatsoever they were increased on the 22nd November to an extent which will make the landed prices of British goods, except  &apos; possibly those of the highest and most exclusive class, absolutely prohibitive.    The duties imposed on underwear in September,  1925, had reduoed the imports of British goods from considerable to very small proportions, and the new rates would complete the operation.The new duties on stockings and socks are in keeping with those imposed on underwear, and the duty on cotton hose suoh as have &quot;been bought extensively in Australia, works out at 300 per cent.   As a sequel to the imposition of these duties last Friday a cablegram was received on Monday morning by the President of tho Nottinghmm Chamber of Commerce, from the Preaident of the South Australian Chamber of Manufacturers, stating that they would welcome the establishment in South Australia of Hosiery Mills by Nottingham Manufacturers, and intimating that the present Government promised sympathetic treatment.    Mr.Walker said that that is not likely to happen;    there are already too many hosiery manufacturers in Australia at the present time. Ono big Nottingham firm went there a year ago, but had decided to close down.
HOSIERY (OONTPj .In Hinckley the condition of things is bad generally,     The Trades Union representatives of the different branches all confirm this state of affairs.    Unemployment in this district, and short time, aro universal.    The Australian tariffs have stopped the Australian trade entirely.There is a very serious state of affairs in regard to the production of foreign hosiery being brought into this country in a partly completed state.    The goods are manufactured abroad and are imported into this country in the cheapest way, namely, in bags, for completion as to dyeing and countering.    While it is certain that this might help the dyeing and countering portions of the trade, it iB going to have a most serious effect on production, and will have to be dealt with in the near future.Mr. Walker&apos;s Information was that a certain quantity of these goods come in under the heading of &quot;Tissue&quot;.    If so, they would pay a lower duty than the manufactured article      He did not know whether the Customs dealt with this subject in the same way at every port of importation, but the matter should be taken  up.    It is also stated that these goods come in with a British trade-mark put on them, and he was having this investigated.As regards Loughborough,  there was a slight improvement all the way round during November - trade for all sections being somewhat better.CHEMICALS.MR. 0. A. HILL,  speaking for the chemical industry,  said that there had been no spocial developments or occurrences of importance during the past month.There had been a steady improvement in regard to heavy chemicals despite adverse circumstances such as the unrest in the cotton and wool trade, the continued depression in the steel trade, and a temporary set-back in the artificial silk trade, all of which are customers of heavy chemicals.With regard to prices there has been a steady decline for some years past, but this cannot be expected to continue owing to the cost of fuel and raw materials advanoing.      In fact, the price of some chemicals have already started to rise.In the fine chemical industry trade has continued its upward trend.     The present year may be describod as one of development and consolidation of processes already established, with a tendency for price levels to fall.     Home trade has been affected adversely by increasing imports which come into the country at values which are lower than those ruling throughout the world, and against which even the Key Industry Duty of 33.  /g per cent.
CHEMICALS.   (OOiTTD % )has proved inadequato.     Many oases of these low declared values have been brought to   the notice of the Customs by the Association of British Chemical Manufacturers.In the case of pharmaceutical preparations, exports show an increase of about 10 por cent over 1923,      The position in regard to imports for the reasons indicated is muoh less satisfactory.GAS INDUSTRY.SIR DAVID MILNE - V/ATSON observed that the market for ooke was good at the present time and should be of assistance to gas under-takings and ooke ovens.      Sulphate of ammonia had been further reduced In price to  7 per ton as against  12 pre-war, which was of considerable help to agriculture. Demand was increasing in Spain, India, Australia and other places, but, owing to the large and increasing production of synthetic nitrogen, stocks wore still tending to increase.      In regard to pitch the position was rather better and the market was, on the whole, satisfactory.      The pitch was mostly exported to France for briquette-making purposes. The large oil companies had bought considerable quantities of oreosoto for fuel purposes.     Amcrioa had, as the Council knew, imposed a limit on the amount of creosote they would import, which this year was about 30 million gallons.      That trade was being competed for by both the Germans and ourselves.      The Admiralty had made an enquiry for creosote for fuel purposes, but he did not know whether it would result in any orders.With, regard to tar, enquiries -sere just beginning to come in for road dressing purposes next year.     The great competitor in that market was bitumen from the oil companies.     An important factor in the low-temperature carbonisation process was that the tars from low-temperature plants wore very difficult to dispose of, as they were not suitable for road dressing.     They were suitable for hydrogenation and conversion into spirit, but so far he did not think any country, even Germany, had made a commercial sucoess of it.THE MOKEY MARKET.LORD BRADBURY dealt with the money market in November 1929. He stated that the .iall Street collapse was a definite turning point in monetary affairs and that international finance had since been engaged in accommodating itself to the consoquences of that event.     There was no longer any use in the New York short loan market for the enormous quantities of foreign money that had accumulated there. This money had beenrapidly finding its way back to Europe by way of London, and a great deal of it has naturally been invested in the sterling bill of oxchange.One result of this is a firm sterling-dollar exchange; another, a rapid fall in the short money rate here carrying with it a reduction in bank rate from 6 per cent to 5-^ per
THE MONEY MARKET.   (OOIITD . ;cent on 21st November.      This reduction took place in spite of tho fact that there was no improvement in the Bank of England&apos;s gold position at that date. The French exchange was stillweak at a level which permitted persistent exports of gold to France.       On the other hand, the New York exchange appeared to be approaching a figure at which gold imports from America to- London or Paris were to be expected, and in any oase the bill rate here had fallen altogether out of touch with a higher bank rate.There has been a shortage of bills in London, as a natural consequence of the higher bank rates here, and this, no doubt, has been accentuating the depressing effect upon the open market rates of the rush of money to London for investment in bills.     At any rate the 5-g- per oent bank rate also showed no signs of being effective, because the three months&apos;   bill rate quickly fell to 4-f per cent and a further immediate fall in bank rate was expected in some quarters,Although the drain of gold on balance has for the time being coased, there has not yet been any material recovery in the Bank&apos;s holding of gold from the low level to which It had fallen before the bank rate was raised to 6^ per cent. The Bank Return for tho first week in Deoember showed a holding of  134,000,000 in gold, which is only  2,000,000 more than tho lewost figure in September, and is  20,000,000 less than the Bank1s gold holding at the beginning of tho year.      In spite of the enormous withdrawals of funds from New York, not much gold has left America yet.      The Reserve Bank&apos;s gold holdings there have fallen since the end of October by only 34 million dollars. Tho London gold position has so far only beon relieved at the expense of other oountries, such as Australia and the Argentine,The exchange position is more satisfactory than it has boen for a long time.     The New York exchange is nearing the import gold point, and the French Exchange, which has failed for so long to show any sign of the large shipments of gold from London to Paris, has at last risen definitely above the gold point.Money has been unusually tight in the London money market lately, probably because a good deal of the. new Conversion Loan has already been paid up in full under discount, and this Is having the effect of checking the fall in discount rates.    There is also during the past few days a falling off in the demand for bills from France that is having the same effect upon the discount rates here.The subscriptions to the new 5 per cent Conversion Loan issued In November amounted to  233,000,000 of which  79,000,000 took the form of 5-g por cent -&quot;G1&apos; Treasury Bonds 1930, offered in exchange, and the remainder ( 154,000,000) is cash to be paid up in full on or before the 1st February, 1930.The exchange of part of the 5-jjj por cent Treasury Bonds for 5 per cent Conversion Loan reduces the maturing debt next year (in the form of Treasury and Exchequer Bonds) to about  37,000,000, which is  67,000,000 less than the cash subscription of the new 5 per cent Conversion Loan,
THE MONEY MARKET (CONTD.)SIR GUY GRANET handed in the following report :-&quot;The situation in the Money Market has during the past month been rather irregular, as for the latter half of the above period the margin between the market discount rate and the value of call money has been unusually wide,    The bill rate has been about 4%% while discount houses have been paying 6% for Bank of England loans and 5 to 6% has frequently been ruling for call loan^.   Also the open market rate has for ,some days been around although the disparity between the official and market discount rates should normally be about 3/8% and not %% as at present. Usually when the rate for call money Is firm it is automatically reflected in the discount rate and the paradoxical situation outlined above Is probably to some extent due to the fact that the supply of London bills is Insufficient to meet the demand occasioned by the Inflow of funds invested in the New York call market previous to the financial collapse in that centre.&quot;if a decision to lower the Bank Rate depended solely upon the open market quotation it would have already been reduced to 5%, but other factors have also to be taken into account, the principal one being the low stock of gold held by the Bank of England.    The Bank Return on the &apos; 4th December showed a gold ratio to sight liabilities of about 27% as against a 46% ratio in the Return made by the Bank of France,&quot;During the last few days however both the Paris and New York Exchanges have made a decided movement in favour of London,    Francs have risen about fifteen points above the gold shipping point sinoe the last consignment to Paris made on the 4th December, and United States dollars are quoted 4.88 7/16 which is about quarter of a cent below the point at which shipments of gold can be made to London,    The development and maintenance of such a movement and a material improvement in the gold ratio would warrant a reduction in the official rate, or a reduction in .the Federal Reserve Rate to 4% would probably be quickly followed by a reduction to 5% here.&quot;The demand for London acceptance facilities has been fairly good and the recent decline in the market rate of discount has assisted business here.&quot;The announcement that the Bank of France are sponsoring efforts to create a real Money Market in Paris, and that a new Acceptance Bank has been formed, has been received with interest.    If their efforts are to be success-ful it will be necessary for the French to adopt a more liberal banking policy.    The.&quot;Paris market is narrow and difficult and it is not unusual to find discrepancies in the rates quoted by different Banks for the same Bank Acceptance of i per cent, or 3/8 per cent., according to whether the quotation is given by a Bank whose lines for the accepting Bank are full, or whose own rediscount limits with the Bank of I&apos; ranee are exhausted.    In the case of French trade paper the differences are still more accentuated, and instances have occurred where for the same prime paper rates differing by lw per cent, were quoted by leading Banks.&quot;
THE MONEY MARKET (CONTD.)After what Lord Bradbury has sa?.d the only thing Sir Guy Granet wanted to emphasise was that what was interesting the City at the present moment was the gold position;    they were looking forward to an improvement in the bank rate,, but he was not prepared to prophesy In regard to a possible   -consequent improvement in trade.GENERAL TRADE. Reports from the Federation of British Industries.i R. LENNOX LEE handed in the following reports:-General,The outstanding feature of current World, trade conditions is that it is now definitely established that a sharp decline In business is under way in the United States of america a . -Some idea of the unsettling effect of this decline on trade conditions In this country, notably in connection with our overseas activities, can be obtained from the following table showing the fall in prices, since the Wall Street collapse, of certain important raw materials, the producers of which are in the main important customers of this country:-Wheat (December) Chicago closing pr ic e.

The reductions in our bank rate are to be welcomed, though it seems doubtful whether the International situation will show much Improvement until money rates both here and in New York have fallen to considerably lower levels.
s is general TRADE  (OONTD. )Hardware and Cutlery,The state of trade In the cutlery Industry has been particularly good of late owing to a large increase in &quot;rush&quot; orders for Christmas trade.      It would appear that when this work has been completed manufacturers will find themselves badly placed as regards new business.     In the hardware department some seasonal increase In activity has been experienced, especially by those firms catering for heating stoves.     In the brass foundry department most firms are finding new business extremely difficult to secure.Boots and Shoes.Activity in the boot and shoe trade has been leather better of late but the tone of the market is not strong.     Those firms whose production goes direct to their own retail shops are reported to be rather better placed than other manufacturers as most of the orders which have been received are for immediate delivery. Export trade has continued to be fairly good, but the proposed increase in the Australian tariff is viewed with considerable apprehension.Engineering and Shipbuilding,The position of the engineering industry during the past month has improved to a slight degree owing to the placing of a number of orders.     This particularly applies to the shipbuilding trade and those sections of the industry who are receiving special, orders, resulting from the expenditure of money either under the Government unemployment schemes or else under the arrangement whereby the railways promise to expend certain sums on account of remission of rates.     Machine tool makers report that they have fairly satisfactory supplies of orders in hand, but the majority of these orders are for current delivery, very few long term having been secured of late.      In the constructional engineering department conditions have become extremely quiet.Reports from the Association of Chambers of Commerce.MR. MITCHELL read the following reports from the different districts:-Paper-makers in Edinburgh were having a difficult time; there had been a rise of about 50 per cent, in the price of raw material and over-production made it difficult to get the necessary increased price for paper.      In the electrical engineering industry there had been a slight improvement In business as compared with last year, but competition was still very keen.     The trade in manufactured stationery, for seasonal reasons, had been fairly busy during the last few months.     Export trade showed a marked improvement, but home sales showed a tendency to decrease.     The printing and allied trades were busy and prospects were good.   The future of the brewing trade, which was one of Edlnburgh&apos;s most prominent industries, was difficult to forecastj    during the past year it had proved satisfactory, but its future naturally depended on the spending power of the population.
GENERAL TRADE  (CONTD).Reports from the Association of Chambers of Commerce.  (Contd).Conditions in the imported meat market in Liverpool had been more satisfactory since his last report to&apos;the Council; frozen meat of all descriptions had been scarce, and the competition of home beef had been negligible.     The coal trade on the Mersey had remained in a depressed state during the whole of the month;    shipments to Ireland had fallen off very considerably owing to the keen competition from Scotland.     A slight Improvement had occurred In some shiprepairing yards. November had shown little improvement in the leather and tanning trade.     There was only a small demand for leather, as the boot and shoe business had not shown as much activity as was expected for the time of year.     Tanners, however, had maintained firm prices, as their stocks were not heavy.Co-operative Trade.MR. G. HAYHURST reported that the sales of the Co-operative Wholesale Society movement during the past month had Increased by about 5 per cent, as compared with November, 1928, totalling over 7f- million sterling.     When one part of the country Is down the other parts ar*e up, so that gives us a fair average on the whole.     The remarkable thing was that the people&apos;s deposits were Increasing, a very satisfactory feature.In regard to grocery and provisions the Danes put their butter prices up by 7s,6d, a cwt,, but they subsequently had to lower them.     With regard to  colonial butters, the Society has made great advances In New Zealand and Australian butters in preference to Irish, but Is still doing a large trade with Ireland,     The same applies to cheese from New Zealand with prices in favour of buyers, and to Canadian cheese.     Sugar developed a weakness during the month, but trade has been satisfactory.In regard to wheat, the Liverpool Futures market advanced 2s, a quarter^, Chicago Is,3d, to ls,6d., Winnipeg Is, whilst the Argentine closed ls,l^d, per quarter higher.In the United States the Federal Farm Board seems to be placing unlimited funds in the hands of different organisations for the maintenance of prices.     The world1s visible supply on the 1st November was 70 million quarters, by far the largest ever known, and over 6 million quarters higher than on October 1st last.A section of Canadian exporters are holding back supplies, their attitude being that they are prepared to let other countries export until such time as their next crop is reasonably assured.     This policy can have only one effect, namely, the stiffening of prices.&quot;The Australian new crop is  estimated at approximately 110 million bushels as against 165 million bushels last season. The surplus Is estimated to be 50 millions, and shipments are about to commence.* 480 lbs.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).Qo-operative Trade (Contd.).The tea market has continued very much on the same lines during the present month, the demand continuing good for most descriptions,Co-operative business with Russia during 19S9 amounted in all to  8,000,000,     During the year the Society also helped in regard to New Zealand with cheese, butter, dead meat and sundries.     From the Empire as a whole their trade amounts to about one hundred   millions sterling a year, so that they claimed to be doing their best for Empire trade.SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE observed that November had again proved a most difficult month, and trade had not been up to expectations.     After the unfavourable trading conditions in September and October, November had done little towards making up leeway, but there were reasons for believing that December, with the help of the Christmas trade, would make good some of the ground lost during the Autumn.Trade in the West End stores had not been good,    but departmental stores in the suburbs of London had done better and were not apparently hit so much as the better class trade. In the North, movements had been very similar to those in the South, and in Wales the same tendency operated.Retail Distributive Trade.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIPPING.MR.

RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  (Q03&apos;J?D.)SIR CYRIL HURC0M3   sent the following statement&quot;A further Improvement in the freight train receipts of tho four amalgamated companies was recorded during the four weeks ended 1st Deoember, 1929, oompared with the corresponding period in 1928,&quot;The Increase in the reoeipts from all descriptions oftraffio was  385,000, made up as follows:Increase.

Ooal, ooke and pa-sent fuel accounted for over 70 per oent of the inorease.     The relatively short haul and low rates of this class of traffic is reflected in the comparatively smaller increases in net ton-miles and reoeipts (6,2 per cent and 4,4 per cent respectively), and in the reduotion of 4d, in the average receipt per ton of all freight,        A reduotion in the average length of haul of ooal olass traffio suggests that a larger proportion was shipment traffio.      At the same time, so far as oan be asoortained, the increased tonnage of merchandise and minerals has mainly accrued in commodities in the lower classes.&quot;As regards selected commodities, substantial increases uere recorded in iron ore (34;i), pig iron (lo%) and steel (including sorap) (8%%), machinery 19%), limestone (other

(OO.JTD.)than for roadmaking)  (7%), bricks  (4%) and other commodities used in the building trade, bottles (16/j) , manure (47-!-$), cotton (25)&apos;j) and wool (23%;i,),&quot;In the iron and steel trade, there were increases of 32 per cent, in the production of pig iron and of 13 per cent, in tho production of steel in September, 1929, corn-pared with September, 1928, and figures furnished by the Ministry of labour show reductions in unemployment in the pig iron and steel trades from 4,292 to 2,182, and from 39,281 to 33,953 In September, 1928 and 1929, respectively.&quot;In the building trade, the unemployment figures were 91,845 in September, 1928, and 84,535 in September, 1929. The latter period was marked by exceptionally fine weather throughout11.EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS sent the following report ;-&quot;Between the end of October and 2nd December there was an increase in the numbers unemployed on tho Registers of about 63,500.     The increase was mainly in the numbers wholly unemployed, but there has also been some increase in the numbers temporarily stopped.&quot;The average Live Register during November was 1,267,520.:iIn the Southern Divisions the increase is again due almost entirely to seasonal oauses.      In the Midlands the numbers unemployed foil steadily during the first three weeks of the month, due mainly to an improvement in the coal mining and motor industries, but the figures have since shown an increase so that the position on 2nd December was about the same as at 28th October.      In the other Divisions there have been some slight fluctuations, but the general tendency has been shown in an increase in unemployment.     The recent bad weathor has been largely rosponsible for the increase during the latter part of the month.&quot;There has been a further improvement in ooal mining and the peroentage rate of unemployment at 25th November was 14.3.       There was, however, a decline In the iron and steel trades due partly to the closing down of a portion of the Ebbw Vale Stool &quot;works;     Shipbuilding and shiprepairing, howover, shows a slight Improvement.     There was a further decline in the cotton industry, but a very slight improve-ment in woollen and 7/orsted.     The building trade shows a heavy increase in unemployment, as is usual   at this time of the year,&quot;The total number of insured persons in employment at 25th&apos;November was about 56,000 less than at 21st October, but It is still about 246,0 00 greater than in November of last year.&quot;

AUSTRALIAN TRADE,MR. SANDERSON reported that from the 1st July to the 31st October a million and a half bales of wool had been received into store, and slightly -under     half a million bales sold.     There was still good buying competition by Bradford., the Continent, Japan and Russia,     With a view to protecting the wool industry and after considerable discussion extending over some years, the Commonwealth Government had Issued a proclamation prohibiting exports of stud sheep, unless with the consent of the Minister of Trade and Customs.Exports of wheat for the season ended 30th November amounted to over 80 million bushels as compared with 51s million bushels last season.     The exports of flour for the same period were 515,000 tons,  compared with 444,000 last season.     A pro-clamatlon operating from 1st January, 1930, required sacks containing flour to be marked in figures with the gross or net -weight of the contents, the principal object being the protection of the Australian exporter and retail purchaser In certain Eastern countries.The bank clearances from 1st January to 2nd December were,  959 million in Sydney and  749 million In Melbourne, an increase over last year of  6-g- million, and  47 million respectively.     The exchange position was difficult at the moment.     The Commonwealth Bank Bill, dealing with the&apos; question of gold, had passed through the lower House, but as it had not passed through the Upper House it was premature to say definitely what would be decided.As several members of tho Council had referred to the new Australian tariff, he would like to read some extracts from the High Commlssloner&apos;s statement on the matter.     Referring to the tariff classes under which British goods entered duty free, the statement said:-&quot;The new schedule leaves this most valuable form of preference almost completely unaffected.     The great value of this preference to British manufacturers will be appreciated when It Is considered that in the last year for which records are available, namely 1926-27,  29,000,000 worth of the total of British exports to Australia ( 62,000,000) entered Australia duty free, because of the fact that the goods were British.     The preferences which Australia affords to Great Britain under this heading alone is equivalent to a preferential rebate of over  3,000.-000, representing as large a preference as that given altogether by any other Dominion .The statement proceeded:-&quot;But in addition it should be realised that although the tariff has been considerably increased on a large number of goods on which there was already a protective tariff In Australia, the margin of preference has In all cases been maintained and in some cases increased.     As the intention of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has been not only to secure an Increased protection for certain Australian industries, but also to collect additional revenue, It Is clear that ha
GO NF IDEM? had.AUSTRALIAN TRADE  (CONTD ).anticipated the  continuation of a very considerable import trado in a largo percentage of the articles subjected to new treatment.      It may bo confidently expected therefore that in the majority of affuctod articles, British preference will continue to bo effective.&quot;Tho history of the trado to Australia since 1925, when the last tariff was put on, had shown that in spite of tho outcry at that time, considerable export trade from this country had boon maintained.     He would accept with somo hesitation some of the statements made that certain trades would be killed.     Great Britain, and Yorkshire in particular, had boen able in the piast, and would bo ablo in the future, to get over the difficulty.INDIAN TRADE.MR. GUPTA observed that the returns for the foreign trado of India for October showed a decrease both in imports and exports. Imports for October 1929 were 19 crores of rupees as compared with 21 crores in the same month last year, and exports were 26 crores as compared with 29 croros last year.The latest details were&apos;in respect of tho September trade. Imports of articles wholly or -mainly manufactured then showed a decrease, mainly due to smaller Imports of Iron and steel and cotton and woollen piece goods.     As regards exports there was an increase in September in food, drink and tobacco, due to an Increase in tea exports.     Raw materials and produce rose owing to increased exports ofraw jute, raw skins and seeds.      Articles wholly or mainly manufactured decreased, due to smaller exports of jute, gunny bags and cloth, though an increase occurred In the exports of cotton goods.Mr, Hardy, tho collector of Customs, Calcutta, who had been specially deputed to enquire into the incidence of tariff duties on Imported cotton piece goods, had now imported that, on administrative and other grounds, the substitution of specific duties for the ad valoren duties now in force was neither desirable nor practicableCOLONIAL TRADE.MR. VERNON stated that the report from East Africa showed an Increase of about 9 por cent,  in the total import traffic on the Uganda Railways in the first nine months of 1929, as compared with the same period of 1928.     The report from Uganda was also satisfactory and showed a considerable increase in the first 8 months of the year In tho value of domestic exports, the Increase being something like 30 per cent In the case of cotton. The exports of cotton from Tanganyika Territory were as yet only on a small scale, but they had Increased from 3,994 oentals in the first seven months of 1928 to 19,187 centals In the same period of 1929,
COLONIAL TRADES (CONTD.).The Gold Coast oxport trade showed a decline for the first eight months of the year, the valuo being  8,100,000 as against  8,800,000 during the corresponding period of last year.    This was mainly due to a decline in the price of cocoa. The Nigerian figures indicated a fairly considerable increase.The rubber exports from Malajra were still very high.    In October 1929 they were near 1 y&quot;48,0&quot;00 tons, which was less than September, but nearly double thoso for October 1928.    The whole of the increase this year appeared to be in Malayan rubber, not re-exported Dutch East Indian rubber.    For the first ten months of the year the groas exports were 482,000 tons as compared with 273,000 tons for the corresponding period of last year.    The output of tin and tin-ore from the Federated Malay States continued to increase, and the figure for the first ton months of 1929 was 55,000 tons compared with 51,000 tons In 1928.The Colonial Development Fund Advisory Committee was making considerable progress, and several important schemes had now been approved by them which would result in considerable orders and employment in this country.    The most important scheme to receive the Committeers approval up to the present time was that concerning the Zambesi Bridge, which included extensions in connection with railways and river steamerst    The cost would amount to about three and a half millions.   There was an air survey scheme in Northern Rhodesia.*   The Committee had approved a number of smaller projects and they foresaw an active and useful employment of the amount of money at their disposal for at least five years.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE stated that in Argentina the main subject of interest was the crops and their prospects.    There would be a serious falling-off because of the drought which occurred at the wrong time for the wheat crop, and a certain amount of land had been re-sown with maize.    The quantity of wheat that would be available would probably show a decrease of 25 per cent There had already been some orders received in connection with the D&apos;Abernon arrangement.    He thought that, although there would hot be much financial benefit arising out of that arrangement, it had cemented the good relations we had with the Argentina and would be extremely useful.The general situation In Chile was fairly good, but tbe position in the nitrate trade Bad rot righted itself, and, he was afraid,  o-ould not right itself for some time.    The coffee position in brazil was still&apos; difficult, though an arrangement had been made for a credit of  2,000,000, which had resulted in an increase in the amount of coffee allowed to be sold. In the meantime, other countries that produced coffee were profiting by the situation in Brazil.    Peru was in a position of some difficulty at present, and people trading with that country would need to exercise more than usual precaution.*-See &quot;The Times&quot; of the 10th Deoember.-26-
