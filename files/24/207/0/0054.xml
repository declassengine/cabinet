9 9ftET^ 63/29.CABINET,Copy No..-i 4Disposal of surplus munitipna to foreign countries. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. The recent decisions of the Cabinet restricting the sale of surplus munitions by the Service Departments affect the Board of Trade in two ways, firstly, in connection with their administration of the export lioence system, and, secondly,  in connection with the reaotions which the decision may be expected to have on British industry.2. With regard to the first, I shall be slad to have a clear definition of the duties of my Department with regard to the issue of export licences.     The present position is that all applications for licences to export war material are submitted for the observations of the Home Office, the Foreign Office, and the Service Departments, and, where necessary, to the India Office.     Every application is, therefore,  looked at from the point of view of the repercussions which a particular export of arms might be expected to have in the foreign country concerned and in the neighbouring countries, and also from the point of view of the military interests of this country - in fact, as far as possible, each application receives consideration from every point of view.     Having regard to the Cabinet decision that surplus arms should not be sold by the Service Departments to contractors when the ultimate destination of those arms is  to be a foreign Government, it is necessary for me to be clear whether I am expected to add to the enquiries I already make an enquiry as to the source of the arms.      It is true that in most cases at the present moment-1-
9 VIis tj my Department, who are in touoh with the trade, can ascertain whether the arms intended to he exported are new or are surplus, hut if at any time large manufacturers of arras in this country were to enter the trade in surplus arms It would be very difficult to ensure that surplus arms did not receive an export licence.     In view of the elaborate enquiries which are already instituted before an export licence Is issued,Ishould be glad to be relieved of the duty of making further enquiries as to the source of the arras.      In other words, I suggest that if the Departments consulted raise no objection to the Board of Trade Issuing a licence in a particular case, the Board shall Issue a licence without further enquiry.With regard to the second point, the  general question whether the 7/ar Office and the Treasury are to be deprived of such income as can be obtained by the sale of surplus arms is a matter which is primarily of Interest to those Departments.     There is, however, a further point with regard to the supply of ammunition for such arms.     ?/here British surplus arms are purchased by foreign governments there Is a natural tendency for them to come to us for ammunition, and the orders which we receive in consequence are of some importance from the point of view of trade and employment, quite apart from the political advantage mentioned by the Secretary of State for War in his memorandum (CF,361(29 ) ).W.O.Board of Trade,14th December, 1929.
