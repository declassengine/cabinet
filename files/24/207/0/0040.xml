REPORTTo the Rt. Ron. the Secretary of State for the Home Department *,   toy the Committee on Workmen1s Compensation (Compulsory Insurance).Sir,In March last we were constituted an informal official Committee to examine in detail the possibility of making insurance in respect of Workmen&apos;s Compensation liability oompulsory on employers,    We have now considered the matter in all its bearings and conferred with representatives of the Insuranoe Companies doing Workmen&apos;s Compensation business,  who also submitted their oase in writing.    We now beg to submit the conclusions at which we have arrived.The immediate cause of the Inquiry was the hardship and distress resulting from the numerous colliery liquidations which have taken place during the last two or three years.    Cases occur from time to time in which in default of insuranoe on the part of employers the workman has been deprived of his compensation (see on this the Report of the Departmental Committee on Workm&quot;&apos;en&apos;s Compensation, known as the Holman Gregory Committee, paragraph IB);    but a new situation has been created by recent events in the coal industry.    In most industries it is the common praotice of employers other than those who are large enough to undertake their own insurance to insure comprehensively against their liabilities under the Act and where this is done the injured workman is not prejudiced by the employer&apos;s insolvency as he is then entitled to claim his oompensa^ion direct from the insurers.    In the Coal Mining Industry, however, it is quite usual for the employer either not to insure at all,  in which oase the workman&apos;s only protection in the event of the insolvency of his employer is the provision in the Act which allows the capital value of the weekly compensation to rank as a preferential debt in the distribution of the estate, or to avail himself only of such insurance as can be obtained from one of the coalowners Mutual Indemnity Associations, which is often of a very partial character.    For example, many owners in the South Wales Coalfield are insured only with the South Wales and Monmouthshire Coalowners Mutual Indemnity Association, which limits its insurance to &quot;catastrophe&quot; risks, that is to say, accidents where more than three persons are killed or injured.    In oases where the employer is not fully oovered by insuranoe the workman may suffer hardship either by losing altogether the whole or part of his compensation or, where the assets may ultimately be sufficient to pay the preferential debts in full but the funds immediately available are insufficient, by being kept out of his compensation a long time pending the final settlement.    Inquiries covering the period sinoe the beginning of 1927 disclosed four cases of liquidation involving a permanent loss of compensation amounting to over  7,000 and involving PA workmen,  anil a large number of cases in which the workmen had been temporarily kept out of their compensation for prolonged periods and had been forced to have recourse to the Poor Law.    For example,  it appears from figures
supplied by the Pontypridd Guardians that, in the period 1st May to 11th December last, relief amounting to well over  2,000 was granted to 255 workmen whose weekly payments had been interrupted by the liquidations of the oollieries at which they were employed.In the state of things thus disclosed the only feasible remedy seemed to be some system of oompulsory insurance.A sysCem of compulsory insurance may take one or other of the following forms, or a combination of them, viz:  (l) State Insurance,  (2) the German System, under which the insurance oarriers are mutual trade associations of employers,  (3) the existing British System with compulsion added.The establishment of a System managed by the State and involving the creation of a State Fund was excluded from our reference, and our consideration was limited therefore to the possibilities of insurance through private companies or insurance undertaken by the industries themselves.In 1919 the whole question of Workmen1s Compensation was exhaustively examined by the Holman Gregory Committee.    Their Report, which was signed in July, 1920, included a recommendation that every employer, with certain exceptions * should be required to insure against Workmen&apos;s Compensation Risk. As regards insurance through the private insurance companies, the Committee found that on the whole it worked well, but regarded it as seriously extravagant - they found that in the previous five or six years &quot;the employers have had to pay  100 in premium for every  48 paid out in benefits to injured workmen&quot; and they expressed their views thus:    &quot;Where a liability created by Parliament makes it imperative for the outstanding majority of employers to cover their risk by insurance, we consider that \t is the duty of the State to ensure that the business shall be conducted on a reasonable and economical basis&quot;  (para,12).    Accordingly, after prolonged negotiations with representatives of the Insurance Companies an agreement was arrived at which was embodied in the Working Arrangement annexed to the Committee&apos;s Report, by which it was provided that, in future, at least 70 per cent, of the premium inoome should be expended in benefits to injured workmen or their dependants the remaining 30 per cent, to be available for the management expenses and profits of the Companies.When, in 1923, legislation based on these Recommendations was being considered,  it was decided not to propose any system of compulsory insurance, which had not been taken up with any warmth by either employers or workers, but - notwithstanding that the employers showed an equal indifference on this point also - to proceed with the Scheme for regulating the cost of Workmen1s Compensation Insurance to employers.    Negotiations were re-commenced with the Companies, who at first took up a difficult attitude, but on the Cabinet deciding that if a satisfactory arrangement could not be reached, the matter would have to be dealt with by legislation, the Companies oame to terms. The outcome was the following Undertaking which is operative at the present time.*     The exceptions were the Crown, a local or other public authority, a      . . statutory company or a householder in respect of servants not employed by him for the purpose of his trade or business.    Employers with an annual wage roll exceeding a certain sum were to be entitled to exemption on compliance with prescribed conditions.
The Accident Offices Association engages, on behalf of its constituent members, to adjust from time to time the rate of premium for this class of insurance in such a way as to make the &quot;loss ratio&quot;  (i.e. the proportion which the total amount paid or set aside in respect of claims bears to the premiums) not less than a fixed percentage.    For each of the years 1924, 1925 and 1926 the &quot;loss ratio&quot; was fixed at 60 per cent, and for subsequent years &quot;62-g- per cent, or such other proportion, not being less than 60 per oent. as may be agreed between the Secretary of State and the Accident Offices Association&quot;.    Under this provision the &quot;loss ratio&quot; for 1928 was 62g- per oent. If, on the ye&amp;r^s experience, it is found that the &quot;loss ratio&quot; falls short by more than one-half per cent, of the percentage mentioned, policy holders in the Companies belonging to the Association are to be allowed a corresponding rebate in connexion with the premium which next falls to be paid.    If, on the other hand, the &quot;loss ratio&quot; exoeeds the percentage by more than one-half per cent, an adjustment will be effected by means of an excess charge.This Scheme was carried through by the Home Office without any pressure or even support from the employers, from whom few oomplaints have been received as to the working of the present system.    Nevertheless, if a system sf compulsory insurance which would have to be oarried out largely through the medium of the Private Companies were to be proposed by the Government, the proposal would undoubtedly be attacked on the ground that the individual employer was being required to pay at an exosssive rate for the insurance. The cry would be raised that for every 6d. paid in benefits to the worker, the employer would be paying 10d.    Consequently our first step was to address ourselves to the Insurance Companies in order to investigate the possibility of obtaining better terms than under the present Undertaking.The Accident Offices Association appointed Sir Arthur Worley, C.B.E. and Mr. R. M&apos;Connell to discuss the subject with us and we had several meetings with these gentlemen.    They put the following considerations before us.In the first place,  sinoe 1920 the aggregate of premiums received had dropped from  8*851,607 to  5,848,202 in 1927,* as a result mainly of the general fall in wages, while the number of polioies remained much about the same, and the number of workpeople oovered had, in their opinion, even inoreased,    Secondly, stress was laid on the large proportion of the Companies business which was made up of quite small policies, the work in connexion with which, in the aggregate, involved muoh more time and trouble..   For instance, they stated that between 7 and 8 per cent, of their total premiums came from agriculture at an average premium of 48/-;    and that these risks are spread all over the Country, many of them in isolated places, so that evenPremiums 8,851,607  5,848,202Losses. 2,980,755  3,140,56533.67$ 53.70$Commission. 985,102  517,156ii.:8.84$Expenses. 1,936,857  1,402,16121.88$ 23.98$
- 4 -now it is found difficult to get Agents to collect new, renewal and adjustment premiums, obtain wages statements, and report claims, for the remunerationthey receive. Leaving Domestic Servants Insurance out of account, it was estimated that 78$ of all the risks on the books of Tariff Officeshigh.    It would not be fair, they urged, to compare Companies doing a business of this kind with Mutual Indemnity Associations dealing with a single homogeneous&quot; industry and large units.    Referring to the different factorswas made up of salaries, which in these days it would be difficult to reduce. As to commission, during the last seven years commission had been reduced by the Tariff Companies by nearly 25 per cent, from 11.7 per cent, to 8.8reduction would probably result in the agents    complete loss of interest in the smaller business.In these oir-cumstances the question whether any modification of the Undertaking with the Home Office was practicable would depend largely on the amount and nature of the additional business that would accrue to the Companies as a consequence of compulsory insurance.    To answer the question they said it was necessary to know not only how many employers were uninsured but also how many employees were left uncovered by insurance in respect of Workmen&apos;s Compensation Risk.    As to this they at present had no evidence.We have carefully considered the two questions raised by the discussions with the representatives of the Accident Offices Association, namely,  (l) whether reductions in the various items of expenditure normally incurred by Insurance Companies are possible, and (2) what access of business would acorue as a result of compulsory insurance.It might have been expected that under a change of system which, in place of the Insuranoe Companies having to employ agents to get business and collect premiums, would bring the customer to&apos; the Companies, a considerable saving would be effected under the heading of commission.    It appears, however, that this is not likely to be the case.    Under the existing Undertaking with the Home Office, a reduction in the rate of commission has already been made, and as long as a number of separate Companies exist, eaoh carrying on business in all parts of the country, any considerable reduction in the number of agents is not to be looked for.    It has also to be remembered that agents have other duties to perform in connexion with the reporting of claims,  etc.    As regards other expenses of management, the Companies maintained that there was no room for any reduction, and we think that as long as the present system of insurance continues their contention must be accepted.It remains to consider the extent to which the expense ratio would be affected by the inorease of business which compulsory insuranoe would bring. To answer this question it becomes neoessary to ascertain the number of emplo^ees, at present uncovered, who would be brought into insurance by a oompulsory measure.    On the data available the conclusion arrived at is that compulsion would bring into insurance nearly two million extra persons at themaking up the expense ratio, it was stated thatper cent, of the premium income.    Any attempt in the direction of a further
L*    See List of Mutual Associations and Industries conoerned in Appendix.present time and that when employment becomes normal this number would be increased by a further 500,000.    How many of these would accrue to the Insurances Companies is, of course, quite uncertain.    A considerable proportion are to be found in industries, e.g. mines, for which Mutual Associations exist, and might be expected to accrue to the Mutuals.We are satisfied that this increase of business should in some degree make a lower expense ratio possible, but we do not think the reduction would be very muoh.If therefore the position be accepted that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to require employers to insure under the system of private companies operating as indicated above, it becomes neoessary to consider the possibilities of insurance through Mutual Indemnity Societies established by the industries themselves.In Germany, as we have seen, the establishment of such Associations for purposes of accident insurance has been made obligatory by law.    In Great Britian their establishment, where they have been set up, has of course been on a voluntary basis and will presumably remain so, but it seems probable that the imposition on employers of an obligation to insure might give a considerable stimulus to their establishment or . extension.Some account of Mutual Associations and their methods is given in the Holman Gregory Report (page 14).    The advantages of the system from the point of view of the employer are obvious.    Profit is eliminated and &quot;generally speaking any surplus of income over expenditure is disposed of by being either carried to the reserve or carried forward to the next year thus reducing the demandB for that year.    In some cases either the whole or part of the surplus is returned to members as bonus&quot;.    Further, the Association being on an industrial basis and in some cases very much localised, the business is muoh easier to handle and therefore much more economical to conduct.It is surprising, therefore, that the system has not been more widely resorted to.    There are, it is true, a large number of Mutual Indemnity Associations which insure employers belonging to a variety of industries *. and in oertain of the chief industries the bulk of the insurance is effected by these Associations.    For example, in the mining industry in 1927 nearly 71 per cent, of the compensation was paid by Mutual Associations, and in the ootton industry no less than 79 per cent.    There are, however, a number of industries in which the Mutual Associations are either non-existent or cover only a small part of the field,    In the case of small, miscellaneous and scattered industries, the establishment of Mutual Associations would be difficult, and the advantages of mutual insurance would largely disappear - the business would approximate in character to that of an ordinary Insurance Company. On the other hand, in the important industries, well organised and largely centralised, the system of mutual insurance seems both possible and desirable.
9  ? 9These are a.&quot;.so the great accident producing induotri&amp;s^ and if&quot;they-oo-uld be-oovered by a requirement of compulsory insuranoe the chief part of our problem would be met.    A suggestion has been made which has attractions, that the obligation to insure should not be made universal but applied selectively to the trades and industries which, being self-contained and organised, and usually having, moreover, the characteristic of a high accident risk, could without any great difficulty, and with the stimulus of compulsory insurance probably would, establish a Mutual Association.    If the idea oommended itself to the Government a beginning might be made in the coal-mining industry where a problem of some urgency has already arisen.Whether it is found practicable or not to prooeed with such a scheme, there are certain features about the system of insurance through Mutual Associations which require the consideration of the Government,The Assurance Companies Act, 1909, requires an Insuranoe Company to lodge a deposit of  20,000.    The purpose of this requirement is to prevent the promotion of Companies without substantial financial baoking.The same Statute requires Insurance Companies to furnish to the Board of Trade Returns which include the amounts put aside as Reserves for Unexpired Risks and the Liability for Outstanding Claims.Mutuals are exempt from both these statutory requirements..On the question of reserves, the Holman Gregory Committee reported as follows:-&quot;No cause of default by a mutual association was brought to our notice, but it is a fundamental principle of sound insurance finanoe that the total liability in respect of claims arising in each year should be provided for out of the contributions paid in that year, and that there should be adequate reserves for unexpired risks.    In our view, whatever degree of control is imposed in this respeot upon Insurance Companies trading for profit should be imposed on Mutual Associations,  subject to the exception that, in the case of Mutual Associations, the deposit of  20,000 which is required from Insurance Companies oan be dispensed with&quot;.The Olauson Committee on the Assurance Companies - Act,  1909,  came to a similar conclusion, according to their Report (p.xii):-&quot;The Committee are satisfied that there is no reason why such Mutual Associations should not be under the same responsibilities as regards furnishing accounts and information as to their business and financial position as any other insuring body;    but they are of opinion that, when such an association is formed by a body of responsible employers, there is no need, in the public interest, to require a deposit from them, and for this reason the Committee propose (see Clause 33(c) of the Bill) to enable the Board of Trade to dispense with deposits from such associations&quot;.On this point, it must be borne in mind that if inadequate Reserves were disclosed in any particular instance the Board of Trade could invoke the powers of inspection given by Clause 21 (l) (b) of the Draft Bill and the power of winding-up&apos; given by Clause 19(c).
fyj iSl QAs regards the question of a deposit we feel that the considerations which are relied upon to justify the exemption of Mutuals from the obligation to make deposits are only applicable when the employer is at liberty to insure in respect of Workmen&apos;s Compensation Risk or not, as he pleases, and that the situation would be entirely altered were a system of compulsory insurance to be instituted.      The purpose of compulsory insurance is to secure compensation to the injured workman or his dependants without reference to his employer&apos;s ability to pay such compensation.     If the   Mutual Association is to bo the means of securing the payment of such benefits, we feel that no precautions against financial instability ought to be omitted.     Under such a system of compulsion as we have contemplated above, a powerful stimulus would be given to the formation of new Mutual Associations,   and an initial deposit of suitable amount would serve to deter the man of straw who might be tempted to establish a proprietary concern of an unsubstantial character under the guise of a Mutual Association.     We accordingly recommend that a deposit - not necessarily of the same amount as that required from Insurance Companies -- should be required from all Mutuals operating within the sphere of the compulsory scheme.we have consulted the Board of Trade and they have expressed the opinion that if a Scheme of Compulsory Insurance in connection with Workmen&apos;s Compensation risk is decided upon, Mutual Associations should be required to make a deposit.we recommend that the Draft Insurance Undertakings Bill should be amended accordingly.Finally,  there is a very important defect, which requires to be remedied, in the conduct of the business of some Mutuals.   . Those Mutuals make yearly levies from their members to meet the expenditure of the year, and do not undertake any further liability in respect of a member after he ceases to be a member.      This involves a serious hardship when a firm ceases to be a member through insolvency, as the injured workman nay not be able to recover either from the employer or from the Mutual.      Under the law as laid down in Daff v. The Midland Colliery Owners Mutual Indemnity Company,  6 B.W.C.C.799, and Pailin v. The Northern Indemnity Company Limited,  IS B.W.0.C.32, it is possible for a Mutual&apos; Indemnity Association to frame its Articles on these lines.     we are of opinion that it is essential for the protection of the workman that the law should be so altered as to preserve unaffected the continuing liability of the insurers in all cases of insolvency.One point was raised in the course of V&apos;e investigations which, although not strictly relevant to our Inquiry, needs consideration.    At their conferences with us the representatives of the Insurance Companies claimed that it would be only equitable if they were permitted to charge under the head of Payments under Policies, the whole cost of the settlement of claims. At present only Medical and Legal Expenses are allowed to be included under that head, the rest of the costs incurred in settling claims being borne as part of the Company&apos;s expenses of management.     This is so both in the Returns required to be made to the Board of Trade under tho Assurance Companies Act, 1909  (sec First Schedule, Form D) and in the Form of Certificate furnished
CM. KNOWLES, Secretary.OME OFFICE. 14th November,  1929.to the Home Office under the terms of the Undertaking for the limitation of charges in respect of Employers Liability Insurance.     Some support is lent to the Company&apos;s proposal by the fact that, in the draft new Bill appended to the Report of the Departmental Commxttee on the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, the Note indicating what is to be included under the head of payments under Policies has been amended so as to read &quot;all expenses directly incurred in settling claims&quot;  (Fourth Schedule, Form E. p.56).It would be impossible to accept the proposal of the Accident Offices for thp purposes of the Auditors1  certificate furnished to the Home Office under the Undertaking above mentioned, inasmuch as the Companies would be given uncontrolled discretion to determine what expenditure is to be charged under the head of &quot;Payments under Policies&quot;, and the figures would be practically valueless for the purpose of comparing the benefits actually received by workmen with the premiums paid by employers.     Ww are not aware of the circumstances which led to the departure, in the Form of Return drafted by the Departmental Committee, from the terms prescribed by the Assurance Companies Act,  1909, but we venture to think that this point should receive further consideration before the Bill for amending the Assurance Companies Act is introduced, especially if it is deoided to adopt a scheme of compulsory insurance in respect of Workmen&apos;s Compensation risk.We have the honour to be Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed) JOHN ANDERSON (Chairman) MALCOLM DELEVINGNE WALTER S.
