I This Dooament is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&quot;s Government, j Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    28CP. 343 (29).CABINET.SITUATION IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Mr. LUNN informed the House of Commons on the 4th November that His Majesty&apos;s Government received no warning from the Palestine Government as to the imminence of the recent outbreak. If there should be a renewal of disorder in the near future, it would not be possible to make a similar statement. A series of warnings has been received both from the Palestine Government and from other sources, and I think that the time has come for me to bring the matter to the notice of my colleagues. A memorandum compiled in the Colonial Office and summarising the material available is circulated with this note.The most authoritative of the warnings are those contained in telegrams from the High Commissioner, copies of which were circulated to the Cabinet at the time of their receipt. It is not easy to estimate their precise weight. It is perhaps not unfair to remark that the telegrams dealt primarily with the rather controversial question of the reduction of the emergency garrison, and that the High Com-missioner&apos;s opinion as to the general situation may possibly have been somewhat coloured by his anxiety to resist the pressure which was being put upon him to accept the withdrawal of certain forces.It should also be noted that some, at any rate, of the information received has the appearance, in the absence of exact knowledge as to the reliability of the informants, of being little better than &quot;bazaar rumour,&quot; and further that both Jews and Arabs (especially Arabs) have shown a tendency to exploit alarmist reports as levers for forcing the Government to make concessions to their demands.It is also worth recording that anticipations of trouble on certain critical dates, such as the Day of Atonement on the 14th October and the anniversary of the &quot;Balfour Declaration &quot; on the 2nd November, were not in the event fulfilled.Nevertheless, after making all allowances, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the situation is one of great delicacy and not without some danger.P.November 28, 1929.Memorandum.The warnings of further disturbances which have been received may be classified according to their source under the following heads : A. -The High Commissioner personally.B. Official Reports received through the High Commissioner. C. Other reports as to Arab activities. D. Secret Intelligence Reports. E. Local Press.In addition, it is possible to quote F. Instance of a warning falsified by the event.[20214]f
A.(1.) High Commissioners Telegram No. 189 of September It).&quot;Secret. The following is an Arab point of view, not without interest and importance, regarding the recent disturbances. No disappointment is felt at circumstance that disturbances were promptly suppressed, and the explosion has in no sense assuaged anti-Jewish feeling which inspired them.Disturbances, on the contrary, are regarded as having been a trial of strength, the results of which have been most satisfying to the Arab extremists in that they learned from them two things, firstly, that i^arabs in practically all other parts of Palestine where it was possible followed Jerusalem&apos;s example very rapidly; secondly, that Arabs in Trans-Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Iraq gave sympathetic response which was from their point of view prompt, adequate, gratifying and full of promise for the future. This view of situation is confirmed by much other evidence.&quot;(2.) High Commissioner&apos;s Telegram No. 204 of September 19.&quot;Following factors have to be taken into consideration in estimating the size of future garrison : First, the latent deep-seated hatred of the Arabs for the Jews has now come to the surface in all parts of the country. Threats of renewed attacks upon the Jews are being freely made and are only being prevented by visible presence of considerable military force. Recent events have united all Moslem factions in Palestine in hostilit)^ to Jews and in lesser degree to the Government, while Christian Arabs, partly through dislike of Jews and partly through fear of Moslems, are associating themselves with the latter in this attitude. I am informed that fraternising of Moslems and Christians in opposition to Jews has extended to Syria. Secondly, there are still in the new quarters of Jerusalem and in Telaviv consider-able numbers of Jewish refugees from the old city of Jerusalem, Hebron and the smaller Jewish settlements who dare not return to their homes until assured of adequate protection from attack. Such protection can at present only be afforded by the presence in those places of guards of British troops or British police. Thirdly, it has yet to be seen how Jewish Feast in October will pass off and what will be the effect on public opinion of infliction of punishment for offences committed during the disturbances. Fourthly, recent outbreak in Palestine had serious repercussions in Syria and the French were genuinely apprehensive of Moslem rising in Syria in support of Palestine co-religionists. Propaganda against immigration of Jews into Palestine has recently been conducted amongst Arabs in neighbouring countries on an extensive scale, and if there is a recrudescence of the disturbances in Palestine it is doubtful if incursions into Palestine by Arabs from beyond the frontier could again be prevented. From information that has reached me I believe it is not improbable that if, in their opinion, the British Forces in Palestine are reduced to such an extent as to endanger the peace of Syria, the French Government will make representations to His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject.Finally, in view of obligations undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Mandate and of world-wide criticism to which Mandate and the Government of Palestine have been exposed by recent events, I regard it as essential that no risk should be incurred of a repetition of disorder, and I submit that no considera-tions of economy should be allowed to stand in the way of providing the Government of Palestine with sufficient force to enable it to assure maintenance of order and safety of life and property of the Jewish population. Taking all these circumstances into consideration I am of the opinion, in which my civil advisers concur, that no reduction of infantry force now in Palestine can safely be made until after the Day of Atonement and until after infliction of punishment for offences committed during the disturbances. By the time that those events are past it is possible that the situation may have so improved as to permit of the withdrawal of one battalion; but even that reduction would probably have to be conditional on my being able to count upon receiving reinforcements from Egypt next April during Nebi Musa week which in view of the recent trouble is likely to be a critical time.&quot;
(3.) High Commissioners Telegram No. 245 of October 12.&quot;The situation continues, highly unsatisfactory. The feeling of the Arabs against the Jews is still bitter. Boycott is being enforced and instigators are working clandestinely and avoiding detection. There is amongst the Arabs a growing feeling of hostility to the Government, which is being fomented by skilful propaganda conducted by Arab leaders. I am informed that this feeling is not as previously confined to political circles, but has now extended to lower classes of the population and to villagers. Apart from continued protests against injustice of Balfour Declaration the Arabs have recently submitted to me numerous complaints of injustice such as retention of Mr. Bentwich in the office of Attorney-General, harsh treatment they are receiving in being denied bail and heavy sentences awarded to them as compared with sentences on Jews convicted of similar offences. The issue of instructions to regulate proceedings at the Wailing Wall has been used to excite religious fanaticism of the Moslems. It is represented that these Regulations constitute a violation of the status quo in favour of the Jews and an encroachment on Holy Places of the Moslems. A full meeting of the Arab Executive has been summoned for the 12th October to consider the question of calling a general strike as a protest against the Regulations and other alleged acts of partiality and injustice. Younger Moslems declare that strike will be held whether the Executive approve it or not. The Chief Justice has informed me that a general policy of obstructing work of Assize Courts has been adopted by Arab members of the Bar. In cross-examining witnesses Counsel waste time on trivial and reiterated questions and when checked by the Court for wasting time they withdrew from the case leaving the prisoner without defence. The Chief Justice who has discussed the position with me has decided to proceed with trials even if prisoners are undefended. This will probably lead to complants that they have been denied justice and will be a further cause of excitement.Unrest will be further increased when collective punishments are inflicted on villages found guilty of looting. It is reported that passive resistance will be offered to sentences, so that fines may have to be collected by force. There is also probability of disturbance on the 2nd November, anniversary of Balfour Declaration. In conclusion, I would point out that if there is another outbreak it would be more formidable than the last, for the Arabs have recently obtained a considerable number of arms from Trans-Jordan and Hedjaz, and support from Arabs across the border would almost certainly be forthcoming. Taking all these circumstances into considera-tion I and my civil advisers are of the opinion that troops in Palestine cannot at present prudently be reduced below three battalions. I have discussed the position with the Air Vice-Marshal; he has suggested, in order to meet the wishes of the War Office, that the Green Howards should return to Egypt and a battalion should be brought from Malta as soon as possible to relieve them. As I see no likelihood even after present crisis of it being possible to reduce British troops below two battalions, this arrangement should not involve heavy expenditure, because as soon as situation admits of reduction to two battalions the South Wales Borderers could return to Egypt.&quot;(4.) High Commissioners Telegram No. 264 of October 19.&quot; In opinion of competent observers, situation in Palestine is for the first time since outbreaks were suppressed definitely dangerous. The Moslem population appear to be approaching a state of desperation on account of Governments failure to meet their wishes in any way. This feeling is not confined to the leaders only, but has spread to the lower classes and to the rural population.It requires only the smallest incident to provoke an outbreak on the part of the Arab population, and if such an outbreak should occur it will probably not be confined to Palestine itself, but will spread to neighbouring countries. I have just been informed by French Consul-General that there were disturbances in connection with Wailing Wall regulations in Beirut and Damascus yesterday.One of the chief factors enabling the ill-disposed to keep public opinion inflamed and causing perturbation among the ignorant Arab masses is delay in settling the Wailing Wall question.&apos;&apos;[20214]
(6.) Extract from Demi-Official Letter from High Commissioner to Sir J. Shuckburqhof October 18.&apos;&apos; I hope that the Arabs will remain quiet during the inquiry; but I am quite certain of this, that unless, as the result of the inquiry of the Commission, they obtain some concessions and the ambitions of the Zionists are curbed, there will be a rebellion.That is the opinion of the people who know the country best.&quot;B.(1.) M. Ballereau, an official of the French Foreign Office and late French Consul at Jerusalem, in conversation with the High Commissioner on the 13th September, expressed the opinion that only the presence of British troops in considerable force had prevented the renewal of outbreaks, and expressed the earnest hope that there would be no reduction of the force then available.(2.) High Commissioner s Despatch Secret (a) of October 24, 1929.Report of conversation with M. Ponsot, French High Commissioner for Syria. Extract from summary of what M. Ponsot said :  &quot;When the Commission of Enquiry issued their report, His Majesty&apos;s Government must make a declaration of policy that Avas less unyielding to the Arab demands than they had hitherto done, otherwise further outbreaks were inevitable; but that would not be easy because the Jews were very powerful and could bring influence to bear on many questions.&quot;(3.) Police Summary for Week ending October 5.Report from Haifa sub-district that arms are being smuggled both from Syria and Trans-Jordan.(4.) Police Summary for Week Ending September 21.- Ifci,is (?,tated that Shekib Wahab, Syrian revolutionary leader, in conversation with the Grand Mufti, offered to organise bands for a guerilla campaign to last not less than a year. The Grand Mufti reported to have considered this unnecessary at present.(5.) Police Report for Week Ending October 12.t n,ReAOTu  f meefcinS of leading Moslem and Christian merchants at offices ot the Arab Executive. In the course of the debate some members spoke openly in favour of revolution : &quot; That a general rising is the only means to save the country is common talk among all classes of the population; also that the people have become desperate and unmindful of risks; further, villages are stated to have become affected by political propaganda and by the economic depression, influenced by purchase of lands by Jews and resultant ejection of Arab farmers.&quot;&quot; In view of information given in my telegram No. 264, 19th October, I must deprecate in the strongest manner the withdrawal of the third battalion. Open weakening of the garrison is sure to encourage the ill-disposed, and at the present time is imprudent to the highest degree.&quot;
(6.) Police Report for Week Ending October 19.&quot;It is rumoured in Safad that 400 men selected to form an armed force  money being collected for purchase of arms by the ex-Mayor of Safad, 350 said to have been already enrolled : object reprisals against Jews in the event of death sentences or long terms of imprisonment.&quot;(Note. Situation report, 15th November, reports sniping at Safad.)(7.) Police Report for Week Ending October 26.In connection with Safad sentences. Gangs of criminals to attack Jews and British officials have been formed and will first function in areas at Haifa and Nablus. Rumours are current in Nablus that a band of over 150 robbers from Safad and Syria and Jebel Druse are concentrating near Syria Frontier to attack Jews. There are other rumours that the Arab Executive is arranging to form gangs in each town and village, and that Sultan El Atrash will attack Safad(8.) Secret memorandum from O.C., Arab Legion (Trans-Jordan), to British Resident at Amman (Trans-Jordan), the 28th September, reporting a recent meeting of Sheikhs, who appear to have (a) discussed the possibility of marching armed force into Palestine : not agreedto but arranged that in event of another outbreak Trans-Jordan Arabs should join en masse.(b) decided to postpone question of forming bands of brigands to enterPalestine until advice of Syria and Palestine had been taken.(c) unanimously decided to raise money to buy arms and ammunition forPalestine.Lieutenant-Colonel Peake&apos;s conclusion is that no overt act of large scale aggres-sion against Palestine is to be expected unless disorders break out again. Outbreak of armed brigandage is to be expected.(9.) Intelligence summary of the 10th October from Trans-Jordan Frontier Force : 1. It is reported that approximately 50 rifles and a quantity of ammunition were taken into Safad from Kuneitra during the previous week, and that officials of the Syrian Government were paid to assist in safeguarding the transhipment of the consignment.This is the second occasion in the last four weeks that arms have been imported into Safad. 2. It is further reported that about 18 camel loads of tombac, arrak, arms and ammunition entered Palestine from the Jericho area, and that the smugglers were 12 men of Abu Diss Village, assisted by two of the Customs Officials at the Allenby Bridge, with 18 Bedu of the Adwans with some Syrians.According to reports, the camels proceeded to a point in the hills 7 miles from Jericho, where the arms, &amp;c, were hidden for three days in a cave.The Arrak, with some tombac was then sent to Ramallah and Tulkarem Areas.The arms, ammunition and the rest of the tombac was sent to Hebron and Beersheba Areas by way of the Nebi Musa Mosque-Khadr-and Beit Sahor to Hebron.This consignment was hidden in the vineyards and afterwards part of it was unloaded in Hebron, the remainder being sent to Beersheba District.3. A band of well-armed men was formed in Safad last week, and took to the country with the object of attacking Jews.It is stated that this is one of many similar bands which will be formed in the near future for the same purpose.It is thought that larger bands will be formed in the Beersheba Area.
Experienced bandits are being consulted as to the best means of carrying out guerilla warfare, which may commence after the Com-mission from London arrives and completes its report.Committees are being formed in many parts of Palestine for the purpose of helping these bands.4. It is understood that arms are not at present being sent from Amman and Es Salt, the areas operated being Ffule and Tiberias in the North and to Wadi Muso in the South.5. The tribes of Bashanti and Sukhr have formed an alliance for participation in action when it takes place.The tribes of Hanadi have not joined them, and insist on remaining neutral.   The Arabs are in Beisan-Ajluh Areas.6. It is believed that whilst Arabs are active in persuading the public to remain quiet throughout the country until the decision of the British Govern-ment is known, preparations are being made all over Palestine for a general uprising, well-armed and organised for action, against the Jews if the Jews commit further actions against the Arabs.7. It is understood that in the event of any action by the Jews for which they can be regarded as legally responsible, the Arab Communities will not hesitate to attack them by all means at their disposal, and at whatever cost.(10.) Report by Commandant of Police of General Assembly of Arab Congress at Jerusalem the 27th October, called by the Executive, at which delegates, including Bedouin Sheikhs from all parts of Palestine were present, and some representatives from Trans-Jordan, but no tribal Sheikhs. Great enthusiasm and determination to &quot; save the country,&quot; even at the cost of their lives, was manifested. Judging from the attitude of the Assembly, it was apparent that the people were in a state of extreme excitement that approximated to a revolutionary disposition. It is said that the Arabs now await the &quot;decision&quot; of the Commission, and if these are unsatisfactory the only course open to them is a general uprising. They are in a state of despair, and openly accuse the Government and state that life is becoming unbearable. It is felt that any further step taken by the Jews or the Government which is likely to give offence to the Arabs would lead to an outbreak. The least spark is sufficient to set the country in flames. It should, however, be added that reference is made in the report to the presence of moderating influences.(11.) Report of British Resident, Trans-Jordan, on the political situation.The people have been persuaded to believe ill of the English during the recent election -campaign when the question of religion was not made use of, and it is obvious that this incipient distrust can easily be turned into hatred if the people are told that the British are arranging that their Holy Places be given to the Jews.A definite step in this direction was taken by the Arab Executive in their recent telegram regarding the Wailing Wall when they declared that the Government had turned it into a synagogue.The Arab Executive appears to have aroused the sympathy of the Moslem World and will, I imagine, do their utmost to the end that this opportunity of ridding Palestine of the Balfour Declaration shall not escape them.Trans-Jordan was kept out of the riots in August because the Palestine problem was not to the fore in the minds of the people and because a plan of action had not been prepared. Should a further outburst against the Jews be arranged, I fear the country might not behave so well.C.Other Reports as to Arab Activities.(1.) Mr. Ketchum&apos;s report in &quot;Daily Express&quot; of the 2nd September. This was referred to the High Commissioner in the following telegram : &quot; &apos; Daily Express &apos; to-day contains report of alleged statement by Grand Mufti to special correspondent Ketchum, from which following are extracts :  &apos; This is a serious national revolution, the reverberations of which may soon be heard in every corner of Moslem Arabia.   We are faced at this moment
with a grave national rebellion, in which we have the sympathy, and, if need be, should have the support, not only of the Moslem Arabs of Syria and Egypt and North Africa, but of the whole of Arabia with its sixty millions of people &apos;;and&apos; Ultimate peace in Palestine and Arabia will never be made while Great Britain continues to pursue the policy of the Balfour declaration.&apos; &quot;On enquiry being made, the Grand Mufti denied the authenticity of the account; but Mr. Ketchura persisted, confirming his statement with some written evidence of its accuracy.(2.) Intercepted letters between Haj Amin (the Grand Mufti) and Central Khalifat Committee, Bombay; and also a report from, a reasonably reliable source that the Grand Mufti offered his services to the King of Egypt in furtherance of the latter&apos;s ambitions in respect of Khalifat, saying that Palestine was the one place under British rule where Moslems could without difficulty carry out anti-British agitation.(3.) An eminent Jewish source has mentioned Ahmad Zeki Pasha (of Egypt) as intriguing with the Grand Mufti. No confirmation has been received, but it appears that he been associated with various intrigues and had dealings with the Riffi and with Gordon Canning, whom the High Commissioner wished to exclude from Palestine, but subsequently admitted on his giving &quot; satisfactory &apos;&apos; explanations, but who has been very active since his arrival, and whose presence is regarded with suspicion by the French. It may be mentioned here that in a recent telegram to the Prime Minister, Canning said : &quot; Hope can keep peace a while; after that only force of arms.&quot;(4.) Report of Confidential Interview on September 29 between Mr. Luke and Musa Kazim Pasha (President of the Arab Executive in Palestine).Musa Kazim said that if the report of the Commission did not result directly or indirectly in restatement of Jewish National Home policy giving relief to Arab anxiety there would be an armed rising, which in his opinion and that of the Arabs generally would involve participation of Moslems from Syria, Trans-Jordan and perhaps Iraq. He also said that any executions of Arabs would be deeply resented.(5.) Several messages received from His Majesty&apos;s representative in Mexico as to a shipment of arms from and collection of funds in Mexico for use by Arabs in Palestine. It is stated that depots for storage of arms exist at three centres (one of which, Kuneitra, is mentioned independently at B 9). Nablus is also referred to.  Other details as to supposed preparations are given.(6.) In an official letter of the 5th November from the Zionist Organisation to the Colonial Office, pressing for re-establishment of sealed armouries for Jewish Colonies, the Zionist Organisation emphasised the urgency of the matter on the ground that during the rainy season Colonies would be much less accessible to troops, while the tension between the Jewish and Arab population continues and is not likely to abate as long as the trials and the work of the Enquiry Commission are in progress.d.Secret Intelligence Reports.(1.) A secret intelligence report dated the 13th November from a source in close touch with Palestinian Arab nationalists, which has proved reliable in the past, states that a secret Committee called the Boycott Committee has been formed for terrorist purposes with a view to the assassination of persons considered to be acting against Arab nationalist interests. After one warning, anyone who continues his activities to be killed by members selected by the Committee. Said to have been formed with knowledge and consent of Supreme Moslem Council and Arab Executive who have subscribed to expense. One man accused of making Arabs sign petitions in favour of Jews was assassinated 21st October. After meeting of the 17th October, warning was sent to Judge Litt and other warnings decided upon at Committee
smeeting 19th October. A later report, also from a secret intelligence source, gives further details concerning the &quot; Boycott Committee.&quot; It consists of 24 persons, eleven of Avhom are stated to be members of the Palestinian Communist Party. It appears to have organised its murder campaign quite effectively. In this connexion it may be mentioned that, in a recent demi-official letter, Sir J. Chancellor reported, as a disquieting feature of the situation, that the (Arab) sources of information hitherto available to the police in Palestine had almost completely &quot;dried up.&quot; This may be an indication that the terrorist policy of the &quot; Boycott Committee &quot; is meeting with some success.(2.) Another report of same date indicates that the Wafd in Egypt has been in correspondence through Mustapha Nahas with the Grand Mufti and the President of the Arab Executive, encouraging their resistance to the British Government and promising moral and financial assistance. Similar support has been promised by other members of Wafd. Nahas has been urged by the Indian Khalifat Committee to help the Palestine Arabs in their struggle against British Imperialism. He replied on the 24th October that Wafd were doing all they could to assist Palestinians but would be in a better position to help after they had assumed power.E.The Arab press continues to be very inflammatory, in particular a paper which is now for the first time published in English. There is pressure for an extension of the terms of reference of the Commission of Enquiry so as to enable it to investigate the &quot;true&quot; cause of previous and recent outbreaks as well as the &quot; immediate &quot; causes.   Otherwise, it is argued, further disturbances are inevitable.F.As an instance of a warning falsified by the event, it may be worth mentioning that a Jewish settler in Palestine named Mr. Kurt Levy called at the Colonial Office on the eve of the 2nd November (Balfour Declaration Day) urging that an immediate announcement should be issued calling a joint conference of Arabs and Jews in conciliatory terms on the express condition that the Arabs kept quiet on the 2nd November. Mr. Levy said that he was convinced that unless some such step was taken a further general disturbance was certain to occur. As a matter of fact, beyond a strike and general closing of shops, this critical day passed off quietly.Colonial Office, November 1929.o
