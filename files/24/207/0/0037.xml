November 30th,  1929.
Sir Alfred Watson.Further to our conversation on the memorandum which you circulated relative to the finance of the Unemployment Insurance Bill and the Retirement Pensions scheme, on the premise that they both become Law,   and to the covering note which you were good  enough to send to me,  I now understand-that you agreed that I  should be broadly correct in thus explaining the position to my colleagues.-A direct saving in State grant to Unemployment Insurance Benefit arises to the amount of two million,   vhich reduces the cost of the Pension scheme in the first year from 21.6 millions to 19.6.  (Page four of your memorandum.A further saving arises of 8.2 millions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.I suggested that in viev? of this saving of 3.2 millions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund the remaining grant from the Exchequer to Unemployment Insurance Benefit - 6.5 millions need not be made.      In that event the net cost of  the Retirement Pensions scheme to the Exchequer in the first year would be reduced from 19.6 millions to 15.1.These figures relate only to the first yeer, as in subsequent years the saving to the Unemployment Insurance Fund declines rapidly,  together with the cost of the Retirement Pensions scheme.      You were good enough to say you would let me have figures for subsequent je&amp;rs at a later stage.(Intld.) O.M.
