November 1929.Copy No.     36CABINET.SUPPLY OF CRUISERS TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.Supplementary Memorandum.       ,[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.^WITH reference to the memorandum on supply of cruisers to the Chinese Government, CP. 324 (29), it has now been ascertained that under the Treaty of Washington Act, 1922, the Admiralty have no power to refuse a licence for the export of a warship unless such refusal is necessary to secure the observance of the Washington Treaty relating to limitation of armaments. This does not affect the considerations put forward in the memorandum in question except that, with reference to the penultimate sentence, Messrs. Vickers could not be informed that no licence will be issued. They could only be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment disapproved of the proposed transaction, and if they persisted in it there would be no legal means of stopping them.Foreign Office, November 22, 1929.SECRET.CP. 324a (29).5116a   [20188]&apos;
