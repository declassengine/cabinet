IS DOCUMENT IS TUB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHHIO friAJESTY/1 S G-OVERUMEHT.CRET.P. 317 (29)CABINET,THE FACTORIES BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board ofTrade.At the meeting of the Cabinet on. the 20th November, It was decided that the inquiries of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research on the Cotton Industry should be taken into consideration in connection with the provisions in regard to the two-shift system.    I was not able to be present at a meeting of the Sub-Committee which was held on the 21st Hovember, but in my absence the First Lord of the Admiralty was good enough to consult the Sub-Committee, and I attach a copy of a letter which I have received from him on the subjectW.G. 22.11.29 .Board of Trade.
C OPY.-* Committee of Civil Research,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 21st November, 1929.My Dear Graham,In your absence, I informed the Sub-Committee on the Cotton Industry that His Majesty&apos;s Government have under consideration the question of shift systems in connection with the Factories Bill which they propose shortly to bring before Parliament; and I suggested that so far as they are in a position to do so on the evidence already received, the Sub-Committee should acquaint you with their provisional conclusions on this point.The Sub-Committee desire to take this opportunity of urging their view that so far as the cotton industry is concerned the time is not ripe for legislative changes in regard to the shift system.    It is evident to the Sub-Committee from the evidence received that both the employers and the operatives are more and more inclined to realise the need for changes in the present shift system, although the official position of the trade unions is adverse to double shifts.    The evidence of the leaders of the employers and operatives clearly xends to show that such changes will be needed to meet the situation caused by any introduction on an extensive scale of automatic machinery and by the present conditions of world competition.The Sub-Committee advise you as President of the Board of Trade that it would be best that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take no steps by legislation or otherwise which would seriously increase the difficulty of development on these lines.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) A.V. Alexander.fPne Rt.Hon,W.Graham, M. P.,I    President of the Board of Trade.
