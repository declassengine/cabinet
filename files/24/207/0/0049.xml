War Memorials and official participation in all such ceremonies abroad.   It would he proposed to make November 11th, 1928, the tenth Anniversary of the Armistice, the last occasion for such participation.   We agree that probably the only obstacle in the way of this suggestion is a natural diffidence on everyone5s part about putting it forward and we think that this country should take the initiative now and propose through diplomatic channels that a definite agreement on these lines should be reached between all the allied and associated countries.ALB ORH.
