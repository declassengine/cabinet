November 1929.VERY CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 312 (29).Memorandum respecting the Conversations between the Prime Minister and President Hoover at Washington(October 4 to 10, 1929).[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister.]A FULL report is being furnished by His Majesty&apos;s Embassy on the public side of my visit to the United States, i.e., the entertainments, speeches, public welcome, &amp;c. In this memorandum I am therefore proposing merely to record the gist of my conversations with the President and the Secretary of State.The President was anxious that the first conversations should take place as quietly and as informally as possible, and had therefore arranged that I should proceed to his &apos;&apos; camp &apos;&apos; on- the Rapidan River, in the Blue Ridge Mountains, on Saturday, the 5th October, i.e., the day after my arrival at Washington. The President and I left Washington by motor car after lunch, arriving at the camp some three hours later. The other members of the party consisted of Mrs. Hoover, Miss MacDonald, Colonel Stimson, Sir Robert Vansittart, Mr. Craigie, and members of the Presidents personal staff. The President and I drove out alone and reviewed the position. It was then that debts were mentioned, and the President said that the Balfour note, even if the road were otherwise clear, made it futile for him to grant any concessions.The &quot; close up &quot; conversations started in the morning of Sunday, the 6th October, and, with one break for a walk, continued all day. Besides the President and myself, the Secretary of State, Sir Robert Vansittart and Mr. Craigie were present throughout. In the course of the morning Colonel Stimson sent for the Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Cotton, who arrived after lunch. Our talks were throughout friendly, informal, and necessarily rather discursive, and all present participated in them, but for the sake of brevity and clearness I have placed the arguments advanced by both sides in the mouths of the President and myself only.I propose to deal in -separate sections with each point discussed at Rapidan, and then to add to each section a note on any subsequent discussions after my return to Washington.I.-NAVAL QUESTION.We covered the whole field in a full and frank discussion, and endeavoured to eliminate all points that seemed likely to divide us at the Five-Power Conference.Battleships.I outlined our proposals, namely, reduction of maximum displacement of units of 35,000 tons to 25,000 tons, reduction of gun calibre from 16 inches to 12 inches, and increase of age from 20 to 26 years. The President said that the United States did not wish to construct any more battleships before 1936, because many5102   [20107] copy No.36
naval officers believed that the days of the battleship were numbered owing to the development of aircraft, and he saw no point in putting vast sums into engines of war which might afterwards have to be scrapped as useless. In reply to my -objection that a building holiday up to 1936 would lead to dislocation in the yards, to a sudden spurt of building after 1936, and to the retention in our fleet of vessels over 30 years of age, Mr. Hoover declared that he did not wish to replace these ships at all when they became too old for use; would we not be prepared to reduce the number of battleships specified in the Washington Treaty ? I replied that my naval advisers were, I believed, opposed to any reduction in the number of battleships, and again urged the advantages of reducing the size of replacement ships. I pointed out that by extending the age limit we should be ipso facto reducing the number of replacements before 1936.In subsequent conversations at the State Department, Mr. Craigie discovered that the United States might in the last resort be induced to accept our proposal for a reduction to 25,000 tons, provided that they were first allowed to build one 35,000-ton ship to compensate them for our possession of the &quot; Hood &quot; (41,000 tons) and the &quot; Nelson &quot; and &quot; Rodney &quot; (35,000 tons each). In other words, the Navy Board would undoubtedly refuse to come down to 25,000 tons for future ships as long as they felt that we had a decided advantage in the size of existing battleships. As regards the 16-inch gun, the State Department feared that the Navy Board would be adamant, as they considered that the possession of this gun gave them a valuable advantage over the navies of third Powers.The above shows, I think, that elements favourable to a compromise are present and that there is no likelihood of any serious divergence between the two Powers in regard to this category of ship when the Five-Power Conference meets.Cruisers.We proceeded to discuss the cruiser problem in all its aspects and one new point of some importance emerged : the President had found that it was easier to bring the Navy Board to extend the yardstick in our favour by the use of the age factor than by the use of any other factor, and anything we could do by way of retaining one or two more of our older cruisers after 1936 would, he observed, greatly assist in bridging the gap represented by the 30,000 tons of 8-inch tonnage. For every 6-inch gun cruiser that we retained of 20 years&apos; service and over it would be possible for the United States to allow a very considerable discount in our favour a discount of 50 per cent, being mentioned during the conversations. Mr. Hoover hoped that, in view of our great need of cruisers for purely &quot;police&quot; functions we might still find it possible to retain a larger number of older cruisers for &quot;police&quot; purposes.The President appeared as anxious as Ave were to get the American figure for 8-inch cruisers down to 18, but saw no way of doing this as long as we insisted on 339,000 tons of cruiser tonnage and a replacement programme of 14 ships. At the beginning of our conversation on this point Mr. Hoover took up the line that it would be impossible for him to get any further concession out of His Navy Board, but I gradually brought him to see that there could be no question at all of the gap being-bridged simply by concessions on our part. At the end of our full and frank discussion, the President made it clear that he would meet us at least half way if we, on our side, could devise some means of helping in the elimination of this 30,000 tons. I should like to say here that the making of any substantial concession from the United States towards bridging the gap will depend mainly on the personal influence of the President, and the degree of pressure which he will exercise in this direction must depend in turn on his being kept in the frame of mind in which he was when we left Washington. Any refusal to discuss at the appropriate time such questions as belligerent rights at sea and naval stations would have been seriously detrimental to our arriving ultimately at a full agreement with the United States at the Five-Power Conference.It was decided that both sides should continue to examine Avays and means by AAmich this remaining gap might be bridged. We both realised that, even if a full agreement on the cruiser question were possible at this stage, its announcement Avould further arouse the sensibilities of other PoAvers. It Avas, in fact, desirable to retain a certain elasticity.
Destroyers.The President welcomed -my assurance that we would be prepared to come down to 150,000 tons of destroyer tonnage if the submarine fleet of other Powers were to be sufficiently reduced to make this possible. This figure would, he said, be acceptable to the United States. I warned him that if the French insisted on retaining the 90,000 tons of submarine tonnage now projected, our Admiralty considered it would be necessary to raise our destroyer tonnage to 200,000.Submarines.The United States would be prepared to come down to our present tonnage of 50,000 tons. It was subsequently stated at the State Department that the United States would have no objection to Japan retaining 70,000 tons of submarines if she wished, and a concession to Japan on this point might be held in reserve to help us over the cruiser difficulty.Aircraft Cruisers.It was suggested at the State Department, after our return to Washington, that our Admiralty might be disposed to consider the reduction of the total tonnage for aircraft cruisers in the Washington Treaty from 135,000 tons to, say, 120,000 tons. The maximum unit displacement at present stood at 25,000, and it was further suggested at the State Department that a minimum unit displacement for these vessels should also be fixed so as to prevent them from dropping down into the cruiser class and so disturbing the delicate adjustments which we are endeavouring to secure.Ten per Cent. Transfer between Categories.The United States Government would be quite agreeable to this, though they thought the French would probably ask for more than 10 per cent. The transfer would have to be arranged in such a way us not to disturb the adjustments made to secure parity.Japanese Delegates to the Conference.In order to allay Japanese suspicions and to try to compose outstanding-differences, the President said he was anxious to invite one or more of the Japanese delegates to come to Washington on the way to London, provided we saw no objection.   I said that there could be no possible objection to the course proposed.II. RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES AT SEA IN TIME OF WAR.The President drew attention to the view widely held in the United States that good relations between the two countries could never be fully established until the problems associated with the capture of property at sea in time of war had been squarely faced. One of the most prominent supporters of this theory was Senator Borah, who remained of the opinion that the question of &quot; the freedom of the seas &quot; should be tackled before the conclusion of an agreement on naval disarmament. Mr. Hoover hinted, although he did not say it in so many words, that Mr. Borah&apos;s support was necessary (and there is little doubt that this is so) to enable any reasonable agreement on naval disarmament to pass through the Senate, and that, to secure this support, some approach to the subject of maritime rights would have to be made. Furthermore, the Naval Construction Act contained a clause inviting the President to negotiate treaties on this subject with other Powers before the meeting of the Naval Conference which, under the Washington Naval Treaty, was to be held in 1931. This conference was now to be held in January 1930 instead of August 1931. Mr. Hoover admitted that this provision in the Act was not mandatory upon him nevertheless, he could not possibly afford to ignore it altogether. It was clear that the President and the Secretary of State realised the dangers and difficulties surrounding this question, but they felt impelled[20107] b 2
to suggest that the whole matter should be examined by a body of jurists representative of the important Naval Powers, who should conduct a thorough enquiry and report their views as to any &quot;possible or constructive&quot; method of -reaching a settlement. Mr. Hoover then developed at some length his scheme that, as part of such a settlement, ships laden exclusively with food supplies should be declared immune from capture in time of war and thus placed in the same category as^ hospital ships or ships carrying medical supplies. This idea has long been in his mind, and is the direct outcome of his own experiences and activities during the war. The importance of this psychological factor may be noted in passing.&apos;Seeing that the conservation of the food supplies of the United Kingdom in time of war was one of the principal preoccupations of every British Government, the President suggested that a general treaty prohibiting the capture of food supplies should prove to be of great value to us and should assist the progress of naval disarmament.In reply, I drew attention to the risks involved in raising this question, particularly before the naval question had been safely got out of the way. A committee appointed by the late Government had been examining the whole subject, and had found it replete with dangers and complexities of every sort. To touch it nOw might mean sacrificing much that had recently been achieved in other directions. As regards the food-ships scheme, I said I would be quite prepared to look into it carefully, but I warned him that, judging by the information at present available, some at least of my advisers at home were likely to be opposed to it, on the ground that the cutting off of food supplies had long been regarded as a perfectly legitimate and a very powerful method of applying naval pressure. The application of this method of pressure might prove one day to be a necessary part of the measures to be taken by the Powers of the world against a Power or Powers guilty of going to war in defiance of the Kellogg Pact. Furthermore, even if a practicable method could be found of safeguarding foodships from attack from the air while in port  of which I was by no means sure there remained the difficulty that such a treaty would presumably have no guarantee behind it. In other words, a treaty breaker would not apparently be subject to any international sanction. Lastly, the question of an apparent conflict with Article 16 of the Covenant of the League would have to be considered.Mr. Hoover declared that it was very unlikely that the world would ever agree to another food blockade, whatever the provocation offered. Moreover, even after the conclusion of such a treaty, signatory States would remain free to close their frontiers to the export of food-stuffs to an outlaw State. As regards attack from the air while the food-ship was in a port of one of the belligerents, this could be overcome by assigning certain ports or sections of ports to the handling of food-ships only, and the ships would, of course, have a distinctive marking in the same way as hospital ships. On the point of a guarantee Mr. Hoover was only able to say that it was not reasonable to suppose that the United States, having itself taken the initiative in securing the conclusion of such a Treaty, would stand aside and watch the violation with indifference. Finally, Mr. Hoover hinted that the con-clusion of a Treaty rendering food-ships immune from capture would probably make it unnecessary to proceed any further into this complex problem of the rights of neutrals and belligerents. This, I think, is also certainly in the minds of the Secretary of State and his department.As the President was keenly insistent on the food-ships proposal, i give his arguments fully so that the Cabinet may be aware of them. They are expressed in the following memorandum communicated to me privately and unofficially before I left Washington :-&quot; The President has made the informal suggestion that food-ships should be made free of any interference in times of war, thus removing starvation of women and children from the weapons of warfare and decreasing the necessity &quot;&apos;&quot; for naval arms for protection of the overseas lanes of food supplies. His suggestion would place all vessels laden solely with food supplies on the same footing as hospital ships.&quot;He expressed the view that the rapid growth of industrial civilisation during the past half-century has created in many countries populations far in excess of their domestic food supply, and thus steadily weakened their natural defences. As a consequence, protection for overseas supplies has been one of the impelling causes of increasing naval armaments and military alliances. Again, in countries which produce surplus food, their economic stability is also to a
considerable degree dependent upon keeping open the avenues of their trade in the export of such surplus, and this again stimulates armament on their part to protect such outlets. Thus, the fear of an interruption in seaborne food supplies has powerfully tended towards naval development in. both importing and exporting nations. And in all important wars of recent years to cut off or to protect such supplies has formed a large element in the strategy of all combatants. He expressed the belief that the world must sooner or later realise this a^ one of the underlying causes of its armed situation. And, further, that steps should be taken that starvation should not be included among the weapons of warfare. He felt that definite organisation under neutral auspices for protection of food movements in time of war would constitute a most important contribution to the rights of parties, whether neutrals or belligerents, and would greatly tend toward lessening the pressure for naval strength.&quot; The President recognises that such a suggestion could become practicable only by world-wide revision of existing treaties and the international understandings among many nations, and only after further realignment of world thought which should flow from the Paris Peace Pact.&quot;Seeing that the President and his Administration were evidently of opinion that the question of the freedom of the seas must now be raised in one form or another, and that, if we adopted a non possumus attitude, we should shortly be faced with the summoning of an international conference or commission of jurists, I acted on the recommendation in Section 70, paragraphs (i), (j) and (k), of the Belligerent Rights Committee&apos;s Report of the 6th March, 1929, to the effect that, should the raising of this question prove inevitable, an endeavour should be made to enter into preliminary private conversations on the subject with the United States Government. For convenience of reference I quote these paragraphs below : &quot; (i.) Finally, rather than take part in an International Conference, we should be prepared to enter into a Treaty with the United States on the basis of their existing Naval Instructions.(j.) If an International Conference should prove unavoidable, a Conference composed of the five great Naval Powers would be preferable.(Jo.) In either event, an endeavour should be made to enter into private and confidential conversations with the United States Government in the hope of harmonising beforehand, as far as possible, the views of the two Governments. In any case, it should be made clear to the United States Government that this country will refuse to enter upon any negotiations or Conference having for their object a revision as opposed to a recodification of maritime law.&quot;In pursuance of this recommendation I said I was quite prepared to go into the whole subject carefully when I returned home, but that, if the matters were to be discussed internationally, the right method would be to begin by preliminary and informal discussions between our two Governments on the lines of the recent naval conversations. Even such discussions should be postponed at least until after the Five-Power Naval Conference. After some hesitation, Mr. Hoover agreed on the first point, though he added that separate conversations on this subject between the United States, and Great Britain were likely to arouse suspicious criticism in many quarters, both in the United States and abroad. He agreed that actual discussions might be postponed until after the Five-Power Conference, but declared that, if he was to carry with him Senator Borah and others who shared the Senator&apos;s views and it should be clearly realised that relations are at all points strained between the President and the Senator, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations it was important to issue a statement during my visit to the effect that -we were ready to discuss this question at the appropriate time.We accordingly drafted a formula for communication to the press, which.was conveyed to the Foreign Office in Sir E. Howard&apos;s telegram No. 493 of the 6th October (Appendix A (1)). I should have preferred that Mr. Hoovers plan for the immunity of the food-ship should not have emerged at that moment, but he was evidently quite determined to put it forward at some early date, and. it was obvious that if I objected to its appearing in any form in our proposed communique there was a.danger of its being issued in a more.objectionable form after I had left the United States. This formula merely committed us to examine fully and frankly the question of &quot;rights and immunities at sea during war.&quot; It committed us to nothing at all so far as the food ship plan was concerned.   To have refused to go
even so far as this would have meant greatly increasing the hsk of the President&apos;s-reverting to the idea of a general International Conference on the subject at large.In view of the strong exception taken by some of my colleagues and by the Chiefs of Staff to the formula as drafted, I succeeded subsequently in securing Mr. Hoover&apos;s reluctant assent to the elimination of his unilateral statement in regard to food-ships. But this did not entirely satisfy my colleagues, and, on receipt of a telephonic advice of the purport of Foreign Office telegram No. 515 of the 9th October (see Appendix A (2)), which was on its way, I decided to inform the President that, after consulting my Cabinet, I had reached the conclusion that it would be very inadvisable for any overt reference to this subject to be made in our joint communique. I repeated my promise to go into the whole subject on my return to London, and said I would be prepared, after this preliminary examination had been completed, to discuss the matter informally with the United States Government.Mr. Hoover and Colonel Stimson were clearly chagrined and disappointed by this decision. They pointed out, with considerable force, that the fact of this question having been discussed was bound to leak out, since we could not issue any categorical denial to the questions which would inevitably be asked. We should, so to speak, be missing the great advantage of making a joint announcement at the present most favourable psychological moment without in any way modifying the position or altering the course of subsequent events. They recognised, however, the difficulty of my position at such a distance from home and eventually agreed, with a reasonably good grace, to the omission of any specific reference to the maritime rights issue. The text of the communique as finally issued is annexed as Appendix B.I notice in the telegrams from London that reference is made more than once to an understanding that this question of the rights of belligerents at sea would not be discussed during my stay at Washington. I am not aware of any such under-standing so far as the United States Government are concerned, nor would the ruling out of this question in advance have been in accord with the spirit of frank and free discussion which was to characterise my visit to the United States. It is true that I had no intention of raising this issue myself, and that I had no notice that it would be raised, but there was no obligation on the President not to raise it nor could I possibly have refused to listen to what he had to say on the subject. I was unprepared to discuss this thorny subject in any detail, nor was this proposed either by Mr. Hoover or Colonel Stimson. But, once I discovered that the United States Government felt bound to raise it in some form, the best course was clearly that recommended by the Belligerent Bights Committee, namely, to restrict discussion as far as possible to a preliminary exchange of views between the two Governments. I sympathise with my colleagues in having had to face this complex subject at such short notice, and I fully recognise their difficulty in agreeing within the time available to the issue of a communique which, in other circumstances, would have been psychologically, politically and diplomatically desirable, and which would, in point of fact, have made little change in a situation that must in any case be faced. It is now common knowledge that this issue was raised during the Washington conversa-tions, and will shortly emerge again in one form or another. Rightly or wrongly the question has in the United States come to be closely associated with the question of naval disarmament, and it is useless for us to proceed as if no such association did in fact exist. The issue must now be faced, and our best course is so to arrange matters that we face it under conditions as favourable as possible to ourselves.III. BRITISH NAVAL STATIONS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.In introducing this subject the President observed that our naval stations in proximity to the United States had been made the pretext for a good deal of hostile propaganda against the idea of a naval agreement with the British Empire. Those who were opposed to an understanding alleged that the possession of these naval stations gave to the Empire a great strategical advantage of which account should be taken in any naval agreement, and the reiteration of this view by those favouring a big American navy had undoubtedly had its effect in the country as a whole. No responsible authority in the United States regarded these stations as a real menace to the United States, but there was a great deal of misapprehension on the subject in the popular mind, and the chances of a satisfactory agreement on the na,val question would undoubtedly be improved if this controversy surrounding those naval stations could be stilled once for all.   Mr. Hoover said that, if His Majesty&apos;?
Government would be prepared to declare that Great Britain had no intention of causing her stations in the Western Hemisphere to be a menace to the United States, the United States Government would make a similar declaration in regard to their stations in the Eastern Hemisphere. Mr. Hoover admitted frankly that this quid pro quo would be of little use to us, except as a matter of form, because the United States had only one naval station in the Eastern Hemisphere, namely, Corregidor, in the Philippines, and this was already covered by article 19 of the Treaty of 1922 for the Limitation of Naval Armament. He hoped that, nevertheless, we would consider the matter carefully.I replied that our naval stations at Bermuda and in the Caribbean were only fortified to the extent necessary to defend them against raiders or a weak force, and could not by any flight of the imagination be regarded as a menace to the United States. Nevertheless, I took note of what the President had said about the use which was being made of the existence of these stations by those who were opposed to a naval agreement. We had, of course, no intention of so modifying the existing fortifications or establishments as to turn them into a menace to the United States, and I did not believe there could be any serious objection to placing this absence of intention on record. But I thought that we ought to begin with a definite statement from the American side that these stations were not regarded at present as a menace by the Government of the United States. Mr. Hoover promised to secure a statement to this effect from the United States Navy Board, though he added somewhat grimly that this would probably be no easy task. He proved, indeed, to be right, and several days of wrestling were necessary to extract from them a grudging admission that Bermuda and Jamaica constituted &quot;no appreciable menace z&apos; to the United States. This incident illustrates the mentality with which the President and the Secretary of State have to cope.When the question of Halifax was mentioned, I said that this was a matter for the Canadian Government, and I could not anticipate at all what their view would be. The Caribbean and the Canadian naval stations seemed to me to be in quite separate categories, and the difficulty as regards the latter appeared to be that Canada might reasonably expect some corresponding declaration from the American side in regard to naval stations in the United States in proximity to the Canadian-United States frontier. On this latter point, it was intimated to me that there was little prospect of any declaration being forthcoming in regard to United States naval stations in the Western Hemisphere.A formula was accordingly drafted which limited the scope of the declaration to the naval stations of Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere and to those of the United States in the Eastern Hemisphere. This formula was transmitted to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Sir E. Howard&apos;s telegram No. 493 of the 6th October (Appendix A (1)). It was subsequently modified in an endeavour to take account of objections raised by the Chiefs of Staff in Mr. Henderson&apos;s telegram No. 505 of the 8th October (Appendix A (5)), but, as the Chiefs of Staff still appeared to be opposed to any public declaration. I decided that the matter must wait over until I had returned to London and had had an opportunity of explaining more fully to my colleagues than was possible by telegram the purpose and scope of what was proposed.As in the case of the maritime rights, so in the case of the naval stations question, Mr. Hoover was greatly disappointed that no public declaration could be made on this subject at the termination of my visit to Washington. Psychologically speaking, an opportunity for producing the maximum of effect in the United States has been missed. Nevertheless, the wording of the formula was clearlv a matter which required care and deliberation, and I came to the conclusion that, on balance, the greater advantage lay in postponing the matter until I had been able to consult more fully with my colleagues and the Chiefs of Staff.IV.-CO-OPERATIVE ACTION FOR THE REINFORCEMENT of world PEACE.President Hoover introduced the above subject at an early stage in our proceedings at Rapidan. Instancing the recent examples of the Bolivia-Paraguay and the Russo-Chinese disputes, he observed that efforts by other Powers to intervene in such disputes in order to prevent their assuming serious proportions or in order
sto circumscribe the area affected were usually regarded by the disputants as an * unwarranted interference. Some further machinery was needed to give the more pacific Powers a locus standi for exercising a restraining influence on their more unruly neighbours. Although he did not say so, I think President Hoover had particularly in mind States which either did not belong to the League of Nations or which, if belonging, were for one reason or another less subject to League influence than are the majority of European States. What was wanted, Mr. Hoover thought, was some means of &quot;reinforcing the machinery for the pacific settlement of controversies.&quot; To this end he suggested the addition to the Treaty for the Renunciation of War of a third article providing that, in the event of any controversy occurring in which a satisfactory settlement is not reached as the restilt of direct negotiation or of a recourse to arbitration, the matter should be investigated by a commission, to be selected by the parties to the controversy, composed of the parties themselves and of a number of impartial members. The function of this commission would be to examine all the facts concerning the controversy, to endeavour to conciliate the divergence of view and to publish the facts. The article would further provide that a suggestion made by States not parties to the dispute for the putting into force of the above procedure would not be considered as an unfriendly act. Mr. Hoover laid down the axiom an interesting one when proceeding from a President of the United States that all nations have a legitimate interest in the preservation of peace and that all are injured by a breach of the peace. The President maintained that his proposal differed from existing forms of conciliation machinery in that it provided an additional step a stage for voluntary action by the parties to the controversy in virtue of their acknowledgment of the new basis for international relations established by the Pact of Peace.I expressed great interest in this proposal, but pointed out that as it stood it would appear to conflict with the Covenant of the League. The matter was discussed at considerable length, but it became clear as the discussion proceeded that the Presidents advisers and especially Mr. Cotton, the Under-Secretary of State  were far from convinced that the people of the United States would be prepared to enter into so far-reaching an engagement at the present time. Mr. Cotton con-sidered that, in present circumstances, it would be difficult for the United States to undertake any obligation more binding than the form of &quot; consultation &quot; provided for in Article 22 of the Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament. Considerable difficulty was experienced in arriving at any agreed formula, and finally it was decided to leave it for each Government to consider Avhether any advance in the direction indicated could usefully be made at the present time and, if so, in what direction that advance should be.V. LIQUOR SMUGGLING.President Hoover and his advisers displayed great interest in the subject of co-operation for the prevention of liquor smuggling. The President is now heading a new drive for law-observance. He himself was mainly concerned to secure our assent to a project that has frequently been mooted before, namely, the prohibition to export liquor from the United Kingdom to any destination where its import is prohibited, and the imposition of sanctions on any person guilty of making a false declaration of destination. I informed the President that such a scheme would in the United Kingdom necessitate the introduction of legislation; that there was a great deal of feeling in my country against any ad hoc legislation which might have the effect of placing a burden upon the British taxpayer and a heavy responsibility upon the British customs officials for the enforcement of a law of a foreign State; and that any such Bill, if introduced, might not only provoke undesirable contrd-versy, but might well fail to pass at all. In practice no liquor was ever declared in the United Kingdom for export to the United States; liquor destined ultimately for the United States was always declared for some intermediate destination. Moreover, the changing of a destination while the goods were in transit Avas a perfectly normal practice in legitimate trade, and any interference Avith the practice necessarily interfered Avith all trade.Mr. Hoover here interposed to say that he only proposed that Ave should make it an offence to change destination in transit when the ultimate destination Avas a country in Avhich the import of the article concerned Avas prohibited; this could not interfere in any way Avith legitimate practices.   He added that possibly the United
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.I cannot conclude this memorandum without bearing testimony to the excep-tional cordiality of the welcome which I received everywhere in the United States. From the time of our landing in New York a note of real enthusiasm was struck which surpassed all anticipations, and nothing could have exceeded the evident desire of the President, his Cabinet, members of the Legislature and of the people who lined the routes to make the visit a real success. I think a word of gratitude is due here to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, who since 1924 has worked untiringly and with singular success to promote a better feeling in the United States towards the British Empire. There was, I believe, a spontaneous desire on the part of the vast majority of Americans to make of this visit the beginning of a new and better era in Anglo-American relations, which had been seriously impaired by the Anglo-French Naval Compromise of last summer.Nevertheless, the crystallisation in the United States of this sentiment in favour of a more understanding relationship between the English-speaking peoples has not been the only or even the principal result of this visit, as I view it. There are in power to-day as President and Secretary of State men who in character and outlook differ materially from their predecessors. The personal contacts which I have been able to establish with these American statesmen are likely to prove of the utmost value in the months immediately ahead of us. I believe that Mr. Hoover and Colonel Stimson desire to try the experiment of a close working understanding with this country not to serve any selfish or nationalistic purpose, but to promote the cause of world peace and disarmament. &quot; Active and practical goodwill&quot; has been the keynote of Mr. Hoover&apos;s references to the future of Anglo-American relations, and there is no doubt in my mind that he means what he says. But I should like to strike a note of warning. Mr. Hoover is friendly but critical. This he has indeed demonstrated on many occasions in the past, and it is always useful and informative to bear in mind his attitude during the controversy over the Stevenson rubber restriction scheme as illustrating his natural &quot; reaction &quot; in matters where he has strong personal views or feelings. He is not sentimentally pro-British, but rather 120107 1 r9 .. .........States could assist us in return by taking particularly strict measures to stop the export of drugs from the United States to Great Britain.I assured the President that I was anxious to help in this matter in any practicable way as we had no desire at home to be placed in the invidious position of defending the bootlegger. I promised to go into the whole question on my return with the utmost desire to give such further assistance as could reasonably be expected of us. My feeling was, however, that more could be done by developing, where possible, the administrative measures which we already took to assist the United States than by the actual introduction into the British Parliament of aid hoc legislation. The President finally suggested that an American Commission, constituted like the Andrews Commission, of July 1926, should be sent to London to discuss with us ways and means of improving the present situation. But I urged that no definite decision in regard to procedure should be taken until after we had returned home and had had time to ascertain what further action, if any, it would be possible for us to take.The conversation then turned to the position as between Canada and the United States, and it soon became clear that the President and Secretary of State set much greater store on steps being taken by Canada to prohibit the export of liquor to the United States than on similar steps being taken in this country. The position on the Canadian border was seriously preoccupying the American authorities, and, as I was on the point of visiting Canada, Mr. Hoover explained some of the difficulties in case I should have an opportunity of discussing them with Mr. Mackenzie King when I saw him. This I gladly agreed to do, and-Mr. Hoover caused a statement summarising his views to be communicated to me before I left Washington. A copy of this forms Appendix C to the present memorandum.On my instructions Mr. Craigie also discussed with the &quot;State Department in some detail the working of the Treaty of 1924 for the suppression of liquor smuggling, the effect of the administrative measures now being taken in the Bahamas and elsewhere to assist the United States in its efforts to prevent the smuggling of liquor, and the steps, if any, which we could take to render further assistance in this matter.
is desirous, as a practical man, to work for the general good of the world with the country which he thinks he understands best, and with whose policies he finds himself more often than not in agreement. He is also, I think, at heart desirous of liquidat-ing all foreign difficulties, in order to concentrate on internal policy and development. This is a policy which we can scarcely fail to welcome, not only in the more narrow orbit of our direct relations with the United States, but in the wider sphere of our relationship with Europe and with the countries of the Far East. If we now return Mr. Hoover&apos;s good intentions into his bosom, if we receive suggestions of his in a carping spirit, and particularly suggestions having an internal repercussion (e.g., his suggestion for immunity of food ships, having regard to his troubles with Senator Borah, who is far more extreme on the subject), I greatly fear the effects upon the President. The real and truly rather unexpected improvement over the last Administration in every line and branch is likely to be lost. The question now is whether we are going to welcome the prospect that is offered to us in a wide and generous spirit, or whether, by adopting a purely traditional attitude towards problems which have lost much of the significance of former years, we are going to risk the loss of a mighty accretion to our security and prestige in the years to come.(Signed) J. RAMSAY MACDONALD.

FOLLOWING from the Prime Minister :-&quot; It is proposed to issue from the White House on Wednesday evening, for publication on Thursday morning, a statement outlining range of subjects touched upon during prolonged interchange of views which has taken place at the Presidents camp to-day. Amongst points to be mentioned in the statement are the following : &quot; Naval Stations.&quot; &apos; With a further view to reducing fear and the friction that comes from fear we have obtained opinion of our general Board of the Navy that the existing military and naval stations of Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere are not in a condition to be a menace to the United States. Great Britain will not here-after establish any military or naval stations in her possessions in the Western Hemisphere, nor alter any such existing stations in such a way as in either case to become a menace to the United States.&quot; &apos; Reciprocally, United States makes the same agreement as to Eastern Hemisphere. It is understood, however, by both parties that the above declaration does not alter or supersede the provisions of article 19 of the Washington treaty of 1922 for the limitation of naval armament.&quot; &apos; Such Western Hemisphere is to be defined as that portion of the globe lying west of 30 meridian and east of the 170 meridian, and Eastern Hemisphere as remainder of the globe.&apos;&quot; Rights and Immunities at Sea.&quot; &apos; We recognise that some of the most troublesome questions in inter-national relations are those arising out of rights and immunities at sea during war.&quot; 1 Controversies and disputes engendered by this subject have in the past been pregnant with the danger of aggravating or extending hostilities. Misunderstandings and fears arising from this source have been frequent but, we believe, an avoidable cause of friction between our two countries. We have resolved, therefore, that we will examine this question fully and frankly.&quot; &apos; The President hopes that food-ships will be declared free from inter-ference in time of war, thus removing starvation of women and children from the weapons of warfare and reducing the necessity for naval arms for the protection of avenues of food supplies. Such a proposal would protect all vessels laden solely with food supplies in the same fashion as hospital ships are now protected.&apos;&quot; I should be grateful for any observations you wish to offer on the above by Tuesday morning. A similar request has been addressed to Canadian Government.&quot; Please inform other Dominion Governments. &quot; I will send further explanatory telegram to-morrow.&quot;(Repeated to Ottawa.)

We hope, however, to despatch reply to-morrow&apos; morning.&quot;No. 3.Sir E. Howard to Mr. A. Henderson. (Received October 8, 8-45 a.m.)Washington, October 7, 1929. (No. 495.   State.   Very Confidential.) [October 7, 1 -35 p.m.)MY telegrams Nos. 493 and 494. Following from Sir R. Vansittart: &quot; President is most anxious to make declarations in this sense in view of propaganda against a naval settlement which is expected to be based largely on naval base and freedom of the seas issues. The wording of the declarations is, of course, more suitable for a public statement to the press than for a formal agreement, but we hope that no change in the wording will be made except where it is considered essential. We objected to the words Starvation of women and children,&apos; but realised that it would be well not to persist too far &quot;.; at that stage. My impression is that if objection were raised at your end some modification might be secured.&quot;It will be realised that once the question of freedom of the seas (the expression originally used which we eliminated) had been raised, conversations between ourselves only was the best we could hope to secure, and was, indeed, the objective outlined in Belligerent Rights Committee&apos;s report.&quot; With regard to third paragraph, we believe that if idea of an under-standing in regard to food-ships Were to prove acceptable it may be possible to rest content with this and so prevent any further incursion into this dangerous field. It was clearly stated by both President and the Secretary of State that passage beginning &apos; and reducing the necessity &apos; was not intended to be used and Would not be used by them as a plea for reduction of cruiser strength.&quot; We much hope there will be no difficulty about naval stations, as declaration, while not altering status quo, will be most valuable here. We hope to issue at the same time a very satisfactory statement as to general course of conversations on the naval question.&quot;No. 4.Mr. A. Henderson to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No. 504.)   K. Foreign Office, October 8, 1929.YOUR telegrams Nos. 493, 494 and 495.My two immediately following telegrams contain considered views of Chiefs of Staffs and of Foreign Office upon the points raised in your telegrams under reference.Also see my telegram No. 507.
- 4 9ISHtft-No. 6.Mr. A. Henderson to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No. 506.   State.) Foreign Office, October 8, 1929, 4 p.m.MY telegram No. 504 of 8th October : Naval disarmament.If it is necessary from Presidents point of view that some reference to belligerent rights should be made, Foreign Office would regard two paragraphs beginning &apos;&apos; we recognise &apos;&apos; and ending &apos;&apos; fully and frankly &apos;&apos; as comparatively harmless, provided that first paragraph, like second, could be made to refer to the past and that some reference should be made to the new situation created by the Peace Pact. Please see in this connexion paragraph 64 of C.I.D. Paper 944-B, of which Craigie has copy.[20107] dMr. 4. Henderson to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No. 505.   State.) Foreign Office, October 8, 1929^ 2-50 p.m.MY immediately preceding telegram.The Chiefs of Staff met this morning to consider your telegrams Nos. 493 and 494.They agree with the General Navy Board of the United States that existing military and naval stations of Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere are not in a condition to be a menace to the United States, and this view is one that has often been expressed by them.As regards the future of such naval stations in the Western Hemisphere, they advise most strongly against any mention being included in the proposed statement that could be construed as implying our readiness to enter into an agreement which would potentially restrict our freedom of action in our own possessions whilst imposing no parallel obligation on the United States, for the reason that that country has no such possessions in the Eastern Hemisphere except the Philippines covered by the Washington Treaty.It must be realised that our garrisons in Bermuda and the West Indies have been (for financial reasons) deliberately ^dlowed to fall below a figure which would even admit of their manning the existing armament. Any undertaking which might preclude our bringing these garrisons up to their proper strengths again, if and when we desire to do so, would be a dangerous precedent. Our establishments in Bermuda and the West Indies are maintained quite irrespective of the United States in connexion with the general arrangements for trade protection. It is essential that, if the world situation changes, we should be free to re-establish the garrisons which are reduced to a nucleus and to bring the defences up to date. The proposed statement as worded does not cover Canadian naval establishments in Canada, but similar arguments would, in the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff, be applicable to them.As regards rights and immunities at sea, the Chiefs of Staff are of opinion that on a question of such vital importance to the Empire nothing whatever should appear in the statement to be issued which could be taken at this stage as being even the most partial surrender of our belligerent rights at sea.They invite attention to the reports of the recent enquiry by the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which Mr. Jones has copies. After exhaustive enquiry the main conclusions reached were that belligerent rights should be maintained as high as possible and that international discussion of the question should be avoided if possible.The Chiefs of Staff are seriously concerned at the prospect of any statement being made which might commit His Majesty&apos;s Government prematurely to a course of action in a grave matter of Imperial defence, and urge that you yourself should reserve judgment until this most complicated and controversial subject has been re-examined by your Government, and the Dominions consulted.In any event, they beg that you will secure the omission from the statement of the passage suggesting exemption of food-stuffs from blockade. They would remind you that food-stuffs can Be converted into munitions of war.
The Presidents proposal about food ships, however, seems to involve con-siderable difficulty for members of the League of Nations. The proposal that a State which had gone to war in violation of the Covenant and the Pact of Peace should be entitled to import food-stuffs without interference from members of the League who were acting against such State in accordance with the Covenant seems impossible to reconcile with the text of article 16, which binds the members, inter alia, to prohibit all commercial intercourse between nationals of the Covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a member of the League or not. This obligation is not affected by the unratified amendment drawn up by the second, fifth and sixth Assemblies. Moreover, the resolutions adopted by the 1921 Assembly, while recognising that the cutting off of the food supplies of the civil population of the defaulting State should be regarded as an extremely drastic measure, nevertheless contemplated the possibility of its application if the other measures available were clearly inadequate, and also contemplated in special cir-cumstances the establishment of an effective blockade of the sea-board of the Covenant-breaking State, an operation which would obviously entail the stoppage of food cargoes bound for that sea-board. In view of this action by the Assembly reference to starvation of women and children seems particularly undesirable.Further, it would seem almost inevitable that if a Covenant-breaking State were to be assured of the power to import food from a non-League State it would be impossible to maintain the prohibition on League States to supply food to it themselves. It would be difficult for the Council of the League to recommend that the members of the League should cut off supplies to the Covenant-breaking State from their own countries if that State were receiving supplies from non-League States without interference.It appears, therefore, that the adoption of the Presidents proposal would have a very important effect upon the position of article 16, and it would seem difficult for us, as a member of the League, to commit ourselves to any such proposal in conversations with a non-League State without the question having been the subject of discussion between the members of the League at Geneva. The discussions of article 16 which have taken place at several Assemblies without any amendments to the article having been definitely adopted show how difficult and important the question is.We would further suggest that reference to two hemispheres is susceptible of misinterpretation by other Powers as an attempt on the part of Anglo-Saxon nations to divide the world between them. This applies particularly to France, which has possessions in both hemispheres. Furthermore, Italian press comment on Prime Minister&apos;s visit is already extremely bitter.No. 7. &apos;Mr. A.

[20107JSir E. Howard to Mr. A. Henderson. (Received October 9, 2-40 p.m.)Washington, October 8, 1929. . 499.-State.) (October 9, 3-55 a.m.)FOLLOWING from Sir B. Vansittart for Sir V. Wellesley :-&quot; (Very Confidential.)&quot;Your telegrams Nos. 503, 504, 505 and 506 have been helpful, and President has now been persuaded to withdraw personal declaration which he wished to make. But the vigour of your response to suggestion at the end of paragraph 1 of my telegram No. 495 has been such as to lead me to think there must be some misunderstanding, and that you supposed Prime Minister endorsed or agreed with declaration. This, of course, is not and has never been so. (He fully appreciated and made use of arguments in your telegram No. 506 respecting League of Nations; but as he was not committed by nor endorsing Presidents &apos; hope &apos; he could not do more than point out the difficulty.) He is sending a separate telegram to Mr. Snowden, but I should perhaps send this further telegram to amplify explanation of the situation. It is this. President has withdrawn now and reluctantly personal statement which we have, of course, no power to prevent eventually; and it is highly probable that he will make it eventually, by speech or otherwise, at no very distant date. (It is evidently much in his mind; firstly, I think it dates back to his personal experiences and activities during the war, and, secondly, from his point of view, it is a necessity vis-a-vis Borah, to whom I will refer later.) But it is also in his mind to stop at his food ships proposal and to go no farther on this subject. The situation and prospect have therefore to be faced. It has, indeed, long been expected with apprehension.&quot; With the elimination of his personal statement there remain first two paragraphs on this subject, beginning &apos; We recognise &apos; and ending &apos; frankly,&apos; of which amended text follows in separate telegram.&quot; If this is not included, whole naval agreement, of which prospects are now most satisfactory, will probably fail in the Senate owing to an anti-Administra-tion campaign led by Borah, who is, as you are aware, out to make so-called freedom of the seas precede naval agreement. (President does not wish to go into even his attenuated version till after the Five-Power Conference.) If this happens we may well within now measurable time find ourselves faced, after a short interval of calumny and bad relations, with a demand for a wide inter-national conference on wider issues than those now suggested. Prime Minister was, indeed, confronted with proposal for international conference, and it was only by great exertion that he narrowed proposed examination down to United States and Great Britain, thereby fulfilling paragraph 70 (k) of conclusions of Belligerent Rights Committee&apos;s second report. Therefore, paragraph separately telegraphed and amended to meet Foreign Office telegram No. 506 is probably a minimum for passage of naval agreement. Elimination of this mild residue may well involve failure of the whole policy. It looks like a case of sibylline books. I am sure Prime Minister would wish you to show this to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Acting Prime Minister.&quot;
No. 10.Mr. A. Henderson to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No. 514.  State.) Foreign Office, October 9, 1929, 12-20 p.m.FOLLOWING from Chancellor of Exchequer for Prime Minister : &quot; I have just received following message from Mr. Henderson : &quot; &apos; Mr. Henderson has read the whole of the telegrams, and associateshimself with the views expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as set forth in his last telegram.&quot; &apos; Mr. Henderson understood that the question of the freedom of the seaswas not to be part of the conversations for an agreement on naval disarmament,but had to be deferred until a later stage.Sir E. Howard to Mr. A. Henderson. (Received October 9, 11-15 a.m.)Washington, October 9, 1929. (Nos: 500 and 501.   State.) (October 9, 3-33 a.m.)MY immediately preceding telegram. Following from Sir R. Vansittart : &quot; Rights and Immunities at Sea.&quot; Wording of paragraph now proposed (which takes account of suggestions contained in your telegram No. 504) is as follows :  As regards the second point, we recognise that some of the most troublesome questions in our relations have been those which have arisen out of rights and immunities at sea during war. The controversies and disputes engendered by this have in the past been pregnant with the danger of aggravating and extending hostilities. Misunderstandings and fears springing from this source have been a frequent, but we believe avoidable, cause of friction between our two countries. We have resolved, therefore, in the light of the new situation created by the conclusion of Pact of Peace, that we shall examine the question fully and frankly together in all its bearings.&apos;&quot; In order to meet objections outlined in your telegram No. 505, we propose following wording to be substituted for previous wording: &quot; &apos; The General Board of the United States Navy have put their opinion on record that the existing military and naval stations of Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere are not in a condition to be an appreciable menace to the United States.&quot; &apos; Great Britain neither intends nor desires to modify this situation in such a way as to cause these stations to become such a menace. Any technical elaboration of this assurance which may be required will form the subject of subsequent examination.&apos;   (End of R.)&quot;United States. Government having spontaneously raised this point and extorted the grudging recognition contained in paragraph 1 from United.States Navy Board, refusal on our part to confirm an obvious and existing fact (i.e., that our stations are not intended to be a menace to the United States) would cause the worst impression here.&quot; You will appreciate great value to us of the admission made by Navy Board in paragraph 1. This agitation about the naval bases has proceeded for years and now arouses more widespread interest than ever. It will undoubtedly be utilised by those wishing to make any naval agreement impossible, and, once&apos; raised (if left unsettled), must necessarily tend to stiffen the official American attitude on naval and other questions.(R.) &quot; Aa regards Canada, please see telegram 217. It is proposed to make no mention of Canada in the declaration, but Prime Minister will discuss matter with Prime Minister of Canada when he reaches Ottawa.&quot;1
&quot;&apos; Mr. rienderson agrees that in the circumstances no further indications could have been given to the Prime Minister than those contained in the telegrams which have been despatched, but suggests that perhaps it might be expedient to tell the Prime Minister of the sympathy felt for him in the difficulty in which he has been placed by the fact of this awkward question having been raised at this moment/&quot; I associate myself warmly in expressing sympathy.&quot;No. 11.Mr. A. Henderson to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No. 515.   State.) Foreign Office, October 9, 1929, 5 15 p.m.^ FOLLOWING secret and personal for Prime Minister from Chancellor of the Exchequer : &apos;&quot;Your telegram No. 498.&quot;No one here supposed that you were endorsing the Presidents immunity t proposal, but we felt it would be fatal for one of the parties to the proposed examination to commit himself in advance to a proposition which challenges our historic attitude towards the question of rights and immunities at sea. The appearance of such a statement in what is practically a joint public announce-ment of what occurred at your conversations might well be interpreted to signify your tacit acquiescence in the proposal. In any event, the statement would load the dice against us at the later discussions, and would be calculated to arouse suspicion and anxiety in the public mind here, which might well prejudice the discussions even on disarmament. I gather, however, from telegram No. 500 that the Presidents proposal will be dropped from the statement, and we are greatly relieved.&apos;&apos; I should have preferred to avoid any international discussion of this question, as recommended by the Belligerent Rights Committee. I cannot see how our policy of the renunciation of war is to benefit from a possibly acrimonious discussion of one of war&apos;s remoter and more controversial problems. If, however, we cannot escape from the raising of this question, in spite of the risk of friction and ill-feeling involved, I agree that the plan you have adopted is the one open to the least objection. I hope, however, that the discussions may be deferred at least until after. the completion of the Disarmament Conference.&quot;No. 12.Mr. A. Henderson to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No. 516.   State.) Foreign Office, October 9, 1929, 5-30 p.m.YOUR telegrams Nos. 500 and 501 of 9th October : Naval disarmament.Committee of Chiefs of Staff suggest that, if the paragraph in the proposed statement beginning &apos;&apos; Great Britain neither intends nor desires &apos;&apos; is to be published, it should be made clear to the United States Government and placed on record that we interpret this to mean that, while we have no intention of doing anything that is a menace to the United States of America, we shall not be debarred from taking any action necessary for using these bases effectively in the near or distant future should this be required owing to our relations with some Power other than the United States of America.Mr. Snowden agrees.No. 13.Sir E.

 appendix B.Joint Statement by President Hoover and Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. (Published in the morning Papers of October 10, 1929.)AT the moment of leaving Washington the following joint statement was issued :  &quot; During the last few days we have had an opportunity, in the.informal talks in which we have engaged, not only to review the conversations on a naval agreement which have been carried on during this summer between us, but also to discuss some of the more important means by which the moral force of our countries can be exerted for peace.&quot; We have been guided by the double hope of settling our own differences on naval matters and so establishing unclouded goodwill, candour and confidence between us, and also of contributing something to the solution of the problem of peace in which all other nations are interested and which calls for their co-operation.&quot;In signing the Paris Peace Pact, fifty-six nations have declared that war shall not be used as an instrument of national policy. We have agreed that all disputes shall be settled by pacific means. Both our Governments resolve to accept the Peace Pact not only as a declaration of good intentions but as a positive obligation to direct national policy in accordance with its pledge.&quot;The part of each of our Governments in the promotion of world peace will be different, as one will never consent to become entangled in European diplomacy, and the other is resolved to pursue a policy of active co-operation with its European neighbours; but each of our Governments will direct its thoughts and influence towards securing and maintaining the peace of the world.&quot; Our conversations have been largely confined to the mutual relations of the two countries in the light of the situation created by the signing of the Peace Pact. Therefore, in a new and reinforced sense, the two Governments not only declare that war between them is unthinkable, but that distrusts and suspicions arising from doubts and fears which may have been justified before the Peace Pact must now cease to influence national policy. We approach old historical problems from a new angle and in a new atmosphere. On the assump-tion that war between us is banished, and that conflicts between our military or naval forces cannot take place, these problems have changed their meaning and character, and their solution, in ways satisfactory to both countries, has become possible.&quot;We have agreed that those questions should become the subject of active consideration between us. They involve important technical matters requiring detailed study. One of the hopeful results of the visit which is now terminating officially has been that our two Governments will begin conversations upon them following the same method as that which has been pursued during the summer in London.&quot; The exchange of views on naval reduction has brought the two nations so close to agreement that the obstacles in previous conferences arising out of Anglo-American disagreements seem now substantially removed. We have kept the nations which took part in the Washington Naval Conference of 1922 informed of the progress of our conversations, and we have now proposed to them that we should all meet together and try to come to a common agreement which would justify each in making substantial naval reductions. An agree-ment on naval armaments cannot be completed without the co-operation of other naval Powers, and both of us feel sure that, by the same free and candid discussion of needs which has characterised our conversations, such mutual understandings will be reached as will make naval agreement next January possible, and thus remove this serious obstacle to the progress of world disarmament.
&apos;&apos; Between now and the meeting of the proposed conference in January our Governments will continue conversations with the other Powers concerned, in order to remove as many difficulties as possible before the official and formal negotiations open.&quot; In view of the security afforded by the Peace Pact, we have been able to end, we twist for ever, all competitive building between ourselves, with the risk of war and the waste of public money involved, by agreeing to a parity of fleets, category by category.&quot; Success at the coming conference will result in a large decrease in the naval equipment of the world, and, what is equally important, the reduction of prospective programmes of construction which would otherwise produce com-petitive building to an indefinite amount.&quot; We hope and believe that the steps we have taken will be warmly welcomed by the people whom we represent as a substantial contribution to the efforts universally made by all nations to gain security for peace not by military organisation, but by peaceful means rooted in public opinion and enforced by a sense of justice in the civilised world.&quot;APPENDIX C.Statement of Mr. Hoover&apos;s Views on United States-Canadian Relations.October 9, 1929.THE United States is making the most notable effort in all history to suppress alcoholic beverages. This effort is one that is of profound importance to the whole of humanity, and the United States is pioneering it in certain directions, and is, therefore, doing service to all nations. It would appear that it should receive the sympathetic support of other nations, for, whether it succeeds or not, it will at least have exhausted some portion of the wide variety of methods for the remedy of a great human evil.We have had numerous conferences with Canadian authorities with respect to measures that could be taken fo assist in suppression of the flow of alcoholic beverages over the border. The Canadian authorities have co-operated to the extent of giving information to the American officials as to proposed shipments, and in other ways which have been most helpful. However, so long as the Canadian Government allows liquor to be cleared for American ports or allows their clearance for other ports when really destined for the United States, there will be a constant stream of Canadian liquor into the United States. It is not possible, on 3,000 miles of frontier, to erect sufficient border patrol to prevent it because the initiative is always in the hands of the smuggler.This movement of liquor is the source of constant friction between the two nations. Only desperate men of criminal type engage upon it. They are criminals under the laws of the. United States. They go armed, and often arm their ships. Such equipment is an indication of their intent to kill, and they have often killed the United States officers. It is impossible on our side to employ the type of men on border patrols who have knowledge of international law and delicacy in dealing with killers, and when, perchance, they execute their duty an inch over the line, they are the cause of an international incident. The sensational press envisages war with the British Empire whenever an American patrol boat fires on a Canadian bootlegger, or vice versa, and if, perchance, one of this criminal class should be killed or captured, he becomes an international celebrity. The diplomatic officers of Great Britain are placed in the difficult position of defending the rights of criminals. All this leads to constant and disagreeable irritation. The Canadian officials in contact with our officials in the past have insisted very frankly that the export of alcoholic beverages is an important item in Canadian trade. We realise there is no obligation upon Canada to trouble herself over our problems. We bear her no ill-will in the matter, for she is entirely within her rights in leaving it alone. The benefits to Canada by full co-operation with the United States to help in a social question would lie in better feeling in the United States, which would, I am sure, interpret itself in time into co-operation in other directions which would be of assistance to her.
There is no real solution to the problem unless the Canadian Government would undertake to prohibit shipment of all liquor to the United States. At the present time the great bulk of shipments (as per.my official information, 90 per cent.) are cleared directly for American ports. If the only shipments were upon false papers the traffic would greatly diminish, as the smuggler would thus be in conflict and in danger from the laws of both countries.Mr. Mackenzie King has recently taken an interest in the matter and expressed a desire to clear it up. The British Government also controls a certain amount of liquor flow into the United States through the West Indies, and some direct from British ports.   The question, therefore, involves Great Britain directly also.
