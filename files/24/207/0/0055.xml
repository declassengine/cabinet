9 9 Qtj O &amp;Is document is the property of His Britannia Ma,ieaty&apos;s Government).SECRET.C.P.364.(29) .CABINET.FACTORIES BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary,I circulate to my colleagues a further draft of the Factories Bill which has been revised in accordance with the decisions of the Cabinet.    - Subject to any further observations my colleagues may have to make, I propose to give notice to introduce the Bill next week.I should perhaps explain that, under the New Clause 72, which makes provision for the working of overtime, the sole purpose for which overtime is to be allowed in any industry or process is that of enabling pressure of work to be dealt with and then only when the extension of hours contemplated by the Clause is recognised by collective agreement or by an award as to wages and conditions or is authorised by order of the Secretary of State,     Moreover,  in view of sub-clause  (4) of Clause 156,  that the provision of the Factories Bill shall; be in addition to and not in substitution for or diminution of any other Act, there can be no question of the provisions of Clause 72    operating in derogation of the Hours of Employment Act.J .R .
