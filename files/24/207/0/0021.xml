A u immediate decision is necessary for, unless increased expenditure is to be incurred, this year&apos;s shipping arrangements and programme of reliefs must now be definitely completed.I attach in Appendices a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office and a statement of the strength of the foreign troops in China.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.-i -.-, mestion of the future garrisons in China was considered by the late Cabinet on 21st November, 1928, when the late Secretary of State for War mjip^ CP. 353 (28), expressed the view that the recent situation in China showed so much Movement thatPit was possible safely to effect a further reduction in our foi^e m thaPt country which would bring them down from 8 battalions(1 Indian): If the withdrawal of these two battalions was agreed to, the temporary distribution recommended was as follows : 2. The late Cabinet approved a reduction to 7 battalions (1 Indian), but could not agree to a reduction to 6 battalions (1 Indian) without the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking (Cabinet 52 (28), Conclusion 8). His Majesty&apos;s Minister was opposed to a reduction below 7 battalions (1 Indian), as he considered the political situation far too uncertain. Accordingly (in terms of infantry battalions only) the garrison has remained at 7 battalions (1 Indian) distributed as follows : T.S.The War Office,23rd November, 1929.Tientsin ... ShanghaiHong Kong2 British battalions.Tientsin ... ShanghaiHong Kong2 British battalions.(BJ9/17)   60   11/29   W.O.P.   4751
3. In spite of the recrudescence of civil war, in my opinion the situation in China has not during the past months constituted, and still does not constitute, a menace from the military point of view to either of the International Settlements of Shanghai and Tientsin, or to our Legation at Peking. Tentative arrangements were therefore made in the current trooping programme of reliefs to withdraw one British battalion from Hong Kong, leaving a garrison in China of 6 battalions (1 Indian) distributed as shown in paragraph 1 above. This is the number which has been recommended to the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Chiefs of Staff in their last Annual Review of Imperial Defence Policy as representing the minimum necessary for future requirements (C.I.D. paper 948-B, paragraph 19). This would leave available for the reinforcement of Shanghai, should any future situation arise which demands this step, one battalion from Hong Kong and one battalion from Tientsin, which could both be sent without unduly depleting the garrisons of both these places.4. The question of this reduction was referred to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking on 8th November (Foreign Office telegram No. 389), who, after consultation with his naval and military advisers, has expressed the view that it would be definitely dangerous to reduce further any of the garrison in China at the present time. Meanwhile, until this question is settled, one battalion in the United Kingdom is serving under the grave disadvantage of not knowing whether it will proceed, with its families, to Hong Kong on 10th January, 1930, or to Gibraltar on 4th February, 1930, and in consequence the shipping programme is held up.5. Apart from the fact that this battalion is being kept in an unnecessary state of uncertainty, a very early decision on this matter is essential, as the time has now arrived when the shipping arrangements for this year&apos;s programme of reliefs cannot be held in abeyance any longer.APPENDIX A.LETTER FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE DATED 19th NOVEMBER, 1929.Sir,I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to refer to War Office letter No. 083/5651 (M.O. l) of the 5th instant, relative to the strength of British military garrisons in China.2. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking, who was requested to telegraph his observations on the recommendation of the Army Council that the garrisons at Tientsin and Shanghai should remain as at present, but that the British battalion due to leave Hong Kong on the 25th February, 1930, should not be replaced, consulted the Commander-in-Chief in China who stated in reply that he considered it definitely dangerous to reduce further any of the garrison in China at the present time, as there appears to be great probability of the present Chinese Government falling in the near future and this may easily result in most disturbed conditions throughout the country with grave risk to British life and property. Sir M. Lampson agrees with the Commander-in-Chief, particularly since politically stormy times may result, whether the present Chinese Government falls or not, from the negotiations at present proceeding with the Chinese Government on the abolition of extra-territoriality and other questions.3. After careful consideration of the position Mr. Henderson feels that the time has not yet come for a reduction of British forces in the Far East and regrets, therefore, that he is unable to concur in the recommendations of the Army Council put forward in your letter under reply.i am, &amp;c,C. &quot;W.
