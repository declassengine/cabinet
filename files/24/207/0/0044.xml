This dooument is&apos;the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government)CP .353(29)S E 0 RET.CABINET.factories bill.OVERTIKE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary..At its meeting on the 30th October the Cabinet    Committee on the Factories Bill agreed to adjourn the discussion in regard to the overtime pro-visions of the Bill until after the Gabinet had examined the Draft Hours of Employment Bill.    In my memorandum of the 26th October  (reference F.B.0.(29) 2)  I had said that in view of the fact that at the present time overtime can be and is being worked by women and young persons in excess of the 48 hour week,  subject of course to the statutory maximum of 60 hours fixed by the Factory Act,  1901,  I wished to obtain the assent of my colleagues to the insertion of provisions in the Factories Bill, which would allow overtime to be worked in any factory without previous application to the Home Secretary, up to a total, on an average over the year of not more than two hours a week.    This proposal was in agreement with the conclusion at which I under-stood the Hours of Employment Bill Committee had arrived with regard to that Bill, namely    that some general provision for overtime in exceos of the standard 48 hours is desirable.Objection was taken to this proposal by some of my colleagues on the Factories Bill Committee on the ground that it would allow of systematic overtime being worked by an employer and result in the raising of the standard 48 hour week to a standard 50 hour- week.    It was also objected that it would not be in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Convention.
I understand that there is no prospect of a definite decision being come to with regard to the provisions of the Hours of Employment Bill for some weeks at the very earliest.        The conferences with the railway interests have not yet taken place and when the question of the railways has been disposed of there still remain the consultations with the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations and with the Council of the Trades Union Congress.    It will be very unfortunate in my opinion if the Factories Bill has to be held up until the various questions on the Hours Bill are settled.    I am constantly receiving inquiries and requests for deputations in connection with the Bill and it is most desirable that it should be introduced and be available for consideration by the interests affected at the earliest possible date.    As the Cabinet are aware the Bill will introduce extensive amendments Into the existing law and it is important that it should be before the country some time in advance of the Second Reading and Committee stages.In order to complete the preparation of the Factories Bill,  and to make it possible to introduce it at an early date, I submit the following suggestion,  as a provisional solution of the overtime difficulty,  for the consideration of my colleagues. I would modify the proposal I put before the Factories Bill Committee, In the following manner:-I would propose in the Bill as introduced to limit the right to work overtime to industries or processes in which overtime is recognised by a collective agreement between organisations representative of the employers and workers in the industry or process concerned,  or by an award as to wages or conditions of work in the industry or process, or in which overtime is sanctioned, by an Order of the Secretary of State, for the industry or process.      This limitation would I hope meet the objections taken by some of my colleagues on the Factories
Bill Committee, as under this proposal the overtime would no longer depend on the unrestricted discretion of the employer. The limit to he placed on the amount of overtime to be worked would be as already proposed, viz. an average taken over a year of    two&apos;&apos;hours a week,      The working of overtime would also be subject to the same  conditions as in the existing Act, namely that the employer would have to report to the Inspector and enter in a register at the factory particulars of the overtime, on each, occasion before working the overtime, and also to keep a notice of the overtime posted up in the factory.The advantage of this procedure would be that it would enable me to proceed with the introduction of the Bill and at the same time would leave the question of overtime open to further consideration at a later stage if the Cabinet should come to the decision on the Hours Bill that wider provisions in regard to overtime were required in view of the exigencies of industry.There will still be ample time for the    settlement of the questions on the Hours Bill before the second reading of the Factories Bill is taken,    and even when the Factories Bill gets into Committee it will be some time before the Hours Provisions of the Bill are reached. As the Cabinet are aware theHours Provisions of the Factories Bill form only one out. of a dozen Chapters of the Bill:  there is a great deal of work lying before the Standing Committee in the consideration of the earlier parts of the Bill, and it would always be possible,  if it seemed necessary, to postpone the consideration of the overtime provisions to a later stage in the Committee1^ proceedings so as to avoid any clash between the two Bills.I should perhaps add that the provisions for overtime in certain special cases which appeared in the 1924 Bill will not be affected.J .B .0.HOME 0B&apos;FICE. 2nd December,   1929,
