Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.     42CP. 334 (29).-CABINET.AGRICULTURE AND EMPLOYMENT.Note by the Lord Privy Seal.1. I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture on certain proposals of the First Commissioner of Works, together with the relevant parts of the First Commissioner^ note.2. I should like my colleagues to study it carefully, as it brings out the present economic difficulties of agriculture. These are important in considering the contri-bution that agriculture can make towards a solution of the urban and industrial employment problem with which we are struggling. It is useless to expect an industry to absorb more labour if it cannot give a secure living to the employers already in it, and afford a wage which, taking all things into consideration, can be compared with the level of urban wages.3. That means that if agriculture is to have its proper place in our economic structure-and no one can doubt the absolute necessity of this for a properly balanced life for our people it must increase its phesent margins of profit and its production. To this end, I believe, our agricultural policy must be directed, and only as that is being achieved can we look forward to an increase in the amount of employment that the agricultural industry can offer. It is for this reason that we can all fully support the marking and marketing policy that the Minister of Agriculture is pursuing. It is possible that in this policy we may have the beginnings of something like prosperity for the industry.4. Obviously, this policy will take time to show its full effects. Meanwhile, as far as I can judge, the best prospects for an early contribution from the land on an appreciable scale to the urban unemployment problems lie in the development of a comprehensive scheme of land drainage. This points to the importance of pressing on as quickly as possible with the two land drainage Bills which are at present under consideration.5. I am proposing to pursue certain matters dealt with in the attached memoranda on Avhich early action may be possible in consultation with the Minister of Agriculture and the First Commissioner of Works.J. H. T.November 20, 1929.
Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture on Proposals (annexed below)of the First Commissioner of Works.The view that agriculture, apart from necessary works on land drainage, ought to make some substantial contribution towards solving the unemployment problem must obviously command sympathy. Farming is clearly in a better position from the unemployment point of view than certain other industries, e.g., mining; there is no surplus of regular workers in agriculture, and up till now there has been no serious unemployment except for a few weeks in the year in certain restricted areas. It is therefore assumed in Mr. Lansbury&apos;s memorandum that many of the unemployed could be placed on the land.Before we examine the proposals, it may be useful, in the first place, to discuss some of the broader economic aspects of agriculture.Condition of the Industry.(1.) The industry is passing through a very difficult period. Prices are low; in particular, arable cultivation, which employs a larger number of men per hundred acres than any other form of agriculture, is suffering because, for the most part, its produce sells at prices which allow very little, if any, margin of profit. In the farmer&apos;s view^ that margin is most seriously affected by the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act, 1924. The result of that Act was that the weekly earnings of farm labourers were raised in 1925 to about 72 per cent, above the pre-war level, coupled with a reduction in the number of working hours. According to some authorities, the increase in farmers&apos; wages bill is put as high as 100 per cent, above pre-war, but obviously many obscure factors would have to be measured before this proportion could be accurately determined. Inevitably, the increased cost of labour has raised the cost of farming in relation to receipts, and this disability obviously increases with the proportion which the cost of labour bears to the total cost of production.Other industries coal, cotton and shipping are subject, broadly speaking, to the same economic difficulties, but these industries, which . produce to order, can meet the situation by closing down uneconomic units and otherwise curtailing uneconomic expenditure and reducing output, far more easily than agriculture.The farming industry, realising that the increase in wages has come to stay, is endeavouring slowly and with some difficulty to adjust itself to the situation. In the long run the rise in labour costs must be met by a change in agricultural practice. Agriculture in this country has developed on the basis of cheap labour its future must, be influenced by the new condition.Under these conditions, and without State intervention, arable agriculture in this country cariot be expected to expand to any considerable extent. As the result of experience spread over many years, farmers in most districts believe that, taking one year with another, they can secure better net profits from grassland than from arable land. There may appear to be thousands of acres idle, but it may nevertheless be the fact that those lands are yielding their occupier more profit than he would derive if they were under the plough. The usual attitude of the spokesmen of English farmers is that if the nation wants more land under the plough, it must make it worth&apos; the farmers&apos; while so to cultivate the land rather than leave it under grass. In other words, additional land will not, in existing circumstances, be ploughed unless the Government of the day is prepared to find a subsidy (or something equivalent to a subsid3^) which would make the occupiers of grassland consider it worth their while to plough.Law of Diminishing Returns.(2.)   Farming is subject to the law of diminishing returns.In a factory or Avorkshop, an increase of output generally means a reduction in unit cost of production. In agriculture, this factor is by no means certain. It has been proved over and over again in scientific research as well as in ordinary farming practice that after a certain point, increased production can only be secured at an unremunerative cost. While it is certainly true that the standard of farming varies considerably, it would be unwise to base policy on the supposition that by more
initiative and business ability a substantial increase of production can be secured in the near future, bringing with it increased profits and more employment of labour.Reference is made in Mr. Lansbury&apos;s memorandum to the Co-operative Whole-sale Society. This Society&apos;s actual experience in farming land has not, however, been a happy one. The Society had all the advantages of adequate capital, efficient marketing organisation and experienced administrative methods; yet it has been obliged to close down practically all its farming operations owing to heavy financial losses.Effect on Labour of Rationalisation.(3.) In manufacturing industry, if means are found whereby one skilled man plus machinery can do the work of two unskilled men, this does not in the long run necessarily lead to a diminution of employment, because output of, as well as demand for, industrial products is elastic, and it is always possible to expand capital resources. But in agriculture, if one man plus machinery can cultivate as much land as two without it, it may well lead, other things being equal, to a diminution of employment, because the amount of land and its productive capacity being limited, the total output cannot be proportionately increased. Conversely, if two men are employed to do work which could be done by one man plus machinery, the standard of living provided by the industry for those engaged in it is likely to be lower than it might be.Bearing these general conditions in mind, we may now consider the proposals made: (a.) Training of unemployed men from the towns; (b.) Settlement on the land; and (c.) Reclamation.(a.) Training.Arrangements could probably be made to train 1,500 men or even more a year at special centres, but the question immediately arises : What is to become of them afterwards? For two years after the War some 4,0.00 to 5,000 Ex-Service men were given agricultural training, but the scheme had to be abandoned because compara-tivefy few were found suitable for settling in small holdings or &quot;cottage holdings, ancl it was proving difficult to absorb any large number as paid workers. To-day, broadly speaking, the rural population provides enough labour for the present demands of agriculture, and is likely to go on providing enough for some years to come unless some unforeseen development occurs, although the number of younger men in the industry is steadily decreasing relative to the number of elder men. It would therefore be difficult to find permanent jobs for trainees as agricultural labourers, and there is some doubt if the ordinary agricultural wage of about 33.*. would be sufficiently attractive to men from urban centres. It therefore seems to be necessary, if a training scheme is to be established on a substantial scale, to accompany it by a definite offer of employment with some prospect beside that of remaining an agricultural labourer. The offer of a small holding is not enough by itself. It would be courting disaster to place men, after a years training, but without capital, on small holdings, however well equipped, unless at the same time the most careful supervision and direction were available; and there are obviously grave objections to any scheme under which men would be farming entirely on money borrowed from the State. Any considerable scheme of training must, therefore, be accompanied by schemes of settlement generally similar to the Ministry&apos;s settlenient at Amesbury with resident directors and an organisation which takes off the trainee at least for a period the responsibilities of farming so far as concerns finance and general direction. The question of establishing such new settlements is discussed below; it is only necessary to point out here that, if 1,200 men a year were available after training, it would be a labour force sufficient for 40,000 acres, assuming that trainees are not likely.to be placed out at the rate of more than three men per 100 acrfes, inasmuch as it would be desirable to mix them with a percentage of experienced agricultural labourers. It would be difficult to provide and equip 40,0,00 acres a year in this country for new settlement.It appears to follow that any experiment in training for home agriculture must be on a small scale, and can have no appreciable effect on the big unemployment problem.
(b.) Settlement.Men could be settled on land in three different ways :  (i.) By the farming community absorbing an additional number of workers, e.g., by making farming, especially the arable variety, more profitable&apos;, (ii.) By the Government itself undertaking farming operations with a view to -employing more men per 1,000 acres than would otherwise be employed, including the taking over of neglected or derelict land and land on the margin of cultivation, (iii.) By the provision of additional small holdings for suitable unemployed men from other industries or for existing agricultural labourers whose places might, to some extent, be filled by trainees.  .(i.) Employment by Farmers. For reasons discussed above, it may be taken that there are no grounds whatever for expecting that the present cultivated area of England and Wales is likely to be able to absorb an increased staff of workers so long as the present economic conditions of the industry remain; in fact, not only the whole trend of economic forces, but also the influence of other activities which the Government is committed to support, such as agricultural research and education, and the improvement of machinery, tend in the direction of decreasing, rather than increasing, employment on the land.(ii.) Government Farms. Whether the Government acquire land already under cultivation, or whether they acquire land which is not under cultivation and make an addition to the cultivated area of the country, it is certain that considerable capital expenditure will be involved, and it is probable that the enterprise will not succeed in producing sufficient to pay an economic return on such capital expenditure, together with the equivalent, in one form or another, of the minimum agricultural wage for each additional man settled. The Government might, for example, as at Amesbury, in Wiltshire, acquire areas of land, comprising some 3,000 to 5,000 acres, and undertake farming operations on its own account through a Director engaged primarily for his business capacity, coupled with knowledge of local conditions. If the land were already under cultivation, it would not involve more than an addition of some five to six men per 1,000 acres, or an increase of about 30 per cent., and the Government would have to provide some  12 per acre for tenants&apos; capital, apart altogether from any expense of acquisition, while, at the same time, embarking on an enterprise which would probably fail to make commercial profits. Moreover, before anything could be achieved, legislation must be passed empowering the Government to acquire and hold land for farming purposes. Given, however, fresh powers of acquisition and the necessary capital, it would be possible to place a distinctly limited number of additional workers on the land in this way over a period of years.(iii.) Small Holdings. Another means which could be adopted for placing additional men on the land would be the provision of small holdings. As stated above, it would be an extremely risky business to place unemployed men from the towns, even after a year&apos;s training in agriculture, on small holdings and expect them to make a success. But as explained in Appendix B to D.U. 4 (29), it might be possible to select some 500 men, e.g., unemployed miners, with considerable previous agricultural experience, and settle them on small holdings at a cost of some  600,000 to  800,000, according to the amount of working capital required.A far more promising method of increasing the rural population is by settling on suitable land the large number of unsatisfied applicants for small holdings who have both the experience and capital necessary to make the enterprise a probable success. At the Ministry&apos;s estate of some 5,000 acres at Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire, the resident population (including women and children) has risen in 10 years from 324 to 743. The annual loss in a normal year is estimated at from  9,000 to  10,000, but, with the lower prices for land and equipment which now prevail, it should be possible to establish similar settlements of small holdings with a lower scale of loss. There are considerable areas of land in Lincolnshire and elsewhere very suitable for closer settlement if the Government are prepared to obtain necessary powers of acquisition and to provide the capital required for furnishing such land with the requisite additional cottages, farm buildings, and other equipment.Again, it might be possible for the State to acquire unequipped land and to find a sufficient number of settlers with the necessary experience who would be prepared to occupy the land with an obligation to provide their own equipment, including dwelling house, buildings, roads, &amp;c. This would obviously limit the risk of the State, but the risk to be faced by the settlers Avould be at least as great as that which
would be avoided by the State although the equipment under such an arrangement would probably involve less money expenditure, on the assumption that the settler would provide much of the labour involved and be prepared to accept a lower standard.It must be recognised, however, that any new scheme of land settlement under-taken by the Government direct will almost inevitably lead to the cessation of even the limited number of new holdings now being provided by County Councils under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1926.Mr. Lansbury proposes that smallholding co-operative colonies &quot; on Danish lines &quot; should be established in this country. The Ministry understands that a few experiments of this kind were made in Denmark, but they proved so unsuccessful that they have now been abandoned.A further possibility of closer settlement may well exist on the considerable areas owned by various Departments of State and public authorities.(c.) Reclamation.If the Government decides to settle men on sub-marginal areas at a cost to the State sufficient to enable them to maintain an adequate standard of living, an enquiry into the bringing back into cultivation, with State aid, of definite areas of disused or under-farmed land could be undertaken. It must, however, be pointed out that even if it were possible to undertake so formidable, lengthy and costly a task as increasing the cultivated area by 1,000,000 acres, such additional area would not be worth in the market more than, say,  30 million possibly much less when reclaimed, Avhile it would cost much more, and it is harly likely that this would provide permanent agricultural employment for more than 30,000 to 40,000 men.Past experience has proved that to reclaim land, wmether from waste, such as heath land, or from the sea, more expenditure is necessary than to buy existing cultivated land. Therefore, the capital involved in any such scheme is likely to be greater per acre than that which would be involved if settlement were limited to land already under cultivation. On the other hand, a greater number of additional workers per acre might result, since there are no existing workers to displace.It would, of course, be physically possible to bring much uncultivated land into use, but is it a practical economic proposition ? Generally speaking, land is derelict for much the same reason as cotton mills are closed down or as coal measures known to exist are derelict or unworked. Given the present degree of technical efficiency in agriculture and the existing margin between costs of production and prices, a certain area is profitable or at least remains under cultivation. If the margin expands the area tends to increase. If it contracts the area tends to diminish. The significant fact of the past decade is that the margin between costs and prices has contracted. Coupled with this is the fact that, generally speaking, it costs more to reclaim and equip land than the land when reclaimed and equipped is worth in the market.Apart from land of the type referred to above, there is also a large area of land suffering from serious under-cultivation, due mainly to the fact that ranch-farming is, under present conditions, more profitable and involves less capital and risk. Provided that power to enforce improvement of cultivation is obtained, a good deal of such land could be made at a price to support a larger population. Considerable capital would, however, be required, and the Government would have to contemplate taking over the lands, as the present owners could hardly be expected to change over to a system of farming which is not so attractive financially.Other Methods of securing Increased Employment.In the Ministry&apos;s opinion, a hopeful means of increasing employment on the land lies in (a) improved marketing;(b) land drainage.(a.) Improved) Marketing.The possibility of increased employment following the reorganisation of agricultural marketing can be looked at from two angles, from that of production &apos;ind from that of distribution.
Take distribution first. It is conceivable that, given a static condition of production, the reorganisation of agricultural marketing might cause a certain amount of unemployment in so far as it achieved greater efficiency in the performance of essential services. Reorganisation involving, for example, in a general conflict with waste, the integration of some functions and the elimination of overlapping in the discharge of others might mean fewer middlemen of all kinds dealers, auctioneers, merchants, commission men and so forth. On the other hand, the steady improvement of marketing technique involving the establishment of grading and packing stations means more employment both direct and indirect-. It is a case of first taking off fat and then putting on muscle. How the balance would lie as marketing reform progressed it is impossible to say.As to production. Reorganisation of agricultural marketing aims at improving the net returns of the producer, either as a result of economies in marketing costs, through the elimination of w^aste in various forms, or of improved prices or both. If it attains this objective, it must lead to increased production, and increased production may lead to increased employment. Organisation to eliminate waste means, in agricultural marketing, discarding old systems for new, and, in so far as it involves the combination of producers into pools, selling agencies and the like, it necessitates toilsome building, step by step, in many places. With a better under-standing of the problems involved, it will not be long, however, before national schemes take shape for a number of our products.The standardisation of the grading and packing of agricultural products so that the goods can be bought on description without prior inspection and sampling is one way of reducing marketing costs, because it simplifies business procedure and reduce.-; trade risks. The Ministry of Agriculture has made rapid strides with a standardise tion programme in the last twelve months, and already statutory grades have been defined for a number of commodities, and schemes have been introduced on a national scale by which these standard products are offered under a common mark to the consuming public. The long-range social advantage of these National Mark schemes is that they will, in time, achieve important economies in the field of distribution. But there is a more immediate advantage which bears directly on the unemployment problem. The use of a National Mark, by identifying the home producer with his produce and his product with quality, enables a powerful appeal to be made to the consuming public to buy home produce in preference to imported supplies. The effect of stimulating a voluntary preference in this way must be to improve producers&apos; prices, and lead to an increase of production.(b.) Land Drainage.It is estimated that there are 1,700,000 acres of land which are either water-logged, and therefore in urgent need of remedial measures, or at all events are in a condition that could be improved by drainage. If this hind, which is distributed all over the country, were properly drained a considerable increase in productivity and in the number of people employed in agriculture on these undrained or badly drained areas may be expected. The only way of dealing effectively with this land, the productive properties of which have in most cases already been established in the past, is to set up effective drainage authorities. Such a proposal requires legis-lation, and the Government has already decided to promote legislation to that end in the coming Session.A comprehensive scheme of drainage as is here contemplated would, however, not be completed in less than 10-12 years, and it could not, therefore, be of immediate help in finding employment. As soon as the necessary legislation is passed, the - Authorities are constituted and the plans of works prepared, a considerable number of men would be required to carry out the schemes, and many of these would probably be retained for maintenance work later on.Summary.To sum up : The standard of living which has been set up by the industrial prosperity of England is having its influence; neither the farmer nor the labourer is likely to be permanently content with a standard below that set by urban industries. A certain number of small holders will be willing to work 14 or 16 hours a day for a return often below the wages of an agricultural labourer, and there are, of course, some districts in which it is possible to extend small holdings.
In France and Belgium, and also in Denmark, a large part of the population is willing to face this kind of life; but English agriculture is not organised on a small-holding basis, and notwithstanding the large number of unsatisfied applicants for small holdings, it seems doubtful whether in a country with our standard of living, and so largely industrialised as England, even if the cost of re-equipment were faced, a sufficient number of men of the kind required would be forthcoming to make small holdings on this Continental model typical of English agriculture. New powers of land acquisition would make settlement on small holdings easier, but, even so, con-siderations of finance and the limited area of suitable land must restrict the possibilities in this direction. If that is so, and if consequently the present organi-sation of agriculture mainly on a basis of farms larger than a one-man unit is likely to continue, then it must be recognised that a policy aimed at having substantially more people on the land and a policy aimed at a higher standard of life for those who work on the land are to some extent opposed to one another. Under present conditions, the higher standard of life can only be attained by getting the same production with a smaller staff.Some improvement may be possible through better marketing, but, even so, it is difficult to believe that this can result in the successful introduction of any number of men from other industries. The one substantial direction in which a demand for labour can be profitably developed is in connection with drainage a neglected field of work which, with adequate machinery established by legislation, should, over a period of years, mean substantial expenditure by drainage authorities.N. B.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, October 24, 1929.Extracts from a Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.I am concerned because at present we only contemplate schemes which we hope will enable industry to function a little better by the provision of cheaper and more efficient means of transport : there is no expectation that what we do will revive trade and industry within a short period.It is not possible to discuss all five basic industries Cotton, Iron and Steel, Shipping, Coal and Agriculture. It appears certain to me that very soon all those connected with these industries will be forced to come to us for assistance in re-organising and rationalising these. I take, however, two examples Agriculture and Coal. There is no one who gives a thought to the subject of agriculture but is appalled by the fact that slowly but surely this, the most vital industry for any nation, in spite of State help of every description, goes from bad to worse. We talk of colonising other lands and our own land, so far as the countryside is concerned, cries aloud for recolonisation. About this there is much talk and writing, but nothing of importance is done.I therefore propose that we ask the Minister of Agriculture to consider immediately how best we can, in conjunction with the training department of the Ministry of Labour, formulate plans for utilising the labour at present unemployed in mining and other areas for the purpose of re-establishing and developing every form of forestry and agriculture in fact, to start the recolonisation of Britain. I do not mean schemes for land drainage and reclamation : these are separate questions and I take it for granted the Minister of Agriculture is dealing with these. Neither do I mean the development of small-holdings as at present under-stood. I mean a scheme for training men for work on the land in this country, not in opposition to emigration, but as something requiring to be done for the good of Great Britain. It is always argued that agriculture will not pay and that our people will not in any circumstances live on the countryside : this is all old-fashioned nonsense and rests on the assumption that life in a village must of necessity be drab, dull and uninteresting. The men we have to deal with co-operate in mill and mine now. The loneliness of the country village is past and gone : the wireless and cinema, motorbus and light railways have changed all this; and as to the hard work, with electricity as our handmaiden and machinery to remove the curse of heavy labour, work on the land can be as attractive and well paid as any other. It must not be forgotten that if we get the men young, they will not have become inured to the curse of working in darkness and will be glad to work in the open air.
Twenty-five years ago men from East London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, West Ham and elsewhere went down into rural areas and turned waste land into prolific wealth-producing land. This can be inspected at any time. It was demonstrated beyond any question that it is possible to train men on the countryside. I myself assisted in working out the experiments at Hollesley Bay, Laindon, Edinburgh, Glasgow and elsewhere, and all who worked at these varied experiments experiments which led the way to the present training centres agree that men from the towns and from industrial villages respond very efficiently to the demands made upon them in learning and working at a new industry; and, what is more, during the very short period during which these experiments were carried on, it was proved that not only could men be trained for migration abroad, but also for settlement at home.Our problem is worse than the problem which faced Mr. Walter Long and Mr. Gerald Balfour in 1903-4-5, and calls for much bigger plans.The transfer system has been tried and the unemployment figures still mount. We transfer men not to new work, but simply to fill places other men are available to fill. I have not yet been able to discover a single man who has been put into a new job i.e., a job for which no local man or boy was available. I do not deny that the problem we have to face does mean transference on a big scale; even Poplar needs suph a scheme. At present we have no real new wrork, and, so far as I can judge, the only plan which offers a true remedy is to go back to the source of all wealth the land. Because this is so, I urge that the Minister of Agriculture shall be requested to consider with the Minister of Labour how best to utilise training centres for the purpose of land settlement in Great Britain. In making this proposal it is necessary to add that time is of importance, and, given goodwill and co-operation between the Departments concerned, a start could immediately be made. I am told we have power to extend our training settlements, and my proposition is to use our training in such a manner as to create new settlements.It is, however, not for me in this memorandum to lay down details of how the Minister and his advisers should proceed. I would, however, like to be allowed to discuss matters with them, because my experience, wdiich is not small, convinces me that two or three big schemes could be devised -within which a considerable number of miners now eating out their hearts in idleness and hopelessness could be put to work clearing and cultivating land, erecting buildings and cottages, and thus creating settlements organised ancl set going on a co-operative basis, similar to those which are carried on so successfully in Denmark and elsewhere. Already, trainees have built cottages and many other buildings on the training farms.I do not suggest that every trainee will become a settler or that every settlement should be one for Danish farming; they would be varied in character, though I should most strongly urge that at least one big experiment on the Danish lines should be undertaken in order that we may be able to demonstrate whether or not we are able to produce and grade eggs, butter, bacon and cheese as efficiently as it is done elsewhere.The argument that the British farmer will not co-operate does not hold good, because, as I have already said, we are dealing with men who are not tied to tradition and who have no preconceived notions as to individualism or socialism. They are men who have been accustomed to wrork in company with one another, and, to some extent, to exercise the principle of co-operation.As to how we should get the land : w^hile going round the Government training-centres in Norfolk the other day I was informed that there are many, many miles of Crown lands at present unused.  For a start, this land should be available.The argument against any proposals for land development is that agriculture does not pay and cannot be made to pay in this country. I refuse to subscribe to that doctrine. Nobody had yet settled down to the job of nationally reorganising and rationalising argiculture. A scheme such as we could set going would at least start us on the road.It is said that if land cultivation paid, private persons would find the necessary money. This would have been a true argument years ago, and, in fact, is an argument against giving national help to railways and public utility companies, as we propose to do in the Development Bill. The reason railway companies and others need our help is because people who invest money get a bigger rate of interest from foreign investments, and also because bad trade, new transport facilities, &amp;c, have brought railways to the point of ruin. Foreign investments have enabled Southern England to become prosperous at a time -when the basic industries are in so evil a plight.
GThis much is clear : idle land and idle men stare us in the face, and both are a sign and symbol of decadence. If I am asked, do I want the State to be landowner, farmer, salesman, &amp;c, my answer is, I do not care how the business is organised, so long as the job is done. Money is loaned people to settle abroad; it is just as easy to find the capital and set up organisations in Britain to do this as it is in Australia or elsewhere. Our Co-operative Wholesale Society might help us with advice or with men but these are all matters for the Ministers of Agriculture and Labour to discuss. We are loaning money and giving credit facilities to railway companies and others; we ought to be able to find money and credit for this, and our training establishments show how it can be done, and done at once, on a very large scale.G. L.July 22, 1929.
