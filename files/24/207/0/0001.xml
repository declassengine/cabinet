(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAOESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETOTFT^Tl ( 29 ) C(2P7 No .CABINET. &quot; &apos;-WIRELESS    TELEPHONY. Memorandum by^the Ej3 ^j^fl^J;r&apos; General.I.    A question of policy lias arisen in connexion with the establishment of Imperial and foreign wireless telephone services upon which I desire the decision of the Cabinet.2,    It will be remembered that the late Government, in conformity with the recommendations of the Imperial V/ireless Conference of 1928. decided to transfer the cable and wireless telegraph services to the Communications Company (formed by a merger of the Marcnl Company and the Eastern Cable group), but to retain telephone services in the hands of the Government0    The present issue is whether these telephone services should be operated through the medium of the Post Office wireless station at Rugby or through the Beam telegraph stations which were leased to the Communications Company.3c    The Company claim that the use of their Beam stations, which are situated in different parts of the country, would ^e more eoonomioal and more efficient.      On the other hand,  I am advised on grounds which it is unnecessary here to elaborate that greater efficiency at a lower cost would be obtained by concentrating all these services at the Rugby station.    The object of the Company in pressing for the use of their stations is no doubt partly in order to obtain a substantial annual payment in the nature of rent or royalty from the Post Office.    But they have also stated that if the Government will permit them they will open telephone services with most european countries
countries,  the Far East and South America,  and they ask that only one authority,  i.e.,   negotiations Company itself,  should be concerned with the provxoion of the overseas wireless links. There is no doubt to my mind that the Company in pressing their claim hope eventually to acquire the telephone services as they have acquired the telegraph services,  and they realise that this transfer would be greatly facilitated if the services were worked through their own stations than if it involved,  aa it would otherwise involve,, the scrapping of a large,  efficient and profitable wireless oentre at Rugby.40    Whilst the decision which is now required must be governed mainly by technical and financial considerations,it is clear that a vital question of policy lies in the background.I suggest therefore the appointment of a small Committee of Ministers to examine the problem.GENERAL.POST OFFICE H, B.  L-S.8 November I929.
