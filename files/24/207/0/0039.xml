[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE- PR0PSRTY*&quot;0E HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO VTSRNIENT ] . SECRET.cXT48/29, COpy *To&apos;-CABINET.RAISING   THE   SCHOOL   LEAVING   AGE. Maintenance Allowances. TOQRANDUH by the PRESIDENT of the BOARD OE EDUCATION. My colleagues may remember that in discussing the question of maintenance allowances in my previous memorandum on the School Leaving Age (CP.204(29)), I said:-&quot;It will have to be decided whether allowances are &quot;to be given as a right or whether the Local Education &quot;Authority is to award them in accordance with a need &quot;standard.    It will also have to be decided whether the &quot;granting of allowances shall be made a requirement on &quot;the Local Education Authority&quot;. At the same time I expressed the view that it would be doubt-ful policy to compel the Local Education Authorities to pay maintenance, and probably wiser to offer them increased financial inducements to adopt a liberal scale.TShen I met the representative Associations of Local-Authorities I found that, while they pressed for substantial Exchequer assistance in respect of their expenditure on maintenance allowances, they were opposed to any system of universal and indiscriminate allowances, and that they were, I think unanimously, in favour of a plan under which these allowances would be awarded in necessitous cases only and in accordance with the needs of the family.    They thought that it might be necessary to provide for some variation in cost of living, wages of juveniles, etc., in different parts of the country;   but they declared that it was of the highest import-ance from their point of view, as it would undoubtedly be from the point of view of the Exchequer, that national scales should be prescribed and that strict adherence to these scales should bo ma.de a condition of Exchequer grant.    They .
volunteered to help me to formulate scales, and expressed their willingness to serve, in a representative capacity, on any Committee I might appoint for the purpose.No course1 is easy for us in Parliament.   We have many of our own Party who will demand a universal system of allow-ances, some who will put the weekly allowance very high and many who, no doubt, will want to make it compulsory on Local Education Authorities on the ground that they are under Conservative control.   On the other hand, we should be subject to political opposition from the Conservatives, for, though the most reputable part of their Party sides with us on the question of raising the school age, they would probably unite in an attack upon universal allowances.   All we can do then is to consider how we can fulfil the real essence of the demand.   It comes direct from the poverty of the larger part of the population.    There are numbers of the parents who, although most anxious for the education of their children, are very reluctant to lose the wage pittance which the children are sometimes able to get after 14.    Our Party will generally expect us to make provision which will secure the poor some alternative to their present chance of wages.     We must then be fairly liberal in our rate of grant in order to make it improbable that those who need the allowance will be refused.   Por that reason while I do not propose a universal system of allowances or to make them compulsory on the Local Education Authority, I have obtained the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the State should pay grant on the allowances at the unusual rate of 60^. thus encouraging Local Education Authorities to pay them.   The Chancellor of. the Exchequer has also agreed to 5A as the amount of the weekly allowance which should rank for grant.o
As regards the children who are to receive the allowances,   if the Cabinet decides that maintenance allowances should not be universal and that they shall be related to need, we can either adopt one scale of need, &quot;based on the earnings . of the ohildron&apos;s parents,  for the country as a whole or we can appoint a Committee of representatives of the Local Authorities to frame standard scales of need for different parts of the country.     Undoubtedly the simplest course would he to have one scale of need for the whole country.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer would in that event he prepared to take as the scale an annual wage of  150:    that is to say,  that, the parents of a child of 14 - 15 who did not toge^he?/&apos; (iarn more than  150 annually would qualify for a maintenance allowance.     On the other hand, some of the Local Authorities appear to object to a universal scale of need and in order to 31)euro their co-operation the course might bo considered of accepting their suggestion of a Committee to draw up,  say, 3 or 4 scales of need which would, as in the case of Burnham Salaries,  take into account the broad variation in the cost of living in different parts of the country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also wishes to make the maintenance grant  tentative and temporary.      I do not foel that I could sustain an argument in the House that an impoverished family in 1938 was not to expect a grant which the nation thought justifiable in 1932,      But I should not feel the same difficulty in an announcement that the form and amount of the grant was provisional and subject to revision after the experience of five years.I append an estimate of the additional cost of raising the school age with maintenance allowances on the scale described.30th November 1929. C.T,
V O (J*APPENDIX.Estimated cost if 50 per cent of the additional number on registers are given Maintenance Allowances of 5/-a week and the State pays 60 per cent - 2, 574,000 borne as t6 1,544,400 by taxes  1,029,600 by rates.In order to give a total figure of the cost of raising the school age there should be added the cost of ordinary provision for the extra year,  i*e, capitation grant, teachers&apos; salaries, accommodation,  etc., namely:- 2,532,500 borne as to 2,154,900 by taxes     377,600 by rates.This gives with Maintenance Allowance a total of  5,106,500 borne as to 3,699,300 by taxes  1,407,200 by rates.
