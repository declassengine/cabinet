This document is the property of His Britannic BSajesty&apos;s Government. ./v g,Printed for the Cabinet, December, 1929.SECRET.Copy No.  \CP. 356 (.39).THE CABINET.THE   FULLER   EMPLOYMENT   OF   AIR   POWER   in imperial   DEFENCE.NOTE BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The paper circulated by the Secretary of State for Air (CP. 332 (29)) raises questions of first class importance, not only in the spheres of Imperial Defence, but also in matters of high national policy. At this stage it is clearly impossible for me to offer any remarks on the detailed proposals which it contains, but even the most cursory study of it indicates that the Committee, which it recommends should be set up to review the whole matter, will require wide terms of reference and will be unable to arrive at correct conclusions without the interrogation of a wide circle of witnesses. For instance, the suggested substitution of air for military command on the North-West Frontier of India is a matter which will require not only the military consideration of. the Commander-in-Chief in India, but will involve constitutional issues in which we shall have to be guided largely by the advice of the Government of that country. Again, the assumption of command by an officer of the Royal Air Force, responsible to the Air Ministiw, over troops raised and paid by the local administrations ot the Sudan and of our East and West African Colonies will require reference to those local administrations.2. In spite of the footnote on page 1, recent events in Palestine do not seem to me to support the arguments advanced in the body of the paper. My military advisers are in such complete disagreement with the policy underlying the paper, especially as regards coast defence, that I must be given time to consider my reply.3. As the Secretary of State for Air urges that the proposals of the Chief of the Air Staff should receive serious consideration on the grounds of the urgent need for economy, I desire equally an examination, in conjunction with the Treasury, of the question of the present constitution of the Royal Air Force as a separate service, with what seems to me to be duplication of- staff and administrative services. I am of opinion that a close scrutiny of this problem will reveal the fact that substantial economies, without any loss of efficiency, can be thus effected.4. It is accordingly apparent that, if the Cabinet should decide to set up a Committee as suggested by the Secretary of State for Air, adequate time must be allowed for the preparation and submission of the views of the many authorities whom it will be necessary to consult. In a matter of such prime importance to Imperial Defence we cannot afford to be precipitate.T. S.The War Oefice,7th December, 1929.(b29/17)   00   12/^9   w.o.p.   4775
