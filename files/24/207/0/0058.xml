DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO:    cabinet.GRANTS TO MECESSITOPS AREAS.Memorandum by thei Chancellor of the Exchequer.Since the Minister of Health has himself set out the objections to his plan (CP. 303 ( 29)) I need not wasto time in elaborating them but I must nevertheless mako a few remarks on the matter.     Every single one of his predecessors, including Mr, Wheat ley, has found it Impossible to deal with the problem of necessitous areas except on the basis of a fundamental change of the magnitude of the Rating Scheme of the late Government and it will be remembered that the redistribution of burdens effected by that scheme involves a charge of nearly  10 millions a year on the Exchequer, a great deal of which goes to necessitous areas.     Notwithstanding this the Minister formed the opinion early in November that the position in the mining areas was so bad that something must be done.      He pointed out, however, that the objections to doing anything are almost insuperable, but produced a scheme for spending  500,000.      In order, however, to minimise Its undesirable repercussions he 3aid that it must be confined to mining areas,  as otherwise it would be impossible to know whore to draw the line.     After discussion with me he agreed to hold up his demand until we hod ascertained what the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund contemplated doing during the winter.      I therefore obtained and circulated to the Cabinet a report from those admi nlst.erlng this Fund, the (29) general effect of which was that the situation in the mining areas was not nearly so bad as last year and that the resources of the Fund were adequate for dealing with the matter unless it was-1-ORE I.367 (29j.
to bo ucod in effect to supplement, reges.Early this month the Cabinet accepted this view.      Kext the Minister of Health, having received a deputation of women who complained that the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund and the Guardians aro too strict,  again produces his scheme, adding however that it cannot be confined to mining areas but must be given in all necessitous areas.      Yet he seems to think it would still be possible to keep a maximum of  500,000.The next thing will be that he will discover that this sum is quite inadequate and that We must raise the limit to several millions.     And having given these grants for two winters we shall have to repeat them next year on an even higher scale. And so we shall go on.I do not believe that the Minister1s scheme can be kept within reasonable and safe limits and I do believe that, even apart from finance, it is likely to have gravely embarrassing consequences.      I trust, therefore, that the Cabinet will support me in my emphatic opinion that it should be rejected.Incidentally I may say that the information furnished by the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations docs not seem to mo to prove anything more definite than that, as Is Inevitable, there are individual complaints against the administration of the Lord Iuayor!s Fund.      In very few cases is it alleged that there is difficulty in obtaining milk for mothers and children.      The worst distress appears to be among men earning low wages and single unemployed men.      We cannot contemplate subsidising wages, but as regards the unemployed I would point out that a substantial part of the large increase of expenditure from the Unemployment Fund which will result from the Bill just passed by the House of Commons will go to the necessitous areas.(Intd.)    P.S,Treasury Chambers, .,18th December, 1929.
