Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1929.SECRET. Copy No.      42CP. 365 (29).CABINET.THE FULLER EMPLOYMENT OF AIR POWER IN IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Memorandum by the secretary of State for Air.1. I FEAB from the terms of his memorandum CP. 356 (29) that the Secretary of State for War has not understood the purport of my paper CP. 332 (29), since the latter document merely seeks a decision of the Cabinet in regard to the setting up of a Committee. No question arises of Cabinet consideration of any detailed proposals whatsoever nor, as yet, of the terms of reference to the Committee or its composition. The reasons for this course are fairly obvious, viz., that the Cabinet cannot possibly, until the ground has been cleared by some other body, reach a decision on questions at once so technical and covering so wide a field. Some months&apos; preliminary work by the proposed Committee including, of course, &quot; the interrogation of a wide circle of witnesses &quot; will probably be needed. Ample time will, therefore, be available for the preparation of the War Office case, and I suggest, with all respect that any detailed commentary by that department on the proposals in CP. 332 (29) would at this stage be premature, not to say redundant.2. In paragraph 1 of his memorandum, the Secretary of State for War refers to the &quot; constitutional issues &quot; in India raised by Sir Hugh Trenchard&apos;s paper, as though the scheme of air control recommended for the North-West Frontier would come as a surprise and shock to the Govern-ment of India. The Cabinet should know, however, that, in 1922, the Viceroy&apos;s Council approved a not dissimilar proposal (though of more restricted scope) with only one dissentient the Commander-in-Chief. At that time the Iattev&apos;s chief argument against this proposal was that no experience had been gained of air control in a large area, and he urged that the results of the experiment in Iraq should first be awaited. Those results are manifest and constitute a complete refutation of the pessimistic forecasts of the then secretary of State for War, whose alternative proposals would have entailed the retention of 12 battalions of infantry and numerous other Army formations in Iraq at about six times the cost of the Air Force units now garrisoning that country.*3. The Secretary of State for War proceeds in his second paragraph to ask for time to consider his reply. I confess that I am not quite clear as to what this means. As I have said, no detailed reply from the War Office is necessary at this juncture. All I have asked in my paper is that the Cabinet shall set up a Committee, before which his advisers, as well as many others, can give the fullest evidence on the points of policy in which they are especially interested.4.   His next paragraph contains a suggestion which makes it difficult to believe that the Secretaryof State for War has studied the past history of the matter to which he draws attention.   He asks for &quot;an examination of the present constitution of the Boyal Air Force as a separate service,&quot;apparently ignoring the fact that, since 1917, leaving out of account enquiries of minor importance,this examination has been made already ten times, from all the different aspects of the question, bya whole series of major investigating bodies, as shown in the list below: T     ..   ..     n , Date of FindingInvestigating Body. n   - -&quot;      &quot; or Decision.(1.)

December 1925.* It has indeed been calculated that (as compared with the estimate put forward by the War Office in 1921 for the cost of garrisoning the country with ground troops) Air Control in Iraq has, during the seven years for which it has functioned, saved the Exchequer a sum which, invested at 5 per cent., would pay the whole cost of the Air Ministry three times over in perpetuity!t This was the same Cabinet as (7) above, but Mr. Baldwin had succeeded Mr. Bonar Law as Prime Minister and various other changes had taken place in its composition. Moreover, whereas (7) were reviewing the report of (6), on the present occasion the whole question of the independence of the Royal Air Force was considered at length in its fullest implications.[20302] T21 098]
These enquiries were carried out by statesmen, business men and officials of indisputable authority, as will be seen from their names: Statesmen.Mr. Lloyd George.Mr. Bonar Law.Mr. Baldwin.The Duke of Devonshire.Lord Balfour.Lord Curzon.Lord Milner.Lord Salisbury.Lord Cave.Lord Peel.Lord Cecil.Lord Irwin.Loid Brentford.Sir Austen Chamberlain.Mr. Barnes.Mr. Neville Chamberlain. Mr. Amery. General Smuts.Business Men.Lord Inchcape. Lord Weir. Lord Colwyn. Lord Forres. Lord Melchett. Lord Faringdon. Lord Maclay. Sir Eric Geddes. Sir Guy Granet. Sir Philip Nash.Treasury Officials.^Lord Chalmers (a former Per-manent   Secretary   to   theTreasury). Lord Bradbury (a former Per-manent   Secretary   to   theTreasury). Sir G. Barstow (a former Con-troller of Supply Services atthe Treasury).Without exception the result was in every case an unequivocal verdict in favour of a separate Air Force and Air Ministry. As their reports and other relevant documents run into several hundred pages, I do not suggest that my colleagues should peruse them : the following brief summary will, I hope, suffice to make the matter clear.5. The decision to create a unified Air Service was first taken in 1917, because the system of dual Air Forces, i.e., separate Naval and Army Air Services, had, under the crucial test of war, been tried and found wanting.-)- General Smuts presided over the Committee on Air Organisation which recommended the institution of the Eoyal Air Force; his report stated that the old organisation of a separate Boyal Naval Air Service and Eoyal Flying Corps led inevitably to &quot; competition, friction, and waste.&quot; Much of this waste was due to &quot; duplication of staff and administrative services,&quot; to employ the phraseology of the Secretary of State for War in his present memorandum. Acting on this report, the War Cabinet decided in August 1917 to establish a unified air service under a separate Air Ministry. Such a decision, taken as it was while hostilities were in progress and involving as it did the creation of a new fighting service, is a sufficient indication of the urgent need for re-organisation and the perils to which muddled and overlapping administration had exposed the nation.It is no exaggeration to say that, dating from the institution of a separate Air Ministry, the efficiency of our air operations was so substantially and rapidly developed, that by the end of the war, not only had the British Air Force gained complete ascendancy in the air, but, in the opinion of an American Commission of Enquiry, Great Britain held the lead in all branches of aviation.6. Since the only real test of a defence organisation is its efficiency in war, and the First Sea Lord of the day had two months after the Armistice, in a memorandum circulated to the Cabinet, expressly testified to his general satisfaction with the working of the unified system, it might have been thought that no further attempt would be made by the older Services to restore the dual system which had so lamentably broken down. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The ink was hardly dry on the Peace Treaties when the War Office and Admiralty attempted to regain control of a new weapon, whose functions they had never understood and which they had consistently misapplied. Their efforts were directed, not to the substitution of the Air Arm for the more archaic weapons with which they were familiar, but rather to its use as an auxiliary and subsidiary arm, thus not only closing the door on possible economies, but actually adding a new burden to our national expenditure on armaments, while leaving the country and our overseas possessions without efficient protection against the most formidable menace of the future air attack.Indeed, the majority of naval and military critics, like the Bourbons, seemed to have learned nothing, and forgotten nothing except the lessons of the war. Ignoring the fact that the result of the next war may be decided before land or sea forces can be mobilised, they aimed at splitting the Air Force between the Army and Navy, thus reviving a system of divided control which would inevitably retard and cramp air action and weaken our first line of defence at a time of crisis. In short, their attitude towards the tremendous potentialities of aircraft was that of the farmer in the fable towards the winged horse Pegasus, who harnessed it to a cart.7. The first major post-war examination of this question was conducted by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1921 under the Chairmanship of Lord Balfour. After the matter had been exhaustively debated over a period of months by all parties to the controversy, his first and principal finding was &quot; That the Air Force must be autonomous in matters of administration and educatiou.&quot;* 1 have included this column since the Secretary of State for War stresses the &quot; Treasury &quot; aspect. It is&apos; pertinent that the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the Colwyn Committee were also Treasury experts.I 1 may add that before it was decided to institute a separate Air Force and Air Ministry a whole series of half-way houses towards unification were also tried without success.
8. In August 1921 the Committee on National Expenditure was appointed under the Chairman-ship of Sir Eric Geddes, and the attacks on the autonomy of the Air Force were renewed before this body, the pretext being economy. It is of speoial importance here to note that the sole object of this Committee was the curtailment of expenditure, and in this connection the following extract from their report is significant: &quot; Without a separate existence, there is grave danger that the Air Service would be unable to work out developments which might in the next decade or so entirely revolutionise methods of attack and defence and render possible very large economies in the cost of the Fighting Services as a whole, by substituting air for land and sea forces.&quot;The same report pointed out that an essential feature of the case for a unified air service was that, if the Air Force were divided, much &quot;duplication&quot; would inevitably be entailed. The Geddes Committee&apos;s report was reviewed by a special Cabinet Sub-Committee and was subsequently brought, as were also Lord Balfour&apos;s findings, before the Cabinet as a whole. The verdict in favour of the Eoyal Air Force was confirmed and announced to Parliament in March, 1922, as the considered policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.9. The Committee marked No. 6 in the table in paragraph 5 above was not appointed to review the specific issue of the independence of the Eoyal Air Force, but to investigate a question which is, however, directly relevant to the enquiry proposed by the Secretary of State for War in CP. 356 (29), viz., the possibility of amalgamating the common services of the Navy, Army and Air Force, &quot; auch as Intelligence, Supply, Transport, Education, Medical, Chaplains.&quot; Its report shewed that the alleged &quot; duplication&quot; under the present system was greatly exaggerated, and that no substantial economy could be secured by the amalgamation of common services, whilst efficiency would definitely suffer. This report was duly examined and approved by the Cabinet and laid before Parliament.10. In March 1923 the Sub-Committee of National and Imperial Defence was appointed and, after taking the most voluminous evidence from quarters inside and outside the services, drafted its report in July of that year. A similar verdict to those of previous Committees was recorded and confirmed by the Cabinet after prolonged investigation and discussion.11. I will now pass to the so-called &quot; Colwyn Committee.&quot;* This was appointed in August 1925 to investigate expenditure on the Navy, Army and Air Force. Once more the War Office and Admiralty renewed their attacks on the system of maintaining a separate Air Force and Air Ministry, but the upshot was the following considered judgment by a body, which consisted of an eminent man of business and two former Treasury officials of the highest standing: &quot; We find no remedy .... in the abolition of the Air Ministry which is urged by the two older Departments. On the contrary, we affirm the necessity for an independent Air Ministry to administer a single unified Air Service, which should carry out all air work, whether for the Navy,Army or central Air Force. We do not think that the estimates of administrative savings which the other two Departments claim would result from its dismemberment would materialise; nor would any such savings compensate for the greater savings which we hope will be secured by the extended substitution of air power as a substantive arm-a development which depends on the continued existence of a separate air authority . . . .&quot;12. With this authoritative document before them, the Government of the day felt that a term must finally be set to a long drawn-out and sterile controversy, and, in reply to a Private Notice question by Mr. MacDonald, then leader of the Opposition, Mr. Baldwin made, on the 25th February 1926, the following statement in the House: &quot;I think it essential to announce that, in accordance with the policy of successive Administra-tions, the Government have no intention of reopening the question of a separate Air Arm and Air Ministry. We intend- to pursue the organisation of Imperial Defence on the existing basis of three co-equal Services. It is in the interests of the Fighting Services that controversy upon this subject should now cease. We are convinced that the way to secure the higher co-ordination in our Defence machinery, indispensable to full efficiency and, indeed, to economy, lies not in the abolition of any one of the three established arms of His Majesty&apos;s Forces, but in combined action between all three through the machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence and the agency of ihe recently instituted Committee of Chiefs of Staff. We are sure that we can rely upon all concerned to devote themselves loyally and wholeheartedly to this end.&quot;13. I have felt it necessary to give this summary of the past history of a question which was settled years ago in principle, arid should never have been allowed to degenerate into an interdepart-niental wrangle. If this old sore is to be perpetually reopened whenever national problems of defence are being discussed, no progress can be made along the lines laid down in the Geddes and Colwyn Reports.Sir Hugh Trenchard&apos;s paper indicates ways and means of implementing those reports. His detailed suggestions may have to be modified after full inquiry, but, coining from a man with bis experience, they deserve serious consideration.1 submit that the case for an inquiry is clear, and urge mj ^olle;igues to keep it free from the embittering echoes of an irrelevant and exploded controversy. t&apos;       . T.Air Ministry, December \ 6, 1929.* Chairman, Lord Oolvvyn ; Members, Lords Chalmers and Bradbury.
