Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    32CP. 336 (29).CABINET.visit or The prime minister to Canada (October is to 26,1929).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN the Memorandum recently Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister regarding his conversations with Mr. Mackenzie King during his visit to Ottawa in October, it was mentioned that a report on the itinerary followed by the Prime Minister and his party in Canada, the public functions they attended, and the character of the welcome received was being furnished by the High Commissioner in Canada for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. This report has now been received, and I circulate it herewith for the information of my colleagues.Dominions Office, November 26, 1929.Despatch from the High Commissioner in Canada for His Majesty&apos; s Government inthe United Kingdom.Office of the High Commissioner (No. 216.) for the United Kingdom,My Lord, Ottawa, November 1, 1929.SINCE being requested to undertake the preparation of the detailed itinerary and programme for the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Canada a work which was carried out in close consultation with his Excellency the Governor-General and with Mr. Mackenzie King I have sent a certain number of communications on this subject, and copies of the detailed programme have been sent to your Lordship&apos;s Department. In my despatch No. 211 of the 24th October I transmitted a summary of the general course of press comment prepared during the visit, for the information of the Prime Minister&apos;s staff, to whom the best available press reports of each of the Prime Minister&apos;s speeches have also been supplied. I Have nowr the honour to submit a more connected account of the visit and of the public engagements undertaken by the Prime Minister in the Dominion, and to forward further copies of the various speeches made by Mr. MacDonald.2. The Prime Minister entered Canada by the Ealls View Bridge at Niagara Falls, crossing the white line which marks the international boundary at 12-30 p.m. on the 15th October. He was welcomed officially by Mr. E. C. Mieville on behalf of the Governor-General, and Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Coghill, representing the Dominion Government. Mr. Sw^ayze, Mayor of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Dr. H. Y. Grant, of the Parks Commission, also took part in the ceremony of welcome. After broadcasting a brief message to express his pleasure at setting foot on Canadian soil, the Prime Minister and his party were entertained at luncheon by the Parks Commission, large crowrds being present to greet the Prime Minister on his arrival on the Canadian bank of the river. The press report of the informal speech made by the Prime Minister on this occasion is enclosed.*3. Early in the afternoon, the Prime Minister embarked at Niagara Falls Station in the special train of the Canadian National Railways, which had been placed at his disposal by Sir Henry Thornton, and by which he travelled from point*Not printed.[20201] b
to point throughout his visit to Canada. Brief stops which were made at St. Catharines and Hamilton enabled the citizens of each of these places to voice their enthusiastic greetings at the railway stations. Between Hamilton and Toronto the Prime Minister received the party of pressmen for whom I had arranged with Sir Henry Thornton that special accommodation should be provided on the train. I enclose the press version of this interview,?? in which the Prime Minister asked them not to attempt to measure the success of his mission by dramatic announcements, but to realise that his task was to create conditions in which favourable results could be achieved.4. Arriving at the Union Station, Toronto, at 6 p.m. the Prime Minister was greeted by the Hon. W. D. Ross, Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, and Mrs. Ross, and motored to Government House, the route being lined with cheering crowds.&apos; A dinner was given in honour of the Prime Minister by the Lieutenant-Governor at Government House on that evening. A list of the guests who were present is enclosed. *5. On the morning of the 16th October a deputation of Hungarian-born Canadian citizens presented themselves without authority at Government House to hand the Prime Minister an address of welcome and of thanks for his interest in post-war Hungary. The deputation was not received, and they left the address with the A.D.C. to the Lieutenant-Governor.6. At 10-15 a.m., accompanied ,by Miss Ishbel MacDonald, Sir Robert Vansittart and Lord Arnold, the Prime Minister left Government House and visited the Convention of the American Federation of Labour, then in session at the Royal York Hotel. The Federation comprises trade unions whose membership extends both to the United States and Canada. Their invitation had in the first instance been refused in accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s wishes, but this decision was subsequently reversed, and I received telephone instructions from Sir Robert Vansittart in New York to accept the engagement. The Convention Hall was filled with 1,800 delegates, whose cheers and applause lasted several minutes as Mr. William Green, the President of the Convention, introduced the Prime Minister.   I transmit copies of the Prime Ministers speech on this occasion.*7. At 12-45 Mr. MacDonald was the guest of the Canadian Club of Toronto. No less than 1,700 members were present, of whom several hundreds were accom-accommodated in an adjoining room, to &quot;which the speeches were broadcast. The guests at the head table included the Lieutenant-Governor and the Prime Minister of Ontario, and representative leaders of the Church, State, labour and business world. Copies of the speech made by Mr. MacDonald are enclosed.*8. Meanwhile, Miss MacDonald, who, yielding to an insistent demand, had earlier made a short but much appreciated speech at the Labour Convention, was the guest of the Women&apos;s Canadian Club, and spoke on the work of &quot;women in England. -9. In the afternoon Mr. MacDonald was escorted by Sir Robert Falconer, President of the Toronto University, to the Convocation Hall of the University, where, at 3 p.m., he received the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from the hands of Sir William Mulock, Chancellor of the University. Student enthusiasm ran riot, and a distinguished gathering was present in the body of the hall to wutness the ceremony and hear the speech given by Mr. MacDonald. I enclose a press report of the speech.*10. From 4 to 6 p.m. the Prime Minister and Miss Ishbel MacDonald attended a reception tendered by Mr. Ferguson, Premier of Ontario, on behalf of the Provincial Government, at the Royal York Hotel, and in the evening an informal dinner for men only was given in the Prime Ministers honour at Government House. I transmit a list of the guests who were present at this dinner.* The party left by special train later in the evening and travelled to Ottawa.11. The following morning (the 17th October), the special train was drawn into the station at Ottawa at 9-30 a.m. Representatives of the Governor-General, Mr. Mackenzie King, with members of his Cabinet, the United States Minister, the French Minister, and the Japanese Charge d&apos;Affaires were assembled on the platform.   Mr. Mackenzie King invited me to accompany him into the car to greet
the Prime Minister, who then descended to the platform. On alighting from the train, Mr. Mackenzie King presented the representatives of foreign countries and the members of his Cabinet. Admission to the railway station had been strictly limited, but hearty cheers were raised as the party passed to the exit between two lines of Royal Canadian Mounted Police in full dress. There was a further ovation as the Prime Minister passed into the street and drove to Rideau Hall, where he, with Miss macdonald and the whole of his staff, were the guests of their Excellencies during their stay at the capital.12. The official photographers and press photographers were allowed to do their work at 10-30 a.m., after which Mr. MacDonald received press correspondents and gave them an informal interview. I enclose a transcript of the Prime Ministers remarks, as reported by the press. *13. After lunching at Government House, Mr. MacDonald was taken by Mr. Mackenzie King to the latter&apos;s country estate at Kingsmere, situated in the Gatineau Hills about 12 miles from the capital. Here the two Prime Ministers spent the afternoon in private conversation. Meanwhile Miss MacDonald had paid a visit to the Women&apos;s Press Club at noon, and in the afternoon took tea as the guest of the May Court Club.14. In the evening the Prime Minister was the guest of the Government of Canada at an official dinner given in the Reading Room of Parliament Buildings at 8 p.m. When the Federal Parliament is not in Session it is seldom that more than a third of the Cabinet are to be found in Ottawa or in its neighbourhood at any time, and it is noteworthy that from their homes in all parts of Canada the Cabinet Ministers had journeyed to Ottawa to be present on this important occasion, many of them having made a journey of several days to be present. I enclose a list showing those who were present at the dinner.* The people of Canada are accustomed to speeches of a very high order, and they are accustomed also to speeches in the cause of peace; but I venture to express the opinion, which has been endorsed by everyone present with whom I have spoken, that the Prime Ministers speech on this occasion, which was broadcast also throughout the length and breadth of Canada, was one of those rare utterances which leave a lasting impression on the minds of those who had the privilege of hearing it. I transmit a verbatim press report of the speech (Appendix).15. During his speech at the Government dinner Mr. Mackenzie King had announced that he proposed to invite the Prime Minister to become a member of the Privy Council of Canada, and this ceremony was performed at Government House at 11 - 30 a.m. on the 18th October, when the Oath was administered by the Clerk of the Privy Council in the presence of the Governor-General and Mr. Mackenzie King. Mr. MacDonald, Miss MacDonald and Lord Arnold then accompanied their Excellencies and Mr. Mackenzie King to the opening of an exhibition of pictures at the National Gallery of Canada.16. Mr. MacDonald, Lord Arnold and Sir Robert Vansittart attended a luncheon given by Mr. R. B. Bennett, Leader of the Opposition, at the Country Club at 1-15 p.m., while Miss MacDonald lunched as the guest of Mrs. Thorburn at the Chelsea Club.17. In the afternoon, after conversations between the Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King and other members of the Cabinet in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s office, Mr. MacDonald and Miss MacDonald were entertained at tea by Mr. Phillips, United States Minister to Canada, and Mrs. Phillips at the Chateau Laurier Hotel. In the evening, at 8-15 p.m., the whole party dined as guests of their Excellencies at Rideau Hall.  The list of guests who were present on this occasion is enclosed.*18. On Saturday, the 19th October, I had the honour, with Lady Clark, of entertaining to luncheon the Prime Minister and Miss MacDonald, Lord Arnold and Sir Robert Vansittart at my house. During the afternoon conversations were resumed between the two Prime Ministers and other members of the Cabinet. Miss MacDonalcl took tea with the Women&apos;s Canadian Club at the Chateau Laurier Hotel at 4-30 p.m., where she addressed the members on social welfare work in England, and in the evening the Prime Minister and Miss MacDonald attended a private dinner given in their honour by Mr. Mackenzie King at Laurier House.
19. No engagements had been accepted for Sunday, the 20th October. Mr. MacDonald and his party joined their special train at 10-30 p.m. The leave-taking at the station was intended to be quite informal, but a considerable crowd was present to see Mr. Mackenzie King say farewell to the Prime Minister on the platform, and cheers were raised for Mr. MacDonald and Miss MacDonald as the train drew out of the station.20. Mr. P. W. Field, His Majesty&apos;s Senior Trade Commissioner in Canada, accompanied by Mr. G. S. Dixon, of his staff, called on the Prime Minister in the special train at Montreal at 9-30 on the morning of the 21st October, and at 10 o&apos;clock Mr. MacDonald received Mr. Houde, the Mayor of Montreal, the City Clerk, and a delegation of Labour representatives. At 10-30 a.m. the party, who had been joined by Sir Henry Thornton and his son, proceeded by motor-car&apos;to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where I had arranged for a suite of rooms to be available for rest and interviews. The cars were preceded by mounted police and the pipe band of the Royal Highlanders, and the streets between the station and the hotel were lined with enthusiastic crowds. Mr. MacDonald and his party left the hotel at 11-30 a.m. and drove through the principal parts of the city, accompanied by a patrol of motor-cycle police.21. The Prime Minister then proceeded to the Windsor Hotel, and, after receiving forty leading citizens of Montreal, was the guest of the Montreal Canadian Club for luncheon. About 1,600 people were present, and the Prime Minister&apos;s address, of which I enclose copies, was broadcast from the Montreal radio station.*22. At 2-30 p.m. Mr. MacDonald. accompanied by Mr. E. W. Beatty, Chancellor of MeGill University, was drawn in an open carriage to the University by a team of students, amid scenes of riotous enthusiasm. An honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on the Prime Minister, who replied in a speech, of which copies are annexed.* At 3 o&apos;clock these ceremonies were concluded, and the remainder of the afternoon was spent on a visit to the Harbour of Montreal as the guest of Hon. W. McDougald, Chairman of the Montreal Harbour Commission, with whom tea was taken on the yacht of Sir Hugh Allen. In the evening the Prime Minister, Miss MacDonald and Sir Robert Vansittart dined as the guests of Sir Henry and Lady Thornton, and the party left Moreau Street Station by special train at 11-30 p.m. for Chicoutimi.23. The visit to Chicoutimi, which occupied the 22nd and 23rd October, was of a private nature. The Prime Minister and his party made their headquarters on the special train, and visited places of interest in the neighbourhood, under the guidance of Mr. J. E. Dubuc. Liberal member for Chicoutimi in the Federal Parliament, on the morning of the 22nd, and of Colonel John Price, an honorary Aide-de-Camp to His Excellency the Governor-General, on the afternoon of the 22nd and on the 23rd. Both these gentlemen have extensive interests in the development of the district, and were able, therefore, to show the party over a number of power development works and industrial plant in that area. On the 22nd October Mr. Dubuc was host to the Prime Minister and Miss MacDonald and the other members of the party at a luncheon given at his house in Chicoutimi. The special train left with the party for Quebec City at 8-30 p.m. on the 23rd October.24. Arriving at Quebec City, Mr. MacDonald was greeted by Mr. Taschereau, Premier of the Province of Quebec, Colonel Papineau, Aide-de-Camp representing the Lieutenant-Gpvernor of the Province, and Mr. Oscar Auger, Mayor of the City, and drove to Spencerwood, the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor, where he, Miss MacDonald and Sir Robert Vansittart were the guests of the Honourable H. G. Carrol during their stay. Mr. Taschereau entertained Mr. MacDonald to luncheon at the Garrison Club, and, after a motor drive in the afternoon and tea at the house of Lady Price, there was an informal dinner party at Government House.25. Friday, the 26th October, was the last day of the Prime Ministers stay in Canada. At 1 p.m. he delivered his final speech at a joint meeting of the Men&apos;s Canadian Club and the Women&apos;s Canadian Club of Quebec at a luncheon in the Chateau Frontenac Hotel.   The reports of the speech are annexed.*26.. All passengers joining at Quebec a ship which has sailed from Montreal are usually required to travel by tender and board the ship in mid-stream. On this occasion the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company made special arrangements to bring the steamship &quot; Duchess of York &apos;&apos; alongside the quay, and the Prime Minister
was thus able to embark without any inconvenience. The Lieutenant-Governor,. Mr. Taschereau, and other leading men said good-bye to Mr. MacDonald at the quayside, and he.went on board at 8 p.m. On his departure he issued a farewell message to Canada and exchanged messages of farewell with the Governor-General, Mr. Mackenzie King, and Mi\ R. B. Bennett. The text of these messages are enclosed. *27. Throughout the visit the Prime Minister and his party were the guests of the Government of Canada, and were accompanied by Colonel H. J. Coghill, of the Department of National Defence, who made himself responsible for carrying out all detailed arrangements within the framework of the programme provided to him. Special arrangements for the personal safety of the Prime Minister were carried out by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Before and during the visits to Montreal and Toronto I received great assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Senior Trade Commissioner and His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioner respectively in arranging accommodation, transport and numerous details connected with the programme.28. I cannot close this despatch, which must necessarily read as a somewhat bald narrative of events, without attempting to convey some idea of the very deep impression wdiich was made by the Prime Minister during his visit. It is possible that to anyone coming fresh from the scenes of almost unparalleled enthusiasm which were witnessed in the United States, the attitude adopted by Canadians might for the moment appear by comparison over-restrained. Canadians were conscious that this might be so before the Prime Minister crossed into Canada, and this feeling-found a representative expression in the following words which appeared in a leading article in the &quot; Toronto Globe &quot; of the 15th October : If the greeting does not measure up to that accorded on his landing in New York, it will be because this city is somewhat more British in its attitude toward demonstrations and because the ten days&apos; stay in the United States, on wdiich all Canadians have informed themselves fully, has &apos; taken the edge off &apos; to some extent. Canada is also, probably, a little more accustomed to British Premiers.....&quot;29. Canada knows Mr. MacDonald; and the people of Canada feel that they may exercise the privilege not, indeed, of treating him as a &quot; prophet without honour &quot; -nothing would be further from the truth but of treating him when he is in Canada as being &quot; in his own country,&quot; of treating him almost as if he were one of their own statesmen, in whose achievements they may themselves claim the honour of some share. In this sense, a sentence in Mr. MacDonald&apos;s informal speech at Niagara Falls, though it might conceivably lend itself to criticism on a narrow interpretation of its constitutional implications, is essentially true of Canada&apos;s sentiment, both towards Mr. MacDonald himself and towards his mission. I refer to the passage in which he said I am encouraged by cables which I havereceived to believe that I am not only representing Great Britain, but Great Britain and the Dominions.....&quot;30. Since the war, as your Lordship is aware, there has been in Canada a certain distrust of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to peace and disarmament, and a deep-seated apprehension that, in committing herself whole-heartedly to co-operation with Great Britain, Canada might end by seriously impairing those relations with her immensely powerful neighbour, which naturally loom largest in her conceptions of foreign policy. This bugbear, has now, I believe, been removed. Canada, anxious during recent years at the slow march towards a &quot;peace mind,&quot; has found herself outstripped by a partner whose tardiness she has been apt to rebuke. In creating conditions in which Anglo-American rivalries can be deprived of their dangers, the Prime Minister has created conditions in which Canada can, and, I believe, will, cast her own peculiar fears behind her, and may be expected to give a much less hesitant co-operation in all matters of common concern.31.   I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington. r PI have, &amp;c. (Signed) W. H. CLARK.The Right Hon.

APPENDIX.Verbatim Report of the Speech of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the Government Dinner, Ottawa, October 17.(&quot; Ottawa Journal,&quot; October 18, 1929.)Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Bennett, ladies and gentlemen :THIS gathering, together with the honour which the Prime Minister has just announced as being about to be conferred upon me, moves me With the most heartfelt gratitude, and I must try to do my best to express it. One finds that in doing one&apos;s best there are many obstacles to overcome, because unfortunately, when the Creator ceased creating at the end of the seven days, He still left mankind very imperfect.Mr. Bennett was good enough to remind me of my name and my clan. Yes, Mr. Bennett, those of us who have inherited the name MacDonald, have inherited hiany reputations of great variety, and there have been many liftings up. Some of us have attained to Premierships here and elsewhere; a great many of us, by a Divine Providence, have been hanged. Between the wide distinctions of those extremes many MacDonalds have won fame and fortune. I shall just try to do my best now and as long as I live to be ranged amongst those like John A. Macdonald, whose name and memory are held sacred by all parties in the Dominion of Canada.The Prime Minister also had reminiscences and, regarding them, the words of Ossian come to my mind :&apos;&apos; There comes a voice that wakes my soul, &quot; Tis the voice of years that are gone. &quot; They roll before me in all their deeds.&quot;Ah, Mr. Prime Minister, if in those early days in London which you painfully remind me are thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four years distant, I had addressed you as Mr. Prime Minister; if I had addressed Mr. Sidney Webb as Lord Passfield; and if you had addressed me as &quot; the Right Honourable,&quot; we should have been inclined to go to Clarkson, the theatrical wig-maker, in order that we might have adorned ourselves appropriately for the fancy-dress ball that then would have been in our minds. But there is nothing more surprising than the decrees of fate, and here we are, you Prime Minister of Canada, I Prime Minister of Great Britain, Sidney Webb, a member of the House of Lords.What it amounts to is this : We have all to make our own roads, and not only our roads, but the homes which Ave inhabit at the end of our roads. It Avas a great generation, that of ours. It Avas a generation Avhen old things AArere passing aAvay and everything was becoming new. It was a generation Avhich Avas closing a magnificent series of chapters of our national history, and you and I and our friends and colleagues Avho met at 3, Lincoln&apos;s Inn Field and elseAvhere just over a generation ago in London, happened to be born as the beginnings, as the forerunners of the new generation that is noAv in authority of the nations of the Avorld. Recalling those men to my mind very hurriedly, there Avere no feAver than four Prime Ministers and it Avould require the keen and indeed the supernatural eye of a prophet to have detected in any one of us the path that was in front of us.What can I talk to you about to-night in thanking you for drinking so cordially my oavii health, the health of my daughter and the health of those avIio have accompanied me on this mission ? I should like to talk about Canada. I should like to talk about Avhat you have been; I should like to talk about Avhat you are. I should abo\&apos;e everything like to talk to you about the promise that is held in the Avomb of the present regarding this Avonderful country of boundless opportunity. I should like to indulge in daydreams because, as my opponents will tell you and I admit the fault I am a dreamer. No man has &quot;ever done anything Without first of all dreaming about it. All the great achievements of the world are the achievements of men who have been called in their own generation, dreamers. We dream of things and if we are men of action we set about realising our dreams in our waking moments.But I will leave that. I crossed the ocean the other day in order to bear a message of goodAvill to the nation south of the border, to try to strengthen the goodAvill betAveen our people and theirs, and Avhen I had done what I could, in the
brief days that were at my disposal, because the call to return is very imperative and pressing, I could not go back until I paid a family visit to you and to Canada on my way home.I came to you last year as the leader of the Opposition enjoying all the freedom that Mr. Bennett now enjoys, enjoying all the enmities that are never deeper than the surface, that Mr. Bennett now enjoys. I return to you this year as the Prime Minister of Great Britain. We are all of a family. Sometimes little troubles arise between us, but they are family troubles and when the other day we signed the Optional Clause at Geneva, we signed it along with the proclamation made to the whole world that the Commonwealth of British Nations was a family and by a family court and a family arrangement we should settle our differences. I sometimes tremble, however, when I think how easy it is for a slip of the tongue or a slip of the pen to create differences between us. In a very pleasing conversation which I had with the Prime Minister this afternoon he warned me that I should not use certain expressions which, unfortunately, I habitually use.But I want to say this to you, members of the Privy Council of Canada, members of the Government, members of late Governments of Canada, and I beg of you to believe it, whatever the slips of my tongue or pen or of the tongues or pens of my colleagues may be, that we understand and we value this strange community of self-governing nations held together by nothing more than a common reverence for common traditions, a common pride in a great human stock, held together by nothing more than a common allegiance to a Crown which symbolizes our unity. In spite of slips about &quot;our Dominions&quot; or &quot;our Colonies,&quot; we never mean anything more than this : That you and we are a common family and in all our political relations, in all the expressions of those relations, the Government of Great Britain, the government centred in London, will observe, if not always to the letter, certainly always to the spirit, the constitu-tion of this most wonderful experiment in common government of independent peoples and independently constituted human minds.I went to the United States, not to negotiate an agreement to negotiate an agreement is a long process-1 went to strengthen and to establish goodwill. I went to try to create the conditions under which we could discuss great historical problems, with the hope, nay, almost with the certainty, that as a result .of these discussions we should come to an agreement. Agreements are of no value whatever if they are merely temporary agreements, agreements on paper. The kind of an agreement that is to keep the world in peace must be made only after common confidence has been established between the peoples who make the agreement. An agreement which is not the embodiment of confidence is one of those scraps of paper which are torn up when convenience necessitates the tearing of them. What we have to establish in the world now is not merely a great series of treaties of arbitration, but an understanding between each other a knowledge of tradition, a knowledge of temperament, and a capacity to put ourselves in each other&apos;s shoes, such an intimate knowledge of the points of view from which various people look upon the world. What we need is such a knowledge as will enable us, when we sit down alongside of the representatives of other peoples, to exchange views, not as people living in different continents and different atmospheres, but as people having an understanding which, in the nature of things, shall be more than the result of clever and acute diplomacy. That is the problem which the Avorld demands the statesmen of to-day to solve in order that the generations of the future may live and rest in peace.The most fundamental thing Ave have to keep in mind at this moment is this. You have signed a Pact of Peace. And when I say you I mean Canada. In the eyes of the Avorld you have sent your own Prime Minister, Avho is here to-night, to Paris to sign his name to a document as your representative. He is your trustee. His name attached to that document is j^our name, and through him you have solemnly declared that in the future all consideration of Avar shall be banished from your national policy^ We have done the same, France has done the same, Italy has done the same, and the United States have done the same. Is our signature a mere scraAvl in ink upon a perishable document, or has that subscription entered into and become an essential part of our national honour? I confess to you, my friends, that mine is the latter view. The signature of Canada, of Australia, of Great Britain, the Mother Land, put to that Pact of Peace has noAv become part and parcel of the national honour, Avhich is so sacred to us that we are prepared to sacrifice ourselves in order to make it good. When I see the name of Great Britain put at the end of a document my eyes&quot;behold a sacred instrument.  And Avhat are we doing
now ? Nothing more than carrying out our national honour. We say that there is to be no more war. Are we at liberty to turn from that declaration and then say, &quot;but lest there should be war we are going to do certain things? &quot; I say Ave are not. The great curse that has been upon the nations of the world has taken this form that the good men and women have always spoken righteousness and the worldly-Avise have always refused to recognise it. We have been pious beyond words and Ave have never had the courage to carry our pieties into action. The moment has come for us to be courageous in our good professions.The problem, as Mr. Bennett has truly said, is the problem of the physician. If I were as eloquent as Demosthenes I could never tell you hoAv tired I am of mere piety. We go to church on Sunday every week and Ave are very good Avhilst we arc there; and as soon as Ave go home we disrobe ourselves of our goodness as we disrobe ourselves of our Sunday best, and we get up on Monday morning different not only in our feelings, but in our mentality. There was in the village I come from an old boy Avho Avas a very devout Catholic. The nearest chapel was 6 miles from the village and in order to worship he had to hire a trap, as we called it then it Avas before the days of motor cars. It cost him 6s., and being a Scotsman he was a thrifty man. His religion compelled him to spend 6s. a week to drive himself from Lossiemouth to Elgin, But his desire to get value for his money compelled him to commit the sin of drunkenness on Saturday, in order that he might have some reason to go and intervieAv the priest and get absolution next morning.The great problem Ave have to face is the problem of the transition time, the transition time which lies between the military mentality and peace security. Supposing next Aveek Ave were going to decree a general disarmament, and those of us of vision could, simply by a stroke of the pen, stop everything in the nature of protection; would that benefit the Avorld ? It Avould not. We have to lead the world gently across its difficulties; Ave have to give it confidence as we lead it. If in the midst of the stepping stones the people whose hands we grasp, in order to help them over, got into a panic, they Avould fall into the water and our Avork Avould be undone. They Avould not rush in a panic across; they Avould rush in a panic back, and we should have to follow them back and begin all over again the process of inducing them to go forAvard. I do not want to Avaste my life. I do not Avaht to Avaste my remaining years. This generation does not Avant to Avaste its remaining years. This generation has therefore the problem placed before it, hoAv, holding to the &quot;is&quot; which Ave Avant to change and turning our faces to the &quot;to be &quot; to which avc Avish to attain, we shall go gently across, keeping the torches overhead, confident and secure in mind, until at. last the transition time is past and we can smile at one another on the other side Avhere real security and real peace are to be enjoyed.The practical problem is therefore hoAv to combine business sagacity, business ability, and business definiteness and precision of thought with the idealism Avhich, as Mr. Bennett has shown, has always been the inspiration of the great minds of past ages. That is what we Want to do. And Avhen Ave look round about us to discover how best that can be done, what better example can Ave get, as the Prime Minister has said, than certain chapters in Canadian history? Your Prime Minister has referred to that wonderful treaty made after the Avar of 1812, the Rush-Bagot treaty. Did you notice the significance of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement ? There Ave see an agree-ment with regard to the tonnage of four vessels with one gun of a certain calibre each. What have I been talking about all these months since I came into office ? There is nothing neAV under the sun, and if the United States Avere to raise any problems about Canada, any problems about cruisers, any problems about fortifications-tions, any problems about the calibre of guns, could wisdom go higher than this  to direct my thoughts back to this treaty, to bring it up to date, and to suggest to my friend, who is chairman to-night, that he renew that treaty Avith the United States for the next century ?Why have you peace? Why are there not eight-inch gun cruisers on the lakes? Why have you no great battleship harbours on the lakes ? Because shortly after the Avar of 1812 you came to an agreement; and having come to an agreement, competitive building Avas stopped. And competitive building having stopped you never put upon your lakes a Avarship above this treaty standard. The result is. having done that, that you have forgotten altogether about the treaty as a practical piece of politics, because the treaty abolished the conditions under which it became important. I thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister; I Avill not forget that part of your speech during the next few months while the negotiations are going on.
During the summer months we have been discussing the question. We have not come to an absolute agreement, and for a very simple reason. The United States and ourselves-and when I say ourselves I mean Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the Irish Free State, Great Britain and-Northern Ireland, and I mean our family, our community, our commonwealth, &quot;our&quot; not in the possessive sense emphasized in London, but &quot; our &quot; emphasized by all of us and including all of us the United States and ourselves, I say, have been discussing this question but have come to no definite Conclusions. And why? Because the world is not the United States plus ourselves. If the world Avere the United States plus ourselves we should have come to an agreement at the end of June, we should have come to an agreement a week after we started negotiations. But there is a world outside the United States and ourselves, and we do not want to impose our will upon the world outside. That is not the Avay to get peace. The best of families are the families in which neither husband nor wife can tell which is superior, and that homely example of practical co-operation and sound democracy we have to apply to all our world dealings. What we have to do is to come so near to an agreement, and to get into such an under-standing frame of mind, that Ave can say, &quot;now let us bring in the rest of the world.&quot; Our disagreement will not make for a Avorld agreement, but What has been achieved since we began our negotiations in June. When it was decided that we should call what has come to be known as the five-power conference, a great many of my friends were pessimistic, they advised me not to call that conference because, as they said, there Avere other powers that ought to be there, but Avould not be there they Avould not accept the invitation. I was never pessimistic. I said, &quot; I am perfectly sure that if that conference is called every power asked to be present will accept the invitation.&quot; I am very glad to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that every power that Avas requested to send representatives there has now replied that it will be happy to be represented, and so the next stage in this dream is the five-poAver conference, and I go back to London to begin conversations with France, with Italy, with Japan, in the same frank and free and open way that has characterized the conversations between the United States and ourselves. And I hope and pray, indeed I believe, that Ave shall have the support of the rest of the world all the time and that as a result of these informal conversations, when we shall attempt to understand each other, an agreement will come some time next spring, Avhich will be the biggest and most substantial advance towards world peace Avhich has been known- in the history of civilization up to the present time.That is Avhat has been done during those days, and during all those conversa-tions, Canada will be informed, Australia Avill be informed, and the other Dominions Avill be informed, and if any nation, not engaged in those conversations, would like to be informed, whether they have a navy small or great, or no navy at all, all they have to do is to tell us that they would like to be informed and they will be informed, because the method of the United States and ourselves has been up to now and will continue to be the living of the open life. We have lifted up the Avindows of our diplomatic offices; we have pulled up the blinds; we have drawn aside the screens. Everything we do, we Avant the world to know because in this case knowledge is support and knowledge is security.That,&quot; Mr. Prime Minister and members of the Privy Council, is what is in our minds. That, I think, is what is in the minds of President Hoover and his Government. When we have gone thus far, do we not notice that old historical problems and difficulties assume a new meaning; that some of them disappear altogether ?  If there is to be no Avar, there is to be no blockade.  What is the use ofIbothering ourselves and wasting our time considering problems that will arise out of a blockade when we have declared that there is going to be no blockade at all? What Ave have rather to do is to sit down quietly in our departmental offices or at our own firesides and consider how it is that a sentence of clear English, declaring a new relationship, has completely revolutionized the problems of the world because that is Avhat has happened.- If during this transition time, when we are trying to lead the people across from the land of war to the land of peace, conversations and discussions are asked for about some of the old historical problems, so far as we are concerned we are prepared to enter into them. But the great fundamental and unshiftable fact is this : that if Ave mean what Ave say and I do and Great Britain does problem after problem that has created strife and difficulty and actually has produced Avar, has been charmed into a mere grey shadoAv possessing no longer any substance. That is the wonderful change that is taking place in these days and that Avill be fixed in the
world and in the policy of states if we have the courage to pursue the vision, not only as idealists or dreamers, but as hard-headed, practical business men.That is all I have to say in explanation of the Work the British Government at the present moment has in hand. In doing it, what honours have we received; what welcomes have we not had; what gratitude inexpressible has risen up in our hearts! And to-night, around this family board, meeting men and women of my own people, of my own allegiance, of my own kith and kin, honoured by being made a member of the same distinguished body as you belong to, I feel as though those honours and those distinctions have reached a magnificent climax.I put in this plea : It is not well for man to go straight from his workshop to his grave. I hope that your kindness will not contribute towards depriving me of some years of leisure as a spectator when I shall have laid aside my responsibilities and handed them over to younger and fresher minds. Your kindness has always been like that of the penguin which stifles its young on account of its maternal love. I put in a plea that your kindness may be limited; that your feasting may be restricted; that your goodness of heart may be tempered by charity to the delighted victim of your generosity. I want to go back; I want to finish the work; I want to be able, simply as a spectator, to look upon other people bringing it nearer and nearer to a successful conclusion.But if those days are spared to me, often and often, again and again, shall I go back in memory to those great days from the time I landed in New York until the time when I shall have departed from Quebec homewards again. They will give me great happiness; the living over again of them will be as delightful as the living of them now, ancl I will remember this meeting, this breaking of bread with you, your greeting, your enthusiasm, and occasionally a sly laugh will arise in my mind when across that mind will pass once more the words of the chairman to-night, recalling to me the days that we spent together: Mr. Mackenzie King, a student, an inquirer; Mr. Sidney Webb, known merely as a queer creature with odd notions, and myself, never dreaming of anything except a continuation of the privileges that I had of being able to open my door and invite many strangers to come in and &quot;exchange views in my room. It will be a strange mingling of satisfaction and surprise and it will all centre around those wonderful days, that; alas! are coming to an end.I thank you, Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. Bennett, for the kind words you have spoken, and I thank the guests very much for the enthusiasm with which they have received those words.o
