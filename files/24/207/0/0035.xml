THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT. Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.     35&quot; &quot; TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.CP. 344 (29).It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.THE GROWTH OF EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.WITH reference to the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memorandum covering the Report on Retirement Pensions,* I circulate a note on the growth of expenditure.Concerning the scheme for Retirement Pensions, I confine myself for the moment to this observation. It puts 390,000 people permanently out of work. Even on the assumptions made by the authors, it provides work for only 280,000 substitutes. The 390,000 will be paid at a rather higher rate than the 280,000 have been paid, and out of a rather different fund, viz., a pensions fund instead of the Unemployment Fund. The main financial difference is that the whole cost will fall upon the Exchequer.P. S.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, November 29, 1929.Growth of Expenditure.1. The annexed Table gives in round figures the main items, roughly estimated, of increases of expenditure over the next three years under commitments already entered into.2. The main item among the obligations due to previous Governments is the excess cost of the Block Grant under the Local Government Act over the yield of the Petrol Duty. In 1930 it is  17^ millions, and it declines a little in 1931 and 1932 with the growth, in the yield of the Petrol Duty, and as a result of some small gains under the head of Income Tax Schedule D which arise from the de-rating scheme. The late Government diverted the Budget surpluses of 1927 and 1928 from their proper purpose of debt redemption and paid them into what was called a Suspensory Fund, to assist in defraying the cost of de-rating in its early years. This Fund would meet the cost in 1930, with a small balance over towards 1931 and nothing towards 1932. It is little more than a paper device to make Budgets look better. The Fund was invested long since in short-term advances to the Govern-ment. Before it can be used it must be reconverted to cash, and in doing that we increase our floating debt to outsiders in just the same way as though there were a[20218]* See CP. 341 (29).
Budget deficit. However, the existence of the Fund will enable the Opposition to claim that any considerable increase in expenditure in 1930 is not their doing.The net total of inherited obligations, including a conservative estimate of the normal growth of Civil Estimates, is  4 millions in 1930,  18 millions in 1931 and  20 millions in 1932.3. Further very substantial commitments have already been made by the present Government; it is thought that the figures are, if anything, understated. For instance, in the absence of any precise estimates, only nominal amounts have been inserted in respect of the development works promoted by the Lord Privy Seal. The expenditure is certain to be greater than these figures, and it would be very much greater if, for example, the Central Government were itself to undertake works, as advocated by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, or if further road pro-grammes exceeding the annual income of the Road Fund were to be embarked upon  and I understand that the Ministry of Transport are, in fact, increasing their programme of road expenditure.The main commitments so far represent increases of State expenditure on the Social Services. The additional obligations, rising in a full year to  12 millions a year in respect of Unemployment Insurance, do little more than continue to existing beneficiaries their present benefits. The expenditure (in part necessitated by the failure of the late Government to maintain the solvency of the Fund) does very little to improve the position of the unemployed or their capacity to obtain remunerative employment. The expenditure on Widows&apos; Pensions, starting at  5 millions and increasing, will help to relieve hardships and anomalies, but it will not increase the production of wealth. The raising of the School Leaving Age will, for the moment at least, actually reduce it. The cost of this scheme to the Exchequer (apart from the Rates) I must estimate, after taking account of maintenance allowances, at certainly not less than  1 - 5 millions in 1931 and  3 millions in 1932.No addition is made for any proposals for expenditure which may arise out of any special scheme for Retirement Pensions at 60, or out of the comprehensive review recently instituted by the Cabinet of the arrangements for dealing with the Able-bodied Poor and of the existing Pension and Health and Unemployment Insurance systems or further proposals which may be put forward to assist Agriculture. The scheme of Retirement Pensions would cost the Exchequer  21-6 millions in 1930,  19-3 millions in 1931 and  16-8 millions in 1932. Very large sums, running to many millions a year, are involved or have been suggested from time to time for the other purposes mentioned.Most of this expenditure, present or proposed, is mainly designed to secure a more equitable distribution of wealth. But on the whole it makes considerable sections of the community more dependent upon the exertions of others and for the most part it does not promote an increasing production of wealth, upon which any general improvement of the standard of living ultimately depends. Indeed, the danger is that, by raising costs of production, it may actually diminish the output of industry.4. Adding our own definite commitments to inherited obligations we have to find  24 millions in 1930,  42 millions in 1931 and  49 millions in 1932. To these figures it will certainly be necessary to add an increase of  5 millions in each year for the Fixed Debt Charge, which was put at too low a figure by the late Government. As regards the Fighting Services, the proposals so far put before me by the Ministers responsible do not, taking them together, represent any reduction on the estimates of the current year. Thus the figures are increased to  29 millions in 1930,  47 millions in 1931 and  54 millions in 1932.5. I now come to revenue. It is not possible to count very much on an increase in the yield of existing sources of revenue. On the contrary, there are indications that the results of 1930 may be as much as  5 millions below 1929. I must, on present information, increase the  29 millions required for 1930 to  34 millions. Some recovery in 1931 and 1932 is possible, but it is unlikely that in either year the yield from existing sources will rise substantially above 1929. The Hague Settlement, though it prevented an unjustified reduction in our reparation receipts, will still leave us some  3 millions below the very high figure we had reached under the Dawes Plan.   Other heads of miscellaneous revenue are nearing extinction.
The consumption of Alcohol is declining. These causes go far to offset any natural growth in Inland Revenue.Moreover we are pledged to repeal food taxes and protective duties, which at present produce If I omit silk and entertainments duties (which would add another  12 millions to these figures), and if I assume by way of illustration that the pledge is met to the extent of one-half next year and no more in the two ensuing years, then on present indications, and to meet only these items to which we are committed up to now, new taxes will be required to produce  45 millions in 1930, nearly  60 millions in 1931 and  65 millions in 1932. This is quite apart from the scheme of Retirement Pensions, which, were it adopted, would raise the figures to  67 millions in 1930,  77 millions in 1931 and over  80 millions in 1932.6. Figures of this size are impressive and depressing. It must be remembered that we cannot count on more than about half, or perhaps two-thirds, of a full year&apos;s yield of new or increased direct taxation in the year of imposition. Land Taxes, for instance, will yield no appreciable sum for two or three years after their imposition. Moderate increases of Super-tax and Death Duties will make only a modest contribution to the need. Fleavy increases on the top of the existing scales, apart from the fact that they may have unexpected and unwelcome economic consequences, are apt to defeat their own object since, while some forms of legal evasion can be combated, others cannot. A tax on investment income (which is only an addition to Income Tax and Super-tax on one class of income) must be investigated. But it has severe limitations : I have indicated one of them. A substantial increase in the general rate of Income Tax, falling proportionately on all who pay that tax, would of course be a fruitful source of revenue, but it would also be a substantial burden upon the middle classes. My colleagues will be able to judge of the political expediency of any such, course.I confine myself to painting the picture a picture which is becoming progressively gloomier as we add still more to our existing commitments. The final solution of the problem must wait for a later stage in the financial year, but it is already fully apparent what a struggle it will be.Food Taxes ...
