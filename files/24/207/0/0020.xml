AND DRAINAGE BILL. - RATING PROVISIONS.Oopy IToMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.In accordance with Cabinet 31(29), Conclusion 4, theattached report has been prepared by the Committee appointed to consider the difficulties in carrying out the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Land Drainage, occasioned by the derating provisions of the Local Government Act, 1929.The Committee&apos;s recommendations may be summarised asfollows:-1. The Committee see no difference between regarding mainriver drainage as a service and any other service for which rates have to be levied, and they recommend, therefore, that the proposed Catchment Area Authorities should precept for part of their revenue on the County and County Borough Councils, who will raise the sums required in the same way as they raise their other rates. Agricultural land would thus escape paying altogether, and factories would only pay one quarter rates.2. The Committee recommend that, in addition, the CatchmentArea Authorities should levy, by precept on the Internal Drainage Authorities, a benefit rate on the lowland portion of their district. Where any portion of this area is not under an Internal Authority, the Catchment Area Authority should have power to set one up.    The Internal Authority would collect these rates together with their own internal rates, and would continue to levy their rates on acreage or annual value at their own discretion, as at present.3. The Committee contemplate that it will be neoessary forsome limit to be fixed to the amount that can be raised by means of Rate (1) and Rate (2) above.4. The Committee recommend that. If Rate (2) is levied1.
PI        ^aj-f Pi emumul value, agricultural land should he taken fat  fa, full value, railways at the value of the land on either side, and other hereditaments at one third their value, this heing the practice now adopted.    Ifj on the other hand, Rate (2) is levied on the basis of acreage, the Internal Authority should be empowered to levy its rates on hereditaments other than agricultural land at some suitable proportion of the acreage charge in the pound.5. The Committee recommend that where an InternalAuthority has to levy rates,  either&apos; for its own purposes or as the result of a precept by the Catchment Area Authority,  on an urban area( it should be permissible for an arrangement to he made under which the Urban Authority would pay to the Internal Drainage Authority a sum equivalent to that which the latter would raise by rating the urban area.    Although this would mean that agricultural land and factories within such urban area would obtain the relief afforded by the Local Government Act, 1929, the amount at stake would be small, compared with the simplification which would be effected.6. Xhe Committee observe that the general Rate (l) above will oonstitute a new rate within the meaning of Section 135 of the Local Government Act,  19 29, and local authorities will no doubt raise the question of some contribution being made by the Exchequer towards the new burden, which is not likely to he large.I consider that the Committee have reached a reasonable solution of the difficulties that have arisen, and I hope my colleagues will accept their recommendations in order that the Parliamentary Draftsman may be instructed to draft the rating clauses of the General Land Drainage Bill, upon which he is now engaged.(Itld.)   N.B.try of Agriculture and Fisheries. 22nd November, 1929.
LAND DRAINAGE -The Basis of Rating.1.    On 26th July,1929, the Cabinet decided &quot;that representatives of the Treasury, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries should, meet to consider the various alternatives for overcoming the difficulties in carrying out the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Land Drainage, 1927, occasioned by the complete derating of agricultural land under the Local Government Act, 1929, with a view to reaching agreement upon the most satisfactory solution.&quot;2.    A Committee was accordingly constituted as follows:-(1)    Sir Alfred Hurst,K.B.3., C.B., H.M. Treasury, (2)    Mr. A.T.A. Dobson, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. (3)    Mr. H.H. George,M.C.,Ministry of Health. They submit the following report to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.3.    Under the present law of Land Drainage, drainage rates may be levied either upon acreage or upon some form of Annual Value, not specified, at the discretion of the Authority,    But all rating for drainage purposeswhether assessed according to acreage or annual value, has rested on the principle of payment for benefit received and in consequence land well above flood level and most urban areas have been entirely exempted, with the result that - in the words of the Royal Commission - &quot;in a great majority of cases Drainage Authorities have wholly inadequate areas over which they may levy rates for carrying out necessary works.&quot;
41     The QoirmlssilQJi accordingly recommended the whole responsibility for drainage works on the main channel of any important river should be placed in the hands of a new authority representative of all the county or county borough councils An the catchment area of that river and raising its funds by rates levied over the whole area,  subject to such differential rating between lowland and upland areas as might be approved by the Minister.5.     All Internal Drainage Authorities, including additional ones to be created by the Catchment Area Authority, were, under the supervision of that Authority, to be responsible for the drainage works in their own areas, other than the maintenance of the main channel, charging the cost over the area benefited,  subject to such contributions as might be mado, by the Catchment Area Authority, at its discretion.6.      It will be seen,  therefore,   that two distinct methods of charge are involved in the Royal Commission&apos;s recommendation -(1)    A charge on internal drainage areas xn respect of direct benefit or betterment resulting either from works^ oarried out by the minor authorities or from the more extensive, schemes of the catchment Area Authority.(2)    A general charge over the whole catchment area ef such part of the cost of drainage works as is not met under the benefit levy.    This would consist of such part of the expenditure of the Catchment Area Authority as was not levied by precept on the internal drainage authorities and in addition such contributions as this authority might see fit to make towards works carried out by the minor authorities.General Drainage Charges over the Catchment Area. 7.      The Royal Commission endeavoured to represent their
1 1 rDrGOorrimendat^W for bringing upland and urban areas under levy to help in bearing the liability hitherto resting solely on the lowland areas, i.e., the second charge above, as a logical development of the principle of payment according to benefit,J&quot;but their line of argument is open to criticism in its detailed application.    For example, whereas in the lowland areas the benefit from drainage works is to be measured in the case of agricultural land by full annual value while urban property is to contribute to the internal drainage rate on an arbitrarily reduced proportion of annual rating, or not at all, the benefit derived by upland areas from drainage works is deemed to be proportionate to one-fourth annual value for agricultural land and to full annual value for urban property. This no doubt followed the then existing practice under which Agricultural land was only assessed on one fourth, but the Committee consider that a sounder presentation of the Royal Commission&apos;s proposals would be that areas drawing direct benefit or betterment from drainage works should bo specially assessed in respect of that benefit or betterment, and that such part of the cost of drainage works as cannot reasonably be met in this way should be accepted as a general rate burden over the whole area of the river basin on the broad ground of the community of interest of the whole population of the basin in tho proper maintenance of its river system.8.     The position appears to&quot;be closely analogous to that frequently found in regard to public water supply.    Such part of the cost as can reasonably be levied on consumers is raised by direct charge dependent on consumption, either measured accurately by meter or roughly estimated from the size amd equipment of the house, and the balance is raised by &apos; general rating over the whole area of the authority on the3.
ground that the entire population is interested in the maintenance of an adequate water supply.9.      The same principle is followed in regard to many other local government scrvicos in respect of which, direct benefit&quot; charges are levied.    Housing, Small-holdings, Gemeteries, Tramways, Pleasure Grounds, Bathing Places, Higher Education, Health. Institutions, Lunatic Asylums;    in regard to all these, charges are made in respect of direct benefit and in a high proportion of cases a balance of cost remains to bo met by the general ratepayer.    In the further case of highways, the benefit charge is limited to motor and hackney vehicles and to privato carriages and is levied by the State, the proceeds reaching the local authority in the form of grants, but the principle is the same.10.    The basis of these charges on the general community has always been rateable value,  subjeot to special allowance in certain cases in favour of suoh properties as agricultural land and railway lines.    By the Local Government Aot of 1929, the aosessability of Agricultural land and&apos; buildings which had previously been reduced to one-fourth of full rateable value was abolished altogether, and that of certain categories of industrial property was reduced to one-fourth.    The Committee need not enter into the economic grounds for this relief of industry.    It is sufficient to note that it has definitely established a new basis of rating on which all new burdens upon the general community will fall to be allocated among the ratepayers.    The Committee can see no ground for differentiating in this matter between the general drainage charge to be imposed on the whole of a catchment area and any of the other local government charges referred to above.4.
117 11sSpecial Drainage Charges jjver Inland Dis tr 1 ct a .11. Drainage charges levied over inland drainage districtsare, however, on an entirely different footing.      Such charges are based on benefit received and in such benefits agricultural land shares of course in a high degree.      Whatever expediency may dictate, there is no ground of principle why the alterations in the basis of rateable value made in the Local Government Act should in any way affect the distribution of inland drainage charges among the benefiting parties.      As a matter of fact the basis of charge of such drainage rates has never in terms been related to rateable value.      In a high proportion of cases acreage h3S beers adopted and where the alternative of annual value has prevailed,  it has in the  rural areas- usually been full annual value irrespective of any reduction given under agricultural Kates Acts and similar legislation in respect of general rate burdens.12.        In the desire to achieve a high degree of uniformity in rating, the Royal Commission recommended that all inland drainage rates (as well as the more general charge) should in future be based upon rateable value, but in view of the predominance of the acreage basis in present practice and the a priori fairness of that basis as a measure of benefit, the Committee are in favour of continuing the present discretion of internal drainage authorities to adopt either acreage or annual value as the basis of charge *13.       But whichever basis is adopted, some greater degree of uniformity might with advantage be introduced into the present practice.      In many of the Drainage Orders made by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries it is laid down that, where a Drainage Authority adopts annual value as the basis of5.
its -rating;, agricultural land shall he rated on its full value, railways shall be rated on the annual value of the land on either side bl&quot; the railway, and other hereditaments shall be rated on the basis of one-third of their annual value.     This might be adopted as  he normal method of procedure.14.       &apos;A&apos;here a Drainage Authority levies its rates on the basis of acreage, it should be empowered to levy its rates on hereditaments other than agricultural land on a proportion of the acreage charge in the pound.     The Committee do not feel competent to lay down any hard and fast rule as to what this proportion should be, but they observe that in the Ouse Drainage Order, 1920, which was drafted by Mr. Ilonstam, R.C., an eminent rating authority who was then in charge of the Ministry&apos;s Land Drainage Department, it is provided that where the Ouse Board levy an acreage rate, say, for example, 2/- per acre, the rate leviable in the case of hereditaments other than agricultural land shall be two-ninths of 2/- in the pound.15.       The foregoing observations and recommendations relate primarily to the S-ural portions of internal drainage districts.      It is only exceptionally that urban areas have been included hitherto, but the Royal Commission coriemplated a v/ider extension of this practice.     Where as internal authority comprises within its area a certain amount of urban property it should be permissible for it to ma Ice arrangements with the rating authority to pay to it a sum of money equivalent to the amount which the drainage authority would levy in the urban area, rather than that it should collect this amount itself in the urban area.     The Committee fully realise that in this case the urban authority; In levying the amount of its contribution, would only levy on factories to the extent of one-quarter of their annual value, and that any agricultural land within the urban boundary would escape contribution.     The amount at stake In such cases would, however, be very small and the Committee feel   that this arrangement would be justified by the great simplification which it would effect.
A 11 ooat,5.on of charges, the; fo&amp;tween the Internal prglri^reJKaieg tfiJT General Rate &quot;over^ the16.     It will be seen from the above that a question of apportionment of the cost of drainage works between the area directly benefited and the whole catchment area will arise in two types of cases -(1) where the work la carried out by the Catchment Area Authority and it desires to charge part of the cost to an internal drainage authority.(2) where the work is carried out by the minor authority and the question is one of the contribution to be made towards it by the major authority.17.     The circumstances of the different river basins vary so widely that no rules of general application can be laid down to decide these questions.   The Royal Commission came to the conclusion that these matters should be within the discretion of the Catchment Area Authority subject to appeal in certain cases to the Minister.    No change in this recommendation is called for in consequence of the. Local Government Act, but the Committee feel that in the early years of the scheme and until general principles as to the division of the charge have been evolved, it will be necessary to give the Ministry an overriding authority in all auch matters.It will be further necessary in any Bill to decide how the respective total sums to be provided by County Counoils and County Borough Councils as the result of the precept of the Catchment Area Authority, are to be determined, and whether the sums so determined are to be spread over the whole of the area of the County Council or County Borough, or only over that portion of the area which is comprised within the catchment area.   The Royal Commission were divided upon this latter point, but aa to the former It would probably be desirable to
calculate the Council^ indebtedness on the basis of the annual value of that portion of the County within the catchment area.Machinery of Collection.18. (feneral Drainage charges spread over the whole catchment area should be met by precept on the County and County Borough Councils.19.     Internal drainage charges, except in so far as they are accepted aa a general liability by urban authorities under the arrangements mentioned in paragraph 15 above should continue to be levied directly by the Internal Drainage Authority,  just as direct charges for water supply are commonly levied at the present time where the supplying authority or company is not the rating authority.20.     Special benefit Drainage rates in respect of the Catchment Area Authority&apos;s operations, and leviable over the lowland area, should be collected,  on precept, by the Internal Authorities, together with their own internal rates as in paragraph 19.   Where there is an area of lowland under no internal Authority, the Royal Commission contemplated that one would be created by the Catchment Area Authority, or that the area in question would be added to the area of some existing Internal Authority.Exchequer Grant-a .21.      Inasmuch as the general drainage charge over the catchment area under the proposals of the Royal Commission will constitute a new rate service within the meaning of Section 135 of the Local Government Act, 1929, local authorities will no doubt raise the question of some contribution being made by the Exchequer towards the na? burden so Imposed,    On any revision of the General Exchequer Contribution under the Act, any increase of rate-borne expenditure resulting from these drainage charges will, of course, enter into the calculation of the General Exchequer
-4 O A\       *Contribution, for&apos; the ensuing fixed grant period and this will seoure that a part of the expenditure is thrown upon the Exchequer at least as great as that which would have fallen on the rateable property relieved under the Act .22.     Except in so far as an increase of expenditure from, a new service may occur within a fixed grant period -and this is not likely to be serious in the case of general drainage rates - this section would appear to mean that the Block Grant set up under the Local Government Act is not to be held to cover hew services for which special Exchequer grants would otherwise have been provided .   The Committee feel therefore that the question of Exchequer contribution towards drainage works should, be dealt with on its merits quite apart from the Block Grant under the recent Act ,A.U.HURST.
