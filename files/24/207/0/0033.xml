Copy No .      3bCABINET.fc.P.342(29).THE SCOTTISH COALFIELDS DISTRESS EUND,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.In view of the Memorandum by the Treasury dated 20th November, 1929,  (C.P.326/29), as to the Coalfields1 Distress Bind, I herewith submit for consideration the following Memorandum as to the position in Scotland.Owing to the serious distress in the coalfields the Central Committee in charge of the Soottish Eund, unlike the Committee in charge of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Eund in England, were unable to suspend its operation during the summer months.     The result therefore has been that tho wholo of the money available to Scotland, with the exception of a balance of  10,000, which includes a sum of  5,000, retained by the Central Committee to meet any undisclosed liabilities, was distributed to the Looal Concaittees by about the end of August and payments to beneficiaries ceased on 13th September last.The total amount of the Eund was  237,980.13/- made up.as followsContributions from charitable sources.  118,794.19. 4. Government Grant. ^ 118,291. 0* 0. Interest, _894.13. 8. 257.980.13. 0.Since September representations have been made to me by the National Union of Scottish Mineworkers, by a number of bodies in Lanarkshire, which is probably the most depressed aroa, and by representative persons in other areas, asking that further money should be provided for meeting the distress this winter.     Such money, I fear, would have to be provided by the Exchequer as I think it highly improbable that another appeal to the Scottish public for further subscriptions to assiBt distress in the mining areas would meet with any degree of sucoess.So far as distress in the Scottish coalfields is concerned, I am of opinion that it is likely to be similar to what it was last winter and that if it is to be met a Bum of at least  100,000 will be necessary to tide the mining community over the next five months.I attach herewith a table of unemployment figures for I distressed mining areas in Scotland.TOt.
