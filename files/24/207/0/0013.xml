Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.     75965-B.(Also Paper No. CCS. 203.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.PROPOSALS FOR THE MECHANIZATION OF NATIVE UNITS INTHE COLONIES, &amp;c.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 964-B.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.WE have been instructed by the Prime Minister to submit our views on the attached Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Committee (C.I.D. Paper No.964-B*), in which it is suggested that a definite policy should be formulated with regard to the mechanization of native troops in the Colonies, &amp;c, especially in those territories depending for securit)^ on aircraft supplemented by local forces.2. The question has arisen owing to a proposal that two Carden-Loyd armoured vehicles should be supplied to Trans-Jordan for trial with a view to the eventual mechanization of the Trans-Jordan Camel Company. It is also reported that suggestions have been made for the supply of two Carden-Loyds to the King&apos;s African Rifles as a first step towards the partial mechanization of that force. The local forces, both in Trans-Jordan and in the East African Colonies, consist entirely of native units with small numbers of British officers and non-commissioned officers.3. We propose to deal only with the question of principle as to whether armoured fighting vehicles of the latest type should be supplied to native units where they would be entirely or partially manned by native personnel.4. Since the Indian Mutiny it has been the policy to keep powerful modern weapons of the latest type out of the hands of native troops who might use them against us. In accordance with this policy field guns have been kept from the Indian Army. Other modern weapons of less power have, however, been handled by Indian units, and the present situation in India, where more than anywhere else we are vitally concerned with this question, is briefly as follows :  The only Field Artillery units are British; part of the Pack Artillery is manned by Indians under British officers; Indian infantry battalions are equipped with machine guns, but on a lower scale than British infantry units.5. In the Egyptian Army there is no artillery nor machine guns, except in the units of the Frontier District Administration, which are under the executive command of British officers. Sudanese units under British officers are equipped with machine guns under British officers. The King&apos;s African Rifles and the Royal West African Frontier Force, which have British officers and a proportion of white non-commissioned officers, are provided with machine guns. The King&apos;s African Rifles are also in possession of lorries and six-wheeled motor vehicles. The Iraq Army, however, already possesses field guns and motor machine guns, and will shortly have armoured cars.6. The present situation, then, is that whilst certain modern weapons, such as machine guns and pack artillery, have been given to native units with British officers, and no objection has been raised to unarmoured mechanized vehicles being handled by native personnel, the manning by them of Field Artillery and of armoured fighting vehicles has not been permitted, except in Iraq.* Also Paper No. U.0 S. 202.

7. The Chief of the. Imperial General Staff considers that the armoured car or tank, being the latest powerful weapon of war, occupies the same position as the field gun has for the last fifty years, and he is of opinion that it would be dangerously increasing internal risks, particularly in India, if such weapons were handled by personnel who might use them against us He therefore considers that the policy should be adopted of allowing such weapons to be handled only by British personnel so long as we have the power to enforce such a course of action. He cannot agree with the analogy of the supply of aircraft.The Chief of the Naval Staff agrees with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and holds that if it is necessary to maintain a white garrison in a country for purposes of defence and to control or contain native forces of questionable reliability, it is a mistake to make these, native forces more powerful than is essential, as to do so would entail either a weakening of control or an increase of the white garrison. If powerful weapons are necessary, they should be in the hands of, or controlled by, white personnel. With Trans-Jordania surrounded by Arab States, it is important to uphold this principle in that country.8. On the other hand, as pointed out by the Chief of the Air Staff, we have already approved of the supply of aircraft to potential enemies, such as Ibn Saud. We have agreed to teach Egyptians, Indians, and Iraqis to fly, and we have raised no opposition to the formation of an armoured car and motor machine-gun unit manned by Iraqis. To refuse to allow natives in Trans-Jordan, in units officered by British personnel, to man armoured fighting vehicles, is perhaps hardly consistent with this policy. It must also be borne in mind that the potential enemies of Trans-Jordan, for example, include Ibn Saud, who has armoured cars and can obtain tanks, and that similar weapons must be provided to deal with them. On the other hand, the local defence forces have to be paid for by the local taxpayer, and sometimes the Imperial Exchequer, who would object to the large increase of expenditure necessary if the most up-to-date weapons for local defence can only be obtained on condition that they are manned by white personnel.9. The Chief of the Air Staff further submits that a policy of refusing modern weapons to native units in territories under our control cannot in any case be adhered to for long, and, at any rate in so far as the territories for the defence of which the Air Ministry is responsible are concerned, he considers no undue risk would be run by allowing such weapons to be handled by local native personnel.10. On the other hand, we cannot overlook the reaction which the adoption of such a policy in these particular countries must exercise on the Indian Army and on the Forces of the Native States in India, by creating a demand for similar equip-ment. which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to refuse. The same argument applies in a lesser degree to the African Colonies.11. It is clear that both financial and political considerations are closely bound up with this question, and that the decision depends, in the main, on whether the increased risk to internal security in India and Africa, which must inevitably result from placing armoured fighting vehicles in the hands of native personnel elsewhere, is one which can be accepted.This, we submit, is a matter which the Committee of Imperial Defence, with its wider scope, is more qualified than ourselves to decide.(Signed) H.

Enclosure.[C.I.D. Paper No. 9H4-B. (Also O.D.G. 576-M.)]TRANS-JORDAN FRONTIER FORCE.Proposals for Mechanization of Native Units.Memorandum by the Oversea Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.1. THE Colonial Office have referred to the Oversea Defence Committee the question of the mechanization of part of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force, which has recently been the subject of correspondence with the Air Ministry.2. The Trans-Jordan Frontier Force is locally recruited. A certain number of officers and non-commissioned officers are drawn from the native population, but the Officer Commanding, 16 other officers, and 15 non-commissioned officers are British. The force is at present divided into 3 Cavalry Companies and 1 Camel Company, and the proposal now under consideration is to replace the Camel Company by a mechanized company of infantry, and to provide the 3 Cavalry Companies with second-line transport composed of motor lorries.3. Colonel Shute, the Officer Commanding the Trans-Jordan Frontier For.ce, who had consulted the Air Ministry, and with the latter&apos;s representative had visited the Experimental Establishment of the Royal Tank Corps at Aldershot, recom-mended that Carden-Loyd armoured vehicles should be used in mechanizing the Camel Company.4. His views on the suitability of this vehicle for use in the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force were as follows : &quot;Whilst at Aldershot, and after discussion of the right solution of the problem of desert operations in Trans-Jordan with the officers of the Royal Tank Corps, my attention was drawn to the possibilities of using the light two-man tank (Carden-Loyd) in broken country unsuitable for wheeled transport.This is a fully &apos; tracked &apos; vehicle, weighing 27 cwt., armoured and carrying one driver and one machine gunner, with petrol capacity for 100 miles. It moves easily over all kinds of terrain at a speed of 20/30 miles per hour. The mechanism is simple and it can be transported in a Medium six-Wheeler Crossley, in addition to the proposed crew of nine men, with reserves of petrol, water, ammunition and rations.  It can be on- or off-loaded in three minutes.In considering the problem of desert operations of the type which occur in Trans-Jordan, I have often stated that the solution, if it were possible, is to transport mounted men to the scene of operations in some form of M.T. Bedouins know the capabilities of wheeled mechanical transport, and will always, when raiding, choose a locality for their camp within easy reach of[20130] b 2
country unsuitable for cars and make for such country when pursued. With a ;:&apos; mixed force of R.A.F. Armoured Cars and mechanized infantry in such circum-c stances, it is necessary to send the armoured cars round to block the exits from the bad country whilst the infantry on foot try to push the raiders into the open country. Infantry, under such circumstances, are at a disadvantage in that the raiders are mounted on camels and can move faster. With Carden-Loyd tanks the problem is much simplified, as they can move much faster than camels, and are, moreover, armoured and carry machine guns.A further aspect of the case is that a convoy of unarmoured troop-carriers is very vulnerable whilst on the move in rough country which restricts movement of wheeled vehicles to a single track. With Carden-Loyds it would, be possible to use them as advance and flank guards in such circumstances.&quot;5. While expressing general agreement with Colonel Shute&apos;s proposals, the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan suggested that the number of Carden-Loyds ordered should be limited to 2 until their usefulness had been proved.6. The Air Ministry, in commenting on the proposed mechanization, raised no objection to Carden-Loyds being sent to Trans-Jordan for purposes of trial, but made it clear that their concurrence in this proposal in no way committed them to agreeing to the equipment of the force with tanks at a later date. They also gave their opinion that it was not at present advisable for these vehicles to be manned by native personnel.7. In view of the fact that white personnel would not be available for manning all vehicles when the company is finally mechanized, and the War Office having intimated that it was contrary to their policy to allow tanks or similar vehicles to be manned by native troops, the Colonial Office asked that the matter might be discussed by the Oversea Defence Committee.8. At the 298th Meeting of the Committee on the 14th October, 1929, the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, War Office, pointed out that it had hitherto been the considered policy of the War Office to keep armoured fighting vehicles or machine-gun carriers solely in the hands of white troops, and that the proposals made with regard to the mechanization of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force contravened this principle.He informed the Committee that the late Commander-in-Chief in India had expressed an emphatic opinion against allowing native troops to man armoured cars, and drew attention to the fact that in India field guns have always been kept in the hands of Artillery units from Great Britain.9. On the other hand, the Committee are informed that the Air Ministry have raised no objections to native rulers not under British control, such as Ibn Saud, being supplied with modern aircraft, and it is known that up-to-date armoured cars have also been supplied privately to such individuals.10. After a brief discussion, the Oversea Defence Committee reached the conclusion that, as a question of policy is involved, they could proceed no further in the matter without guidance from higher authority. They submit that the formulation of a definite policy with regard to the mechanization of native troops in the Colonies, &amp;c, especially in those territories depending for security on aircraft supplemented by local forces, is becoming urgently necessary, and they suggest that this is a matter which the Committee of Imperial Defence may wish to refer to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.11. The necessity for an agreed policy regarding the mechanization of native units in countries where no British military units are normally available is emphasised by the fact that, in addition to the proposals for Trans-Jordan, referred to above, semi-official suggestions have recently been made regarding the supply of 2 Carden-Loyds to the King&apos;s African Rifles as a first step towards the partial mechanization of that force.12. While the Committee are of opinion that there can be no particular objection on grounds of policy to the issue of 2 Carden-Loyds either to East Africa or Trans-Jordan for experimental purposes under the supervision of British
personnel, they feel that it would be unfair to the Local Governments concerned to sanction such experiments at the latter&apos;s expense if equipment of the Local Forces with these vehicles at a later date is likely to be banned. In this connection the Committee would observe that some doubt has been expressed as to whether the particular vehicle in question the Carden-Loyd has yet reached the stage for trials in a country like Trans-Jordan. This does not, however, affect the general question of policy on which a decision is requested.(Signed) G. N.

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.35Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 24:5th Meeting, held on November 14, 1929.(3.)-MECHANIZATION OF NATIVE UNITS. (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 964-B* and 965-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 965-B) and a Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 964-B).THE PRIME MINISTER said that the gist of the question before the Committee was that some difference of opinion had arisen between the Air Staff and the General Staff regarding the mechanization of native units and levies. The general policy of the War Office had for years been to avoid equipping native troops with the latest weapons for fear that the latter might be used against us. The Air Ministry, on the other hand, found it difficult to agree in view of the particular circumstances of their responsibilities in such places as Iraq and Trans-Jordan, the main grounds for their objections being financial, He was inclined to think that this was perhaps more a question for consideration by the Cabinet.LORD THOMSON agreed, and emphasised that an old and very important principle was at stake, namely, whether we should allow the most formidable modern weapons of war to get into the hands of natives who might use them against us.Mr. SHAW said he thought this was a question worthy of the gravest consideration. The War Office were firmly convinced that the present policy of not allowing the most modern weapons to be handled by natives for fear of their being-used against us should be adhered to.SIR CLAUD JACOB remarked that similar arguments applied, in an even greater degree, to India.The PRIME MINISTER observed that in his own mind he felt definitely of opinion that the old principle should be reaffirmed, even if it was found necessary to depart from the principle in special cases.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that not only finance was involved. In countries like Trans-Jordan we were responsible for the security of tribes under our control. At the same time, we were selling armoured cars and aeroplanes to neighbouring tribes over which we had no control, with the result that our own tribes, in the event of trouble with their neighbours, had to rely on camels and horses in warfare with the most modern weapons of war. He suggested that, in effect, if trouble took place, we were simply asking for defeat. If the War Office principle was adhered to, the only way in which modern weapons could be provided for the defence of the territories under consideration was to increase the white personnel. He fully sympathised with the War Office and did not wish to oppose their arguments too warmly, as he realised the possible reactions in India. On the other hand, he was responsible for making arrangements to protect Trans-Jordan against inroads, and at present only a useless Camel Company was available instead of armoured fighting vehicles.* This Paper is printed as Enclosure to No. 965-B.[20160-3]
.- LORD LASS FIELD observed that in Palestine and Trans-J ordan we were theoretically exposed to attacks from several directions, and it appeared a little hard to lay clown that these territories must not have the most efficient and modern weapons for self-defence.. SIR HUGH TRENCHARD mentioned that to-morrow four British subjects were sailing for.Iraq to take aeroplanes to Ibn Saud. The reasons for our having agreed to this procedure were fully known to the Foreign Office and Colonial Office.. &apos;,. Mr. SHAW suggested that enough had been said to demonstrate to the Committee that very grave issues were involved. He submitted that the Air and General Staffs should again get together to see whether they could not recommend an agreed solution.SIR GEORGE MILNE said that this proposal could hardly lead to success m view of his own very strong views, which were stated in the Report. He was firmly convinced that if we allowed fighting armoured vehicles to be handled by native troops and levies we would be building up very grave danger for ourselves in various parts of the world, especially if existing garrisons were reduced. He mentioned that on several occasions Indian Princes visiting England, who had seen tanks and other up-to-date weapons, had asked to be supplied with such weapons. So long as we had a rigid principle requests of this kind could be refused, but if we allowed Trans-Jordan, for example, to have armoured fighting vehicles, it would be impossible to refuse their supply to the Indian Princes.SIR CLAUD JACOB said that immediately after the war, when he was Chief of the General Staff in India, the same problem had had to be faced. Many reductions of troops had been made, especially in Cavalry, and the reduction of the latter had only been agreed to by the Commander-in-Chief on condition that new powerful white units were raised. As a result of this c ondition, eight white armoured-car companies had been formed.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD, in reply to the Prime Minister, said he could not see how the War Office and Air Ministry, with their widely differing responsibilities in regard to defence, could agree in the matter. The Air Ministry had to arrange for the defence of mandated territories as cheaply and efficiently as possible.   ToEut the Trans-Jordan Camel Company up against tribes with armoured cars was, e suggested, ridiculous.  The only way open appeared to be to provide more British personnel, but then they were up against the Treasury.THE PRIME&quot; MINISTER, asked what had actually given rise to the present controversy.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD explained that the Air Ministry had lately been sending unarmoured mechanical vehicles to mandated territories, and recently Nejd had notified that they were going to purchase armoured cars, which, of course, they were quite free to do. In Trans-Jordan, which was under our control, it had been found that the numerous raids could not be satisfactorily dealt with by levies mounted on camels and horses, whereas in Iraq raids had been stopped to a very-great extent by means of our own armoured car units. It was felt that if the trans-Jordan Camel Company could be replaced by armoured vehicles, and this could be done at very little extra expense, the local levies would be able to carry out their defence duties far more efficiently than at present.LORD THOMSON suggested that it should be possible to keep the main principle intact, whilst making special exceptions in the case of mandated territories, whose situation was, he suggested, very different to that of India.LORD PASSFIELD added that if we had to go before the Permanent Mandare Commission of the League of Nations and admit that twenty raids into Trans-Jordan had taken place within the last few weeks, and that with our present means of defence we had been quite unable to prevent them, we should expose ourselves to the charge of not carrying out our responsibilities properly.Mr. SHAW suggested that making exceptions to the principle in such circum-stances to save very small sums of money might well result in enormous increases of expenditure elsewhere.
7G******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 14, 1929.&apos; LORD PASSFIELD said he had no-objection to the principle advanced by the War Office being adhered to so long as the necessary weapons for defence could be obtained otherwise.  It appeared to be mainly a matter for the Treasury.THE PRIME MINISTER said it seemed evident that the Committee generally were against any change in the general principle. On the other hand, he felt that further steps should be taken to see whether agreement could not be reached as regards departing from the principle in special cases. He suggested that the papers under discussion should be circulated to the Cabinet, and that if necessary the latter should refer the question to a small Cabinet Sub-Committee. He hoped that this procedure would, however, involve no undue delay.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD, in reply to the Prime Minister, said there was no great urgency in the matter.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed That  the  question  should  be  referred  to  the   Cabinet   for  further consideration.
