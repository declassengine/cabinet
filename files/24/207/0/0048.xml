In accordance with the Cabinet decision of December3rd, 1929,   (Cabinet 51 (29) Con020) a Meeting of the Hours of Employment Bill Committee was called to consider what reply the Government should make to the International labour Office Questionnaire on the subject of Hours of Work of &quot;Salaried Employees.&quot;   The Home Secretary and the Attorney-General attended the meeting but the Secretary cf State for the Dominions and the President of the Board of Trade were unable to be present.2. The Committee had before them the InternationalLabour Office Questionnaire and the observations of the Trade Union Congress General Council.    Both these docu-ments are annexed hereto.    It will be noted that the Trades Union Congress General Council are in favour of a single Convention covering every kind of Employee not included in the scope of the Washington Convention.    Later in the afternoon, accompanied by the Attorney-General, I met a deputation organised by the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations in regard to which I annex hereto a brief separate note.    My colleagues will note from the list of those present the importance of the interests represented.3. The Committee, on an examination of the Questionnaire,have come to the conclusions:-
(1) That the subject covering as it does a large range of miscellaneous occupations of very different kinds,  is not susceptible of being dealt with in a single instrument whether in the shape of a draft Convention or recommendation.(2) That as regards all the occupations in question, even that of Shop -assistants about whose con-&apos; dltions of work more is known than about those of the other classes, the information as to hours, overtime and other conditions of em-ployment which would be necessary for drawing up a workable Convention or recommendation is not in the possession of the Government Departments concerned.(3) That as regards most of the occupations, e.g. journalists, commerieal travellers,  outdoor and indoor amusement employees, officials of organisations etc. , the information would be practically impossible to get.4. The Committee accordingly recommend to the Cabinetthat the International Labour Office should be informed in reply to tho Questionnaire that the-   Government do not think it practicable at the present time to go further than a recommendation to the effect that the States Members should undertake an enquiry into the conditions of employment in the distributive trades. 5. Regarding the subject from the point of view ofthe special position of the United Kingdom, the Committee are strongly of opinion that the Government should not contemplate any further undertaking in regard to the regulation of hours of employment until the Hours Bill has been passed and some experience of its working^ and effects in industry has been obtained. 6. If my colleagues approve the Committee^  .recommendations, in which the Home Secretary concurs, it will be necessary to arrange an interview with representatives of the Trades Union Congress General&apos; Council and inform them of our decision with the reasons for it.(Intld. ) r.:.G.B.is try of Labour, December 7tbr 1929.

APPENDIX    IIIDEPUTATION PROM TEE NATIONAL    CONFEDERATION :r    OF EMPLOYERS1  ORGANISATIONS.The Deputation, consisting of those in the attached listbegan by reminding me that when this subject was placed onthe Conference agenda by the Governing Body as the resultof a certain amount of manoeuvring, the representativesnot only of the British Government and Employers but also of the British workers protested that owing to the way inwhich the voting had been conducted the result was not a true inflection of the opinion of the majority and must lackmoral weight when presented to the other States Members.After emphasising the vagueness ox the subject and the impossibility of any effective international arrange-ment they urged the Government to take every step to prevent an impracticable subject from drifting on into an unworkableConvention.   With this object they definitely asked thatthe International Labour Office should be informed inreply to the Questionnaire that in the opinion of theGovernment the time is not yet ripe for making this matter the subject of a Questionnaire.
