Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. copy No    77A.L. (29) 4.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES.Report of Sub-Committee.AT the first meeting of the Committee the Lord President of the Council appointed a Sub-Committee composed of the four Departmental Representatives (Mr. G. B. Canny, C.B. (Treasury), Mr. I. G. Gibbon, C.B.E. (Ministry of Health), Mr. E. L. Mitchell, O.B.E. (Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries), and Mr. H. H. Piggott, C.B., C.B.E. (Ministry of Transport), and invited the Sub-Committee to report on &quot;the question of the acquisition of land for public purposes, whether by Government Departments or by Local Authorities, including the question of giving power to Local Authorities to acquire land for prospective development.&quot;The subject is dealt with under two heads, Government Departments and Local Authorities. The parts of the reports containing recommendations are indicated by a marginal line.I. Government Departments.The Sub-Committee have conferred with representatives of the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Office of Works, Post Office and Forestry Commission. In each case they were informed that work was not being held up because of lack of means of expeditiously acquiring land. The Departments did not ask for any special powers, but considered that, if obtained, they might be of service in future cases.The statement annexed (appendix A) contains a summary of the powers of these Departments for the acquisition of land.As regards the Ministry of Transport, the Minister, should he himself desire to construct a new road, can apply to the Development Commissioners for an Order empowering him compulsorily to acquire the necessary land where he is unable to acquire it by agreement on reasonable terms. The Ministry of Transport do not regard this procedure as altogether satisfactory, because difficulties have arisen with regard to the interpretation of the condition that there has been failure to acquire land by agreement on reasonable terms. The Minister also has power (under section 2 of the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920), after giving 7 days&apos; notice, to enter upon any undeveloped land required for a new arterial road which he is himself constructing, provided that a certificate is obtained from the Minister of Labour as required by the section. The Ministry of Transport are not themselves at the present time undertaking direct works, and accordingly no work is being held up owing to lack of powers in the matter of the acquisition of land.Instances may, of course, occur in the future where a Government Department may be held up by the absence of expeditious means of acquiring land. The only way of ensuring expedition is to give the appropriate Minister power compulsorily to acquire land on his own Order. Objection would almost certainly be raised in some quarters to such a procedure and a demand made for some appellate body. It seems, however, extremely doubtful whether any appellate body other than Parliament itself would be proper in a case where a question of policy might arise.On the whole, the Sub-Committee submit that to include in a Bill any provision j for more speedy machinery for the acquisition of land by Government Departments I would be to burden it with profitless controversy. J[20190] b
II. Local Authorities.It is not possible to ascertain without special enquiry to what extent any present schemes of Local Authorities are being held up owing to lack of expeditious procedure in acquiring land. Only three applications for Provisional Orders for compulsory acquisition have been received this year by the Ministry of Health up to the present, but some others are known to be in course of preparation and the time is yet early for applications. It may be mentioned that, during the last three years, 47 Provisional Orders were confirmed for the compulsory acquisition of land&apos;. During the same period, 100 Ministerial Orders were issued for the compulsory acquisition of land for housing under the more expeditious procedure applicable for that purpose; and 52 Orders and approvals have been issued by the Ministry of Transport under the procedure of the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920, in respect of road works. This total is not large in proportion to the number of cases where land is acquired by agreement.Where a Provisional Order has to be obtained, it may be assumed that the Local Authority will not be able to obtain compulsory possession within less than twelve months, and the time is often much longer.Available evidence goes to show that in many cases a good deal of time is spent in bargaining about price, and that Local Authorities could obtain more expeditious possession of land if a more simple method were provided for acquiring land compulsorily, and if Local Authorities used the powers; further, that at times Local Authorities pay too high a price for land which they have to obtain quickly in cases where there is no speedy method of obtaining possession except by agreement. It will be appreciated that special local inquiry would be necessary to ascertain the precise number of cases in which delay has taken place for these reasons.The above remarks do not apply with the same force to the acquisition of land for road works carried out to relieve unemployment, because, under section 1 of the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920, there is provided a simple method of compulsory acquisition (the procedure of the Housing Acts), when the necessary certificate with regard to unemployment has been given by the Minister of Labour. Under section 2 of the Act, the Local Authority can enter on seven days&apos; notice (without any Order for compulsory acquisition), when the certificate of the Minister of Labour required by the section has been given, but this special procedure can be applied only in regard to land which is not built upon.It should be added that the practical effect of section 1 of the Act is that, so far as Local Authorities are concerned, the speedy machinery provided can be applied only where Local Authorities are carrying out road works, because we are advised that the section is applicable only in cases where a power of compulsory acquisition, without Parliamentary confirmation, is already available apart from the Act.The absence of a speedy method of compulsory acquisition undoubtedly leads to delay in many instances, and it is highly desirable to deal with the matter. But on the information which the Sub-Committee have been able to gather within the time at their disposal, they cannot say that the removal of the difficulty is of such crucial importance for quickly increasing the volume of employment as to provide an over-whelming case for pushing through the necessary measure if it is likely to meet with strenuous opposition.If it is decided to introduce legislation to facilitate the compulsory acquisition of land, the recommendations of the Sub-Committee are as follows : 1. That Local Authorities, including Joint Boards, be empowered to acquire land compulsorily by Order, if the Order is confirmed by the appropriate Minister, without any necessity for further confirmation by Parliament. This is the procedure now for compulsory acquisition of land for housing and a number of other purposes;2. That the Local Authority should be enabled thus to acquire land only in those Cases where they can now acquire land, either by agreement or compulsion, for works or any other specific purpose. The Committee think that the powers should be extended to include, in connection with the construction of roads, easements over or under railways or canals;3. That the new powers should be of general application; but, if thought expedient, their operation might be limited to a period of three years (subject to renewal);
If the Government desire to give&quot; Local Authorities power for the acquisition of additional land for recoupment and for control of development, the recom-mendations of the Sub-Committee are 4. That the Local Authority should be enabled, with the express consent of the appropriate Government Department, also to acquire additional land, whether by agreement or compulsion, for these purposes ;* and5. That the Local Authority should have power to dispose of the additional land so acquired, either by sale or lease; but any such lands retained by the Local Authority should be used only for purposes for which the Local Authority are empowered to use land.These recommendations are dealt with in the following sections (pages 3 to 7).The recommendations of the Sub-Committee for expediting procedure necessarily involve enlarging the powers of Ministers; and it will be appreciated that they are open to the epithets now being so freely hurled at the &quot; New Despotism.&quot;If it should be desired in the circumstances of the time to introduce more definite Parliamentary check than the general responsibility of Ministers to Parliament, the Sub- Committee suggest one of the following alternatives : -1. The Draft Order to be submitted to the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords and the Chairman of Ways and Means in the House of Commons. If they think, on the ground of the character or magnitude of the scheme, that the Order should be submitted to Parliament, the Order not to become effective unless and until it has been approved by resolution passed by both Houses. There is a precedent in the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, sec. 29 (3), which relates to railway Orders.2. If, after the Order of the Minister has been issued, objection to the Order is made and maintained by an interested person, the Order to become a Provisional Order and to pass through the usual stages. There is a precedent for this in the Water Undertakings (Modification of Charges). Act, 1921.  That experiment has been highly successful.It should be pointed out, however, that the number of persons affected by an Order for the compulsory acquisition of land may be. large. But there is good reason to think that there would not be many cases in which opposition to an Order would be effectively maintained, especially if, as is desirable, the objection had to be on merits only, not merely on price (a question properly determinable under the Acquisition of Land (Assess-ment of Compensation) Act, 1919), and if it were provided that as a guarantee that the objector genuinely intended to prosecute his objection, and was not merely playing for time, he had to deposit a reasonable sum.Of the two alternatives, the former appears to the Sub-Committee to be preferable, if it is likely to be acceptable to Parliament.A simple way of improving the present position would be to amend the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920, by making the special provisions of section 1 apply not only to cases where Local Authorities can now obtain compulsory powers without the confirmation of Parliament (as is held to be the interpretation of the section), but to any case where a Local Authority can now apply for compulsory powers even by Provisional Order; but the Sub-Committee do not recommend this because (a) it seems undesirable that a simplified procedure should be restricted to works carried out expressly to relieve unemployment, (&amp;) powers of compulsory acquisition are desirable in some cases (as will be indicated later) where Local Authorities cannot now apply for such powers, and (c) in any event, if it is decided to deal with the acquisition of land for recoupment and control of development, legislation will be necessary apart altogether from the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920.Procedure by Provisional Order (section 176 of the Public Health Act, 1875) is cumbrous and slow.  Thus 1. Proposals must be advertised and notices served on parties affected in two successive months towards the end of the year.* One of our members, Mr. Canny, suggests that it is a matter for consideration whether this power should be restricted to the larger Local Authorities.(1.) Compulsory Acqiiisition by Ministerial Order.[20190]B 2
2. Local Inquiry must be held, after some lapse of time. 3. The Order is Provisional.4. It is embodied in a Bill which must pass through all the Parliamentary stages.5. Even after the Order has been confirmed, there may be delay in entering upon possession of the land (see appendix B).The Sub-Committee consider that procedure by Ministerial Order, should it be adopted, could be justified on the following grounds : 1. It would enable land to be acquired more expeditiously.2. There are numerous instances where procedure even now is by Ministerial Order (appendix C).3. There are adequate safeguards Minister must hold Inquiry if there are objections by persons interested in the land; after the Order is confirmed, the Local Authority have to pay a fair price for the land, which, in case of dispute, is determined under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.4. Cases where a Provisional Order (which has already received Ministerial confirmation) is opposed in Parliament are rare.If the proposals of the Sub-Committee are adopted, the procedure might be on the lines of the Housing Act, 1925 (section 64, and 3rd Schedule). The Regulations made by the Minister under the Act (the requirements might well be embodied in any new Act) provide that-1. The compulsory Order has to be made by the Local Authority.2. The Order has to be advertised in two successive weeks, the first advertise-ment to be inserted within 7 days of the making of the Order. .i     3. Within the said 7 days, notice of the Order has to be served on owners, lesseesand occupiers.4. Objections from persons interested in the land must be received within 14 days of the first advertisement. (The limitation of the right of objection to those &quot;interested in the land&quot; might reasonably be extended, for neighbouring owners may have legitimate objections to the proposed use of the land for sewage disposal, for instance.)The Act provides that 5. If such objections are received and maintained, the Minister must direct apublic Local Inquiry (3rd Schedule). 6. The Order becomes operative when confirmed by the Minister (section 64). 7. When the Order has been confirmed, there is a right of entry after not lessthan 14 days&apos; notice (section 106).As regards 5 above, the Sub-Committee suggest as an improvement the provision in section 17 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1926, under which an Inquiry need not be held if the objection relates only to the question of compensation, which can be settled under the Acquisition of Land, &amp;c, Act, 1919.It is not suggested that the Housing Act procedure should be adopted where the existing procedure operates satisfactorily.A further minor improvement is suggested. Under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, the Local Authority, if they require to take part of a piece of land, can be compelled in certain circumstances by the owner to take the whole property (sections 92 and 93). There is a provision common in Local Acts under which a Local Authority may take part only of a property if the arbitrator under the Act of 1919 is satisfied that the part can be severed from the remainder without material detriment thereto (e.g., section 23 of Middlesex and Surrey (Thames Bridges, &amp;c.) Act, 1928). Such a provision is also contained in some public enactments (Development and Road Improvement Bunds Act, 1909, paragraph 4 of Schedule, and Section 4 of Light Railways Act, 1912). It should be made of general application.Cases may occur in which the acquisition of part only of a property may involve the Local Authority in payment of disproportionate compensation in respect of the damage caused to the owner by severance or injurious affection. In such cases the Sub-Committee consider that it should be competent for the Local Authority
to acquire by agreement or compulsion the whole of the property if that course is considered by the appropriate Minister desirable in the interests of economy.The Sub-Committee also suggest a provision that the arbitrator, in determining the amount of any disputed compensation, should fairly estimate&apos; and set off the enhancement in value of the adjoining lands of the same owner. This is now a common provision in Local Acts (e.g., section 22 of Hastings Corporation Act, 1928). It also occurs, with variations of wording, in section 13 (1) of the Light Railways Act, 1896, the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909 (schedule (2), (C)), the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920 (section 1, proviso (c)), and the Public Health Act, 1925 (section 33 (10))*.(2.) Purposes.The Sub-Committee recommend that the new procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land should be applied only in cases where a Local Authority can now acquire land for works or any other specific purpose. The Sub-Committee do not suggest that the powers of compulsory acquisition should apply wherever a Local Authority now has power to acquire land by agreement. For instance, a large number of Authorities can by agreement acquire land for the benefit, improvement, or development of their district. A great deal of opposition would probably be aroused if Local Authorities were enabled to acquire land compulsorily for these general purposes, nor is any such extension of powers necessary in order to facilitate the carrying out of works.There are, however, some cases to which the Sub-Committee consider that the power to acquire land compulsorily should be extended, even though the Local Authority can now acquire land only by agreement. For instance, Local Authorities can acquire by agreement, but cannot be empowered to acquire by compulsion, land for aerodromes under the Air Navigation Act, 1920. We are informed that a number of Authorities have schemes in hand for the provision of aerodromes, and that in one instance, Portsmouth, the Council are promoting a Bill for the compulsory acquisition of land. (The preparation of the land and the works for an aerodrome gives, of course, some employment.) In London neither the London County Council nor the Borough Councils have, for instance, any power, except by Bill, to acquire compulsorily land for open spaces and public recreation grounds, although provincial Authorities can obtain compulsory powers for these purposes by Provisional Order. These defects would be met by the Sub-Committee&apos;s proposal that the compulsory powers should cover land required for works or for a specific purpose.Easements over or under Railways or Canals.Difficulties frequently arise in the acquisition of highway easements over or under railways or canals. Speaking generally,.such an easement can be acquired only by agreement, and the absence of compulsory powers has led to serious delay.It is suggested that on the application of a Highway Authority, the Minister of Transport^should be empowered to make an Order providing for a compulsory easement to carry a highway over or under a railway or canal, and that any dispute between the Highway Authority and the Railway Company as to the manner in which effect should be given to the easement should be settled by the Minister. Special provision would have to be made as to the terms of compensation, but the machinery of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, should be applied.Veto of Statutory Undertakers.There is a further matter with which it would be well to deal. Under the Public Health Act, 1875 (s. 327), Local Authorities cannot do anything which will interfere with any works or property vested in or affecting Land Drainage Commissioners, the Lord High Admiral, the War Office, Port and Harbour Authorities, and some other bodies acting under statutory powers, unless the consent of the bodies or persons be obtained.   For example, if a Local Authority proposes to* There is no provision as to betterment in the Acquisition of Lands (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919. In the course of the debate in the Commons on the Second Reading of the Bill the Attorney-General (Sir Gordon Hewart, now Lord Hewart), replying to representations by the Opposition, said that the Government regarded the question of betterment as too large and difficult to be dealt with in a measure directed solely to the improvement of the machinery for assessing compensation.
carry a sewer across ditches or streams which are vested in a land drainage authority, the latter are in a position to hold up the whole scheme of sewerage. The&apos; Sub-Committee suggest a provision by which any such veto can be removed by the appropriate Minister, or by agreement of the appropriate Ministers where two or more are concerned. (In the instance mentioned, for example, the Minister of Health is concerned with sewerage and the Minister of Agriculture is concerned with drainage and would be protector of drainage interests.)Water Rights.It was at one time considered that, in view of the definition of &quot; lands &quot; in the Public Health Act, 1875, the Central Department had power to make a Provisional Order under Section 176, enabling a Local Authority compulsorily to acquire water rights (such as the taking of whole or part of the water in a river, stream or lake). In 1878 the Law Officers advised the Parliamentary Committee that a Provisional Order for compulsory purchase of water rights was xdtra vires. Any Local Authority, therefore, desiring to acquire water rights compulsorily must proceed by Private Bill. While it would be of advantage that the proposed simplified procedure for compulsory acquisition should apply to water rights, the matter is by no means free from complications. A number of persons and Authorities may, for instance, be interested in any proposal to abstract water from a river; and in many cases provision may have to be made for compensation water, a matter of much controversy; and, therefore, if it is contemplated that legislation should be kept within narrow limits, the Sub-Committee feel that they cannot well recommend that this subject should be included, although it is desirable that it should be dealt with at the earliest favourable opportunity.(3.) New Procedure to be of General Application.It has long been felt desirable to simplify the procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land. If the present proposals are confined to unemployment schemes, general reform may be delayed. Further, for the provision of work it is necessary to expedite the acquisition of land not only where the work is carried out expressly as an unemployment scheme, but also where it is being done in the ordinary course of business. The present procedure is antiquated, and large inroads have already been made in it for particular purposes (see appendix C). If, however, it is felt to be expedient not to apply the new procedure without limit, it would be better to restrict its operation to a period of, say, three years, than to tie it up with unemployment schemes.(4.) Land for Recoupment and Control of Development.Apart from powers in private Acts for specific schemes, the only powers at present possessed by Local Authorities are the following :  (1.) The Middlesex County Council, with the consent of the Minister of Trans-port, may acquire by agreement, or failing agreement, can be enabled by Order of the Development Commissioners to acquire compulsorily, any land within 220 yards from the middle of any new arterial road which they propose to construct, or on either side of any road which they propose to widen and improve (s. 44 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1925, as amended by s. 76 of the Middlesex and Surrey (Thames Bridges, &amp;c.) Act, 1928).(2.) Town Councils and Urban District Councils have power to acquire land for the improvement and development of frontages or of the lands abutting on or adjacent to any street (s. 154 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and s. 83 of the Public Health Act, 1925). Failing agreement, compulsory powers can be given by Provisional Order. County Councils will have the same power from the 1st April next (Local Government Act, 1929, Part III and First Schedule).The Minister of Transport, when he constructs a road, can acquire land by agreement or, failing agreement, by Order of the Development Commissioners, within 220 yards on each side from the middle of the road (s. 11 of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909, as amended).
If the Government desire that Local Authorities should have additional powers, the Sub-Committee suggest that this should be done by giving a general power to acquire additional land (at the time of acquisition of the substantive land) by agree-ment or compulsorily, for recoupment or for control of development.It is recommended, however, that the purchase of the excess land should be subject to the express consent of the appropriate Minister. Opposition might thus be mollified; moreover, experience does not show many instances where acquisition of excess land for recoupment is likely to be financially profitable, and there is much to be said for some definite check on Local Authorities who may be inclined to be a little reckless. The Local Authority could not, of course, acquire land compulsorily without an Order confirmed by the Minister (under the proposed simplified procedure), but we think it well that the responsibility of the Government Depart-ment should be emphasised by requiring an express consent to the acquisition of excess land. The Government Department would have the advantage of the advice of the Valuation Department, which has been found to be of the greatest service.The Sub-Committee considered whether some such limit as the 220 yards mentioned above should be imposed, but any limit would be arbitrary, even in the case of roads, and still more so where land has been acquired, for instance, for a public park. The sensible course would be to deal with each case on its merits, and to allow the acquisition of the excess land where it seems reasonable either for recoupment or for control of development.The Sub-Committee do not suggest that the powers of Local Authorities to acquire land for the improvement and development of frontages (s. 154 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and s. 83 of the Public Health Act, 1925) should be curtailed.(5.) Disposal of Excess Lands.Local Authorities should have a free hand to sell or to lease the excess lands acquired under 4; but they should not sell or lease below current market value without the consent of the appropriate Government Departmnt. (This is a common provision in Local Acts; see, eg., Chester Corporation Act, 1929, s. 23.)It is suggested, however, that they should not be authorised themselves to use the lands for purposes other than those for which they can now use lands under the general law. It seems desirable to avoid the controversial issues which would be raised by seeking to give to Local Authorities a general power to develop the lands. It may be mentioned, however, that some Local Authorities have obtained by local Act wider powers of development. Thus, the Croydon Corporation Act, 1927, s. 67, enables the Corporation to lay out and develop certain lands which they had been empowered by the Act to acquire, by the erection of shops, offices, warehouses and other buildings, as well as by the making of roads.Among the reasons which have been urged by Local Authorities in particular cases for these powers is that they are hampered by their absence from obtaining the best return from the land, and even from selling the land for the best price. If it should be deemed expedient to endow Local Authorities with these wider powers, the Minister of Health might be enabled by Order to bestow them on a Local Authority in any particular case, the Order to be provisional if objection to it is made and maintained.Under s. 175 of the Public Health Act, 1875, the Local Authority are under an obligation to sell at the best price that can be obtained any surplus lands acquired in pursuance of powers in the Public Health Acts.   It would be well to repeal this [ provision.   There are numerous Local Act provisions enabling a Local Authority to I retain lands vested in them.The terms of reference relate only to Government Departments and Local Authorities. The Sub-Committee may state, however, that they have given some consideration to the position of other Statutory Bodies, chiefly Companies, in the matter of compulsory acquisition of land. The present position of Statutory Companies is briefly indicated in appendix D.The Sub-Committee have not been able to learn of any cases of Statutory Companies not proceeding with works solely on account of lack of powers for the acquisition of land. Statutory Companies generally obtain powers to carry out works directly from Parliament, and they usually obtain powers at the same time to
acquire the necessary land. In the circumstances, it appears that the mere giving-of more speedy means of acquiring land would not be of much effect in expeditino-works.There are some specially constituted Statutory Bodies, not Local Authorities or Companies, such as Dock or Harbour or Drainage Authorities. These Bodies can generally obtain powers for the compulsory acquisition of land only by Bill; Land Drainage Authorities, however, can obtain such powers by Provisional Order made by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (s. 21, etc., of the Land Drainage Act, 1861). These Bodies do not trade for profit, and might be put in the same position as Local Authorities as regards the compulsory acquisition of land; but as the Sub-Committee have not been able to ascertain that any works proposed by such Bodies are being held up solely by lack of powers for the compulsory acquisition of land, they submit that in this case also it would be prudent to omit them from any legislation contemplated for the present emergency.In the case of works of magnitude, it is difficult to see how the necessary powers could be conferred on a statutory undertaking otherwise than by an Act of Parlia-ment. If it were desired to expedite the proceedings, this could be achieved only by an alteration of the present procedure for Private Bills.III.The following is a summary of the findings and recommendations of the Sub-Committee if the Government decide to introduce legislation : -(1.) There are not sufficient reasons of practical advantage for providing more speedy machinery for the acquisition of land by Government Depart-ments.(2.) There is a case for expediting the compulsory acquisition of land by Local Authorities.(3.) This should be done by enabling Local Authorities compulsorily to acquire land by Ministerial Order. If it is considered inexpedient to provide procedure by Ministerial Order without qualification, suggestions for a modified procedure are made on page 3.(4.) The procedure should be available for any land required by Local Authorities for works or for a specific purpose. A similar procedure should also be applied to obtaining highway easements over or under railways or canals.(5.) These new powers should be generally available, and not restricted to works which are undertaken expressly for the relief of unemployment.(6.) Local Authorities should be enabled by the same procedure to acquire additional land for recoupment or for control of development, but only with the express consent of the appropriate Minister.(7.) Local Authorities should be enabled to sell or to lease such additional land or to use it for any purpose for which they have power to use land owned by them, but not (unless they have special statutory powers in that behalf) for general development (such as building business premises).While there is undoubtedly a problem to be dealt with, the Sub-Committee suggest that the first question to be decided is whether it is expedient to introduce legislation of this kind at a time when there is so much criticism, informed or misinformed, of the alleged growing powers of Government Departments and when a Committee has just been appointed to consider this question:Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,(Signed) I.

APPENDIX A.Existing Powers of (a) Government Departments and (b) Forestry Commission,to Acquire Land.Office of Works.Acts as principal on behalf of all civil Departments except the Post Office and as agent for the Post Office. Properties are acquired by agreement and no serious difficulty has arisen from the absence of compulsory powers.Post Office.Powers are obtained at times (e.g., in 1928, but not in 1929), under a Post Office (Sites) Act to acquire particular properties, this course being adopted for the purpose both of facilitating determination of price and of enabling owners to give title.  Usually, however, acquisition is effected by agreement.The Post Office obtains facilities for the construction of telegraphic lines under the Telegraph Acts. Under those Acts it is necessary for the Postmaster-General to obtain consents which, if misused, may be made the subject of appeal to the Courts. The necessity of obtaining compulsory powers has not hitherto arisen.War Office.Lands are acquired under (a.) Defence Act, 1842.(6.) Military Lands Act, 1892.Under (a) a preliminary to the exercise of compulsory powers is a certificate by the Lord Lieutenant of the County in which the lands are situate or of two Deputy Lieutenants that it is necessary or expedient for the lands to be taken by the War Department. A warrant from the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury is also required. The procedure under this Act is out of date and occupies a period of at least five to six months. Possession of the land can be obtained after service of a Notice to Treat or after a formal offer has been made to the owner.Under (b) the procedure is by local inquiry. Provisional Order, and a confirming Act of Parliament. This procedure takes twelve to eighteen months or even longer if difficulties are experienced with the Confirming Act. The War Office do not proceed compulsorily under the Military Lands Act, 1892, unless they cannot use the Defence Act, 1842. Land acqured compulsorily under the Defence Act, 1842, cannot under Section 19 thereof be used for barrack accommodation, but this prohibition is repealed by Section 4 of the Defence Act, 1859, if the land to be cdmpulsorily acquired is within any fortress or garrison town or appurtenant to any fortification.Compensation under both (a) and (b) is settled by the Official Arbitrator under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.In general there is at the present time little difficulty in obtaining possession of land as and when it is required.Admiralty.The War Office procedure applies (Section 2 (1), Naval Works Act, 1895). The threat of compulsion suffices ordinarily to induce sale by agreement.Air Ministry.The War Office procedure applies.Forestry Commission.No difficulty is experienced in acquiring land by agreement on reasonable terms. The Forestry Act, 1919, provides powers of acquisition by compulsion, by Order of the Development Commissioners, but those powers have not hitherto been exercised. Delay arises mainly on questions of title.[201901c
APPENDIX B.Procedure for Entry on Land.Public Health Acts.Where a Provisional Order for compulsory purchase of land under the Public Health Acts has been made and confirmed, the provisions as to entry on lands are as follows : Under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, Section 85, the Local Authority cannot enter on the land, except with consent, until the compensation money has been determined and paid over or deposited in a Bank. The Local Authority may, however, enter at any time for the purpose of making surveys. They may also enter immediately, if they are willing to deposit as security with a Bank the compensation claimed by the vendor or awarded by a Surveyor appointed by two justices.Housing Act, 1925, and Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919.Under the Housing Act, 1925, section 106 (1), and the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919 (section 2) respectively, the Local Authority, after the Order is confirmed and notice to treat has been served, may enter on&apos; the land and take possession by giving notice of not less than 14 days.Unemployment [Relief Works) Act, 1920 [Section 2).Under the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920, section 2 (1), if the Minister of Labour certifies that immediate action is necessary for relieving unemployment, and that land cannot under the procedure set out in section 1 (the Housing Act procedure) be acquired with the expedition which the case requires, the Minister of Transport or, with his approval, any Local Authority is empowered to enter upon and take possession of any land required for the construction of any arterial road or for the improvement of any road, subject to the following conditions : (a) That the land is undeveloped, (b) that the land is such as the Local Authority might have been authorised to acquire compulsorily for the construction or improvement of a road apart from the special provisions in the 1920 Act, and (c) that seven days&apos; notice is given before entry.APPENDIX C.Purposes for which Land can be Compulsorily Acquired by Order.(1.)

Small Holdings and Allotments. An Order for compulsory acquisition becomes effective if confirmed by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.(5.) Education. An Order becomes effective if confirmed by the Board of Education, but in certain circumstances the Order, when confirmed, may have to be made provisional and be subject to confirmation by Parliament.
fj  j ci*APPENDIX D.Powers of Statutory Companies for the Compulsory Acquisition of Land.Water.- Compulsory powers can be obtained only by Bill. Gas. Compulsory powers can be obtained only by Bill.(The Board of Trade can give a Statutory Gas Company, by an Order confirmed by resolution of both Houses, power to carry out works, but can give powers to acquire land only by agreement. We are informed, however, by the Board of Trade that they do not know of a case in which this limitation has given rise to difficulties.)Railways. Powers can be obtained only by Bill, with this exception. Compulsory powers can be obtained by Order of the Ministry of Transport under section 17 of the Railway Act, 1921, for the acquisition of land and other easements and for the alteration, extension and improvement of existing works, up to a limit of  100,000 for land and works. The Draft Order has to be sent to the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords and the Chairman of Ways and Means in the House of Commons. If they object, on grounds of character or magnitude, to the making of the Order without the approval of Parliament, the Order must not be made until approved by a resolution passed by both Houses (sec. 29 (3) of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, as applied by sec. 17 of the Act of 1921.)Light Railways. Compulsory powers can be given by Order of the Minister of Transport under the Light Railways Acts. No reference is needed to Parliament unless the Minister considers the proposals ought to be submitted on account of their magnitude, or of their effect on any existing railway company, or for any other special reason (sec. 9 (3) of Light Railways Act, 1896, and sec. 68 (2), Railways Act, 1921.)Electricity. Compulsory powers to acquire land for a generating station may be given by Order of the Electricity Commissioners, confirmed by the Minister of Transport and approved by resolution in both Houses (sec. 1 of Electric Lighting-Act, 1909, and sec. 26 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919).o(6.) Libraries&apos;. If the Library Authority is the Local Education Authority for Higher Education, land can be acquired compulsorily as in the case of education and with the same procedure.(7.) Baths and Wash-houses. Under the last L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, Metropolitan Borough Councils are enabled to acquire land by order confirmed by the Minister of Health.(8.) Town Planning. A Town Planning Scheme may contain a provision enabling the Local Authority to acquire land for purposes specified in the scheme by Order if the 0*der is confirmed by the Minister of Health.(9.) Light Railways. Orders for compulsory acquisition of land are made by the Ministry of Transport.(10.) Parish Councils can be empowered by Order of the County Council to acquire land compulsorily for any purpose for which Parish Councils are authorised to acquire land. The order has to be confirmed by the Minister of Health, and con-firmation is automatic if no objection is made; if objection is made and maintained, the Minister must first direct a Local Inquiry.
0 A B I H 5 T .Committee on Acquisition of L-;nd for Public Purposes. Further Report of Sub-Committee supplementary to the Report dated 27th November. 1929.The Pub-Committee pointed out in their Report (page Z)  that a simple method of improving the present position in regard to the acquisition of land by Local Authorities would be to amend in certain respects the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1920.If the Government desire,  in connection with the present schemes for relieving unemployment, to pro-mote a measure amending the above Act, in a form likely to meet with the least opposition, the Sub-Co;.a-committee re-commend that -1.      The Expeditious procedure provided by Section I of that Act for the compulsory acquisition of land should be applied to all cases where Local Authori-ties can now acquire land for works or for any other specific purpose, including those cases in which Local Authorities are at present empowered to acquire lands only by agreement. The procedure in the Act for compulsory purchase can now be used for little more than road works towards which a grant is made by the Minister of Transport.2. At resent, the machinery provided by section 1 of the Act Or/n be used only &quot;when it is certified by the Minister of Labour that, having regard to the
amount of unemployment existing in any area, fit is desirable that the provisions of this section should be put into operation with a view to the speedy provision of employment for unemployed persons from that area&quot;.     It has been held (though the matter is not wholly free from doubt)  that a certificate within the meaning of the section can be given in respect of unemployment in one area when employment for men drawn from that area is provided by works in another area.      It is desirable that the speedy procedure for the acquisition of land should be available in every case where, having regard to existing unemployment in the country as a whole, it is expedient that works should be put-in hand without delay,      The procedure should be available whether the works are assisted by grant or not. The Sub-Committee consider that the Act should be amended in this sense. The Sub-Cqra.&apos;ittee explained on page 5 of their Report that difficulties frequently arise in acquiring highway easements over or under railways or canals.     In order to meet these difficulties it is suggested that the pro-visions of the Act should be made available for easements in general, and that the
appropriate Minister should be empowered t6 settle any dispute as to the manner in which or the con-ditions subject to which effect should be given to the easement. It is enacted by proviso (c) to section 1 of the Act that,  in determining the amount of disputed compensation, the arbitrator shall have regard to the extent to which adjoining lands of the same owner are benefited by the proposed works in cases where this course is directed by an enactment under which land for the works could have been acquired compulsorarily apart from the Aot of 19 20.     This provision, seemingly by inadvertence, was not included in section 2 of the Act (which provides machinery for obtaining immediate possession of land) ,The Sub-Coru-ittee consider that it should&apos; be pro-vided in all cases of acquisition of land under the Act that benefit to the same owner shall be set off against compensation, and that for this purpose it is desirable to follow the clearer terms of more recent Acts (for example, Public Health Act, 1925, section 33(10) - &quot;the benefits ... shall be fairly estimated and shall be set off against the compensations&quot;).In addition to the powers under section 1 of the Act, section 2 of the Act provides machinery for obtaining, on seven days1 notice, possession of undeveloped land (i.e. land on which there is no &quot;permanent building or structure&quot;) required for the construction or improvement of roads.      The
Sub-Committee suggest that this additional machinery should be made available, subject to the approval of the appropriate Minister, for any works where immediate possession of undeveloped land is desirable by reason of unemployment.It will be observed that the amendment of the Unemployment  (Relief Works) Act, 1920,  in the directions indicated above, would leave untouched the question of conferring on Local Authorities further powers for the acquisition of additional land for the purposes of recoupment cr for the control of development.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee.I.S.
