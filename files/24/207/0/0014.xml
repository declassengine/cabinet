Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    36CP. 324 (29).CABINET.SUPPLY OF CRUISERS TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.Notwithstanding previous decisions relating to export of arms and munitions of war to foreign Governments, and in vieAV of present state of unemployment, I feel bound to circulate to the Cabinet the attached memorandum which raises the question of the supply of cruisers to the Chinese Government.A. H.November 18, 1929.THE Chinese Government have entered into negotiations with Messrs. Vickers and Co. for the supply of a cruiser to cost  1,500.000, this being part of a building programme totalling  6,000,000 to be spread over ten years. Payment is, we are led to understand, to be made in bonds secured upon the revenues of the Maritime Customs. Messrs. Vickers have requested Messrs. Jardine Matheson and Co. to act as their agents in China for this business. Messrs. Jardine Matheson and Co. consider that it is deplorable that China, in the present state of her finances, should dissipate her resources on armaments, but argue that if she is determined to buy warships it is better that they should purchase them in England than elsewhere. The agency would be a lucrative one and would not involve Messrs. Jardine Matheson and Co. in any financial risk. They are, however, it is understood, reluctant to accept it unless they can be assured that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not view with disapproval their connexion with such business, and they have applied to the Foreign Office for a ruling on this point. If the cruiser is ordered it cannot be delivered to the Chinese Government without the licence of His Majesty&apos;s Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government must now therefore inform Messrs. Vickers and Messrs. Jardine Matheson and Co. either (1) that they approve, or (2) that they disapprove of the proposed transaction, or (3) that they prefer to express no opinion, but will issue the licence for the export of the cruisers when completed.There are various reasons which appear to make it essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should definitely disapprove of the transaction.China&apos;s Finances.The unsecured debts of the Chinese Government are estimated to amount to between 1,000 and 1,500 million dollars. A rough estimate of defaulting loans and obligations due to British creditors shows a total of over 100 million dollars outstanding as at the 31st December, 1928. The Nanking Government have continued the policy of the Peking Government of favouring domestic creditors, while deliberately ignoring prior foreign obligations. In the two years from May 1927 to March 1929 they issued domestic loans to the amount of 333 million dollars, thus exceeding the total amount of such loans issued by the Peking Government in the previous fourteen years. These loans have almost all been secured upon the Customs revenues which are thus fully pledged for several years ahead, making it certain that nothing will be available for prior foreign obligations.5716   [20172]
On the 14th July last His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Peking formally protested to the Chinese Government against the continued delay in making adequate provision fpr long-outstanding debts, coupled with unfair discrimination against foreign creditors by the constant issue of new domestic loans secured on the only available revenue. The French Government have proposed that a joint protest on the same lines should be made by the Consortium Powers (Great Britain, France, the United States of America and Japan), and Sir M. Lampson has been authorised to join with his colleagues in taking this step. If, therefore, the Chinese Government should now issue a further loan secured on Customs revenues for the purchase of cruisers, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be bound to enter a protest against the transaction.The Naval Contract of June 20, 1929.It would be regrettable from the point of-view of unemployment in this country if the order for these cruisers were placed abroad, but, in view of their naval disarmament policy, there are difficulties for His Majesty&apos;s Government in countenancing even tacitly the supply of cruisers by a British firm to the Chinese Government. Moreover, the contract above referred to would place them in a peculiarly invidious position if they adopted any such course. The contract, which was negotiated by the Admiralty, provided for the training of Chinese officers in the British navy and the sending of a British naval mission to China. Article 54 ran as follows : &apos;&apos; The Chinese Government hereby declare their intention, in the near future, to place substantial orders in Great Britain or Northern Ireland for the construction of ships for the Chinese navy.&quot;After the signature of the Agreement the Foreign Office proposed to issue a notification to the press in the following terms :  &quot; The Agreement announces the early construction in the United Kingdom of some vessels for the Chinese navy.&quot;At the request of the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following wording was substituted : &quot;It is understood that the Chinese Government have a comprehensive programme for the building of a substantial navy, and it is their intention to have some vessels constructed in Great Britain.&quot;An announcement of the conclusion of the Agreement, containing these words, was published in the press on the 2nd July. On the 19th August the Chinese Govern-ment transmitted through the Admiralty a telegram requesting Messrs. Vickers to submit estimates for two 6,000-ton cruisers. This has now developed into the proposal to purchase a cruiser costing 1^ million sterling with further orders to follow.Up to the time of the signature of the contract the Chinese clearly indicated that all they had in mind was the purchase of vessels that would be useful for anti-piracy measures and coast defence, and the change made by the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs in the wording of the announcement in the press was not taken as indicating any change in their intentions. Messrs .Vickers, however, might plausibly argue that they had every reason to suppose that one of the objects of the contract was to secure for British manufacturers the very kind of order which is now offered to them by the Chinese Government. On the other hand, if Messrs. Vickers are permitted to supply this cruiser and the subsequent vessels it will be difficult for Flis Majesty&apos;s Government to persuade the public to believe that that was not in fact the object they had in view when negotiating the contract. It is submitted therefore that no time should now be lost in intimating both to Messrs. Vickers and to Jardine Matheson and Co. that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not approve of any British firm supplying to the Chinese Government vessels other than those that would be suitable for general police purposes and for the suppression of piracy in Chinese waters, and further that no licence will be issued for the export of any vessels not answering to this description. The firms in question might be referred to the answer returned to a question in Parliament on this subject on the 10th July.
Answer to a Question in. Parliament on July 10, 1929.&apos;. The contract providing for the Naval Mission in question was negotiated with the approval of our predecessors in office. It is plain that the new Chinese Govern-ment will require certain naval armed forces for general police purposes and^,for the suppression of piracy in Chinese waters, which in recent years has proved, a serious problem, and it is proper for His Majesty&apos;s Government to assist them in any way in its power iji the organisation of such forces. His Majesty&apos;s Government have no information which leads them to believe that the Chinese Government intend to embark on naval expansion which would involve an armament competition of the kind which my hon. friend fears, and he may be sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government would in no circumstances encourage or participate in any such policy.
