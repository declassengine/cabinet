13 DOCUMENT IS  THB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAH1TIC MAJESTY *S government&amp;lEJfT) .COPY NO. 3^CABIITET . ATTMJAI HOLIDAY BILL. MEMORANDUM BY THE M33TIS.EBR&quot; OF LABOUR.1. A very large number of workpeople are never inthe sane employment or industry for twelve months. Clause 7 provides that the expression &quot;employed person&quot; means, inter alia, a person employed &quot;&quot;whether under one or more employers&quot;.      The question arises as to which of the employers is to he responsible for providing the eight clear consecutive days1 holiday and the payment therefor,..2. Twelve months1  employment is usually understood tobe employment without a break.      It is, however, very usual for breaks to occur.      It is true that, in the Bill, &quot;year&quot; means a term of twelve months calculated in the prescribed manner and it may be that it is intended that, when the number of days of. actual employment reaches a prescribed number, a. holiday shall be given.      This would clearly be difficult to administer and, if faithfully administered, might lead to a particular man whose holiday was about due to lose a chance of employment owing.to an employer being unwilling to undertake, himself, the liability for eight days-1 payment. 3. The question of holidays is closely -linked   withwages and agreements providing for holidays have usually been reached at a time when economic circumstances are such as to enable improved conditions to be made operative. Besides giving trade unions a suitable subject of   , collective bargaining, it is clearly better to deal with this subject industry by industry, taking into accountC R E T. . 320  (29).
the special circumstances, than to attempt a general regulation which may not he workable.     For example, in docks employment, the first necessary step is to make employment regular and of a more permanent character. Until that is done, holidays with pay are not possible unless paid for out of a general fund of some kind.In the present circumstances of employment in industry It is probable that holidays generally could only be dealt with by a general scheme such as that for unemployment. The question of how the holiday wages nza to be paid has probably not received sufficient attention by the promoters of ti-. t Bill.There is legislation in AustriaBelgium (mine-workers) Gzecko-SlcvakiaDenmark (State Officials and Domestic Servants) Finland (commerce, shops, Government employees) Poland RussiaSouth Africa (shops)In Australia, holidays are provided^ for In arbitrationawards;        The absence of the more important industrial countries from this list should be noted.      Where there arelaws, administration has proved to be most difficult.      Thegreatest real progress has been made in countries In whichcollective agreements and trade union action are the maininstruments.      Laws seem to be of little value withoutorganisation.      It may be noted, as a matter of interest,ofthat no means has been found/preventing a worker working for another employer during his vacation.Briefly, it may be said that substantial progress is being made by collective bargaining In this country and that, before legislation could be adopted,.careful and full inquiry would be necessary.(Intd.)
