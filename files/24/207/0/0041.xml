\   2BDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).ORE T. 350  (29),CABINET. SCHOOL LEAVING AGE,ja ..... i. ..... ,.....-..... .MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCES . Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,I desire to add a brief explanatory note to the 48      memorandum circulated by the President of the Board of Education. That memorandum represents the agreed conclusions of the President, the Secretory of State for Scotland and myself, arrived at after long discussions,  and as the result of a series of compromises on various points.     It must not,there-fore, be regarded as a mere preliminary essay embodying a minimm standard of expenditure that may readily be expanded upwards by further discussion at the Cabinet and outside.     The cost of raising the school age is so large that I have felt the greatest hesitation, on financial grounds, In agreeing to the proposals embodied In the President !s memorandum.I attach hereto figures which supplement the estimate in the President&apos;s memorandum, and explain the liabilities involved, at various dates.I must add a note on the proposal, referred to at the end of the President&apos;s memorandum, that the system of main-tenance allowances now to be established should be temporary. At present no maintenance allowances are recognised In Elementary Schools within the period of legal school age, because attendance is compulsory and universal and it has been the long-established custom to require attendance within the school age without, monetary compensation.     But at the moment when the school age is extended suddenly, parents have a special grievance, in that they have been expecting children&apos;s earnings at an early date and are suddenly deprived of them by Act ofParliament.      That is the only new circumstance that has-1 -COPY NO:
arisen.      What I have in mind, therefore,  is that the temporary hardship should be recognised by allowances for a definite period of five years.      This is the only alternative,  in my opinion,  to the establishment of a permanent system of allowances which It will be Impossible ever to withdraw and which may easily be extended in future years,  in various directions,  as the result of a series of concessions.      We must face the position fully,  and decide accordingly.      If we agree to the proposed temporary arrangement,  it will at any rate provide valuable experience of the industrial and social results of the new system of maintenance allowances,  and will reveal the re-actions In other directions.(Intd.)Treasury Chamber s,  S,W e1030th November,  1929.
APPEND!Cost of Raising the School Age.The cost will vary at different dates, according to the additional number of children on the school registers each year, between the ages of 14 and 15, and to the progress of schemes for providing new accommodation and teachers.On the basis proposed for maintenance allowances in the President1s memorandum,  and on the assumption that half the additional numbers on the registers will receive maintenance allowances of 5/- a week and that the State will pay SOfo of the cost of the allowances, the total cost of raising the School leaving age will be as follows:-(1) (2) (a) (4) (5)State cost (England &amp; Sales)Local cost ( England &amp; Wales)Additional Grant from St at e to Education (Scotland) Fundlotal cost to State (columns (2) &amp; (4))1932,.

9 7 pNOTES.(l)    In addition to the above figures, considerable further expenditure will probably result in secondary schools from the proposed new system of maintenance allowances in Elementary Sohools.     Only about 35% of the free place children in Secondary Schools get allowances at present; and the average allowance, In places other than London, is under 3/-a week.      If 50$ of the children between 14 and 15 In Elementary Schools get allowances of 5/- a week in future, similar results will be demanded in Secondary Schools.     The cost would be large, even without a disturbance of tho existing Exchequer grant of 50/0, which applies to Secondary School expenditure of all kinds.(2)    The above Table is also incomplete as giving no estimate of the large Local cost that will be involved InScotland.     The Secretary of State for Scotland considers thatthe number of children likely to receive allowances in Scotland will be more than 50$ and might be between 50$ and 80$.     Inaddition, there will be general expenditure, as in England.The total cost will clearly be a large sum each year.
