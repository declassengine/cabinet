MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.T think that it is important that before this subject is discussed further my colleagues should be apprised of the views and observations contained in the appended private telegram received by me from Lord Irwin, to whom I communicated personally and in confidence a summary of the proposals contained in Lord Passfield&apos;s Memorandum, CP. 308 (29). I have made so bold, therefore, as to circulate the telegram. ;A paraphrase of the Government of Indians official telegram of 14th October to which Lord Irvvin refers is also appended.W. B.ISth November 1920.Paraphrase telegram from Viceroy, dated Ltith November 1929.Private and personal. Secret. East Africa. Wilson&apos;s proposals, which Passfieid&apos;s closely resemble, have already been fully dealt with in Government of India&apos;s official telegram of 14th October. The arguments and conclusions set out there are clear and exhaustive ; but I should like to add the following comments : (a) Closer union. PassfielcTs scheme of joint councils with legislative powers to aid the High Commissioner in controlling economic services is, in my opinion, repugnant to the terms of the Tanganyika mandate (see Hilton-Young Report, Chapter 12) and far more likely to provoke foreign criticism than the purely administrative union proposed by the Hilton-Young Commission.(b) If European opposition to the ideal of a common electoral roll justifies the decision to, rule out the merging of existing communal registers as politically quite impracticable, Indian opposition to closer union and the disappearance of the official majority from the Kenya Council provides a reason no less strong for maintaining the status quo in East Africa.(c) Passfield&apos;s proposals, viewed collectively, involve a complete defeat for Indian claims on all three major points, viz. federation, common electoral roll, and composition of the Kenya Legislative Council. The disastrous effect of this on Indian opinion both in East-Africa and India at present juncture needs no elaborate description;(d) If any announcement is made about social survey as suggested, I presume that it would be made clear that in this matter it was not only the Indian community which was being surveyed, but that it was a comparative review of all immigrant communities.2. Should Passfiekfs views prevail, I would strongly urge you to press the Cabinet to reach no conclusions on contentious points, but refer them to a Joint Select Committee of Parliament before which we should be allowed as a special case to place the Indian view. Sir M. Habibullah and Sastri both strongly favour the view that we should be allowed to plead the Indian cause before the Committee.3. Finally, if the Cabinefs decision is adverse to Indian wishes, the question will have to be carefully considered of the date of making it public. Publication now, or before the Simon Commission^ Report has appeared, may undo much of the good achieved by my recent announcement. *Paraphrase telegram from Government of India, Department of Education, Health and Lands, to Secretary of State for India, dated 14th October 1929.Standing Emigration Committee met to discuss the situation created by Wilson&apos;s Report on 11th October.The necessity of holding the meeting shortly after the Assembly sittings terminated and holidays, resulted in the meeting being poorly attended, only Darcy Lindsay and Ram Saran Das being present. But a memorandum presented, by the ,East:A.african Indian delegation was before the Committee, and the views of Purshottam . ,     . -4086      75   11.29   &apos; ...     - .Printed for the Cabinet.    November 1929.SECRET.CP. 325(29).Closer Union in East Africa.
Das and Gidney were communicated in writing.   The advice of Gidney was to leave to the Colonial Office the further handling of the whole question ; apart from this, all views given agreed with those expressed at the last full meeting of the Emigration, Committee and in Assembly debate, and are practically identical with our own which are set out below.Wilson&apos;s Report gives us the general impression of evading the real issue, and that while apparently suggesting merely a co-ordination of economic interests, in reality it introduces (a) a scheme which must result in political union eventually, and (h) an alteration in the constitution of Kenya, which cannot fail to constitute a step towards responsible government in which European settlers will be in predominating position.Regarding the first point, notwithstanding Wilsou&apos;s statement that he found uncompromising opposition to political union amongst all communities, with the possible exception of Tanganyika, yet he makes the admission in several passages that the influence of his High Commissioner will be extended beyond economic interests (vide particularly p. It), para. 2v, and p. 29, first paragraph of Section VII). On express stipulation that appointment was not to be a step in the direction of complete political union, we did not in our telegram dated 19th March, No. 1124 S., offer opposition to appointment of Governor-General to co-ordinate economic interests and native policy. Our position must now be restated.In the first place, the whole balance is changed by excluding native policy from functions of central authority as proposed by Wilson. Secondly, regarding a central authority solely for economic interests we now feel certain after examining the matter more closely that the High Commissioner must gradually assume the guidance of central policj&apos;- unless he is to be merely a figurehead, for the reason that central policy is inextricably bound up with economic questions. Instancing one case only, decisions regarding any development policy such as, for example, railway rates and construction would certainly raise questions of European versus native interests. The following is accordingly a summary of ortr position : Bearing in mind, first, the essential relationship between political and economic union; secondly, the general antagonism to former which is admitted by Wilson ; thirdly, the suspicious atmosphere which has been created here by Wilson&apos;s Mission and the way Commission^ Report has been treated ; fourthly, as we explain in succeeding paragraph, having regard to conditions which Kenya settlers are endeavouring to impose, we would strongly press for the preservation of present conditions for the time being until all classes of local opinion have calmed down and accepted and digested fresh ideas with all they imply. We are sceptical of vital local interests being endangered by delay, for we find it impossible to think that the requisite co-ordination of economic policy could not be obtained by the continuation of the Governors conferences, subject perhaps to the Secretary of State maintaining closer oontact and supervision than hitherto. Should His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, decide now or in the future to bring about economic union on the lines of the Wilson Report then all political implications of this move must be faced, and the responsibility for inter-racial justice and protection of minorities in local legislatures must rest with the High Commissioner, who must also be guided by a council which fully aud fairly represents the interests of all communities.lu that event we shall have to press that from all three territories Indians shall be strongly represented.   This point has been altogether ignored by Wilson.We must make the following comments on the second of our two points : (a) TVilson&apos;s plain admission that Kenya Europeans would only consider any scheme for closer union conditionally on the abandonment of the official majority in Kenya Council undermines his proposal of co-ordination of economic interests. The two points have no logical connection, and if it is genuinely believed that union of economic services Avill be for public benefit in all three territories then it should receive unconditional support. Obviously, however, Kenya settlers expect to use their support for a scheme initiated not by themselves but by His Majesty&apos;s Government to enable them to bargain to obtain what they want in Kenya Legislative Council. This point which has been noticed here puts the whole plan for economic union under great suspicion. (6) To Wilson&apos;s actual proposals for the composition of the Kenya Legislative Council we must offer our unqualified opposition. Like the Hilton-Young Minority Report, the absolute majority would, we fear, under.his plan lie with the unofficial Europeans&apos;.&apos; Although we welcome Wilson&apos;s proposal that unofficial representatives of general interests should be selected irrespective of race, in the present atmosphere in Kenya we cannot avoid the conclusion that with only rare
-exceptions these representatives would be Europeans. The arguments against this result need not be reiterated; it must not only be rejected as a move towards responsible government dominated by a small white community, but would in -addition be grossly unfair to Indian interests even from the commencement. Further,, we must call attention to the fact that though we had originally been disposed to consider favourably the Majority Report proposals for native interests to be represented by unofficials, that favourable consideration rested on the assumption that both sides would adopt and work the scheme as a whole with goodwill. Events which followed, such as the way the Report was received by Europeans in Kenya, Wilson&apos;s Mission and the statements he is reported to have made to Kenya Indians, and lastly his present report, have not only shattered our confidence in this possibility, but have rendered it out of the question to convince public opinion here, that in event of unofficial Europeans being appointed as native representatives, that they will not really be the representatives of European against Indian interests in matters between Indians and Europeans. Stipulation that a substantial proportion of the nominated unofficials must be Indians is the only manner in which objections -based on above ground could be met. At the same time our feeling is that it would be unsatisfactory to allocate to non-natives seats reserved for representatives of natives on a communal basis; we have drawn the attention of the Emigration -Committee to this point.Taking everything into consideration we must emphatically press not only for the rejection of WiJson&apos;s proposals, but that the official majority in the Kenya Council shall not be abandoned until (1) principle of a common electoral roll for Europeans -and Iudians is decided in a manner satisfactory to Indians, (2) principal points of native policy have been decided and a proper scheme which meets with the approval -of Indian opinion for Council representation native interests has been devised. The first of these conditions of course concerns us more directly, but Indian opinion is keenly interested also in the second, having regard both to native interests themselves -and to effect on Indian proportion in the Council of additional native representatives.The fact that Wilson&apos;s report fails to clarify the main issues or to face all the implications of his proposals strengthens us in our endorsement of our previous recommendation that whole question of policy in East Africa should be submitted to a Joint Parliamentary Committee before His Majesty&apos;s Government take any decisions.Reverting to your reply No. 2967, dated 24th September,, to our 2871 S. of the same date regarding the common roll. In the first place, it is recognised by us that there might be unfortunate reactions at the present stage if a public announcement were made of determination to press for enforcement of common roll in face of opposition of local European opinion, and Government speakers here in recent debates have strongly urged that appeals to reason and attempt to devise some generally acceptable scheme and. to create better atmosphere should not be abandoned yet. But on our side principle of a common roll must be unconditionally supported now as in 1920 and 1923 ; and we must publicly reassert principles by which the Government of India have always stood hitherto unless we can at least obtain from His Majesty&apos;s Government a declaration of policy endorsing the Hilton-Young Commission Majority Report view that the ultimate ideal is a common roll by consent coupled with an assurance that His Majesty&apos;s Government will do everything they can to achieve that object, and that they will as a first step hold an inquiry preliminary to adoption of civilisation test. Unless we do this we cannot expect public opinion here to be satisfied. Nor can a policy of silence be reconciled with our obligation to protect Indian interests, or with our belief that the principles themselves are just.That there are practical difficulties in reaching any measure of agreement we, of -course, recognise, especially in view of the existing hostile atmosphere to the Commission^ Report in Kenya among the Europeans and of the hope Wilson&apos;s visit &quot;has apparently raised among them. At the same time we must constantly press that this matter should be pursued without neglecting any opportunity that may arise ; meanwhile, the least we can do is to maintain our attitude as outlined above, that until the principle of the common roll has been adopted there must be no constitutional change tending to weaken official control in the Kenya Legislature.Secondly. With regard to representation of natives by officials you suggest that we have ignored, in our recent demands that until natives can represent themselves non-officials shall not be substituted, the grounds on which the recommendations of the Commission were based. But the views of the majority of the Commission are, as -we understand them, that their recommendations regarding the substitution in the
Kenya Legislature of officials by non-officials must be considered as one part only of an integral scheme and that if the scheme is not adopted as a whole, case for this recommendation was creation of a strong central authority to act as arbiter in any case of conflicting racial interests and responsible directly to Imperial Government. European settlers&apos; attitude and other happenings following publication of Commission&apos;^ Report show that these recommendations stand little chance of being carried out in the spirit the Commission intended, while this pi-actical difficulty for the High Commissioner is deliberately negatived by Wilson&apos;s Report. We are convinced that in the circumstances the only safe course for us to follow is the attitude we have adopted above. That attitude is the only one with which public opinion here will he satisfied or which will avoid placing in jeopardy the principles for which our unequivocal support must be maintained.With regard to question of appointment of Indians to public services we have never suggested that there should be any question of appointing Indians on communal basis. From your telegram No. 2967, dated 24th September, it is understood that, provided they are validly qualified, Indians are not debarred from appointment to higher posts in public services. If this is correct, we would suggest that an announcement to this effect should be made publicly both in East Africa and England and that we should be given authority to make a like announcement here in view of the feeling amongst Indian community both in East Africa and in this country on this subject.
