Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1929.SECRET.O.P. 326 (29). *THE COALFIELDS DISTRESS FUND.Memorandum by the Treasury.(Circulated by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with reference to cabinet 49 (29), Conclusion 4.)I. IT is understood that consideration is now being given to the question of making a further money grant for the relief of the distressed mining areas and in particular those of South Wales, Durham and Northumberland. Some impressions formed during the administration of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund may therefore not be out of place.II. Two main issues seem to arise : -(i.) How far is the sum available in the Fund adequate to meet the need in the coming winter ?(ii.) Would the Committee for the Fund be prepared to administer a further grant if placed at their disposal ?III. -Any precise answer to the first question is difficult. Obviously &quot;adequate&quot; and &quot;need&quot; are relative terms, and no two people hold quite the same views as to their values.It will be appreciated that the organisation of the Fund as such is hardly in a position to ^express an opinion based on a detailed and scientific survey. It has only a skeleton salaried staff, and has neither the time nor the means to carry out the proper investigations into the density, volume and degree of distress that should be made before any really valuable answer can be given as to the adequacy or otherwise of the sum available. Many Secretaries of Local Committees at interviews have even been unable to give figures of unemployment in the areas covered by their Committee. This ignorance of the most easily ascertainable criterion of distress would not, however, prevent the majority of Secretaries and Committees giving an affirmative answer if they were asked in public or as a Committee whether they required further money for their area from some outside source.IV. In spite, however, of these deficiencies, constant intercourse in the last year with persons of all kinds in many distressed areas widely separated has led to certain general conclusions on this matter.There seems to be a rather widespread uneasiness as to the position this winter because the Fund spent in round figures some  900,000 on the provision of boots and clothing in the first six months of this year, but now has only  500,000* to meet the needs of the present winter. This anxiety is due to a lack of knowledge of all the facts, notably : (1.) At the beginning of the year there was admittedly a great deal of leeway to make up, and (2) the intense interest aroused by the Fund, the stimulation caused by the Christmas broadcast message and personal visits to the North of the Prince of Wales, the irritation arising from what appeared to be an unduly slow start in the work (necessitated in fact by the complete absence of any appropriate spending organisation) and the constant pressure applied by Members of Parliament and others were all undoubtedly reflected in the &quot;open hand&quot; methods of the Committees once they did start.  For two or three months there was little control orCopy No.        29CABINET.[20180]* Actually  600,000 (see Appendix II).b
restraint, and there is no doubt that assistance was given from the Fund in far too lavish a manner, and that many families were helped who had no real claim upon a charitable Fund. In more than one area help was given to families regardless of whether the man was employed or not. Outfit grants were provided in some cases up to a value of  10, and in very many cases up to  5, whereas now by general agreement an average figure of about 30/- is regarded as fully adequate to meet essential requirements. Such grants were not infrequently made more than once to the same person within a few weeks. These conditions will not, of course, recur in the coming winter, and there is no doubt that  500,000 will go very much further in relieving genuine distress than it did last winter. Moreover, as is shown in Appendix II, the actual sum to be expended will probably be nearer  600,000 than  500,000.V. Account must also be taken of the psychological effect on the administrator. Last winter all Committees of the Fund were encouraged to apply for further grants as soon as they had exhausted their first grant. They were in fact given an open cheque; The feeling of illimitable resources was in the air. This winter Committees appreciate that the amount available is strictly limited, and with this smaller sum administration is likely to be more prudent, and assistance confined to really deserving cases. Incidentally and this is rather important the feeling that there is a limit to the Fund will disappear on any suggestion of a further Exchequer grant. On many occasions during the past few months the policy of the Central Committee to curtail activities during the summer in order to be in a position to operate this winter was criticised by members of Local Committees on the ground that the Fund should be spent forthwith, and that on its exhaustion the Government would provide further money.VI. The two areas which have hitherto been regarded as those in greatest distress have both made estimates of their requirements for the whole of next winter. South Wales consider they will require  250,000 and Durham and Northumberland  110,000 to  120,000. The South Wales estimate provides for a complete issue of boots and the more important articles of clothing to a minimum of 40,000 men, 35,000 women and 60,000 children, the latter to get an extra pair of boots, making two pairs in all. These figures compare with a total number of unemployed men and women in the area covered of 52,000.The estimate for Durham and Northumberland is based on a comparison of the present unemployment figures with those of last winter, and of the expenditure last winter, after making some allowance for the &quot;open cheque&quot; method of administration by Committees in the spring, and for the exclusion from assistance in the coming winter save in quite exceptional circumstances of families where the wage earner is in full time work.South Wales is likely to receive between  220,000 and  250,000, and Durham and Northumberland their full requirements. If the demands of these areas are well founded the resources of the Fund are clearly not inadequate to meet them.VII. It will not, of course, be overlooked that there has been a very marked improvement in both these coalfields in the past year. Some detailed figures of unemployment are given in Appendix I, of which the following is a summary : South Wales.	Colliery Workers in Depressed Areas.		All other Workers in Depressed Areas.		Total.

The Committee consider that in the mining areas, as in all other parts of the country, men in full work must face their responsibilities, difficult though it may be. The Fund cannot be used as a temporary palliative for what, for the time being anyhow, are stable economic conditions.Now, to carry out this work without putting the unemployed man (and his dependents) in a much better position than the employed man, will not require a very large sum. By almost every Local Committee that has been visited in all the mining areas, the statement has been made : &quot; The unemployed man is better off than the man in work.&quot; The prevalence of this belief is quite remarkable. On close investigation it cannot generally be substantiated provided the unemployed man is pajung his rent. But the margin between the two is small. An unemployed man with wife and four children receives 32/- per week unemployment-benefit. He does not pay the following charges, which fall on the employed man : National Health and Unemployment Insurance contributions, subscriptions to Trade Union, Club, Nursing Association, Aged Miners&apos; Homes, upkeep of tools, &amp;c, arrears of rent or other debts contracted in previous periods of unemployment or stoppages of work. The wear and tear on his boots and clothing is less than in the case of his working neighbour. These charges absorb a considerable part of the difference between 32/- and, say, 38/- to 42/- or 44/-, or even 46/-, a normal weekly wage for labour in many parts of the country.If, in addition, the unemployed man does not pay his rent (and the eviction of the famity of such a man for non-payment of rent in an industrial area is almost unthinkable), he is definitely better off than many employed men (though he is accumulating further difficulties for himself when he does resume work). He is also better off than the man who is working four days a week.The conclusion from this state of affairs is that a relatively small sum will, in fact, put the families of unemployed men on the same footing as those of many employed men (if, indeed, this is the desired end); and that if a large grant is to be made available it can only be used either for placing the families of men who are out of work in a definitely better position than those of many thousands of men who are in work, or for indiscriminate assistance in its area of application to families whether the wage earner is at work or not.With these considerations in view, therefore, it may be concluded that the resources of the Fund are probably adequate. Both South Wales and Durham and Northumberland will receive in the winter between  3 and  4 per head of the unemployed in their area in October. Not all of these unemployed will require assistance. The figures include single men, men involved in temporary stoppages, men with only one or two children, and men who have sons or daughters at work and. [20180] b 2
contributing to the family income. The grants that will be available for these areas may well work out at the equivalent of about  4 to  5 per family assisted, and this is surely an adequate figure, coming as it does on top of more generous provision in the first six months of this year.IX.-So far the question of adequacy has been considered mainly from the standpoint of South Wales, Durham and Northumberland, and it is understood that it would be to those areas that any supplementary grants would go. But an examina-tioh of the figures shows that those are the only mining areas in which there has been a substantial improvement in the situation in the past few months. Whilst they have gone forward, the other mining areas, of which Lancashire and Yorkshire are much the largest, have remained substantially as they were or have gone back. This is clearly shown by the returns of employment: Coalfields.	Wage Earners.				1928.		1929.		September 8.	October 6.	October 5.	October 26.Durham and Northumberland	172,800	173,700	188,400	189,000South Wales	161,800	163,600	175,400	173,500Lancashire   ..          ..           ..	90,800	90,500	90,500	90,900Yorkshire	169,000	163,700	109,100	169,600Moreover, the actual unemployment figures in the parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire covered by the Fund show that the size of the problem in those areas is certainly not negligible compared to South Wales and Durham. Thus the approximate figures, which may be taken as a rough guide, but on which too much reliance must not be placed, for the unemployed in these four areas in the middle of September were : South Wales     ...         ... ... ... 64,000Durham and Northumberland ... ... 38,000Yorkshire          ...          ... ... ... 29,000Lancashire        ...          ... ... ... 33,700The figures for Lancashire have since become worse.These figures make it difficult to justify further special treatment for South Wales and Durham, and any grant for mining areas would have to be extended to Lancashire and Yorkshire and probably to all mining areas. The most distressed mining area, though one of the smallest, is probably the one in Cumberland round Workington and Whitehaven.X. This consideration leads naturally to the greatest difficulty of all in connection with Government grants towards distress, namely, at what point or place are they to stop ?It has been painfully obvious to everyone connected with the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund that assistance has had to be withheld from a number of places with probably greater claims on merits than some to which it has been given.By the terms of the original appeals the Committee for the administration of the Fund have felt obliged to restrict its operation to the &quot;mining areas.&quot; This has inevitably caused many serious anomalies and much potential hardship. The state of the distressed in Middlesbrough, for example, becomes to those concerned far more acute than it previously was when they realise that persons similarly situated but 10 or 15 miles away are receiving a good deal of help from some outside source. Middlesbrough is but one example and not the most important. A momenfs consideration will show the difficulties of dealing with such places as Newcastle, the shipbuilding and engineering towns all along the Tyneside, the iron and steel areas oh the Tees, shipbuilding, &amp;c, at Barrow, the position of large towns in the
West Riding, such as Sheffield, Leeds, Huddersfielcl, Rotherharn, the many large towns in Lancashire; adjoining mining centres and Cardiff :and Newport in South Wales. The Central Committee of the Fund, in the face of a number of moving and influential appeals, has almost entirely excluded these centres, sheltering themselves behind the terms of the appeal, but actually realising that if &apos;&apos; distress &apos;&apos; was to be relieved in them on the same scale that has applied in the mining areas no limit could be^set to the sum of money required.This restriction is practicable for a Committee administering a Fund strictly in accordance with the terms on which it was subscribed, but it would surely be quite impossible to apply it to an Exchequer grant in view of the huge sums that have already been spent in the mining areas, and also of the fact that the general unemployment statistics over the country as a whole show clearly that the centre of depression has moved from the coalfields, of which South Wales and Durham in particular have benefited from the trade revival and the transfer of labour.Once the principle of an Exchequer grant for the relief of distress is admitted there will follow an avalanche of applications from industrial centres in South Wales, the Midlands and the North of England. If a relatively small grant is set aside-it can be distributed either by giving a reasonable sum to a small number of places or by spreading it in small amounts over a large number. The first method  assuming a solution to the problem of selection will create a fresh batch of anomalies and still further intensify the sense of grievance felt by all excluded places. The second method will yield such small sums that they will be obviously inadequate in the eyes of the recipients and will be unfavourably received. Both methods will lead to cumulative pressure for a further and larger grant.XL There a,re two other considerations of a more general character which are relevant in considering the present extent of the distress and the adequacy of existing resources in the Fund :  (i.) In January the Committee were informed that in South Wales and Durham large numbers of children were suffering from malnutrition and that school feeding would be started or, if already started, would be extended if it were not for the inability of the Local Authorities to raise the necessary funds. An arrangement was therefore made by which in effect with the same expenditure from Local Funds an Education Authority with the help of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund was able to feed 50 per cent, more children than before. But in some places it was found on review at the end of the summer that so far from the number of children fed going up 50 per cent, it had actually gone down, in one case in one of the worst parts of Wales from 424 to 48. This result indicates either a very remarkable improvement in the physical state of the children or more probably a determination to use funds provided from some outside source in alleviation of the rates. Neither alternative appears to justify further grants of public money to these areas, though the Fund, subject to certain revised conditions, is continuing to help them until the end of next March.(ii.) Recent reports from the Medical Inspectors of the Board of Education have indicated on the whole a definite though slight improvement in the health and condition of the children in South Wales, but the reports for nearly every school inspected have contained adverse, comments on the state of the children&apos;s boots and, by implication, criticism on the ability of the fund to meet the needs. The reports, however, contain no reference to the economic position of the parents. On the other hand, reports from the various localities make it quite clear that there is a growing tendency to demand the provision of boots for children as a right. Cases have occurred in which children have been deliberately kept away from school-in order to force the Local Committee of the Fund to supply boots. Secretaries and Members of Local Committees have been stopped in the streets with a demand for assistance. In spite of the distribution in South Wales between the beginning of February and the end of May of 116,000 pairs of children&apos;s boots and of the marked improvement in industrial conditions, the reports from the Board of Education^ Medical Inspector seem to indicate that the footwear position is little if any better than it was a year ago. &quot;There is a[20180]
- clear .elanger that no net improvement in the area will occur so long as the&apos;   . Lord Mayors Lund or any other large resources are thought to beavailable. Lor every necessitous parent whose child is provided with a pair of boots there will be at least one other parent who will consider:? that provision should be made for his child as well.   Caution is therefore necessary in taking the state of the boots at school as a criterion of the distress prevalent in a district where a large Fund for the provision of boots in necessitous cases has been in operation for some time.XII. Something should perhaps be said about the possibility of the Central Joint Committee of the Fund administering a further grant the difficulty about its restriction to mining areas being for the moment overlooked.While appreciating in a high degree the public spirit and self-sacrifice of over 5,000 voluntary helpers who have served on the Local Committees of the Fund, it must be admitted that an organisation of this kind cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory. It certainly could not be expected to function indefinitely, even if this was desirable.The Secretarial and Accounting work for the Local Committees is being carried out by officials with many other duties, and whilst there is a willingness on the part of all concerned to provide assistance for those in need, there is a natural reluctance to go to the trouble of a careful scrutiny, and a definite prejudice against the clerical work necessary if any intelligible statistical record is to be maintained. The staff, being voluntary and unpaid, can be controlled only by persuasion. Any adverse criticism following lax administration results in resignation of a thankless office, and replacement is a matter of great difficulty.The audit of the operations of the Committee is for obvious reasons somewhat inadequate. There is a partial audit, that is to say, expenditure and receipts are reconciled to the satisfaction of the auditors, and any expenditure on an unauthorised service would probably be disclosed, e.g., the distribution of cash instead of vouchers, the issue of food vouchers, where such an issue had not been authorised by the Divisional Committee. On the other hand, assistance given to individuals who ought not to have had it would not normally be discovered.Where the Fund is being used with discrimination the machinery tends to work too slowly. Too much time is apt to elapse between the discovery of genuine distress and the provision of assistance.. Where the machinery works quickly, it generally does so at the expense of careful administration, as it did in the early months of the year. Practically the whole work of the Fund falls within the statutory functions of Boards of Guardians. These Boards have corporate experience of the work and a salaried staff of officers at their disposal. It is too much to expect that an attempt to carry out their work without their experience or their staff can be wholly successful. The Local Committees which have been most efficient are those which were able to enlist for the work the voluntary help of School Attendance officers and Relieving officers.The Central Committee are not unaware of these difficulties and deficiencies. Whilst it is impossible to speak for them until they have been consulted, all the indications point to their being reluctant to undertake the administration of a further sum, and it is thought that they would therefore deprecate any additional grant to them.At a recent meeting of the Committee the question of a possible special appeal for a Xmas distribution was raised. The proposal was not supported by any members present and rejected. The feeling was obviously very much against any action which would suggest that the Fund was being reopened.XIII. Summing up, therefore, it may be said that (1.) The organisation of the Lord. Mayor&apos;s Fund has on the whole successfully met the special circumstances of its creation, but it overlaps with the organisation of the Boards of Guardians and is not a highly efficient piece of machinery.(2.) Although only  600,000 is likely to be spent in the mining areas in the coming winter compared with  900,000 in the first six months of this year, the sum available will go very much further with improved administration than it would have done last winter, and the sum . expended last winter included provision to meet distress accumulated over a number of years.
(3.) If assistance is to be normally restricted to families of unemployed and not extended to families of men at work, the sum required is not likely to be enormous, since in many cases the margin between the two classes is not very wide.(4.) The needs of Durham, Northumberland and South Wales as estimated by the Divisional Committees of the Fund in those areas are likely to be met in full.(5.) There has been a marked improvement in employment in those areas,&apos; whereas the situation in the other mining areas is generally unchanged, and in the country as a whole it shows a decline.(6.) The restriction of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund, by the terms of its appeal, to the mining areas has created many serious anomalies and potential hardships, which would be aggravated if further large sums were made available on the same terms.(7.) There is already a marked tendency in these areas to look upon the existence of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund or some equivalent as a permanent arrange-ment providing as of right assistance to persons who in other parts of the country are left to meet their responsibilities unaided.(8.) The Central Committee is unlikely to advise the Lord Mayor to reopen the Fund and commence a fresh appeal.XIV.

APPENDIX II.Expenditure during Winter 1929-30.1. At the&quot; end of September the available balance in the Fund in London, including interest maturing on the 3rd October, but after allowing provision for outstanding commitments, was  629,000.2.   The Central Committee have decided to employ this sum as follows : Not exceeding .(a.) Supplementary feeding at school and Juvenile Unem-ployment Centres in South Wales and Durham up till March 31, 1930 ... ... ... ...      25,000(&amp;.) Expenditure in providing assistance for the cultivation of allotments in all mining areas in 1930 ...      20,000(c.) Expenditure on school camp in the summer of 1930 for the areas of South Wales, Durham and Northumber-land, Lancashire and Yorkshire ...      10,000(d.) Reserve; to include any expenditure on social welfarework ... ... ... ... ...      60,000115,0003. This leaves a balance available for the provision of assistance by Local Committees of at least  514,000. Briefly, the assistance takes the form of supplying boots and the major articles of clothing to the children and wives of unemployed men, who can themselves receive boots and clothing, but on a more limited scale. There is a further scheme under which Local Committees can give help in cases of sickness, maternity or other special circumstances and can provide an outfit or equipment (subject to certain prescribed limits) for men and women proceeding to take up work after a long period of unemployment.4. For this work grants have been made and balances exist, as shown in the following tables : Final Grants.Divisional Committee for 	Previously received.

It will be seen that the estimate provides for an estimated total for grants of  519,000, against the available figure mentioned in paragraph 3 of at least  514,000. But the actual grants to the areas will probably be several thousands in excess of  519,000, for surpluses are fairly certain to be available on items (a), (&amp;) and (c) in paragraph 2, which are generous estimates based on the estimated expenditure in the current year. The actual expenditure is proving to be less than these estimates. Further, item (d) is to be modified at a forthcoming meeting of the Central Committee and will probably be reduced to  30,000, and interest in London and at the Divisional Committee Headquarters should add between one thousand and two thousand pounds.- It may, therefore, be said with safety at this stage that the grants to be made to the various areas this winter will not be less than  550,000, and that, with the balances in hand, the sums available for the work in those areas will approximate to  600,000.* Estimated, subject to verification.
