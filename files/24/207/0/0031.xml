COAL.MR. WARHAM stated that the weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom for the week ended October 12th was 5,179,000 tons, for the week ended October 19th, 5,126,000 tons and for the week ended October 26th, 5,138,000 tons - all above the 5,000,000 mark.   The average weekly output for the eight weeks ended October 26th was 5,124,000 tons, as compared with 4,730,000 tons for the corresponding period of last year, and with a weekly average output in 1913 of 5,526,000 tons.    The number of persons employed in the industry for the week ended October 26th was 938,100, equal to 84.5^ of the 1913 figures. Unemployment for the month of September was 14.6%, as compared with 15.6% in August and 21,9$ for the average of 1928.    The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom (excluding, the Irish Free State) in September was 4,973,630 tons, as compared with 4,778,009 tons in August.    The value per ton f.o.b. in September was 16/-   as against 15/9 in August. Exports from the United Kingdom for the ten months ended 31st October (including the Irish Free State) amounted to 49,885,000 tons, an increase over the 10 months ended October 1928 of 8,245,000 tons.    That was a satisfactory improvement. The principal increases were to Sweden, Norway and Denmark, 1,094,500 tons;   Holland nearly 600,000 tons;   Belgium 1,520,000 tons;   France 3,043,000 tons and Italy 400,000 tons. The   value of the exports in this period increased by  7% million as compared with last year.    Canada took lll,00o&quot;tons more than last year, but 104,000 tons less than in 1927. British exporters to Canada had lost a good deal of money towards the end of this season, chiefly owing to having to pay much higher freights than they had estimated, largely as a result of the operations of the Canadian Wheat Pool, and some of them were a good deal out of pocket in consequence.Exports by sea from Poland showed a decrease of 37,000 tons in September as compared with August.    Scandinavia was where we felt the Polish competition most and It was interest-ing to note that our exports to Scandinavia In September increased by 32,000 tons as compared with August, an increase nearly equivalent to the Polish decrease.    Except in September, Poland was continuing to hold all her export markets and was exporting now at the rate of 9,000,000 tons a year as against 25,000 tons in 1925.    This phenomenal Increase could be accounted for by the general expansion of Industry in Europe and the desire of buyers abroad to accumulate stocks against a recurrence of a winter such as last year.    Exports from Germany, to all destinations, continued to increase, the figures for July being 2,347,000 tons, August 2,502,000 tons and September 2,645,000 tons.    Exports of coal from the United Kingdom to Australia in Septenber were 38,000 tons, which showed a considerable falling off as compared with 70,000 tons for the previous month.    They had not had any enquiry at all for some time, but that morning he had heard by telephone that an enquiry for another big cargo had been received.    It appeared that buyers in Australia had been endeavouring to hold out till the strike there should be settled, but could now hold out no longer.    The demand for coal for export from the North
X 6 Cj)CONF IDENTIAL. COAL  (CONTD.).Bast of England and the East Coast of Scotland continued good, but sales for next year were being held up by the uncertainty of the present position.   .Great difficulty was being experienced in the North of England at the present time owing to the scarcity of suitable miners for the pits.   Most of the collieries were complain-ing that they could not get skilled men and the difficulty of getting boys was becoming serious.    The same difficulty was also being experienced on the Continent, and in both Holland and Belgium Polish miners were being brought in to supply the lack of suitable labour.    In one of the pits in the Worth a fortnight ago 102 ooal getters had to be employed in doing pullers work - work that was usually done by unskilled men and boys.    The flow of boys into the pits to be trained as skilled workers had not continued and from two to four hundred more boys were wanted.   He had consulted members of the coal trade In different parts of the country and they practically all   said the same thing.   Apparently parents were warning their boys not to go into the coal trade on account of the disturbances, the 1926 dispute still being in their minds.THE PRESIDENT asked if it was a question of wages as compared with those in other industries.    In the mining areas, or In many of them, there were considerable numbers of unemployed miners.   Was there any method of absorbing those men?MR. WARHAM thought the difficulty was that many of the men who were called unemployed miners at the present time were not really miners and were not fit to go into the pits. It was partly a question of physique, and some of course were unemployed on account of old age, but many had been discharged because they did not attend to their work and others because they were not fit for the work.MR. MITCHELL stated that the coal trade in Scotland continued in much the same condition as in recent months. There was a fair demand, but no anxiety to buy for shipment for forward delivery.    The prices for shipment for forward delivery were not very satisfactory and the prices for home sales were about the same as at this time last year.   Much time had been lost, especially on the East Coast, in October for want of tonnage, but there was now an improvement, and shipments in the last week were good.    Output generally had been rather better.    He confirmed what Mr.Warham had said as to miners registered as unemployed.    There were very few of the miners unemployed who were really miners and satisfactory workers.     They did not have the same difficulty in Scotland as on the North East Coast about boys, because the system of working was different.
HiCOAL (CONTD).PULVERISED FUEL.MR, ALEXANDER SHAW read the following report from one who was actively engaged in developing the use of pulverised coal: -&quot;During the last year or so, our Research Department has devoted a considerable amount of time to carrying out tests in connection with pulverised fuel.   About a year ago we fitted three boilers in the s.s.&quot;Hororata&quot;. This ship has now made two voyages to New Zealand and back and steamed over 50,000 miles, which has clearly demonstrated the fact that coal in pulverised form can be burnt In marine boilers.We were, however, not satisfied with the mechanical means of handling and pulverising the ooal and therefore we have carried out exhaustive tests with different types of mills, including American, German and Frenoh, and a number of mills made in this country.   While some of these mills were able to grind satisfactorily, we found it difficult to get a mill that would (1) retain an efficiency over a long period (2) be economical in upkeep and (3) require only a small amount of power to do its work.     We were unable to get any mill that would answer to these requirements, so we decided to design a mill of our own.    I am pleased to report that we have now achieved success in this direction.   We have recently completed a design with which we have carried out a very severe test as to reliability, fine grade of pulverising and low power cost.    These, In our opinion, are the essential conditions precedent to the adoption of pulverised coal at sea and we feel satisfied that we are now in a position to go forward with schemes for the mechanical handling, pulverising and burning of coal, -with confidence.   We are arranging to complete the fitting of the &quot;Hororata&quot; at once and I firmly believe that we shall be able to show that coal, of a reasonable volatility, can be burned as simply as oil is burned to-day.I feel confident (if It is possible to secure the co-operation of the coal mining industry and the ooal distributing companies, for the supply of coal in a crushed condition and the use of Improved methods of handling from the ooal mine to the ships &apos; bunkers) that we shall be able to make a greater step forward In the use of ooal for steam raising than has ever been made since oil fuel was first introduced.Briefly, I consider that coal eventually will need to be crushed as it comes from the mine and new methods of bunkering on board ship should be devised.   As you are aware, the great trouble of using coal on board passenger ships is on account of the dirt due to bunkering.   ThiB could be obviated if coal were put on board in a orushed state and I maintain that with properly designed appliances coal can be pumped almost as easily as oil is being pumped to-day.
i a coal (CONTD).PULVERISED FUEL (CONTD).The advantage of crushed coal Is that It can go in the same space, practically, as ordinary coal, whereas if coal is pulverised on shore and pumped on board It requires roughly 30$?&apos; more space, besides, in my opinion, other Berious disadvantages.&quot;It was crushed, Mr. Shaw explained, to something like two inches; that wag &quot;crushing&quot; as apart from &quot;pulverising&quot;.    One of the companies with which he was connected. was now laying down two cargo ships, which from the start would be designed to use pulverised fuel.   Looking to the future, it seemed essential, if pulverised coal was to have a proper chance, that there should be co-operation between the firms responsible for the pulverising plants and the coal industry, so that at the various ports it would be possible to obtain coal already crushed.   That would do away with the neoessity for heavy crushing equipment on board the ship and had other advantages to which the writer of the memorandum he had quoted had referred.-It was proposed, If crushed coal could he obtained readily in this country, to lay down stocks at the various cealing ports throughout the East, so that vessels would be able to take up crushed coal as they took up ordinary coal now.MR. WARHAM observed that the Mining Association had a Committee now In being to go into this very question in co-operation with boiler makers, shipowners and others and that Committee had been sitting for the last two years.   They would be glad to co-operate with Mr. Shaw and the Chamber of Shipping on the particular points he had mentioned.   He was pleased to hear that boats were being built for the purpose of burning pulverised coal.   Hitherto, with two exceptions lately, the steamers that had been using It had been converted from other methods and were not well designed for the purpose.MR. MITCHELL said it was not necessary to crush coal, because coal of the size required was available now.   A purchase had recently been made of &quot;single nuts&quot; for this purpose, which varied from about 1^ inches down to about 7/8&quot;, and that, he understood, was just the suitable size for the purpose.   The specification was for a certain number of British Thermal Units and of a certain size.    Of course if the demand were to grow very much, It might be necessary to crush coal specially, but in the meantime there was sufficient available without crushing.IRON AND STEEL.MR. BOND wrote:-&quot;Iron and steel markets have been distinctly quieter during October than for the previous few months.   Conclusive evidence of this is to be found in the decision of the International Steel Cartel to reduce quotas as from November 1st by 10 per cent.    This reduction In itself, however, gave some support to the tone of the market since it was evidence
IRON AND STEEL (OONTD.)that the producers had the situation in hand and were not disposed to permit over-production with its consequent excessive falls in prices.   The quieter market conditions, have however, not operated long enough to affect production and although complete returns are not yet available it is estimated that the production of steel in the United Kingdom in October was in the neighbourhood of 880,000 tons or some 30,000 tons more than in September and 20,000 tons more than in March, the previous highest for the year.&quot;On the North East Coast there has been some improvement in shipbuilding, but on the other hand the demand for structural and other purposes has been declining and consumers specifications from structural engineers are coming In but slowly.   The total demand for steel for the home trade is, therefore, not improving.   Export business continues quiet and Continental competition is very active and Continental prices showed a considerable drop during the month.    British makers of semis, therefore, are likely to see reduced demand for British bars.&quot;Prices for raw materials, especially coke, continue to show an upward tendency while the prices for saleable products remain unchanged.   The prospects for November and the ensuing three months on the North East Coast can, therefore, only be described as fairly good.   The same description applies to the trade in the Midlands, where makers are fairly well occupied for small sizes of angles, but where specifications for heavier sections and for plates are scarce.&quot;In Scotland the, slight falling off in production continues and mills have depended more or less on orders obtained from day to day to maintain their level of output. Order Books are in a depletod state and prospects are none too good.    Both the home and export trades are feeling the effects of the present inactive spell and many mills have beon compelled to adopt the policy of a shorter working week in order to enable plant to be operated with the least practicable loss.    It is hoped that this is only a temporary expedient.   Orders for ordinary as well as for special materials are increasingly difficult to obtain and while shipbuilding yards on the Clyde are fairly active with work at present on hand new business is scarce and the consumption of steel is steadily declining.    Raw materials are still dear, although the position with regard to scran has eased somewhat so far as supplies are concerned, at least temporarily; there has been no movement in the prices of saleable products.    A Scottish member puts forward as a possible explanation of the present falling off of demand the high bank rate since expenditure on iron and steel is essentially of a capital nature and new commitments are not so readily entered upon in a period of high money rates.wIn South Wales tinplates are holding their own, manufacturers are well supplied with orders to 85% of capacity and business Is steady.    Galvanised and black sheets continue to be in poor demand - the condition of the sheet trade Is re-acting upon the normal demand for steel.    But
CONFIDENTIAL.IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.)apart from this, stoel makers in South Wales are suffering from severe competition in steel bars from the Continent. The Continent has offered shoet bars at prices as low as 91/- f.o.b. Antwerp, tho equivalent of about  5.2.0d. delivered buyers works in South Wales.    Heavy purchases have been made by both tinplate and. sheet makers - and several steel works in South Wales are closing down.&quot;MR. MITCHELL reported that the steel trade in Scotland was not active and 3ome time had been lost at many of the mills.   The scrap position was easier and there had bean a slight reduction in price.    In September the imports of scrap into Sootland were larger than tho exports, which was an unusual experience. There had been a considerable import of foundry pig iron from the Continent.   One remarkable feature was the quantity of Indian basic pig iron v/hich had been   .on offer.Generally speaking, it might be said that there was not much confidence about the future.    Costs wore high relative to prices and there seemed littlo hope of getting any advance owing to the weaker position in Gormany.   The imports of Continental steel oontinued heavy and the prices easy.   The tube trade was fairly well employed on the whole;    there had been some shortage of work two weeks ago, but matters were better now, although there was not a vary active demand.MR. GUPTA referred to Mr. Mitchell&apos;s report as to the rise in the import of Indian pig iron and stated that he wished to correct an impression which had   got abroad, particularly on the Continent, that the low prices at which Indian pig iron was sold in Europe was due to subsidies or bounties from tho Indian Government.    That was absolutely incorrect.    In September, in the &quot;Times Trade Supplement&quot;, there was an article from the Hamburg Correspondent of the Times in which it was stated that German and Italian pig iron interests were about to petition their respective Governments on this matter, alleging that Indian pig iron was being sold in Italy and Germany at prices with which it would be impossible to compete, owing to its being subsidised by the Government of India.    It was true that up to March 1927, the Indian Government had paid certain subsidies, not on pig iron but on certain steel products, but all the bounties and subsidies ceased as from 31st March 1927, and since that date no bounty or subsidy had been paid by the Government on any article manufactured or produced in India.   He was anxious that that fact should be known in this country too.Mr. MITCHELL replied that he understood that the imports of Indian pig iron depended very much on the freight. Cheap freights led to large exports, and deliveries were somewhat uncertain in consequence.
1 7Ri t oNON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTELTON sent the following report:-COPPER: Reports from the principal centres In the United Kingdom indicate that business is at best on slightly below the average scale and that, owing to the uncertainty in world markets, consumers are very reluctant to cover thera-selves against other than orders already received.    It would appear, however, that there is less falling off in electrical business in this country than is the case on the Continent,TIN: With regard to the tinplate Industry, there Is nothing to add to the report given last month, and indications are that sales over 1929 will be on the whole satisfactory.SPELTER: Galvanisers continue to report that fresh orders are slow and that demand from India has not yet materialised.    Prices are low, and works in the Swansea area are undoubtedly holding considerable stocks of sheets.    In the Liverpool area there is also room for improvement, and September exports of galvanised sheets showed a falling off of 10,000 tons as compared with the corresponding month last year.    On the other hand there Is a fairly satisfactory home business, especially in black sheets.LEAD:    As in copper, consumers adopt a conservative attitude and are unwilling to take on heavy commitments. Demand, therefore, continues to be mainly for spot, and is spasmodic.    On the whole, however, it would appear that the heavier trades, such as cables, are.working on a good average scale, and that the smaller users, especially in the Birmingham district, are doing rather above the normal for the time of year:   we believe this to be mainly due to some improvement in the building trade.ENGINEERING.SIR ERNEST BETTER sent in the following report: -Activity in the coalmining and the Iron and steel Industries was well maintained in September as compared with preceding months, and there was a slight improvement In the employment situation in these industries, but there is reason to believe that there was a slight setback in the engineering trades.    This is confirmed by the latest unemployment statistics which shew that while the aggregate volume of employment in all industries remained virtually stationary in September as compared with August, the unemployment index for engineering industry went up from 9.2;  to 9.5$, there being an increase recorded in all sections with the exception of constructional engineering, where the percentage fell from 11.1 to 10.6.Unfortunately it has to be recorded that September, in succession to August, was again a disappointing month in foreign trade, particularly on the side of exports.   Both iron and steel and machinery export tonnages were considerably less than
1 7 0EjjO INEERING. (C ONTD).in August, and this year1 s total to date for machinery has fallen still further behind that of last year, 416,441 tons as against 426,243 tons.    The average value per ton, however, has risen from  94.2 to  96.1.With regard to the foreign trade In engineering and allied metal products for the first nine months of the year, the declared value of the combined exports has steadily risen until in 1929 it is 15.9$ above that of the corresponding period of 1924, but the volume of trade, owing to the fall in prices, is actually 34.4$ above that period.   Very largely this expansion is due to increased exports of new ships and of machinery in the last two years.    On the other hand, the combined imports for all the categories embraced stand in 1929 at 22.4,^ above 1924 in declared value, but in comparable volume they are 38.8$ In excess, due principally to the increase in the imports of non-ferrous metals, machinery and electrical goods.iviR. RICHMOND thought the marine engineering position could not be regarded as showing much improvement.   Unemployment in September still continued bad at 10.2;?, which, however, was distinctly better than in September 1928, when it was 14,5$. There was quite a substantial amount of work in hand, and on the Clyde at the end of September there were under construction 121 vessels of 579,335 tons, which was about 1Q$ over the number in hand in September, 1928.    The Clyde output for October consisted of 20 ships, and the total output for the ten months of the year showed a good average, though for the twelve months it was likely to be somewhat below last year.   A fair number of new vessels had been placed, and the shops should at least maintain the present level of employment during the winter and early spring.On the North East Coast there was still a considerable volume of work in hand, and the vessels under construction represented a substantial increase of 71;v in number over those at the same time last year.   A number of new contracts had recently been secured, and there were fair prospects of further contracts being placed at an early date.    Oil tankers were in demand again, and the North East Coast had been fortunate In obtaining a large share of this work, much of it for Scandinavian owners.    In this class of production we were making good progress, and at the present time we were constructing about 56,. of the world1 s output, whereas three years ago, when the Germans v/ere doing particularly well In this section, our percentage was only 35,^.In Belfast, in spite of the failure to secure a settlement of the joiners&apos;  strike, work was proceeding on a large number of contracts, and these had been augmented lately by an order for six vessels with steam reciprocating engines for the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique.    In this connection it was encouraging to note that the tonnage for foreign ovmers was greater than for some time past;    it
ENGINEERING  (CONTD. )constituted nearly 15% of the work under construction in this country.    In number and horsepower of engines under con-structlon at the end of September, Great Britain led with 330 of JL,03Q,035 horsepower, Denmark came next with 38 of 184,050 horsepower, and then Germany with 86 of 145,820 horsepower. The German figures, however, were not comparable with the others, as they did not include turbines.As regards the progress of the internal combustion engine abroad, there were 203 motor ships and 180 steamers under construction, but in Great Britain and Northern Ireland there were 101 motor ships and 231 steamers, so the position was practically reversed.    The Internal combustion engine was, however, making steady progress, especially In its application to large vessels, and there was increasing interest in the double-acting two-stroke type of engine for marine work.With regard to general engineering in Scotland, this continued to show a slight improvement, with a decline, however, in the motor vehicle work.    The most prosperous district was Motherwell, which had received some good contracts for structural steel and light plate work for the chemical and oil industries.    The machine tool trade was quite busy in certain districts, and encouraging reports came from several firms.MR. BROWHLIE said that, so far as his own organisation was concerned, there had been practically no change in the employment position in the last two months.    Of their 220,000 members 5.7 per cent, were unemployed.He had just returned from a visit of about eight weeks&apos; duration to the United States, where he had attended the Convention of the American Federation of Labour, held at Toronto.    The metal trades represented at that Convention were much concerned about the Installation of American plants In Europe for the manufacture of automobiles and equipment and were urging that means should be devised to prevent American corporations from installing plants abroad.   He had made considerable enquiries as to the extent of unemploy-ment in the United States.    One got all manner of figures ranging from 4 millions to 7 millions as being the number of people out of employment.    There was no system there of obtaining statistical returns regarding unemployment, but the people who were in a position to express an opinion said that there was more unemployment in the United States than was generally admitted.One matter which did not directly concern the Council, but was of interest, in that it concerned the whole American Trade Union movement and occupied a considerable part of the Convention&apos;s proceedings, was the system used by employers to suppress industrial disputes by applying to the Courts for injunctions.   Great hardship was caused to genuine trade unionists by this system and the Convention was considering means of testing its legality.Another question which was being considered by American trade unionists was what was known as the &quot;Yellow Dog&quot; contract.    This form of contract, he understood, dated back to the period immediately following the American Civil War. Under it a workman had to enter into a contract to remain
-4 Q AluiENGINEERING (CONTD.)in the employment of hie employer for a period of 12 months and &quot;during that period the employer deducted 10^ of his wages.    Should he leave before the expiration of the 12 months he lost a considerable amount.    The number of- these &quot;Yellow Dogw contracts could not be stated with accuracy, but It was believed that there were 1^- million in existence in tile various parts of the United States.The real wages of work people in the United States were not far in advanoe of those in this country.    Owing to the high cost of living the margin between expenditure and wages was not any higher than the margin in this country so far as skilled workmen were concerned.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said that he had no doubt that the state of industrial relations Mr. Brownlie had described existed in oertain parts of America, but it did not give a complete picture of American industry as he knew it, and certainly did not apply to the industry with which hewas connected.MOTOR INDUSTRY. SIR CYRIL HURCOMB wrote&quot;The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles) newly registered in August, 1929, was 1,048 more than in the corresponding period of 1928.    Goods vehicles increased by 1,257, but cars taxed on horse power and. hackney vehicles decreased by 111 and 95 respectively.&quot;As regards motor cycles, the number newly registered in August, 1929, was 1S9 less than in August 1928, and 940    --less than in the corresponding period of 1927&quot;.COTTON.SIR KENNETH STEWART said there were a good many markets making offers for cotton goods in October and a certain amount -of business was put through, but the quantities were rather small.    The most marked features that had affected the trade during the month had been the very low price to which silver had now fallen, and which had affected China very much. Business with India had been affected by dumping from Japan brought about by the falling off of Japan&apos;s best market, China. Chinese business had gone very   badly indeed and the Japanese had been getting rid of their stocks almost anywhere and at &quot;almost any price.    The Joint Committee of the Cotton Trade Organisations had just formed a company for the purpose of meeting the type of competition that we had with Japan.   The Company was not in itself a marketing company, but had been formed to co-ordinate the efforts of the various people who were trying to work out marketing organisations for specific
1 Q *dI O (0OOTTCH.   (CONTD  ).goods.      It would form a useful unit and would be able both to encourage these various marketing efforts and to take care that they were being directed along the right lines.The Manchester Chamber of Commerce had sent a representative to Canada to appear before the Canadian Tariff Board which was meeting this month to deal with the Canadian preference regulations.     The real trouble in that matter was not that there was a particularly large amount of goods definitely ruled out of the preferential duty by the present regulations, but that with the rise and fall in the price of cotton it was almost impossible to calculate whether goods which were near the border line really contained half their value of cotton from America.    He therefore sincerely hoped that the efforts of Mr. Thomas, followed up by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce representative, would be successful.MR. H. W. LEE wrote:-&quot;There is not only no improvement in trade since our last meeting, but, all round, I find it to be quieter and more difficult, and this may be taken as applying to the Home Trade and to the Export Trade, both in the coarse and in the fine classes of goods.      In the fine classes, with which I am more Intimately connected, the trade Is lamentably quiet.    The Spinning Mills are mainly endeavouring to run full time, but I am perfectly certain that they are not able to dispose of their product, and that a considerable amount of stock must be accumulated.      In the leaving Section, which runs more or less to order, I do not suppose that great stocks are being formed, but there are, without doubt, a considerable number of looms standing.This slackness is not only affecting producers in this country but In many countries in Europe.     Spinners and  , 7vreavers in Germany are nearly all on short time, and in countries like Switzerland, Italy, Czecho-Slovakia, etc, my reports are that they are all running shorter4 time than formerly, and all finding the utmost difficulty in trade.      I can give no idea as to how long this is likely to continue.    There have been a series of events all of which no doubt have contributed to the present position.     The gambling in New York, the very high Bank Rate, the possibilities of difficulties in the coal trade, the uncertainty about the silk duties and a general feeling of uncertainty as to future events, which appears to be at the back of the mind of almost everyone is no doubt having a great effect on trade at the moment.     Then the continuous fall in the price of cotton Is undoubtedly a great factor in stopping trade. Traders have been so hit in past years with losses from this cause that whenever we get a fall In cotton they are terrified of ordering anything in advance, and this alone Is sufficient to account for a considerable portion of the slackness.I cannot give any reasoned forecast as to the future. The Bank Rate has been reduced \% which is to the good.    The price of cotton to-day looks reasonable, and there is no doubt that if this steadies down and values begin to stiffen up it n would make a tremendous difference in the trade going through.
1 Q 9WOOL.MR. HAMILTON wrote;-&quot;The condition of the Industry as revealod by its activity is bad, with a total activity of 73-192.    In normal pre-war times about 93% or 94% would be considered full activity so that the Industry is approximately now about 20% depressed.   This activity is just about what it was twelve months ago, but, in the meantime, maohinery has boon destroyed and operatives have l^ft the Industry, so that activity in the Industry has really dwindled.   An illustration of this is in the figures of insured persons, which shew that of the total number between the ages of 16 and 64, the figure  now is 837,660 wheroas with the same ages twelve month ago the figure was 242,590.    In addition, there is a corresponding reduction in the number of insured persons above 65 years of age and a corresponding reduction in the number of young persons under 16 years of age.&quot;At this time of the year improvement (which is seasonal) should be rapid, particularly in the preparingfrocess and the earlier stages of the Industry, because if t is not so the looms are not demanding yarn.   The activity of every preparing process is less in October than in September this year which indicates that the activity Of the looms will be down compared with a year ago, and that the export of piece-goods will be down in December, January and February, because the Spinners have not got their yarns now and the looms do not require these yarns, which implies that the Orders for export are not coming in, or alternatively, that the prospects of the export trade are bad and they are not exporting, or that the prospects in the Hosiery trade arebad.   Yarn exports are increasing so that it is either the Hosiery trade which is bad, or the exports of piece-goods&apos; will be down in the usual export period quoted above.&quot;Summing up, if the orders for the Spring trade do not comewithln the next two or three weeks, it will be too late for this year and the prospects for tho Spring trade are very poor.&quot;HOSIERY.MR. WALKER observed that in Leicester, trade in the knitting industry was better, and the colder weather in October had oertainly given a fillip to trade, although even now unemployment figures showed that there was a considerable amount of unemployments   The figures were worse than a year ago probably due to the importation of goods from abroad. Although underwear and outerwear manufacturers were reporting better conditions, manufacturers of hose, especially in the artificial silk section, were far from busy.    The export trade generally was poor and below the average. Loughborough reported a slight improvement compared with a month ago, but a definitely worse position than twelve months ago.     Short time was still being worked in underwear,
CfNFIDENTIAL. HOSIERY (OONTD.).though hose showed some slight improvement.    In the Mansfield district the fashioned trade generally In the district was very good, but the seamless trade was still very slack, particularly in the finer gauges in both pure silk and artificial silk,Mr. Walker wished to confirm what Mr. Mitohell had said with regard to the effect of the uncertainty as to the policy of the Government in the matter of the silk duties. In the hosiery trade they viewed the possibility of the termination of the silk duties with very considerable apprehension, and they urged that the Government, before taking those duties off, should really make an enquiry as to how they had affected the trade.   As far as the hosiery trade was concerned, he had no hesitation in saying that they had had a most benefioial effect.   They had helped employment tremendously; machinery which had been half standing had come fully Into employment and a large amount of new machinery had been introduced.    If those duties were taken off, there would be heavy imports from Germany and other countries at prices with which we could not possibly compete.CHEMICALS.MR HILL wrote:-&quot;There is little of Interest to report in the chemica markets, the situation b^ng markedly deficient of any signs of improvement or otherwise.   The demand for chemicals for the textile, industries is none, too good,-but is not much below, normal.   There is---some improvement in the artificial silk industry; &quot;with a correspondingly better demand for wertain heavy chemicals and dyes.    In the latter market It I reported that the general demand for dyestuffs is good, and the appearance on the market of a number of new colours has provided an added Interests    Business generally in coal tar products has remained unchanged.&quot;Altogether, the autumn heavy chemical trade has not been up to the average, and there has been an absence of those signs which portend a better demand in the winter months.      Business in the fine chemical trade is normal&quot;.RUBBER.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said that in motor tyres, which represented the mainstay of the rubber industry in practically every country of the world, our home market was normal for the time of year.     The original equipment of motors, which was an important branch of the business, was a little uncertain.    Car manufacturers were in a state of uncertainty, and development of business was being held up. There was keener competition overseas than ever existed before in the rubber industry, but we wero showing an inarease in our exports about proportional to the increase in production.    He did not think it was at the expense of .
RUBBER (CONTD.).any other country, hut simply a share of the rising demand. An important factor bad been introduced by the financial collapse of the share market in America.   No one could aay ^jat present what effeot    it would have on the purchasing power of the public of the United States over the next 12 months, but it had had an immediate effect in stopping production in some industries - motor cars, radio and rubber - and there was an unfortunate circumstance in that the stock of tyres had never been so large as it was to-day. At the 31st August there were reported to be 14 million tyres in the hands of American manufacturersalone, and the last census showed that upwards of 2 million were in the hands of dealers.    If there were a sudden drop in the U.S. home demand - and there would be a drop, but to what extent no one could say at present - the effeot upon prices In competitive overseas markets would be very serious.The cycle tyre trade was keeping steady; there was an increase in exports and the home market was about the same. There was, however, a very substantial import; in the first 6 months of this year 732,000 were imported as against 1,173,000 for the whole of 1928 and 1,021,000 for the whole ; of 1927, and it looked as though the imports for the 12 &apos;. months of 1929 would exceed those for the 12 months of &apos; 1928.   The imports came chiefly from Belgium, Holland and Germany.It had been an admirable season for sports goods, and that section of the industry was fairly well oocupied for the time of year and was already beginning to make it-s plans for next season.     Mechanical rubbers was another important branch of the industry and was just normal.   There was fair employment at poor prices, and there would not be much improvement until the heavy industries showed a considerable expansion.   There had been a great increase in the imports of rubber boots and shoes, which was rather depressing that section of the trade.    During the first 6 months of this yoar 655,000 pairs were imported as against 769,000 for the whole of 1928, and 428,000 for the whole of 1927.   There, as a result of the seasonal character of the trade,the 1929 figure would be immensely greater than the 1928, because large imports of rubber boots take place in the second half of the year.The trade in surgical goods was on a small scalet but the British quality v/as supreme and we kept up a good export trade.    In the waterproof garment trade the rains came too late in the season to save the situation, and the year 1929 would be the worst year that this trade had had for a long time.   That was entirely due to seasonal causes and not to any change of fashion.The imports were chiefly from America, Czeoho Slovakia and Poland.The labour cost in Czecho Slovakia and in Poland was extremely low and prices were being out very fine.    In a faotory in Budapest, in which he was largely interested, the wages were 35$ of those in their factory in Liverpool. The Amerloans, on theother hand, had no wages advantage, but, by up-to-date machinery and sheer volume of trade, they had made a heavy attack on the British market.   They certainly produced a very fine product, and at one time their tennis shoe was the best on the market.
FINANCE.LORD BRADBURY said that, as he had not been able to attend the last meeting, his report would cover the conditions in the money market during both September and October.     There were no serious withdrawals of gold during the early part of September, but the exchanges were weak and the money market felt itself under the constant threat of a higher Bank Rate. On the 23rd September the outflow of gold in serious quantities started again and a rise in Bank Rate became practically a certainty.     On the 26th September the Bank Rate was at last raised to 6^, greatly to the relief of the market, which had been living In embarrassing uncertainty for many weeks.     The Bank had seen its gold reserve sink from  164,000,000 on the 12th June to  132,000,000 on the 25th September - a net loss of  32,000,000 - before feeling driven to raise the Bank Rate. The situation leading to the rise in the Bank Rate was obsoured to some extent at the last moment by the sensational Hatry collapse and by considerable falls in speculative securities on the London Stock Exchange, but this was merely a coincidence and there was of course no reason to associate these events with the rise in the Bank Rate,     The first results of the higher Bank Rate were not altogether encouraging, because the French exchange showed no immediate 3igns of Its effect and gold continued for a considerable time to go to France.     The New York and Berlin rates, however, quickly rose above the Gold Point and no more gold was lost in those directions.During October there occurred an event of the greatest importance.     The investment boom, that had continued -apparently without any finality - upon the New York Stock Exchange for two or three years, suddenly came to an end and was succeeded by a phenomenal slump in security values.     It was soon apparent that the disproportionate attraction which New York was offering to money from all parts of the world had come to an end, for the time being at ljast, and funds returned from New York to Europe in large quantities.     The effect was to put the sterling New York Exchange well above parity and to make it at last more probable that gold would flow from America to Europe than in the opposite direction.On the 31st October the Bank of England were able to reduce their rate to Q%,      In fact the gold reserve at the Bank of England was not any higher - it was actually a little lower -than it was when the Bank Rate was raised to 6-%%, but the exohange position had of course been entirely altered by the slump in Amerloa and the Bank of England appeared anxious to restore a lower Bank Rate as soon as possible.     There was a constant drain of gold to Paris during Ootober and the early part of November, no doubt the result of large withdrawals of French funds from New York via London, and this roughly counterbalances the gold that was being attracted to London by the higher Bank Rate from other parts of the world.     The French Exchange position could not yet be called very secure, because it was only a shade, at 123.87, above the gold&quot;export point.     The New York rate at 4,87f was well above par.Gilt edged markets, which were reviving with the fall In the Bank Rate, were dull owing to the new conversion loan and speculative business on the London Stook Exchange was practically at a standstill.     The Bill market was dealing In
CONFIDENTIAL. FINANCE  (CONTD).three months&apos; bills at something below 5.11/16$ and was finding it hard to maintain a firm bill rate, because of heavy buying from, the Continent - evidence presumably that foreign money was coming to London, or at least that foreign balances were being steadily maintained here.Mr. QILLETT asked Lord Bradbury if he had any views as to the reasons for the French withdrawal of gold and whether he thought there was any political reason for it,LORD BRADBURY replied that he did not think there was any political reason in the latter stage.     There, might have been in the earlier stage, just before the Hague Conference, but he thought there were a number of economic reasons for it just about the time of the rise in the Bank Rate,     The withdrawals were very largely the result of what one might call the flight back to the franc.     Frenchmen had been putting their money abroad. Since the conditions had started to improve that money had been ooming back.     There had been an exceptional d ,mand for francs and that was bound to influence its value for the time being. Unless bank credit was extended in France to a degree which would be dangerous to the internal circulation, the only way of getting those franca   was by the import of gold into France and the issue of franc notes against the gold imported,GENERAL TRADE,Association of Chambers of Commerce Reports.MR. MITCHELL reported that in Liverpool the ship-repairing firms had generally experienced a falling-off in trade during the past month.     As regards wool, auctions of East Indian wool were held from the 22nd to 25th October, when 17,000 bales were offered and 13,000 bales sold.     The Home trade took 6,000, America 5,000 and the Continent 2,000 bales.     There was little change in price.     The month of October in the tanning and leather trade opened rather better than it had closed, as although the London Shoe and Leather Fair went off fairly well, there was still a want of confidence on the part of buyers who only operated for immediate requirements.     Tanners were keeping fairly firm prices as owing to the reduced input of hides their stocks were on the light side.Conditions in the imported meat trade had been suffering a seasonal dulness, brought about by the influx of home-killed beef, mutton and lamb.     The bacon trade was steady and prices in the cheese market had been firm.The autumn season in the Nottingham laoe trade was proceeding much on the lines expected.     The better quality goods for the more expensive drosses were selling moderately well and the cheaper quality flouncings were being extensively bought. Novelties in all descriptions of laces were being produced for the spring season and it was anticipated that lace would be used to an even greater extent than during the last season for trimming purposes, so that, with the advent of Spring, a bigger
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD).Association of Chambers of commerce Reports (Contd).volume of machinery should he employed. As regards curtains, the turnover showed a slight Improvement over last year. While fancy goods remained in favour there was a noticeable tendency to revert to the &quot;Nottingham Lace Curtain&quot; sold In pairs. As regards ladies&apos; and children&apos;s light clothing, the experience of different firms varied, but It was difficult to find anyone who was satisfied with the present state of affairs, and many factories were working short time.In the hosiery trade, the winter season for underwear had opened quite well, but an enormous quantity of foreign made under-wear was now on the market and adversely affecting the sales of the home made article.     Spring orders for underwear, hose and half-hose were now being placed and were quite up to the average. Export trade was fairly good with South Africa and New Zealand, and there was a slight improvement in the demand from Australia for better olass goods.     The United States of America. Canada and Scandinavia were taking normal quantities of fancy Cashmere footwear.The hosiery trade was anxiously awaiting developments in the worsted spinning Industry.     A prolonged stoppage would have a most detrimental effect on the trade generally and probably drive manufacturers to seek supplies of yarn on the Continent.     The uncertainty as to the policy in regard to the duties on silk and artificial silk was already having a detrimental effect, and it was feared that operations In these materials would be largely suspended after Christmas unless some re-assuring Official statement was made in the near future.Federation of British Industries Reports.MR, LENNOX LEE sent the following reports on behalf of the Federation of British Industries:-COAL:- The September activity has been maintained and there has been some Increase during the month in the export trade. In South Wales the demand for anthracite is reported to be good but the position of the steam ooal trade in that area is disappointing.      In Lancashire the home coal position has Improved but interest In regard to industrial ooal appears to be mainly centered In forward business. The Scotch coal market continues firm, the demand for special types of fuel showing a marked improvement,*IRON AND STEEL:- Business shows no expansion on that of the previous month and conditions have become quieter of late. In the pig iron section conditions continue firm and forward prices are slightly above existing levels.     In the semi-finished products department the lack of orders is commencing to have a serious effect, two firms having announced their intention to close down,     The downward movement of Continental semi-finished products Is causing general unsettlement of prices and until this is checked no Improvement is anticipated.     The tinplate market has been less aotive but recent new orders in the shipbuilding yards are expected to stimulate business in this section.
GENSRAL TRAPS (CONTD), Federation of British Industries Reports   (Contd).ENGINEERING &amp; SHIPBUILDING:-   Conditions have been quiet but a number of substantial contracts placed during October should stimulate activity in the near future.     In the structural engineering section manufacturers are reported to be relying on the new construction work under the Government Unemployment Scheme to maintain the present level  of business.     In the shipbuilding trade the completion of contracts caused some falling off In the activity during the month,HARDWARE &amp; CUTLERY:.   As a result of seasonal ordersconditions have substantially improved, although In the agricultural tool department trade has been quieter.COTTON:-   Spinning &amp; Weaving.   During the month Sakellardis have dropped id, and Uppers about id, per lb.     Futures have also lost ground to the extent of about -Id. per lb. The instability of the international monetary situation has aocentuated the tendency for buyers to hold off and to limit their commitments as much as possible.     There is an increasing fear that cotton prices may reach still lower levels.     In consequence of this yarn and cloth buyers have held off during the month and It is officially stated that some 5,500,000   spindles, controlled by members of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners, have been stopped indefinitely.     In the weaving section business has been &quot;very quiet except in a few specialised lines.     New business for India has been small and China has continued lifeless. Some business in narrow shirtings has been done with Egypt for delivery before the new tariff becomes operative. A fair amount of business has also been- done with the Colonies.&quot;Bleaching. Conditions during the month show an improvement over those of the preceding month, largely in consequence of the cotton stoppage.     Receipts and deliveries of cloth were better and stocks of cloth in Bleachers&apos; hands show an increase, although in all cases the figures are still below the level obtaining prior to July last.     Bookings for India have been on a lower scale than for the last year or two and trade with China has almost ceased.Dyeing.   The month1 s output in dyed piece goods is reported to have been disappointing although there was an improvement towards the end of the month.Printing.   Returns covoring a considerable portion of the calico printing industry show that during October plants were busier than during September.     There is, however, much leeway to make up to reach the standard of the earlier months of this year,     India is reported to be taking slightly more printed goods although Japanese competition is very severe.     Bookings for Egypt have been slightly better whilst the prospects from the Argentine for the noxt few months are said to be fairly good,      in Brazil and. Colombia monetary stringency has seriously affected business.&quot;
ISOGENERAL TRADE (OONTD.).Federation of British Industrious Reports (Contd.). jtWOOLLEN AND WORSTED:-   Business was slightly restricted towards the end of October owing to the uncertainty of the threatened strike and trade during the month was generally poor.   Manufacturers catering for the coating trade, however, are reported to be fully booked for the next few weeks.BOOTS AND SHOES:-     The seasonal demand has caused a slight improvement and the majority of the factories in the Northampton area are reported to be well booked up.   The export business has been maintained during October.Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR. HAYHURST wrote to the following effect:-Sales pursued their normal course during October, and it is gratifying to again report satisfactory increases over the corresponding period of last year.   This increase represents a value of almost  400,000 sterling.   The production of goods in our various factories - grocery, provisions, drapery, clothing, boots etc. - also shew satisfactory inoreases, the total value of their output being  200,000 sterling increase over last year*s corresponding period.     In the banking section, considerable increasos are recorded, 400 new accounts having been opened within the past few weeks.   During the past 13 weeks the &quot;value of our export sales has been in the neighbourhood   of  400,000 sterling.Butter. Danish prices during the past two weeks have ruled practically unchanged, and with the Continental enquiry being rather less than usual, a weakening of the market seemed imminent.   At the end of the month our own people reduced their prices 6d. per cwt.    At the time of reporting, a steady demand continues, but unless the demand increases from the Continent, reductions will have to be made to regain confidence.Cheese.     A substantial quantity of &quot;Held&quot; Cheese has recently been released, which puts supplies temporarily in excess of demand.   At the end of the month the market was reported steady, prices being maintained.    Increased demand at the close of the month for Lancashire and Cheshire make caused prices to advance very smartly.Sugar.   A reduction  in price caused the markets to develop weakness, with the result that all refiners and beet faotories were compelled to further reduce their figures, and, at the time of reporting, dull conditions are the order.    Large quantities have been moved by us into consumption.Wheat.   The last report to me indicated much lower markets in Liverpool Chicago, Winnipeg and the Argentine.   It is said that U.S.A. speculators are beginning to realise that importing countries are able to resist their efforts to maintain prices,
1 G ^-li.GENERAL TRADE (OONTD.)Co-operative Wholesale Society fpontd.).and^-that requirements in Europe are nothing like&apos;  as large as they have been in the last two or three seasons.   High prices asked for Canadian caused millers to use less of that particular quality, with the result that supplies have remained in Canada.   The flour market remains quiet.    I hoar that there is not much enthusiasm amongst either buyers or producers in pushing National   Mark,    flour, and it would appear from present indications that It will not develop into an important factor in the flour trade.Tea.   The tea market was somewhat Irregular during the early part of last month, but showed improvement after the first week.Coffee. Only moderate supplies of this commodity have been offered.   As usual at this time of year only very small lots were offered for auction, but of them good quality lots realised full prices whilst the lower grades were slow of sale.   The new crop of British East African (Kenya) coffee has been coming to hand, but is disappointing in character and rather unattractive.    Prices ruled generally in favour of buyers, but a fow parcels of quality met with a steady demand.Cocoa,   The market has not been at all brisk, and little business&apos; has been done to date.   Buyers are holding off in anticipation of lower prices.   The price of raw cocoa being at a comparatively low figure, there is a possibility of speculators being caught should the market assume an upward tendency, which is thought to be not entirely impossible. Probably business will become more active shortly.Retail Distributive Trade. SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE wrote:-&quot;Reviewing trade experience in October in the retail distributive trades, as refleoted in the figures now to hand from Departmental Stores throughout the country, the principal ground for satisfaction is that most firms were able to approximate to the turnover done during the corresponding month of last year, and that the long series of decreases, due to the exceptional weather during September, were not repeated last month.   Variations in turnover were in nearly all cases of comparatively small dimensions, showing that most Stores were only just able to maintain their figures, and could not make up for the ground lost in September.&quot;The break in the weather at the beginning of Ootober led to a welcome increase in business, which encouraged the hope that the Autumn trade proper was at last commencing. These hopes were disappointed when sales fell away,-19-1 -&quot;&quot;&quot;--IT---------
GENERAL TRADE (OONTD.).Retail Distributive Trade (Contd.).jtpossibly owing to the milder weather, in the middle of the month, but there waa again an improvement during the last ten days or fortnight of the month when such merchandise as warm underclothing, coats, knitted outerwear, gloves, etc., began to move freely into consumption.&apos;   This improvement has continued into November, but colder woather would be welcomed in order to stimulate demand for winter merchandise proper.   As stated, variations in turnover as compared with October 1928, are generally not very pronounced, and in consequence it is diffioult to detect any decided tendencies.    One Store may just have been able to improve on their last year*s figures, while another fell short by a similar peroentage, ani differences generally are not cuch to warrant any decided conclusion being drawn.    In general, most Stores have been    glad   to   equal their last year&apos;s turnover, and few are in a position to congratulate themselves on an improvement.&quot;An encouraging feature is the increases in staff, in some eases of substantial dimensions, which are reported from almost all parts of the country&quot;.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIPPING.MR ALEXANDER SHAW reported that the index number for shipping freights for the last quarter was less than it was twelve months ago and the usual seasonal upward movement was not so marked.   The    index number for the last quarter, as compared with 100 in 1920, was 24.96, and as compared with 100 in 1913, It was 106.67.    In the corresponding quarter in 1928 the index was 25.8 as compared with 100 in 1920, and 110.26 as compared with 100 in 1913, so that the shipping freights still remain at a level which is unremunerative on the whole.   The tonnage laid up at the principal ports, however, had fallen considerably; on October 1st, 1989, at British ports, British and foreign tonnage laid up was 265,997 tons net, as compared with 415,399 tons on October 1st, 1928.An interesting point about the figure of tonnage under construction in the quarter ending 30th September, was that the United Kingdom still maintained the lead which It gained about twelve months ago.    Out of a total tonnage under construction of 2,817,000 tons, the United Kingdom had 1,448,000 tons, as against 1,368,000 tons in all other countries put together.    Unfortunately the tonnage commenced in the last quarter had fallen as compared with -the same quarter in 1988.    In the 1928 quarter the tonnage commenced in Great Britain and Ireland was 431,000 tons, in the 1929 quarter it was 360,000 tons, but still it exceeded by some 60,000 tons the tonnage commenced in all other countries in the world put together.fE report by Mr. Shaw on the use of pulverised ooal in ships is reproduced in the section on Coal/.

HILTON, reported that since the end of September there had been a net increase in the number of unemployed on the registers of just over 70,000.   Apart from a slight drop on 21st October, the figures had shown each week a continuation of the usual seasonal increase that first showed itself, this year, on 23rd September.   All divisions show an increase over the month.     The Midlands Division had felt It least;    the North Eastern had shown only a moderate increase - about 6,000 - as compared with the heavy increase of the previous month. All the other divisions had increases ranging from 7,000 to 12,000, and these increases had been fairly evenly spread.The growth in the numbers on the register since the low water mark at the beginning of June last had been about 150,000.
EMPLOYMENT  (CONTD).150,000.     That was, In great part, seasonal, there being always a tendency for unemployment to Increase during the second half of the year, until a few weeks before Christmas. The dose of the holiday season released large numbers of hotel, boarding house and other workers from holiday resorts, and it also brought a decline in road, rail and shipping transport.      In the distributive trades there was a similar falling off, and in entertainments and sports services.     The approach of bad weather brought a slackening in the building trade, particularly in the decorating section, and in brick and tile making and other forms of outdoor work.     That slackness had been deferred a little longer this year, because of the continuation of the summer weather, but, when it did come, its effect was the more marked.     There was also the seasonal work in preserve factories during the fruit season and in certain other food industries which came to an end In the autumn.     In the motor vehicle industry there was always a period of slackness in August, September and October, until the new orders were received as a result of the Olympla Show,     There was very little doubt that these influences accounted in the main for the increase of 150,000 in the live registers since the beginning of June, and it might be expected that during the next few weeks there would be a further increase in the register figures of about 30,000 or 40,000 due largely to the restriction of out-door work.Apart from these seasonal influences and the possibility of stoppages in the wool Industry or the shlp-bullding Industry, it did not seem likely that there would be any serious general decline in employment, but on the other hand he saw no immediate prospect of a substantial improvement.      Judging from past experience, Christmas trade and traffic would lead to an Improvement during December, which would probably be followed by a decline when the temporary Christmas trade came to an end, and&apos;then we should experience the customary January improvements.Mr. Phillips had given last month 36,000 as the probable reduction over last year In the number of persons counted as belonging to the coal mining industry.     That had been only an estimate and it had now been found that in the year from the 1st July, 1928, to 1st July,  1929, there had, In fact been a reduction of 41,000 persons recorded as belonging to the coal mining industry.     That meant that what might be called the surplus worked off In the coal mining industry in the last three years was over 116,000 persons.As regards the number of insured persons in employment (see table below) the August figure was 10,274,000, the September figure 10,278,000, and the figure for October 21st, 10,229,000.     That showed a drop of nearly 50,000 in the number In employment, which represented the margin by which the increase in unemployment in the period had exceeded the annual increase in the numbers entering into insurance.MR. TURNER asked if miners, who ware still miners but who, after two or three ysars&apos; unemployment, had exhausted their unemployment pay would still be counted as miners.
- CONFIDENTIAL.EMPLOYMENT (CONTD.) .MR. HILTON thought they would generally keep alive their insurance, but if they went out of insurance altogether and lost touch altogether with the labour exchange, then after about 12 or 18 months of their losing touch, they would drop out of the register.     He did not think, however, there were a great number in that position.Monthly Statistics of insured persons aged 16 to 64 in employment.Date.1.Estimated numbers insured.2.Numbers un-employed.Difference between cols,2 &amp; 3 (to near-est hundred)3.4.Estimated number inemployment after deduoting from col,4. 3i per cent, of the numbers in col,2. to allow for sickness-&quot;-and other unrecorded non-employment, ex-elusive of temporary holidays,Including persons directly involved in trade disputes. 5.Excluding per-sons directly invoIved in trade disputes, 6.1928,October. .

AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON observed that, as a consequence of the great reduction in the value of wool, considerable financial stringency existed In Australia today and every effect was being made to  adjust the present conditions to the necessity for economy &quot;in every direction.     There had been received into store since 1st April up to 30th September last 926,000 bales of wool, of which 193,000 had been sold, and there had been shipped for sale overseas 3,000 bales.     This showed a very heavy amount of wool held for realisation later,     The October sales had shown an improved demand and a better price, attracting competition from Yorkshire, Japan, Europe and the Australian mills.     Wool growers and wool brokers had decided to continue to reduce offerings by 33%^to the end of December and to spread the balance of the clip as evenly as possible up to 30th June instead of April as previously.The exports of wheat this season had been 80,000,000 bushels as compared with 49,000,000 in the corresponding period of last season.     Exports of flour had been 492,000 tons as compared with 401,000 tons last season.The revenue from Customs from July to October showed an increase of  if million over last year, although a comparison of October this year with October 1928 gave a decrease of  255,000.     The bank clearances in all State capitals from 1st January to 28th October were  1,945,497,000 as compared with  1,886,068,000 last year,A new Commonwealth loan of  10,000,000 for five years at 5i per cent,    at 98, had been opened for subscription in Australia.     Proceeds would be used for Commonwealth and State works and for paying off maturing State securities.     It had been reported in the Press, though he had no official confirmation of it, that the Loan Council had decided that for the time being conditions were not favourable for further loans.INDIAN TRADE.MR. GUPTA observed that the imports of private merchandise for September 1929 were 19 crores 22 lakhs, shewing a deorease as oorapared with 20 crores 71 lakhs for September 1928.     The exports were 26 crores 27 lakhs for September 1929, an increase as compared with 24 crores 84 lakhs for September 1928.     The balance of trade in favour of India for that month was 5 crores 74 lakhs, as compared with 3 crores 34 lakhs for September 1928.     The details for August 1929 showed that the imports of  articles wholly or mainly manufactured, amounting to 14 crores 48 lakhs, were less by 1 crore 07 lakhs than in August 1928, mainly due to smaller imports of cotton and woollen piece goods.     It was during the months of July and August that piece goods usually oame into India, and the fact that there had been a decrease was rather significant.     The exports in August 1929 of food, drink and tobacco at 6 crores 91 lakhs were greater by 61 lakhs than in August, 1928, due mainly to increases under grain, pulses, rice and tea.     Raw materials and produce fell by 2 lakhs to 11 crores 31 lakhs, due to decreases in the exports of raw jute, lao, raw hides and raw wool.     Articles wholly or mainly manufactured decreased by 4 lakhs to 8 crores 29 lakhs, due to smaller exports of tanned hide.
INDIAN TRADE  (CONTD).The Imperial Bank of India had raised Its rate of discount from 5% to 6% early in October, and again from 6% to 7% at the end of the month.     The wholesale price index-number for September, 1929, was 143, as compared with 142 for September of last year.     Rainfall had been moderate and seasonable over most parts of India, and the condition of standing crops, was, on the whole, fair to good.A question of interest had arisen out of a provision in the Indian Finance Bill of 1927 for the removal of the export duty of 5% ad valorem on raw hides.     Vttien the proposal was put to the vote In the Legislative Assembly, the division resulted in a tie, the President gave his vote in favour of the status quo and the removal of the duty was, therefore, negatived *     It appeared, however, to the Government of India that the voting in the Assembly had reflected a definite well-balanced conflict of interests, and they had therefore instituted a Committee of Inquiry &quot;to enquire Into and report on the articles on which a cess might suitably be imposed and the rate of cess on each article ,     The idea was that the export duty on hides should  -be removed and replaced by a cess, and the proceeds cf the cess should go towards research work to improve the quality of the Indian hides and skins.     This committee was now sitting,COLONIAL TRADE.MR, SEEL gave the following figures of trade in the various Colonies.Kenya and Uganda,     For the first 7 months of 1929, the value Of domestic exports from Kenya and Uganda was  4,854,000 as compared with  4,740,000 in the corresponding period of 1928,     In the same period the export of cotton from Uganda amounted to 621,000 centals as compared with 498,000 centals in 1928,     For the first-6 months of 1929, the value of the home consumption imports of Kenya and Uganda was  4,146,000, as compared with  3,771,000 In 1928,     The percentage of imports from the United Kingdom was 36% in 1929 as compared with 38% In 1928,Gold Coast,     The exports in 1928 were  13,825,000 as compared with  14,350,000 in 1927j   the imports were  12,200,000 in 1928 and  13,771,000 in 1927,   The export of raw cacao in 1928 amounted to 225,077 tons, a figure which has only once been exceeded, and it was significant that the value of the cfecao exported ( 11,230,000) represented 81% of the total value of the Gold Coast export trade in 1928, Germany&apos;s share in both the import and export trade of the Gold Coast was now greater than in 1913,     The United Kingdom had practically maintained its share of the Gold Coast export trade during the last 5 years, but its share of the Import trade had gradually decreased,Nigeria,     The Annual Report of the Nigerian Customs Department for the year 1928 had been received and showed the following figures for Imports and exports for the past three years.

The amount of rubber exported in September, 1929, was 53,000 tons, as compared with 50,000 tons In August, and 30,000 tons in September 1928.   For the first nine months of 1929 the gross exports were 434,000 tons, as compared with 249,000 tons for the corresponding period of 1928.     The output of tin and tin in ore from the Federated Malay States for the first nine months of 1929 amounted to 49,000 tons, as compared with 46,000 tons in the corresponding period of 1928.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR HOSE sent a report to the following effect:-Since the middle of September general rains have continued in the agricultural areas of Argentina, and prospects for the wheat harvest are greatly improved; a fair yield of wheat is now possible, althought it is estimated that the crop must still be some 25 per cent, less than last year.   A large proportion of the area sown to wheat and linseed, which had been abandoned by the farmers,  is now being sown to maize, so that it appears possible that the acreage under maize cultivation this season will constitute a record.COLONIAL TRADE (CONTD).Exports.

The breaking of the drought in Argentina has had a favourable effect upon the economic situation as a whole.     A feeling of optimism is more generally prevalent and prospects appear better for the Spring trade, while, in the markets for textile manufactures, the tone has been favourably affected by the improved agricultural prospects.     Orders from the camps are reported to be coming in well, and the collection of drafts is being made with Increased facility.     During the past month, the Argentine exchange declined at one time to 45id. per gold peso, at which level shipments of gold from Argentine to this country would be very profitable.  &quot; In this connection it appears that the Argentine Government has adopted a policy of discouraging the withdrawal of gold from the Conversion Office for export, especially when effected in connection with profit on exchange only and not for commercial requirements.     However, certain shipments of gold having recently been arranged, the value of the peso has recovered to 465/ q3(The general situation in Chile shows advancement;    trade in Santiago is active, especially in products of the national industries and in lines connected with building, while conditions are more favourable in the central and southern districts of the country, these tendencies having been assisted by Government expenditure on public works.     Heavier sales in practically all lines of business have been reported, while a well distributed rainfall has brought about favourable prospects In the agricultural areas.      Satisfactory conditions are  also reported from the manufacturing industries.     Although the current period of the year is normally a dull season for the nitrate Industry, production of the fertiliser is well maintained, under the assurance of continued Government assistance.The official returns of the Customs revenue of Chile for the first nine months of 1929 indicate that the revenue derived from the duties on imports into and e xports from the Republic was considerably higher than that In the corresponding period of 1928,     The greater trading activity this year Is also demonstrated by the provisional official figures of the foreign trade relating to the first half of 1929, which give the total value of imports, at 743,780,000 pesos, and that of exports at 1,297,130,000 pesos, showing a surplus of exports over Imports of 553,350,000 pesos.     For the first half of 1928, the corresponding total of imports was 533,400,000 pesos and that of exports 989,180,000 pesos, the surplus of exports being 455,780,000 pesos.     The principal items in the import trade during the first six months of 1929 comprised the textile group -   as Is normally the case - and represented a total value of 173,600,000 pesos, piece goods accounting for 97,600,000 pesos. Plant and material for the transportation services amounted to 92,500,000 pesos.     With regard to exports, nitrate and iodine totalled 539,800,000 pesos and metallic ores 542,500,000 pesos.In Brazil, the situation in regard to coffee remains difficult and obscure, owing to the heavy stocks known to exist in the Interior, and to the decline in prices of the commodity in the consuming markets.     It has,. In fact, been found necessary temporarily to suspend new business in coffee in the Santos market.      It would appear that, to enable the Brazilian authorities and the Coffee Institute to continue with their valorisation
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE  (OONTD).policy in regard to coffee, it will be necessary for additional funds to be obtained by the flotation of a loan;   negotiations for this purpose are understood to have taken place in London, but no official announcement in this connection Is as yet available.     The general trend of business has latterly again been^downward, putting an end to the indications of a slight improvement previously in evidence.     Money continues tight, in spite of the stagnant conditions of trade, and this Is a most disappointing factor, for it appears possible that, in the event of a definite improvement in the trade situation, there might prove to be insufficient oredit to finance the increased volume of business.The returns of Brazilian overseas trade for the first seven months of 1929 show that exports amounted in value to the equivalent of some  54,667,000 and imports to  52,275,000, showing a favourable trade balance of  2,392,000.     In the corresponding period of 1928, exports totalled  56,565,000 and Imports  49,652,000, the surplus of exports being  6,913,000.     Shipments of coffee in the period mentioned amounted to 7,840,000 bags, valued at  40,304,000 compared with 8,267,000 bags to the value of  40,863,^00 in 1928.     In view of the need for greater diversification of products In the Brazilian export trade, it is of Interest to observe that frozen meat is the only commodity in respect of which exports showed a marked increase, the total value of shipments being  2,115,150, against  1,460,075 in 1928.The trade movement in Peru continues restricted, and the general business situation is dull.     Mining production, however, continues at a high level and the output and exports of petroleum are normal.     The local market for raw cotton has latterly been very quiet;   some 60 per cent, of the crop has been shipped, and the camps are now being cleaned In preparation for new planting. Large sales of sugar have been made to Chile.     The construction of the new port works at Callao is proceeding and It is anticipated that the work will be finished in the early part of 1931,     Following upon its completion, a considerable reduction Is anticipated in the cost of handling cargo passing through the Port.In Colombia transport conditions are reasonably good, but navigation oh the River Magdalena has been upset by the almost complete absence of freight.     In regard to the commercial situation, there is a general disposition to defer new business for the time being.     Sales of merchandise are restricted, but a scarcity of oertain articles is becoming noticeable, and it appears reasonable to anticipate an improvement in the demand.In Venezuela, business in general is reviving slightly. The political situation is Improved, although some uncertainty still exists.     Merchants are for the most part conservative in their buying of staple commodities.     Commercial conditions in Ecuador do not show much Improvement and pessimism is expressed on account of the poor results attending the coooa harvest. Business In Salvador continues quiet, and in Nicaragua dull, with collections slow.
