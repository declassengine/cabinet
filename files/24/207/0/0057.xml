The First Commissioner of Works, the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster and the Under Secretary of State for Scotland have fully stated to us their case in regard to the conclusions reached by them as a result of the Sub-Committeers examination of the problem and. which are embodied in the Addendum on pages 19 to 27 inclusive of the Report,3. It will be remembered that the Sub-Committee&apos;sReport comprised five x^possible schemes of which SchemesNOTE.j?   Since the last meeting at which the Ministerial Membersof the Sub-Committee were present, a further note has been received from the Chancellor of the Duchy on the modifications introduced by the new Clause 4 to the Unemployment Insurance Bill.     We have not considered this on its merits but in any case our main conclusions are not affected by it.-1-
SUMMARY Os? ARGUMENTS SUBMITTED TCTHT C0KMITT22.5.(1)Before coming into Office the Party hadpledged itself to a scheme of retirement pensions as a means of relieving unemployment. The Government&apos;s unemployment policy is basedon national reconstruction and trade developmentbut to meet immediate needs various schemes of relief work and other emergency measures have been undertakeen.As regards nationalreconstruction,  it is to be e:cpected thatare Temporary Schemes and that recommendations were attachedonly to Schemes C and E.     We have made no detailed examination of the Permanent Scheme E as it appeared tous that any permanent Scheme of Retirement pensions would fall for consideration to the Cabinet Committeewhich has been set up to review the whole field ofNational Insurance and Pensions.     This Report istherefore, solely concerned with Temporary Scheme C,the particulars bf which are set out in paragraphs 59to 10c inclusive of the Sub-CommitteeTs Report.4. In their Addendum to the Report the first commissioner of Works and his Ministerial Colleagues gave their reasons for recommending acceptance of Scheme C and their answer to possible objections which might be raised to that Scheme.   During the discussions&quot; very full consideration was given to the main arguments advanced in favour of the adoption of Scheme C;    these arguments are summarised in the following paragraph.
 01-11 o:,Ti 02 AH&amp;IMBNTS the first effect will he some increase ofFitted to the..ittee. (Contd). unemployment and that no beneficial resultson the unemployment position will accrue until a considerable time has elapsed.    The proposedemergency measures will not employ more than50,000 persons at any one time.    TheGovernment are therefore open to the criticism that they have done little to relieve immediate unemployment and, in fact,no other Scheme has been devised whichwill produce such great results in thenext four or five years as Scheme C.(3)    The Hetirement Pensions Scheme would provide roughlywork for/280,000 unemployed workers.      Itwould substitute young workers for old andthese young persons would get permanentoccupation in normal industry and thus be in a position to use their skilledcapacity.      In so far as old workers arebeing retained today in industry on uneconomicgrounds, their removal would &quot;benefit industryand contribute towards re-organisation.(4)    The cost to pahlic funds under this Schemeof creating a vacancy is estimated at  50asper vacancy for the first year, where/the comparable net cost of placing&apos; a man at work on an une^employment   scheme is  200.     Further, the cost of the scheme to the Stfcte would be directly proportional to the results attained. (5)      It is most improbable that the combined effect of the scheme and of raising the school leaving age would be to reduce the unemployment pool below such a level as would create a shortage of labour in any circum--3-
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE JOIlvlITTES .  ( Contd . )    (6)stances which, can he foreseen..So far from imposing any additional burden on industry the scheme would strengthen industry economically;    as regards the burden of cost reference should be made to the considerations set out in paragraph 20 of the Ministerial Addendum. (7)    Criticism whether inside or outside Parlia-ment that the scheme would breed discontent because it differentiated between individuals in the same economic class, could be answered by pointing out that the scheme is founded on the sole principle that it is an emergency unemployment measure.    Any social reform can be shown to single out particular classes for preferential treatment.support of the adoption of Scheme &quot;C&quot; as an unem-ployment measure but after very careful consideration we have been forced also to recognise the weightopinion of a majority of the Committee, the considerations outlined in paragraphs 7 to 12 inclusive of this Report constitute an insuperable objection to the adoption of Scheme C and have led that majority to the conclusion set out in paragraph 13.     The third Member of the Committee differs from this Conclusion, for the reasons set out in the Statement attached to the Report. 7. It is admitted that the results to beexpected are largely guesswork.    There are no Government or other statistics available upon which any reliable estimates can be based.    Erom the view-point of introducing a measure into Parliament this conclusions.We were impressed by the case advanced inof the arguments against the proposal.In the
is a serious drawback as estimates of the cost and of the results would fall between wide limits.    In the first year the gross cost might be anything from  15,000,000 to  30,000,000 - there is no firm estimate.    Not only is the number of persons who would take the -oens ion conjectural but the proportion of replacements is little more than a guess.    Is it possible to contemplate the passage through the present Parlia.ent without considersDie difficulty of a measure of which the results and costs are wholly uncertain?8. Accepting for the moment the estimates given inthe Report, the scheme cannot be described as providing new work for 230,000 unemployed workers.    These men would only be placed in industry at the price of removing 390,000 elderly men permanently from productive employment: there would be no increase in the sum total of employment, or of productive capacity in the country.   No real comparison can therefore be made between the cost of this scheme and thct of relief schemes which are designed to add to the national assets.     Expenditure on retirement pensions is in the main unproductive in this sense9. A majority of the Coamittse feel that from another point of view the scheme might be described as providing a life pension of 30/- a week to an elderly married man in . lace of unemployment benefit, which may be temporary, at the rate of 26/- for a younger man and his wife.10. Ve feel that the figures given in the.Report afford a very misleading picture of the actuarial burden of thescheme in placing younger persons in employment.       It isshown tn the Renort that if the cost ox the scheme is -averaged over a period of 15 years the equalised annuala /a;.-&quot; &apos;;; :charge for the 15 years is calculated to be about
 11,000,000.      This gives a gross cost of  165,000,000. what would be obtained for this expenditure?     The elderly men who would retire because of the scheme would in any case have given up work at some time during the next 15 years, and we are informed that the amount of employment which would be released by their present retirement would represent, on the average, 5-g- years&apos; employment for every younger worker   who filled a vacancy.       The. correct annual figure of cost of placing the younger workers in employment is therefore  165,000,000 divided by 5f which gives a figure of  30,000,000 a year.      In fact 5f years of employment for 230,000 persons or 280,000 persons (according to the estimate taken) would be bought at a gross cost to the Exchequer of  30,000,000 a year, or, allowing for saving of unemployment benefit, at a net cost to public funds of some  20,000,000 a year instead of the much smaller burden contemplated in the Ministerial Addendum.On the basis, therefore,   cf putting 230,000 persons into work the cost per head per year would be about  130 gross and  90 net instead of only  50 as claimed.If the unemployment figures fall materially within the nezt 5-i- years part of the expenditure on this scheme could be said to have been spent unnecessarily.If however,  the unemployment situation at the and of- the period shows no material improvement, then we shall be again in the same position as we now find ourselves, and it may be necessary to provide a further retirement pension scheme on approximately the same lines and the same scale of expenditure as Scheme &quot;C&quot;.On the most favourable assumption that s-i the end of the 5^- years period industry would have recovered sufficiently to absorb the 230,000 (or 280,000) workers covered by Scheme &quot;C&quot;, the country would have tided over
the 5%- years at a eost of  165,000,000.11. If this scheme were adopted the cost per head of social services which is already considerably higher in Great Britain than in any other country would he materially increased, and this ---:ould have to he considered in relation to its possible effect on world competitive markets.IE, It appears to a majority of the Coujnittee thatwidespread discontent &quot;would be caused by the operation of the scheme owing to inequalities of treatment as between individuals and as between classes of workers. Even those among the favoured classes who took the pension might feel at a later date that they had made a had bargain, while those who did not avail themselves of the option would undoubtedly feel they had a grievance when at a later date they wished to give up work.       Still more dissatisfaction would he expressed by workers who reached 60 after the critical date and found that pensions were not available for them.     Unrest would centre round those retirement pensions during the whole period of their survival and both inside and outside Parliament there would be almost irresistible pressure to enlarge the scope of the scheme.    So far as attempts were made to meet these demands increased Exchequer charges would be incurred, but it is difficult to see hov; anything&apos; less than a permanent scheme on the same basis would substantially remove the grievances caused by differentiation of treatment.      Indeed the authors of the Scheme recognised the importance of these considerations and for this reason formulated the permanent Scheme E as a supplement to Scheme C.The other Member   of the Committee is of opinion that it is possible to attach too much weight to objections of this character which apply to almost any scheme of
social reform.13. In the light of the foregoing considerations \?ecannot accept the view that a special scheme of retirement pensions of this kind would be a satisfactory contribution towards the&apos; solution of the general unemployment problem, and accordingly we are unable to recommend the Cabinet to entertain the scheme.(Signed)A. V. ALEXANDER. .   (Chairman) E. W. PETHICK LAWRENCE.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.Vv&apos;.l. December 19th, 1929...STATEMENT BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF TRADE.. I am in general agreement with the Report of my - Colleagues so far as it sets out factors which must be taken into account in considering whether or not this emergency scheme of retirement pensions should be adopted.    As will be seen, however,.I cannot subscribe to their views on the particular matters referred to in paragraphs 9 and 12,The conclusion which I have reached after very care-ful examination of the whole question, .is that this emergency scheme of retirement pensions would, if put into operation immediately, materially relieve the present unemployment situation and that its cost could be justified and its limitations maintained on this ground alone*     Further,  on balance,&apos;! consider that the benefits likely to result from, its adoption would outweigh the political and administrative difficulties to which attention has been drawn.. The consideration to which I attach the greatestweight is that the scheme will give opportunity of work to young persons who have at present no prospect of obtaining: employment.(Signed)    V/. ..R. SMITH. .Board of Trade,December 19th, .1929. .
