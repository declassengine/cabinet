Sub-Committee on the Policy of the &quot;L5)I-:0?^.irjDTJLI 01 CX.AI1IS AGAIII3T &amp;0V:Wi*3Di!T3 AI03IHG OUT OF LK-UIDAiflOIIS OV Elf alii&quot; 3USIITjjb3 35.1,     The liquidation of enemy businesses gives rise to various questions which must be settled in determining tie policy to be followed as to claims by or ajvinst the enemy.   Upon some of these questions&apos; wo are not agreed, and as to such points it is only possible to state the various alternative courses and give the arguments for and against- each of them.-2.     Tha right of a sovereign State to wind up any enemy enterprise carrying on business in its territory cannot be ques-tioned, and, in fact, a largo number of enemy businesses have been and are boing wound up both by the Allies and by the Central Powers. The more fact of liquidation affords no basis for a claim.3. On the other hand such businesses are private property and the confiscation of civilian private property on land is now regarded as &quot;an act of barbarism and contrary to the lawo of war. The owner of a business is, on those principles, entitled to the not proceeds of its liquidation.4.     It follows also that in order to avoid any element of confiscation reasonable care must be exorcised in the realisation of tho assets, the management of the property, and tho settlement of all debts and claims upon it.5,     I  tho net proceeds of the liquidation are the property of the owners of the business they may be regarded as con-stituting a debt owing to such owners and the payment to them of such proceeds may well be effected in the same &quot;manner as the settlement of privato pro-war debts.     If a &quot;Clearing Bouse&quot; system is adopted for the settlement of private debts through the medium of tho Governments it will be an advantage to extend it to the -oroceeds of these liquidations.
6.     Up to this point there is no difference of opinion, but we are not agreed on the question whether the proceedings of the liquidators should be regarded as final and conclusive on the private parties interested or whether the owner of the business-should be allowed to examine the record and acquaint himself with the steps taken in the liquidation of his business, and to put forward claims against the liquidating Government in respect of the liquidation.7.     There are three courses which might be taken(a) to treat the proceedings of the liquidators as final and conclusive and so bar all claims against Governments arising out of the liquidationson either sidej(b) to make the enemy accept as final the pro-oesdings in the liquidation of businesses in the British Empire and at the same time to compel him to allow the proceedings in liquidations of British businesses in the enemy countries to be reviewed;(c) to admit a right on either side to put forward claims with reference to the liquidations.8.     The principgyi argument in favour of (a) - and conse-quently against (c) - is th^tf-MmXttf would be achieved when the liquidations are completed.     In the case of the British Empire generally, and probably in the case of Germany and Austria, there is no reason to assume that the liquidations have not been carried out with proper care, and substantial justice done. There is therefore, it is argued, no need for the individuals to see the details of the liquidators1 proceedings, or to be given an opportunity of questioning them.     It is also arg-ued that, if the liquidators1 proceedings can be challenged, it will be difficult in practice, whatever restrictions are imposed, to confine claims within reasonable limits.     If a right is admitted to question proceedings on any grounds at all, pretexts would be found.for alleging that these grounds were present in each particular case.     There is nothing which need be concealed in connection with liquidations which have been carried out in them
3rijb4SLbr Jihnpire, but it is urged that if numerous claims and pro-longed corrtxwecrST are to be avoided the only practicable course is to refuse altogether to allow the liquidators1 accounts to be inspected, or their acts to be questioned by the enemy owner.The arguments against (a) - and consequently in favour of (c) - are that British subjects will certainly desire full in-formation as to the treatment of their businesses in enemy countries, and if the information when obtained shows ground for claims, they will certainly be dissatisfied if all remedy is barred,     This applies, not only to proceedings taken in Germany and Austria, but also, with greater force, to Bulgaria and Turkey. Moreover, to insist on finality for our liquidators1 proceedings would be misunderstood and would be thought to indicate that the proceedings would not bear investigation.It is contended that, as the businesses were private property, the owners cannot justly be deprived of all information as to how they have been treated, but should have access to the records and accounts of the winding up.     If such access is allowed, some errors are sure to come to light which ought to be put right, and therefore machinery should be provided for the purpose.   So far as concerns enemy businesses in the British Empire, if there has been fair dealing it will bear investigation; and if there has not, justice ought to be done to the party who has suffered.9.     The arguments in favour of (b) are that it enables justice to British concerns wound up by the enemy to be secured without the risk of any inconvenience as to enemy businesses wound up in the British Empire,The arguments against (b) are that the avoidance of this inconvenience cannot be regarded as a matter of such primary importance as to make it necessary to force a one-sided settle-ment upon the enemy, and that there is advantage in removing as many points as practicable from the class of settlements to be imposed by force, into that of reciprocal arrangement.   A one sided settlement pre-supposes an allied victory so complete that
compensation for any British businesses unjustly treated in the winding up might equally be obtained by exacting an indemnity, and therefore no advantage would really result from adopting (b). However, assuming that the Allies achieve complete victory, it is desirable that they should impose terms consonant with the principles of justice for which they are fighting.10.     We are agreed that if proposal (c) is adopted, andconsequently parties on both sides are allowed to challenge theproceedings of the liquidators, tho following limitations shouldbe imposed :-(i) Tho right of a belligerent Government to windup and enemy business at any time being admitted, no claim for compensation or damage should arise merely from the exercise of that right, or from the date at which it w^s exercised.I(ii) No claim should be admitted on the ground of any act, neglect, or default of the liquidator if he acted in good faith, and with reasonable care and skill.   This would, e.g., excludo any claim founded merely on the price realised by a sale of a business or property if the sale has been carried out with care and skill.(iii) In the case of the sale of any business, concession, - or property, no claim should be admitted based on the fact that persons of foreign nationality, origin, or association, have been oxcluded from the right to purchase..(iv) Ho claim should be admitted.on the ground&apos;of.the choice of persons as liquidators apart from the action taken by those persons.Strict limitations, such as these, will certainly give riseto objections on the part of British Claimants, but, it isimportant to prevent the unreasonable extension of proceedingswith references to businesses liquidated in the British Empire,we therefore think it is necessary that such conditions shouldbe imposed.11.     It is right to mention that in the case: of certain businesses, for reasons other than those mentioned in 10.(iii), particular British subjects have been excluded from the right to tender, and, in at least one case, the highest tender has been rojected.     This exceptional course has been adopted for perfectly valid reasons in the public interest, but it is a
question whether it is consistent with the principle of non-confiscation of private property and with tho obligation to realise the property to the host advantage.     In cases where the highest tender has been rejected, the propriety of account-ing to tho enemy for tho -sum offored, and not merely for the sum realised, should be considered.   The facts may not be known to the owner of the business sold, and therefore he may not.be in a position to formulate a claim, but if they became known to him at a later date considerable explanation rnijht be required to justify the action of Eia ilajeaty^s Government.     In other cases, if there is evidence that excluded tenderers -would have offered a higher price, 3ome consideration might be given to claims for compensation.IE.     If ;.ny claims by parties interested are to be allowed at all, they should not be brought before the courts of justice, but should be referred for rapid settlement to one or more small bodies of exports in each country with arrangements for final decision &quot;by an impartial body of a similar charatcer, v/here necessary.&quot;Taatever course is selected, it is essential that the settlement should be a final one, and that thoso cases should not be re-openod later either diplomatically or in the courts. Provisions to this effect should be inserted in the Treaty of Pe-aco,. and any necessary legislation should be passed.13.,    vIq have not dealt with the question of claims arising out of liquidations in occupied territories, becanso we. propose to make a separate report on that subject.With regard, to liquidations in Egypt and other Protected States, we consider that the same principles should be applied as in the case of the British 2mpire.
CLAIMS AGAINST BRITI-3H SUBJECTS ARISING OUT OF TEE LIQUIDATION OF 3NEKY BUSINESSES.(1) Claims against Liquidators andjGoTeramsnt Officers.It is desirable that all direct claims by the enemy ovracr of a business against a liquidator or other officer of Governiaent or person acting under the direction of Government, should be barred.     This should be dons by internal legislation and the Treaty of ?sace should provide that no claim should be based on legislation of this character.(2) Olaiia^gainst other persons.;Claims against third parties may in some cases arise out of -liquidations if there has been error or fraud.     It is only in exceptional cases that their claims will be of a nature to give rise to proceedings in the Courts, and we do not think that special provisions are required to regiilate or bar such claims.(Signed on behalf of the Committee) ^E. 3A3INGT0N S^ITE, (Chairman).MEMBERS .02 THE OO^gTTEE^Sir R. 3,-bington Smith, Z.C.B., 0.3.1., (in the Chair).The Eon.
