13MINISTRY OP SHIPPING,St.James&apos;s Park, S.W.128th April-, 1917-..z.Sir.In continuation of my letter of the 19th instant, I am directed by the Shipping Controller to report, for the information of the War Cabinet, as follows:-MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING.     Progress has been as satisfactory as the supply of material will permit.     There is, however, an insufficient supply of material, especially in the Clyde district.     Delays occur in transit between the steel Yforks and yards, especially on the North East coast... The total amount of wages paid during the last week amounted to  240,676, of which  78,899, or 33  was paid on merchant v/ork.     Eight Munitions certificates were issued, making the total number of standard ships certified 111, and the total number ordered to date 137.     As the War Cabinet are aware the possibility of a greatly extended programme of shipbuilding is now being closely examined from the point of view of available supplies of material and labour.PURCHASE OP TONI-:AGE ABROAD.

9?Qij ^ OTOM AGE PRIORITY COMMITTEE.     The Committee has this weete considered a revised estimate of the tonnage position after an exhaustive examination of the requirements of the different Departments agreement was arrived at as to some details and as to others conflicting suggestions   were made.    It was agreed that the Chairman should draw up a report embodying the results and adjusting requirements to tonnage available, that each Department should offer observations whether of agreement or dissent and that the whole subject should there be submitted to the War Cabinet for decision as to adjustments for which Departments could not be expected to take complete responsibility .     This report will be ready within a day or two.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   John Anderson.
