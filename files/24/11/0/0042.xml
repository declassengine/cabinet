Printed for the Use of the Reconstruction Committee. April 1917.RECONSTRUCTION  COMMITTEE.German Post-War Economic Policy.V.-ECONOMIC NATIONALISM IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.The summoning of the Austrian Reichsrat will bring to the surface the strong currents of opposition on the part of the various Nationalist groups in Austria to the &quot; Central-Europe &quot; idea promulgated by the Germans and German-Austrians. As is well known, the Cternian-Austrian parties have combined to urge upon the Austrian Government a policy for the Germanisation of Austria which was to be the prelude to an economic alliance between the German Empire and Austria-Hungary itself a prelude to wider schemes of economic dominance in South-Eastern Europe and nearer Asia. The extract printed below is interesting as making it clear that such a policy would never commend itself to the nationalities concerned, and ,could only be carried out by virtue of the military ascendancy of the dominant Power. The singular frankness of the article may be attributed to the fact that it appeared in a learned periodical published in a small University town in South Germany. The description of the Germans as &quot; the greatest and most talented among the weaker peoples &quot; is peculiarly apt, and may well be prophetic. It has been ascertained by private inquiry that the writer is a retired Austrian civil servant of Jewish extraction.The article is also interesting as a criticism of the idea of &quot;economic leagues &quot; in general, and its arguments would appear to be susceptible of wider application.Extract from an Article by Ludwig von Mises in the Archiv fur Sozialwissensehaft und Sozialpolitik, a learned periodical published at Tubingen, December 1916, pages 580 to 585.The writer discusses the situation created by the division of the world into great empires (e.g., the British, the Russian, the U.S.A.), and the arguments put forward by Nauraann, the author of the much-discussed book, Mitteleuropa, and Renner, the leading thinker among the German-Austrian Socialists, that Germany should carve out an economic empire in the Near East.   He then continues as follows : &quot; It is true that it is very difficult for the small nations to maintain their inde-pendence side by side with the great world empires of the Anglo-Saxons, the Russians, and the yellow races, and it is therefore natural for them to draw together so as to secure the strength  or common resistance. It is natural, too, that the Germans, as the greatest and most talented amongst the weaker peoples, should take the lead in such an alliance. But there are two obstacles which still stand in the way of this com-bination, necessary as it may seem as a measure of self-preservation. First, there is the political constitution and general temper of German life, which embody a spirit of authoritarianism which has long since come to be regarded as obsolete by the other peoples of the world; and secondly, there is the fact that the future alliance is con-ceived by the Germans primarily as an economic league. The Magyars, Roumanians, Serbs, Bulga-rs, and all the other peoples between Berlin and Bagdad, will not and cannot renounce the idea of establishing national industries of their own. They refuse to remain agricultural peoples, producers of raw material, and markets for German industrial exports. They refuse to look on while their surplus population streams away in emigration to Germany, to be Germanised as workmen in the German factories. They would perhaps be willing to enter into a political union with the German empire, to form an offensive and defensive alliance for the protection of their State independence, but they will never consent to an economic and customs union. They would gladly see an increase in the openings for their agricultural produce in Germany and Austria, but they will never renounce the idea of setting up national industries of their own and so gradually driving out German imports from their markets.z  (33)2656-3*  Wt 61481-51   125  4/17   e&amp;s
,.&quot; Wo are told that the effect ol an economic league will :ba to:cement the common loyalty of the different members of a State composed of many nationalities.&quot; Let us test this assumption in the light of existing facts. Look first at the relationship between Austria and Hungary. The two States, which are by law completely independent and empowered to regulate their commercial relations with foreign powers without regard for one another&apos;s interests, form a single customs area. This customs union is of advantage to both parties&apos;. It offers Austrian industries a valuable market in which they do not need to fear the competition of more advanced industrial States, while Hungarian agriculture can sell its produce at a price higher to the extent of the tariff than the price in the world market. On the other hand, the customs union is an obstacle to the growth of Hungarian national industries. This makes it insupportable to Hungarian national feeling, and it would long since have abrogated if Hungarian legislation and administration had not discovered how to wage successful warfare against Austrian imports into Hungary even without the protection of a tariff.. Austria and Hungary live under a condition of customs and currency union, but they do, not live in a condition of economic union, but rather in a state of permanent economic warfare. Thus Hungary has succeeded in calling to life and maintaining national industries of her own, even without the setting up of an independent tariff. But this attempt has only succeeded under conditions of constant friction and controversy between the two halves of the empire, conditions which have caused a great deal of bad blood. The common life of the two States has been the most unfortunate conceivable, and that not in spite, bat just because of, the customs union.&quot; Let us now pass to the conditions in Austria proper. The Germans and the Czechs, the two strongest nations numerically, have common interests as against the Hungarians and the other nations in Austria proper. It is true that industrial life m Bohemia is more strougly developed in the German-speaking districts than in the Czech-speaking districts. But the industrial development of. the Czech-speaking districts is, very remarkable compared with that of the rest of Austria. The greater part of the industries of the Czech-speaking districts are still in the hands of German entrepreneurs, but these undertakings all contribute to the prosperity and strength of the Czech nation; moreover, Czechs hope sooner or later to be able to &quot; Slavise &quot; their management. Both races in Bohemia have therefore the same national interests, as against the still predominantly agricultural portion of the monarchy. Both are threatened by any narrowing of the common customs area of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy; both have to fear the industrialisation of Hungary and Galicia. It is this community of interests as against the outside world which conceals from the super-ficial observer the bitter economic war which is being waged inside the country itself. Every trade, every undertaking, every single factory is a scene of conflict, not a conflict waged purely on economic grounds, not carried on by entrepreneurs who are thinking only of the profits to be derived from their enterprises,, but a national conflict, in which the leaders are primarily politicians and literary men, the kind of men whom Renner contemptuously calls &apos; non-economic&apos; And behind these leaders stand not. only those who hope to draw profit from the changed conditions, but the serried ranks of the nation as a whole, which looks upon industrialisation as a tand-marh on the road to national greatness and national prosperity. The autonomous administration in Bohemia takes part. in. this conflict both in the provincial areas and in the, communes; so do the great national banks, savings banks, and co-operative societies, who in all their business dealings have regard not only for considerations of profit, but for the advancement of the nation to which they belong.&quot;It is not only German entrepreneurs in Austria, against whom this Czech economic campaign is waged, who deplore these conditions, but everyone who cares for Austria and is concerned as to her future ; for it is conditions such as these which push Austria into the background in her competition with the Great Powers. It is indeed obvious that if Austria, which, regarded as a single economic area, is already none too -large and has been none too bountifully endowed by nature, is to be broken up in this way into a number. of miniature areas, there can be no real possibility of the development of any specialised form of industrial life. One may deplore these conditions as much as one likes (and I am not disposed to deny that I deplore them myself), but it serves no purpose to deny them.&quot; Of the other nations which live together in the Austria-Hungarian customs area, the Ruthenians, Roumanians, and Slovenes are still at so low a stage of economic development that they cannot yet contemplate a policy of protection for their industries.   Their nationalist endeavours on the economic side are directed
* In this connection finance is a factor second only in importance to trade e.g., the Germans and Czechs, by the disproportionate amount of taxation -which they pay, contribute substantially to the cost of administering the other parts of the Empire.rather to the intensification of their agricultural production, and in this they are assisted, as far as possible, by the general agricultural policy of the monarchy. But there can be no doubt that the time will come when these nations also will make an attempt to establish national industries ; in fact indications to this effect are already manifest to-day,&quot; The nascent industrial efforts of the Serbo-Croats in Croatia-Slavonia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina have already been crowned by a certain measure of success. The Italians are prevented by their social structure in Istria and Dalmatia from adopting any definite form of protectionist policy; they are an upper-class town population without a hinterland of fellow-nationals. The Italian Tyrol is too poor in possibilities of development for any attempt at a special economic policy to be made.&quot; The protectionist efforts of the Poles in Galicia are directed primarily against the industries of Western Austria. In the eyes of a nationalist Pole any article prodiiced in Russian or Prussian Poland is just as much a home product as one produced in Galicia, whereas anything produced outside this area, say, in Western Austria, is foreign. For many years past the Galician administration, and not only the autonomous bodies in the administration of the province, the districts, and the communes, but also the officials of the central government in. so far as they happen to be Poles, have done their best to industrialise Galicia. These efforts are, it is true, in some cases not directed against West Austrian imports (e.g., in the case of petro-leum and timber) ; in other branches of production, however, as in the sugar and paper industries, the ultimate object of driving out West Austrian imports is clearly revealed.&quot; All the various peoples united in the Austro-Hungarian customs union are trying to make as much as they can out of it for their own nation and to sacrifice as little as they can. Every single nation is trying to maintain the union only in so far and so long as it is profitable to itself.*&quot; On the battlefields of Serbia and Poland, Galicians, German-Austrians, Poles, and Magyars have had to defend common political interests. Politically they are mutually dependent. In questions of national economic policy, however, there is the same conflict of interests between them as is revealed everywhere between old indus-trial peoples and agricultural peoples in process of industrialisation. It is not because they threaten their political independence that the Magyars fear the German-Austrians  there is not an Austrian who has such an idea in his head but because Austrian industries are the chief competitors of Hungarian industries.&quot; The lesser nations of Europe will be forced by the smallness of their territory and population to be the first among the peoples of the world to learn the lesson that the idea of self:sufficiency for their national industries is impossible of realisation. They will before long be compelled to combine economically, as they have seen themselves compelled to combine politically. Such a league mighty of course, come into being as a result of the military subjection of one group by another. But, provided it is formed on a basis of freedom, it can enjoy no expectation of permanence unless it provides all its members with the opportunity of reaching the same stage of industrial and agricultural development. An economic league of nations based on any other principle cannot hope to be lasting.&quot; The friction between Austria and Hungary was greatest in the period when Hungarian industrialism was in its infancy. The stronger Hungarian industry grows the less it will have to fear the competition of Austria, and the more clearly will the common interests of the two countries as against the outer world be revealed.&quot; The real analogy for the Central European customs league, whether it extends to Bagdad or to Orsova, is not the uniform German customs union, but the variegated Austro-Hungarian customs area, in which it is the centrifugal tendencies which are dominant. Thus, to compare the Central European economic area with such great commercial powers as England, Russia, and France, is. to forget that the foreign, elements in those empires were incorporated by a process of conquest and subjection, not by voluntary union, and that they are still to-day retained, and will continue to be retained, by the sword.&quot;
