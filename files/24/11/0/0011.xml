SECRET. 2 7]ffl[]tlSTRT  OF  FOQD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, April 18, 1917,r;      -&quot; &apos;. -     .     ! - PART I. ACTION TAKEN.Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.&quot; - The following Orders were made by the Food Controller during the week : (1). Wheat, Barley, and Oats (Prices) Order, 1917, dated April 16, 1917.   This ji  &apos;   &quot; Order fixes the maximum prices for wheat, barley (other than&quot; kiln-driedbarley), and oats of the 1916 crop as follows :-Wheat -      -   78s. per quarter of 480 lbs. - ;. Barley -     -  65s. per quarter of 400 lbs. ., - ; -(.&apos;- , Oats     - &apos; &apos; -   55s. per quarter of 312 lbs,. : . It enjoins that the buyer shall be,entitled to require the grain to be - placed on rail or (at the seller&apos;s option) to be delivered to the buyer&apos;s?,j,n     premises, and no additional charge is to be made in respect thereof.   It provides that subsisting contracts shall stand so far as concerns any ,   . grain which has been paid for or delivered or which under the contractis to be delivered within one month from the date of such contract, but that otherwise executory contracts shall be avoided. * The price of home-grown wheat had recently become so inflatedthat millers preferred to reduce their output rather than to pay the -&apos; price demanded.   The rise in the price of oats further tended unduly-----     to inflate the retail price of oatmeal and other oat products.(2) Barley (Requisition) Order, 1917, dated April 16, 1917. By virtue of this f; &apos; Order the Food Controller takes over all barley other than home-growni:. , barley which has not been kiln dried.    The owners of barley arer:; .      &apos;       required to maintain the barley in good condition and on or beforeApril 30-to forward to the Food Controller particulars of their holdings. ,,-v. r        . , The -Order does not apply to persons who do not own more than25 quarters of barley, or to barley which is in the hands of millers orwhich has been sold to the Wheat Commission. .&apos; The object of the Order was to.ensure the conservation for humanfood of all existing/stocks of barley in the country.,r . ., (3) Cake and Pastry Order, 1917, dated April 18, 1917. This Order prohibits ;]- :      the production of ornamented cakes, fancy bread, or pastry for sale, and&apos;(&apos;&apos; limits the amount of wheaten flour or sugar to be used in the baking of.&apos;- all cakes, buns, scones and biscuits.   It comes into operation, as regardsbaking, on April 22, and as regards sale, on April 25 ; but an exception is made in favour of any cake or biscuit proved to have been made before April 23. The Order applies to articles supplied in clubs&apos;in the same manner as to articles supplied for sale. This part of the Order carries into effect the announcement made by the Food Controller in the House o&apos; of Lords on March 22.An important provision of this Order relates to the rationing of v. tea-shops, and applies to every public eating place as defined in thePublic Meals Order, 1917, but which is excepted from the operation of that Order under the clause relating- to the service of Is. 3d. meals only. The provision is that no individual customer shall be served at any meal whatsoever which begins between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. . with more than 2 ozs. in the whole of bread, cake, bun, scone and biscuit.   This provision, which comes into force on April 23, does not....... i.- , ,.   apply to public eating places where no customer is ever charged morejthan Qd. in respect of a meal including beverages but not. including .&apos;i.&apos; V .meat, fish or eggs, when served between 3 p.in. and 6 p.m., provided,V   V ,.that notice to this effect is publicly displayed!   The effect will be toy limit the undue consumption of food in all ordinary tea-shops without-*&apos;&quot;&apos;.&quot; A &quot;&quot;   interfering with shops which cater exclusively for the poorer classes. -A   (,33)2795-2   Pk 1  40  4/17  E &amp; S &apos;&quot;
Control of Prices &quot;and Supplies.At a conference held at Grosvenor House on Thursday, April 12, to consider the purchase Of food supplies for&apos;ihe Allies from the United-States-of America.- Lord Devonport outlined a scheme for focussing in a single.hand such purchases as were not yet focussed, in view of the assistance secured by the adhesion of the United States to the Allied cause. Mr. Hoover proposed that all Allied buying committees and agents in New York should be consolidated into one body ; that the buying demands of the Allies should be concentrated in a single hand; and that the United States Government should issue licences for the export of goods purchased through the consolidated organisation and. for no others. Mr. Hoover subsequently submitted a memorandum embodying his proposals.Cereals. Progress has been made with the scheme for Millers&apos; Returns devised in concert with the National Association of British and Irish Millers. The millers have been required to make weekly returns as to their output and the prices realised, and to show a comparison with the figures of the corresponding week of the preceding year. By this means it is hoped to form conclusions as to the general output and consumption throughout the country, and to provide for the prompt investigation of any price which appears to require justification. As the returns also show the percentages of admixtures used by the millers, an estimate can be made of the stocks of permitted cereals necessary to meet their requirements.Potatoes. The position as regards&apos; potato supplies remains the same as reported last week.\ ; Lord Devonport has approved a scheme submitted by Mr. Dennis for the purchase on behalf of this Ministry of all available supplies in Spain expected to be exported from that country as the result of negotiations.between the Marquis di Cortina and the Foreign Office. A maximum quantity of 45,000 tons may be available in the event of the ratification of this arrangement by the Spanish Government.j Sugar. Captain Bathurst announced in the House of Commons, on Aplril 18, that it was hoped, by reducing the: voluntary ration to \ lb. per head per week, and by allowing to the distributors a. more liberal margin Over their actual requirements on this basis, to secure more equitable distribution among consumers.As a result of the Brewers&apos; Sugar Order, 1917, licences have been granted for the delivery of some 1,500 tons of this. sugar for manufacturing purposes. The number of populous areas in which inspections have Been made has been increased to 221, and the number of these areas in which additional supplies of sugar have been recommended is now 77. .... ., . i&apos;-   -In the early part of this week another cargo of some 6,000 tons was lost through the sinking of a vessel by an enemy submarine. On the other hand, a reduction in the issues for the week, owing to the Easter interruption of business, effected a corresponding saving, so that the estimate of stocks available at the end of last week was not affected. Ships are now due to arrive, and, on the assumption that further losses are avoided, the situation in respect of stocks should gradually improve, and by the end of the month should be free from anxiety. During May, if vessels arrive according to programme, it should be still further and substantially improved.Provisions. Representatives 6E various sections of the trade met on April 12 to revise the list of maximum prices for provisions applicable to importers and curers. It was considered necessary to advance the limits to American packers generally by 3a\ per cvvt., a much smaller &apos; figure than that applied for, in order to insure continued shipments. A similar advance was made in the price of Irish bacon, but English bacon was left unchanged. The maximum price for English cheese was reduced by 5s. per cwt.   This list will be revised fortnightly in future.The arrangement with the Home and Foreign Produce Exchangers working satisfactorily, and effecting.a steadying, influence on market,prices.Cargoes of butter brought from&apos; Australia and New Zealand by the s.s. &quot; Morea,&quot; &quot;Ayrshire/&apos; &quot; Wiltshire,&quot; and &quot; Osterly &quot; were requisitioned yesterday. The Food Controller is prepared to pay for this butter the market price ruling on the 17th April, the date of his Order&apos;; it is estimated that the value of the butter on this basis is a bout a million sterling; The butter is being held in cold storage by the proprietors., Hay&apos;s Wharf, Limited,&apos;on-behalf of the Food Controller.   -
PART II.-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.Imports.There was a marked improvement in the imports, of food during the week ended 14th April, the total quantity of the principal foods and feeding stuffs imported (as shown in Table A) being 222,000 tons, compared with 194,000 tons in the previous week, 217,000 tons in the corresponding week of 1916, and a weekly average of 194,000 tons in the 15 weeks from the beginning, of January to the 14th April-:- - The figures for wheat and flour, beef, bacon; and hams, lard, cheese, butter, and maize all show considerable increases,.both on the imports for the previous week-and on the weekly average for the first 35 weeks of the year. There was ;a heavy fall, however, in the imports of sugar, which amounted only to 7,600 tons, against .23,700 tons in the week ended 7th April, and a weekly average of over. 20,000 tons for the&apos; year up to, date. Barley- and oats also showed considerable red notions as compared with the. prevjous week, and the imports of oats, were much below the weekly average since January. .... .,Food Economy.The Food Economy Campaign progresses according to plan. At many of the meetings which are being held, insistent complaints are being made as. to the imrestricted use,, and, in many instances, the waste of bread and breadstuffs in army camps and canteens. It seems desirable, if the public are to be convinced of the sincerity pf the campaign, that more stringent orders should at once be issued-(1) to reduce the sale of breadstuffs in all canteens ; (2; to prohibit private individuals from sending breadstuffs to troops abroad; (3) to restrict, within the limits laid down in the Orders issued by the Ministry of Food, the amount of breadstuffs sent to prisoners of war.Brewing and Malting.The Malt (Restriction) No. 2 Order, 1917, was issued on April 12th, prohibiting except under licence - ; &apos;(1) Manufacture of malt from any cereals ; (2) Sale of any malt after April 12th ; (3) Delivery of any malt after the 14th April; (4) Use of any malt after the 14th April,The Order does not apply to sales of malt to brewers for sale made on or before February 10th, 1917, or the. brewing of beer: for sale on the barrelage allowed under Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order, 1917.- A limited quantity of licences are being issued for trade uses as follows:-Distilling for munitions and whisky; malt flour for bread and biscuits ; manufacture of cocoa, patent, foods and medicines, vinegar, and non-alcoholic beers ; textile trades and aeroplanes.Enforcement of Orders.A West of England dairyman was prosecuted to conviction On seven counts for infringing the Bread Order and was fined 140L and 101. 10s. costs.The police have been instructed to investigate a variety of alleged infringements of the Orders relating to potatoes, price of milk, and conditions on sale of food, and to prosecute if sufficient evidence is forthcoming.Licences to prosecute for infringements of the Orders relating to bread and flour have been issued to all inspectors of Weights and Measures on whose behalf application was made, including all London County Council inspectors. -Selected cases of aileged hoarding have been investigated either by inspection or by requirement of returns. In one case (in Aberdeen) where hoarding was established, the stocks were requisitioned by the Food Controller. Most of the complaints are found to be without foundation.&quot;The investigation of the complaints made about the food conditions in the East End was concluded during the week, and, except as regards sugar, it was found that the difficulties of obtaining food were exaggerated.
Notwithstanding the increase in-the week ended. 14th April, the total imports of the principal foods and feeding stuffs since the beginning of 1917 are still considerably below those of the corresponding period of 1916, amounting only to 2,914,000 tons as compared with 3,474,000 tonslast year, a reduction of 16 per cent. The principal decreases are in oats, 157,000 tons; barley, 142,000 tons ; wheat, 111,000 tons; sugar, 128,000 tons ;, and .wheaten flour, 52,000 tons. Maize shows an increase of 41,000 tons, and the imports of lard, margarine, cheese, and butter have also been somewhat greater than in the same weeks of 1916.Stocks.In Table E. particulars are given as to the estimated stocks of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the United Kingdom at 1st April 1917, with comparative figures for a year before and a month before. ;As compared with April 1st, 1916, wheat stocks ,(including flour expressed as wheat) are lower by 244,000 tons, or about. 16 per cent. To some extent this deficiency is compensated for by the. economies in consumption resulting from the Wheat Restriction Order and the Manufacture of Flour and Bread Orders. There is also a heavy deficiency in the stocks of oats and maize, and a considerable deficiency in those of butter, margarine, and cheese.The figures for barley (excluding- stocks in the hands of maltsters) are higher than last year, at 157,000 as against 132,000 tons. Under the Malt Restriction Order maltsters&apos; stocks are also now available for direct use as human food instead of for brewing. At&apos;10th March 1917 these stocks amounted to 310,000 tons. It is probable, however, that some of this had by April 1st been transferred from the maltst3rs and appears in the figure of 157,000 tons cited above.The stocks of coffee and cocoa also show considerable increases as compared with April 1916. . o   :  ,:There is an apparent increase in the stocks of rice. - The comparative figure for 1916&apos; is, however, open to doubt, and in auy case comparison is affected1 Jby- the amount of rice held by the Commission for Relief in Belgium.Stocks of beans, peas* beef and mutton, bacon and hams, and tea are at much the same level as in 1916. &apos;As compared with a month ago all cereals and fats show substantial decreases, the most striking being in the case of oats, where stocks have fallen from .919,000 to 584,000 tons (36 per cent.).- Beef&apos; also, shows a decrease, but the stocks of the other forms of meat (mutton, bacon, and hams) have all increased during the month.lea is practically stationary^   Stocks of coffee and cocoa have increased.For the chief cereals somewhat later estimates are available, as follows : -&quot; Wheat-At 16th April the estimated stocks, which had been 1,237,000 tons at 1st April, had fallen to 1,159,000 tons. At the same date in 1916 the figure was 1,463,000 tons. .. ..Barley. The estimated stocks (including those in maltsters&apos; hands) were 425,000 tons at 16th April, compared with 444,000 tons at 1st April 1917.Oats.-The stocks at 16th April were estimated at 403,000 tons, compared with 584,000 tons at 1st April 1917. This rate of decrease is practically the same as during March and, if continued, will exhaust the stocks in the middle of May.Maize. The stocks at 16th April were 153,000 tons, compared with 163,000 tons . at, 1st April 1917. .:&apos;-&apos;,--- ;.&quot; - Consumption of Meat.V     In Tables B. and C. figures are given illustrating the rate of consumption of ; meat.   All the figures for the. weeks ending&apos;April 7th and 14th, however, are clearly Effected by the Easter holiday.   . &apos; :   .- The supplies of dead meat entering the Central Market, London (Table B.), during the week ended 14th April, were almost exactly the same as in the previous-week-, and slightly below the weekly average for March, but 14 per cent, above those for the corresponding week in 1916, when supplies fell-considerably below the average. . . -      - .
For Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool markets, the latest returns available relate to the week ehded;^7th^^^Ap^il/&apos; i At .:Mjancfiester supplies were reduced, being 15 per cent, below the weekly average for. March 1917, and 29 per cent, below the figure for the spe week in 1916. At Glasgow and at Liverpool supplies were much the same as in March 1917, and in the corresponding week of 1916. Combining the figures for all the four markets, the supplies of dead meat in the week ended 7th April were 19 per cent, below those for the same week in 1916, and 3 per cent, below the weekly average for March 1917.The progressive increase, during the first three months of 1917, in the supplies of fat cattle at 51 markets (Table C), which had been interrupted by a sharp decrease in the week ended 4th April, was resumed in the week ended 11th April, the total for that week showing a rise of 21 per cent, over the figure for the previous week, of 10 percent, over the average for the corresponding weeks in the years 1914-16, and of 2 per cent, over the average for March. 1917.The entries of fat sheep were also higher, by about 18 per cent., than in the week ended 4th April, but they showed only a slight increase on the average for March and were 6 per cent, below the average of the corresponding weeks in 1914-16. The, decline in the number of fat pigs marketed continued, the figure for the week ended 11th April being slightly below that for the previous week, 10&quot; per cent, below the average for March 1917, and 20 per cent, below that for the same weeks of the years 1914-16.; Wholesale Prices.The latest available wholesale prices of home-grown cereals and of flour (Table D) all show increases on those for the previous week, British wheat having risen by lOd. a quarter; flour by Is. a sack; British barley by Is. lid. a quarter, and British oats by 2s. Id a quarter. Rangoon rice also rose by Is. 9d. per cwt. As regards meat, the price of English beef rose by Is. per cwt., Argentine mutton, by 5s. per cwt., and Danish bacon by 4s. per cwt.; but there was no change in. Irish or Canadian bacon, and a decrease of Is. 6d. per cwt. in Argentine chilled beef and English mutton. The prices of English Cheddar and Canadian cheese and of sugar were also unchanged, and Danish and New Zealand butter showed decreases of Is. 6d and 2s. per cwt. respectively. Prices for tea are not available, the public auctions having been suspended for the week. As regards oilseeds and cake, there were substantial increases, in the prices of linseed (7s. per quarter), of palm kernels (15s. per ton), and of linseed cake (10s. per ton) ; but there was no change in Egyptian cottonseed cake or in palm kernel cake.Compared with a month ago, the principal changes are increases of 6s. 4J. per quarter (8 per cent.) in the Gazette price of British wheat, 4s. per sack (7 per cent.) in the London price of country &quot; straight run &quot; flour (though the price of the new war flour at London is only 6cL above that of the corresponding flour a month ago), 7s. dd. per quarter (12 per cent.) in the price of British barley, 7s. lOd. per qiiarter (10 per cent.) in British oats, and 9s. per cwt. (9 per cent.) in Argentine mutton, and a fall of 9s. per cwt. (4 per cent.) in New Zealand butter and of 20s. per ton (7 per cent.) in palm kernel cake. Rice, English beef and mutton, Irish bacon,. English Cheddar cheese, oilseeds, palm kernels, and linseed and cottonseed cake show slight, increases, and Argentine chilled beef, Canadian bacon, and Canadian cheese slight decreases in price ; sugar remains unchanged.Since the corresponding week of last year there has been a rise in the price ,.g  every article included in the Table, with the exception of English refined. sugar (Tate&apos;s cubes), the price of which remains at the same level. The principal increases are in oats (26s. Id. per quarter, or 87 per cent.), linseed cake (75 per cent.), palm kernel cake (74 per cent.), Calcutta linseed (62i per cent.), British wheat (32s, per quarter, or 60 per cent), Canadian cheese (55s. 6d. per cwt., or 53 per cent.), rice (9s. 9d. per cwt., or 52 per cent,, and English Cheddar cheese (54s. per cwt., or 48 per cent.). Beef shows an increase of 27s. to 32s. per cwt., or about 36 per cent, and mutton 18sQd. to 23s.&quot; per cwt., or about 21. per cent. The prices of Irish, Danish, and Canadian bacon have increased, by 32s. to 36s. per cwt. (29 to 37 per cent.), and those of imported butter by 46s.&apos; Qd. to 50s. per cwt. (27 to 31 per cent.).A  2795-2
