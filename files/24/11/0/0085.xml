E C REJ,IMPERIAL WAR CABINET - FUTURE SESSIONS.(J.T.-585-.(Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies).I venture to suggest that it would be a great misfortunef the experiment in the direction of an Imperial Cabinet which as now been made for the first time should be allowed to drop ithout any effort to continue it in some definite form, think that I know the views of several of my colleagues, ncluding the Secretary of State for India, and I believe that e should all welcome a proposal along the lines which have lready been more than once indicated by Sir Robert Borden in is speeches.rime Ministers themselves, and only the Prime Ministers, unless or some very special reason the Prime Minister is unable to ave his Dominion, In which case he should, I think, have the Ipht to nominate some high member of his own Cabinet, who aid be authorised to speak and act for him as has been the se with General Smuts on the present occasion. 12)       The Imperial Cabinet must be specially summoned the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for a definite ssion, and must, on this occasion, be distilict from the me Cabinet.
