p/HS/290.SBRMAg SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.The following is a summary of the losses of. merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which have &quot;been officially reported in the period April 20 - 26 inclusive.   The figures exclude smacks and trawlers;-Stearnships (500 tons gross &amp; over):-British.........     189,236 tons gross.Allied So Neutral .      16,477   &quot;Sailing Vessels (100 tons gross&amp; overit-British   .........        4,427   &quot;Allied &amp; Neutral .       18,110   &quot;Grand Total 228,250 tons gross.Total British,   193,663 tons gross.Of the British vessels in question three were sunk by mines;   in the case of two others it is uncertain whether the loss was due to mines or submarines.    The total loss is the heaviest recorded since the commencement of the new submarine warfare;   and the proportion of British tonnage sunk is altogether abnormal, as may be seen from the figures which we quoted in last week&apos;s sum-mary.      Among the British steamships lost were one of 11,000 tons (gross) one of 10,000 tons (gross) and twoothers of over 7,000 tons (gross).   The total number of British steamships lost was 51;   of British sailing vessels, 4.
$2. TOM AGE.        Tlie enemy snipping in South American ports amounts to 587,000 tons; of which 250,000 are in Brazil; 208,000 in Chile, 73,000 in the Argentine, 42,000 in Peru and Uruguay, 14,000 in Colombia.     This shipping might he purchased by the countries concerned; but we have no desire to give Qexmaxiy important credits in South America. We should prefer to see these ships requisitioned;    and we could then stipulate, as a condition of giving them immun-ity from capture, that the Governments making use of them should place an equivalent quantity of other tonnage at the disposal of the Allies.After a secret debate on our proposals to the Norwegian shipowners the Norwegian Storthing has decided not to intervene.     The Shipowners Association have offered us merely the tramp vessels which are now employed in the North Sea trade, to be transferred as and when cor-responding British vessels are put into trade with Norway. As regards other Norwegian vessels the Association only promise to ensure that they are actively employed in the world&apos;s trade.     The offer excludes the liners regularly engaged in North Sea trade, and this exception cannot be admitted by H.M. Government.     It is a limited arid dis-appointing offer.      But Sir M. Pin&amp;lay reports that the Association have promised verbally to do more than they dare state in writing.     They will cooperate in trans-ferring to Allied trades all ships which are at present working in distant waters, or in neutral trades other than the Norwegian.      We may be able to obtain a secret supplementary Agreement embodying this assurance, withoutwhich the offer of the Association is scarcely worth accepting.
The new Spanish Government have not yet ratified the Cortina Shipping Agreement, and are expected to make difficultios about it,UIITED STATES.      Bo far we have no news of decision made by United States Authorities in consultation with the British Mission.     But there are indications that the United States desire to undertake their full share of the burden of the war.Already  150,000,000 of the new United States loan have been placed at the disposal of Great Britain and  156,000,000 have been allocated to the expenses of the CR.B.A Bill has been submitted to the Senate for prohibiting the export of any goods without a licence. Sir C Spring Rice is already in communication with the Committee of the Department of Commerce which will administer this measure.The President of the Shipping Board now promises that he will obtain from Congress a measure authoris-ing Mr. Wilson to requisition American shipping. Apparently the Shipping Board pin their faith to wooden ships, and we shall be at liberty to acquire any steel vessels which are In the market, if we will allow them to be registered under the American Faag. The President of the Shipping Board recognises that his feud with us - over our Statutory Black List and our Bunker Policy - is out of date.We are withdrawing the Statutory Black List and the General Black List for the United States, as
from April 27.Mr, Wilson has issued a proclamation empowering German insurance companies which have hitherto done business in the United States to continue that business, provided that they do not transmit funds abroad or use their funds for the benefit of Germany and her Allies. This is a measure so much to the advantage of the United States that we cannot quarrel with it,?/e have already begun to solicit the help of the United States in various difficult negotiations.   We desire them to assist the Allies in persuading the South American Republics to make use of interned enemy shipping.     We hope that they will withhold coal and corn from Spain, until the Spanish Government accepts in full the Gortina Agreement.     We are asking them to suspend the export of fodder-stuffs to Denmark and of petroleum to Denmark and Sweden.     These requests in-volve the general principle that the United States should only permit exports to neutrals in exchange for compensating services to the Allies.   The United States are unfettered by Agreements and they have the undoubted right to regulate the export of their own products as they please.     Possibly Mr. WilsonTs Government may be induced to recognise this principle of compensation, which is capable of being applied ia many other ways besides those which have already been suggested.    The Americans are more likely to be attracted by the opport-unity of working on one broad principle than by a hund-red and one small openings for assisting us in particular controversies with neutrals.
5   -041   NORWAY, Norway is not prepared to reduce her total exportsof fish to Germany, which are fixed under our Pish Agreement at 15$ of the total catch.     But the Norweg-ian Government are willing that this quantity should he exported hy quarterly instalments - a concession which would prevent Germany from obtaining any large supplies of Norwegian fish in the near future.     Negotiations are still on foot between the Foreign Office and Nor-wegian Government;   and it is still possible that we may secure some more stringent restriction of the exports of fish to Germany,We have offered to buy from the friendly Norweg-ian canners all the fish that they can pack. Their out-put- will be limited, this year by the difficulty of obtaining tinplates.To secure further facilities for Russian transit we have decided that licences for the export ofBritish coal will be granted to the Norwegian railways strictly *   in proportion to the quantity of transit traffic which they handle month hy month.*   DENMARK * Proposes to place an embargo on the export ofbutter except to Sweden.     The reason assigned is the, difficulty of importing raw materials for margarine. The Danish Government presume that we shall not object as a large part of the last consignments of Danish butter to the United Kingdom still remains unsold. They propose to inform Germany that the cessation of butter exports is a necessary consequence of the sub-marine blockade.     As soon as the grazing season begins the export of Danish cattle to Germany will be reduced; the present rate of export is 7,000 head per week.
Since Feb.l. only five Danish vessels, other than produce boats have come to the United Kingdom.   The departure of Danish colliers (other than produce boats) from British ports has been stopped, until more Danish ships arrive.       This measure will probably produce the desired object,   as the shortage of coal in Denmark is still acute.        But, Danish owners complain that they lose on voyages to the United Kingdom, the rate of in-surance being Qfo each way.      It might be advisable to help them in obtaining lower rates.6i SWEDEN * The Government are being strongly pressed toprohibit the export of all foodstuffs.     The working-classes complain that the bread ration is insufficient and that meat is unobtainable.     In many industrial centres the sale of agricultural produce has absolutely ceased.     It is difficult to ascertain how much of meat and other foodstuffs has lately been going from Sweden to Germany, since the utmost secrecy has been observed at the ports.     But the total volume of Swedish exports to Germany has diminished enormously; and foodstuffs appear to be licenced for export only as compensation for articles which Sweden cannot herself produce.The whole country is now faced with a coal famine; many factories have closed down or are working half time;       and railway traffic has been considerably reduced, although the railways still have some stocks In hand.   During the last six months the imports of German coal have been 50$ below normal and the coal is of bad quality.
War Trade Intelligence Department.27th April 1917.The position is therefore favourable, from our point of. view.    We should be able to accelerate the exit of Allied tonnage from the Baltic through the  ogrund Passage;     and we. need not fear that the draft Anglo-Swedish Agreement will be unreasonably amended. At^the same time we have to avoid exciting Swedish public opinion against the Allies, so long as Russia needs transit facilities over the Swedish Railways.h. w: G. 3).
