The meeting, which was attended by almost all the Chairmen, after being informed of the extreme seriousness of the situation with regard to the food supply, was informed in the plainest terms of the immense task which will be placed upon Executive Committees in order to increase the area under tillage for the 1918 Harvest to the extent which the Department considers necessary and possible.The attitude of the Chairmen was such as to afford every hope that the Executive Committees throughout the country will riso to the occasion, and will not hesitate to use, where necessary, the formidable powers with which they have been provided.I. LOCAL ORGANISATION.Work of Agricultural Executive Committees. The following are instances of specific action taken by County CommitteesHampshire. The Committee have taken possession of a small holding of 10 acres at Easton.
Kent.        The Committee have taken possession of 150 acres, part of a farm belonging to a speculating Company, at St-Margaret&apos;s-at-Cliffe the whole of the farm, which consists of 230 acres, was being used solely for grazing four cows and a few sheep;    the Committee propose breaking up the 150 acres for the 1918 crop, Norfolk. The Committee have taken possession of Manor Farm, Tibenham. Suffolk, East.

The Committee are taking possession of Crown Lands Farm, Walsham, High Fields and Gustofts Farms, Rougham, and Quakers&apos; Farm, Beyton.Sussex, West. The Committee, in arranging for the 1917 crop, considered it impracticable to deal with the Weald Clay District. They are now taking this district in hand for the purpose of the 1918 crop.Carmarthenshire. The Committee have taken possession of 24 acres at Llannon, and also of fields for allotments at Llannon, Whitland, and Newcastle-Emlyn.Drainage of Lands Order. Several of the counties are taking steps to enforce this Order by regulating the flow of water through mills and by securing the cleansing of channels and the maintenance of banks of rivers and streams;   notably - Norfolk, Bedfordshire, West Sussex (where a Sub-Committee has been appointed for the purpose which is to form other Sub-Committees for each drainage basin), Somerset, and Flint, (which is dealing with the drainage of low lands near the railway at Prestatyn and at Rhyl).
Many of the Committees report having granted applications J of farmers for credit under the existing rules, hut it is clear that the system will have to be greatly extended in future if the full programme of increased food production for 1918 is to he effectively realised.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2)iThe particulars received up to this date show that in 855 Boroughs or Urban Districts 144,048 applications for land have been made under the provisions of the Order, and that 123,116 plots, comprising a total area of 9,000 acres, have been allotted.In addition the reports show that plots are still being provided by landowners independently of the Order, and that there is a demand for new permanent allotments under the Small Holdings and Allotments Acts.   -In South Wales, a considerable number of permanent allotments, particularly in Glamorganshire, have been provided on very advantageous terms for the cultivators.The County Agricultural Executive Committees are freely exercising their powers under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 191? (No. 3), so as to enable Parish Councils to provide land for temporary cultivation, in many cases with a view to the land being retained after the period of the War as permanent allotments.IIorticultural Section. During the week 427 allotment societies, with a combined membership of over 80,000, have applied for and received information and advice; 3,217 private individuals have applied for and received pamphlets; 32 additional Horticultural Representatives have been appointed including 27 for Anglesey and Carnarvon, making a total of 132.Orders for 5,300 Knapsack Spraying Machines have now been placed with three firms, and arrangements are being made
for the purchase, packing, and distribution of copper sulphate, soda, etc. for potato spraying.II. TECHNICAL.AND ADVISORY.The drafting of the series of Bulletins on the need for economy in the use of feeding stuffs is now practically completed. A memorandum on the relation of the poultry industry to the food shortage has been prepared.   The proposal for the state purchase of half fat cattle in the coming autumn with a view to their immediate slaughter and storage has also been considered and a memorandum on the subject prepared.The Sub-Committee are enquiring into different systems of inter-cropping with special reference to those practised in Belgium.   Information is being collected with regard to the milk supply of towns with a population of over 100,000.Notes have been supplied to the press on the eradieation of Bracken and Gorse, the rolling of oats on newly ploughed land, and the provision of winter keep on grass dairy farms.III.       LABOUR.Soldier Labour - The soldiers now engaged on agricultural work number approximately.41,000.    A number of men, however, have been withdrawn owing to military exigencies.   A few Agricultural Executive Committees have called attention to the lateness of the season, and the large amount of sowing still to be done, and have urged that none of the aoldiers should be withdrawn until substitutes can be provided.The Nottingham Executive Committee have devised a scheme for the training of a few soldiers of Agricultural Companies in the shearing&apos;.of sheep by machines, the period of training to last one week.   The scale of charges should make
the scheme self-supporting.Civilian Prisoners of War - The Isle of Man has been visited, and conferences held with the Commandants of the Internment Camps there,., with a view to ascertain how many of the Civilian Prisoners are likely to volunteer for farm work.     The Depart-ment had been allocated 500 of the first thousand men to volunteer.     The Commandant at Knockaloe stated that he thought there would be little difficulty in getting 500 men at that Camp to volunteer, and as regards the camp at Douglas, 200 men are expected to offer their services.A deterrent to volunteering has existed In the fact that in some cases when an interned man has taken up work, the Board of Guardians has reduced the maintenance allowance granted to his wife and family, on the ground that he could afford to make them some payment out of his earnings.     This difficulty is, to some extent, being &quot;surmounted in consultation with the Home Office and the Local Government Board.Women&apos;s Branch. There are now available in England and Wales 204 training centres, of which 6 take Non-National Service women, and 14 are under the Yv&apos;omen&apos;s Farm and Garden Union.     These centres could provide for 1,699 women, of which 88 would be Non-National Service students.     From different parts of the country satisfactory reports are received of the results of the training provided.The first returns have new been received showing the numbers of National Service Volunteers who have enrolled for work on the land.     The returns are not entirely complete, but there are only a very few counties which have sent in no return at all.     The Reports of the Departments Inspectors shew that, generally speaking, the girls are of a good type, 846 have been called up, and of these 623 have been accepted
mand 223 rejected.     185 women have been sent to Instruction Centres;   86 are receiving training on farms with the assistance of maintenance grants, and in addition, there are 161 under train-ing who have not enrolled und-,r the National Service Scheme.The manufacturers who are providing the Outfits are not keeping up their promised rate of production, and the deliveries during the week, in spite of the efforts of this Department and the Contracts Branch of the War Office, have been far below the number required.MACHINERY SECTION. Motor Tractors - A further 47 Tractors (of the 600 originally ordered through the Ministry of Munitions) have arrived in this country and been despatched to Agricultural Executive Committees.

SUPPLIES. \ Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Section. A revised memorandum has been sent to Agricultural Executive Committees containing information as to the supplies of fertilisers for this year&apos;s crops.Sulphate of Ammonia    Returns for the first half of the month indicate that deliveries from the works continue to be made on a large scale.     The forward purchases are small, and the demand for this season is beginning to decline. Superphosphate - The vital question is the future supply of rock phosphate to enable all the acid now available to be used.
Sufficient quantities are in stock to meet requirements for the next two months, but the imports in the first three months of this year have only been one-third of the minimum quantity required, and the scarcity of tonnage makes importation very difficult.improved, and manufacturers are being urged to deliver promptly. A circular has been sent out enquiring whether additional trucks are vr anted.Basic Slag - The manufacturers of basic slag are -being asked to fix the prices for the coming season on the basis of 1918,  and also to provide in their contracts with dealers for resale at an agreed price.Seed Corn - As a result of a deputation received from the National British and Irish Corn Trade Association, representations have been made to the Food Controller, who has amended his recent Order fixing maximum prices for heme-grown cereals so as toexclude seed corn.Seed Potatoes - Supplies from Ireland have come forward satis-factorily during the week, snd the last shipment, making a total of 8,500 tons from this source, is now being loaded, Distribu-tion to Agricultural Executive Committees is nearing completion, and it will also be possible to supply a certain number cf other applicants with seed.The supply of superphosphate for this year&apos;s crops hasSeeds Section.I am,Sir,Tour obedient Servant,Director-General.Rt.
