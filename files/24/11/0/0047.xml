E C R E T.--- WAR &apos; CABINET.O.T. 547.NOTE BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL   GENERAL STAFFONCOUNT HORODYSiXT &apos; S MEMORANDUM..No one will be disposed to disagree with Count HorodysldJs views as to the situation in Russia, the wisdom-of not counting on her for any sustained effort, and the desirability of devising some scheme, if possible, for preventing her disappearance from the war.    In principle, his proposal that troops should be sent from the United States to Russia deserves consideration.    Their presence might prove a stimulus to the Russians, and afford grounds for the taking over by the Americans of the transport and supply services which are now one of the chief causes cf the inefficiency of the Russian Armies.     Count Horodyski however, does not seem to appreciate the time that will be required by the United States to create new military forces.     He speaks of the 500,000 men sent to Russia as a small force, &quot;which would not interfere with the subsequent despatch of a larger force to France.   Further, it is more than doubtful if, in view of the length of the comriunications by sea and rail (about a fortnight in each case), a force of anything like-as-many as 500,000 could be maintained, to say nothing of so many being needed.     Four to six divisions would be a more practicable suggestion, and should be sufficient for the purpose indicated.     It is probable that if they were drawn from the Western States of America they wo:ld not materially diminish the numbers available for despatch to the Western Front.     Once the Russian railways were placed in reasonable working order ample supplies of food and forage could be obtained locally both for the Russian and American troops, while the absence of enemy craft from the raclfic Ocean would render the communications much safer than those across the Atlantic.On the whole it is considered that a suggestion on the above lines might be put before the United StatesGovernment.   It is, of course, not possible to say now -some 6 months ahead - -whether the divisions could orshould actually be sent,   but the knowledge that theirdospatch was under coneideration might have the effect,in the meantime of stiffening the Russians, and induce them to get their own house in order. .(sgd.)
