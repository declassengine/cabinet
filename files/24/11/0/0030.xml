Prench are ? providing an additional 4 gun battery of 120 m.m. short guns per division.Prench cannot supply 155 m.m. howitzers and 88   6H howitzers.&quot;Howitzers have been asked for in England, but in point of fact 60 would be sufficient. Batteries of 53 m.m. guns are complete and on the front.Trench mortar batteries will be sent to the front but are still at instruction schools.
From:     Colonel Thomson, Roumania. To    :     D.M.I..   April 20th, 1917.C.B.519.   Part 2. Continuation.There are no corps troops, and in fact, corps organi-sation Is only for administrative purposes.Army troops consist of1. Cavalry Brigade of 2 Regiments (6 squadrons) each Regiment having 4 French machine guns.Following is artillery reserve parks of 2nd Army,exclusive of divisional artillery:-8 Guns of 105 millimetre (1891 model, long). - 4 Mountain Guns 63 millimetre.16 Guns of 120 Millimetre, long.4 Howitzers 150 millimetre quick-firing guns.Above have, as yet, no special organisation, and are distributed along the front.Aviation Service.     With the 2nd Army there are 3 squadrons aeroplanes, viz. 1 squadron of 6 semi Nieuport (?*s for) reconnaissance;   1 squadron of 6 Farmans (mark 2), for co-operation with artillery and for photographic workj 1 squadron 4 Farman. )Mark 6) battle planes.Are now in course of formation: 4 regiments heavy artillery, which will be at the disposal of G.H.Q..   Each regi-ment will eventually consist:- 6 (4 guns) batteries of 120 millimetre, long French guns.2 (4 gun) batteries of 155 millimetre guns. ,   A demand for 6-in. guns has been submitted to His Majestyfs Government, as the French Government cannot supply 155 millimetre guns.   I have expressed the opinion that a gun of this calibre (even of the most modern design) is too heavy for the road bridges in this theatre, and I have not held out any hopes of their being forthcoming.   In addition to above, there are 2
batteries 150 millimetre howitzers, quick-firing, Schneider.As regards personnel and bullock teams, the 4 regiments heavy artillery and the 2 batteries 150 millimetre, quick-firing, howitzers,.are already complete.   There remain 16 batteries of heavy artillery, whose personnel is complete, but for which transport is (1 Group omitted)ing.   These batter-ies consisting of guns, old pattern, with calibres varying from 150 millimetre to 120 millimetre.The 1st Roumanian Army (now being re-organised by the French Mission). will consist of the 1st, 3rd and 5th Army Corps, each 3 Divisions, and will be commanded by Qeneral PREZAN.     The divisional organisation and Army troops will be as in 2nd Army under General PREZAN.     The rank and file of the 1st Army should give a good account of themselves.   They are men from WALLACHIA; their attitude is revengeful, and most satisfactory.To provide the personnel for all units mentioned (2 Groups) and for reserves to replace loss, there are suffi-cient men of military age available.     Perhaps the organisation is based on a too optimistic view of what it is possible to supply in guns and war material generally, and in point of fact the enemy Ottoman front is no better equipped with Artill-ery than the Roumanian divisions now opposed to them.   However, there are many obstacles to an offensive on this front at any time during next 3 months, apart from the question of artillery &quot;&apos; .G. Communications are defective, local (?supplies) are being consumed by Russian troops (Reference to my cipher telegram No.CB.486, on March 31st), and 36,000 horses are required for two cavalry divisions (now in Russia), for transport services generally and for the artillery of the 1st Army .
It is considered by General PREZAN, who takes an optimistic view of the situation, that he aan undertake an expedition next June or July.     If a radical change were made in Russian methods in this theatre, such an operation might be possible, but the change must be complete and immediate.    Part 3 message follows.        Part 2 message ends.
Prom:      Colonel Thompson. To: D.M.I.20th April, 1917.G.B. 519.   Part 3.I have not included 32   5M Howitzers ceded to Roumania by Russia in artillery armament (reference my C.B. 406 March 28th and War Office 32262 of April 7th). These should arrive shortly.Both Minister of War and French Mission express surprise that no answer has been received yet in regard to howitzers and guns (4.5M and 6&quot; Howitzers and 6n guns) which we alone can supply and which are shown in the list of Roumanian requirements prepared by French Mission. Minister of War tells me that in order of importance Artillery armament comes first, and he would be glad to postpone despatch of other War material now being sent to Roumania in order to obtain his modern guns and, howitzers at the earliest possible date.     I have repeatedly informed Minister of War that we have not as yet promised to send anything in the way of heavy artillery but am inclined to think French Mission has committed themselves by giving impression that we would fall in with any reoommendations made through Paris.     I should be glad to know whether I can hold out any hopes to Roumanian Government that even-tually this demand can be met by us, and, if so, telren. and to what extent.
