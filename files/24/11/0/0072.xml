Intellige&amp;cs.From i Colonel Blair.TO25-4-m?.1068.   I was informed to-day by a member of the Duma who has just returned from the Western front, that in his opinion, with the prevailing lack of discipline, the Russians cannot in the event of an attack, maintain the line they now hold. He stated that there was continual intercourse between the opposing lines, and that Russian soldiers went over to the German I lines with their regimental numbers on their shoulder straps, While German soldiers always removed their should r straps, prior to coming over.     He is afraid that Russian soldier is so ignorant that in conversation he gives a?*ay all Russian dls-posltions.   He added that no firing was going on, nor was there any aerial reconnaissance.Several more marching companies have left Petrograd for the front. ,Copies to   M.I..1. only.
