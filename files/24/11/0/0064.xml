SJS C R B T. G.T. 564.WAR CABINET.From G.O.C in CSalonikaTo.   D.M.I. 25th April,  1917.1.991. 24th.Following summary report on the Royalist Forces drawn up by French Headquarters.1.        Regular troops Thessaly :    In accordance with promises of Greek Government admitted that Regiments of 1st Division now reduced to. 640 men each, with no other rifles than those actually carried hy men and without machine guns: officers, however,  46 per Regiment and number of cartridges belonging the Regiments reported passed Corinth control less usual allowance for Regiments on War footing.2.        Gendarmerie :    Total number of gendarmes and police in Thessaly reasonably estimated 1,500, according to agreement maximum number to be maintained north of canal being 3,000.3.        Other elements :    Number officers and men on leave undetermined, but doubt expressed as to number of reservists who might respond to call of their Committees when question is not one of pillage and shouting but fighting.4. Irregulars :    Owing to police operations south ofneutral zone Comitajis have lost their field of action; greater part have gone further south, but numbers previously exaggerated and to-day they should be reckoned by hundreds only.    Italian advance in Epirus having &quot;considerable effect and men generally influenced by vigorous (?) recent repressions have lost much of their enthusiasm.5.        Arms :   Arms issued to reservists in some regions have been definitely recalled and existence of secret depots has never been positively, proved.   As is custom in Balkan localities large
number of Gras rifles and carbines however are scattered ahout amonst inhabitants.   Somewhat iarge stocks of these were discovered in Kipurjos region, hut any such stores now existing have heen sent South.6. Spirit of population :    All have suffered from scarcityof supplies.   As they are afraid of mobilisation population does not want Venizelist (one group) in Thessaly, hut probably mobili-sation would be considered a lesser evil than prolongation of present suffering.7. Conclusions :    Thessaly 1,920 Regular soldiers,  1,500gendarmes,  some deserters and men on leave, uncertain number of reservists,  less than 1,000 irregulars; but it appears doubtful whether all these latter supplementary troops would respond if ailed upon.   Men are weak in health, poorly equipped, badly clothed supply of ammunition limited, food supply precarious.    If Corinth Bridge occupied reinforcements for Thessally troops can only arrive from Epirus or Attica.   Epirus 1,920 regular soldiers, Attica ditto,  regular Infantry with 480 cavalry.    1,500 gendarmes distri-buted through whole of central Greece.    All machine guns and artillery transferred to Peloponnese.   As communications difficult little consideration need be given to possibility of reinforcement of troops in Thessally.   Only reinforcement possibly to he feared but which will be limited by arms at its disposal would be constituted by soldiers 1914 class who are returning to Attica and may move to Thessally.Copies to M.I.1.
