IMPERIAL WAR CABINET.(Hote by the Colonial Office).1.    The annexed maps show by red lines the provisional division of the Camerootts made in February-April 1916 with the French Government,2.     The reasons why (if it is possible) it is very desirable that Duala and the surrounding country (including the Duala Jabassi and Bare Districts) should be British after the war are given in paragraph 55 of printed memorandum annexed.   They may bo summarized thus:-y\(1)     The capture of Duala was affected by British forces and it was occupied by our forces for 17 months.   Our prestige must have suffered by our withdrawal.(2)     Retention of Duala was strongly urged by the General Officer Commanding (Sir C.Dobell) the Senior Naval Officer (Oaptain Puller, R.N*) and Sir P.Lugard on strategical grounds. Duala is the best port on that coast, either for a minor naval base, a coaling station or a harbour of refuge.   It could easily be made almost impregnable (German plans for doing so were found there) and its possession by Prance would the Admiralty state, put us in a very disadvantageous position in West Africa in the event of a war with Prance. Captain Puller said &quot;If our Government does not take Duala and the northern half, they will make a grave error which they will be made to pay for in years to come&quot;.3.   -Duala is by far&apos; the&apos; best commercial port in the Cameroons,   British firms (John Bolt and&apos; Company (Liverpool) Limited, and W.D.Woodin and Company of Liverpool and R. and W. King and Company of Bristol etc.) did a considerable trade there before the war.   The French had practically no commercial interests there.4.     If as -a  result of the action of His Majesty*s Government in February-April, 1916, and partition arrangements in other parts of the world His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot obtain Duala and the surrounding districts, or any considerably larger share of the Cameroons than is at present administered by us (and always assuming that the Germans are given back none of the Cameroons) then the minor adjustments of the present Anglo-French boundary in the Cameroons which are very desirable are shewn (Approximately) by the blue lines and colt-uration on the annexed map marked D., ,The reasons for desiring these modifications (proceeding from north to south) are:-(1)     To obtain the Mandara Emirate which is closely connected with Bornu.(2)     To give us the Mandara mountains as a natural barrier over a considerable distance between us and the French.CAMEROONS.
(3)     To give us the western valleys of the Mandara mountains, the country round Garua, and the rest of the Emirates of Kontscha Laro and Dodoall of which were formerly under the Emir of Yola and were reft from his dominions when the Anglo-German division was made.(4)     To give us the remainder of the old Dachang District fi.e. the present Dachang District less the South and  outh-east parts) and thus prevent numerous tribes being split, up between the British and French as at present by the provisional line drawn straight across this district.(5)     To secure a more satisfactory frontier in the extreme south-east corner of the Victoria District by taking the line of the. Mungo River.5*     It may be added that before the war, both Nigeria and the Gold Coast had as neighboursOn the West and North - the FrenchOn the East - the Germans.Thus we never had to guard against attack on morem than two frontiers at once and (as attack from the north was not likely to be very formidable) practically we had only to guard against- attack on one frontier at a time, the east or the west.But if Germany goes from West ifrica, both Nigeria and Togoland will have French territory on three sides; and In the event of war with France In the future, wo shall be in a less favourable position than before.   It is therefore desirable that our new Eastern frontier of the Cameroons should be as far as possible natural frontiers and contain in the British sphere, in order to servj   as a barrier to the French, as much of the mountainous country (shewn :ed E. in contoured map herewith) as is practicable.
