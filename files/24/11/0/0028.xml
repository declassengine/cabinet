/2[lb.War Cabinet.Assistance to Norway in the matter of aerial defenceMemorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I circulate with reference to War Cabinet 119(21), the subjoined note by the Director General of Military Aeronautics; The possibilities of giving assistance to Norway inthe matter of defence against air raids opens some very difficult questions.     We could spare for Norway the necessary aeroplanes, but it would be very undesirable to let them have our appliances for destroying Zeppelins, as I fear there would be every prospect of the details of these appliances being known in Berlin very shortly after they were given.     I would be willing to send sufficient personnel to carry out the defensive work with no assistance from the Norwegians, but this, of course could not be done without giving the Germans an immediate casus belli, against Norway.It is a little difficult to understand the Norwegian fear of air raids as a reprisal for their giving us shipping facilities, unless the Norv/egians consider that any favour to us shown in the matter of shipping will in itself cause war between Norway and Germany.     Therefore it seems that the main difficulty would be to get our men to Norway after a declaration of war or the beginning of hostilities, and yet in time to deal with air raids.     If Norv/ay desires to wait until definite military action is taken against her by Germany, before giving any good excuse for hostilities, then I suggest the following method :-We could   send a flight of aeroplanes suited for, but not fitted for night flying, immediately, and we could have packed up ready for immediate shipment the necessary appliances for night flying, and for the attack of Zeopelins,     An officer in plain clothes could leave as soon as required, to arrange for aerodromes and search-light stations, which would take a little time to Then when Norway is ready, the personnel of could be despatched at short notice to take aeroplanes and work of defence.prepare, the flight over theIf this proposal should be approved by the Norwegian Government, ?7e can take action immediately.     The personnel and material provided for Norway would have to be temporarily withdrawn from Home Defence Stations in this country.DERBY.The War Office,23rd April, 1917.
