(j.T.553.WAR   CABINET.OBSERVATIONS-OF THEMEDICAL RESEARCH COMMITTEEmade at the request of the Prime Minister upon1.A Memorandum by Sir Almroth Wright.11.Other questions relating to theArmy Medical Department.3rd. February, 1917.I.   A Memorandum by Sir Almroth Wright.The Committee desire in the first instance to remark that they were unaware of the existence of Sir Almroth fright-&apos;s Memorandum until after it had been submitted by him to certain authorities, and were not acquainted with the contents before receiving the copy sent by the Prime Minister&quot;.It is to be noticed that Sir Almroth Wright approves the technical machinery of the R.A.M.C administration in Prance, but disparages its efficiency in securing proper methods and results in professional surgical treatment.In general, however, the administrative machinery, which he praises, is guided by the regular officers of the R.A.M.C., while the methods of professional treatment, ffhich he attacks, are left very largely in the hands of civilian practitioners recruited to the R.A.M.C., and are guided in the main by advice tendered to Headquarters by temporarily commissioned Consultants, of whom Sir Almroth Aright is one.Blame for the.inadequacy, or faulty direction, or professional treatment as such, falls therefore primarily upon the Consultants as a body, and not upon the Director-General in France and his Staff, who, as is well known, have freely sought and accepted both initiative and criticism from the Consultant body for the proper guidance of the executive in relation to treatment of cases.Upon the bearings of military exigencies upon the Policy of hospital evacuation the Committee do,not feel competent to express an opinion.
The main conclusion reached by Sir Almroth bright is that an improved Medical Intelligence and Investigation Department is required for the better guidance of the Army Medical Administration.Representatives of the Committee had previously had informal&quot; discussion with the Director-General of questions closely allied to this, and in Part II of the present Memorandum it will be seen that the Committee themselves $alee proposals analogous to those of Sir itlmroth Uright but ?-ith a view to the central administration in Fhiteh&amp;ll, and with special regard to the needs of the United Kingdom and of the Mediterranean areas rather than to these cf the forces in France. Nevertheless they regard Sir Almroth bright1s Memorandum, which is based chiefly on his local experience in France, as faulty both in tone ana per-spective, and for the following reasons.1.   Re rests his case mainly upon the present imperfections of the treatment of infected wounds.    This, however important, is a special case.   The administrative staff is well known to be ready to accept further guidance in this matter, from scientific opinion, but opinion is still divided - or has been until quite lately - upon the familiar but very difficult problems involved.2.   Re omits reference to the ready applications of scientific knowledge made already by the Service in other directions -in triple typhoid inoculation, prophylaxus against tetanus, etc.,- or to their brilliant results.3.   There is a scientific advisory and Intelligence system already in existence in France.   Colonel Sir William Leishman, C.B., F.R.S., was specially appointed to be adviser in Pathology to the British Expeditionary Force, and is responsible for the organisation of scientific investigation and intelligence for the guidance of the Director-General.   On the  &apos;Intelligence&apos; side, moreover, Sir Arthur Sloggeti in 1915 detailed Major T.R.Elliott, F.R.3., R.A.M.C., for the work of representing the Committee in France in relation to the system of Statistical records, with which the Committee are entrusted by the Army Council, and for the supervision of certain nevv methods for the interchange of information.    The Committee will refer again below to this advisory system and its eossible development elsewhere.4,   Sir Almroth Wright1s remarks refer throughout to France. But the Committee believe that it is the conditions in the United Kingdom and in the Mediterranean Areas which most need critical attention In present circumstances, and that it is these rather than these in France which will derive the fullest benefit from administrative chaner.es at the centre of all of them in the War Office itself.
11.    Sug ge st io n s jf q r iu t ill s in g jzi ore fully scionti -fic knb^Ic*dge-mand civilian personnel. with a. vies to^^liu^ improvement^ of treatment, accolerat ioof-recevery, and further pre-vonIIoh &quot;of &quot;disease.Turning from the particular and localised questions which have &quot;been raised with regard to the AeM.Ss in France, the Committee now submit, as requested hy the Prime Minister, some &quot;broader considerations upon the organisation of the Army Medical Department,, not only as centred in Whitehall, hut in all the areas of its activity.(A).    The utiljsation of scientific knowledge.The Committee &quot;believe that the utilisation of scien-tific knowledge hy the Army Medical Service as a whole might he improved in some important respects.They desire at the outset to express as clearly as possible their conviction that the fullest welcome has always been in their experience extended by the Army Medical Department to responsible scientific help from out-side.      In very many directions throughout tho war tho Committee have offered advice for thy use of the Director-General, eidler at his roouest or upon their own initiative, They cannot recall a si^J    instance in which scientific advice so offered has :oA3 hewn received with cordiality a^d readily appreciated hy Sir Alfred Zecgh. and hardly a single instance in which advice of this kind, whether invi-ted by him or not, has not &quot;been adopted immediately with a view to action &quot;based, on it.The Committee desire particularly to lay stress upon this personal question.     They recognise that they owe a heavy debt to Sir Alfred Keogh for the innumerable oppor-tunities he has given them for offering services and for tendering scientific advice.In the opinion of the Committee, scientific help when tendered to the Army Medical Department, generously received and adopted,  sometime^ fails nevertheless to hear full fruit on account of defects upon the executive side. These are shown either in the detail or method of the action taken hy particular Departments, or in particular features within the areas outside to folio?; effectively the orders given from Whitehall,The/
The Committee think it unnecessary now to give examplea from their experience to illustrate this point, but they would be ready to do so in detail if it be thought useful.Reference to some general principles, which will be accepted they think without discussion, will show clearly what they have in mind.(1) Expert scientific knowledge should be available with-in the Department itself to secure (a), proper initiative and lb) the adequate design and the proper detailed&quot;exe-cution of administrative action.This is almost a truism;   yet it is the case that through-out the war there has been no expert pathologist within the walls of the War Office either to supply initiative, or to be in touch with details of administra-tive orders depending on expert knowledge.     Colonel Horrocks of course has highly expert knowledge in parti-cular directions, but his time has always been most fully occupied with special problems in sanitation and in defensive work against poison gas.     The absence of an expert pathologist became especially serious when in addition to the we11-organised force in France, forces became engaged in sub-tropical regions in the IDast, and when the results of defective preventive work in the East appeared in great numbers for treatment at home.The Committee have been permitted on many occasions to give or collect advice for the help of the Department. But advice from outside, without initiative based on expert knowledge within, is often sought too late.   The Committee have sometimes been asked for scientific assis-tance which could have been given more usefully at an earlier stage.     The full value moreover of scientific advice will never be secured unless persons with expert knowledge are in effective touch with the small but vital details of administration, and can be cognisant not only with the execution locally of orders given, but also of the detailed results obtained.hereThe Committee venture to submit that  there is a clear case for change.     The change they would suggest is indeed no change in theory but only one in practice. Early in 1915 Sir 7/illiara Leishman, C.3. , F.R.S., then with the British Expeditionary Force in France, was appointed adviser in Pathology to the Force by Sir ArthurSloggett/
Sloggett,     He was previously the expert in Pathology posted to the Amy Medical Advisory Board in the War Office.Though no doubt Prance must remain the first mili-tary theatre, there seems to he a double reason for urging that the chief Adviser in Pathology should he seated centrally at the War Office,     The arrangements in France are now well-organised, and hy this time it must he possible for others to continue on existing lines Sir William Leishman1e work there.     France moreover is only a few hours from Whitehall,    But, secondly, the best interests of the Forces in France are not necessarily best studied there.      Central directions from London alone can secure for instance that the forces in France shall he protected from danger coming with diseases from the Mediterranean hy fitting precautions taken in the United Kingdom,,     Again while the local problems in France have immense importance from the numbers of the troops engaged, they are simpler in kind than the problems pre-sented in the Eastern areas with sub-tropical climates and their sx^eoial dangers.The Committee suggest accordingly that Sir William Leishman he brought home to act at the centre in his present capacity as Adviser, or Director, in Pathology to the Director-General,     Ee should have the ste,tus of Assistant Director-General, with a suitable staff, of which local representatives should-have duties in France and in the  astern theatres, similar to those he has had with the British Expeditionary Force.It will he seen that this is nearly equivalent to Sir Almroth Wright&apos;s chief proposal, hut it is placed on a wider basis, and does not involve the transference of Sir AJmroth Wiight from his laboratory work to administra-tive duties.The Committee will refer again below to the fresh arrangement hers suggested, and will point to some impor-tant future advantages which they believe it would secure for the Army Medical Department.   .(2) The second general principle the Committee would lay down as essential for the proper utilisation of scientific advice is that, given the advice, the executive Departments must he. adequate hoth centrally and per:ipherally to give it rapidj^oAfull effect,    The Committee think that important improvement might, he secured here,(a)   As to the central Departments at the War Office, the Committee have formed the opinion that while the officers in charge of these have worked - if they may say so - with untiring zeal under conditions of continual difficulty and pressure, these conditions have been unnecessarily difficulThe/
The immense expansion of the military effort of the nation has been reflected among other branches of the War Office work (including Munitions Supply)  in a corresponding expansion of office accommodation and personnel.     !But there does not appear to nave been any proportionate expansion of the Army Medical Departments,Prom A.L.D.2 for example. Lieut-Colonel Earrow formerly, and later Lieut-Colonel Webb, have had to handle questions of the orgainsation of hospitals and comyiunica-tions, involving very large financial and scientific interests, which elsewhere would be considered to demand many times the present assistant and clerical staff available, and many times the present office accommodation. In this matter there appears to have been no conspicuous change in office arrangements following upon the succes-sive expansions throughout the war in the number, size and intricacy of the problems to be solved, as new areas with their special medical difficulties have come into importance,(b)   As to the executive efficency in local areas outside, the Committee will point in the next section to the diffi-culties necessarily found in maintaining fully adequate executive in- the United Kingdom and the Eastern areas relatively to that of France,(3)   For any successful executive action, lastly, j^ie^ex-ecutiye centre,must be kept informed (and in the present connexion the scientific advisers must be kept informed) not only of (a) the^j.vay JLn^whJLj^J^ and localthe resjqlts^ immediate and later.^ pf the action taken.In the opinion of the Committee these conditions are not sufficiently provided for in till ($nexpanded Army Medi-cal Departments,   So f-\r as the Committee can judge, there is no well-developed system of ]^ ^Gtijynby which the cen-tral authority can be kept in immediate acquaintance with the methods and results of the outlying local centres.This deficiency, if it be- admitted, calls in any case for remedy, but in present conditions a remedy is required with special urgency.   For it has to be remembered that the Force in France represents wh*t was, to speak rough-.&quot; . the whole establishment,   .nd naturally absorbed at the beginning the great majority of the best available -egu*ar &apos; officers.    It is a matter of co:.r.on kno^led^e, inevitable and no source of reproach in any way, that tne I).Tjs.H.S.
and other important officers now used at home or in other areas are not all of adequate efficiency.     Many of them had previously retired and are necessarily out of touch with the modern developments of medical science and administration.It is known moreover that the Commanding Officers even of important Military or Territorial,hospitals cannot all he depended upon to appreciate the full significance of orders with regard to necessary pathological work, or to the keeping of proper medical records, and carry them out intelligently.     Many of these officers were ordinary practitioners before the war and could not he expected either to he abreast of the latest knowledge in the new and growing branches of medical science or to appreciate the full importance of accurate records and returns.     When the Committee were empowered hy the Army Council in the early months of the war to deal directly with these -commanding Officers with a view to aiding the provision of laboratories and pathological work, they found more than one who openly professed complete unconcern whether his hospital had any laboratory or pathological assistants at all.     This state of affairs was almost inevitable and must not be made the ground of complaint.     But it must be recognised, and the Committee mention it as showing the need for closer central supervision by an improved system of inspection from the War Office.To prove that it is no academical pcint which is here being made, hut one of the first importance not only to the Medical Department but to the successful conduct cf the war, a single instance may he given.Thousands of dysentery cases and convalescents returned to this country from the Mediterranean, and apart altogether from questions of their medical treatment, it was a matter of the moat extreme importance to our military prospects in Trance that no fresh infections should he introduced there. The recognition of dysenteric infections turns almost wholly upon laboratory examinations.     Carriers of infection can be recognised in no other way.     Parsing over the earlier history of this problem, to the solution of which the Committee had given a good deal of help,, an Army Council Instruction was issued last Autumn hy which it was laid down that for all convalescents the final examination showing freedom from infection was to he made at a particular hospital.     This was to he the last harrier to he passed before the possible carrier could he released for duty elsewhere as free from danger to others.     The laboratory, however, in which this work, for cases coming from all over the Kingdom, was to he done, contained only one bacteriologist who could hy no possibility of exertion cope with the work, and who was moreover not trained at all, or competent, to do the extremely important side of the work relating to Amoebic, as opposed to Bacillary, dysentery.When the Committee became aware indirectly that these were the conditions, they arranged for additional help to this Laboratory at a day1s notice.     The relevent point here is that, eb. far as they could ascertain, neither the
it i 38.the Commanding Officer on the spot, nor the D.D.M.S.of the Command, on whom the War Office depended, appreciated the situation sufficiently to realise that in the actual condi-tions the Army Council Instruction must he ineffective,and to make a report to the War Office to that effect.A system of organised inspection or &quot;intelligence&quot; such as the Committee now propose would introduce no new princi-ple.   Already, in consequence of representations from the Committee, the Director-General has sent Inspectors to super-vise the introduction of a general modification in the system of hospital records, and more recently on the same suggestion he has secured an inspection hy a special officer sent from London of all the laboratories dealing with dysenteric infections.   Both these instances of inspection brought immediate good results in the revelation of local&quot; defects and their rapid removal,and the system so begun might he developed further.The Committee urge further that special officers should have under their charge particular questions in which ad-ministrative details must have close relation to scientific knowledge.     This has &quot;been done already with success in relation to neurological treatment at various centres.    In the special case again of cerebro-spinal fever the Committee have supplied and paid for the special staff which has successfully organised all the military work in this direction for two years.   But the problem of this disease in its relation to the economy of man-power is far less in import-ance or extent than the problems of Mediterranean Dysentery have been, and probably no more important than the more recent problems presented by the treatment of Malaria cases in this country hy practitioners unfamiliar with it.The Committee suggest accordingly that special officers acting for the proper executive Department but also in riela-tion to the Adviser in Pathofogy and his staff,  should supervise the co-ordination of the work done at all centres in the country in certain selected groups cf problems.The Committee have not referred in any detail to the very grave problems in the Mediterranean area,   They believe that their proper solution would he greatly aided hy the adoption of the proposals already made above, and for that reason do not ente^l-p into further detail-led discussion of them here.     They need not point to the immense national importance of successful medical admlaistration in those dangerous areas.The Committee think that most important questions of man-power, as well as of finance, will he closely affected hy an improvement in the supervision of the work done in the local units of the several Commands by an improved system of Inspection from the Central Departments.The Committee have the highest admiration for the good work being done in military hospitals all over the country, but they think that a better supervision of the treatment of particular groups of cases, and more especially supervision of the treatment in convalescent hospitals would result in the earlier return to duty of very large numbers of men.
The Committee have had reason to represent that in many Convalescent and V.A.I).hospitals men sometimes linger for weeks or months on account of a discharging sinus after the nearly complete healing of a wound. Conditions vary widely in different parts of the country; in some places the treatment of convalescent soldiers with sinuses is&quot;left largely to the nurse in charge,with supervision byua practitioner unfamiliar with the host methods of wound treatment.     The appointment of consult-ant surgeons to the Commands has not sufficed to carry energetic and modern treatment into the smaller rani-fications of the hosfpital system.Other groups of cases should also be mentioned. Large numbers of amoebic dysentery carriers have been held back from duty by imperfect laboratory arrangements in the Commands, while malaria cases in many districts are under practitioners inexperienced in the necessary treatment.     The establishment of a special hospital for heart cases at Hampstead revealed immediately trie exist-ence of numerous heart cases which had remained un-necessarily in hospital, of which some could be immediately invalided from the service, while others again in proper hands, could be returned to duty after appropriate exercises.   Instances of similar kinds in connection with scabies and other diseases could be given.The Committee give these instances only as illus-trations to .convey their meaning.     They are aware that in seme of the very directions they mention action has already been taken to put better knowledge at the service of local medical officers, and good results have already been obtained in the earlier return to duty of many classes of patients; but they urge that these successes have been in large degree partial and local and that a mure complete system of inspection from the centre would have import-ant results in conserving man-power, saving money, and hastening individual recovery.(B) The utilisation of Civilian Personnel.The Committee do not consider that they have special experience which qualifies them to enter at all fully here into the very large questions affecting the proper utilisation of the strength of the Medical prof-ession for Army Medical purposes.     Their work has brought them into direct relation less to the employment of medical and surgical practitioners than to the utilisation of Pathological and other scientific workers.The Committee can probably serve best by mentioning the two chief directions in ?/hich they have become aware of a widely-spread feeling of grievance.
%. As is well known, complaints are commonly heard that men taken from most, important professional work at home are sent to military duty and find themselves occupied only for a fraction of each day. These complaints come especially, but not exclusively, from tho Mediterranean areas.Again,- the Committee recognise fully tint complaints of this kind are to some degree inevitable,and especially so in military affairs where,at all costs, maximum provision must be made for possible military needs.     Many of t e corn-plaints are obviously due to an imperfedt understanding of this elementary military principle.At the same time, the Committee believe that a case can be made o-i2t for a complete reconsideration of the routine calculations for staffing hospitals and other units.    They think that the estimates for staff adopted by t3ie R.A.M.C before the war have been adhered to without thorough considers tion in the light of the changed conditions,of the enormous expansion of forces.and of the possibilities of economy of staff by specialisation of function.     The recent immense growth in importance of Pathological work has also,they xh&amp;nk, not been sufficiently recognised, with the result that patholegists are commonly overworked,with loss of efficiency in the treatment which depends on their work,while clinical medical officers meanwhile have their time net fully occup-ied.With regard to Pathological personnel.the Committee believe that economy could be effected by better organisation of laboratories in the various Commands at home.    It has already been pointed out that the D.D&amp;.LuS0 at present avail-able for work at home, and officers under them,are not always familiar with the modern uses and importance of laboratories. In one Comuand, great improvements were introduced in the laboratory organisation by the employment of a pathological professor who carried out an inspection and made suggestions for re-organisation    Such a pl.?n might be developed in other Commands, either locally or through Inspection effected from the War Office,as already suggested.1. Very numerous complaints have been heard,as is well known that men of special qualities have not been assigned to the most suitable work.     Complaints of this kind are of course inevitable under any system, however perfect,but the committee think that some justification can be found for them.     The problems faced by A,hi.D.1 has been that of utilising in the most effective way medical men of every kind, specialists in all the branches of medicine and sur-gery and Pathologists in every variety.    This problem could not be solved satisfactorily by any one man,and since the head of the Department must necessarily seek, advice, there should never be ground for supposing that advice is sought without a particular system or from individuals not   fully responsible,.     The Committee think, that where such large national interests are affected, an where the intricacies of a great civil,profession have to be studied, the Army Medical Department. chiefly concerned should have been strengthened and might still be strengthened by responsible specialist advice representative of the chief professional branches.&apos;
SUMMARY.The practical suggestions the Committee have made may he summarised as follows:A,Utilisation of scientific knowledge.(l) The centralisation in the War Office itself of the scientific advisory staff of the A. M. S.In detail it is suggested that Colonel Sir William Leishman he recalled from France to act (as at present in France) as chief Adviser, or Director, in Pathology (Colonel Horrocks to act a3 Director in Sanitation- in the War Office as at present).(2) The enlargement in office staff and accommo-dation of the present Army Medical Departments, in accord-ance with their separate requirements.(3) The further development of a system of Inspection from the War Office for better control (a) of local executive work and its results, and (h) of parti-cular problems of medical administration which are not adapted for special treatment hy Commands or Districts.B*. Utilisation of Civilian personnel.(l) Strengthening of A.M.D.1 hy a recognised and open use of responsible skilled advice.(2) Reconsideration of the oasis of calculations for staffing needs.(3) Revised co-ordination of laboratories as to distribution and equipment, with a view to economy of work and personnel.GENERAL CONCLUSION.The Committee venture to urge that the suggestions made above represent the minimum changes which appear to them immediately necessary.     In putting them forward,they desire, however, to show the relation of these changes to others which in their opinion would both aid in the successful prosecution of the war and at the same time improve the future work and aid the best development of the Army Medical Service.The Committee are convinced that the present time of war is the best opportunity for making these changes, if these hring no dislocation of present work.     If introduced now, they will he in full working order when peace comes to the? combatants and the preventive war against disease has to he maintained.     If postponed till after peace, proposals will have to face long delay due to the need which will be felt for reaction and rest, and in delay the lessons of the war will tend to &quot;be forgotten.
They desire to urge that the Army Medical Department is of all others in the Var Office a Department which should remain always at war, even when military peace has come.    In peace time it must always remain actively mobilised as to its scientific departments, if military preventive medicine is to prosper and grow,     Enquiries into sanitation, diet, and the physiology of fatigue, with laboratory researches into disease and its prevention, must go on actively at home, while abroad all over the Empire special researches must he conducted and medical surveys made of every important terrain.The Medical Research Committee represents a State De-% partment for similar woric in civilian interests, and they have common national interests with the Army Medical Depart-ment in advancing Preventive Med.io.ine in the widest sense. Both must preserve the fullest independence, yet each should look to the other for co-operation and help.     The Medical Research Committee believe that it is in the vital interests of their own future work that the Army Medical Department should be strong and in the fullest activity.     Experience in America and Germany has shown what valuable fields for research a strong Army Medical Service can provide, and the present war has proved this to he true for Great Britain,if further proof were needed.The Committee beg leave accordingly to submit for immediate consideration the following outlines for the better organisation of the primary preventive work of the Army Medical Service.1*    Position of Director-General. A. M, S.In the French Army the Director-General,A.M.S. has the position of Under-Seoretary of State; in the United States he (General Gorges) is directly responsible to the Secretary of State, and his position is reflected in both countries in the strength and responsibility of the A.rmy Medical Department under him.    In no progressive military system out of England is the D.G.,A.Lu8. a subordinate officer under the Adjutant-General, ranking with (eg,) the , Chaplain-General, as, if questions of personnel only wc*e his main concern.The Committee think that there is a strong balance of argument from a purely military point of view for piecing immediately the man properly responsible for the health and physical training of all forces, their freedom from disease in the field, and. their treatment after wounds or disease, upon the Army Council, equally with the Meads of the Departments responsible for Stores, Ordnance.Aeronautics, and so on.      The absence of the ,A,M,S.,  from the Councilmay be held contributory to failures like these of the Ambulance Service in the Mons retreat and of the Dardanelles and Salonika expeditions for effective preventive measures based on foresight,  the D,G.,A.M.S., must have equal o-ppor-tunities with the Heads of other -great Departments for know-ing and discussing plans beforehand.     At present the        , A.M.S., must ordinarily represent his views through a laymen, who may not interpret them effectively in discussion.   He
is.  218He has also to take orders in theory, and eften in practice, from the Adjutant-General.The Committee would agree that a we*$c D.G.,A.M.S.would be better represented on the Army Ctuncil by a strong Adjut-ant General. That there never should be a weak Director-General, and promotion to that position should invariably be by merit and not by seniority.   The present seems a particularly op.;,or-tune moment for the change,for Sir Alfred ICeogh is available for replacement to a position of direct access to the Secretary of State equivalent to that he had formerly.    In his hands any consequent changes in detail could be effectively made and the close of the war must show the man best fitted to succeed him,2. Scientific organisation of Army Medical Servijqe.The Committee have indicated already the suggestions they would make for immediate changes in matters of scientific organ-isation. In order to show that these changes,which as they believe could be readily introduced at once,might lead without ineon-venience to the establishment they would wish to see in time of peace,they venture to give in an appendix a more detailed state-ment of the relations of the Scientific Departments in the Army Medical Service to the oi-hor branches of the Army Medical ServiceThe above Memorandum was prepared for submission to the Prime Minister before the appended letter from Lord E3her appeared in the &apos;^imes;.&apos; Stronger support for the views advanced above could hardly have been given at the present time.&quot;The Times&quot; Saturday,.&quot;Feb. 3rd.Sir Alfred Keogh andthe Army Council.to the Editor of the Times,Sir,The honour bestowed by the King upon Sir Alfred Keogh will rejoice all thosewho knjw the true tale of the Royal Army Medical Corps during the war,    Some day the full story will be told.The English-speaking world will know what happened in September 1914 and understand the events that led to the recall of Sir Alfred Keogh from the Educational work upon which he was engaged to his old post of control at the War Office.If the Secretary of State for War wishes to recognise the work of Sir Alfred Keogh and that of the R.A.M.C.under his con-trol,there is a method that would appeal to them and him more than any personal honour or distinction. When the Coimnittee of which I was Chairman was reconstituting the W.O.,and proposed to put the Director-General of Medical Services under the Adjutant General, I had a visit from Sir Alfred Keogh \vho in warm and al-most impassioned language tried to induce me to reconsider the proposal. At that time,when we were still under the influence of South African experience,and when only one or two prescient soldiers foresaw the inevitable European war,all military influera ces were brought to bear upon us-to limit the numbers of the Army Council. Ho one except Sir Alfred Keogh could envisage the   A.M.Cother than an important but small branch of the &quot;services1&quot; attached to an army in the field.It was not realised that to keep,a force in the field was at least as vital a necessity as to recruit it.September 1914 swept away this illusion -but the mischief was done.     How much of the suffering undergone by
by our soldiers then and since was due to the short-sightedness of my Committee, and notably of myself,&quot; will never be known.   Certainly the control of the Adjutant-General&apos;s Branch of the R,ACILC Bwas and is responsible not only for the early failure to grip the medical factors of this war, but for the. hampering conditions under which Mr Alfred Keogh has worked,   His triumphs, and those of the R,A0M.C, have been achieved in spi^e of obstacles that the subordination of science to ignorance, of elasticity to military discipline, ex-plains but cannot justify,I would appeal to Lord Derby to strenghen the Arm?/ Council by placing upon it the D.G.M.S., and to free grom the control,of a purely military officer (admirable as is Sir N,Macready in the sphere congenial to him) a body of men mostly volunteers from highly trained professions and dealing with technical difficulties altogether outside the orbit of vision in which the soldier pure and simple habitually moves.     Thus would the work of Sir Alfred Keogh be happily recognised, to the infinite advantage of our sick and woundedito-morrow.Yours faithfully,ESHSR (Sub-Commissioner, British Red Cross in Prance.France 19n7.
(a) The Service ought to bear full responsibility for its clentific direction, and this responsibility ought not to he hared by an Advisory Board in which distinguished surgeonsrid physicians from outside are placed, if the arrangements ingested below are carried out.(b) Special experts will be required in the Service for esearch and for scientific initiative, and their relation to dministration is suggested below.    But it is of-fundamental iiportance that there should be no general cleavage between cientific officers on the one hand and executive officerss such on the other.   The Committee venture to urge most trongly that no R.A.M.C. officer should be placed in any. high sition, whether for administrative or professional duties, io has not had a thorough scientific training, given or tested f proper courses at a Staff College specialised at Millbank. Head of a branch department and no D.D.M.S. should be without 11 power of appreciating the value and applications of ientific method.(c)        It remains to consider the proper place of scientific perts in the organisation of the Service.   The arrangement therto in existence, though temporarily suspended during the r, consists of the posting of two distinguished R.A.M.C. fleers to the Army Medical Advisory Board, the one as Expert Pathology, the other as Expert in Hygiene;   as members of a mmittee, these officers have advisory rather than executive notions, but they are in a position to render valuable service Army research because their position in the Corps gives weight their recommendations.    It is suggested that each of these fleers should be put at the head of .&amp; Bureau, in the A.M.D. the War Office and charged, under the D)G., with the Inistration of Army Pathology and Army Sanitation respectivelyThese new departments would range with the present A. :s 1, 2 and 3 etc., but   here may be called a and b.A.
