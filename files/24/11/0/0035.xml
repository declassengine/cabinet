S E C R E T.From:- Caucasus Military Agent. To:-     D.M.I.20th April, 1917.T.L. 941.Fellowing irom Wave11: -&quot;To-day I returned from Erzinjan and with Colonel Marsh saw Genera]. Tomilof regarding operations of 7th Corps.    He said in view of necessity cf improving supply question, serious &apos;-op or at i &amp;.ns- - would certainly not commence for another month., and that capture of Mosul was probably *ut of the question for same reason, though if Turks advanced South in force, Rowanclus would be occupied and Mosul could be threatened from there.We also saw General Bolkhcvitinof, who said he had been roviewing question of supply in Persia and was satisfied that supply of any large force on Ramadan, Kcrmanchah, Khanikin line was quite impossible.       He suggested that main force 1st Caucasus Cavalry..Corps would be transferred to RamadanP Campno, Suleiman Iyen line and Suleiman Iyeh qecupied . in force and said it would be impossible to guarantee supply beyond this point.    He said, with regard to 7th Corps, that&quot; supply was not so difficult but that it would be necessary to push cn horse tramway which is being built from Haidarabad towards Rowandus before a serious advance to that,point could be attempted, and that from supply point of view an advance to Mosul was totally out of the question.     Effect of above is, in fact, that Russians have made a complete volte-face since changes in staff,  .nd have abandoned proposed advance in force On Mosul, and will content themselves with occupying and holding general line Rowandus, Sul-aimaniyeh, Kisil, Robat. General Bolkhovitinof said that from this line in co-operating with,Force &quot;d&quot; in approximation to Tekrit Samarra area an attempt by Turks on Baghdad or to re-occupy Persia could be defeated.Colonel Marsh concurs in above.
