TRANSPORT ARRANGEMENTS IN RUSSIA. Memorandum &quot;by the Admiralty..The Board of Admiralty have had before them Secret Print G. **-  137 containing a report by Major David Davies. K.P.,  cn the recent British Mission to Russia,  and think it desirable to in-vite attention to certain of the statements and recommendations in the report, which appear to them to call for comment *(l) The recommendation is made that a Director of Transport should be appointed at Petrcgrad cn the staff of General Poole; thai all Naval and Military Officers engaged at the Ports and any other paintd should be under his direct&apos; supervision,  and that he&apos; should be the medium for information to all Departments at home and supply them with returns which would enable them to &quot; regulate the despatch of vessels to Russian Ports,    Ke would alsc deal with questions of priority and export.The Admiralty do not agree with this proposal so far as Naval Transport Officers are affected.    It is considered essential that Military Authorities should have nc control over Naval Trans-port.    The dividing line between the sphere of responsibilitv of the Navy and Army in transport matters is  &quot;High water mark or the-ship&apos;s side&apos;.   This rule is based cn long practical experience and has been followed with success in all theatres of the war..It is also considered Impracticable that the central ccn-trol of transport should be at Petrograd,   Under the present or-ganisation it- is in London,  and results last year showed that a greater amount cf shipping has been dealt with at Archangel than has. ever been dealt with hitherto.    The organisation has been greatly improved for the coming season,  and provided the- state of Russia allows it, there is no doubt&apos;that the imports into Russia this season through Archangel should exceed previous records.(2) The report,- page 9, paragraph 2,  contains the remark that Commodore Kemp (Senior&apos; Na-val Officer, White Sea) does net confine his activities to the duties which have been entrusted to him. but has also assumed supervision cf Naval transport arrangements at Archangel,  and has consequently developed unpleasant relations with Captain Bevan,  the Naval Transport Officer at Archangel.This statement is not in accordance with the facts. Captain Beven returned from Russia in December,  and will not go back until Archangel is re-opened for traffic-   During his absence Commodore Kemp has been in direct touch with the Admiralty respect-ing the arrangements for the forthcoming season.    The instructions issued to both Officers clearly define their respective duties, and there has been no cause for complaint as to their relations. The question was closely enquired into by Admiral Sir Martin Jerram, who was a member of the Mission,  and his report does not support that of Major David Davies.    It is not proposed therefore to make any further re-arrangement -of duties.(3) As rtega-rds the inability of Naval Officers to speak Russian, every endeavour has been made to send out for this season Officers who know the language.    Three Officers are being sent who have a very good knowledge of -Russian,  and one with a moderate knowledge. It isy however,  impracticable to remedy this defect completely.G.T. 522.-. .ADMIRALTY,  S.W. 21st, April)
