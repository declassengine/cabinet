SjC RET. G.T. 545.WAR . CABINET.PAPER AND PAPER-MAKING MATERIALS. (including Waste Paper).Memorandum   &quot;by   Ministry   of   MunitionsThe Government decided that for 1917/18 the total quantity of Paper--and Paper--making materials imported into this country&quot;must be reduced to SAC,000 tons.The Paper requirements of the country arc met partly.from imported paper, and partly from material manufactured in this country.     The material manufactured in this country is made from a mixture of pulp and waste paper.     The.restriction of the import of pulp has caused the home manufacturers to increase very largely- the proportion of waste Paper.&quot;The Government -for its own services requires about 175;CCO tons of Paper and Paper Boards during the year, and -towards this the Paper Commission&quot;have agreed to the import of 100,000 tons to meet special Government requirementswhich quantity has been deducted from the total import- of 540.000 tons, thus leaving a balance of -540,000 tons for private consumers.To obtain the remaining 75,000 tons, -which the Government requires for its own services it is necessary that the collection and use of waste Paper should, be controlled. This necessity is proved by tho fact that the price of Wasxe Paper has in-the case of some grades risen to over ten times the pre-war.price.     Moreover the competition for Taste Paper has prevented some of the Mills working on Government supplies from obtaining adequate quantities.The Ministry of Munitions have drafted an order for the control of Waste Paper.       The intention of the Ministry of Munitions in the administration of this order is only to protect the supplies of Waste Paper required for Government purposes.but it is necessary to include in the terms of the order the whole of the Waste Paper collected., and there appears to be some fear on tho part of the newspaper proprietors lest tho Ministry of Munitions should go further than the protection of their own supplies and control the distribution   of the whole of the Waste Paper cf the Country.     The&quot;grades of Waste used, in the manu-facture of Newspapers are,&quot; however, quite distinct from those used in the production of the Paper and Paper Boards which the Gov erranent r equir e s.The form of this order and the prices have been approved by representatives of the Master Printers, Master Bookbinders, Waste Paper Merchants and Paper Makers and the Newspaper Proprietors would also probably agree.A further proposal hashowever; been put forward that the Paper Supplies- of the Country should be subject, to the Priority system which governs other supplies in which the Ministry of Munitions is- interested..Under the present regulations of the Paper Commission each Importer is rationed on a basis representing a. percentage of his consumption in. the previous year&quot;.     The wholesale distributors and manufacturers thus rationed are under obligation to supply their customers on the same principle.     Makers of chocolate boxes are by this system entitled to their proportion, but manufacturers. now requiring paper and paper boards for the
first time are shut out.     Yet some of the latter require the supplies for packing essential supplies (food, etc.) in substitution for wood and metal, the use of which for most packing purposes has been stopped.The Ministry of Munitions proposes that the whole control of Paper and Waste Paper be vested in the Paper Commission, whoso powers and duties should he enlarged accord-ingly, and recommends that the Paper Commission should continue to take charge of the restriction of imports and administer the. proposed order fixing the price of Waste Paper.It is also recommended that tho present rationing .-system of the Paper Commission.whereby the non-essential trades get a ration and many of the essential trades go without should be replaced by a Priority certificate system governing both imported-and-home-made paper so that a control-can be established to prevent paper being used for non-essential purposes.   The priority certificate system should be administered by the Paper Commission and priority should be given in accordance with a scheme to be agreed.with the. Ministry of MunitionsJand other Departments concerned, so that all those engaged on the manufacture of direct war requirements, newspapers, railway tickets, and other essentials would be entitled to thefts supplies of paper in due order of priority.In ordes- to carry out these enlarged duties, the Paper Commission ?/ould require to be re-const!ij^eOtf; by the addition of representatives of the Government Departments concerned, and the principal users, or the Eoard of Trade might consider it better to administer the whole matter department ally.MINISTRY OP MUNITIONS. April 25th, 1917.
