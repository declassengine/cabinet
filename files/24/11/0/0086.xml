SECRET G.T. 586Prom Military Attache, Athens. Ho. 105, 16th April, 1917, To      The D.M.I.   War Office.I enclose a note on the present situation in Continental Greece.Although the Entente Legations have returned to town from Salamis Strait more than a month ago, normal relations have not &quot;been resumed with the Court and Govern-ment, owing to the maintenance of the blockade, and a strained situation is the result, tending to enhance the estrangement which has existed since the events of December, so that the mistrust on both sides has distinctly increased.(Signed)   W..E, FAIRHOLME.Brigadier General,Military Attach!.
The situation here is very unsatisfactory and no improvement seems likely, given the existing elements.The maintenance of the blockade is doing no good what-ever.     It is only irritating our opponents and alienating our former friends.Royalist Greece has been rendered incapable of doing us any serious military harm, if it ever meant to;    it is admitted that the conditions of our last ultimatum have been to all intents carried out, and yet the blockade is main-tained, at the good pleasure of General Sarrail, who does not seem disposed ever to consent to its being raised, and who has been ... allowed   to assume a dictatorship over Greece which threatens to become dangerous.After encouraging Venizelos to rebel and after actively helping him to establish his Provisional Government and to split Greece in two, we have pledged ourselves not to carry the movement to its logical conclusion by helping him, or by allowing him , to upset the existing regime in Old Greece.At the same time the pressure daily brought to bear in support of Venizelists in Old Greece by the British and French Legations, and the former close personal association of Sir Francis Elliot and Monsieur Guillemin With Venizelos himself, render any rapprochement with the King and his Government out&apos; of the question.And yet there is not and has never been any real hostility towards the Entente Powers on the part of the Greek people, and I doubt whether King Constantine himself has ever been really hostile towards us.The apparent majority in Old Greece are genuinely attachedtoon the situation in Old Greece, April 1917.
to their King whose personal popularity is undeniable and they have learnt to execrate Venizelos, who is represented to them as the rebel who wants to dethrone the King, and to plunge Greece into the horrors of a war against invincible Germany,If a Venizelist rising in Athens is not actually feared at this moment, the Royalists certainly are afraid that Venizelist agents provocateurs will try to force the hands of the Entente Powers by creating incidents and no doubt there are also plenty of political intriguers on the Royalist side, and of paid German agents, ready to make trouble if possible.However in spite of alarming reports received by the Entente Legations from Venizelist sources of what was going to happen on the anniversary of Greek Independence, the 7th April passed off without the slightest disturbance.It has been attempted to make capital out oi the dis-covery of the secret orders issued to some Royalist leagues by their heads for that occasion, dividing them into squads, under leaders who were named, and assigning to each squad its place along the route to be followed by the Royal Procession on its way to and from the Cathedral, and stating that the members were to act with the powers of secret police for the day. There was however no mention of any contemplated action other than that of keeping order and protecting the King.The document, a copy of which was sold to our secret service, and which appears to be genuine, certainly proves that either the Leagues of Reservists have been maintained, contrary to the stipulations of our ultimatum, or that other similar oragnisat ions exist,, but it affords no evidence what-  , ever of levil intentions.I do not think myself that there is any danger at present of serious trouble in Old Greece, especially as Venizelos apparently intends to keep within the boundariesassigned
assigned to him until the war is over or the situation changes for other reasons, &quot;but there are signs that the French policy in Greece is about to become more active and that more drastic measures against the present regime may be contemplated by the new Government, or by General Sarrail acting on his own initiative.An occupation of Greece and the dethronement of King Gonstantine, which seems to be what certain French influences11have been working for all along, and which I feel convinced are still contemplated in more than one influential quarter, would probably divert for an indefinite period at least 20,000 to 30,000 troops which I imagine could ill be spared, and it is difficult to see what corresponding advantage would be obtainedm iother than the gratification of the feeling of revanche for the events of the 1st of December,events which would never have occurred but forthe series of mistakes committeed in dealing with Greek affairs. . If it is desired now to make the best of a bad situation it is essential that the present French Minister  ; should be replaced by a diplomat of more even and conciliatory temperament and strong enough to restrain the provocative activi- i ties of the French Military and secret service agents which have done much mischief in the past.   Monsieur Gui11emin&apos;s nerves have evidently been affected by recent events here,and he is obviously in constant fear of fresh disturbances and acts of violence.   He eagerly swallows all alarmist rumours, however irresponsible or interested their source, and telegraphs them at great length,to his Government* He is entirely dominated by General Sarrail.IIInstead of occupying the Legation he lives in a hotel,fwhich does not add to the prestige of the French Minister.   He     If\has always been personally disliked by King Constantine. If the blockade is ever taken off I suppose it isintended
-4-intended that normal relations should he resumed between the Entente Corps Diplomatique and the Court, and between the Military Attaches and the War Off ice and General Staff, but I must confess that I do not see how this can be done, in the case of the British and French Legations as at present constituted with any hope of success, in view of the feelings of personal resentment and distrust which have been the natural consequence on both side of all that has happened in the last few months. To sum up:Greece is now powerless to harm us militarily, since her Army and practically all her rifles and warlike stores have been bottled up in the Peloponnesus, while the presence of the Officers of General Cauboue^ Commission, dotted about all over the country, will ensure that the military situation does not change to ou-r detriment.If we are not satisfied with this the only further step possible would be to occupy the country and dethrone the King. That would however cost us a greater military effort than the results would justify.It would therefore seem best to raise the blockade at once and to try to establish a modus Vivendi on as friendly a footing towards the present regime in Old Greece as our existing commitments to Venizelos and the Provisional Government will admit of.The task would have to be entrusted to new men who are not obnoxious to the King owing to their past close association with the Venizelist movement, and who are not obsessed by the fear of a repetition of the reign of terror of the 1st and 2nd December.The Russian Minister has always been on excellent terms with the King and Royal Family, and the Italian Minister has
from the first disassociated himself from all support of Venizelos, so that there waULkcl seem to he no reason for recalling them.(Signed)   W,E. FAIRHOLME,Brigadier General, Military Attach!.Athens, 13th April, 1917. H.B.The above   note has been shown by me to Brigadier General Phillips who requests me to say that he is in entire agreement with the views expressed in it.
