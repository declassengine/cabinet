SECRETIOTjjS   received from Captain Hartley, Chemical Adviser Third Army,, regarding the effect of the counter-battery work carried out on Third Army front.The infantry wore not expecting an immediate attack and were taken by surprise by our infantry advancing immediately the barrage started.     They said that our attack was very skilfully carried out, and that in the absence of any barrage firo from their own artillery they could do nothing against it.Their morale had suffered greatly from the accuracy and severity of our artillery fire, from shortage of food, and from lack of support from their own artillery*40 gunners were examined from 21 battery positions, They were questioned about the causes of their failure on the day of attack, and on the effects produced by the gas shell bombardment on the night of April 8th/9th.They were not expecting our attack until a later date.    Their preparations to meet it wore incomplete * A large proportion of their batteries had only corno into the line within the last few days, and others were being regrouped.   All the prisoners examined spoke of the accuracy of our fire against battery positions^    The more intelligent commented on the accuracy of our information and maps, and the excellence of the co-operation between our artillery and air observers,    Only one out of the twenty one batteries had not been engaged although several had only been in position a few days.&quot;During the preliminary bombardment a large proportion of the enemy1s guns and emplacements wore damaged by direct hits-,     .Many ammunition dumps near batteries were blown up, and the intensity of the fire disorganised the
ammunition supply. Consequently on the day of attack, only a small proportion of guns were able to open fire.In some batteries all the guns had been knocked out by direct hits, and almost all batteries had one or two guns ou$ of action.     One 15 cm battery had only 27 shell.at Zere on April 9th, another had 600 gas shell without any propellant charges.The general feeling among the prisoners was that our guns had given them no chance.The lethal gas shell fired on the evening of April 8th c&amp;use-d-a few casualties in the batteries, and in some cases the infantry near gun positions suffered considerably.     The laohrymatory shell fired during the night 8th/9th caused considerable inconvenience. They interfered with the movement of transport, and one group of 7.7 cm batteries in Battery Valley was prevented from getting ammunition.     In a number of batteries it was impossible -to leave-a dug-out without wearing a gas mask, and in some cases the masks were worn in dug-outs.Owing to the high velocity of the wind any lethal shells fired early in the morning of the 9th were ineffective.Prisoners reported that the gas shells fell close to their battery positions, in one ^se knocking oat the guns by direct hits.The Prisoners&apos; statements show that the destruction of their batteries had been so successfully carried, out before any gas shells were fired.that the latter only contributed slightly to the general result;    if ohe destruction had been less complete the gas shells might have played a more Important role.H.Q., Third Army. 13.4.17.
