DELME RADCLIFFE Brigadier-General.To Lt-GeneralSir William Robertson, G.C.B., etc.,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office.Ahi
ITosT TJRG^HT * S ISC R   T . With Italy of 30th April iviv-^- -&apos; Ho.- 958.15th April,1917.INTJtfDSISA G-JIORAJj^ OF TED ARIiY.Directorate of Transports..Subject;     Reserves of Goal;Pressure to be brought to hear on the British GovernmentTO THIil COMAHDO SIPRJiMO.Operations,Branch.On the 6th of this month the Intendant-General of the Army called the attention of the War Minister to the rapid and alarming diminution in the reserve stock ef coal for&apos;the railways, in order that he might join in the pressure to be brought by the General-Directorate of the State Railways, through the Ministry of Transports, in order to obtain a quick and sufficient increase in the supply through tho agency of the special office created for that purpcse, that is to say, the Commissariat-General for Coal Supplies.It is necessary to point out what is the general situation as regards tho coal supply at the present mementoThe average monthly consumption (for all the requirements of the country) is about 800,000 tons, of which 230,000 tons are used by the railways.        In each of the months of January, February and March the imports amounted to only -3&amp;0.000 tons.     The monthly deficit, therefore, amounted to 450,000 tons,- reducing, by so much,-the existing reserve stocks, which, at the;date of writing,-are reduced to just over 600,000 tons, of which 340,000 tons are stacked on the railways and are equivalent to 40 days requirements only.In the absence of quick and adequate arrangements and should the excess of consumption over imports continue on the same scale, it is to be foreseen that during May the reserve stocks of coal will be reduced to nothing, bringing about the complete paralysis of the railways and of all the industrial establishments.   Tho prospect is of an alarming
gravity, but it&apos;should not be hidden.H.E. the War Minister called General Fiastri, the Director of Transports, to Rome yesterday, in order to discuss the subject and strongly urged upon him to diminish the transports as.much as possible, since an economy in consumption is certainly one of the means for meeting the situation.&apos;&apos;General Fiastri replied that orders had already been given to the various commands - Mobilised and Territorial - to reduce tc the minimum their requisitions for transport and to use movements by road instead, &quot;as Was done by the CComarido Supreme recently in the case of the-53rd and 54th Mobilised Divisions.   But there should be no illusion that this means can achieve a notable economy since the great mass of the transports - for supplies of &quot;every kind, for drafts&apos;.cf men and for the movement of troops and detachments to considerable distances - necessitate the use of the railways.&quot; On the contrary, it should be noted that just now an increase cf most urgent transports for the.re-supply of the Central Depots is beginnin and that, also, the general requirements of the country call for:an intensification of the transports so much so, that the recent fresh&apos;reductions of passenger trains have not resulted in any economy in -coal; as the engines thus rendered available v^ere employed&apos;f or moving goods trains; to satisfy requirements that had been neglected for some time.-&apos;   General Fiastri conferred yesterday in Rome also with Ccmmendatcre Bianchi, Commissary-General for Coal Supplies, and received reliable information that, while the agreements made In London at -the end of January by members- cf* the Government (among- whom was H.E. Ahccna, Under-Secretary of State for Transports) should have resulted In February and March In an increase of the -transports of coal from England to Italy, there was not, on the contrary, the slightest sign of any such
increase.   He also learnt that the initiative taken by Commcndatore Bianchi to bring about an importation of coal from America (of about 130,000 tone a month) was wrecked by the financial and diplomatic difficulties put forward by the R oya 1 G- over ninent sIn consequence of the new and favourable situation &quot;created by the entry of the United States of America into the war, steps will bo taken at once to assure., to Italy a supply of coal from that market; but, naturally, It must not be thought that this can lead to the immediate result which is so urgently-necessary.Hothing remains, therefore, but to press that the above-mentioned agreements of London should be, fully and immediately, carried out and that the British, Government - in co-operation with the special Inter-Ally Bureau for the distribution of Ships - should allot, by any means possible and at once, a satisfactory amount of tonnage for the trans-port of coal &quot;from &quot;&quot;ngland to Italy,It is known that the Royal Government has taken the matter up through diplomatic channels; but this Intendanco-General considers the authoritative intervention of the Comando Supremo not only useful but necessary in order - that, through the highest British Military authority, the whole vital importance of the question, especially on military grounds, may be explained and for a clear declaration to be made of the fact, that, if our Ally /&quot;ngland does not supply us with coal abundantly, not only will the efficiency, but also the very existence of the Field Army, be compromised fatally very shortly,The IntcndantrGenpral of the Army, -   (Sighed)   &apos; LOMBARD!*
