Among the particular questions which engaged the attention of the Branch was the effect of the withdrawal of the Railway &quot;Carriage Forward&quot; facilities on the operation of the Board&apos;s scheme for the distribution of sittings of eggs.    An effort was made to induce the Railway Executive Committee to reinstate the &quot;Carriage Forward&quot; system for the duration of the Scheme, &quot;but that &quot;body did not find it possible to accede to the Board&apos;s request:   it consequently &quot;became necessary to inform all the station holders (approximately 240) that the &quot;Carriage Forward&quot; system had &quot;been withdrawn.
