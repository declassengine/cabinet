rC R S T.. ..   WAR   CABINET.5: T. - 523.       STRIKES : THEIR EFFECT ON THE CONSTRUCTION AND-   REPAIRS ; OF H .M.SHIPS .(Memorandum by the Third Sea Lord of the Admiralty)r,e Mersey Strike, December 1916*.     V&apos;-----   &apos; - &quot;*       &quot;        &apos; j an:Owing to their objection to        anard of the Committee production, the Boilermakers on the Mersey began in the middle of ast November by refusing to work overtime, and ceased work altogether rom December 9th to 18th.Among the effects of the strike in retarding the onstruction and repair cf H.M. Ships, one of the most unfortunate as the enforced delay in the completion of 3 vessels of the 10th -ruiser Squadron which wore refitting, at the time.     As a result, hey could not sail from Liverpool to rejoin their Squadron till idnight December 24th; instead of several days earlier as originally rranged.     This, together with other causes, led to an abnormally epleted condition of the Squadron on the night of December 24th/25th., ihich was no doubt responsible for the escape of the. German Raider &apos;YARROWDALE&quot;.     -  Upon this incident the Vice-Admiral Commanding eported that &quot;the principal cause of the f&apos;YARR0WDALE&quot; being able o get through undetected would undoubtedly appear to be the small iiimber of ships actually on patrol at the time;&quot; and-the Cornmander-in-Chief in forwarding this report observed that &quot;it is.not known ihether the situation as regards strikes has improved since December, ut it,is considered that drastic measures should be taken to prevent hips being delayed from this cause&quot;.strikes in, 1917.The most serious strikes this year have been those at Earrow and on the Tyne.The strike of Engineers and Allied Trades at Messrs. &apos;/ickersr   Works at Barrow,   lasted 12 days and affected&apos; 5850 employees, mis caused considerable &quot;delay to the propelling machinery and mechanical hull fittings of Cruisers and Submarines under construction and on Rigid Airships.      On March 31st the Firm reported that &quot;this w;^rk is being carried on by apprentices with the assistance of labourers, wich must have a very serious effect on output.     The launch of Submarine &quot;L 1&quot;, for instance, arranged for April 10th must be post-poned indefinitely&quot;.On the Tyne all the Engineers ceased work on&apos; March Wth for a week, involving 30,000 men&quot;and a loss of 1,590,000 hours&apos; fork.     There were also strikes in this district in February which caused a further 270,000 hours1 loss.In all these cases, though It is difficult accurately to estimate the effect on output .of new construction, it must be remembered that the general disturbance of work produces.a further loss of time.about equal, to the number of hours lost in the strike itself.     This estimate&apos; is borne out by the. opinion of the Firms concerned: and naturally all classes of new construction In hand in the respective.areas including AntI-Submarine Vessels are affected.H^-.Ships under Repair.The following is a list of H.M.Ships in hand for J^fit during the period of strikes in 1917, whose completion has been, thereby delayed:-
