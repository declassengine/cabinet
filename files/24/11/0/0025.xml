REPORT ON THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION.By Major J. F. NEILSON, 10th Royal Hussars, attached to the Russian Army.Petrograd,31st March, 1917.Effect of Revolution on the 5th Army.1. Outbreak, of the Revolution. The situation in the 5th A.rmy was much worse than in any other, for the reason that it was in closer touch with Petrograd.Events followed each other so quickly and so unexpectedly that, before one knew it, the authority of the officers had been torn from them.The first feeling was one of a sudden and unexpected lifting of all restraint; a removal of the bonds which had shackled a nation for thousands of yeais. Each man suddenly felt himself free ; in a moment an entity, and no longer a cipher. Like hounds at fault, they all threw up their heads, and like indifferent hounds, waited for a lead, i The first line they got was the famous &quot; Order No. of the Labour Party. This was read to mean that the officers had no longer any authority. In the twinkling of an eye they had none.2. Attitude of officers. At this stage the officers, as a whole, did nothing to stem the tide, and their only chance was lost. They were in utter ignorance of what was taking place beyond what they actually saw before their eyes Everything happened so quickly that before the officers could realize their own position they found themselves powerless.By 16th March they were being disarmed; those who resisted were killed. They were no longer saluted, and were hustled and openly insulted in the streets.3. Release of prisoners. Prisons were opened, and along with political prisoners were set free murderers and professional burglars. These immediately dressed them-selves in soldiers&apos; uniform, and mingling with the soldiers, already intoxicated by freedom, did their utmost to set them against their officers. Aiding this movement-were agitators from Petrograd, sent by the Labour Party.4. Conduct of civilians and soldiers. The civilian population of Dvinsk took the side of the agitators. The population is mainly Jewish, and the most respectable of them took the side of law and order. There was no drunkenness and the soldiers really committed few excesses. They were certainly in a state of open mutiny and completely dominated their officers, but I never expected to see a Russian crowd behave with such restraint. The General commanding the garrison was arrested and kept in prison (this was done in all towns as far as I have been able to ascertain). A few officers whoi resisted the crowd or whose patience failed to stand the insults offered were killed. These were isolated cases and not organized murder.The arrest of the Garrison Commander was carried out by a few men who had a personal grievance. A few houses were burned, Law&apos; Court records were destroyed, and several stores of supplies were looted. These things were done more by hooligans than by the troops themselves.Working on the side of law and order were a large number of soldiers, who really J took a most strikingly sane view of events in general.   They held meetings and made j speeches without end.   They were helped by the Jews who had something to lose, and who had aspirations regarding their future status.5. Effect on the troops in the trenches. As soon as the news reached the troops in, the trenches they began to flock into Dvinsk. I have been able to find no cases off serious disorders in the trenches, but the men took the law into their own hands and completely disregarded their officers. It is perfectly natural that men living in immediate contact with the enemy should take a more sane view of events. The officers tried to talk the men over, but they themselves were in a staLe of complete ignorance and could not produce any arguments capable of convincing them. Their authority was lost, both they and the men knew this.   Desertion had begun and* Order No. I. advised the soldiers to disregard the authority of their officers and to assume charge of the armies and of the internal discipline.(B17/282)   15  4/17  HAS  4434wo
increased with alarming rapidity. The steadier and more reasonable remained in the trenches, while the more turbulent element streamed back.6. Non-combatants-ln the neighbourhood of Dvinsk were already 15,000 men in reserve, a large number of them artillerymen. There were an enormous number of non-combatants, consisting of by far the niost troublesome element. Transport, always undisciplined and unruly. Motor companies, technical detachments, clerks, telegraphists. All semi-educated, and from the towns. As a matter of fact as soon as events began to take shape, and the danger of an active mutiny became apparent, the motor companies changed to the side of the more moderate, and even did much to help the officers.Reading this, one probably gains the impression that events have been exaggerated, the danger lay not in what the men did, but what they could, and might do at any moment.7. Authority abolished. The officers, from the Army Commander to the last joined, had lost all semblance of authority, and the men fully realized they were masters of the situation. In all Russia there was not a single regiment which could be trusted to suppress disorder.The entire 5th Army had been transformed by &quot; Order No. I.&quot; from the Russianversion of a fighting machine, disciplined and precise, into a howling mob graduallyworking up its wrath against its officers.Up to 19th March the officers had done but little, if anything, to stem the tide,they were ignorant of the real state of affairs, and were afraid o  their men. They I had reasm to be. They had nothing, literally nothing, to back their word with. Any I protest held out little hope of anything save death on the spot. Everything military I came to a standstill; at every street corner, all day long, were meetings and speeches. * The agitators egged the men on, and the more moderate restrained them.   The exeite-ment grew and grew, and the men became more embittered against their officers till itwas all but impossible to show one&apos;s self in the street.8. The Staff. In all Staffs all military work came to a.standstill, and the OperationSection was transformed into a Political Bureau.   I spent a considerable time in theOperation Section of the Army Staff, and the situation was one * to appal the stoutestheart.The army had ceased to exist, and the enemy had but to advance to take Dvinsk and scatter to the four winds of heaven a horde of deserters. The only point which admitted of argument was whether the German or the Russian soldiers would first succeed in killing the officers.The Staff was in a state of wildest despair. The elder officers saw the seriousness of the situation, and the appalling consequences it entailed. The younger, and hotter-headed officers, up to the time I left, felt only a sense of deep humiliation and insult. In my opinion this constitues a very grave danger. Nothing can save the situation but the tact and self-restraint of the officers. The senior officers have put aside their feelings and act with great tact, on the other hand the junior only thought of their humiliating position, and in my opinion did little to help matters. The crisis came on 19th March. Many cases of officers being insulted, and also disarmed, a few had been killed. One officer had shot a soldier for insulting him (I cannot understand why, but this officer was imprisoned and not killed).9. Attempt to restore autho.rity.-In Rejitsa (near Dvinsk) a cavalry regiment sent to restore order had been made prisoners. This &quot;was a stupid attempt to restore order. 500 cavalrymen against at least 15,090 well-armed men. They had very indefinite instructions, and ended by doing nothing. They remained loyal to their officers, but virtually joined the mob. Later the colonel was killed, and the second in command had to fly for his life. This was not done in the presence of the men. All the time the telegraph and telephone worked. Several times every day telegrams had been sent to the Staff front begging for explanations and instructions. Telegrams asking that Deputies from the Provisional Government should be sent to talk to the men and explain matters. Up to this date practically nothing had been done. The lead had to come from the Provisional Government, the officers could do nothing. What made matters worse was the fact that we knew an order had been issued by the Labour Party cancelling their Order No. I., but it had not been received. When it did come it was so worded that it made no impression on the men.Notices and manifestations were being printed day and night. Many were cancelled as soon as printed, while thousands were placarded all over the town.The mob was by now very excited, and no help could be expected from anywhere.At 2 a.m. two soldier deputies came to the Chief of the Staff to warn. him that the situation was critical.   They themselves were weary to a degree and very alarmed.
They reported that they and many others had worked unceasingly to restrain the soldiers, but now they had lost their hold and the mob&apos;s patience was exhausted. The agitators had gained the upper hand. They could do no more, and they feared that the mob was coming to attack the Staff. There was still one hope. That was to immediately issue an order directing the men to appoint representatives from each unit to discuss the situation, This would have the effect of keeping the men busy, while some further plan might be worked out.It seemed so utterly unreasonable that the men should murder their officers wholesale, but everything pointed to this. On the night of the 19th we waited for them to come.On 20th March these ropresentatives met, spoke for the most part very reasonably, but could come to no resolution. This day the tension relaxed, but the number of deserters steadily increased. By this time the Army Commander had received numerous deputations, but nothing tangible had resulted.10. Deputies from Provisional Government. On 21st March two deputies from -the Provisional Government arrived, and immediately took the situation in hand. All companies, battalions, regiments and detachments sent representatives elected by the officers afid men together (this was so only nominally, the officers had but little say in the matter). A soldier from each company, an officer or a soldier from each battalion, and from each special unit or detachment a soldier. I was present at these meetings. The deputies were enthusiastically received by the men. To the officers they were polite but in no way acknowledged their superiority. The men were in good humour. Many really excellent speeches were made, moderate in tone and with a most intelligent grasp of the situation. The deputies made good speeches and impressed on the men the necessity of maintaining order and discipline. All enthusiastically expressed their fixed determination to continue the war till victory was reached. All announced their &apos; loyalty to the Provisional Government. The Army Commander was also very well received and made very good speeches, showing great patience and tact. A few voices were raised against the officers, but on the whole the men had nothing to say against the officer. Never once, to the best of my belief, was the subject of the officers&apos; position touched by the deputies.It is of interest to note that a very large number uf the soldier representatives were , Jews.   The general opinion that there will be a pogrom of the Jews eventually was j . not altered by this.The general situation was explained, and the soldiers promised to fulfil their duty, but it is still the men themselves who will decide what will be done.I, as an English officer, had a rousing welcome, and was carried out shoulder high, thrown up in the air in the street, and my motor accompanied by a shouting crowd. It gave me little satisfaction; but at any rate showed that they have nothing against their allies.   If they decide to go home this will not deter them.II. The meetings. There was something unspeakably sad, and sinister, about these meetings. On the platform stood General Abraham Dragomirov, a fine soldier and a fine man. With him many Generals and senior officers. All were restrained -and dignified. Two civilians, devoid of all pretensions of being gentlemen, sure of themselves, and clearly masters of the situation. The audience looked to them as their leaders, and not to the Army Commander. Each man as he came up to speak, bowed low to them, and then a bow full of condescension to General Dragomirov. The Army Commander though well received, meant nothing to them. At lunch time, the deputies without waiting for General Dragomirov to say a word of welcome, made long speeches. Their manner was overbearing and condescending. One made a speech on current affairs, and said he was perfectly satisfied with the situation, and that it had been greatly exaggerated. Nothing was said about the officers&apos; position. The second deputy poured forth a lengthy, &quot;and venomous indictment of the old Government. Little of what he said was news to his hearers, and nothing he said could in any way help the situation. General Dragomirov, with tears in his eyes, but a firm voice, warned them in the mosfr solemn terms that all prestige, authority, and power, had been stripped from the officers. He asked for their help in order to save the country. This appeal elicited no reply.   I also warned them in vain.These men are undoubtedly sincere in their desire to calm the men and get them back to work, but their failure to help the officers cannot have been due to ignorauce. One is forced to believe that this was forced on them by the Labour Party.12. Attitude oj the Labour Party. The attitude of this party is understandable, but unpardoneble. They fear the Army as an organized political body, and to save themselves must separate the officers from the men.   In this they have succeeded, but(4134) a 2
I, personally, think their success is only temporary The men have really no serious complaint against their officers, and when the first novelty of freedom has passed, they will gradually come to hand again.13. Calm partially restored.-After this the atmosphere lightened, and the men became calmer ; still, they showed no inclination to return to their regiments. Even their quite genuine determination to finish the war did not draw them away from Dvinsk. The streets were thronged with a crowd of soldiers, all wearing red bows, and behaving rather like children just released from school. Almost none salute, and all are defiantly free. Any Russian crowd is a flock of sheep with a sprinkling of wolves in sheeps&apos; clothing. Any strong man can lead them, but the man who gets in the last word wins. The chief thing one has to compete with is their grotesquely undeveloped minds and lack of any semblance of understanding. Nine out often have no idea what a revolution means. Except those with a peisonal grouse, none know why they have suddenly grown to hate their officers.14. Peasants&apos; view of the Revolution. From the Revolution one wants more tobacco, another more to eat; more pay is a universal cry, and when one thinks that they receive the sum of 75 kopeeks per month, one sympathises with them. All want a piece of land. Everyone knows he has gained freedom, but they construe this to mean that they are free to do exactly what they want.The majority think a Republic an excellent thing, but disagree as to who should be Emperor. Many wept when they heard that the Emperor had abdicated. The now well-known story of the enthusiast, bedecked with a profusion of red bows, shouting at the top of his voice, &quot; Down with Czardom, down with the Government, long live the Republic, I will lay down my life for the Czar ! &quot; This gives a very fair idea of the views of manv.If Order No. 1 of the Labour Party had never been issued all would have gone smoothly and well, and the Army of to-day would have been a much better one than that of a month ago.15. Opinion of officers. The officers on the Staff of the 5th- Army were very pessimistic. The Staff&apos; of the Front were no better. The Chief of the Staff of the Front declared himself an optimist, but would say no more than that there was &quot; a strong hope that all would right itself.&quot; The situation in the 12th and 1st Armies was much the same as in the 5th, though rather quieter.16. Events at Pskow. In Pskow* there was only one critical day. The Commandant of the town was arrested, but he had been notoriously unfair in his earlier dealings with the men. An admiral was arrested because he tore the red bow off his servant. Here a committee was quickly formed to secure public safety, and order was restored. General Ruzski (Commanding Northern Front, with Headquarters at Pskow) has retained his popularity and his very great authority. He is as capable of dealing with the situation as any man. It is difficult to give a comprehensive account of what took place. It is not the actual deeds done that made the tragedy of it all. A few offi cers were arrested, a few killed, a few houses were burned, and enormous crowds of soldiers collected.I lived through all this with the officers. I saw their power fall from them in a j moment; I saw them drop their hands as the full realization came to them that all was I lost of their former power, that the Army had fallen to pieces like a house of cards, j that nothing could ever restore to them their authority. Many have said to me &quot; What I have we got to fight for now ?&quot; I think they may be forgiven if they say &quot; for me my j country has ceased to exist.&quot; At present it is difficult to see how it can be possible for I any person of social standing to live in Russia. Eight officers out of every ten mean I to come to England after the war. At one time the men were within an ace of choosing &apos; their officers.Relations between officers and men. Russian officers were formerly very autocratic, and enjoyed a great show of respect. One can find fault with many old customs, but before one does so one should know the men.Before the war, the men were for the greater part peasants condemned by the Government to be uneducated, to be drunkards, to live in squalor and need. No&quot; light ever entered their lives. They and their sons and sons sons were fated to live in darkness and degradation. They had been exploited by all and sundry for centuries. In summer they worked from sunrise to sunset in the fields ; in autumn the net results of their w^iT^ m0ni6y msufficient to keeP them, even with continual paring and saving. -With this knowledge they met the never ending dreary winter.* Pskow is a railway junction about half-way from Petrograd to Dvinsk. &quot;
Ignorant, unintelligent, never advancing. A filthy village and a filthy home, want and&apos; misery. Never was a hand stretched out to raise them or to show them a brighter existence. Any hand stretched out found its way to Siberia without trial. The Government had willed that the peasant should remain a machine for tilling land. All were drunkards. What else could they be ? When want pressed heaviest to what could they turn for forgetfulness ? When they wanted joy, what could give it ? When they wanted a drink, what could they drink ? Vodka, vodka, and always vodka. They had to drink it. In every village was a Government drink shop which had to sell so much in the year. Therefore the peasant had to drink. When they had money they drank to find joy.   When they had no money they drank to find oblivion.A recruit arrives unable to read or write, often unable to understand what was said to him ; a wild thing, untamed and frightened. These were addressed as &quot; thou.&quot; This is not as degrading as it seems. In the village all are &quot; thou,&quot; landlord and peasant alike.   The Emperor was &quot; thou,&quot; God is &quot; thou.&quot;They were beaten and cuffed. No peasant resents this, they understand it. If, instead of hitting them, you talk to them and make them feel ashamed; they will ask you &quot; not to torture their souls but to beat them.&quot; They are at all times and seasons roundly cursed in the most obscene and revolting terms. This conveys no insult to them, they imbibed this with their mothers milk. I have seen a man stand like a dejected sheep when asked some simple question, but when he heard the familiar &quot; why the . . . you son of a . . . dont you answer ? &quot; his face lightened up and looked positively intelligent, and the answer came at once. All this has now passed and the soldier will be treated like a human being. He will presumably develop into a creature of some understanding, and the new military regime will suit his new condition as the old suited his previous condition.Like all things new in Russia of late years, this change has come too suddenly, the nation was not ready for it. The nation has gained a freedom it deserved, but, like an animal suddenly let loose from a cage, they run wild, not knowing what freedom means. There has been no intermediate stage, they have practically sprung from serfdom to complete independence. I, personally, would never have thought them capable of showing the restraint they have. It means that there is much good in the nation, which has, up to now, been suppressed by the Governments attitude.Everyone in Russia, with the exception of the Court party, desired the&apos;change. The officers were even more outspoken than the civilians ; in this they were at one with the soldiers. The soldiers have gained their freedom and the officers have lost theirs. No intelligent officer, after he has got over the strangeness of it, will object to calling the men &quot;you,&quot; and not &quot;thou.&quot; They will grow accustomed to being called &quot; Mr. General&quot; or &quot; Mr. Lieutenant.&quot; The abolition of that stupid custom of giving set answers to all questions is also an excellent change ; but the very roots of discipline have been torn up by the abolition of saluting, also by allowing the men complete freedom to take part in political and other meetings. The formation of committees in each company must also destroy discipline.The nation will develop and become more cultured, and the soldier will rise at the same time. This was impossible under the old regime in the Army. What spoils this picture of poace and goodwill to men is the fact that an uneducated and unintelligent mass has suddenly emerged from a form of slavery and been placed on a. level with cultured and developed nations. In a word, the man has to raise himself to the level of his new treatment. Could we rule an African tribe by treating them as Englishmen ? The Russian soldiery may eventually raise itself, but the process will take many years, and in the interval chaos must reign. Unfortunately it is precisely this interval which most concerns us. The situation to-day is that the officers no longer. rule the Army. They have lost that power which lay behind the word and made obedience necessary. In the future if the^men obey, it will be because they choose to, and not because they have to.18. Trade Unionism in the Army. Trade Unionism in the Army cannot make efficiency. I want to punish a man. The case will go before the Company Committee. A man wants leave. The ,Company Committee decides. One day they will decide I am not a desirable officer, andd will have to go. The men have proved to themselves that the officers words are after all but words. They have defied them and emerged scathless. They know that the power lies in their own hands. When matters reached a deadlock, civilians stepped in and gave their decision over the heads of the officers. Never again, at any rate during the war, can the officers have any authority over their &apos; men.   Personally, I do not think they will ever have any. I19. Future discipline.-Whatever discipline there may be will be founded on public opinion.   In Russia in general, and in the Army in particular, this great force
has only just been born, and one cannot expect sound sense from it. In the past the officer class was extremely overbearing, everything gave way to it. To-day they are humbled and stripped bare&quot; of all authority and position. In time, soldiers will cease to openly insult them, but they will never respect them again. The position of the officers to-day is well-nigh unbearable. The future holds out no hope of &quot;consolation. At the moment the men are filled with a new enthusiasm; this will make them fight better when things go well. It was impossible, to keep them in the trenches before when things were bad.   Now nothing will keep them.O20. Causes of anarchy.-I attribute the present state of chaos to the following: (i.) Order No I. of the Labour Party.(ii.) In the Army, ignorance of current events and what line to take, (iii.) Failure of the Provisional Government to take immediate steps, (iv.) Inaction of the officers in the initial stages.(v.) The work of agitators, some sent by the Labour Party and some inde-pendent.It was clear at once that the lead must come from the new Government, the officers were powerless. The soldiers really were not aware they were deserting, they simply wanted to make holiday. When once collected in large numbers,&quot;and fallen under the influence of agitators, they unearthed many grievances against their officers which a moment before they had been unaware of. In reality the men have nothing of any importance against their officers.21. The outlook. At the moment the outlook is indeed a black one, but I believe I that the men will tire of holiday making, and will return to their regiments.   It will I be a long time before they can be welded together into anything resembling an army. ! Discipline will be replaced by trade unionism.   The men should be filled with a new enthusiasm ; they have now more to fight for.   Before, they had no concrete idea that they were fighting for Russia.   They defended their village, and fought for the Czar. If the Government is only strong enough to speak, its mind and not let the Labour Party override them, they can easily teach the men that they are now fighting for the freedom , they have just won.   Is there any man this will not appeal to ?   If, on the other hand, I the Government do not do this, the men&apos;s quite genuine determination to go on with \ the war will finish with patriotic speeches and hurrahs in the rear of the armies. The feeling is still so strained that a trifling incident may turn the tide in either direction.   I am very much afraid of the young officers.   They have not a true view of the position.   They feel humiliation and insult more than the necessity to lay aside all personal feelings and somehow or other hold the army together till the Allies beat the Germans.During these days the enemy undertook no active operations ; if they had done so they would have saved the Russian army from falling into the state it is in now. It is impossible to foretell, what will happen in the army just as it is impossible to foresee future internal events. The only thing which is certain is that discipline has gone for ever. The future depends on whether the power of the Labour Party increases or decreases.22. Armys power of offensive. My personal opinion is that the army will be able to act on the defensive, but I cannot see how any large offensive, can be expected to meet wTith success. So many impossible things have happened in the last few weeks that perhaps an offensive may not be impossible. Nothing more than a defence can be relied on, and no one will promise that.Without taking into consideration current events, the earliest date for a large offensive on the Northern Front is about 15th May. In order to be on the safe side the possibility of a German offensive is put at 1st May. This I think is out of the question There is more snow this year than has ever been seen, and it has only just begun to thaw. By nature the country is one vast bog, and this year the floods will be a record. The Russians have therefore a month to put their house in order ; if. they cannot do it in this time they will never do it.If the Labour Party will allow it, I consider that the Russians will be able to undertake an active defensive ; they will at any rate attempt an offensive, and at the worst, will continually hold out such a threat that the Germans will be forced to maintain considerable forces on this front. Every one expects a German offensive. If they want to, and have the troops available, they can take any position. The question is how much time they will have for this operation. I do not think they can undertake any very ambitious operation.   If the Russians start by a success, all will probably go
well. If they suffer a defeat, I fear for the, results. It is impossible to foresee anything at present. One thing is certain. There will be no more discipline. The army and the nation mean to continue the war, whether they do so or not depends on the Labour Party.Effect of Revolution in Moscow.23. In Petrograd all are pessimists; in Moscow all are optimists. The authorities say they are going to set the tone for Russia. If they succeed in doing this I think there is hope for Russia.When I arrived in Petrograd from the front I was at once struck by a new feeling of &quot; humaneness&quot;; people in the streets were more polite, more considerate to one another. At the same time a cold feeling gripped ones heart an unnatural stillness, as if everyone felt fear; an unnatural silence, as if everyone felt an unseen danger walking behind him. I have never seen s&quot;uch order in Russia before, but still the atmosphere was not natural; as if Petrograd lived on a dormant volcano which at any moment might break out.In Moscow one does not feel this. Here the streets are more alive, traffic moves quicker, as if everyone had work to do, as if everyone had suddenly been allowed to work. The public is more considerate. Even the cab drivers have changed; they are no longer juggernauts, they know that if they behaved as formerly they would get into trouble.There is no police and few patrols. Traffic is much as it was before. The old police never gave any help to the traffic, so their presence is not missed.Moscow prides itself on doing everything differently from Petrograd. Moscow certainly intends that there shall be no disorders.24. The Commander of the Moscow district. I have seen Colonel Gruzinov,who now commands the Moscow district. He is a young man, and gives the impression of being a man of great strength of character. He said tome &quot; please inform your Government that we are determined to carry the war through to a finish.&quot; He shortly expects to send drafts to the front and he is going to make it a triumphant procession. Perhaps there will even be a spectacle given in the big theatre. Bands will accompany the troops, and the people will see them off. This is ah excellent plan. It will bring home to people that they have something worth defending, that it is a thing worth doing, a thing of honour, and not merely an order of a Government they hate.25. Attitude of the soldiers. The soldiers joined in the triumphant procession which celebrated their freedom, only on the condition that there should be no talk, or flags, or inscriptions in favour of peace. I think in Moscow there is a genuine determination to finish the war.When I told Colonel Gruzinov of the state of affairs on the front, he said he would immediately arrange that deputies should be sent there.They say he is not experienced in modern warfare. What does that matter ? He is a man of character, he has the peoples&apos; confidence, and he appears to be determined to carry the war through to victory.Iam not a revolutionary myself; I hate revolutions, and have an Englishman&apos;s respect for Sovereigns and my superior officers, but I frankly confess that my five-minute talk with this man gave much more pleasure, and much more confidence in the future, than a week with the usual General who holds such a command.    The old type j was completely engrossed by routine and medals.   This man knows what he has to do, I and works for that alone.Many abuses have been swept away.    I fear that under a socialistic Government new, and may be even worse ones will appear.J. F. NEILSON, Major.10th Royal Hussars.
