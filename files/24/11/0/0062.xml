S E 0 R E&apos;T-.fl/T. 562. . .WAR CABINET.Operations.From:    F .M. C-in-C. France. 26/4/1917handed in at 12.42 a.m.To :      C.I.G.S.0.A.D.414.    25th. Your 33372^   of 25th.yesterday I saw Nivelle and discussed with him future orombined action.    He assured me that he will maintain offensive actively and we are in agreement as to plans.    If Nivelle is replaced by Petain, I understand,  it is doubtful whether latter would maintain vigorous offensive.    I am convinced that it woiald be a bad mistake if there was any relaxation of pressure.   Minister of War has to-day requested me to confer with him in Paris to-morrow.    I am complying with his request and will wire to you to-rnorrow night from Paris.^ repeating telegram No. 33371 addressed to Lt.-Gen. Sir Henry Wilson.
SECRET.OPERATIONS.From        General Wilson. 26/4/1917.To      :- Chief, London. Handed in 10.50 a.m.Received   11.47 a.m.No. 25.In continuation of my SC.24 the situation seems to me to be developing in a manner hostile to Nivelle; Ribot telegraphed last night asking Haig to come to Paris,  and he arrives Crillon at 3 o.clock this afternoon.It is my firm conviction that no action should be taken against Nivelle without our Government being consulted,  as change in Commander-in-Chief would probably result in change of plan. I will wire again after meeting is over.SECRET. OPERATIONS.From :- General Wilson. 25/4/1917.To C.I.G.S.. Handed in at 7.30p.m.3.C.    24.     Your 33371.I am in Paris and trying to  ind out the situation. Up to now nothing definite has been&apos; settled. I will wire you my opinion tomorrow.
From:- C.I.G.S. to Gen. Wilson.25/4/17. 2.15 p.m.33371 Cipher   25/4/17   2.25 p.m.It was as you know agreed at Paris last week that Nivelle&apos;s plan should he continued for a fortnight and that situation should then he reconsidered if necessary.   Bertie reports rumours that Senate Army Commission are perturbed at the alleged non-success of the French offensive and are asking that Petain should replace Nivelle.War Cahinet are therefore feeling douhtful as to whether Nivelle is being left free to carry out his plan and really means to prosecute it with the vigour originally intended. They ask me to obtain your definite opinion upon the sub-ject inasmuch as we are doing our full share as agreed upon and the Cabinet desires to be certain that the French mean to do theirs.    I have repeated this wire to Sir Douglas Haig and snail he glad to have an immediate reply from you.
