Colonel Knox, under date of 6th.April, writes that the Gouncil of Workingmen and Soldier deputies is exercising a very harmful influence on the army and is receiving addresses from units which are subversive of all discipline and authority.     For instance,the 109th Division, which was stationed on the right flank nearedRiga, has present&apos; a petition to the Council demanding the immediate commencement of peace negotiations between all the combatant Powers, the establishment of control by soldier deputies over the operations section of the Staff, the immediate election by universal secret ballot of a constituent assembly, the confiscation of land, an 8 hours day, and other measures.Since this address was presented the 109th Division, together with the 110th which was alongside it, have withdrawn from the line without orders, and have consequently uncovered Riga.On the Western Front, extending from Lake laroch to Kowel, things are but little better though General Gurko, who commands it, professes to take a favourable view of the outlook. A Colonel of the Guard Corps who returned to Petrograd last week told Colonel Knox that, though there had been no serious disorder in that Corps, he did not consider any offensive as now possible, as the officers had lost their authority over their men.Major Ihorrihill who was with the 10th Army near Molodetehno on the 17th instant states that in the End.Caucasian Corps a deputation headed by a 2nd.Lieutenant expressed lack of confidence in the Corps Commander and that the Commander of the division

Colonel Xnox, under date of 6th.April, writes that the Council of Workingmen and Soldier deputies is exercising a very harmful influence on the army and is receiving addresses from units which are subversive of all discipline and authority.     For instance,the 109th Division, which was stationed on the right flank nearedRiga, has present&apos; a petition to the Council demanding the immediate commencement of peace negotiations bet-ween all the combatant Powers, the establishment of control by soldier deputies over the operations section of the Staff, the immediate election by universal secret ballot of a constituent assembly, the confiscation of land, an 8 hours day, and other measures.Since this address was presented the 109th Division, together with the 110th which was alongside it, have withdrawn from the line without orders, and have consequently uncovered Riga,On the Western Front, extending from Lake Haroch to Kowel, things are but little better though General Gurko, who commands it, professes to take a favourable view of the outlook.

I 119from which this deputation came then committed suicide.     The Staff hope that matters may he put right in 6 weeks, hut the situation is not hopeful, as officers are afraid of punishing the men.     In this army no officers have been killed, but some have been forced to leave, usually because they were strict disciplinarians.     Three divisional commanders have resigned owing to votes of want of confidence passed by their men.The number of deserters is great and has been increased by the granting of an amnesty to those who return to their units by the 15th.May.     This amnesty has been interpreted by many as a permission to absent themselves till that date without fear of punishment.     Well informed officers believe that nothing but a German attack oan restore discipline in the army.     It would seem that if this vie?/ is correct the army may be destroyed before it regains its discipline.The evil influence of the Council of Workingmen and Soldier deputies is not confined to the army.     They have also assumed supervision, according to Sir C,Marling, of Russian services in Persia, and have suspended the Russian Consuls in that country, and are now examining the Russian legation in Teheran.In Turkestan the situation is disquieting.     General Europatkin has been arrested by his troops and there is reason to fear that disorder may spread into Afghanistan.In the Caucasus there have been mutinies at Sarikamish and other places, and General Baratoff with another General has been arrested at Baku for failing to recognise the local committee.German agitators and German money would seem to be having much to do with the unrest in Russia, and it is reported that the disturbances in Turkestan are largely due to Germans who have entered that country from Mongolia or who have been released from captivity in Siberia.General Staff, War Office,23r&amp;.April, 1917.
