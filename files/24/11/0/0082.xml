Report for Week ending Wednesday, April 25, 1917.PART I-ACTION  TAKEN.Orders and Regulations. By an Order iu Council dated the 20th April 1917 an additional regulation was inserted after Defence of the Realm Regulation 2g empowering the Food Controller to make orders whereby any factory, workshop, or premises in which any article of food as therein specified is manufactured or produced or adapted for sale shall pass into his possession. Where such an order is made, the occupier and staff of the premises, or in the case of a company, the directors, must comply with the directions of the Food Controller.The following Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations have been made by the Food Controller during the week : (1) Wheat, Eye, and Rice (Restriction) Order, 1917, dated April 20, 1917.-This Order prohibits the use of wheat or rye except for the purpose of seed or the manufacture of flour, and prohibits the use of rice, and flour obtained from wheat, rye. and rice, from being used after April 28, except for making articles suitable for and to be; used only for human food. From the same date none of the cereals mentioned must be so treated as to be rendered less fit for the purposes for which they are received under the Order. A further provision prohibits the waste of any of the flours mentioned, or any article containing such flour. (2) Flour Mills Order, 1917, dated April 20, 1917.-This Order applies asfrom April 30 the provisions of Regulation 2gq of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, as set out above, to all flour mills in the United Kingdom which, on the date of the Order, used wheat in the making of flour, except those the output capacity of which is less than five sacks of flour per hour. The Order gives the Government control of the flour supplies at their source. (3) Freshwater Fish (Ireland) Order, 1917, dated April 25, 19.17.-This Orde empowers the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland to authorise the taking of freshwater fish in Ireland notwithstanding that the methods authorised by the Departments Order would otherwise be&apos; unlawful. Salmon, sea trout, and pollan are not included in the definition of freshwater fish. .Control of Prices and Supplies.Cereals. As a result of the Flour Mills Order set out above, 80 per cent, of the total milling capacity of the country will pass into the Food Controller^ possession on the 30th instant. Lord Devonport has appointed a Mills Control Committee, with Lord St. Davids as its chairman.   The principal duties of this Committee will be (1) To regulate the quantities and qualities of admixtures to be used in each mill;(2) To control and fix the price at which flour is to be sold in the respective localities;(3) To frame a scheme on which the financial control of the mills can be based. (4) To regulate the distribution.of wheat and flour to and from the mills.Prior to&quot; the Wheat, Rye, and Rice (Restriction) Order, about 300,000 tons of flour (including a certain proportion.&quot; of wheaten flour), appear to have been used annually for industrial purposes, and about one-third of this total quantity to have been used in sizing, that is to say, in the preparation of yarns previous to weaving. A return of the stocks held by the sizing trade is being obtained before the issue of licences to use flour, notwithstanding the Order, is considered.Fish. A conference has been held between the Fish Food Committee and the Railway Executive Committee for the purpose of facilitating the transport of fish from Ireland with special reference to the prompt return of empties. The Food Controller is represented on the new committee which has been setup by the Secretary for Scotland for the purpose of dealing with the fish supply in that country. A circular letter with regard to pickled herrings has been sent out, and there already appears to be an increased demand for this article of food.&apos;4   (33)2795-3   Pk 1   40   4/17   B &amp; S A
Sugar. The issues of sugar in the week ending April 21 were not more than about 70 per cent, of the average maintained since the beginning of the year; but as the reduction was mainly on the supplies for manufacturing purposes, the effect on the general public will not be noticeable. Some increase in the stocks in hand has resulted, and the position now presents less cause for anxiety. Refineries are again working to their full capacity.Some further purchases of Cuban sugar have been made, and an adequate supply up to the end of July is assured, provided tonnage can be obtained.As regards supplies for the latter part of the year, it is now clear that, owing to the reduction in the 1917 crop of Cuban sugar, due to the recent internal troubles in Cuba, it will be necessary to draw to a substantial extent on Eastern sources (Java and Mauritius) much more so than was at one time hoped, and the tax upon available tonnage will be correspondingly increased.It is also becoming clear that the higher prices that from these causes are being-established in the world&apos;s sugar markets, may before long oblige the Sugar Commis-sion to raise the selling prices of sugar in the United Kingdom.The losses from submarines since February now amount to four vessels with cargoes (about 23,000 tons of sugar), and two vessels in ballast proceeding to load sugar.Food Economy.In the House of Lords on Wednesday, April 25, Lord Devonport emphasised the necessity for a reduced consumption of bread, and announced his decision to set up forthwith the necessary machinery for rationing so as to be prepared to deal with the distribution and supply of bread, sugar, and essential foodstuffs. He further announced that the voluntary sugar ration must be reduced from -f lb. to \ lb. per head per week.The Food Economy Campaign is being vigorously prosecuted, and good results are anticipated. The Public Meals Order has already effected a considerable saving in meal and flour, and the confectioners estimate that the Cake and Pastry Order with its provision for the rationing of tea-shops will greatly reduce public consumption. No figures are at present available.Enforcement of Orders.It has been arranged that the Local Government Board shall issue an order for the purpose of conferring and imposing on local authorities the powers and duties relating to the enforcement of a number of Orders made by the Food Controller. It is proposed to ask the Scottish and Irish Offices to issue similar Orders.The United Kingdom is being divided into districts, in each of which an inspector will be stationed for the purpose of seeing that the Food Controller^ Orders are obeyed.Reported contraventions of Orders are as follows : Price of Milk. The wholesale contractors who were reported to be selling-milk at &quot; accommodation milk &quot; prices to regular customers have been required to make returns. Probably this action will prevent any repetition of the offence. Similar returns have been required from a number of farmers in Sussex. The Eastern Counties Dairy Farmers Co-operative Society wras prosecuted for selling accommodation milk at an illegal price, and was fined 75L and costs.Potatoes. A number of prosecutions have been instituted with regard to unlawful sales, and in nearly every case conviction has followed, but with widely different penalties.Bread and Flour  A number of alleged contraventions of these Orders have been referred to inspectors for investigation, and the number of inspectors authorised to prosecute has been increased.Food (Conditions of Sale) Orders-This Order appears to have been infringed throughout the counhy, chiefly in connexion with the sale of sugar. Action has been and will be taken whenever the evidence is clear.Miscellaneous. Three cases of feeding wheat to cattle have been reported and referred to the police for investigation. Three cases of contravention of the Public Meals Order were reported and warnings have been given. Reports of alleged hoarding continue to be received, and the action usually taken is either to require some sort of legal evidence from the informant, or to make . the alleged hoarder submit returns. In the former case the informant is &quot;generally unable to prove his allegations. ;
PART IT.-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.Imports.The improvement in the imports of food, which Avas noted in the Report for last week, has not been wholly maintained, the total quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs imported (as shown in Table A.) having fallen to less than 205,000 tons in the week ended 21st April, compared with 222,000 tons in the previous week. Although this total is 5 per cent, above the weekly average since the beginning -of the year (195,000 tons), it is only slightly in excess of the quantity (199,000 tons) received in the corresponding week of 1916, which included Good Friday, and it is 11 per cent, below the average for the first 16 weeks of 1916 (nearly 230,000 tons).The articles mainly responsible for the decrease on the previous week are wheat, barley, mutton, margarine, butter, bacon, and maize. The imports of the first four of these were below the weekly average for .1917 up to date, but in the case of butter, bacon, and maize, the figures for the previous week had been unusually high, and the reduced quantities received were still above the average. The imports of sugar and oats showed large increases, though not sufficient to make up the deficiency caused by the heavy reductions in the previous week.The total imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs since the beginning of 1.917 now amount to nearly 3,119,000 tons, compared with 3,673,000 tons m the same period of last year a reduction of 554,000 tons, or 15 per cent. The principal decreases are in oats, 164,000 tons; barley, 147,000 tons; wheat, 129,000 tons; sugar, 129,000 tons, and wheaten flour 56,000 tons. The imports of meat (including pig-meat) are also slightly less than in 1916. Maize, cheese, butter, and lard, however, continue to show substantial increases.Consumption of Meat and Bread.Meat. The quantities of dead meat entering the markets in London, Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow (Table B.), in the week ended 14th April were much the same, in the aggregate, as in the previous week (which, however, included Good Friday). At Manchester, where supplies in the previous week had been exceptionally low, there was an appreciable increase, but this was partly balanced by decreases at Glasgow and Liverpool, and in London there was little change. Compared with the corresponding week in 1916, there were increases of 14 per cent, in London (where supplies were short in 1916) and 5 per cent, in Glasgow, and decreases of 11 per cent, in Manchester and 1-g- per cent, in Liverpool, the total for the four towns combined showing an increase of 10 per cent. In the first two weeks of April 1917, the average was slightly lower than in March.In the week ended 21st April, the supplies entering the London Central Market were somewhat greater than in the previous week, but 11 per cent, less than in the corresponding week of 1916 (which, however, included Good Friday).The supplies of fat stock received at 51 markets (Table C.) increased consider-ably during the week ended 18th April. The numbers of cattle and sheep were each 12 per cent, above those of the previous week and were 15 and 13 per cent, respectively above the weekly average for March.In the case of pigs, the increase was 27 per cent, on the previous week (affected by Easter) and 15 per cent, on the March average.Compared with the average for the corresponding week in 1914-16, there was an increase of 14 per cent, in fat cattle, but the numbers of sheep and pigs declined by 5 per cent, and 7 per cent respectively.. For the three weeks ended 18th April, the average weekly number of cattle is slightly above the average for March 1917, and considerably above the average for the same weeks of 1914-16; the wTeekly average for sheep and pigs, however, is perceptibly lower than in March 1917 or in the same period of 1914-16.Bread. Further returns have now been supplied by the National Association of Master Bakers and Confectioners as to the amount of flour used for.bread-making and confectionery by a number of the principal members of the Council of the Association. The figures relate to the four weeks ended 31st March 1917, and are in continuation of those summarised in the Report for the week ending 11th April, though only 25 of the 30 firms who then supplied returns have done so on this occasion. The total number of sacks of flour used by these 25 firms in the four weeks ended 31st March,
was 14,748-1-, against 14,081 in the four preceding weeks-an increase of nearly 5 per cent. Of the individual returns, 20 show increases and only five decreases. The previous returns had already indicated an increase of about 6 per cent, in consumption in February compared with January, and there would appear, therefore, to have been an increase of nearly 11 per cent, in March as compared with January 1917. Compared with the corresponding period of 1916, the figures for March show an increase of, roughly, 10 per cent, much of which may be ascribed to the shortage of potatoes.and to the influence of cold weather in increasing consumption^The returns furnished relate to large representative businesses, distributed over 20 towns, and may probably be accepted as providing an indication of the general trend of consumption. But in view of the small proportion of the whole baking trade which they cover, and of the wide variations between the figures given in the different returns, it would be unsafe to rely on the actual percentages given as measuring with any degree of accuracy the general increase in the consumption of bread and flour in the United Kingdom. Steps are accordingly being taken to obtain information, in future, from a much larger number of firms.Stocks.Wheat. The stocks of wheat and flour (as wheat) on 23rd April are estimated at 1,132,000 tons as compared with 1,159,000 tons at 16th April, and ],446,000 tons at the corresponding date in 1916. At the beginning of April the stocks were 1,237,000 tons.Barley. The estimated stocks (including those in maltsters&apos; hands, which are now available for use as human food) were 408,000 tons at 23rd April, compared with 444,000 tons at the beginning of the month.Oats.-The rapid fall in the stocks of oats has continued during the week ended 23rd April, the quantity at that date being estimated at 319,000 tons,, compared with 403,000 tons at 16th April and 584,000 tons at the beginning of the month.Maize. The stocks at 23rd April are estimated at 15.1,000 tons, compared with 153,000 tons a week previously and with 163,000 tons at the beginning of April.Wholesale Prices.The principal changes in the latest wholesale prices of food and feeding-stuffs (Table II), compared with those for the preceding week, are marked increases in the prices of palm kernels (47s. a ton) and palm kernel cake (33s. a ton), and decreases of 10s. Qd. and 11s. per cwt. respectively in the prices of Danish and New Zealand butter, and of 6s. per cwt. in Argentine chilled beef. There were-also advances of 20s. a ton in Egyptian cottonseed and in linseed cake, 10s. a ton in cottonseed cake, 6s. a quarter in Calcutta linseed, 2s. Qd. per 312 lbs. in the Gazette average price of British oats, 2s. Qd. per cwt. in Argentine mutton, 2s. and 2s. Qd. per cwt. respectively in Irish and Canadian bacon, and Is. Qd. a sack in &quot; country straight run &quot; flour (in London);&apos; and small reductions in the prices of British barley and wheat, English-beef and mutton, and Danish bacon. Imported wheat, rice, the new war flour (in London), cheese, aud sugar showed no change.Compared with a month ago, the prices of palm kernels and Calcutta linseed are higher by 50s. and 43s. a ton respectively, and those of Egyptian cotton seed, linseed cake, cottonseed cake, and palm kernel.cake by 13s. to 30s. per ton. Argentine mutton has risen by 10s. Qd. per cwt., British oats by 9s. 4d. per 312 lb., British barley by 5s. per 400 lb., British wheat by 4s. 7d. per 480 lb., and country straight run flour (London) by 3s. Qd. per sack. Imported wheat, new war flour (London), rice, English beef, bacon, and English cheese are also dearer. New Zealand butter, on the other hand, is cheaper by 18s. per cwt., Argentine beef by 8s. Qd. per cwt., and English mutton and Canadian cheese are each Is. per cwt. lower.The increases since the corresponding week in 1916, which affect every commodity in the list except English refined cube sugar, have been greatest with palm kernel cake (163s. per ton, or 115 per cent.), British oats (28s. per 312 lbs., or 88 per cent.), linseed cake (176s. per ton, or 73 per cent.), linseed (48s. a quarter, or 64 per cent.), British wheat (29s. Id. per 480 lb., or 54 per cent.), rice (9s. 9d. per cwt., or 52 per cent.), Canadian cheese (55s. per cwt., or 52 per cent.), and English Cheddar cheese (53s. per cwt., or 47 per cent.). The price of &quot; country straight run &quot; flour in London is 24s. per sack (or 57 per cent.) above that of &quot; country white &quot; flour a
syear ago, and the new &quot;war &quot; flour in London is 13s. per sack (27 per cent.) dearer that was London &quot;town hpuseholds &quot;at that date. There have, also been advances of 33 per cent. (17s. Sd. per 400 lb.) in English barley, 29 per cent. (26s. per cwt.) in English beef and Argentine mutton, 28 to 37 per cent. (30s. to 37s. per cwt.) in Irish, Danish, and Canadian bacon, 24 per cent. (39s. per cwt.) in New Zealand butter, 20 per cent. (34s. 6d. per cwt.), in Danish butter, 20 per cent. (16s. per cwt.), in Argentine chilled beef, and 16 per cent (17s. Qd: per cwt.) in English mutton.The tea sold in public auction in London last week realised prices which, were somewhat higher than at the previous sales (in the week ended 6th April) and much above those of a year ago, &quot;but it is reported that a considerable cpiantity, especially of the less expensive teas, was allocated to buyers without passing through the auctions, under the arrangements recently concluded for the maintenance of a supply of cheap tea to the public. In these circumstances it has been thought better to omit the averages of all prices at auction formerly given in the Table and to retain only the predominant ranges of price which are probably less affected.
