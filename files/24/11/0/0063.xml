Situated as it is at the Southern end of tho Red Sea dominating the Island of PERIM and the small Straits of EL MANDEB, this &quot;small Peninsula of SHEIKH SAID assumes an rtance out of all proportion to its size or value, since its ipation cannot but affect the safety of the sea route.     Its nato fate therefore cannot be a matter of indifference to ilaval Authorities. .      At the commencement of the war our policy seems to been directed towards attempting to gain the principal Arab iers over to our side, with a view to their ultimately driving Turks out of their territories;   or, should this not succeed, persuading them to maintain neutrality.3.      This was the attitude adopted by us towards the HYEHIA of the YEMEN, who lays hereditary claim to this territory.4.      When in the Autumn of 1914 the Turkish forts situatedSHEIKS SaID were attacked and dismantled by our forces, the^YEEIA protested against this action as an act of hostility tfds him, thereby implying his neutrality.5.      Though the Turks subseauently re-armed the place and again, in Juno 1915, shelled PERIM Island, putting the Chouse out of action, no steps were taken by us against the -beyond once more silencing the guns.     No occupation was snpted for the reason, it is understood, that the French Jt advance some prior claim founded on their purchase, in ff r days, of certain interests from a local Sheik.6.      In order to safeguard our interests, there would there-appear to be but two slternatives for dealing v/ith this stion, viz:-(a) An actual occupation of the territory, or(b) A treaty with a Ruler strong enough to maintain his position and to guarantee it against any form of disposal to a Foreign Power.
-2-7. IMAM YSHIA has preserved as neutral en attitudeUards us as could he expected, considering that the enemy bains unmolested hy us, not only in his own country, hut (so in our territory he fore ADSI;   and so lately ago as last [cember he wrote to the Political Resident at ADEN refottIvq the &quot;regard of his ancestors for the   great British G-ovcrn-kt&quot;, etc., and it is thought that when the tide has more Ifiously turned against the Turks he may oven take more Jtive measures against them.\ 8.      Under these circumstances, it may      well he that he hid refuse to enter into any such treaty as described, and Lht even claim consideration from us for his previous Ititude.     Unless such a treaty can now he forced upon him,seems as though actual occupation were the only satisfactory Inrae open to us.9,       I fully realise that the question is one of political Insideration;   hut the position of the territory makes it l3c a matter of Ifaval importance, and I am therefore led to present my views to Their Lordships now before any further Isps are taken in the matter which might prove contrary ilaval interests.I am etc (sd)   E.
