On March 1st the War Cabinet, approved a suggestion  con-tained in a report by Sir Henry Babington Smith that an Inter-department Committee should be convened by the President of the Board of Trade &quot;to consider economies in the use of grain for horses, and to direct a census of horses&apos;^I accordingly convened a Committee, representing the various departments concerned, with Mr. R.H.Selbie, as Chair-man.   The Committee held their first meeting March 19th, and presented a preliminary report to me on April 3rd, in which it was stated that the preliminary arrangements for the taking of a Census of Horses had been completed.   On their recommen-dation    and at the request of the Board of Trade the War haveOffice/now made an Order under the Defence of the Bealm Regu-tions making it incumbent upon all owners of horses in Great Britain .to make a return not later than May 1st on the prescrib-ed form.In view of the amount of work entailed in summarising the forms after they are received, it is not expected that the results will be ready for use for several weeks.In the Ci.se of Ireland, it has not been found possible to expedite arrangements to the same extent as in Britain, but it is proposed that the Census of Horses shall be taken along with the customary Agricultural Beturns at the begin-ning of June.The Committee further reported that they had under con-sideration the question of a compulsory rationing of horses in respect on grain, but that meanwhile in view of the urgent necessity for economy, it was desirable that a public appeal should be m de to all owners of horses, not to feed their horses more than certain rations of grain which are particular-ised for different classes of horses.   At the requestof theBoard
Board of Trade, the Pood Controller has undertaken to deal with the matter.   In a further interim report on April 16th Mr. Selbie states that ho has held meetings with represcnta-tives of some of the largest stores and shops in London, and that at the second of thoue meetings, held on April 16th, a Resolution was unanimously passed, embodying an agreement on behalf of the firms represented to place at the disposal of the Army authorities 25% of their horses engaged in the work of distributing goods to purchasers, conditionally upon other retail firms being similarly dealt with.   It is pro-posed, therefore, that tho War Office shall proceed at once, under the powers vested in them, to requisition suitable horses, within the limits named above, from retail distribu-ting firms.    Other businesses and interests which are large owners of horses are also being approached,A. H, S.Board of Trade,19th April, 1917.
