fMINISTRY OF PENSIONS- 3/REPORT for period from 21st April to 27th April 1917The number of permanent pensions which have been ssessed under the Nev* Warrant has been ascertained to be 902,     The work of revising temporary (conditional) pension which are not due to expire until the year 1918 so as to bring them into accord with the provisions of the Warranty has now been commenced.     The conditional cases due for consideration as to renewal this year are dealt with asI    X        vthey come up for that consideration with effect from    [\ April 4th;     7692 cases have been so dealt with,     770 gratuities have been awarded in non attributable and non-aggravated cases.The reassessment of widows&apos; pensions, undertaken in the manner previously indicated, will be completed by the end of June.   That of dependants pensions presents more difficulty and is proceeding more slowly.   As shqwn by Appendix I only 1862 cases have been dealt with out of a total of some 75,000 but the work is proceeding with In-creasing velocity and the result of arrangements that have novf been made for doubling the staff engaged on it will be manifest in future reports.   In rather more than half of the 1130 cases dealt with in the past week, the rate of pension is unchanged being already equal to pre-war depend-encej     In the remainder the increased benefit arising from the new Warrant averages 3/lOd a week.Appendix II shows that out of 4^523 cases in which claims have been rejected for lack of entitlement to pension under old v-arrants, 1,322   have been re-examinedup
3 A 1   -up to date.   In 618 bf these cases widows have now been given life pensions under Article 11, or short pensions under Article 15 of the Warrant, while in 264 aggravation (gratuity) cases life pensions have been granted,     404 dependants have been admitted to pension or gratuity while only in 36 cases has it been found impossible to alter previous decisions.340 grants of  3 on notification of death have been made during the week.   The casualties arising from the offensive which began Qtt Easter are beginning to come in,2, A further revision of the draft Warrant for the retiredpay of officers disabled, and for the pensions of the families   of officers deceased, and for the pensions of nurses disabled in consequence of the present War, was prepared, and has been submitted unofficially to the Government Actuary and the Treasury for examination.3, Ad interim arrangements have been made for dealing withalternative pensions pending the issue of instructions to Local Committees under the new Warrant and Order in Council for men.   It is hoped that these instructions as well as those with regard to treatment and training will very shortly be ready for issue.   Those dealing with the provi-sion of training are at present under discussion with the Ministry of Labour.   It is felt to be essential that they should be so framed as to remove the possibility of an unduly large number of men being trained, after possibly short periods of apprenticeship, to skilled trades with a results ing risk of a surplus of labour in this or that trade.   The necessity for caution in this direction requires that, while the Local Committee should not be hampered in securing training for individual cases, any large schemes of technical training must be scrutinized from the point of view of theinterests
interests of the trade as a whole.   The section of thesame Instructions dealing with medical treatment is nowbeing considered in conjunction with the Local GovernmentBoard and the Insurance Commissioners so as to make certainthat the necessary treatment will be secured in all casesat tho time that it is needed;     this especially applies .to cases of tuberculosis.4,        The Kaval and Military &quot;far Pensions (Administrativeexpenses) Bill passed through Committee and Report stagesin the House of Lords on the 26th and 26th instant.   Two   -amendments of importance were inserted.1. A clause was proposed by the Government to enablethe Minister of Pensions to accept gifts of money orsecurities to be applied for the purpose of assistingdisabled officers and men or the dependants, widows andchildren of officers and men.   The Minister of Pensionshad been offered the sum of  20,000 to be disposed ofby way of grants in aid for the starting of new institu-tions for srecial forms of treatment and further sumshave been promised for the same object.It is considered that voluntary funds which havebeen raised to a very large amount for providing eitherspecial institutions or special forms of assistance mayoften be more usefully applied through the Ministry thanthrough outside organisation, which in the nature ofthe case would have less information as to the directionin which such funds can best be applied.2. The Government also accepted a clause moved by LordCrewe making it obligatory on the London County Councilto submit a scheme for the setting up;of Districtand the CityCommittees for Metropolitan Boroughs of/vLondon within six months after the termination of the ?7ar and for the operation of the scheme being conditional on the MinisterOf
of Pensions being satlsfe-id tlisrt. Uae of &quot;theLocal -Committee for London were not thereby unduly&quot; &amp;ls-turbed,   This amendment was the result of an agreement Between the London County Council and the London Local Committee on the one hand and the Metropolitan Borough Councils on the other,A copy of the Bill as it now stands is annexed as Appendix III to this report.The Bill to amend the enactments relating to National Health Insurance with reference to persons suffer-ing from disablement in consequence of the present War, referred to in paragraph 4 of the report of the 5th April passed through the Committee of the House of Commons, and on the 27th instant was read a third time there without amendment.Cases have from time to time been brought to the notice of the Statutory Committee and the Ministry of Pensions of discharged disabled men being obliged to resort to the Poor Law Infirmaries and two instances were quoted in a recent letter from Sir Sidney Lee in the &quot;Times&quot;.     The Local Government Board have now been asked to circularise all Boards of Guardians Instructing them to communicate with their Local War Pensions Committees in regard to any such cases that may be in their Institutions with a view to securing the man&apos;s removal from the poor-law administration or to the provision of such other assistance as he may require.    Boards of Guardians will also be asked to refer any discharged disabled man who In future applies to them for assistance to the Local War Pensions Committee.     As a corollary to this, the Minister of Pensions will cause the Local Committees themselves to be notified of the steps taken by the Local Government Board and will be instructed to make arrange-ments for the men There
There is no doubt that some of the cases of discharged men in Work .iouse Infirmaries are cases which have been refused a pension on the ground that their disability is neither due to nor aggravated by War Service.   These cases will, of course, under the new Warrant be awarded a gratuity but where they are such as require prolonged medical treatment in an Institution there Is some likelihood of their being obliged again to have recourse to Workhouse Infirmaries, since Article 6 of the Warrant provides for treatment at the expense of the Ministry only in cases of men who are in receipt of a pension.   It has been decided of course that these cases cannot be put on the same footing as regards pension as those whose injury or disease is found to be attribu-table to or aggravated by War Service, but the Minister believes that any grievance they&apos; have would be substan-tially met by the provision of institutional treatment for those who need it.     Home treatment is already secured for them under the Insurance Act through the panel doctor, but the Insurance Act does not provide institutional treatment.   The provision of institutional treatment for these cases needs special Treasury sanction for which the Minister has applied,A statement of the work of the Statutory Committee for the week ending the 25th instant is annexed as Appendix IV,It refers to satisfactory reports received fromthe Statutory Committee&apos;s Inspectors with regard to thework of the Committees at Burton-on-Trent, Chester, Ripon/Blackpool and Preston;     These committees recognise andeffectively carry out their duty of getting into touchwith ai-: assisting to get suitable employment for dis-charged soldiers,       The Committee at Barnsley and thesub-committees of the County of Oxford apparently neglectthis duty.   The Hornsey Committee and others still dwelltn
on the unsatisfactory way in which the War Office arc deal inn; with men of Class vi. reserve.8,      *      The training and employment section of the Disablc-ment Committee- of the Statutory Committee at their mooting on tho 27th instant empowered their Chairman - Mr. J.S. Nicholson of the Ministry of Labour, to use his discretion in acting on tho reports of Local Committees, and approving schemes without waiting, for meetings of tho section, his action in each case to be reported at the next meeting. It is hoped in this way expoditlously to deal with tho growing number of schemes submitted to tho section of, which an indication is given in the list which forms Appendix V to this report.     The connection between the Section and the Ministry of Pensions has boon strengthened by the Parliamentary Secretary attending its meetings, and by the assistance of Mr. IToro, A&amp;sistant Secretary, and Major Mitchell, Advisor on Training, boinr given to Mr. Nicholson. 9* At the mooting of tho Training Section held on the27th instant, the position of the Joint Committees which arc bolnr sot up by the Minister of Pensions for ensuring that tho greatest advantage is dorived from the training and treatment facilities within their wide areas was discussed, and it was decided that tho Joint Committees should bo advisory bodies, that oheir recommendations as regards Train-ing schemes should be made to the Statutory Committee and Pensions Ministry through the Training Section of the former body and that correspondence with regard to schemes of train-ing should bo, in tho first instance, conducted by that Section with Local Committees, arrangements bo in-; made to ensure the Joint Committoo having full cognisance of all approved schemes within thoir area so that they can make them available to Local Committees other than that of thelocality
locality where the scheme is located, 346Appendix VI gives a list of the Joint Committees for Treatment and Training that have so far been set up. As regards the latter negotiations with representatives of the Local Committees may lead to some modification before the areas are finally settled. . In this connection meetings were held on the 24th instant, by the Pensions Minister with representatives of the Local Committees in Middlesex and Essex, and with representatives of the Local Committees .in Kent, Surir^yand Sussex;   on the 25th instant by the Parliamentary Secretary with those o&amp; the Local Committees in Hampshire and Berkshire; . and on the 26th by the Minister with those of Local&apos; Committees in Huntingdon, Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire. 10, A copy of an important circular of the StatutoryCommittee dated the 20th instant on the subject of the Trade Advisory Boards referred to in paragraph 6 of the Report of the 16th March annexed as Appendix VII nere-to,11. At the eighth meeting of the Committee on ,Institutional Treatment held on the 23rd instant, Sir John Collie reported that the Home for 100 neurasthenic patients at Highfield, Golders Green, would be ready for 10 cases on May 3rd, and that there were 81 men waiting to enter the Home,     A similar institution for 50 Ulster neurasthenics was proposed to be established at Captain Craig&apos;s house near Belfast, and the question of an orthopaedic hospital for discharged men at the same place was discussed but not finally agreed to. Dr. Bond reported delay in the building of accommoda-tion for 100 epileptic cases at Chalfont, St. Giles, and the arrangements made for dealing with cases in various colonies pending the completion of this building.      He referred to the proposed &quot;boarding51of
of all epileptic cases in London to enable him to get into personal touch with them.     The.Committee consider-ed the instructions with regard to treatment under the new Royal Warrant referred to in paragraph 3 above. 12. The War Office have, informed the PensionsMinistry that in conjunction with the Red Cross Society they contemplate the starting of a Journal, probably quarterly and edited by Lord Charnwood., to deal with questions of treatment and training so that institutions for these purposes all over the country may be informed: of what others are doing and of all new.developments in the United Kingdom, or on the Continent,     The financial co-operation of the Ministry has been asked for and is under consideration.In the meantime a small monthly &quot;War Pensions Gazette&quot; of which the first number is Appendix VIII hereto, has been started by the Statutory Committee to give official rulings and decisions on points of difficulty in any matters dealt with by that Committee or by the Ministry, to furnish opportunity of un-official criticism and discussion and to contain in-formation on the work of Local Committees, Technical Institutions, etc.   The Journal is intended mainly to spread information among members of Local Committees with regard to matters of growing importance with which they have to deal. 13. Table I shows that 10,992 new pensions includingchildren&apos;s allowances were granted during the week, against 10,727 during the previous week, and 7,387 in the week before that.   The number includes 3,273 disabled men - a considerable increase on previous figures.      606,406 pensions including children1s allowances have been granted since the beginning of the Uar up to the 25th instant. Table
Table II shows that last week     176 grants of supple-mentary pensions and children1s allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 173 in the previous week, and that the total number to date is 3609,Table III shows only a small increase in the staff of the Ministry in the past week.     This was mainly in the award to dependants branch, and was made for the reason given in para I above.   The Staff now numbers 179 men and 2,622 women, or 2,801 In all.   That of the Statutory. Committee consists of 100 men, (includ-ing 13 Commissionaires and messengers not previously reported) and 165 women or 265 in all, bringing the grand total to 3066.The staff of officers making avfards of soldiers pensions has been increased by the addition of one disabled military officer giving a total of 5 such officers in addition to the six original award officers.The first block of the new building in the Duke of York&apos;s headquarters with accommodation for some 400 clerks has been completed and will be occupied on the 30th instant, much overcrowding being thereby relieved.   The additional rooms at the Tate Gallery were occupied on the 21st,There has been a slight further reduction in the sick absence percentage of the female staff at Tate Gallery from 9,4 to 8.     At Chelsea, this percentage has gone down from 7 to 6,6 and at the Pension Issue Office from 8,8 to 8,5.       The total daily percentage of absences from the Ministry was 1,4 among the male and 7,7 among the female staff.April 28th 1917

As regards discharged and disabled sailors and soldiers, by agree-ment with the Local Committee, the Labour Exchange sent a circular to every discharged disabled man asking him to call at the Exchange if he wanted work.     By this means close on 200 of the 240 disabled men notified have been placed.     The Committee are administering treatment to two ftr three cases, Practically all tbfi men placed have been fQund situations in breweries.Ylith reference to Monk Bretton Sul)-Committeef West Riding, Yorkshire, he states that all discharged, men are colliers and prefer getting back to their old pits, sometimes at a lower T/age.than formerly, but with the pensions they are receiving, very few are worse off than before the \?ar.     Every case is investigated and with Members of the&apos; colliery firms on the Committee, no case- is likely to. be overlooked.Our Inspector reporting ofi. Chester Looal Committee states he is very, satisfied with the v/ork of this Committee, both in principle and practice.     Local employers have been approached on the subject of training of disabled men and have?rOmised when required to give their assistance and co-operatiCh. his Committee observes the Regulations carefully and grants  re made with judicious discrimination.Our Inspector reporting on Wallasey Local Committee states that at the-meeting of the Sub-Committee, mainly or/ing . to.the activity of the Labour representatives, assistance was in the great majority of cases somewhat indiscriminately given but as these were without exception assisted from local funds,, he raised no pretost.     The Regulations were rigidly observed in all cases Involving the funds of .the Statutory Committee.With reference to the Ripon Sub-Committee, our Inspector reports that all cases of discharged soldiers are visited, as sown as reported,  . Some&apos;20 cases have been attended tc.so far, mostly farm labourers. - /ITo training has been necessary, they go back&apos; to their old work and with the pensions they are receiving aro better off than formerly.Our Inspector reporting on Blackpool local Committee, states thai; discharged men have been--satisfactorily dealt with. An effort is made to get into touch with all-men discharged and there is considerable trouble taken to obtain suitable employment.Appendix IV..
Reporting on Preston Looal Committee, our Inspector states that the Committee is fortunate in including one cr two large employers of labour Y/ho are able and willing to find work for men who would otherwise be stranded.Reporting on Oxfordshire Local Committee, our Inspector states that the whole of the County is worked from the local Office at Oxford,     Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire are formulating a joint schemo in respect cf disabled men but unless something more is done in the way of local Sub-Committees in the County of Oxford, the disabled men will never be heard of.Reporting on Barnsley Local&apos;Committee, our Inspector states as regards discharged soldiers, this part of the work is badly neglected, no case beirg investigated unless an application is received and very few have so far applied. There is no staff to cope with the work, ?/hich is considerable, Our Inspector asked tho Secretary to pay more attention to this important side of the work and he realised the necessity of doing sooThe following letter from the Secretary ox the Hornsey Local Committee is typical of othera we have received, in connection with the very unsatisfactory state of affairs that exists in respect of men transferred by the War Office to the Class W.

I am directed by the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee to state that the Minister of Labour, acting in conjunction with the Statutory Committee, * is setting up Trade Advisory Committees in each of several industries or trade groups, to advise upon various questions that concern the training and employment of disabled sailors and soldiers;Each Trade Advisory Committee will consist of an equal number of employers and workpeople nominated by their respective Associations. The Chairman will usually be appointed by the Committee, but if they do not agree upon a Chairman he will be appointed by the Minister of Labour.A representative of the Statutory Committee and of the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour respectively will be authorised to attend the meetiugs of the Trade Advisory Committee in a consultative capacity.The functions of a Trade Advisory Committee as regards any particular trade will be as follows : (a) To advise as to all questions that affect the re-instatement into employmentof disabled men formerly employed in the trade.(b) To make enquiries and to advise with regard to the possibility of thepermanent employment of disabled men not hitherto working in the trade.(c) To report upon any scheme of training either in technical institutes or infactories that may be necessary for disabled men, whether formerly employed in the trade or not, and to give advice as to suitable centres throughout the country in which such training might be given.(d) To advise upon any general questions with regard to the rate of wages to bepaid to disabled men in the trade.It should be noted that these Trade Advisory Committees will deal only with national industries, and will not be set up in the case of industries which are confined to only one town or to a small area.In such cases it will be open to any Local Committee to set up, if they so desire, a small panel of Employers and Trade Unionists to advise with regard to the local industry, but it is suggested that before doing so the Local Committee should communicate with the Statutory Committee in order to avoid an)&apos; possibility of overlapping.The value of - the Trade Advisory Committees to the Local Committees will be obvious : 1. Many instances have occurred where a Local Committee have found that the local Employers&apos; Association or Trade Union branch concerned are unable to make an agreement affecting the conditions of entrance, wages, &amp;c, of disabled sailors and soldiers without consulting their National bodies. Any such matters can in future be readily referred to the Trade Advisory Committee who are representative of the industry as a whole and who will be in close touch with the local Advisory Wages Boards set up in twenty large towns by the Ministry of Labour.2. It is of great importance to guard against the danger that an undue proportion of disabled men may be trained by means of public funds for any particular trade. Reports from various Local Committees who wish to train men in any given trade will be laid before the Trade Advisory Committee covering the trade in question. This Committee will be in the best position to advise as to the numbers of men that may safely be so trained.(10947.)  Wt.         G 377.  7500.  4/17.   D &amp; s.

3. The Trade Advisory Committee will be able, from their intimate knowledge of a particular trade, to advise as to the kind of training needed, and the appropriate local centres where such training should be given, and to forward suggestions to Local Committees with regard to the setting up of training centres.4. Where requests are made by Local Committees to the Statutory Committee to sanction the training of men in factories and workshops, it is most desirable that the advice of the trade as a whole should be given through the Trade Advisory Committee with regard to the suitability and duration of such training, as well as on the question of the wages to be paid after training.o. Experience has shown that it is of great importance to interest the trade as a whole in the question of the training of disabled men. It is a new departure in this country for adult men to be trained at the expense of the State to enter a fresh trade, and it is eminently desirable that this should only be done under the advice and with the concurrence of the trade as a whole.ft will be of great assistance to the Statutory Committee if Local Committees will send up to the Trade Advisory Committees Branch (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers) at (he address given below any cases in which the reinstatement of disabled men has been or is expected to be difficult owing to their particular disabilities.The Trade Advisory Committees in the Cane and Willow and Basket Industry and in connection with the Electricity Sub-Station Attendants have already held their first meetings. Similar Committees have been set up in the Boot and Shoe, the Clothing (Wholesale and Retail), and the Cinema Industries.The Statutory Committee will inform Local Committees from time to time of the formation of other Trade Advisory Committees.All communications with reference to these Committees should be addressed to the Ministry of Labour, Trade Advisory Committee Branch (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers), Employment Department, Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, London, S.W. 1.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,E.

2THE WAE PENSIONS GAZETTE.May, 191?Editorial Notes..-o-         ;Although the foreword which the Minister of Pensions has been kind enough to contribute to our first number, states briefly the object for which the &quot; War Pensions Gazette &quot; has been started, it may be well to set out in greater detail the policy which it is proposed to follow,, and the general rules upon which the &quot;Gazette&quot; has been planned. Many Soldiers&apos; &amp; Sailors&apos; Families Associa-tion workers will remember the County meetings in the early days, at which members from various centres had an opportunity of comparing notes and discussing difficulties. These meetings enabled those who were actually engaged in the work from day to day to dis-cover in what ways their methods differed from those of their neighbours and to compare the different solutions of common difficulties. The work has now grown to such dimensions that local meetings no longer afford a sufficient opportunity for discussion, but it is hoped that the &quot; Gazette &quot; will provide a medium for the exchange of ideas and the pooling of experience among all those interested.Our Object.When the project of founding this magazine was first mooted, various experienced ^workers were asked for their suggestions. The first to reply wrote &quot; I hope the venture will be entirely free from official control, otherwise it may possibly lose a good deal of its interest and value.&quot; By the next post came a letter which said &quot; If your magazine could have behind it real authority ! If it could be a real official document, whose ridings and decisions could be considered by the many Committees as final, it would allay much anxiety of mind.&quot;There really ought to be no difficulty in satisfying these apparently conflicting demands. One of the most important features of the &quot; Gazette &quot; will be answers to correspondents, in whieh it is proposed to deal with any points of difficulty which appear to be of general interest, and needless to say, the rulings and decisions published in answer to such questions may be regarded as official. For the rest, it is hoped that contributors will write with the utmost frankness, and the most-vigorous criticism will be welcomed, sprovided it is based on knowledge, and experience. The Statutory Committee have never lacked candid friends who have pointed out how far the regulations and instructions are from perfection, but too few of these kindly critics have ever suggested any practical remedy for the matters of which they complain. If any War Pension workers are in any sort of difficulty or have any suggestions to offer either as to the Regulations or Instructions or for the improvement of administrative methods the Editor will be glad to hear from them, and as far as possible, submit the suggestions for public discussion in the &quot; Gazette.&quot; Shortage of paper limits the space available, and we hope that all contributors will write as briefly and clearly as possible, and will bear in mind that the more obvious difficulties are well-known to the Statutory Committee, and to all Local Committees, and need not be set out at any   length.It is proposed that all contributions should be sigr The Local Committees and the Statutory Commi are working together for one object, and one obj only, and there will, generally speaking, be no real for anonymity.    Signed articles are of much great general interest.Some Features of the Gazette.Among-the regular items in the &quot; Gazette&quot; willl Notes of the Month, in which attention will be dm] to any official instructions issued during the rnonj New circulars and regulations will be commented and briefly explained. Any decisions of gene! interest will be noted. It is hoped in this way that tj &quot; Gazette &quot; may be the means of saving a considevaJ amount of correspondence between the Statute] and the Local Committees. In addition to the Nofl of the Month, there will be short reviews of any puUiJ tions or articles of interest to pension workers.The future of the &quot; Gazette &quot; will depend LogJ upon the use made of its columns by those of c readers who are devoting their energies to the admhj tration and improvement of the war pensions syste They have first-hand knowledge, and it is to the that we shall look for ideas and suggestions, promptt by their daily experience of the needs of the disabl-and the dependent.The oidy concern of us all is to cany out, to the be of our ability, the great trust which has been laid up us, and if this &quot; Gazette &quot; can be of help to Local Coi mittees, and to the individual worker upon whom t! ultimate burden rests, it will have achieved its object.Monthly Notes.-o-This Eegulation is designed to remove the existij hardship whereby, in certain cases, the wife or depend?.of a sailor receives less than the w Regulation     or dependent of a private soldi 7 (1) (g).

Expenditure under t head on the part of Local Committe will, therefore, be restricted in future to payments dependants and to those widows who are not eligib

(T.) Reserve men, fflass W. which takes the place of Circular 31. Men. It will be noted in the new Circular that a man transferred to Class W. jtes from the War Office pay and allowances for the (seven days of his transfer to this Reserve, and ler, that after the 1st of February, 1917, all men (fared to this reserve will have been carefully lily examined, thereby precluding any erroneous ller, and the necessity for further medical boards. ! Committees have complained of the insufficiency Ms. a week maximum allowance, and asked the itory Committee to raise this figure, but it is for-L that men in Class W. or W.(T.), or (T.) Reserve jot be assisted from Statutory Committee Funds ley are not discharged soldiers, and the amount of jiranfc was fixed by the War Office. Local Com-les are asked by the War Office to act as their Is in the matter. A further concession has now [obtained from the War Office, who have agreed to fine pay and separation allowances for one week after n&apos;s transfer.-o-.e Leicestershire Local Committee have adopted a for the treatment and training of disabled men and then- dependants. The Committee A are anxious to compile a completeicestershire register, not only of those who may Scheme. need advice and assistance, but also of all officers and men who have been lor disabled in the&apos;war, for the purpose of County Dry. In obtaining such information, it is intended ivite the co-operation of the Principals of schools, y school in the County, secondary or elementary, its Roll of Honour. The scheme further provides the compilation of a County Roll of Employers and :he appointment of an Advisory Board to deal with individual case. Industrial and agricultural train-and medical treatment aie three subjects dealt with ie memorandum.-o-lie Dumfriesshire Local Committee forward an (resting memorandum from Principal Paterson on the training of disabled sailors and soldiers in rural occupations. Apart from the nature of the man&apos;s disability, stress is laid upon the necessity of meeting the natural preference of the iridual as far as possible. The financial position of man, apart altogether from his earning capacity, is a ^important factor. It is perhaps seldom sufficiently feed that to make a proper start on the land requires, most cases, substantial capital outlay. The ad van-is of various forms of employment are. discussed, for&quot; Milk iRecorders.&quot;which special local facilities exist at the^West of Scotland Agricidtural Farm. These include Bee Keeping, Poultry Keeping, Pig Feeding, Vegetable, Fruit and Flower Culture, Nursery and Forestry work, small Holdings, and branches of Dairying. In respect of the last item, an interesting statement is made that an increasing number of openings are available as &quot; Milk Recorders,&quot; as farmers are now more alive to the advantages of systematic recording. It only necessitates a short course of instruction, but is probably not suitable for older men owing to the constant moving from place to place.- o-In view of the fact that before the war is over there will be thousands of soldiers suffering from the loss.of a foot, or maimed in one or other of A New their legs, it may be of interest to Bicycle. know that, according to an article in &quot; Chamber&apos;s Journal &quot; for April, a bicycle has been designed which on account of being fitted with foot-levers, may be ridden by men who could not operate an &quot;ordinary crank machine. The driving power is applied by means of two levers working inde-pendently, the length of each stroke varying according to requirements. Thus a man minus one foot, or with one leg shorter than the other, could operate the bicycle with ease. A further advantage consists in varying leverages, or speed-gears, ranging from forty to eighty, fifty to one hundred, etc. A machine of this description may also be ridden by any one over ten years of age, as any length of stroke may be taken, according to length of reach. On mounting, the levers are always hi one definite position, ready to take a stroke with either foot. Chain-wheel troubles are eliminated, owing to the absence of chains, and gear-wheels. The lever principle of propulsion as applied to bicycles is, of course, no.new idea, but as embodied in the above machine offers particular advantages never before combined. The appliance is not yet on the market; but in view of the particular uses above suggested, its manufacture should be made possible even in war-time. Some such device must be looked on as a necessity if men disabled in the ways referred to above are to be able to get about and find employment.Canada&apos;s Gift.Canada has given proof of her real appreciation of the magnificent work of our sailors by sending a gift of  50,000 for the assistance of naval hospitals, orphanages and charities.voluntary funds.The total amount received to date by the Statutory Committee in respect of voluntary contributions amounts to  11,489 13s. 7d.
4THE WAR PENSIONS GAZETTE.May, 1917Local Committees at Work.-0-No. 1. Leicester. : o-The Leicester Local Coramittee, at the time they com-menced to administer the Naval &amp; Military War Pensions, &amp;c, Act, 1915, were fortunate in being able to retain.the paid staff, and without exception, the excellent trained voluntary workers who had done splendid and self-sacrificing work in the service of the National Relief Fund. The same offices continued to be occupied, and all the records, etc., were transferred. The organisation had, to some extent to be overhauled. Discretion to give grants on application was taken away altogether. Recoverable advances of a small amount only were permitted, and not until a visit to the home and to the Post Office had been made. All cases in which grants were being made were at once reviewed, and a revised record re-written oh Application Forms. Upon the Case Paper was written (1) the applicants statement, (2) the report of the home visit, (3) the result of veri-fication of wages, rent, etc.,. (4) any further information necessary to make clear to the Committee the actual position of the person applying. The decision of the Committee was then written on the Case Paper in red ink with date, the duration of the grant, and the regulation under which it was made. This method has been useful to the Committee, and is now proving of value in the case of those persons who are applying for supplementary pensions or continuing allowances.Visiting.The first home visit is always made by an experienced worker. A careful, leisurely home visit is the soundest method of obtaining a solid and reliable basis for the case. The right sort of visitor gets an accurate im-pression of the home, and the family, and even if it is not found possible to grant what is applied for, a favour-able impression is created and the person is led to look upon the office of the Local Committee as a refuge in time of trouble. It frequently occurs that although the particular grant asked for cannot be made, yet the home visit discovers needs that may be met under some other regulation. The person visited is urged to call at the office if she should find herself in any kind of difficulty. Once the allowance is fixed, the case is handed over to an Almoner, whose function is to convey to the house what has been granted by the Committee, and, having read the report, to note any change in circumstances and to notify them to the office when of sufficient importance.^Accounts.In one particular we felt^sgome difficulty. How should we keep our accounts ? We &quot;c^fe^ed to go slowly for the time being. We filed all the &quot; E^l^orms, thinking it best to gain experienceof the working of theS. Regulations before we committed ourselves to a definite^ method of account keeping.   Our serious concern Vjf&apos;as to securetwo things:   (1) the signature of every recipient every payment made, and (2) a careful record of exact regulation under which every applicant assisted.   A Pay Card was devised for each beneflci; ruled to last a quarter, containing date, amount regulation, and a space for the signature of the reeipie From the Regulations, Part II., paragraph 64, assis by these Cards, we eventually devised an &quot; R 9,&quot; fr which we had prepared our first &quot; R 7,&quot; before official document of the same character had appear This method has worked simply, and we find no trou in preparing the quarterly return &quot; R 7.&quot;   Besi being useful for book-keeping and quarterly retur it at the same time constitutes an individual ledger, a when filed, is easily accessible so that it is a siin matter to discover the actual amount granted to and every individual since the adoption of the Act.I am afraid I have not made the position of this P Card quite clear, but the space at my disposal prove my saying more here. If anyone who reads this desk to hear more, I sincerely hope he or she will write to direct.Co-operation.The Leicester Committee works ha full co-operat with all.the Agencies of the town, both official voluntary, so that a telephone call is all that is necess to secure an early visit from a Doctor, District Nur Health or Maternity Visitor or almost any other form assistance according to need, which by isolated lnana ment could never have been seemed.Disabled Men.When familiarity with the many Army and Statut Committee Forms and Circulars had been acquired, there appeared a possibility of a period of smooth comparatively easy working we, in common with other Committees, were met by the difficulties attend upon the appearance of the disabled man in lai numbers.   To deal with the disabled man was, hi opinion, a man&apos;s job, and to continue the employmc of the lady visitors to investigate these cases, appeaL1 to be out of the question.   Innumerable notificati of discharged disabled men came in weekly, but v few of the men followed official or unofficial instructi When sent for they failed to respond, and we reali that stronger measures were essential.   The element school teachers were approached and forty men teach after being advised and instructed, were good enou to undertake to visit the disabled men in their honu Some members of the Committee also undertook work, and whenever necessary the disabled men attend the meetings of the Disablement Sub-Committee.Medical Board.The need of medical direction -was at once appar The doctors of the town were approached with splen results.   A voluntary Medical Board was offered, needless to say, was gratefully accepted.   The Boai
tit ftf t!ciar.h is mainly composed of medical men attached to Base Military Hospital here, meet at night at lock, in order that the disabled men who are engaged jig the day may not lose time from work.   They ee other men specially, as required, and so far as ible, at the man&apos;s convenience, is branch of the Committee&apos;s work is now well in .  The town is divided into some seventy or eighty jions, for which there is a man visitor who is responsi-for a minimum- of ten disabled men.   This is too toy, and it is hoped to obtain the assistance of other able visitors.ithout dealing with either training or treatment, ay say that we have 750 men registered.e history, civil and military, local and industrial each of these men is carefully recorded, and the cester Committee are determined, not merely to list them so far as official regulations permit, but also &apos; bang on &quot; to them until they and their families are a position of economic independence. This is the mittee&apos;s ideal.Local Fund.this is very warmly encouraged by the Mayor of the [tough, and to show how heartily- this gentleman is lernsted in the ultimate welfare of the disabled, I have m to state that he has promoted a scheme by which lintcnds to raise a Fund of  100,000 (of which  40,000 already been obtained) to assist where the State lemes fall short, in order that Leicester men shall Irt civil life again in the same social status in which ly left it to take up arms for their Country.Strangers.sliould like to- say one brief word concerning the ablcd men who are going from town to town. The licester Committee have declined emphatically to list such men, and no man belonging to any other 1m is considered eligible for assistance unless his j?spnce in Leicester is pre-arranged by the respective Immitcees.iLaxity of administration where these men are con-ped means ruin to them. By it they aie encouraged I wander and their deterioration is aided and abetted.Conclusion.I have endeavoxrred to describe the work attempted &apos; one Local Committee, there are three hundred others io can offer similar records. The Statutory Committee A the Local Committees have been subjected to very fere criticism, not always justified, but I venture to y that when the country learns the work that has tually been done, it will discover that among the many deficient enterprises which the country has provoked, if will: show more justification of their existence than Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory immittee and their five or six thousand Local and ib-Coinmittees.W. E. HINCKS.The Training of the Disabled.No. 1.-The Cordwainers&apos; Technical College, Bethnal Green Road.The Cordwainers Technical College (Incorporated) have attempted to solve one small part of this problem. A scheme was brought before the Board of Management in January, 1915, to train disabled soldiers and sailors in the trade of hand-sewn bootmaking. , With the help of the Advisory Trade Committee (the members of which are actually engaged in the trade) a scheme was pre-pared, particular attention being paid to the question of the Ukelihood of the work being suitable to the dis-abilities of the men and to their being likely to obtain remunerative employment after their training.In this class of work there is always a demand for efficient craftsmen among West End firms, and prior to the war many foreigners were so employed. A man capable of making a boot throughout should certainly be able to repair the same, and if he wished could set up in his own town or village on his own account. The trade is a sedentary one, can be done at home, as out work, or in a workshop, and as long as a man has two hands he can do the work with the aid of certain appli-ances, even though he may have lost both his legs.Further, the men will not be drafted into an over-crowded trade nor displace other British labour. Arrangements have been made for them to be taken into the Trade Union, and the Board has found the attitude of these bodies very sympathetic, as they have been able to assure themselves that the training at Bethnal Green will turn out efficient workmen.The scheme provided that the teaching should be both theoretical and practical, and that the daily horns of attendance should be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m, The course of instruction covers the making of men and women&apos;s hand-sewn boots with methods of repairing, the making of men&apos;s and women&apos;s machine-welted boots, the making and repairing of sew-rounds work and special supplementary instruction as follows : How to take a measure of a customers foot and fit boots for the same.How to send a measure to the upper maker or manu-facturer.The selection and purchase of bottom stock. How to cost the finished work. The anatomy of the foot.It was not thought desirable to include in the scheme any training for factory indoor work, although it might be. possible with certain, forms of.disablement to do this at a later period.The scheme provided a course of at least 46 weeks, and the Advisory Trade Committee were strongly of opinion that this must be adhered to, as being the least possible time it would take to instruct a man, even on an intensive system, so as to turn him out an efficient workman. Men were at first very shy of undertaking such a long course, but now that they can see the result
6THE WAR PENSIONS ^GAZETTE.May. 1917.more are coming forward. Owing to the time neces-sarily taken in making the various arrangements and obtaining the necessary men, the first class was not started till February, 1916, and the second class in December of the same year. Altogether 38 men have joined the classes. Five out of the seven men who have left have obtained seats of work in the West End at good wages varying from 9s. to 12s. for making up a pair of shoes. When these men become more used to then.&quot; work they should be able to turn out 4 pairs of boots or shoes a week. Of the other two, one has since died, and the other, a double amputation case, has had to return to hospital. To meet a demand it was decided to start boot repairing classes so as to enable certain men who felt they were not able to take a full 12 months course to fit themselves to earn a livelihood. These classes, which are for a period of 6 months, have now been started, and the work done is eminently satisfactory.Fancy Leather Goods.At the instance of the Fancy Leather Goods Manufac-turers the College has taken over classes held at Queen Mary&apos;s Hospital, Roehampton, in this trade, which formerly was almost entirely in the hands of foreigners. Preliminary Avork is done there every morning, and a syllabus is now being prepared for the classes which it is proposed to start at once at the College. The period of training in this branch is also for 6 months. In connection with this course the Fancy Leather Goods Manufacturers&apos; Association have opened a register for applications from firms who are willing to take into their employ men who have completed their 6 months training, so that the number taken into training can be made to equal the situations vacant, and at present there are many more men required than there are applicants for instruction. A certain amount of difficulty is here found in that the men seem to think that this is women&apos;s work, not men&apos;s. This is, however, a mistake, certain work in this trade is always done by men, and it is the better paid and better class work.In all sections during the first portion of the training as wide a view as possible is given of the work. Later, the pupil is encouraged to specialise in the branch that he prefers or is especially good at.It must not be forgotten that a mid-day meal is provided for the men at the College and a charge of 6d. is made for a two course dinner, and with the exception of the gas and wages of the cook these dinners are self-supporting. When the men first come to the College they are still feeling the shock of their wound, and this and the men&apos;s temperament together require very special treatment, and these dinners are a great help to the Principal in dealing with the men. Further, -a Captain is elected in each class by the men from amongst themselves who receives any complaints and keeps order, and this has worked admirably. There is a wonderful difference in the men after they have been at the College for some little time.   A fund has alsobeen provided, by means of concerts, for providing too for the men on leaving.The many satisfactory notices that have from f to time appeared in the Press, and also the criticis and remarks of membeis of the trades who have inspect the work, have satisfied the Governors from outsi sources that the work they have undertaken is a succes and one that should be pursued as far as the nature the trade will permit.C. H. W. MANDER.Pensions in Parliament.-o-Pensions.Mr. J. 0&apos;Gfady asked the Parliamentary Secretary t the Local Government Board whether the Brarnle (Leeds) Board of Guardians have deducted 8s. a wee from the pension of E. E. Dickinson, late of the Wch Yorkshire Regiment, who is.at present an inmate of th Menston Asylum, as a result of wounds and gas attack inflicted while serving in the Army; whether thi deduction leaves Mrs. Dickinson 18s. a week to maintai herself and four children ; and, having regard to tb hardship thus arising, whether steps will be taken t prevent any deduction from the mairs pension ?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Govern ment Board (Mr. Hayes Fisher): I understand that th object which the guardians had in view was to preven cases of this kind becoming chargeable to the Pou Law. Such cases will in future be dealt with by tb grant of an allowance under Article 6 of the propose new Royal Warrant, and the wife would, during tin period of her husband&apos;s detention in an asylum, receiv an amount not less than the pension and allowanc for children to which she would have been entitle had she been a widow.Sickness.Mr. Wing asked the Pensions Minister if he is aware that the omission of the word &quot; widow &quot; preceding th word &quot; wife &quot; in the first line of Regulation 13 (a), paragraph 49, is causing local War Pensions Committee much anxiety, as they are unable to grant emergenc; help as heretofore, while such assistance is still granted and lightly so, to wife, child, or dependant of a sailu or soldier ; and what steps are intended to remedy tin omission and place such committees in a position tc give help to widows of sailors and soldiers in cases o special medical need as outlined in the abov Regulations ?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry o Pensions (Sir A. S. T. Griffith-Boscawen): My hon. Frieir is under some misapprehension, as no power of assisfcin widows exercised heretofore by the local committee has been withdrawn. Regulation 13 (a) was extende in December last to cases of childless widows whos-income does not exceed. 15s. a week, and a furthe extension is now,under consideration.   This, if approved
HiI believe, meet the cases for which the hon. Member s assistance.. Scobt asked, with regard to the recently announced ,t cf supplementary allowances for wives who are jcilly unfit for work, under Statutory Committee Jations, Part II, No. 7(1) (d), (amended), whether fe who is unfit for work owing to her approaching finement is eligible for such supplementary irance ? -r A. S. T. Griffith-Boscawen : The reply is in theinnlive.boots.disablement.?. Wing asked the Minister of Labour what is the cut number of disabled men whose names are on lists of the Employment Exchanges throughout the Eey,;.&apos;(! Kingdom as applying for employment, and &quot;for he r many men so enrolled work has been found since q January ?lie Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour :, W. C. Bridgeman): The number of discharged iiers and sailors on the registers of the Employment hanges on 9th February, 1917, was 2,886, and the iber for whom employment has been found through Exchanges during the period from 8th December !th February was 5,160. The total number for whom ployment has been found through the Exchanges Bi April last untiT 9th February is aboxit 50,000. arate figures cannot be given for disabled men as h, but it may be assumed that the great majority he men above referred to were suffering from some m of disablement.1 tocirculars.(Complaints have been made of the number of Circulars lady issued by the Statutory Committee. It may be linted out that practically every circular issued has Incased the powers of the Local Committees, thereby ping effect to many of the useful representations made [them.[Some Local Committees are inclined, very naturally, I attempt to meet hard cases by stretching a regulationmost to breaking point. The proper course is to ingest amendments of the Regulations, which willable such cases to be dealt with without risk of liverse report by the Inspectors, and possible disallow-flo by the Auditors.Wherever it has been shown that there is a good reason jr amendment, the Statutory Committee have always lieavoured to obtain powers to make the necessaryange. In suggesting remedies, however, the limita-[ins imposed upon the Statutory Committee under the fval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c, Act, must be niembered, and the fact that funds are provided byState should be borne in mind.The Lord Kitchener Memorial Fund, owing to the generosity of certain of the big manufacturers, have been able to place at our disposal a Umited number of pahs of children&apos;s boots and shoes.As a general rule, it was agreed that such things as boots, clothing, etc., ought to be provided by local effort, but in some districts it is impossible to respond to applications of this kind, and where boots cannot be obtained from any othSr source, we shall gladly provide them as long as our very Kmited supplies hold out. -o--disablement register. o Several Local Committees have protested against Circular 30 the Register for Disabled men and being called upon to furnish monthly returns.The monthly returns are asked for by the Pensions Minister to enable him to answer questions in Parliament with respect to the treatment and training of disabled men, and the number of cases dealt with, and it should not be forgotten that such information affords the only means of bringing to the public notice any idea of the. extent of the work now being carried on by Local Committees.As regards the Register, the particulars are, no doubt, numerous, but the form was not-adopted until it had been submitted to several Local Committees, and the Statutory Committee hope that by means of the par-ticulars referred to, Local Committees will find the work connected with classification materially facilitated.voluntary funds. o As is known the Statutory Committee have been entrusted with the administration of certain- voluntary funds, but these have mostly been subscribed for certain definite objects, such as the relief of the sailors and their families who suffered as the result of the Jutland battle. Some funds are ear-marked for the relatives of sailors in particular ships the &quot; Queen Mary &quot; and others.These limitations prevent the voluntary funds being available for many very hard cases, and it is most desirable that Local Committees should have at their disposal voluntary funds which can be devoted by them to cases which are outside the scope of the funds which are already in existence.-o-administrative expenses.Under the Naval and - Military War Pensions, &amp;c. (Administrative Expenses) Bill which has passed the House of Commons and is, as we go to press, before the House of Lords, provision is made for a contribution from national funds towards the administrative ex-penses of Local Committees. Subject to the approval, by the Local Government Board, or, in Scotland, by the Secretary for Scotland, of the estimated expenditure, the State will pay two-thirds of the actual expenses incurred, not exceeding two-thirds of the approved estimate.
8THE WAR PENSIONS GAZETTE.May, 1917Questions and Answers.-0-Q. 1. Cases have been brought to our notice where a soldier has been hilled and subsequently his father dies leaving his mother unprovided for. The son who has been killed either did not support his mother before enlistment or only.to a small extent, and there is no pension or one of a few shillings only. As the father died after the son toill the Statutory Committee grant a Special (Temporary) Allowance to the mother or supplement her small pension ?A. The Statutory Committee will consider cases of this kind specially, and if it can be shown that the son, had he lived, would have been both able and willing to support his mother or to increase the support given before enlistment, they will favourably consider the question of granting a Special (Temporary) Allowance or a Supplementary Pension under Regulation - 32 or Regulation 29.-o-Q. 2. Aboy joined the Navy in 1910. His father recently died, and his mother is now in difficulties. The son is an A.B. and has allotted 5s. a week. Is the case one for assist-ance under Regulation 9 (a) ?A. The answer is in the negative. Grants under Regulation 9 (a) in the case of a long service man assume that the man would in peace time have been willing and able to obtain his discharge on compassionate grounds and return to civil life to support his parent. In the case quoted the man has had considerable service and it is improbable that he would have been discharged. Moreover, he can from his pay help his mother to a much greater extent than 5s a week, and the fact that he has not done all that is possible is an indication of the extent to which he is whling to shoulder his respon-sibility.-0-Q. 3. The illegitimate child&apos; of a soldier married with wife and one legitimate child. He allots 3s. Qd. and the wife and child receive separation allowance of 19s. 6d. Before enlistment he regularly contributed 2s. 6d. for the support of the illegitimate child. (1) 7s it necessary for him to make an additional allotment in respect of the illegitimate child to secure to it the amount of prc-ivar dependence (namely, 2s. Gd.) ? (2) May we, under new Regulation 7 (1) (d) grant a supplementary allowance of33 J per cent, of the admitted dependence on account of i increased cost of living 1 D.M.H.A. (1) If the father is aprivate soldier receiving t ordinary rate of pay he cannot be expected to rnaj an allotment towards the support of the megitinj child and an allowance of 2s. 6d. a week may be gil under Regulation 8 (b). (2) No, Regulation 7 (1)1 does not authorise further allowances in respect of spec] or supplementary separation allowances.-o-Q. 4. If a soldier has no other dependants than j illegitimate child, does the child rank for State separate allowance as an ordinary dependant ? For instance! before enlistment, he was regularly contributing i towards its maintenance, is an allotment of 7d. a ui sufficient to entitle the child to the 2/6 of pre-w dependence 1 W.M.H.A. Paragraph 75 of the Army Separation Allow;]n Regulations deals with this class of case. In t] circumstances mentioned, the child is eligible I separation allowance. If the soldier, before enlistmed gave 2/6 a week voluntarily the conditions govemii dependants&apos; allowances apply, and a State allowance ( 1/11 a week is issuablo if the man allots 7d. a week. 1 however, the pre-enlistment payment was made undj an Order of Court, the soldier is required to allot 2 a week and the separation allowance would be 2d. week only.&quot; W.P.G.&quot; Distribution. o It is hoped that Local Committees will do the best to make the existence of &quot; The War Pensloi Gazette &quot; known within the area for which they ai responsible.It will be obtainable through any bookseller from tl Stationery Office, and it is hoped that it may be se supporting.Six copies will, In future, be issued, free of charge, I each Local Committee.LONDON:PUBLISHED BY HIS MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICE.To be purchased through any Bookseller or directly from H.M.
