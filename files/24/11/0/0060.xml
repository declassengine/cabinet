Following for Mr. Balfour :-

The War Cabinet considered this morning the shipping situation, which is now most serious. Fifty-five British ships were sunk by mine or submarine last week and the average rate of loss is not diminishing. The only possible safeguard against a continuance of these heavy lesses is the provision of a great many more patrol craft. We are proposing to start a system of convey through dangerous waters but this system cannot possibly be put into force without more destroyers. Will you impress with great force upon the United States authorities the very urgent need for more destroyers being sent to assist us. If the total could be made up even to twenty-four based on Ireland, it would help to reduce the losses to a reasonable amount, but we want as many as we can get. The matter does not break of a moment&apos;s delay. The provision of patrol craft of other kinds is also an absolute necessity and should be sent if they are available.
