Timber   Sup-plies. Report by the Secretary of State for WarIIn accordance with the request contained in W.C.118(7)-, I submit for the information of the War Cabinet the following memorandum.   .i iActing on the orders of the War Cabinet, I appointed Sir Bampfylde Fuller,  (hereinafter called the D.T.S.), to be Director of Timber Supplies, and directed him to -prepare a scheme of organisation for the supply and transport of all kinds of timber including pit-props.iHe renorts to me that he has grouped the counties of England and Wales into Forest Divisions, to each of which one or two officers will be posted, charged (a) with Forestry, that is to say, with the selection of Forests, their valuation, negotiation with their owners, and the drawing up of simple working plans, and (b) with Works and Transport.     A similar scheme will be elaborated   1 for Scotland, and in Ireland it is proposed to create an organisation! on perhaps a less formal basis.He is of opinion that we should aim at providing departmentally, during the next 12 months, 1,500,000 tons of pitwood and 2,000,000 tons of sawn timber.     The imports of pitwood during 1916 amount to 2,000,000 tons.     But over and above these imports, 1,000,000 tons of home-grown pitwood were contributed by private effort, and with the stimulation of high prices, the business is extending.     We may assume that during the coming year 1,500,000 tons of pitwood will be cut independently of State agency.     The imports of sawn timber during 1916 amounted to 4,200,000 tons.     But very considerable quantities of home-grown sawn timber are now being placed upon the market, by private effort, and, if individual enterprise is encouraged, it should assist us very greatly.     By the effecting of economies, consumption can be reduced much more extensively than was anticipated by the Inter-Denartmental Committee on the Restriction of Imports.     And we can draw upon our stocks, which are considerable, though dwindling with ominous rapidity.     The provision of a larger departmental output of sawn timber than   2,000,000 tons has been considered, but, taking the most hopeful view of our labour resources, we cannot expect to extract and convert more than this.It is clear that we can rely upon private enterprise to supplement our operations very materially indeed, and that its effective encouragement must be a cardinal feature of our policy. We must be exceedingly cautious in interfering with the prices of home-grown timber and so lessening the force of self-interest. The Department, is establishing relations with Saw Mill Associations and.private Saw Mills throughout the country.Requirements.In producing 1,500,000 tons of pitwood and 2,000,000 tons of sawn timber, we shall exhaust 240 square miles of forest.     We shall require a labour force at least 50,000 strong.     A large proportion of the men must have had experience of timber work or must be trained before they will be effective.     Towards this we have at present a labour force of but little over 2,000 men of whom half are German prisoners.       In addition, there areCanadian
Canadian lumbermen companies nearly 4,000 strong, but we have agreed to send them across to France in view of the pressing necessities of the Army in France.The Russian Government could hold out no hones of procuring Finnish labour.     The D.T.S. has, nevertheless, sent a recruiting agent to Finland, as   it is understood that there is labour to spare there.The Canadian Government has agreed to increase from 5,000 to 7,000, the strength of lumber companies that are now being recruited and equipped on a military basis.The Government of Newfoundland has undertaken to raise a force of lumbermen (on Canadian lines) which it is hoped will amount to 2,000 men.The D.T.S. has been in communication (unofficial and official) with the Ministry of National Service., but he has as yet received no definite indication of the numbers with which this Ministry could assist us.     He does not think that it would be prudent to rely upon more than 5,000.     To fell and saw timber men must be capable of hard and continuous labour, and, barred as we are from competing with agriculture, it does not. seem probable that volunteers of this class will come forward in large numbers.The Home Grown Timber Committee have in the past obtained a few labourers from Portugal, recruited through the Labour Exchange.     The D.T.S. is continuing this recruitment. With the assent of the Spanish Government we are recruiting in Northern Spain, and it is in contemplation to recruit in Southern Italy, where he is informed some wood-cutters are available. Ireland should offer a more promising field, and recruitment is in progress there.     If all goes well we may perhaps expect to recruit as many as 8,000 men in these various countries.Our hypothetical expectations may be summarised asfollows :-.Military companies of lumbermenfrom Canada and Newfoundland From the Ministry ofNational Service     (say) Recruited in Ireland and in variousforeign countries   (say)Add&apos;the labour force now in employ (the Canadians apart)TOTALIf we raise to 8,000 our expected contingent from the Ministry of National Service, we shall still need an- additional force of 25,000.... Transnort.So far as railway transport is concerned, no very great difficulty need be anticipated.     The home grown timber which will he thrown upon the railways will simply replace foreign timber which they have in the past carried from the ports.7 ,0005,0008,000 20,0002,000 22,000Road
Road transport offers a far more difficult problem. Timber must frequently be carried 15 miles and more to the nearest railway station.     But there is a fair expectation of finding a solution of this difficulty in the utilisation of military Iran sport.We shall require at least 1,400 Saw Mills, and a very large number of axes and cross-saws.With referenco to the above report it will be seen that the chief difficulty is the provision of labour, and I confess to be unable to see a satisfactory solution of the subject.    I had hoped that we might have been able to obtain a certain number of men now lent to agriculture, but after consultation with G.H.Q,., Home Forces, I fear this is impossible.       When the men lent from France and from draft providing units are returned to the Colours the number left will barely suffice the needs of agriculture and cannot be withdrawn.The labour force which the D.T.S. may expect to raise cannot then be expected to exceed 22,000.     This force (so soon as it is got together) would suffice to extract all the pitwood which we require, provided that private enterprise is not hampered in its endeavours.     But it would produce only one-third of the minimum quantity of sawn timber which is needed (2,000,000 tons).       I fear,  then, that the importation of timber must be allowed to continue if we are to provide for the urgent requirements of the Army, the Admiralty and the Ministry of Mun i t i on s,With regard to France, matters are in a more satisfactory condition.     Brigadier-General Lord Lovat has been appointed to the Staff of G.H.Q..  to superintend Forestry in that country, and I am glad to say that reports I have received from him show that he is getting the work \vell in hand   and that to a very large extent France in the future will be able to supply the wants of our Army in that country.     It may be necessary to send a certain amount of seasoned wood, but it will only amount to a very small proportion of the amount hitherto sent from this country.There is one question, however, which requires decision by the War Cabinet, both as to labour in France and in England. Both the D.I.S. and Lord Lovat strongly urge that there shall be bonuses given as a payment for results.     They say without that it is impossible to-get full value out of the Canadians, and Lord Lovat even proposes to give it to the German prisoners.     He gives me some striking figures of the difference in work done in this country on his own estate by prisoners when Y/orking under ordinary conditions and when working under a bonus system,     I consulted Sir Douglas Haig on this subject and he sees no objection, but it. is a departure from the general principle that soldiers should receive other than soldiers&apos; pay, and I do not feel quite sure how far th-it&quot; principle will be undermined in other ranks of the Army by the adoption of the bonus system. At the same time I am quite convinced that its adoption will give us at lea.st 50 per cent more production.DERBY.22nd April, 1917
