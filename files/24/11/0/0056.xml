SECRET&apos; ^ X&quot; ifG^T^J^So^w&quot;AR CABINET. 227RSPQRT. OF-zMTiOfTAL S^ICE.;\f0 were instructed &quot;by a Minute of the Cabinet of March 30th. to examine what progress had been made in&apos; the scheme cf national Service and what changes,  if any,  of method or organisation were, required.We began our enquiries on tho assumption that the relations between the Director and the Ministry cf labour would continue to be governed by the agreement which had already been accepted by both parties and approved by the Cabinet.-   The agreement was based on the principle that it - was the business; cf St.- ErminVs to find the men and of Montagu House to place them, and we see no reason-to suppose, - that this division of function -was not admire istratively sound.    We. found, however,  that the arrangement had -broken down and that the Joint Executive Committee which had been set .up to deal with all matters of common concern to the two Departments had, after two meetings,  suspended its operations A We were compelled therefore in the first instance,  and before pro-ceeding with our enquiry,  to endeavour to negotiate a fresh settle-; ment between &quot;the two Departments on whose co-operation the &quot;success of any scheme of national--Service must largely depend.The point on which the Departments wore at issue was the use that was to bo made of the Labour Exchanges in the allocation of volunteers.    The Ministry of Labour pointed cut that the alloca-tion of Labour was essentially their function,  that their staff was specially-trained to carry out the many and. intricate. pro- . ccssen which the shifting of men from one occupation to another involves,  and that if tho allocation of volunteers were., to be en-trusted to. another Department,   one of two results must, follow:-cither the work would not be properly done or a completely new . machinery,  duplicating at every point the existing -organisation, would have to be set-up.    The- National Service Department on the other hand contended that the new scheme (-which also had been approved by the Cabinet) -for forming Committees.of employers and employed in the principal industries and localities to create a reserve of substitution volunteers,  could only bo successfully worked with the co-operation of organised labour and they were doubtful whether-this support would be forthcoming if the allo-cation of &apos; the volunteers thus obtained were loft to the Employ-ment Exchanges.. &apos;-.--:&apos;--This was the position which we found at the beginning of our enquiry and after a preliminary general discussion with the heads of the two Departments on March. 31st..&apos; wc decided to see the National Service Labour Advisory Committee whose representations, we gathered, had disposed the Director tc the view that the origin-al scheme was not workable.The Advisory Committee, whom we met on April 2nd. includes some-of the best known and ablest leaders of organised labour, men,  that is to say, who undoubtodly had it in their &quot;power by giving or withholding their support to make the new scheme a success or failure,  and the discussion left no doubt whatsoever in our minds that if the Employment Exchanges vere kept in the position which they held in the original settlement,  no.,futher assistance could be expected from- the Committee.   As we.$ffready satisfied that - the new plan afforded on the whole the best pros-pects for the successful development of the national resources in man-power, we feit.lt our duty&apos; without enquiring into the pre-cise juotif id at! on fo-r their hostility to- the Exchanges,  to see what could-be&apos; done tc meet their views...  At the same time we had
to reckon with the fact that the principal ohject of National Service is to provide suh statutes for men taken- for the army, that the Ministry cf Munitions.are more concerned than any other Department in the question of substitution and that the Employ-ment Exchanges are an integral part of the machinery of the Minds-try, both for maintaining and directing the supply of-labour.In the end,  after negotiations,  in which,  as we are glad to recognise,  the officials of the three Departments concerned gave -all the assistance in their power,  a fresh settlement was arranged and after full discussion at two meetings an   April 10th,  and April 11th. was finally accepted as our decision.It is based on the principle that while full use should be , made cf the machinery of the Exchanges for collecting, authenticat&apos; ing and circulating demands for labour,   the interviewing and allo-cation of volunteers (as distinguished from the ordinary supplies of unemployed labour)  should be performed by the-Director .and his representatives. (Details of the new scheme are given-.in the Appendix).Having disposed of this question we proceeded to examine the organisation of the Department.   Under the new scheme the work will be decentralised as far as possible and there will there-fore be no longer the same necessity for maintaining a large staff at headquarters.    The substitution officers,  70 in number will be grouped in eight areas, each under the control of a Oommissio ner who is a Superintending Factory Inspector lent by the Home Office. The Commissioners1 principal duties will be to supervise the substitution officers and to assist in the organisation of the local Committees.    In this last respect,  their previous experience ought to be of great service as several of them have already,   on behalf of the Home Office,  carried through scheme of dilution on /cry similar lines.   The Commissioners will bo uador the general control of 3&amp;r. R. S. Graves,. Deputy Chief In-Gpy-e&apos; \o&apos;J of factories who will be attached to the headquarters&apos;  stair at St,Ermin:s. The War Office have made arrangements by which accommodation and clerical staff will be found for the substitution officers in the offices of the area recruiting officers,  and,  as a dilution officer of the Ministry,  a representative of the Employment Exchange,  and,  where necessary,  a representative of the Admiralty will be housed in the same building,  it should not be difficult to secure constant and intimate co-operation between all the Departments concerned,    So far as the allocation of the volunteers is concerned,  these arrangements (which will come into operation onlay 1st.) appear to us to be satisfactory.Arrangements for sec Ting volunteers have necessarily been modified by the adopt!-. of the - new scheme of Trado Committees. The number of genera&quot;1   /olunteers by the time this report is in the hands of the Cablet will not be much less than 300.000 but allocation has under the original system proceeded very slowly Partly because so large a proportion of men enrolled are already engaged on work of national importance,  and partly because so much uncertainty,(leading in turn to protests, appeals and delays) has existed as to the kind of employment for which the volunteers wero wanted.    It is not proposed to close the general enrolment altogether but in future the general volunteers will be treated as a reserve in hand and the bulk of the labour required for substitution will be mobilised by direct agreement with the less important trades.    The principle is that of a voluntary ration-,^3 of labour within each trade and area but any surplus thus iisclosed will be available for transfer outside the area to tradeg of primary importance which have exhausted their local supplies.
(9)        1% appears t* us that the sudcess of the new scheme   . will depend mainl^- on, the support of organised labour and the rapid.and effective organisation of the Trade Committees, As regards, the first We have; received the strongest assurances from the labour Advisory Committee.that they&apos;will do all in their power to make.the scheme a, success and. that they realise the responsibility they had taken in asking the Government te-v-; reverse in deference to their objections a policy already.   ., l^ald down.     Two members of &quot;the Committee will be attached to &apos; the staff of&apos; St .ErminT s to asaiat in the organisation of the scheme from the labour aide and it is&quot;proposed to associate with them two representatives of Employer&apos;&apos;a Organisations.     At the same ; t ime the -&amp;j-servei Occupations Committee (of which -, Mr .Gravcs is &apos; a-member),.-will continue&apos;the&quot; enquiries ,&apos; statistical and direct, ywhich; they &apos; have been engaged on for some time -with a view ;to ascertaining the most likely sources of available labour and.the proportion that can be released from each trade. Uhese investigations.are to be the br..sis of a series of uoffOtiatIons vd th the Indus trios ( some o f whic h have air ea&amp;y been begun) and. the results will be&apos; communicated for the guidanoe of local.Committees and substitution officers inarranging for the release of local quotas.if 101-      It ia- clear that a.scheme like this will involve a great measure of loc..vl enterprise and. we are of opinion that: much of the energy which has been devoted to the general,. campaign oould usefully be diverted to the neworganis.ati.cn.-The Campaign Committee, ever which Ivlr. Henderson presided has held nr arranged upwards of .2,000 public meetings aha has secured the assistance of the principal political org&amp;n-ieationB and their agents throughout the country,     They have- offered to place their services at tho Director1s disposal for the purposes of the new scheme, and we are of opinion that where special appeals are desirable they can be of great assist^-ance in organising local campaigns.   - Otherwise as soon as the present programme- is exhiii sted, meetings can be       discontinued; promiscuous advertising which involved&apos;&apos;&amp;h expenditure of money out of all proportion to tho results, attained has already been stopped.(11).     We have only.one thing to add:   it is clear that the greatest possible mischief has been . done by the controversy which has been going on in the. Press, especially as to the merits&apos;and demerits of the Employment.-ExchangesWe believe ^hat..both Departments how realise, that, bad as it is to hat e departmental projects canvassed in the Press, it is even worse&apos; to/make interdepartmental differences, the subject for. public.recrimination and we hope that for the future the heads of the.-two-Departments will&apos; impress upon their subordinates-and their assistants&apos;the -desirability.of reticence and courtesy in the, handling of departmental differences.(12)      Wo propose to watch the development of.tho new organl-sation carefully and to give all the assistance&quot;in our power in removing difficulties which may impede its successful operation. ...

The Minister of Labour undertakes to place the Iftployrneirt Exchanges ab the disposal of the Direct or of national hervice for the purposes of the national Service scheme.,      Tho allocation of national Service Volunteers by way of oubstitu-tion or otherwise will in future ce performed by the Department of - the- Director-General of National Service who -ill receive the assistance of tne Empioymenc Department of the Mini sir y of Labour in the manner indicated below.. Instructions to Officers cf the Employment Departmehi regarding National Service will be issued through Mr. Rey. the Director of  the Employment Department.-a, Vacancies in munition works (including Admiralty work ) to he filled by substitutes, will continue t&apos;o bo notified by the Dilution Officers to tho Employment Exchanges;   &quot;other vacancies in such work will be notified direct to&apos;the Employment Jicchangeo as hithertoib. The register of Volunteers will be kept by the Substitu-&apos; tion Officer, who will receive all enrolment forms, whether from Local Trade Committees or from tho Employment Deportment at hew and.  in consultation with tho Local Trade Committee concerned will call up and interview Volunteers.o, If a demand is not met locally,  the present procedure isfor the origination Exchange to telephone it to the District Clearing Exchange which,  in turn,  communicates with the other-Exchanges in the Clearing Area, and.  if unsuccessful. with the Central Clearing House, which circulates all unfilled vacancies to all Exchanges in the country on the. day cf receipt.If vacancies are not filled in this way.  or if it is at any stage clear that they are of such a nature or Ox  sucn magnitude that they are not likely to be so filled, the o r i g ina t i ng Ex c hange will inform the Loo a1 Substitution Officer who.  in consultation with the Local Trade Committee concerned, will submit particulars of suitable volunteers on his register to the employer^L If the employer accepts the Volunteer., the -SubstitutionOfficer will then&apos; post him and send him his railway warrant. and inform the originating Exchangeee. If the Substitution Officer with the assistance of theTrade Committee is unable to fill a vacancy from his local register, he- will so inform the Empioymenc Exchange which &quot;Mil notify the Central Clearing House, which will circulate the vacancy to all Substitution Officers. -
