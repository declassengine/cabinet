f Any further communication should be addressed not to any individual by name, but to-The Director, Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department, 72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1. and should quote the Reference Number and Date of this letter.Registered Telegraphic A ddress: &quot;Growmore, Sowest, London.&quot; Telephone: Victoria 8240.oAB,Webaix siCO,hgriculture and fisheries,Production Department,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1. 18th April, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to submit the following Report for the week ended 17th April:-Returns have now been received from District Commis-sioners showing the estimated Increased area which will be brought under cultivation this year throughout England and Wales.The total estimated increase over 1916 is 333.284 acres which, in view of the exceedingly unfavourable season, must be considered as very satisfactory.     In previous reports I have refrained  rom including any estimate of a probable Increase, because I feared that any forecast might, in view of the unprecedented weather conditions * prove to have been misleading. The returns now received, however, appear to justify the hope that, in spite of the great shortage of labour, the weather and other exceptional difficulties, the area under the plrugh this year will be well above the 1916 level, which was Itself the highest since 1913.     This is evidence that the work of the Department and the Executive Committees is already bearing fruit, and that agriculturists generally are responding to the urgent needs of the times.I.     LOCAL ORGANISATION.Wcrk of Agricultural Executive Committees. While the Committees continue to arrange for cultiva-tion for the 1917 crop, and while taking measures to ensure that the directions already given for such cultivation, are carried out, several of them are taking preliminary steps for the cleaning
and summer fallowing of lands with a view to the harvest of 1918, and some Tufre submitted proposals for taking possession of lands for this purpose, which are too foul to allow any hope of a crop In 1917.The following are specific instances of action taken during the week in various counties:-Bedfordshire - The Executive Committee have taken possession of 75 acres of land at Meppershall, in order to cultivate by steam tackle for the 1918 crop.Dorset - The Executive Committee have given directions for the cultivation, with a late variety of oats, of 140 acres of land at Tarrant Rushton this month.Huntingdonshire - The Executive Committee have been authorised to take possession of 225 acres of glebe land at Offord dfArcy, and of 122 acres of glebe land at Wyton.Kent - The Committee are enforcing cultivation by steam tackle in many parts of the county.Lincftlaahlre - The Lindsey and KeSteven Executive Committees are refusing permits for the cultivation of mustard where the land is in a condition to grow corn, oats or roots, except in special circumstances.Suffolk, East - Warning notices have been issued to farmers, who have received specific directions for cultivation, that their operations will be systematically reviewed in May and June. Suffolk, West - The Executive Committee are taking possession of two farms at Rougham (acreage not stated), and of 81 acres at Elmswell.Wiltshire - Directions have been given for the cleaning and cultivation of three farms, aggregating about 2,000 acres, at Etchilhampton, Stanton St. Bernard and Bratton. Yorkshire, North Riding - Directions have been given to plough up 2,700 acre.s of land which are under two or more years&apos; ley.
In the first fortnight of April the Executive Committee dealt with 94 under-cultivated farms and gave directions or advice to the occupiers of all of them..Anglesey - The Executive Committee have been authorised tc take possession of a badly cultivated farm of 39 acres. Cardiganshire -Arrangements have been made v.ith the owners of home-farms throughout the county, to plough up a considerable quantity of land hitherto used as accommodation land. Radnor - The Executive Committee have been authorised tc take possession of PA acres cf parish lands in the neighbourhood cf Rhayader, hitherto let as accommodation lands, and to let them to small holders.Animal Pests.Several of the County   Committees have taken action with regard to the reduction of rats, sparrows, rooks, and rabbits, on the lines mentioned in last week&apos;s report as having been authorised by the Department.Determination of Tenancies. In 14 cases landlords have been authorised, under the amended Regulation 2M, to determine tenancies where this has been found, on the report of the Executive Committee to be necessary in the interests of increased food supply:    five of these cases relate to neglected small holdings held under County Councils.Cultivaticn of Lands Order, 1917 (No. 2). Reports are now available as regards 802 Boroughs or Urban Districts, and show that, of a total of 132,659 applicants, 112,172 have been supplied with plots aggregating a total area of 8,309 acres.     The Reports continue to show that many plots, both for permanent and temporary cultivation, are being provided by private enterprise independently of the Order.
Arrangements have now been made with the Army Council for the cultivation of the gardens which are attached to houses occupied for military purposes, where such cultivation would not he incompatible with military requirements.    It is hoped that these arrangements will enable Local Authorities to provide plots in many districts, especially large towns, where no other land is available for the purposes of the Order.    Soldiers will be allowed by the military authorities to cultivate the gardens as voluntary workers.Horticultural Section.Horticultural representatives appointed by the Department are now at v;ork in 100 districts.    Expert advice has been provided for a number of Allotment Societies, hospitals, etc. with a view to increasing food production.   A gift of  100 has been received from Sir Frederick Cawley to supplement the gift of  300, to which reference has been made in a previous report, for the purpose of forming Village Food Production Societies in Herefordshire.   These gifts have led to the formation of a large number of Societies, and in one case to the establishment of a permanent endowment fund, the interest of which is to be devoted to assisting food production in the villages.Arrangements are being made to organise the spraying of potatoes grown by small cultivators.    A committee of experts has reported on the most suitable types of spraying machines, and orders are being placed for a large supply.    A Circular has been issued urging the general spraying of potatoes, and giving an outline of the arrangements being made by the Department.II.        TECHNICAL AND ADVISORY. Bulletins on wild white clover and skim milk cheese have been prepared.    The Sub-Committee on Plant Diseases have considered
what steps can be taken, during the coming season, to minimise the damage done to crops by insect and other pests.    Their recommendations are being submitted to the full Committee for consideration.   The, Sub-Committee, appointed to consider the advisability of encouraging the drying of fruit this season, have submitted their Beport.III. LABOUR.A press notice has been issued, calling attention to the provisions of the Agricultural Employment Order, 1917, made by the Board under Regulation 41 AAA of the Defence of the Realm Regulations.   Any person in England or Wales who regularly employs in Agriculture any male person of sixteen years or over, (such employment not being of a casual nature), is required to send notice to the Secretary of the Agricultural Executive Committee for the County on such person ceasing to be employed by him. Military Service (Review of Exceptions) Act, 1917 - The Agricultural Executive Committees have been asked to issue a notice in their local papers telling any agriculturist who received the Statutory Order calling him up for medical examination, to return it -to the Recruiting Officer, endorsing it in the space provided that he claims not to be liable to have the notice sent to him.   The procedure governing the issue of certificates under this Act has not yet been finally settled between the Army Council and this Department.Soldier Labour - The returns so far received show that approximately 40,000 soldiers are now out on agricultural work in England and Wales, including 7,000 men of Agricultural Companies&apos; The Military Authorities have agreed, owing to the inclemency of the weather and consequent delay in ploughing operations, to grant extensions of furlough to soldiers actually at work on farms beyond
30th April, which was the date fixed for their return. The men of the Home Forces, including ploughmen released from all units in the United Kingdom, will remain out until ;-;iay 25th, with the exception of Category &quot;a,! men who will remain out until May 10th only.The Army Council having cancelled their instructions on the subject, soldiers will now retain the whole of their civil earnings, and Commanding Officers have been instructed to give every encouragement to soldiers to volunteer for spare time work, especially for the purpose of assisting Local Authorities in preparing ground for cultivation in the neighbourhood of the men&apos;s stations or billets.Prisoners of,War - The Agricultural Executive Committee for East Sussex has applied for another 20 combatant prisoners to be added to the batch of 75 already at work at Lewes.   These have been voted by the Prisoners of War Committee and directions have been given for their despatch to Lewes.Women&apos;s Branch. The total number of women volunteering under the National Service Scheme for work on the land up to date is 12,631. The Committees are no;;, for the most part, actively engaged in interviewing recruits, but there has not yet been time to obtain from them regular returns as to the numbers selected for immediate employment and for training.    An appeal by the Chairman of the Agricultural Executive Committee in Leicester, through the medium of the local Press, has had a marked effect in enlisting women volunteers for work on the land in that county.MACHINERY SECTION^ ivlotor Tractors - A further 61 tractors have arrived from America bringing the total number of such tractors up to 169 out of the
600 originally ordered through the Rinistry of Munitions. A further 27 privately owned tractors having this week been brought under Government control. The total, number of owned and controlled tractors is now 771.Steam Tackle - Application has been made for a further 8 specially classified men to return to civil employment. During the week 22-men have so returned, bringing the total under this head up to 212.IV.       SUPPLIES. Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Section. In last week&apos;s Report reference was made to the fact that 33,500 tons of superphosphate had been produced in March of this year.    An exact figure for the production in March of last year is not available, but it is estimated that about 50,000 tons were produced in that month. &quot; The production of basic slag in March of this year amounted to 38,500 tons as compared ?/ith about 32,000 in the same month last year.Sulphate of Ammonia - A scheme has been adopted by which the Department will refund to makers a part of the cost of rail and water carriage of all deliveries of Sulphate of Ammonia within the United Kingdom up to 31st May.Enquiry has been made of makers as to their difficulties in securing despatch of Sulphate of Ammonia by rail.    Out of 81 enquiry forms issued, only 28 have been returned, and of these only 4 firms make complaints as to lack of trucks     These 4 cases have been taken up with the Railway Department of the Ministry of Munitions.Superphosphate - A cargo of 4,500 tons of 30y  supe&amp;phosphate purchased by the Department from abroad is expected to arrive towards the end of this month, and arrangements have been made for its disposal through the leading manufacturers in the neighbourhood of the port of arrival.
Potash - The pre-blem.. of supplying potash fertilisers from hwne sources is on its way to solution, and there appears to be a good prospect of supplies being available in the autumn. Lime - About 250 lime firms in England and Wales have been circularised during the week,  and the replies up to the present indicate that production is in all cases limited by lack of labour.     The firms are being asked to employ conscientious objectors, and other assistance in the way of supplying labour will be given.Seeds Section.Seed Potatoes - The weather during the week has been very unsatisfactory fer loading, and potatoes in transit have, in some cases, suffered considerably from frost.A cargo of 2,000 tons from Ireland is now being discharged. A further cargo of 1,500 tons of Irish &quot;seed&quot; is being loaded, and a second consignment of 1,500&apos; tons will be shipped at the end of this week.     Supplies of potatoes from Scotland are now getting short,  and certain Committees who had ordered Scotch seed will be asked to accept Irish potatoes, of which 8,200 tons have now been purchased.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P. President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
