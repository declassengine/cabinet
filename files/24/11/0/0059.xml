TH2 RESTRICTION OF GRAIN FOR HORSES:Supplementary,note by the President of the Board of Trade.With reference to the Memorandum which I circulated yesterday on the proposed restriction of grain for pleasure horses during the summer months, I desire to call the attention of the War Cabinet to the alarming figures of the decrease of stocks of Oats which have been brought to my notice since the memorandum was circulated.    These figures show that between March 1st and April 16th our stock of Oats has been depleted at the rate of 80,000 tons per week, a decrease which, If continued, will absolutely exhaust the stock before the end of May.In these circumstances, it seems to me that not a moment should be lost in sanctioning the proposal of the Inter-departmental Committee which offers a prospect of saving oats and other cereals at the rate of 50,000 tons a month.    This saving will not of course suffice by itself tG meet the situation, but it is a first .and most essential step.A.H.S. 26th April, 1917,
