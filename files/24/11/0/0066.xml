Increased Cropping.The particulars reported during the week are:-White CropGreen CropCounty. AyrAdd total aoreage previously reported . .Total to dateTotal Acreage201 . 562764 S6477IThe Board do not anticipate the cultivation of any further areas of considerable extent for the 1917 crop., compulsory Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M.An order has been issued under 2M UMe) regarding the cultivation of the farm of Kirkton of Forbes, Aberdeenshire.An order has also been issued intimating entry into part of the farm of Mingary, Argyll for cultivation by a neighbouring landholder.3. Labour.As a result of the extended furlough of soldiers engaged on farm work the supply ef labour continues to be satisfactory, but certain classes of soldiers will be recalled to their units very shortly.The most pressing problem during the week has been the supply of lambing shepherds and stallion leaders.   Owing to the highly specialised nature of the work required in connection with lambing, it has been impossible to obtain a sufficient supply of labour, and it is feared that the lack&apos; of skilled shepherds will increase the serious losses amongst ewes and lambs which have been reported in many districts of Scotland.The demands for stallion leaders have for the most part been met.4. Motor Ploughs and Cultivators.Intimation has now been received of the despatch of 9 more Tractors for the use of Committees.An explanatory circular has been issued to Committees regard-ing the scheme previously reported for the supervision of Motor Ploughs and Tractors by the Motor Engineer appointed by the Board.The Board have also issued a circular specifying the terms on which they are willing to provide Cultivators for the use of Committees5. Wild Birds&apos; Eggs.A circular has been issued regarding the possibility of utilising wild birds * eggs as a means of augmenting the supply of eggs for consumption in the country.

Some mis-approhension as to the terms of payment of the. motor engineers seems to have arisen, and I am desired to state again, for the information of your Committee, what the arrangement come to as regards payment actually is.   The terms agreed to between your Committee and farmers who are getting their land ploughed will remain as already fixed, and your Committee will oolleot the sum per acre payable hy the farmer.     It is not suggested that the rate per acre should be revised at this time, although sinoe the matter was first considered all the expenses connected with the upkeep of horses and ploughs, as also the wages of plough-men havo been Increased.     Before another ploughing season oommences it will probably be desirable that your Committee should reconsider the matter of terms in view of the situa-tion as it may then have developed.     Meantime the payment of the 3/- per aore to the motor engineers and !.r..

They will also be responsible for necessary repairs and renewals to the tractor, and for keepin it in good condition, and, as far as possible in constant wor ing order.     It appears to the Board that this skilled super-vision is calculated to secure the maximum of \vork and of ear: ings, and to provide the best safeguard for the capital ad van by them,     Pyom the experience which has been already gained the Board tney ulso have reason to believe that the arrangeme arrived at will take from them a considerable amount of detai work and will relieve your Committee and its officers of some considerable responsibility.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,&apos; H.

ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH.3rd April, 1917.Sir iVild Birds&apos; EggsI am directed by the Board of Agriculture, for Scotland to state that in considering the various means of augmenting the [existing supply of staple foodst their attention has been drawn to Ithe possibility of using as an auxiliary source&apos; of supply the dif-ferent kinds of wild birds&apos; eggs.   Many of the edible varieties, particularly those of gulls, can be gathered   without much trouble or expense in the vicinity of inland lochs and other nesting places, me Board are aware that these eggs have keen used for food to some [extent in the past, but they think that it may be possible, by systematic gathering and regular despatch to the Large consuming rentres, to put the matter on a commercial basis, and thus make tuoh a material contribution to the existing egg supplies as will fend to minimise the present soaroity.The Board think that landowners might help to create an [interest in this proposal among their tenants if it were brought to Iheir notice by your Committee, and I am to state that the Board on fheir part are prepared to assist:(l) by co-operating with proprietors and shooting tenants in leouring such additional labour as may be available   or required to undertake the collection and despatch of eggs,(2) by arranging for the supply of suitable egg boxes at [lentres where the eggs have been gathered in numbers euffioient to justify this course,(3) by taking steps to ascertain the most suitable markets for the eggs.The Board would take it as a favour if your Committee Fould consider the matter and inform them how far it may be joseible to take action on the foregoing lines in your district phie season*I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H. Z * CONACHER,Secretary.Becretary, piatriot Agricultural Exeoutive Committee,Note:   As County Councils are the local authorities under the Wild Birds Protection Acts, it is important that they should be consulted as to local conditions or restrictions and as to whether any withdrawal of protection is necessary.
