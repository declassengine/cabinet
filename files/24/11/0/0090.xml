Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]SECRET.NOTES ON GIBRALTAR AND CEtJTA.Early History of Gibraltar.IT appears to be generally admitted that- Gibraltar was uninhabited until, in 711 a..d., it was oceupied by the Moors after Roderic, King of the Goths, had been defeated by Tarik-Ibn-Zeyad, the commander of the Moorish army sent by Musa-Ibn-Nosseir to invade Andalusia. It remained in the hands of the Moors until 1309, when it was captured by King Ferdinand IV and held by the Spaniards until 1833. The Moors then recaptured it and managed to retain it, in spite of numerous sieges, until 14&apos;d2, when it again passed into Spanish hands.After 1462 Spain kept a firm hold on Gibraltar for more than two centuries, but in 1704, during the war of the Succession, it was taken after a surprise attack by a British squadron commanded by Sir George Rooke, and the Archduke Charles of Austria was pro-claimed the rightful owner of the fortress. As, however, the war of the Succession proceeded, it became clear that the people *of Spain would never accept the Archduke Charles as their King, and when in 1711 he succeeded to the throne of the Holv Roman Empire, and the war ended, there was no longer any question of his retaining Gibraltar. In 1713, by the Treaty of Utrecht, it was finally ceded to Great Britain in the following terms : &quot; The Catholic King does hereby for himself, his heirs, and successors, yield to the Crown of Great Britain the full and entire propriety of the Town and Castle of Gibraltar, together with the port, fortifications, and forts belonging thereto. And he gives up the said propriety to be held and enjoyed absolutely with all manner of right for ever, without anyexception or impediment whatever.....   And in case thepossession of Gibraltar should hereafter be alienated, it is covenanted that a preference, to the entire exclusion of ail other pretenders, shall be given to the Crown of Spain.&quot;Negotiations for the Cession of Gibraltar.Gibraltar had not been in the recognised possession of Great Britain for two years when, in 1715, the first offer to return the fortress to Spain was made by George I, but the conditions were too onerous, and the negotiations were soon broken off.The peace established by the Treaty of Utrecht was, however, clearly not destined to be lasting, and Spain soon alarmed Europe again by the extent of he^warlike preparations. A Quadruple Alliance between Austria, Holland, and Great Britain wasspeedily concluded, and many unsuccessful attempts were made to induce Spain to join it before the British Government made one last effort to maintain peace by again offering to restore Gibraltar, on the sole condition that Philip V should adhere to the Alliance. Philip indignantly rejected the proposal, war followed at once, and it was not until Spain had suffered numerous reverses on sea and on land that she consented to make peace and to join the Quadruple Alliance.Philip&apos;s first act after peace was concluded was to demand the restoration of Gibraltar in accordance with the offer which he had previously rejected. His request was supported by the Regent of Erance, and the British Government, doubtful as to the course which they should pursue, decided to bring forward a motion in 1537] B
Parliament for the restoration of the Rock, so as to sound the temper of the people.The motion was made in March 1720, and excited such a storm of opposition that the Government hastily withdrew it and informed Philip that they had no alternative but to drop the matter for the time being. Nevertheless, the Government still continued to try to find some solution of the question, and it was not long before they brought forward a new proposal the exchange of Gibraltar for Florida.Fortunately, Philip absolutely declined to cede any equivalent whatever for the restoration of the Eock. He insisted upon his right to its possession free of any conditions, and asserted that his only reason for having at length acceded to the Quadruple Alliance was to obtain the fulfilment of the promise that Gibraltar should be returned to Spain.Early in 1721 a letter was received from Philip, saying that his subjects were so turbulent at the terms of the recent treaty of peace that he must request, as an ostensible vindication of his action, a letter from King George promising to restore Gibraltar.Acting on the advice of the Government, the King complied with Philip&apos;s request, and wrote him the following letter on the 29th April, 1721 :-&quot; I no longer balance to assure Your Majesty of my readi&quot; ness to satisfy you with regard to your demand touching the * restitution of Gibraltar, upon the footing of an equivalent, promising you to make use of the first favourable opportunity to regulate this article with consent of my Parliament.&quot;As soon as the letter was received at Madrid the word &quot; equivalent&quot; was declared to be so inadmissible as to render the whole letter useless. King George, urged on by the Government and believing that the document, even with the clause omitted, placed the matter entirely in the hands of Parliament, consented to write Philip a second letter, dated the 1st June, 1721, in these terms: &quot; I do not delay in assuring your Majesty of my readiness to satisfy you as regards the restitution of Gibraltar, promising you that I will avail myself of the first favourable opportunity of settling this point, with the intervention of my Parliament.&quot;No sooner was this second letter received than it formed the subject of a bitter controversy, Philip always maintaining that it constituted an unconditional promise, and King George asserting that it left the question at the discretion of Parliament.For the next few years this misunderstanding prevented any negotiations for an exchange succeeding, and in 1725 Spain entered into an alliance with the Emperor. The Treaty of Alliance contained a secret clause by which the Emperor pledged his good offices to obtain the recovery of Gibraltar and Minorca. This speedily became known in England through the indiscretions of Ripperda, the Spanish Prime Minister, so it was no surprise when the Spaniards laid siege to Gibraltar in February 1727. The siege was a complete failure, but it roused the feelings of the people of England to such a pitch that for thirty years no British Government dared to enter upon fresh negotiations for the restoration of Gibraltar.In 1754 hostilities broke out between England and France. The war dragged on without any striking success on either side, with the exception of the capture of Minorca by the French; and both opponents became anxious to secure the assistance of Spain. It-was in these circumstances that Pitt on the 23rd August, 1757, instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid to enter into negotiations for an Anglo-Spanish alliance, founded on an exchange
of Gibraltar for Minorca, to be effected after iMinorca had been recaptured from the French. The offer was, however, made too&apos; late, and the Spanish Government refused even to consider it. Spain joined hands with Francej and in January 1762 war with Great Britain ensued. British arms were everywhere successful, and by the Peace of Paris of the 10th. February, 1763, we regained possession of Minorca, Guadaloupe, Martinique, and St. Lucia, and acquired in addition Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and Florida.But the peace was of short duration. Early in 1778 France entered into an alliance with the North American Colonies which had seceded from Great Britain, and in 1779 Spain,&apos; eager to profit by our difficulties, joined the. Alliance against us, and the last, longest, and most desperate siege of Gibraltar began.Early in 1780, though hostilities never ceased, some curious-secret negotiations for a separate peace took place between Great Britain and Spain, but they broke down over the question of Gibraltar, and the war continued with unabated vigour. In. 1732 the Spanish Government made another attempt to gain Gibraltar by negotiation on the basis of an exchange for Porto Rico and Oran, and the British Government initiated a debate to test the feeling of the House of Commons. The speeches made in the debate, and public opinion throughout the country, showed the Government that the. surrender of Gibraltar would immediately be followed bv their expulsion from power, and in December 1782 the King, of Spain was informed that no conditions whatsoever would induce the British nation to cede the fortress.In January 1783, a treaty of peace was signed by which Minorca and the two Floridas were restored to. the Crown of Spain,, and the Spanish Government gave up ail hope of obtaining, the restoration of Gibraltar.Spanish Morocco and Ceuta.The position of Spain in Morocco, apart from the possession of her ancient &quot; presidios,&quot; is derived, firstly, from the Franco-Spanish Convention of the 3rd October, 1904, by which Morocco was parti-tioned into two zones of influence, and, secondly, from the Franco-Spanish Agreement of the 18th November, 1912, which extended the i904 agreement, and guaranteed a separate international administration for the town and district of Tangier. By the 1912 agreement the Spanish zone of influence remains technically under the civil and religious authority of the Sultan of Morocco, but the administration of the zone is delegated by the Sultan to a Khalifa chosen by him from a list of two candidates presented by the Spanish Government, without whose consent he cannot be dismissed from his functions, though they have the right to demand his dismissal at any time.The Khalifa resides permanently at Tetuan, and all his administrative acts are controlled by a Spanish High Com-missioner, who is the sole medium of anv communication which the Khalifa in his character of delegate of the Sultan may have to make to foreign officials: Moreover, the Moorish Government, is expressly absolved from all responsibility for any incidents which the Khalifa&apos;s administration may provoke.The Spanish Government have therefore complete control over the administration of the Spanish zone, but they have no sovereign rights over it. Thus, under article 5 of the 1912 agreement, Spam is bound not to alienate, or cede in any manner, even temporarily, her rights in all or any part of the territory comprising the zone,, and under article 6 the two Governments, in order to ensure the free passage of the Straits of Gibraltar, agree to allow no fortifica-tions or strategic works to be erected on that part of the Moorish coast specified in article 7 of the Anglo-French declaration of the 8th April, 1904, respecting Egvpt and Morocco, and article 14 of[537] B 2
the Franco-Spanish Convention of the 3rd October, 1904, i.e., from a point 30 kilometres south-east of Meliila to the heights com-manding the right bank of the River Sebou (north of Rabat on the Atlantic coast). The restriction, which was imposed chiefly by the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government, does not, however, apply to those places which were in 1904 already in the occupation of Spain on the Moorish coast of the Mediterranean.This means, of course,that the Spanish &quot;presidios,&quot; or military districts, of Ceuta and Meliila can be fortified, but that no works can be erected outside their old boundaries.The limits of Ceuta were defined by treaties concluded between Spain and Morocco in 1844 and 1845. They then stopped short where the promontory on which Ceuta is situated juts out from the mainland, but in 1860 they were considerably extended by a further Spanish-Moorish treaty which gave Ceuta a hinterland extending from 2 to 4 miles beyond the town walls, and established a narrow strip of neutral ground just beyond. It is difficult to make out from existing maps exactly where the boundary line ran, but there is no doubt that it was approximately as marked on the map which has been specially prepared for the Committee.The important point to note is that Jebel Mnsa, or Apes Hill, the highest peak in the Sierra Bullones which dominate all the surrounding country, is not included in the district of Ceuta, so that Great Britain in common with the other Powers is pledged, &quot; in order to ensure the free passage of the Straits of Gibraltar,&quot; not to allow this commanding position to be fortified. It is obvious that unless the consent of France and Spain can be obtained to the exemption of Apes Hill from the restriction at present imposed, the possession of Ceuta can never be of much value, and it is somewhat surprising that the Spaniards never seem to have pressed for permission to fortify the hill, hut it may be presumed that they felt that it constituted no danger to them so long as it was in the hands of wild tribes not possessing any artillery.On the 19th November, 1910, a Spanish-Moorish convention was signed, one of the articles of which placed under the authority of a Moorish Governor of the frontier of Oeuta, with a body of 250 native police under Spanish instructors, a zone which, up till, then, had been included in the territorv nominally administered bv the kaid of the Angera tribe. This article was of course inserted in the convention with a view to secure the safety of the Ceuta frontier, and the boundary of the Moorish Governors zone is therefore a matter of some interest, even though the convention has since been superseded by the Franco-Spanish Agreement of 1912.The Spanish military authorities first insisted on a line extend-in g from Point Alcazar to the mouth of the Rio Negro ; but as the French Government Avere thought to be much opposed to any police interference with the Angera tribe in their mountain strong-holds, the Spanish Government eventually accepted a line running from Cape Ciris to the River F^enidal. Both these lines are marked with approximate accuracy on the accompanying map, and they may be of some value when discussing the boundary of a possible British Ceuta.The great difficulty of fixing any such boundary is that there appears to be no possible solution which, will not divide into two the Angera tribe, Avhose territory runs practically from Ceuta to Tangier. Spain has been quite unable to win over the Angera by pacific means, and there is not at present much prospect of her being able to force them into subjection, especially if she is to lose Ceuta as a base of operations. We, on the other hand, should doubtless be able to manage the Angera if the whole tribe were included in our sphere; but the difficulties would be immense if, just across our border, the greater part of the tribe were still revel-ling in the complete lawlessness which prevails throughout the Spanish zone.
Any boundary-line must of course be drawn so as to include Riucon-del-Medik.Tangier,The future of the international zone at Tangier is another very difficult problem, which is closely connected with that of Ceuta.On the one hand so long as the exclusive possession of Tangier is at the back of the minds of both the French and Spanish Governments, the position of the International Municipality must always be somewhat unstable. On the other hand, there are really only two alternatives to internationalisation, for neither France or Spain would ever allow Tangier to become British. The alter-natives are of course that it should become Erench or Spanish, and there are grave objections to both.Erom the point of view of the future of the port itself it would undoubtedly be far better off in French than in Spanish hands, for it would be infinitely better administered and developed. Moreover, the French have from some points of view a &quot;good case in claiming that French interests predominate in Tangier, and that France has therefore really the best right to it if any one nation is to acquire it. In respect to British interests, however, a Erench Tangier is the worst solution. Our trade there would be stifled much more speedily and effectively than it would be by the Spaniards, and it could only be a matter of time before France set to work to absorb the remainder of the Spanish zone.The disadvantages of a Spanish Tangier would be complete stagnation of the port, inefficiency and corruption in administration, and native unrest.Conclusion.The main difficulties in the way of arranging an exchange of Gibraltar and Ceuta, if such an exchange is desired by the naval and military authorities, will be, firstly, public opinion in England, and, secondly, France.It is difficult to estimate how strongly people in England may still feel about Gibraltar, but there is no doubt that on every previous occasion on which the cession or exchange of Gibraltar has been considered, the Government of the day have completely under-estimated the force of public opinion, with the result that they have been compelled, often with, great difficulty and embarrass-ment, to withdraw from the negotiations with Spain. It is possible that the lapse of more than a century, and the knowledge which everyone has acquired during the present war of the effects of long range lire, may have reconciled the people to the idea of giving up Gibraltar. It is certain that many would advocate an exchange; but there would remain an enormous amount of prejudice to be overcome. Mr. Gibson Bowies is not a monument of sagacity, but he is often a very faithful mirror of a large section of public opinion, and there is probably a great deal of truth in the following extract from an article written by him in 1901:-&quot; There is probably no spot on earth outside the British islands certainly there is none of similar extent which the British people prize so highly as Gibraltar. Strategists may contend that, for all useful purposes, Ceuta would be as good and Minorca better, and there is, indeed, much to be said for such a contention; but nothing would ever persuade the British people to part with the Hock in exchange for either of those two positions, nor for much more to boot. To them Gibraltar represents at once the glory of the past, the power of ttie present, the security for the future. To them it seems the surest sign of naval predominance to have held it for nigh on 200 years; the most certain pledge of searule to continue to
lioid it. They entertain the settled conviction that upon the retention of it depends, not alone the naval position of Great Britain in the Mediterranean, but also her access to the East and to the Suez Canal and her security on the Adriatic. Moreover, apart from all this, they have a sentiment about it which, even if it were unreasonable, could not be reasoned with.&quot;It may be contended that Gibraltar does not represent &quot; the power of the present,&quot; at any rate to the same extent as in 1901; but, even if British public opinion can be reconciled to the change, there will remain the problem of how to make it palatable to Prance.It is certainly in favour of the exchange that our appearance in Morocco would make it impossible for France ever to carry into effect any schemes which she may be maturing for the absorption of the Spanish zone. But the French will be fully alive to this, and in all probability the acquisition by Great Britain of a footing in Morocco is about the last thing France desires. The French colonial party is at present exceedingly strong and active, and France is, of course, fully entitled to have a say in any alteration of the present position in Morocco; for, apart from the clause in the Franco-Spanish Agreement of 1912 by which Spain undertook not to cede any part of her Moorish zone, there is also the Mediterranean Agreement of 1907, by which France, Great Britain, and Spain reciprocally undertook to maintain their existing terri-torial rights in the Mediterranean and to consult with each other in case any change was decided upon.So, even if France, underpressure, allows us to acquire Ceuta itself, she will certainly not permit us to fortify Apes Hill, or to obtain a reasonable hinterland, without demanding compensation. Possibly if we were to support Spain&apos;s claim to Tangier, the satis-faction of the two great Spanish aspirations Gibraltar and Tangier  would enable the Spanish Government to find something to give France, e.g., a rectification of the southern boundary of the Spanish zone, Ifni, the Canaries, or the Balearic Islands. It is barely conceivable that Great Britain could ever consent to the acquisition by France of either the Canary or the Balearic Islands; but, assuming that this were possible, and that Spain were to get both Tangier and Gibraltar, we should certainly not be content with Ceuta and nothing else. Meliila would be of use to us, not only as a port but especially on account of the iron ore in the surrounding district, which might be invaluable to us in a future war; but this again would increase French claims. Moreover Italy would undoubtedly not accept in silence such far-reaching alterations in the Mediterranean.The difficulties of negotiating- an exchange are obviously immense.DROGHEDA.Foreign Office,April 25, 1917.
