Savoy Hotel,29th April 1917.Dear Sir Maurice Kankey,In response to the invitation of the War Cabinet for an expression of my views on the general strategical and military situation as well foS&quot;of my impressions of my recent visit to the 7/estern front, I enclose a brief memorandum.    I may add that my impres-sions of the Western front were embodied in a letter to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the 13th instant immediately on my return, and the substance of my letter was a6ain embodied by him in his memorandum of the 17th instant to the War Cabinet.   For the con-venience of the Cabinet, however, I summarise my im-pressions a^ain in the memorandum enclosed herein.Yours sincerely, (Sd) J.C. Smuts.Lieut,Colonel Sir M. Eankey, ICC.Bc , Secretary,Imperial Defence Committee,
THE GENERAL STRATEGIC AID MILITARY SITUATIONandPARTICULARLY THAT ON THE &apos;.7S STERN JRONT.General, The present strategic and military situation isdetermined not only hy the previous course cf the war but to a large extent also by our conception of general policy, by the political aims we are fi6htin0 for, and the possibility of vigorously defining and limiting those aims.A military situation which is hopeless in view of a large and ambitious political programme may yet be quite hopeful and reassuring if that programme is severely cut down to the essential minimum of our war aims and of the victory ^re consider necessary to realize them-       Such a definition and. limitation of our war-aims hes now become quite necessary at this very late stage of this lonto and exhausting struggle and has been oarried out by two committees of the &quot;7ar Cabinet. Apart from the subsidiary recommendations of those committees our war aims are now limited to the follow-ing four :-(a) Destruction of the German colonial system with a view to the future security of all communications vital to the British Empire. This has already been done - an achievement of enormous value which ought not to be en-dancered at the peace negotiations.(b) Tearing off from the Turkish Empire all parts that may afford Germany opportunity of expansion to the Far East and of endangering our position as an Asiatic Pc?/er.   This hasessentially
essentially been achieved, although the additional conquest of Palestine may he necessary to complete this task, (o) Evacuation by the enemy of Belgium, Northern Prance, Serbia, Montenegro and Roumania, and compensation to Belgium and perhaps France and Serbia.(d) A settlement of Europe which will limit or destroy the military predominance of the Germanic powers, though the actual details of such a settlement may be left open for the peace conference.The last two aims have still to be achieved.   The net result of the war so far may be stated as follows: while all other parties have been heavy losers in territory both the German and tho British Empires have been vinners, the one in Central Europe, the other over the rest of the globe.   &quot;Thile our gains have immensely strengthened our position the risk remains that the German Empire may have gained even more relatively and, unless defeated now, will become a0ain at some future date an even more serious menaoe to us than it has been in the past. How has this defeat to be brought about?I have already told the 7ar Cabinet and I repeat here my frank opinion that that will not be merely or even entirely a military defeat. A certain -substan-tial measure of military success will be necessary and must be achieved not only because it is necessary for our ends but also as a lasting lesson to Prussian militarism,3ut greater forces are fi^htin^ for us than our armies.     This war will be settled largely by theimponderables
-3-Imponderables. * by tho f orc^s^rtf ^l^ic &quot;tfpini^^ &quot;&apos;the wortjt^-rfliifih^to by German outrages, byfear on the part cf the governing classes of Central Europe of the dark forces of revolution already gathering in the background, by the gaunt spectre cf w.nt or even starvation already stalking through the land: and by all those eonse-quential factors of morals to which even Fapclecn attached more military importance than to the prowese of his armies. Thus tho present impotence of the Russian army is almost balanced and in the end may be more than balanced by the, dread which this example of successful revolution is in-spiring in the rulers of Central Europe.   And the coming in of even pacific America shows the growing force of the imponderables set free by this war in the minds of the nation.In this connection two considerations cannot be too olearly realised by us.   First, that in our diplomacy and our conduct of the war we should ever strive to keep this wcrld opinion on our side and not be deflected by German methods of barbarism or in any other way from our true course.   This affects such questions as the severer forms of reprisals,  our coercion of small neutral nations,  and even an added emphasis to our traditional generous policy in purely domestic affairs, and similar questions.   Second, that the imponderables will continue to act beyond the duration of this war and produce greater changes than any which we will be able to achieve or even contemplate in the peace treaty.   It appears now fairly probable that the deraocratisation of Central Europe, which will be an inevi-table consequence of this war, will go further to achieve our war aim (d) than any measures we could devise.But,
Sut, even so, a substantial measure of military success rail be necessary for the attainment of our ends (c) and (ah   How is this to be achieved?   And this brings me to tho consideration of the present strategic and military situation.In this connection the dominant fact that emerges is that our scope for military operations has become consider-ably narrowed down as the war has progressed.   Possibilities of offensive action which at earlier stages of tho war were opon to us are no longer possible and several brilliant idoas will now not be put to the test of trial.   On tho contrary even our present fields of operation nay have to be revised and contracted.     The warnings of the Pirst Sea Lord as to the naval and shipping position have become so gravo and insistent that it would be dangerous in the extreme to con-tinue to ignore them indefinitely.   Che question therefore arises, whioh cf our overseas campaigns is the least promising to the attainment of our ends and makes the heaviest demands ^Salonika.on our shipping,   This undoubtedly is the Salonika campaign, which has failed in its original intention, and will more and mora become not only a military and naval but possibly also a political embarrassment.   Apart from a victorious offensive which may serious^ threaten Sofia I can see only two advantages arising from this campaign:    (a) it may support our diplomacy in endeavouring to detach Bulgaria from tho Central Powers, (b) it may serve as a cover to Greece and prevent tho Germans from reaching it and gathering-fresh resources in men and submarino bases and lairs on the G-roek coast and islands.V/ita our present forces on that front I consider a roal threat to Bulgaria out of tho question.   She strategicgeographical position in Central Sirope is such that theBalkan/
Balkan front should either he one of our most formidable in men and guns or should he left alone altogether.     Any middle course such as we have adopted is either futile or dangerous.As regards the detachment of Bulgaria from the Germans hy adequate territorial baits, that is a question for our diplomacy to decide;    if there is no real prospect of such detachment we have no military reason to linger on this front except for the purpose of covering Greece. And the covering of Greece might well be left to the French, Serbians and Italians on a contracted front.      In this way we would secure several clear advantages:    we would ease the shipping situation, we would extricate ourselves from what promises to become a most embarrassing political entanglement in Greece for which French diplo-macy with purely French aim3 in view is responsible;    and we would be enabled to reinforce our front in Palestine, which will require heavy reinforcing before the conquest of Palestine and Syria is completed.&apos; Tho question for immediate consideration of the Foreign Office is whether the detachment of Bulgaria is possible:    if it can be and is brought about the Salonika campaign would not remain as a further addition to our list of failures.     And a Bulgaria which is not only powerful and nationally satisfied but which has played Germany false at the most critical stage of the war will be a great factor in the future settlement of the Balkans, quite apart from the immediate military advantages.     If possible the effort should be made.    If not, then I can only advise a change of our plans, and our retirement from this front in such stages as will not endanger the position of our allies who will remain on the contractedfront/
391-6-front.     The Balkan situation has now become primarilya diplomatic one, and our military policy should be revisedaccordingly.Ifext   in importance to the detachment of Bulgariafrom Central Europe would be the detachment of Turkeywhich might become feasible if the Russian Government -would definitely waive their rights under the Bosphorusagreement.   The danger, however, Of Russia going out of thewar on some pretext or other is so serious and would havesuch far reaching consequences that I do not think weshould moot the question with her at present, but leave thesituation to clear Up of itself in the course of events.$Tagging is the worst form of dealing with a patient.   Itherefore proceed on the assumption that our campaignagainst the Turkish Empire will continue in full vigour.H^iopotamia.     As regards Mesopotamia, we have achieved all thatwe were aiming at and can now consolidate our pra itionand make it,impregnable to any future counter-attacks.General Maude should at the most convenient point onthis front select and prepare a strong defensive positionfor any future eniergerufy, while continuing the pressurefurtheragainst the enemy/afield.    If we could ration portion of the Russian army on this front we could attach them more closely to us and thus increase our offensive power and tighten our hold on Russian co-operation in our future moves in this theatre.     But essentially our ends here have been attained for the present, and it will depend on the progress of the Palestine army whether the more ambitious effort of a junction of our forces from the Euphrates with those in Syria should be made thereafter.     Any large reserves from India, instead of being locked up on this front, might
be held back until we see how the Palestine campaign progresses and how its requirementsde^elop.This Palestine campaign presents very interesting military and even political possibilities.   As it pro-gresses to Jerusalem and Damascus, it will threaten the Turkish Empire far more gravely than anything we have so far undertaken except the Dardanelles and Gallipoli campaign.     We should therefore be prepared for the most obstinate resistance, and it is essential for us tojconternplate the gradual aut complete withdrawal of our forces from Salonika to this front.   This transfer will also have the effect of our making less use of the dangerous Mediterranean for our oversea operations, as the Palestine army could be largely supplied from the East, Australia and South Africa, and the ships now used in East Africa will also soon be set free for this purpose.   The contraction of the Salonika front and the increasing pressure in Palestine must obviously have the effect of bringing the whole of the Turkish forces to the Asiatic fronts of the Turkish Empire. It must be clearly realised that unless the Russians are made to pull their full weight in Armenia and General Maude continues to threaten the enemy on his front the Palestine force is certain to meet with the most formidable opposition even before it reaches Jerusalem.     In any case, if we adopt a vigorous offensive we must be prepared to face the fact that this front will in all probability assume an importance eventually second only to that of the Western front. The coming campaign must be judged and appreciated from that point of view to prevent future surprises or dis-appointments.
Western Eront.There remains for consideration the far moreImportant and complicated question of the Western Front. I have always looked upon it as a misfortune, no doubt inevitable under the circumstances that the British forces have become so entirely absorbed by this front. The result now 1b that in a theatre mainly of the enemy&apos;s choosing, the two most important armies of the Entente are locked up in front of almost impregnable positions. It is essential to our ends that we should keep the initiative and offensive, but both are enormously difficult in the situation in wbich*we are placed on this front. I have no confidence that we can break through the enemy line on any large scale.   Ho doubttwith our predominance of heavy artillery we can batter in any selected portion of the enemy line, but in every case so far we have been unable to advance for more than a comparatively short distance, and there is no reason to think that this state of affairs will materially alter in the near future unless some unforeseen calamity overtakes the enemy.     I found the spirit of &quot;bojb our officers and men on this front magnificent in Its confidence and determination.     By my visit has only strengthened my impression that a decision on this front can only be reached by a process of remorselessly wearing down the enemy.   And that is a very slow, costly and even dangerous process for us no less than for the enemy and threatening both with exhaustion of nw&amp;n-power as the process of attrition goes on.     Victory in this kind of warfare i3 the costliest possible to the victor.My visit to this front has also impressed me with the undesirability of the present position both as regards the supreme military direction and the state of our strategic reserves. On both these points I xm&amp;m.-ny views immediately after my return to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and they have been largely
394incorporated into Ms important Memorandum of 17th. April to the War Cabinet (0.1.-95/374) which has no doubt received tho most careful consideration.     These views I shall briefly repeat here.We entered the War in a very small way with a small military force and not as a principal  -combatant but rather as an auxiliary to France, This fact was reflected in our general military policy which was of necessity one of great modesty and almost complete subordination to that of France. Our Army took its position side by side with the French Army in defence of French soil and as our forces continued to grow, we proceeded to take over more and more of the French line.     The modesty of our policy and the subordination of our role to that of France have continued notwithstanding the fact that during the last two years the whole situation has been transformed and we are now the -principal opponent of the Central Empires and the financial, naval, and, to a large extent, the military mainstay of the Entente.     This anomalous situation is now reflected in threo curious respects.1.     While our Army is defending the soil of France as if it were part of the French Forces, the French have taken the military and diplomatic lead in the Balkans and Greece and are either making mistakes which are seriously embarassing the success of the War in those parts, or, if success is achieved, are after the War going to enjoy all the prestige in the Balkans which should legitimately have gone to the most powerful and disinterested member of the Entente.2.    The strategy of our Army on the Western Front has to conform to French direction, althoughsuch
such direction may, from a review of the militarysituation as a wholo, not he a sound one and maypay an undue regard to merely French considerations.There is also the danger with an unstable Government, constantlysuch as France/has, that there may he vacillation in this direction and that rivalries between French commanders may impair its efficiency, while we ere bound to conform end obey.3. But the most serious result of all is thatour whole Army (with the exception of the Forces conducting campaigns elsewhere) has been locked up on the Western Front and we have no great strategic reserve left for any unforseen contingencies.     For no doubt good and sufficient reasons we have gradually shouldered more and more of the burden of defending&apos; France and so both the French and English Armies have become pinned down along the present Western Front.     The Germans probably have great reserve forces v/hich they could fling either against one of the existing fronts or into some new diversion into which they may be driven in order to achieve success.If any such diversion is made by the enemy v/here is our force to meet it?     If, again, any. great diversion planned by us may, at some later stage of the War present the promise of docisive success, we shall be impotent to execute it because we shall have left no reserve force in our hands to play with.     It is fair that any such reserve force should be found by us and that to the French should be left their legitimate task of defending French soil as far es their power permits,I consider the time has come for us to aimresolesfc7 r-^   the removal of these three anomalies.We should endeavour to recover the diplomatic lead,especially
33especinlly in the Balkans; we should, after the present offensive, resume the independence of our military direction: and, above all, we should aim at the liberation from the Western front at an earlydate,  of at least one of our armies which should remain in the north of France, or the neighbourhood of the Belgian border as a strategic reserve to be used only when necessary in the case of grave contingencies.   A great force, such as ours, which has no strategic reserve, is running grave risks.   The German strategic reserve last December could deal with Roumania as soon as the danger of her invading Transylvania arese, and we should be in a similar position of security against unforeseen develop-ments.These impressions which I brought from the front have since been reinforced by the rumour that several important members of the French Government do not approve of General Eiveiled present offensive and consider a defensive policy the wisest one for the French army to pursue.   If this policy is carried out and is applied also to the British Army, it means that towards the end of the third year of the war,  the enemy has still succeeded in reducing us to the defensive. This, coupled with the fact that the enemy forces are now more numerous than ever before,  that they have con-quered large parts of Entente territory, which they are still holding, and that the submarine campaign, already bo grave, is growing in violence, would look very much like our defeat, would dishearten all the Entente nations whose discouragement might precipitate serious peace movements among one or more of them.   And once the rot sett in, it might be difficult to stop it.   No doubt, the weight of America would be felt in 1918, but the danger is that we may not get there, unless active operationsare
- 3.2 ttare presented and a continuance of military success buoys up the spirit of the nations to fight on till America can come in as a decisive factor.      I feel tho danger of a purely defensive policy so gravely that I would make the following suggestions in case the French carry out such a policy.      In that case we should make them take back a substantial part of their line now occupied by us.     As they would require no greatiBserve for offensive purposes, they would be in a position to do so.     Our forces should then be concentrated towards the north, and part should go to the rear as a strategic reserve, while the rest should endeavour to recover the northern coast of Belgian and drive the enemy from Zeebrugge and Ostond. This taiik will be most formidable, especially if both the Russian and French lines remain passive, and every pressure should be exerted to induce them to be as aggressive as possible, even if they cannot actually assume the offensive.     But, however difficult the task, something will have to be done to continue our offensive, and I see more advantages in an offensive intended to recover the Belgian coast and deprive the enemy of two advanced submarine bases, than in the present offensive, vrhich in proportion as it succeeds in driving the enemy out of France, will make the French less eager to continue the struggle be3&apos;ond that goal.     If the French are determined to go on the defensive, our (British) task on the Western front may become so difficult that the Cabinet may decide to abandon the further prosecution of the Palestine campaign and to bring our Salonika troops as reinforcements to our Western Front.I mention this here because I consider the time is now rapidly approaching *rhen the military situation/as
3as a whole will have to he most carefully reviewed hy the War Cabinet and oixcumst/anoes may force them to contract their-military fronts even more than was above suggested. We aro approaching the final stages of this long-drawn out struggle, whon we cannot afford to make any more nis-takes, and when any false move made by either side may well prove decisive and fatal to it,6e0OflTIK- And this is the reason why I am so anxious to seea prcp-er strategic reserve established.   The chapter of accidents in war is a long and curious one, and many a struggle has been settled by something unfor-seon happening near the ond.      We want a reservej foroe to provide against surprises and accidents andalso to bo in a position to make use of any good opportunity which may present itself for offensive action on our part.     Are there any probable contin-gencies to provide against?     I understand the liability of this Island to an invasion has been carefullyI considered and providod against.   In any case, anyI such desperato attempt would only be mado at the veryend, when Germany doos no longer mind risking the destruction of her ITavy in a pitched naval battle andj the cutting off and capture of any large landing force.i But another contingency which also requires carefulconsideration is the enemy invasion of Holland in order to secure food, new submarine bases at Antwerp and Rotterdam, and new counters to bargain with when poacej comes.    The Dutch army is not a formidable factor,1 the Dutch artillery is known to the Germans to becontemptible, and after driving America into tho war,1 they are not likely to boggle over Holland.   Ourj capture of Ostend and Seebrugge may make it even moreimperative for them to seek new submarine bases for I their/
their expanding submarine activities.   If the Dutchterritory along the Scheldt is violated and Hollandappeals to us for help, we must have the necessaryreserve to do so.   At present we have not, and inany disaster to her vre shall have to abandon Hollandto her fate and look on while the enemy acquires newbases for his attacks against us.   I could evenconceive ciicumstances ?/hich may compel us to dragHolland, however unwillingly,  into the war in orderto achieve victory: but it means a large reservebeing ready and prepared for use either in that orany other emergency.   I do not say the3e thingsare very likely, but in war the improbable alsorequires careful consideration.   And the positionof Holland as affecting the present strategic situationdoe3 call for the most minute Expert consideration,which I trust is being given it.   I am not sufficient-ly acquainted with the Scandinavian states to saywhether they also require consideration.   All I wishto emphasise is the necessity for a large reserveforce and its possible uses.   *f victory is unfortu-nately impossible for us this year - and it may be,in view of the fact that the Germans must strainevery nerve to obtain a decision before the weight ofAmerica can be felt next year - such a reserve will bean insurance against any serious accident and may thushelp us to hold out till America could come effective-ly to our aid.   And if victory is possible this year,such a reserve may well prove the decisive- factor.   Itwill mean much for our future prestige if (as atWaterloo) we are in a position to strike the final blows.&apos; REVIEW OF     The point I would emphasise finally for the POLICYPESSARY.attention of the War Cabinet is that the time hascome
29th April,1917.come, or is corning soon, when the strategic situation, both military and naval, in relation to our resources and diplomacy, should be reviowo&amp; as a whole and, so far as is possible, a definite policy should be laid down on the points raised in this memorandum as well as on others which I have refrained from referring to.   Unless the First Sea Lord and the Chief of tho Imperial General Staff hare the clear guidance of the :.7ar Cabinet on general questions of policy, it is impossible for them to obtain the highest and most efficient power out of the war machine they are directing.(Initialled)   J.C.S.
