TOGOLAND.

Note by the Colonial Office.



Togoland was taken with very little assistance from the French, whose Colony of Dahomey adjoins it on the East as ours of the Gold Coast does on the West.

The provisional division with the French gives them a larger area than that allotted to us; but we have Lome, the only port of any importance and the terminus of three railway lines. In this respect the position is the converse of that in the Cameroons, where the French have Duala, the port and railway terminus.



?095/14.

Sir Hugh Clifford is of opinion that any permanent division of the country must depend on who gets Lome, as the holder of Lome should also have the districts through which the railways run.

Therefore, if no retain Lome, we should get, in addition to what we hold under the provisional arrangement, the provinces of Anecho and Atakpane, giving the French "some adjustment" of their boundary in the North.

If the French are to have lome, then all Sir H. Clifford proposes is an extension of the old boundary so as to include the Dagomba country in the North, and what he calls the Peki District in the south - also some extension in the extreme South in the Awuna country. the reason for these extensions is that the Dagomba, Peki, and Awuna tribes are divided by the old Anglo-German boundary.

Unfortunately we have no map showing his desiderata in the Peki and Awuna districts, but they are roughly shewn on the marked map.
