SEASON 1918.Memorandum by.Chief Secretary for Ireland.For the 1917 Season, a regulation under the Defence of the Reair Act required&apos; that 10 per cent, or about one million acres, of.all pastures in Ireland on farms ever ten acres should be put under the plough before 31st December next. Owing to. the 3ate period at which this regulation was made, to the lack of horses, tractors and implements, and to the unexpected severity of the season, a somewhat large portion of this extra 10% must remain unploughed until the coming autumn.For the Season 1918 it is proposed to make obligatory the ploughing of the balance of the area of 10 per cent ordered to be ploughed in 1917, plus an additional 5 Per cent, or a total increase over the area ploughed in 1916 of not less, and probably more than, 1,500,000 acres;    and an increase over the acreage in 1917 of about 1,000,000 acres.     This added to the area normally ploughed will make a total of practically 4,000,000 acres under tillage, exclusive of rotation grass lands.     This is probably as much new.,pillage as could Well be done, but even further increase &quot;ho doubt possible.If the Irish Department are in a position to give farmers an assurance that an adequate supply of tillage requisites will be forthcoming next season, or at any rato that the Government will take steps to see that Ireland gets a fair proportion of whatever is available, the Department have no doubt that they can induce Irish farmers to fulfil the programme.     But if the disappointment experienced this winter in obtaining implements and a fair share of manures is to be repeated in the coming season it will be impossible to carry out the work.It is desirable that these proposals should be considered in connection with plans for the rest of the United Kingdom.   Agriculturally, Great Britain and Ireland are interdependent, especially as regards live stock.     This involves consideration of the needs and capabilities of the United Kingdom as a whole, and of whatjeach should do in the common interest.     The following questions in particular require attention :-1.     The proportion of the tilled land that should be put under -2.     To what extent should stock raising give place to corn growing?
3.   Mustlreland prepare tor a large redaction in the demand from Gt.Britain for store cattle?In this connection note must be taken of the fact that grazing in Gt.Britain is to be reduced while a proportionate amount of wheat straw will become available.    frill an increased import of Irish cattle into Great Britain be needed to make this into manure to maintain the fertility of the corn lands?4.   Milk, as well as corn, is of vital necessity. Is it desirable that each country should see to its own supply of cows for winter milk production and of the necessary roots and fodder?5.   In view of the increasing scarcity of concentrated cattle foods (millers offal and cake) is it not desriable to increase largely the area under roots and other crops suitable for milk production even at the expense of corn.aboveTo put into effect the/proposal to plough up 1,000,000 acres of grass land in tho year 1917-18, it would be needful that the Government should secure for the agriculturists of Ireland, through the various Departments concerned, the following indispensable requirementsPHOSPHATES-WM&amp;mmS. A regular monthly supply to Irish iiiunufucEutstb of superphosphate of 6,000 tons pyrites and 10,000 tons rock phosphate.This would have to bo supplementedSby an import from Gt.Britain of at leaSt 75,000 tons of basic slag for the year.     In the event of a shortage of Pyrites and Phosphatic rock for the manufacture in Ireland of the requisite amount of superphosphate, a higher proportion of the available basic slag will be necessary.SULPHATE OF AMMONIA.     Of this fertiliser, 30,000 tons would be required out of the total of 200,000 estimated as likely  o be available.POTASH.     Tillage in Ireland, particularly the potato and flax crops, have suffered greatly for want of potash. Whatever quantity is available for 1918 crops, the Department ask that it should be distributed in proportion to the area of potatoes and *lax in the two countries.IMPLH3CTTS.   A; supply of 500 tractors . i   .^&apos;H!uTcrHluTtable ploughs and other implements, including harvesting machinery.Groat difficulty v/as experienced this season in obtain-ing sufficient horses, tractors and ploughs.     Tractors were not available until very late, and in any case their cost was too high in proportion to the size of the holdings.     If the new Ford machine can be sold for  90 it would cone within the means of raany farmers who could not afford to buy those imported this year.MILLING PLANT.     Facilities for local drying and milling of oats so that oatmeal can be made available for fooft.SPRAYING MTERIALS.    Provision should be made to supply 9,000 tons of sulphate of copper and about 11,000
-3-tons of soda crystals, as well as 10,000 spraying machines.FINMOB.     A money grant for general administration and inspection.An advance for the purpose of loans to farmers and to enable the Department to order in bulk such require-^: merits as cannot be secured by individual farmers or merchants owing to difficulties of manufacture or of transit *(Intld.)   H.E.D.27th April, 1917
