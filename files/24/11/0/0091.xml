GREEIILAIU BY C-RZAT BRITAIil.( ote by The Hon. J,D. Hazen, Hinister ox Ilarlne and Fisheries, Canada).Tnile Greenland remains in the possession of Denmark or one of the smaller nations the matter is not one of great importance,, but looking to the future Greenland is likely to become of considerable importance to the British Empire, and in view of the fact that Denmark has recently disposed of its islands in the -nest Indies to the United States and that a redistribution of territorial possessions will probably take place at the close of the war, the present seems to be an opportune time to give consideration to this question..At present, ships crossing the Atlantic in the summer season by the northern route pass within a few hundred miles of the Greenland coast,* When the Hudson Bay Railway is com-pleted and 0rain and other products are carried from the west-ern provinces of Canada to the markets of Europe by this route they will pass much closer than they do at present to the shores of the country in question.&apos;-7ith the improvement in aviation and the development in that respect for commercial purposes that will follow the war, it is within the bounds of probability that before lonb airships may at regular intervals cross the Atlantic, in which case Greenland would prove a convenient and important station on a Trans-Atlantic aerial route from Great Britain to America which might start from Scotland and pass through Iceland and Greenland to Newfoundland ?nd Canada.From a strategic standpoint Greenland.is important,, as the southern end of the.island might be very &quot;rell suited for the location of a high-power wireless station,, and in view of the control or direction of submarines and aircraft this con-si deration will become of increasing importance as years go by.    If at the present time Germany had possessed a fortified wireless station and a base for submarines on Greenland our difficulties rrould have been very much increased and our patrol of the Straits of Belle Isle, the St. Lawrence route and of the Atlantic coast &quot;*ould have been rendered much more difficult than it now is.-I am submitting this matter for the consideration of the Sub-Committee of the Imperial vrar Cabinet which is deaiin0 with the question of territorial changes after the war.   Tnile froma
a natural geographical standpoint- Greenland, should, be in-eluded in British north America, it is desirable for other reasons as ir:ell as the above that if possible Greenland should be acquired by Great Britain and placed under the control and form part --*.  the Dominion of Canada.I have not referred to the commercial advantages that would result if this acquisition was found possible, though I believe that the fisheries and mineral&apos;potential-ities of the country are not inconsiderable and are capable of development under i&apos;rise and progressive administration.Anril 20th, 1917.(Sd) J. D. HAZEI.
