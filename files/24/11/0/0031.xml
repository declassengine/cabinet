S E C R E T.Report from Brig.-Genl. Poole on Military Equipment Section in Russia.On the whole the situation shows an improvement inthe last 10 days as everything has been perfectly quiet here and the factories are all in work.hands of the Regimental Committees, and the Men are absolutely masters of the situation.Laot week I attended a Meeting of the Social Democratic Union with a view to Discussing the situation aspolite and gave me the attached paper - Appendix I - which represented their views as regards the war.   They expressed a wish that the Workmen of England should be fully informed as to their opinions.  .It was interesting to note that they were emphatic on the point that they were basters of the Government, and considered that they had absolute power to veto or approve any Government measure. I.attach the more credence to this statement as it coincides with the impression I invariably form in my conversations with Mr. Goutchkcff, Minister of War. . He has on several occasions stated quite frankly that the Government are unable to interfere on various questions because of the power, of the Workmen and Soldiers.   * Por example,  on my last visit to him, by desire of H.E. the&apos; Ambassador^ I showed him an anonymous letter which had been sent to the Embassy by some Russian iTaval Officers who were prisoners at ICronstadt,  and which detailed their sufferings, and asked if some help oould be given by the British. Goutchkoff said he was afraid that the statements were practically&apos; true and that he was doing his best to get them released. He feared, though,  that if he interfered   openly,  the only result would be the death of the Officers at the hands of the lien.,The question of discipline of the Troops heredoes not inspire me with confidence as all matters are in thefar as work in the Factories is concerned.    They were veryOn tho
TheOn the other- hand, I saw a teiegram at the Ministry of War yesterday, sent by Brusiloff which said that, after consultation with his Army, Corps&apos;and Divisional Commanders, they&apos; were convinced that; an Offensive was not only practicable but in view of their obligations to the Allies, desirable. They said that the Workmen of Petrograd did not represent the feelings of Russia, and that the Armies at the front were the deciding factors In the situation.The Members of the Government have gone down to the Stavka with a view, I understand, to clearly explaining the situation to the Troops at the Front, and obtaining their firm support.     If they are successful we may hope for a general improvement in the matter of discipline.As regards our own particular interests here - the situation is as follows:-Romanoff and Murman Railway.&apos; Vl&apos;/;.&apos;: . &apos; V-V,:        .: &apos;The Minister of Railways fully realises the conditions at Romanoff and on the railway and has sent his best Engineer - Bogashoff - up there to try and improve matters.The following list shows a slight improvement during thelast 10 days and, if the thaw does not break up the line, I hope it will still further Improves-No of trains March 19/21   March 22/24   March 25/27despatched     ...... 7 .. 9 9Tonnage despatchedon above trains     ...       1,070        ..    1,412       ..    1,430&apos;Wo of ships waitingto discharge      &quot;... 16        ...        17 17Tonnage discharged waiting for.railway transport    ...      ...       8,500 ,.    8,700 9,000
