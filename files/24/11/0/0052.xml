[This Document is fee Property of His Brit&amp;egis MageBty&apos;g Gorarnment]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   April 1917.HATE OF AMMONIA.IT ik desirable to arrange a scheme for the manufacture, storage, and distribution n! sulphate o- ammonia for the season June 1917 to May 1918.The Ministry of Munitions controls the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia ; the Boards of Agriculture (England, Scotland, and Ireland) control its distribution. The interests of manufacturers, munitions, and agriculture are to some extent opposed. Munitions want the ammonia manufactured and sold freely, so as to avoid the difficulties &apos;if storage. Manufacturers want to clear their stocks rapidly, and for this purpose to be allowed to export at high profits. Agriculture wants ammonia stored during the summer, autumn, and winter for use during the months from January to April 1918. It is the question of storage which is the great difficulty.The output of ammonia for 1917-18 is calculated at about 430,000 tons. Of this ipnintity, munitions take approximately 200,000 tons, leaving 230,000 tons for agriculture,   ft is calculated that we could use 280,000 tons.On the 9th February, 1917, the War Cabinet decided that 200,000 tons of suiphate of ammonia should be made available for agriculture at \bl. 10s. ex works, or 161. per ton delivered, and sanctioned the expenditure of 10s. a ton for railway charge-;, &amp;c.. so as to secure, delivery at the price of 161. in whatever part of the United Kingdom the order was executed.No time limit was fixed, and of the quantity allocated under this decision, about tiO,000 tons will have been used by the end of May.In order to get over the difficulty of storage and to provide for a supply of sulphate of ammonia for agriculture in the months from January to April 1918, when it is used, tho following scheme is suggested :- *1. That exports should be prohibited except in the national interest.2. That a sliding scale of prices for sulphate of ammonia should be so arrangedas to tempt manure mixers, dealers, and farmers to buy in the summer orautumn so as to relieve storage. 3. That the prices should work out over the whole year at 151. 10s. ex works, andmight, for example, be arranged as follows : June to September 1917 : 147. 17s. 6d. per ton. October to December 1917 : 15?.. 7s. 6d. per ton. January to May 1918 : 151. 15s, ,Whatever export was allowed in the national interest should be allowed in the period from June to December 1917.4. That the allowance of 10s. per ton for distribution should be continued by the Government.5. That a Distribution Committee should be set up to provide facilities for distribution, consisting of representatives of the three Agricultural Departments of the United Kingdom and of the sulphate of ammonia trade.In order to secure the sale of stocks which may be held up by manufacturers, the Food Production Department of the. Board of Agriculture should be empowered to apply to the Ministry of Munitions to requisition the sale of ammonia at the prices named.^ J^,/    205
