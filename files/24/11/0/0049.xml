Savoy Hotel,13th April, 1917.London.General Sir William Robertson, iUG*B..H We,r Office.a. w.0. V.0.,Pear Sir William Robertson,My visit to the Western Front has made me realise more fully than ever before certain difficulties in our military position whioh I have been feeling for some time.     I shall now put one of them before you for your consideration, end if you think my ideas worth pursuing I shall be glad to discuss them further with you.a small military force and not as a principal combatant but rather as an auxiliary to France.     This fact was reflected in our general policy which was, of necessity one of great modesty and, as it were, playing secondside with the French Army in defence of French soil and as our forces continued to grow, we proceeded to take over more and more of the French line.     The modesty of our policy and the subordination of our role to that of France have continued notwithstanding the fact that during the last 3 years the whole situation has been transformed end we   re now the principal opponent of the Central Empires and the financial, naval, and, to a large extent, the military mainstay of the Entente.   This anomalous situation is now reflected in three curious respects.1. While our Army is defending the soil of Franceas if it were part of the French Forces, the French have taken the military and diplomatic lead in the Balkans and Greece and are either making mistakes which are seriously embarrassing the success of the War in those parts, or, ifsuccess is achieved, are after the War going to enjoy all theWe entered the War in a very small way withfiddle to France.Our Army took its position side by
prestige in the Balkans which should legitimately have gone to the most powerful and disinterested member of the Entente. 2. , The strategy of our Army on the ?sesternFront has to conform to French direction, although such direction may, from a review of the military situation as a whole, not be a sound one and may pay an undue regard to merely French considerations.     There is also the danger with an unstable Government such as France constantly has that there may be vacillation in this direction and that rivalries between French commanders may impair its efficiency, while we are bound to conform and obey. 3. But the most serious result of all is thatour whole Army (with the exception of the Forcey conducting campaigns elsewhere) has been looked up on the Western Front and we have no great reserve force left for any unforseen contingencies.     For no doubt good and sufficient reasons wo have gradually shouldered more and more of the burden of defending France and so both the French and English Armies have become pinned down along the present Western Front, The Germans must now have great reserve forces which they could fling either against one of the existing fronts or into some new diversion into whioh they may be driven in order to achieve success.If any such diversion is made by the enemy where is our force to meet it ?   If, again, any great diversion planned by us may, at some later stage of the War, present the promise of decisive success, we shall be impotent to execute it because we shall have left no force in our hands to play with.        It is fair that r-ny such reserve force should be found by us and that to the French should be left their legitimate task of defending French soil as far as their power permits.
Various contingencies are possible.     But the one I have most present to my mind is that Holland may, before the end, be drawn into the War on the one side or the other. Holland has plenty of food and rather than starve, the Germans will invade it, and if they do so rapidly they may reach the Dutch seaboard and become possessed not only of much additional supplies but also important naval and submarine bases.     We would have nothing in hand with which to meet such a heavy blow.   I should not think that the fear of the Dutch Army or the Dutch Artillery, with the details of which the enemy is perfectly acquainted, willform a serious deterrent to any such plans.   On the other hand, it is conceivable that to anticipate such a move by Germany or for some other reason we may find it necessary (perhaps with connivance of the Dutch) to carry the War into Dutch territory in order to secure victory. But, again, we shall have no force with which to execute our plans.    It seems to me in every way necessary that we shall begin to think how best we can extricate ourselves partially from the Western Front and release from it a reserve Army for contingencies such as the invasion of Holland or any similar move by the enemy or by us.     Eow could this be dene after^we have become so deeply committed on that front ?I would submit the following suggestion for consideration.    I understand the plan of the presentoperations on the Western front is that while we are pressing the enemy back beyond the Hindenburg line the French are to launch a great attack both south of St Cluentin and further down the line to beyond Rheims, and that their attack will proceed north eastwards with a. view tosecuring the important railway centre at Mezieres. Should this attack succeed, the German railway communications in this sector south of the Ardennes will be cut and their
lines further north through Belgium   ill become of much more importance to them.     At this stage the French should, take back more of our line In this sector and our Army should concentrate towards the north to the Belgian front and as far south as the Lille Roubaix Turcoing sector. This concentration will, I imagine, enable us not only to undertake the necessary operations for securing the Belgian coast as far as the Butch frontier, and to deprive the enemy of his submarine and destroyer bases at Ostend and Leebrugge, but will &apos;;l30 place us in a position to put a very large force into a reserve army to be used only for some such contingency as the one already referred to.It may be possible to secure the release of a reserve army in some other way.   But it is cleor to me that it is not safe to Continue as at present, especially in view of the admitted fact that the enemy has mobilised very large reserve forces.     And unless the formation of a reserve force is clearly arrived -t and definitely worked for, it will not be achieved.On the first two points (the French lead In the Balkans end on the Western Front) I do not wish to say anything in this note.   I feel very strongly that there are very grave dangers ahead of us in our present policy of military, and to some extent diplomatic, subordination to a Government which is neither stable nor far-sighted, but that subject is a very difficult one and could be raised separately.Yours sincerely, (Signed)       J. 3. 3MUIS.
