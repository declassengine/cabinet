COPY.WAR CABINET.Hotel de Grillon, PARIS.Thursday,  26th April,  1917My dear Robertson,I have seen M. Ribot and also M. Painleve.    The former authorised me to tell you that there is no intention on the part of the French Government to stop the offensive.I saw M. Eibot alone and he told me that he thought the moment was not at all suitable for making a change in the higher command.    So I presume that General Nivelle will remain on.Painleve on the other hand struck me as anxious to put Pfeltain into Nivelle&apos;s place.Which of the two (Ribot or Painleve) will win the day it is impossible to say at this moment.I found Painleve much excited and had almost made himself believe that the French had been defeated on the Aisne; Ribot was quite calm.   Both seemed greatly relieved by the confident feelings which I expressed,  and the facts as to the enemy&apos;s condition which I put before them.Yours very truly,(Sd)    D. HAIG.E C R E T . .T. 580.Personal.
SJE C R E T.OPERATIONS .Prom:-   F. M. C-in C, France To;-       C.I.G.S.April 27th,  1917.O.A.D. 418. 8.35 p.m.      27th.I have little to add to what I have reported in ray O.A.D. 414 of 25th my two cipher telegrams sent from Paris on 26th and 27th and my letter sent - you hy King&apos;s Messenger to-day.    Owing to the heavy French casualties, which are estimated at over 120,000 and to disappointment at result actually achieved from French offensive after&quot;the high hopes which General Nivelle had raised,  the French Govern-ment and people are rather despondent,  and as you know there is a tendency to remove hiin.    Such action might have entailed a modification of plans.   As I have already reported to you,  I have the authority of the French Prime Minister to inform you that the offensive -will not he stopped nor will the plans he altered. Besides being informed of this fact I was asked some technical questions as to my tactical methods and ideas.
