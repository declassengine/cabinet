THE SUBMARINE MENACE AND FOOD SUPPLY.It is necessary to call the very serious attention of the War Cabinet to the increasingly heavy losses of our merchant ships by mine and submarine attack. It appears quite evident that the situation calls for immediate action and the adoption of such measures as are possible both to minimise further los-ses and to ensure such rapidity of construction as will enable us to replace the ships lost with sufficient tonnage to allow of a continuance of the war.The serious nature of the position is best shewn by the following figures:-Losses between the 1st and the 18th. Aprilinclusive&quot;Submarines. Mines. Total.No.     Gross Tons.47      90,38958      99,499 --TOTAL     169   406,897        6    12,364     175    418,261Comment is unnecessary in the face of comparison with figures for former months.An even more serious feature of the case is the exceeding-ly heavy losses that have been reported during the last few days;   e,g.-For the 24 hours ending noon, 20th..April, 9 British ships,of5 /y jr /No.    Gross no. GrossTons. Tons.BRITISH           65   218,094 5 11,269ALLIED             47    90,399 - .   -NEUTRAL            57    98,404 1 1,095
of a total of 27,074 tons, were reported sunk, and in addition 3 others were damaged but are being towed into port.For the 24 hours ending noon, 21st, April, 9 British ships, of a total of 29,705 tons, were reported sunk.It is true that some of the vessels mentioned in these two latter statements were sunk on the 18th. April and are therefore included in the total for the period from the 1st. to the 18th. April, but the point to which I wish particularly to direct atten-tion is that reports of so large a number of vessels being sunk have come to hand in two successive periods of 24 hours.    It is obvious that the continuance of such a rate of loss for even a few days will produce the most serious results.The only immediate remedy that.is possible is the provision of as many Destroyers and other patrol vessels as can be pro-vided by the United States of America, and Admiral De Chair has been directed to represent to the United States authorities the urgency of the matter;  also Rear-Admiral Sims, of the United States Wavy, has, at my request, sent a telegram couched in strong terms pointing out the gravity of the situation.Until means can be found and provided for a more extended attack on submerged enemy submarines, the only palliative con-sists in the provision of a sufficient number of small craft to keep them submerged and so &quot;cramp their activities-.The various methods for attacking submerged submarines in the open sea are by bombs dropped from aircraft, by depth charges dropped from patrol vessels, by paravane attack, and by heavy shell in the nature of depth charges fired by patrol ves-sels.    The three former weapons are already in use to the full extent of our resources.    Every possible effort is being made to manufacture and supply howitzers throwing heavy shell to explode under water, but our efforts have been much interfered with by the labour strikes, with the result that the supply ofthese
these weapons so urgently needed is greatly delayed.The measures which were to a certain extent successful against enemy submarines when surface attacks were common, and ?/hich comprised defensive armament of merchant ships, the em-ployment of decoy ships, the provision of smoke making appara-tus, have all diminished very much in value since the sub-merged attack by the submarine became common.The obvious remedy of endeavouring to prevent the egress of submarines from their bases by the use of mines has been carried^to the fullest extent compatible with our supply of mines.    Mines are laid in German waters as fast as they are produced by the manufacturer, but I have reasons to fear that our present pattern of mine is not satisfactory against sub-marines;   otherwise, it is hardly credible that, with the large number that have been laid in the last four months, the losses iri submarines would not have been very heavy.    The new type of mine, which will undoubtedly be satisfactory against submarines, is only in the early stages of manufacture and no considerable deliveries wili take place before July.There is a period, therefore, until July during which we are bound to face most serious losses, and the proper course of action appears to me to be to build up,- whilst we still posses the shipping necessary for the purpose,- such a reserve of food in this country as will enable the population to be fed when the time arrives - as it surely will - when our ship-ping will be at a very low ebb, and we shall not have bene-fited by the use of the German ships now interned in America or by new tonnage which&apos;may be produced by America or by this country.There is one further and most important matter to be considered, and that is our supplies for next year.    There are two separate and distinct policies in regard to shipbuild-ing which we might adopt.    The first is to build a very largenumber
number of small merchant ships, which would be more immune from submerged attack than larger vessels owing to the small target they present and to the dispersion due to their large numbers; . and, secondly, the provision of a few of the largest ships that can be designed.    Ships of the latter type could be made prac-tically unsinkable and, being few in number, we could afford sufficient destroyers to escort them through dangerous waters and so render them safe against submarine or mine attack.The Admiralty have proposed both these alternatives. Neither has been adopted, but instead a type of vessel midway between the two alternatives;   a vessel which is by her size vulnerable to attack and is yet so small that large numbers are required making the provision of escort impossible.I am certain that it is essential for the security of the country that some vessels of the largest type shouM be imme-diately constructed, and that they should be given priority over everything else:   if this were done I believe that they would be running by the Summer of 1918.All considerations as to whether they will be paying eon-eerns commercially should be swept aside ruthlessly in view of the danger facing us that all the sacrifices which the country has made may be negatived by the menace of starvation.22nd, April, 1917.
