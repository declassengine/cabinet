0.1/95/276.SECRET.G.T.  599 WAR CABINET.Secretary,War Cabinet.Nbs:    5 to 10 I enclose 6.copies of a Paper regardingOperations on the Western Front.     The Prime Ministertold me this morning it would come up for discussionto-morrow.     I have sent copies direct to :-The Prime Minister, Lord Curzon, Lord Milner, and Admiral Jellicoein order to save time.(Signed)     P. Maurice,D.M.O.for   CI.G.S.453War Office.30th April, 1917.
- 4:54SECRETO.I/95/276. -G.T.  599 WAR CABINET.OPERATIONS ON WEST FRONT.The French Government is apparently unwilling to continue serious offensive operations.     This, if true, means a drastic change in the military situation. Local offensive operations, which the French are said to he contemplating, will have no real effect.     In war there is no half-way house &quot;between fighting a hattie through with the determination to beat the enemy, and acting defensively.      Such phrases as &quot;active defensive&quot; and &quot;offensive defensive&quot; are mere words without&apos;any meaning in practice.If the French stop now and once get away from the idea of heavy fighting and heavy losses, it will he difficult, if not impossible to persuade them to under-take a big offensive again.      At the best the stop may mean that they will not begin again till the Spring of 1918&apos;, as, until the arrival of an American Army in France,  there is no reason to suppose that the Allies will be in a better position to fight on the Western Front than they are now.
- 2 -455The advantages which the French may claim for inaction are :-    Germany may he starved out (which we certainly cannot rely upon, especially as she already has Roumania to draw upon and may later have Russia);    loss of life will he less and therefore the policy of less fighting will be popular in France (this being the most futile of all arguments);   America may help with troops.     But is it certain that shipping can be found in nine to twelve month&apos;s time for the transport of,  say,  500,000 Americans to France and maintain them there?      Is it certain that our own shipping will hold out for another year, and that the French and British peoples will stand the strain of a year of inactivity while they have to endure continually increasing privations?Can we be sure of &quot;keeping Russia and Italy in the war if Germany is free to strike hard at them?     At the present time Russia is an easy prey, and cannot stand up to a formidable attack.     What will be the attitude of the new Russian Government to us if we allow their country to be over-run once more?     The Italian danger is notorious and nothing more need be said about it.The above are briefly the dangers of inaction.    What are the advantages of continuing the battle?In every great battle a time of extreme stress arrives and the side which sets itSoteeth the hardest usually wins.IAgain, before any considerable success can be gained in battle the enemy&apos;s reserves have to be exhausted.    This used to be a matter of hours., now it is a matter of weeks and months.     The Commander with the last reserves usually wins. I
56When General Eivelle&apos;s plan was presented to the War Cabinet I said I did not believe in an early break through such as he anticipated.      I never had believed in a break through such as he anticipated.      I never have believed in a break through of that kind, nor is an absolute break through necessarily a preliminary to satisfactory terms of peace.     If we sufficiently exhaust the enemy&apos;s reserves we may hope to attain such a measure of success as will persuade him that worse things are in store for him and that it is useless to continue the struggle.6. In the present battle we have done more than weexpected (e.g. captured about 2.50 guns), and if the French have not done what they expected it is chiefly because . their hopes were foolishly extravagant.     They have not gained much ground, but between us we have made a much bigger hole in the German reserves than we thought was possible in the time..     Out of 49 Divisions originally available 20 have been drawn into the fight on the French front and 16 on ours.     The fighting, though undoubtedly very heavy, is going slowly and steadily in our favour, and if the enemy were pushing us back every day and had already taken over 40,000 prisoners and 400 guns I think we should not be without anxiety.     Nor is he, as is shewn by information received from Germany and the tone of recent German communiques.     For the first time in the war Germany is faced with really serious labour troubles at home.     General Groener&apos;s proclamation (Sir W. Townley&apos;s telegram of April27) is clear evidence of this.     Germany&apos;s
457plan is quite obviously to act defensively in the West and hold us up until her submarine campaign has had time to take effect.      She is hopeful that this will happen before next harvest for in the interval between this and then the privations of her people will be severe.      If we- can add anxiety regarding the military situation to anxiety as to food, we may bring her to terms.     We are making her fight against her wishes, and that of itself justifies continued prosecution of the offensive.On the other hand,  if we, by our inaction,  leave her free to win easy successes on fronts other than the western, and allow her to proclaim to the world that we have failed, she will certainly keep both her people and her Allies together, and with these advantages and a harvest,  the yield of which will be increased by the Roumanian crops,  she will,  in 19l8, be in a military position which will allow her to regard calmly the arrival of a dozen or so American Divisions on Lhe Western Front,  even if shipping is available to send and maintain them.My opinion is that the risks of waiting are too great, and that we must bring every possible pressure to bear on the French to make them fight.        General Smuts in a paper just circulated to the War Cabinet supports this view.     He says,  speaking of the Western front,    &quot;It is essential to our ends that we should keep the initiative and offensive, but both are enormously difficult in the situation in which we are placed on this front.     x      x      x      x      x      These impressions which I brought from the front have since been reinforced by the rumour that several important members of the French Government rfo not approve of General Nivelle&apos;s present offensive, and
consider a defensive policy the wisest one for the French Army to pursue.     If this policy is carried out and is applied also to the British Army, it means that towards the end of the third year of. war the enemy has still succeeded in reducing us to the defensive.       This, coupled with the fact that the enemy forces are now more numerous than ever before, that they have conquered large parts of Entente territory, which they are still holding, and that the submarine campaign, already so grave, is growing in violence, would look very much like our defeat, would dishearten all the Entente nations, whose discourage raent might precipitate serious peace movements among one or more of them.     And once the rot sets in,  it might be difficult to stop it.     No doubt, the weight, of America would be felt in 1918, but the danger is that we may not get there unless active operations are prosecuted, and a continuance of military success buoys up the spirit of the nations to fight on till America   ean come in as a decisive factor&quot;.If it should prove that we cannot&apos;persuade the French to fight, or if they agree to fight but we are hot adequately satisfied that they really mean to do so and to the full extent of their power, we should as a pis-aller insist on the taking over a large, part of our front and should continue oust preparation for attacking in Belgium.      I am by no means prepared to recommend now that that operation should be carried out if the French do nothing and if as many German troops are on the Western front as are:, there now, as I doubt if it would be feasible in these circumstances.     But it is very important that it should be undertaken if reasonably practicable, and as the
453(sgd) W.R. ROBERTSON,enemy may give us a chance we should he ready to take advantage of it.     When all is said and done there is really no satisfactory alternative to continuing the battle we and the French have started.I have for a long time past urged on the War Cabine the necessity of our taking much greater control over the war, for I have always felt that a time would come when the French Government would break down.     They have broken down and the only remedy is for us to take charge and at once. I attach a note by Lieut-General Wilson which supports this view.
