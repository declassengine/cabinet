3,153/12. AIR BOARD,Report to the Cabinet.21st April, 1917.al    I. The Air Board have had under consideration duringthis week the programme of aircraft construction for the remainder of the current year8     This has to be evolved in the light, firotly, of the requirements of the two Services for various types of machines;   secondly, of the prospective output of aero-engines already in course of manufacture or provided for;   thirdly, of the capacity of output of the aeroplane manu-facturers of the Country.     The problem of obtaining the results best suited to the needs of the Royal ilaval Air Service and the Royal Plying Corps is accordingly a complex one.     A definiteA-. * * - * A-&apos;-- *&apos; &apos;- -programme has, however, been arrived at which only awaits a final revision, after which a report will bo made tc the Cabinet.II. In consecuencp of the demand for aircraft capable of maintaining their performance when flying at great altitudes, the Board have taken steps to press forward the development of aero-engines equipped with what is known, as a Supercharger. This is a device designed to increase the total volume of the explosive charge in the cylinders of the engine automatically as the altitude increases.     It is most desirable that we should not be anticipated by the enemyvs aerial forces in this directnon.III. At tho request of the Chairman of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Territorial Gha-nges, the Board have reported to the Committee on the subject of the acquisitions of territory which would be desirable from the point of view of aerial communication between different parts
of the V/orlcUIV. The- Beard have approved of steps being taken to create a special factory to be operated by a private firm, such as the British Aluminium Company, for the development45f a suitable light alloy for aircraft construction.   Duralumin has been given up in the construction of aeroplanes -because of a tendency to rot, believed to be due to the he at,.-treatment to which it is subjected in course of manufacture and which has to be carried out within a narrow margin of temperature.   If a satisfactory alloy can be discovered, it would certainly be of use for aeroplanes.     The National Physical Laboratory has been at work on the problem and considerable progress in the matter has been made.V. The delivories of engines and aeroplanes have been as follows:-Engines.   Aeroplanes.Total for week ending 14thApril..................... 1 0 138* .....Total for March, 1917........ 835 716*Total for March. 1916........ 245&apos;. 219Note;(1) The week to 14th April included Easter Monday, and cannot be considered as a normal working week.(2) The deliveries for March, 1916, did not includeany Admiralty figures..In addition to tho above 7 seaplanes were delivered in the week ending 7th April, 1917.(Signed)     H. P. HARVEY,Secretary to the Air Board.
