I understand that the War Cabinet aro in some doubt as to the expediency of making a Compulsory Order as recommended by the Board of Trade Interdepartmental Committee on tho Feeding and Utilisation of Horses limit-ing the grain allowed for consumption by pleasure horses.I therefore circulate a note prepared by the Chairman of the Committee dealing more particularly with the question of race horses.A rough provisional estimate has been prepared of the saving that would result from the adoption of the Committee^ recommendations,   (it must be understood that this ostimate is somewhat conjectural, since tho results of tho Census of Horses now being taken cannot be definitely known for several weeks).   It shows that a saving of about 50,000 tons per month or 250,000 tons during the five summer months may be expected from the adoption of the Committee^ recommendations.In view of the extreme importance of oconasasing Cereals with a view to saving tonnage I strongly urge that authority be given forthwith to put in force the Committeefs recommendation, viz. that no grain be fed to pleasure horses botween the beginning of May and the end of September.As tho question is very urgent I should be glad of an immediate decision.A.H.S.25th April, 1917.
GRAIN  KK  H0RS1S, H5EMOR4NDUM BY MR, R. H. SELBIE.The sorious shortage of all kinds of grain that at present prevails and the roal danger that our supplies will prove in-sufficient io last until the next harvest? make it a matter of extreme urgency to secure that as large a proportion of tho grain that exists shall he available for human or other ossential consumption.    Inasmuch as it is estimated that the average amount of grain consumed hy one horso is sufficient to provide the flour ration for twentyono persons,&quot; tho importance of se-curing immediate economies in consumption hy horses is manifest and is such as must necossarily override many considerations which would have force in normal times.It is generally agreed that tho employment of pleasure horsos such as carriage and riding horses, hunters and polo ponies should he susponded for the time being and that they should oithor ho turned over to tho Army or put out to grass until October.   A difference of opinion? however, exists as to the treatment of race horses and thoroughbreds *   The matter has beon diocussod by tho Committee on the Utilisation and Feeding of Horses, and T&amp;ile there is a strong feeling- in favour of the complete cessation of racing in view of the seriousness of the grain situation it is considered that the views of the Jockey Club 3hould ee^gain ascertained before any definite order is made.The enquiries I have been able to make lead me to the con-elusion thet there are no sufficient reasons based on grounds of National necessity for tho continuance of even tho limited number of race meetings now allowed.   The principal objections to them from the point of view of my Committee are: -(l)    That it is exceedingly difficult to get other horseowners: especially those engaged in business, to appreciate tho necessity for economising in.the use of horsos and horse feed while large racing studs are maintained and the horses handsomely fed.   Thia point was brought out with
special prominence in the recent negotiations with the firms engaged in delivery work; (2)    That the meetings inevitably load to extra travel both by rail and motor car and the use of petrol which might otherwise bo employed for business purposes and effect the release of horses.It is contended by supporters of racing that its con-tinuance is necessary for the preservation of the bloodstock industry? which is of importance not only commercially but also for tho provision of Cavalry horses for tho Army.   It is not suggested that if all &quot;race-horses were turned to grass during the present Summer the individual horses would suffer any permanent deterioration;0 but it is argued that the breeding industry would bo prejudicod in two ways, (l) by tho suspension of tho process of selection of tho fcest horses for breeding which racing provides; (2) by the fact that the brooding of thbtoigftbred-g would coase for the time being to be profitable and that consequently many owners would give up their studs.It is pointed out that considerable restrictions have already been placed upon racing and that   any further restrio-tions would have serious consequences in the two ways indicated.As regards the first of the above arguments, the suspen-sion of the selective process for one yoar, or two^ could hardly have very serious results? but if it is regarded as of National importance that the selective process should continue some means might be devised for carrying it on less open to objection than tho holding of public race meetings.   The amount of racing that still continues is perhaps insufficiently realisod on account of the fact that racing in Groat Britain has been greatly curtailed4; but in Ireland tho situation is different.    It is assorted that more meetings are hold therethan before the war and that English owners are. sending horses I&apos; Eovor to Ireland to run. Ie I
As regards tho second argument? it may he pointed oul that other &quot;businesses have had to suffer in the present crisis and that if it. should he found after the war that the suspension of racing has so affected the breeding industry as to imperil the futuro supply of Cavalry horsos steps might then be taken by an extension of the &quot;premium&quot; system or in other ways to encourage the industry.If any compromise on tho question generally^ is con-sidored politic it migjit bo on the following lines&apos;; viz*-that all brood marcs, of vfeich there are about 6^000, should bo put to grass for the next five months; that the supply of oats to foals and yearlings (about 5,000) should bo strictly limitod,&quot; that all racing geldings should bo sold to the Army so far as they are suitable or turnod to grass? and that grain in normal quantities should only be supplied to stallions at service (about 900) and to a limited number of young thorough-breds in training to be selected by the Jockoy Club,- the balance of the latter class to be put to grass or sold.B.
