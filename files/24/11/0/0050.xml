THE NATIONAL FOOD POLICY.During the past two years the special War Committees of the Royal Society have prepared Memoranda dealing with various questions arising out of the war and pre-sented/to the Government, Departments concerned. The Committee specially con-cerned with food have dealt with the Food Supply in Germany and the Food Supply in the United Kingdom and with various matters connected with these subjects.When a special Ministry of Food was set up the present Food Committee took the earliest opportunity to urge the need for scientific advice, and to illustrate their contention they showed in a private communication to Lord Devonport how both physiological and economic reasons combined to condemn the suggestion to introduce meatless days, and to prove that maximum prices for milk would result in a diminu-tion of supply. For similar reasons the need for the diversion of cereals from live stock to human food was insisted upon.The public announcements of the Ministry from the first appeared to show a neglect of relevant scientific principles. Elementary and fundamental physiological and economic considerations were ignored, and the Committee, to avoid the charge that a body of experts had remained silent in face of measures which they knew could result only in harm, decided, though with reluctance, to go beyond questions of a technical character and to address themselves to broad policy. Memoranda were prepared and copies sent to the Ministry of Food and to other Government Depart-ments. So far as the Ministry of Food is concerned, they appear to have failed in their object. The Committee are forced to this conclusion by their observation of the policy adopted, which appears to be concentrated on hasty attempts to reduce consumption imperfectly co-ordinated with measures for extending the bread supply; and to be applied almost exclusively to the comparatively small number of the wrell-to-do, rather than to the millions of workers for whom bread is the main source of working power.Under these circumstances the Committee feel that it is their duty to make an emphatic protest against those parts of the Food Controllers policy which, in their opinion, are paving the way for disaster.The main point at issue is that the Food Controller, in framing his policy, has ignored the fundamental fact that the efficiency of the manual worker depends as directly upon his supply of food as does the mileage of a motor car upon its petrol. The Food Controller^ policy has laid excessive emphasis on decrease of consumption. As to this two remarks must be made. First, that though there is undoubted scope for the avoidance of waste, a certain level of consumption is necessary for efficiency. Secondly, that by applying his policy indiscriminately to meat and bread, his measures have indeed decreased the consumption of home-grown meat, but have increased the drain upon the nation&apos;s supply of bread, which has to be imported, and is the first and most vital of its resources. The delay in diverting the supplies of barley and other cereals from any purpose other than the making of bread a measure which the Committee urged as far back as December of last year has contributed in no slight degree to bringing about the present critical position.The Committee view with apprehension the recent order fixing the price of home-grown grain. They are not, indeed, on principle opposed to the policy of maximum prices under all circumstances. Although the world&apos;s experience of maximum prices has, up to the present, been extremely discouraging, the Committee recognise that the possibility of successfully carrying out a maximum price policy I depends largely on the contemporary organisation of production and distribution; so that, under modern conditions, measures of price restriction may, in particular instances, have larger prospects of success than in previous periods. But they are impressed with the necessity in fixing prices, of taking the best available expert advice as to the reactions that are likely to follow.   It is not a(4140)
question simply of dissatisfaction on the part of the producers leading to a with-drawal of supplies from the market; for that withdrawal may be only temporary. Nor is the argument that dissatisfaction may cause a future decrease of production necessarily conclusive, since the prices fixed may still be sufficiently remunerative in themselves. The consideration most pertinent to the recent Grain Prices Order is this-that if alternative uses for his grain remain open to the farmer which are more remunerative, as for the feeding of cattle, he is sure to take advantage of them, and that no prohibition is likely to be effective in preventing this withdrawal of food from direct human use. The experience of Germany is very significant in this respect. A want of adjustment between grain and cattle prices is now generally recognised in that country to have been one of the main causes of the ill success of the governments food policy. The detailed argument to that effect of Professor Eltzbacher is accessible in the Food Supplement to the Daily Review of the Foreign Press, issued by the General Staff of the War Office, March 5, 1917. An account of a Report on the same lines by experts from all the chief German Agricultural Colleges, of the subsequent decision of the Advisory Committee of the German Food Ministry, and of the Orders of the Federal Council of March 19, readjusting, in consequence, the whole of the maximum food prices, will be found in the Daily Notes of the War Trade Intelligence Department, Nos. 548, 567,.577.The Committee cannot but feel some doubt as to whether adequate attention was given to this German experience before the recent orders -were issued. The ill effect of maladjustment of prices in Britain will, indeed, be less serious than in Germany, since this country is far less dependent on home-grown grain; and should a mistake have been made, it can be quickly retrieved. Even so, however, such mistakes would be regrettable;. and they are the more alarming if they are the out-come of a persistent tendency to look at the one aspect only of the problem, and to disregard well-informed opinion on other and equally important aspects. The events that have already followed the fixing of prices for potatoes, milk, and corn would seem to indicate that this country is repeating the mistakes of the Germans  mistakes the effects of which they are now laboriously endeavouring to undo.The Committee recognise that while enhanced prices are an incentive to increased production and decreased consumption, such prices fall oppressively on the poorer sections of the community. The State, however, can most economically step in by organising the preparation and distribution of the necessary articles of diet for this part of the population, the State bearing part of the cost.A study of the recent publications of the Ministry of Food reveals many inconsistencies. The &quot; Hotels Order,&quot;, for instance, institutes a meatless day, which can be interpreted only to mean that the Food Controller considers it necessary to curtail the consumption of meat, though this must be at the expense of other foods, the stocks of which are limited. Yet the &quot; Food Economy Campaign Handbook,&apos;&apos; issued from the Ministry almost on the same day as the &quot; Hotels Order,&quot; enjoins the well-to-do to eat less bread and more meat.This handbook contains many statements which are so misleading as to be dangerous. The statement that &quot; If you are eating meat you are better without bread; starch and meat together double the stomach&apos;s work &quot; is untrue, but is not quite so dangerous as the next sentence : &quot; Eat more vegetables and fruit instead.&quot; Even if the serious results which might follow to anyone attempting to replace the food value of bread by fruit and vegetables be ignored, the fact remains that the supply of both is wholly inadequate for such general substitution.The assertion that &quot; before the war the nation could have Jived on the food it wasted&quot; is wholly at variance with the facts; these were set out fully in the Com-mittee&apos;s &quot;Report on the Food Supply of the United Kingdom&quot; (Dec. 9, 1916, Cd. 8421). No less at variance with truth is the statement that &quot; half-chewed food gives half its nourishment ... eat slowly, you will eat half as much as you eat now, grow healthier and stronger on it, double vour power of work.&quot;Statements of this kind can only discredit&apos;the whole policy of the Ministry of Food. It may be said that these injunctions are to be taken rhetorically and are meant only to impress the general public with the urgency of the situation. They are likely to have the opposite effect. The public is quick to detect inconsistencies and blunders of this magnitude, and will take them as excuse for the non-observance of the very necessary policy of individual economy preached by the Food Controller. When the Ministry makes statements which the man in the street can easily ascertain to be false it courts disbelief in* its graver pronouncements.
