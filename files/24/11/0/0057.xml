Appendix &apos;I&apos; to Report of Conference on&apos;-Tactical Employment-of Tanks, held at War-Qff-iee^ Londpn, on .4th March,&apos; 1917.&apos;&apos;---- . -   General Headquartersof the Northern andNorth Eastern Armies. To     General migham, 19th April, 1917.-&quot; . rJar Office.,&apos; vThe report of the conference held at the War Office on 4th&apos; Larch last-, contains the following passage :-;,Eritish experience indicates that it is better to allot the tanks to a Corps front,  controlled by the Corps,  than to have a detachment of tanks definitely allocated to       a division and;the plans drawn up by the divisions independently,  as contemplated by General Estienne&quot;.1 did not consider it necessary to ask for a modificatio of this passage, but 1 am anxious in the following remarks,  to explain quite clearly my opinion on this point as it .rea,lly differ very slightly from, that of the British General Staff.Our Tank units are formed in the following manner -A Eleet (Groupement)   consists,  theoretically,  of 5 Groups,  and a supply and repair section (workmen Coy.).A Group (16 tanks)  consists of 4 batteries of 4 tanks.I-efore an engagement,  one or asore Fleets are placed by G.H.Q.. at the disposal of an Army Group Commander; this Commander distributes them among the Army Commanders, who in their turn distribute them among their Army Corps,  all this being carried out in the manner most favourable to the strategic object and the tactical conditions:    each Army Corps Commander distributes the Groups of the Eleet (or fraction of Fleet)  allotted to him, among the divisions of the Army Corps,  according to the conditions cf th ground over which the attack is to be mada etc.The plan cf action for the tank units is not drawn up by the Divisional Commanders independently.    The main lines of the plan are devised by the Army Commander, who distributes the kleets assigns the objectives to be reached by the tank units in co-operation with the infantry etc. and thus secures the general cohesion of the operation;    on this main structure each Army Corps Commander builds up the plan of action for the Army Corps, working as far as the tanks are concerned,- in conjunction with the corresponding Eleet Comrmander.This plan of action is, moreover,  submitted for the approval of the General Commanding the Army.In the course of the action, and for this period only, each Group is under the command of the Divisional &quot;General&apos;in thesector
9 osector in which it is working; but as soon as that Division withdraws, the Group passes under the command of the relieving division (that which follows up successful operations), or else it is withdrawn at the same time as the. Division, by order cf the General Commanding the Army Corps or Army.In order to avoid using the tanks in a manner contrary sound technical principles,  the General Commanding the Assault Artillery keeps in close touch, buth during the preparation for the engagement and in the course of the action, with the Generals Commanding the Army Group and Armies concerned, by ordea of G.H.Q,.    In the same :way the Officer Commanding each Shleet of Tanks should in principle keep in touch, during the engageaer f 1th the Command post of the General Commanding the corresponding Army Corps.1 should be very glad if the above explanation should help to throw some light on the question. -  .Thanking you.Yours etc-Sstienne.
