i 7I -to M THS BOARD OF TRaD*) ON THii wOEKING Oj? .BT8 1SSTRIOTION SOHIME AMD THU KSMTION Of       IRQ IMPORTS TO SHIPPING. x 0 0jo the President of the Board of Trade.oir,On April 4th I submitted a report covering a preliminary report &quot;by Professor Oliapman on the working of the Restriction of Imports Scheme and the  relation of imports to Shipping.   A further report carrying the information to a later date has now been received from him.The following brief summary of the salient facts is based on this Report. (1) Loss and Gain of British Shipping.In tho fortnight April 1-15 the gross loss of British ships of over tons was 133,000 tons ialmost exactlythe average rate for the previous throe months).   Tho gain by building etc. was 76,000 tons (which is well above tho three months&apos; average) tho net loss being 57,000 tons compared with a fortnightly average net loss of 78,000 tons for the last three months.If oilers and ships below . 1,600 tons b;e included the figures for the first fortnight of April shew a net loss of 52,000 tons, (tho balance between a gross loss of 159,000 and a gain of 107,000 tons.) W Reduction in Shigping entering^our port3.In trances of British ships with cargoes have continued to koep up wonderfully, the decline in tho first ten days of April compared with April 1916 being negligible - only 8,000 tons or lifc. * (Tiiis is a good deal better than in harch when the percentage decline was 14).   Entrances of foreign vessels, however, shewed a falling off 56.1 per cent compared with 1916, as against a fall of 64.6 per cent in riarch.   Taking iiritish and Foreign ships together the decline in entrances with cargo was about one fifth (I9.6)b) in the first ten days of April
compared with nearly one-third (31 per cent) in March and one-eighth (12.7 per. cent) in February),   The recovery though so far not very great is appreciable.It may be noted that the decline in foreign tonnage is almost entirely in neutral ships,-the entrances of allied ships being practically the same as in 1916. ) ffpfofltfon, of Imports.Turning&apos; from shipping to cargoes, the figures for imports can now be given up to the end of -larch i.e. a month later than in the previous report.The March imports shewed a decline in weight of over a million tons compared with March 1916 - nearly three times as great a foiling off as in February. (4) Incidence of the reduction on restricted and unrestricted imports.Of the total decline 4 7,000 tons affected restricted imports. This compares not infsvourably with the forecast of saving in the report of the Import Restrictions Committee, (which contemplated an ultimate saving of 500,000 tons a month only to be reached towards tho end of 1917)   The total weight of restricted imports imported in i&apos;larch was only 308,000 tons shewing that on the average they have been already reduced by nearly&apos;60 per cent.   On the other hand unrestricted imports, the maintenance of which is presumably essential, wore reduced in March through tonnage shortage by 645,000 tons or 23 per cent.   This reduction is analysed in para-graph (5).   Had there been ho conscious selection of imports so that the tonnage shortage operated equally on all classes of cargoes, the reduction of restricted imports would have been only half what it actually was (220,000 tons), while than of essential imports would have been correspondingly increased.
Ee duct ion of. pertain restricted imports.By far the greatest reduction in Larch are shewn by wood and timber (251,000 tons), paper and paper making materials (32,000 tons) and fruit (45,000 tons.)    These three items account for 370,000 tons reduction out of the total of 427,000 tons.Beduction cf Imports of certain essential unrestricted com?-edit ies.The distribution of the decline in unrestricted imports among,various classes of commodities is shown ibelow:-Wheat and Flour........Other Grain &amp; Flour.......Other Food (unrestricted).Iron Ore..................Cotton....................Other Raw Materials (unrestricted)...........Imports in 1917  I  Decline comparedI       with 1915.Manufactured Good, (unrestricted)...March 000 tons 395 262 259 495 53531152 &quot;z^SZ&quot;&quot;Jan-Men 000 tend 1,274 756 943 1,51 2391,630490March  I Jan-Mch000tens 114  j 93  I135  !i75  I66 115  ! 147000 tens99 365 141 9 73573316,850 j    645 ! 1,125The position and outlook as regards Timber.It seems clear that the pitwood situation is developing more favourably than the Imports Restriction Committee antici-pated and that we may expect to effect a much greater tonnage saving under this head, though, owing to the short voyages the tonnage released will not bring us an equal tonnage of essen-tial supplies.On the other hand the sawn-timber position,.(which from the tonnage point of view is the more important) remains pre--carious,. as the   carrying out of the full programme of saving depends on economies of consumption (which are only slowly\ \
coming into operation) and the provision, of an adequate supply of labour (including skilled lumbermen) as well as machinery and transport.    The two latter difficulties seem capable of solution.    The position of labour appears to be much the most sorious difficulty of the situation,.:;:and unless such labour can bo made available the drain on stocks may become dangerous and the Director of Timber Supplies fears a timber famine in August.    The Director expects to have 9,000 men at work by the end of May aid he estimates his future requirements at 3-4,000 men a month from that time onwards.      It is of the highest importance from the point of viow of imports and tonnage that he should be able to obtain his requirements.The reduction of timber imports by increasing home supplies is by far the most fruitful method available for further curtailing imports.    We calculate that for every 10,000 men employed in increasing supplies of sawn timber at least half a million tons of imports can be saved per annum.H. MliB SMITH. 4. 17
