x SEC R E T, IW ^* 5 B J&amp;JI CoPy ff0*bVlo/96/277OPERAT iCITS II, PALEg? &apos;le On; the ,29th December. 1918,  I submitted a note to the WarCabinet on .a proposal to undertake a campaign in Palestine, this note I gave it as my opinion that an offensive in could not be undertaken until the Autumn of 1917. but &amp;aat there was a.good prospect of cur-being able tc build up a in Egypt during the Summer by&apos;transferring troops from East Africa. Mesopotamia and India-,  so as to enable an advance on Jerusalem to be begun in. the Autumne     This policy was approved by the War Cabinet,  and Sir A*Murray was instructed on the 11th January that his mission should be primarily defensive, but that he should by, as aggresive as circumstances would allow, and should prepare for an Autumn campaign in Palestine,2. On the 22nd February I submitted a further note givingin more detail my proposals for an invas3.cn of Palestine, and describing the measures taken for providing Sir AoMurray with the necessary re inf ore omen t s.    In this paper I stated that it was then too early to come to a definite decision as much depended on the results of the Allied operations in the main theatres,  on our operations in Mesopotamia and on what the Russians would be able to achieve against the Turks*&amp;/ During February and March, sir Adfurray successfully clearedthe Sinai Peninsula,  occupied Rafa,  and advanced to the neighbourhood of Gaza, while the Arabs began to operate energetically against the Turkish force in the HedlazA    In Mesopotamia the Turks were decisively &quot;defeated and Baghdad was occupied,  the Russian forces in Persia were making satisfactory progress, and I was assured by the Grand Duke Nicholas of his determination to take the offensive in force in the direction of Mosul as soon as climatic conditions would permit..iurpnerC ^
2.Further, the reinforcement of our forces in Egypt during the summer by 13 British battalions from East Africa and India and by 4 Indian battalions was assured, and we hoped to send about one division from Mesopotamia.     I therefore proposed to the War Cabinet on 30th ultimo that Sir A, Murray should be instruct-ed to develop his, successes to the full and to adopt a more offensive role, Tho War Cabinet having approved thisproposal, instructions were sent to Sir A* Murray that his immediato objective should be the defeat of /the enemyrs forces south of Jerusalem and the occupation of that town.Since these instructions were despatched, however, General Aioxieff has definitely informed me that owing to transport and supply difficulties, of which he has only just become aware, he can hold out no prospect of offensive action on the part of the Caucasus Armies, and none in Mesopotamia unless we can supply his troops.      Wo are endeavouring to do what we can in this respect, but the Russian troops in the vicinity of Mesopotamia number only a few thousand men and cannot be expected to give much assistance, and even this will be uncertain.     The result of this is an entire change In the situation, as it will leave the Turks freo to send large reinforcements both to Mesopotamia and Syria, whereas we had hoped that tho Russians v/ould not merely hold the large number of Turks now opposed to thorn in Caucasia., but would deal them heavy and destructive blows.     How many men the Turks can send under the altered conditions will depend upon the number they can supply, and tho extent to which Russian pressure In Caucasia decreases&apos;,   An approximate estimate of what could bo employed against us in circumstances favourable to Turkey Is 200,000 menin
in Mesopotamia and a like number in Syria,     Of the latter number it is thought that not more than 60,000 men could bo maintained south of Jerusalem, owing to defective communica-tions, the balance being between Jerusalem and Aleppo and of course available to make good losses In the troops south of Jerusalem,   As we cannot now hope to transfer any troops from Mesopotamia to Egypt the force in the latter theatre will be correspondingly loss than originally expected,while, as above shewn, the enemy forces may be considerably greater.5, I still think that the superiority of our forces ontho frontier of Palestine over those- of the enemy allows, us to anticipate a considerable measure of success, especially so because of the large mounted force we have, but in view of the situation brought about by the collapse of the Russians, and having regard to the recent failure to take Ga        t is not now justifiable to adhere to the instructions issued to Sir.A.Murray in March to advance at once on Jerusalem,   I consider they should be modified as follows:-&quot; To take every opportunity of defeating the Turkish forces opposed to him, and to folio?/ up with all the moans at his disposal any success gained with the object of driving the Turks from Palestine as and when this becomes practicable&quot;.3* The War Cabinet had under consideration on the 6th inst.the question of the suitability of Sir.A.Murray for the Chief Command of the operations.   They recognised the exceptionally good work done by him in Egypt, but expressed doubts as to whe-ther ho possesses the qualities required to continue tho opera-tlons. They decided to re-examine the question,if necessary,after he had made the second attack on Gaza for which he was then pre-paring.   Ho has made it and it has not succeeded.     We mayexpect
expect much hard fighting, and be prepared, as alway in war, for some set-backs.     It is therefore very necessary that the V.&apos;ar Cabinet should have full confidence in the Commander, not only when he is successful but alse when, sometimes, he is net, fsr n-y Commander can guarantee success on all occasions.W.

Sir Acay.
52017 2.4.1917.prom C. I. Gr. S,Asks if Sir ;.   urray is receiving all no cos-sary re-guircmonts.War.Cabinet have given careful consideration to your A.M.1749 and think owing to distance you may not fully realise tho groat importance of your operations. Everyone now fools the strain of war, and strain is increasing; therefore moral effect of success is of great importance in strengthening hands of the G-overn-ment and making public more ready to bear their bur-dens.     Success in Palestine will have inspiriting effect in Christendom.    War Cabinet are anxious that your operations&apos;should bo pushed with all energy. The situation of the Turks must also bo considered. There is unrest in Constantinople and the Turks are more exhausted, by the war than any of our enemies. Success on your part combined with recent events in Mesopotamia must have great effect.      I do not under-rate fighting capacity of enemy, but after careful consideration of what he can do see no reason why with reinforcements detailed for Egypt you should not be successful if you employ all troops at your disposal. Let me know at once if you are not satisfied as to this. Requisite drafts will receive every attention.   War Cabinet enquira further whether you are getting all you require as regards guns, ammunition, transport, war material.    Rest assured we will do our utmost to meet your d mauds.     Have you definitely decided to lay your lino alonf the coast to Jaffa in preference to linking up with Bcersheba Railway?      If so, report reasons and. give railway proposals.    If you have decided to go to Jaffa, I am informed you will have material to.take you th.. re. *.A, II, 1767,
l7g7. Your 32017,   Hope War Cabinet will be assured that Iappreciate importance of operations.   Work of EgyptianSir [urray.Expeditionary Force affords proof of this.   See my latestplans   despatch.    For last 15 months my sole idea has been torequire- ,      , ,push on railway rapidly in order to invade enemy&apos;sterritory and bring him to battle.    I do not think a single day of the last 18 months has been wasted nor ^thaV &quot; -greater energy could be displayed than at present.   East August I was at Romani.   Wow I am with an army at the gates of Gaza, which represents an advance of 110 miles over desert destitute of food, water, shelter^ roads.    Every man and gun available with the necessary supplies are being pushed to the front, and the railway is strained to its utmost limit.    Preparations are in progress to attack Gaza and should be completed within 16 days. Am anxious not to hurry this operation having induced enemy to collect a considerable force in front of me, and I feel that there is a good chance of achieving considerable success with properly organised attack, I intend after capture of Gaza to invade Palestine as rapidly as railway progress permits.    Railway material at present sufficient only to take me to Dir El Belah. Next consignment only left India yesterday,    I shall be glad if necessary material to reach ilaffa&quot; could fro expedited. Railway will pass along coast to Jaffa and not link up with Beersheba line, so as to keep left flank on sea   &apos; and also on account of following difficulties in linking up with existing Beersheba line.      (1) Break of gauge,    (2)    Narrow gauge would prove inadequate. (3) Linking up standard gauge with Beersheba would involve gradients of over 1 in 100, thus reducing carrying capacity. (4) Laying standard line on present level would be useless.By
tf. 176-7 By keeping close to coast gradients over 1 in 1004,4.17. .        ;   . .-.--;ir A. Murray should be avoided, and carrying capacity maintained, cont.)Railway proposals are to extend sta-ndard gauge railway Gaza towards Jaffa following line of coast. It will probably be essential to double, line from Kantara to Gaza,I have given my best troops to France, Mesopotamia and Salonika.   Although numbers at my disposal are not what I asked for, l realise fully no mere available at present.     If Forces kept up to establishment by reinforcements I hope to conduct a successful campaign, in Palestine, -providing the enemy is not heavily reinforced.    Following deficiencies, however, require to be made up immediately in addition to.oarlier detailed demands.(1)    I require most urgently Mechanical Transport already asked for, as to the despatch of which I have not been notified...(2)    I still consider my A.S.C.drivers insufficient.   Dilution with.- excessive number of native drivers, who in contact with enemy prove unreliable, is necessary.     Proportion of A.S.C. to native drivers should not be less than half and half.    Many animals required for trains and ammunition columns, and none are in sight., Shortage of veterinary officers is serious.(5)   In addition to my requirements for the artillery for two new divisions, I require an additional Siege Battery,  (two 611 Howitzers two 3&apos;&apos; Howitzers) in view of probability of having to attack strongly fortified positions. I am satisfied as to ammunition, provided present scale can be maintained.
(4)     My L. of C. Signal Company has largely extended its sphere and needs increasing urgently, but&apos; I cannot provide all from local resources.(5)      It will assist greatly If outstanding demands for&apos;signal and telegraph material can be met quickly and shipping accelerated. One additional Army Troops Company R.E. is urgently required.(6)     10 aeroplanes newest type are urgently needed to cope with enemy&apos;s Halberstadt machines, I do not wish to create difficulties and wish to overcome any existing, but want you to understand that I and my troops are doing, and will continue to do, out utmost to bring about decisive result,v.If our progress appears slow this is Inevitable. Everyone is stretched to utmost and to call upon them for further effort would discourage and be like spurring a willing horse.   Finally, as pars. 1 and 4 of your telegram above referred to might be read to moan that the &apos;mr Cabinet considered -there had been a lack in the conduct of my opera-tions hitherto, and that I need to be spurred on, I would respectfully request that it may be re-assured on this point.      I feel sure that the members will forgive me if this telegram shows me to be over-sensitive, or if I have read into the wording views which were not intended.No.. 32281

We are consolidating ground gained yesterday and-1917,.making readjustments for further advance*   It is Sir A. v*ray. essential to proeeod deliberately as operations maycover some days and be carried out vrithout relief of troops.    \&apos;e anticipate counter-attack by all 5 of enemy&apos;sotion at* Z A. divisions, the recently arrived 54th inclusive, and hiscavalry division.     Lino held by enemy rests on sea about SHEIKH HASSAN, and runs thence to the A LI LiUNTAR Ridge. This section made up of double line of trenches and redoubts is strongly held infantry and machine guns being concealed in impenetrable cactus hedges.   Due. south of GA-aA is the main ALI LiUNTAR position, the key to whole system of defences covering the town.   This position consists of network of mutually supporting strong works, commands all approaches to the town from south-west, south and south-oast, and it has been strongly fortified and besides obstacles provided by cactus hedges is well wired and made into nest of German manned machine guns.   Thence line turns back norths-east, folio -in;.; eastern slopoo of ALI MUNTAR ridge to FRYER1S HILL 2,000 yards d.ue east of.G .ZA, whence it bonds south-east through KIRBFT EL BIR, KHIRBFT STHAN and ATAVINFH to HARFIRa on which left flank rests.   This section is held in semi-continuous series of redoubts and trenches and commands the 2,000 yards of low ground north-west and south-west of SHFIKH ABBAS ridge, and about the GA!7.,.. - BIR EL SABA road across which our troops must eventually attack.In

His flank south-east of line SHELLAL - HAREIRA is protec-tcd hy belt of &quot;broken waterless country impassable for wheels and in which our mounted troops cannot operate effectively.Casualties up to date approximately 5,000. About 200 prisoners taken by us yestcrdayc   A tank was de-stroyed by 3 direct hits by the enemy&apos;s artillery.R We estimate enemy force opposing you at amaximum of 35,000 fighting men of all combatant arms.

Arish is entrenched camp and Rafa will be prepared similarly.    My intention is to maintain offensive and try and manoeuvre Turks into the open.    It is chiefly a problem of water, especially as summer will dry up small supplies now available. Our horses only water once in 24 hours and then have long distances to go.Your 33178.   Discussed with Chetwode enemy strength.   He7.).m. puts enemy&apos;s infantry at above 30,000 and total strength abovelir   45,000.    Chauvel, who has been operating against SHERIA and fray.BEERSHEBA, puts total much higher; my view is that 40,000 toI Sjth. 45,000 is probably the limit, owing to supply difficulties. Following Turkish Divisions appear to be in front of us: 3rd 16th, 27th, 53rd, 54th with 3rd Cavalry Division.    Prisoner Officer and Sergeant independently reported 7th Division at BEERSHEBA but neither belonged to 7th Division.[ray6. All well.
