APPLIES Off EOOD SENT TO BRITISH &quot;PRISONERS 05&apos; WAR IN GERMANY AITSELSEWHERE.Note by the Secretary of State for rrar.&apos;With reference to War Gabinet 122/ (9) ,  a Meeting was convened by rne on the 20th April to consider the question of the supplies sent to our prisoners-of-war in hostile countries,  the Central Prisoners-of-War Committee and the branches of the War Office concerned-in the matter being represented.The net.amount of food supplies despatched to each prisoner other than officers totals 36 lbs a fortnight, of which 13 lbs are bread.   Of the bread, very little is sent from this country, the bulk being despatched from. Berne and Copenhagen; but, whereas the flour for the Swiss bread is obtained locally,  that for Copenhagen bread, as also the fuel,  oil and lard for its manufacture are sent from this country.    The large amount of bread, which amounts to 15 ozs. a day as against 8 ozs. allowed to the, civilian population in this country, is based on strong representations made &quot;by experts- on the Staff of the late American Embassy in Berlin.The German ration is unquestionably very insufficient, and it is doubtful if, in the form in which it is issued (substitutes being freely used), it will keep a man alive.   But,, -whatever he its value, and- according to many accounts it is not so unpalatable as is often represented,  there is no doubt that our men dislike it and the mode of its preparation., with the result that they live almost entirely on the contents of their parcels, and we, in fact,  send them food in substitution for, and not merely in amplification of,  the rations supplied by Germany.The amount of foodstuffs which may be saved to the German Government by the&apos;rejection of their rations by the majority of our prisoners-of-war is so small as to be practically negligible, and the only reason for any restriction of the amount sent would seem, to be the food shortage in this country.The question has been laid before the Pood Controller who states that he has &quot;given the matter his careful consideration and does not consider it desirable to reduce the quantity supplied for this purpose&quot;.There has hitherto been no limitation to the amount of foodstuffs sent to officer prisoners-of-war, and in certain cases this has been excessive.    Unlike parcels for men those for officers are not packed under supervision and have to be censored. The question of &apos; the restriction of the amount sent to officers to that allowed for men, and the enforcing of regulations as to packing of parcels under supervision was consideredIn favour of the nroposal for restriction :-(a) Tho cause of complaint which is sometimes made as to differentiation of treatment will be removed.(b) The Censorship will be relieved of the duty of censoring the parcels, which, in fact-, it has &quot;never been possible to carry out fully.        &apos; :    &apos; .As
As opposed, to it :-(a) Officers have to. buy food which is little if at all better than that supplied to the men, and the amount they can purchase is extremely limited.(b) Owing to long confinement and lack of employment a number of them are in&quot;a low state of health and require delicacies, which probably cannot be sent in place of solid food stuffs for which there is actual necessity owing to the small amount that can,  in any case, be obtained in Germany. It will therefore be almost impracticable to send !&apos;extras&quot; if the same limitations are imposed on officers as on men.    The German food is probably more distasteful to the officers than to the me owing to the lack of healthy.appetites.A regulation&apos; as to packing of officers&apos;  parcels under supervision seems to.be advisable.    It was thought that the Central Pri soners- of-T&quot;rar Committee should be asked to., formulate a. scheme for this to be carried out.     This would relieve the Censors&apos; Department of responsibility, would ensure that unauthorised goods,  etc. did not leave the country and would save expense.DERBY.25th April,  1917,&apos;&apos;P.8.telegraphed1 IS^itt,^  &amp; ^following.terms b     (No.991 of 25th April) in the.
