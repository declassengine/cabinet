/E80.NHAG17The chief event of the week has been the conclusionSUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION A^ril IS - April 19. 1917.of the Anglo-Spanish Agreement (April 13) which the Marquis de Cortina was unexpectedly instructed to sign when on. the point of leaving London for Madrid.   The Agreement allows us to take over the greater part of the Spanish shipping in Atlantic ports;    though on the other hand we have to assist in carrying coal to Spain,  he Spanish Minister of Finance continues to obstruct the sailings of our ore ships from Spanish ports &quot;until he has studied the Agreement in detail&quot;;   and it is unfortunate that he retained office under the new Premier.    But the combined pressure of the Bilbao mining interest and of our Ambassador should soon bring him to a more reasonable frame of mind.We have requested the United States not to supply Spain with American coal.     If this request is granted we should have no difficulty in dealing with those influences in Spain which are hostile to our Agreement. The Shipping Controller has already begun to negotiate for the purchase of Spanish ships.The Portugese Government decline to let us use the Austrian shipping whioh is interned in their ports, on the ground that they are not at war with Austria-Hungary. They also desire to retain for their own use some of the German vessels which they promised us.     They can hardly be blamed, in view of the general discontent which has been caused in Portugal by the scarcity of imported food,and of tonnage to carry it.
-     E&quot;She Brasillan Government Have officially disclaimed the intention of requisitioning Serman ships, hut have placed them in the charge of armed guards.The United States have requisitioned the Austrian ships in American ports, and are considering how to use them.     Apparently the President of the Federal Shipping Board is willing to let as charter American tonnage on condition that we desist from applying: our hunker eondi^ tions to U.S. ships -ngaged in the South American trade. -His objection to this part of our hunker control is shared by the State Department, favy Department and Treasury, and therefore it would probably be unwise to contest the point.   We are in fact offering to pat all American ships on an equal footing with British ships, so far as the supply of bunkers is concerned, if it is made impossible for any American ship to start a voyage without a special licence, granted by an American Shipping Controller, for that voyage.     The State Depart-ment, at our request. are considering whether they have the legal power to requisition ships.     If they have the power they are disposed to useit for our benefit.As regards Scandinavian shipping the position has not changed materially since last week.   The Norwegian Government have &quot;practically&quot; decided to accept our tonnage proposal, but have not yet settled how the quantity of tonnage which we desire shall he transferred to Allied trades.   They have the legal power to requisition ships at market rates, but are afraid to use it;   not because the Norwegian people would resent such a step - it would on the contrary be popular in the present state of public opinion - but from a very natural fear of German retaliation
whioh might conceivably take the form of an armed raid by air and sea,     The Swedish Government may, in the opinion of Sir B, Howard, be trusted to open the Kogrund passage as they have promised.     By doing so they will restore 90,000 tons of British and Allied Shipping to active commerce.     They also consent to an arrangement under whioh the Swedish vessels ^hich we have detained shall be released one by one as other Swedish vessels sail from Sweden to the United Kingdom. In the case of Denmark we have to deal with the shipping interest rather than with the Government, and the Danish shipowners are restive at some of our proposals. On the one hand they allege that they cannot spare us any tonnage, because they cannot carry more than half of Denmark^ imports; on the other hand they claim the right to keep their ships in trade between America, Horway and Sweden.     But we are in a position to insist that Denmark shall be served exclusively btjf her own merchant marine, and that any ships which are superflu-ous for Danish purposes shall be made available for Allied trades.Germany now offers to reopen the negotiations with thecDutoh Government for replacing with German ships the Dutch ships lately torpedoed off the Scillies. H.H. Government will raise no objection to the transfer of flag if an equivalent amount of Dutch tonnage is allooated to Allied trades.ALLIED SUPPLIES.     The Argentine Government plead that they cannot possibly spare the 190,000 tons of wheat which we require.    But they will endeavour to meet us in this
f   4   **matter, and appear to view with favour our proposal that we should borrow wheat from them, to he replaced later on by shipments from Australia.    She Argentine Government are particularly anxious to obtain delivery of two tank-steamers which are being built for them in the United States;   they hove learned that delivery will be conditional upon a favourable reply to our requests concerning grain,The Colombian Government are believed to be willing to grant a concession to one of our agents whereby we should virtually control the exoort of cattle from that republic^The grain position in Italy is serious.   The Government state that they have in hand only a few days1 supply for the urban population, and they complain of the continued diversion of grain ships to London.   In the past eight months they have received less than half of their estimated annual requirements, 1,240,000 tons out of  ,900,000.The Mexican Government while disclaiming any intention to stop the export of mineral oil have imposed a heavy export duty.The new German-Swiss Agreement will probably lead to further restraints on the export of munitions from Swiss works to the Allies.     It appears to be urgent that the draft Agreement between the Swiss ana the Allies should be ratified at the earliest moment, since this Agreement will enable the Allies to exercise counter-preseure on the Federal Government.It appears that the new Russian Government will not assist us to obtain any Russian flax of the 1917
-   g   *crop, They have also provea less accommodating than their predecessors as regards the transport arrange-ments at Archangel.- The new proposals of the Swedish Government for a provisional moans Vivendi include better facilities for Russian transit, and can probably be extended to include special services by Swedish shipping in the transports tion of Russian purchases from the U.S.A, to Scandinavian ports.    We are also offered export licences for Swedish goods coming to the United Kingdom.   We can secure theee advantages by permitting export from the United Kingdom to Sweden and by facilitating the passage of reasonable quantities of overseas goods tc Swedish ports.   Sir E. Howard thinks it would be advantageous to accept these terms pending the ratification of the London Agreement.     Sweden is now definitely committed to accept the Rationing Principle.PURCHASING AS RESIDENTS.     Two of the Danish produce boats reretorpedoed last week within forty miles of the Norwegian coast.     Sir R. Baget thinks that the Germans may at any moment begin to attack these boats on the voyage from Jutland to Bergen.     It may thereofre be necessary to make other transport arrangements.   The difficulty which arose last week between the Danish butter exporters and their English buyers is in process of settlement.    H.M. Government are arranging that the Importers shall in future accept delivery of Danish butter at an agreed minimum price, irrespective of the state of the English market.I Ili
It is proposed by the Butoh Minister of Finance that the export, import ana distribution of foodstuffs shall be oontroiled by a Central Bureau.   Though the President of the Landbouw Export Bureau will possibly be a member of the new Bureau, it is not proposed to armoint the gentlemen who are chiefly responsible for the successful working of our Agricultural Agreement. The object of the scheme is probably to facilitate exchanges with Germany, and our interests may suffer.Up to date we have secured 69$ of the season^ catch of Norwegian herring.    The Germans are securing a large percentage of the north-coast catch.     They are also buying immense quantities from the Swedish and Danish fishermen, whom they provide with petroleum and other necessary supplies.    Probably the best way of checking this trade is to threaten Sweden and Denmark with a stoppage of petroleum cargoes from the United States.     The supplies which the Germans can furnish are strictly limited.   The Standard Oil Oo, have already decided not to risk their tank-vessels in further trade with Denmark and Sweden.    This apparently spontaneous decision it should be possible to turn to good account in bargaining with those countries,GBRHA8 SUBMABIHB Bf* 00 KABULThe following is a summary of the losses of merchant tonnage, due to enemy activities, which have been officially reported in the period April XZ - April 19 inclusive.   The figures exclude smacks and trawlers.
