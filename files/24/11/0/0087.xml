gj E T. WAR CABINET..T.587-C.I.G.S., WAR OFEICB, General Delme-Radcliffe.29th April, 1917. Reference your telegram 94-0 of April 20th.   The Italian &quot;1 situation has for a long time past been receiving most careful usideration by Shipping Controller and is still doing so.     Evesy fort is being made to assist.    .Am informed that the great diffi-lty appears to be wagons which the Italian Government are failing supply in sufficient quantities.     Point out to General Cadorna it success of our efforts depends upon the regular supply of a ffici^nt number of trucks for which the Italian Government must iertake responsibility.
