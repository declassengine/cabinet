WAR   CABINETCOAL FOR  italyQopy of lottor, dated 26th April, 1917, fro.? Secretaryoi the War&quot;&quot;Cabinet to Gosbral Sir tf*R. Robortson,G.CB., &amp;oMy dear General,I enclose a copy of a Note which I havo received from Sir E. Wyldborc Smith in regard to General Lolma-RudclifiVs telegram Ho,940 of 20th April, 1917,     I think the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of the note is a good one, and hope that you will instruct General Dolmo Radcliffo in tho sense indicated.Copies of the Note and of this letter are being circulated to tho War Cabinet,Yours sincerely,(Signed) M.P.A. HAMEYENCLOSUREHota by Sir E* Wyldbore Smith.With reference to tho telegram No.940 of tho 2oth April, 1917, from General Delme Radcliffe- to the 0.1*0-8* on the subject of tho coal supply of Italy, the situation is as followsTotal monthly requirements   -* 800,000 tonsTons TonsQuantity of ooal received in Italyduring January,1917 380,327 deficit 419,673*      February, 1917 366,497      &quot;      433,503w      March, 1917 471,753      &quot;      328,247v      April, 1917(first 2 weeks). 193,571      B      206,429In a telegram from Baron Sonn&amp;nfc to the Italian Ambassador in London dated the 25th March, it was stated that the stocks existing in Italy (exclusive of Naval resorvo) on tho 1st February Aid not exceed 950,000 tons.    To augment this quantity it is understood the Italian Authorities decided to transfer 100,000 tons from their naval stocks, making in&amp;ll 1,050,000 tons.     The figures given above show that the cumulative deficits for February, March and tho first 2 weeks in April amount to 968,179 tons, so that If it has been found necessary to make up the full amounts of these deficits, it will be seen that tho 1,050,000 tons of stock must already be almost exhausted.Tho gravity of tho Italian coal situation has been for some time receiving tho most careful consideration of the Shipping Controller, who on the 22nd March was authorised by the War Cabinet, &quot;todivert for a month or so to Italy some of the tonnegs at present allotted to France and to acquaint the Fronsh and
Italian Governments through its proper channels of the action taken&quot; (see Minute 9, War Cabinet 102.)For the month of April, the Shipping Controller has allocated British tonnage sufficient to transport to Italy about 200,000 tons, which with the 205,000 tons for which the Italians have themselves made arrangements will, it is hoped, result in a total of 405,000 tons being landed in Italy during April.With regard to May, it is estimated that with the help of some additional neutral vessels, the Italians will be able to transport about 260,000 tons, to which the Shipping Con-troller hopes to be able to add tonnage sufficient to carry 190,000 tons, making a total of 450,000   tons for the month of May.     The assistance thus rendered by British tonnage is additional to any help which it may be possible to obtain through the withdrawal of British shins at present in the service of France.Every effort is being made from this end to organise the transport of coal to Italy via Blaye, and at ther equest of the President of the Board of Trade, a representative of the Sowth Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway has made two visits to that port with a view to putting the scheme into execution.   He has reported that it should be possible to despatch from Blaye approximately 1,000 tons a day.    So far, however, only about 21,000 tons have been despatched by this route since the latter part of March last.     The great difficulty in making this scheme a success appears to be the lack of wagons, which the Italian Government are failing to supply in sufficient quantities.It is suggested that in reply to   General Belme3 Radcliffe, ho should be instructed to point out to General Ga&amp;orna that the success of the scheme must depend upon a regular supply of a sufficient number of trucks for which,the Italian Government must undertake the responsibility.(Sgd)     E.WYLDSB0PE SMITH.85th April 1917.
