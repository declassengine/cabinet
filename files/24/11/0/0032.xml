SECRETARIAT.(a) Statistical Department.   The total number of National Serv-ice Volunteers enrolled is now 291,234, of which 18,034 were enrolled during the past week.   This Is the smallest number in any week since the scheme was initiated.   The foregoing figures include enrolments in the professional and foreigners&apos; regist-ers, but do not include those in the women&apos;s register which now number 13,414..(b) Central Information Bureau.   The announcement of the changes which are about to take place in the administration of the National Service scheme has resulted in a crop of enquiries at the Bureau with regard &quot;to details, and in ihe receipt of a number of applications for labour.   Arrangements are being made for the setting up of an Imformation Bureau at the Mansion House where two rooms have been offered by the Lord Mayor for this purpose.(o) Passports Department.    The total number of applications for passports examined is 5,634, of which, 3,947 have been agreed to, and 1,687 have been refused.   The number of applications during the week was 554.^) Registry,   The number of letters received during the week was more than 17,000.   The Despatch Section during the same
period dealt with 6,500&apos;letters, 3,000 parcels and 2,400 cir-culars.THE JDIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, reports, with authority of persons recently returned from the United States, that there are a large number of men in that country, of British and Canadian birth, who might be brought over for Military Service, or for use as skilled men in Trades of Primary Importance.   This suggestion has been forwarded to Lord Derby.THE LABOUR ADVISER, during the week has, with the Labour Advis-ory Committee, drafted a circular on the new scheme; for Nation-al Service which circular has been sent round to Trade Unions.He met the Executive Committee of the National Union of Quarry Workers and Sett Makers, who were opposing the Nation-al Service Scheme, and convinced them that they were mistaken as to its objects.He attended^ at Cannock, a large Meeting of the Ledge Tool Makers Trade Society and satisfied them as to the nature of the Scheme and arranged for the men to approach the Employers with the object of a joint conference. PRESS INTELLIGENCE. In addition to the regular distribution of news to the Daily Press, over 80 provincial newspapers are now supplied weekly from this Department with Editorial Articles, and comments on the subject of National Service.   Nearly 200 others are supplied weekly, with a column of news relating to the progress of the movement. AGRICULTURAL SECTION.(a) Military and other,labour on farms.1* Scotland. Reports Continue to show appreciation by the farm-ing community of the assistance given by the Department during the Spring operations,2, England. It has now been arranged that soldiers on furlough
will, in England as well as in Scotland, for which the arrange-ment war- reported last fteek, remain on the land until the dates stated in last week&apos;s report, viz:-Those from Prance, till the 30th April, Men of Category A, till 10th May, All others from the Borne Forces till 25th May. In view of the fact that the men from Category A. are due to return to service on ICth May, and that on some farms all the lent labour will be of Category A, while on others it will be of lower categories, it will be necessary to arrange that on and after the 10th May the re-distribution of the Military Labour available is made in order tOi. secure its employment where most needed.   This is however a-matter outside the purview of this Department as by the decision of the Cabinet the allocation of Military Labour is performed in England by the B/A.(b) National Service Volunteers, The Commissioners continue to interview Volunteers for Agricultur, and, as stated last week in view of the position referred to in paragraph (f) below, there is nothing further to report,(c) Agricultural Companies in Scotland,   There were on 18th April in Agricultural Companies in Scotland a total of 717 men of whom 263 were available in the Depots and the remainder were at work.   Of the men in the Depots 100 had only arrived on the day on which these figures were obtained.Part-time Labour.   The scheme for the utilisation of school-boy labour is now well under way, and it is hoped&apos; at a very early date to submit it in detail.(e) Milk Retailers. The Director has been in touch with the Agricultural Organisation Society on the matter of organising milk retailers throughout the country, with a view to the
i 0. 4 -release of men of military age, and to the formation of com-binations for utilising to better advantage any surplus milk which may be available during the flush season of the year, (f) Substitution.     It is desired to emphasise once again and if possible more strongly than before, since further experience confirms the views previously expressed, that unless the farmers are assured and convinced that no more men will be taken from Agriculture for the Army or, alternatively, unless they are informed that certain men will be taken by certain dates, they will not take on National Service Volunteers be--cause they fear that by so doing they will give ground to tho Military Authorities for taking their men. (&amp;) The Deputy Director. Mr. Horne who has acted as Deputy Director of this Section since the commencement has been appointed to a position of great responsibility under Sir E. Geddes.   His place has been taken by Mr, James Adam, Agricultur-al Commissioner for Scotland. GENERAL TRADES SECTION.(a) Change of Staff. The Deputy Director of the General Trades Section, Mr. R.E. Graves, has been appointed as Director of the new Substitution Section.    The two Sections which will in future report separately will work in the closest co-operation.The Substitution Officers throughout the country will be taken pver on the 1st r;ay.(b) Substitution Volunteers.    The Central Committees already set up in the Building and Printing Trades are making good progress with the campaign in these trades.   Appointments have been made with a number of other trades in which it may be found desirable to operate through Trade Committees.With a view to obtaining substitutes from trades almostc entirely unorganised and miscellaneous occupations it is
Intended to set up local General Trade Committees to be termed rational Service Committees.   Where National Service Recruit-ing Committees are already din existence they will be made the nucleus of the new Committees, other members being added where necessary to give adequate representation to Employers and Employed.A circular will shortly be issued to Local Authorities by the President of the Local Government Board and the Director General of National Service jointly setting forth the principle duties of the now Committees which will include practically all matters connected with the obtaining of Volunteers for National Service in their respective districts.(c) Certified Occupations.   With a view to further alterations in the Certified Occupations List Conferences were held with the operatives in the Cotton Trade and with the Employers and operatives in the Glass Bottle industry.   The new List is now nearly ^complete.(d) Concentration of Trades Department,London Stock Exchange.   In addition to part-time labour previously reported, which is still continuing, an arrangement has been made with Mr. Hooker of the Board of Agriculture for 100 clerks to work 3^ hours daily making a census of cattle; the work to be done at Newington Causeway.

(signed) NEVILLE   CHAMBERLAINDirector-General ofNational Service.The difficulty encountered in London in obtaining names of persons suitable to represent the operatives at the Appeal Courts has been largely overcone.   Nominations have been received from a number of different individualsUnlons, It h hoped, too, that the London Trades Council who refused to make any nominations will now re-consider their decision. 7.
