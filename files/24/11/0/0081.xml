3/Gen.No./7564.ti iy] JLWar &quot;Cabinet.&quot;Parcels for the troops in Prance.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,The position with regard to the sending by individuals of foodstuffs to troops in Prance is roughly as follows -About 800 tons a week go by Parcel Post and 7,000 tons a month are despatched through the Military Forwarding Office at Southampton,  or,  in round -numbers, 10,000 tons a month.The average consumption of the population at home for a month is approximately 550,000 tons.It would appear inadvisable to stop these parcels in view of the large amount of heart-burning there would be on the subject.&quot;There is, however, a stoppage that I think we might make... -With a view to economy of breadstuffs the amount of bread ration to men on the lines, of communication in France has been reduced.     There can be no saving men are allowed to buy any breadstuffs they like, allif of It aswhich comes from England, from the various Canteenssimply means a saving of money and not of breadstuffs, the men get the same amount but have to pay for it instead of getting it as a free ration,     I suggest, therefore, that all Canteens in the.Line of Communication Areas should be prohibited from the sale of breadstuffs except at-Railway Stations;    the Military Authorities in France would regularise this by the issue of breadstuffs (on payment) to the Canteens concerned with Railway work. Canteens in the Army Areas would in no way be restricted in their sales.28.4.17.DERBY.
