WAR   CAB I IB T.SIR ALMROTH WRIGHT&apos;S MEMORANDUM OA1 THE WORK OF &quot; THE R.A.M0C H FRAHCEo .(Copy of letter from Lord Derby to the Prime Minister, dated 28th March 1917).Dear Prime Minister,Sir Almroth Wrightrs views had already been before me, and I have been more carefully into the proposals he made.    I am convinced that no good could come of altering the present system; that all necessary information is forthcoming to enable the-.Medical Department to deal math any eventualities that human foresight can reasonably anticipate may arise; and that any disturbance at the pre-sent moment would only end in chaos.I may mention incidentally that Sir Almroth Wright&apos;s paper resulted in the resignation of the Consulting Surgeons in France, and it was only a personal appeal from myself v/hich secured their further services, and that a Conference called by Sir Alfred Keqgh of all the most eminent Surgeons and Doctors to consider the report, equally resulted in the condemnation by them of his suggestions.I have had the greatest difficulty in smoothing the whole matter over, and I sincerely trust that, having survived one bombshell, I may not be called upon to tackle another thrown by some other party on Sir Almroth Wright&apos;s behalf - and that is really what this memorandum means. It is only Sir A. Wright&apos;s proposition in another form.I have again spoxen to Sir Alfred ZeOch on the sub-ject, and am convinced that he is oetting all the scientific and statistical aid he wants - not only from the Medical Research Committee but also from the College of Surgeons and Physicians.    I beg, therefore, that the matter may be allowed to drop.Yours sincerely,(Sd) DERBY.
