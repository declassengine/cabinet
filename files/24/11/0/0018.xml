76PRIORITY- II CONSTRUCTION Oj1 MINES-TESPffaS, JJD&quot;HaCDoSITY irQR&quot;PROVISION Oj1 MOSS ^oSELS^Memorandum by Hrst Sea Lord,13Tho Secretary,&quot;tfar Cabinet..Our losses in minesweepers have become so heavy that it is necessary to ask the &quot;.7ar Cabinet for sanction to add to our shipbuilding programme in this class of vessel, and,, further, to obtain sanction to give the minesweepers already on order first priority,The situation in regard to construction of thesevessels is as follows: 6 are due for delivery in May, ;, 5 in June, . 3 in July,1 in August,0 in September,and 2 in each of the months October, November and December,In 1918 the deliveries are much better,, and what is necessary now is to push.forward the construction of those due for delivery in 1918... in order that some of them may be delivered, as early as possible in the current year, In addition it is necessary, in my opinion, to order an ad-ditional 50 at once,For both of these measures I request the sanction of the &apos;7ar Cabinet.It is right to state that the figures I have 6iven do not include travelers, some of which as they are completed will be used for.minesweeping; but the delivery of this class of vessel only averages about EO a month and they are needed for patrol as well as minesweeping duties.The serious nature of the position is shcvm by the fact that 19 minesweeping vessels were blown up by mines during April and that the total number of mines swept up in April is 487 as against 213 in January. The number of mines laid by the German submarines is steadily increas-ing and our losses cf minesweepers, increase in proportion. 1st May 1917.. (jd) J.R. JELLICOE.firfta ft
