501. WAR    CABINET./&apos;THE BSMBR UTILIZATION OF ME20DCAL PERSONNELJaMDKNOWLEDGE,- ETC. ETC.Recommendations by the Medical Research Committee.After acknowledging the welcome assistance which Sir Alfred Kcogh had extended &apos; to&quot; them Ah.,the past, the Committee stated that there had been needless delay in the.recovery of the wounded and in the discharge of the permanently disabled, with a consequential waste of man-power and money.     In;th&amp; )r view, this had been due to the absence of adequate scientific know--ledge at the War Office, as well as peripherally: tc the .absence of a proper system of Inspection; to the fact that men of special qualities had not been assigned to themost suitable work: to the wastage of medical man-power: and to the inefficiency of many of the senior medical officers.The Committee made the following recommendations:-( 1 )       The location at the War Office, instead of in France, of the Army Medical Scientific Staff (in particular the appointment of Sir W. Leishman as Director of Pathology in the War Office).( 2 )       The expansion of the medical departments to meet the developement of the military effort of the nation.( 3 )   &apos;   The developement of a proper system of inspection from the War Office to .       control local executive work and its results, and to supervise special medieal problems whichare not adapted to separate treatment by Commands.( 4 )       They made certain recommendations for obtaining better use of medical personnel.( 5 )       Finally, the Committee urged that this was the opportune moment for improving the status of the Director-General of the Army Medical Service,- an^ suggested that he should once again be placed on the Army Council,     In support of this, they referred. to the position occupied by the Heads of the Medical Departments in France and in the United States, and quoted a letter sent on February 3rd to the &quot;Times&quot; by Lord Ssher.      Lord Esher in the most frank manner, expressed regret that the Committee for re-constituting the-War Office, of which he was Chairman, ever took Sir Alfred Keogh off.&apos;the Army Council.     He attributed much of the suffering of the troops in the present war -to the fact that the Head of the- Army Medical Department, instead&apos; of being on the Army Council, has. been, and. Is, under the Ad jut ant.-Generals He appealed publicly to.Lord Derby to.remedy this short-sighted defect &apos;&apos;to the infinite advantage of our sick and wounded to-day and to-moioow.-&quot;
The following events led up to the above proposals &quot;beingmade.Sir Almroth Wright sent the Prime Minister and the Wax Office a Memorandum condemning the Army Medical Administration for not giving sufficient thought to saving the maximum of lives and limbs.     Ho suggested the. appointment of a scientific staff to study the effect of rival methods of treatment, to arbitrate between them and then to proscribe the procedure which should be adopted.     Such a staff should also bo a Medical Intelligence end Investigation Department.Sir Alnroth Wright.made the further points :-(l)   Tho present rapid evacuation iron base hospitals in franco to England is likely to interfere with the treatment of wounds and results in the concentration of doctors in Prance end wounded in England.(-2)   Pie Id Ambulance not-being able to deal with serious cases, their treatment is often long delayed. These ambulances are also extravagant in. medical personnel.Colonel David Davies wrote on behalf of the Prime Minister tc the War Office and to the Medical Research Committee asking for their views on Sir Almroth Wright:s Memorandum, and asking further, whether any other moans could be suggested for utilising more fully scientific knowledge end civilian personnel with a view to the improvement, of treatment, acceleration of recovery and tho further prevention of disease.The War Office replied on January 27th. that after a full discussion with representative medical end surgical men, a resolution had been passed expressing disagreement with Sir Almroth Wright1 s opinions..       The meeting considered that every possible scientific help had been available..     The War Office accordingly considered that no action was necessary.Tho Medical Hesearch Committee replied on February 3rd. that, in their opinion, Sir Almroth Wright&apos;s Memorandum was faulty in bone and perspective, because (a) he based tho
case mainly on the treatment of infected wounds which, though important, is only a special case on which opinion is still divided; (b) he does not give the Tax Office credit for the brilliant results achieved through the application of scientific knowledge in other directions; and (d) he deals throughout with Franco, whereas it is the conditions in the United Kingdom and also particularly in the Mediterranean which need critical attention.The Committee also submitted considerations upon the organisation of the Army Medical Department both in the War Office and in all the area-s of its activity, which are set out at the head of this summary.
