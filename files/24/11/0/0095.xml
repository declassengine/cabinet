5 K C H E T,a G.T. 595oWAR CABINET * From      G.O.C in C, Salonika.To    :-   D.M.I. 25th April, 1917.1,991 24th,Following summary report on the Royalist Forces drawn up by French Headquarters.1.   Regular troops Thessaly:   In accordance with promises of Greek Government admitted that-Regiments of 1st Division now reduced to 640 men each,, with no other rifles than those actually carried by men and without machine guns; officers, however, 48 per Regiment and number of cartridges belonging the Regiments reported passed Corinth control less usual allow-ance for Regiments on War footing.2.   Gendarmerie; total number of gendarmes and police in N Thessaly reasonably estimated 1,500, according to agreement maximum number to be maintained north of canal being 3,000. 3.   Other elements: number officers and men on leave unde-termined, but doubt expressed as to number of reservists who might respond to call of their Committees when question is not one of pillage and shouting but fighting. 4.   Irregulars: owing to police operations south of neutral zone Comitajis have lost their field of action; greater part have gone further south, but numbers previously exaggerated and today they should be reckoned by hundreds only.   Italian advance in Epirus having considerable effect and men generally influenced by vigorous (?) recent repressions have lost much of their enthusiasm.
5.   Arms:   Arms issued to reservists in some region have been definitely recalled and existence of secret depots has never been positively proved*   As is custom in Balkan localities large number of Gras fifles and carbines however are scattered about amongst inhabitants.   Somewhat large stocks of those were discovered in Kipurjos region, but any such stores now existing have been sent South.6.   Spirit of population:    all have suffered from scarcity of supplies.   As they are afraid of mobilisation population does not want Venisselist Authorities in Thessaiy, but probably mobilisation would be considered a leaser evil than prolongation of present, suffering7.   Conclusions: Thessaly 1,920 Regular soldiers, 1,500 gendarmes,  some deserters and men on leave, uncertain number of reservists, less than 1^000 irregulars; but it appears doubt-ful whether all these latter supplementary troops would respond if called upon.   Men are weak in health, poorly equipped, badly clothed supply of ammunition limited, food supply precarious, If Corinth Bridge occupied reinforcements for Thessaly troops can only arrive from Epirus or Attica,   Epirus 1,920 regular soldiers, Attica ditto,  regular Infantry with 480 cavalry, 1,500 gendarmes distributed through whole of centralGreece. All machine guns and artillery transferred to Peloponnese.   As communications difficult little consideration need be given to possibility of reinforcement of troops in Thessaly.    Only reinforcement possibly to be feared but which will be limited by arms at its disposal would be constituted, by soldiers 1914 class who are returning to Attica and may move to Thessaly.
Ope rati on 3 * S E C R E , T .C-inC, Salonika to C.I.G.S. 27*4.1917*G.C. 991.   27-4-1917. Handed in at 9.30 p.m. Your 33420 Cipher,Please see information contained in my 1.991 to D.M.I.April 24th, with which I am in general agreement.   Greek Armyis impotent from a military point of view6   The Comitajismovement appears to be local and exaggerated and the Frenchand Italian detachments seem to keep it well in hand.   Thepetty and obstructive tactics of the Government at Athenscannot be looked upon as a military menace.   Matters will notbe mended by the removal of the King and his replacement byhis son who ?practically holds the same views as- his fatherunless Douamania and the present General Staff are changed andsteps taken to ensure that neither they nor the Royal circleshall interfere in the future policy of the country.   Force mightwould most probably be required for the removal of the Queen.For military action in Thessaly I see no necessity and foroffensive action in this theatre I consider the Allied forceshere are the minimum.   X strongly deprecate for this reasonany withdrawal of troops from operations which may in a campaignsomeresulting only in territorial acquisition give/definite military result is -
