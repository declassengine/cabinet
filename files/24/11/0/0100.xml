WAR CABINET.

FOR INFORMATION OF WAR CABINET FROM FIRST SEA LORD.



With reference to the discussion at the War Cabinet Meeting on 22nd April, on the subject of large Grain Carriers, it has been ascertained that the Slips on which such vessels could be built are :-

Armstrongs          ...    3



Boardmore            ...   1



Brown               ...   1



Cammell Laird       ...   1

  

Fairfield           ...   2



Harland &amp; Wolff     ...   2



Swan Hunter         ...   1



The probable order of preference would be :-



(1) HARLAND &amp; WOLFF. With 2,000 tons for a big ship already laid and which could be worked in.

(2) ARMSTRONGS.      Either clear one slip of 3 sloops in 6 weeks&apos; time, or, take up "ANSON", (1,200 tons) in about same time.

(3)CAMMELL LAIRD.    Could be cleared of "HOWE" (1,100 tons), in 6 weeks.
