/l^u. 1,59-6 k/A. .153/15./ ^^IIM^P^ 383AIR BOARD. Report to tho Cabinet.28 th April, 1917.General      I. An important Conference has taken placs this weekPolicy.    between the Air Board and a French Mission, composed ofl/u Daniel Vincent, Under-Secretary of State for Aviation at the French Ministry of War, Me Flandin, the French Delegate on tho Inter-Allied Aviation Bureau recently established in Paris and a number of French officers.The object of the Conference was to secure th*s co-ordination of orders for aeronautical material to bo placed in America for the British and French Governments.Sir L. Worthington EvanB, on behalf of tho Minis-try of Munitions attended part of the Conference and con-curred in the conclusions.It was agreed that the programme of orders in America should be reciprocally communicated by the two Governments and that a further Conference should shortly be held to discuss these programmes with a view to preventing competition in the American market and to securing an equitable distribution between the two Countries of tho material so ordered.    Similar Conferences would take place every two months^    If, owing to unforeseen circumstanced, further orders had to bo plaoed &quot;by Prance or England hel tweenttev Conference notice would be given to the other par-ty who would reserve the right of participating in the order.     The number and types of engines to be ordered in America would be limited as much as possible by previous agreement between the Air Board and the French Aeronautical Department.It was further decided to draw the attention of the Shipping Controllers of-the two Countries to the ad-Tisability of giving such priority of transport as might be possible to the aeronautical material ordered in America.II. The Board have had before them a letter fromGeneral Trenchard, Commanding th Royal Flying Corps in France, ,on the subject of the number and types of machines which the B.H.F. will require next year.     His reoommenda-tions are being considered in connection with the preparation of the programme to which allusion was made in the Report to tho week of the 21st instant.     General Tronchard xaysi special stress on the importance of concentrating on a sin-gle-seater fighter.     There are, at present, in the ex-perimental stage, two designs of this type of machine, one a Sopwith and the other a Spad, to take rotary enginos; while two other designers are at work on designs to take the forthcoming 200 h.p. B.I-I.P. stationary engine.HI* Arrangements have been made to obtain from&apos;Italy6 sample engines of a new 500 horse power type,, designed by Hessrs. Fiat.     The developments of aeronautics point to the probability that engines of this power will before long be in use.    The Italians have made a special study of them-1-
and we may have much to gain from -utilising their oxperienoe.IV, An American citizen resident here, Mr, Rudd, whois interested in machine gun production, recently made an offer to his Government to equip and train a machine gun detachment in this country-^     The American Government roj*. -plied! that tho best service&apos; ho could render was to equip and train-a squadron of airmen recruited from Americans living in the United Kingdom-     Mr. Rudd made an offer accordingly whioh has been considered by the Board.     It was pointed out that to whatevor extent the facilities needed wore supplied from this Country, our own Forces would have to go short. Wo have not the labour to mako tho aerodrome, nor material for the sheds, nor aeroplanes or engines, to spars.     It is doubtful whether Mr. Rudd oould enlist in this Country the mechanics required, nor would the pilots1 training be com-pleto unless they went to our Gunnery Schools which are al-ready fully occupied4     On tho other hand, tho American Government have boen made aware that if they desire that &quot;a few Americans should be trained in ou.. Schools we should be glad to arrange this*     It was agreed that it would bo far preferable that American pilots should be trained in America where the facilities are unlimited.ipply.     ?.
