FIDENTIAL.MINISTRY OF PENSIONS. Report for Period from 14th April to 20th. April 1917.The work of re-assessing Pensions under the Royal rrant of the 29th March is proceeding on the whole satis-&apos; factorily.       In addition to the permanent pensions which were practically all re-assessed by the date - April 4th -on which the Warrant came into force, 5158 conditional pensions to soldiers have been re-assessed on coming up for renewal since that date, 1500 appeals against decisions and other claims to revision under the new Warrant have been dealt with and 400 gratuities in non-attributable and non-aggravated cases have been granted.   This work has of course been carried on simultaneously with fresh awards.   The number of these increased very considerably in the week owing it is&quot; believed to the Military Authorities clearing hospitals in view of the new advance.Appendix I shows the progress made with Dependants re-assessments.   Of 694 cases settled, 375 persons have had their pensions increased by an average of nearly 4/- a 7/eek, 319 receive no additional pension.Appendix II shows the progress in the work of re-examination as to entitlem,nt.   254 widows who have been refused pensions have now been admitted under either Article 11 or Article 15; 52 Aggravation (gratuity) cases have been granted pension under Article 11, and*&apos;ll claims have been finally rejected.     156 Dependants have been admitted to pension or gratuity; 2 have been rejected.212.  3. grants have been made during the week. Reports of casualties in connection with the present offensive are not yet being received by the Y/idows and Dependants Award Branch.Apart from the somewhat slow progress of the re-assessments the state of the work of that branch is satis-factory.   All current cases are up to date.
the2. Further discussion on the subject of/treatmentof the non-attributable and non-aggravated- cases, referred to in the second paragraph of last week&apos;s Report, took place in the House of Commons on the motion for the adjournment on the 17th instant.   Mr. Hogge pressed for the publication of the scale of the gratuities to be given in these cases.   Mr. Barnes declined to give this information on the grounds that the scale could not be based on specific injuries but had to take service and other considerations into account, and that the publication of the rough experimental scale that had been drawn up by the Ministry   , for their ovm guidance would, unless accompanied by much explanation be misleading.Preliminary steps have been taken to constitute an Appeal Tribunal to deal   ith these cases. 3. The Form of Accounts to be adopted by theMinistry has been agreed to with the Treasury Officers of Accounts.An audit of the re-assessments of Widow1s Pensions has been commenced by the Finance Division of the Ministry.   The results were very satisfactory, only six errors, and those of small amount, being found in 6,000 awerds examined.   It has consequently been decided that only a test audit (which will considerably reduce the labour required) is necessary for the remaining cases.Poubts having  been raised by the Director of Finance.as Accounting Officer of the Department, whether Articles 6 of the Order in Council and Royal Warrant were so worded as to enable the Department to deal with disabled Pensioners undergoing treatment or training in the liberal manner intended by the Minister of Pensions, in order to secure that such treatment or training should be readily undergone by those concerned, the matter has been laid before the Treasury in the letter of Which a copy is attached. (Appendix III)..
4..       A statement Of the work of the Statutory Committee for tho week ending the 10th instant Is an*fo $&amp; as Appendix IV,An interesting report was received by them, the w$i?&amp; of various sub-committees in the West Riding of Yorkshire where the bulk of the discharged disabled Committee are Colliers- who look    i with no favour on any system of training and little on any pro-posal for treatment.    -Where the men are fit for work they go back to their old pits and if not fit for work below, are content to work on the surface..     In Buckinghamshire an the other hand, treatment appears to be welcomed.     Reports on the working of the Edmonton &amp; Co Antrim Committees are satisfactory.Difficulty is reported in getting from Local Committees their returns that are necessary to keep the Ministry and later on Parliament informed of the nature and extent of the work being carried tut   with public money in several parts ofthe countryA training scheme for   Bristol has been approved and further training proposals from the Local Committees of Bristol Kent,   Middlesex, Swindon, Walthamstow and Wiltshire are in various stages of consideration.5. For some time past it has been evident that many of themore important dunies of the Statutory Committee were, as a result of the working of Section 3 of the Ministry of Pensions Act either passing to that Ministry or were being carried out by the Committee as Agents, of the Ministry.     As a result of this the Committee at their Meeting of the 19th instant on the motion of Sir Samuel Provis passed a Resolution to the effect that in their &apos; opinion the time had arrived; when these functions under the Kaval and Military War Pensions, etc Act, 1915, should, subject to tho necessary modifications, be transferred to the Ministry of Pensions6.. On the 11th instant the Minister of Pensions receivedat
at the City Chambers, Glasgow, deputations representing (1) the Labour Group of the City Council, (2) the Mother-well Trades and Labour Council, and (3) the Rational Association of Stonemasons.     The Labour Councillors urged the necessity of State institutions for discharged mentally deficient Soldiers and Sailors, or alternatively, the provision of -onerous supplementary allowances for their care and treatment in private nursing homes,     The Motherwell delegates complained of delay in assessing pensions.     The Stonemasons dealt with the unfitness of their members for military service on account of pre-disposition to phthisis.     Medical evidence and Statistic were furnished showing the susceptibility to lung disease of journeymen masons and the relative high mortality rates within the ages of eligibility for Service.     Military training was declared to have aggravated the disease and in some cases had proved fatal.On the 12th instant the Minister of Pensions and Parliamentary Secretary visited the Scottish Naval and Military Veteran&apos;s Residence, ./hitefor$ Mouse, Edinburgh.     Represent-ations, were made regarding the inadequacy of pensions for disabilities caused, in previous wars.Later, on the same date, the Ministers visited the Scottish Tlinded Soldiers and Sailors Most el, Uev/ington Mouse where a deputation representing the Governing Eody was received. An appeal was made for the recognition by the Ministry cf this Hostel for.the training of N.C,0s and men of Scottish regiments blinded in war.     The suggested establishment of a Central Re istry at St. Dunstans was welcomed.On the 12-Ch instant, also, the Minister of Pensions and Parliamentary Secretary attended a Conference of Local Mar Pensions Committees within the Edinburgh area, including Fife, the Lothians and the Border Counties.     The primary object ofthe
the Conference was to consider organisation with a view to ntilising available resources for training disabled men. Considerable discussion tooh&quot; place on the general question of pensions and the after-care of Soldiers and Sailors and it was ultimately resolved to approve of the proposal to establish a joint committee for each of the four divisions of Scotland.During the evening of the 12th instant, the Minister addressed a largely attended meeting held under the auspices of the Edinburgh Trades and Labour Council in the Oddfellows Hall, Edinburgh;     Representatives of all the local industrial organisations of the city were present and much interest was manifested in the discussion of the new Royal Warrants,Amongst the many allegations of hardship attributed to various causes was one declaring that a man had been required by his Commanding Officer to sign an undertaking renouncing all claim to pension or gratuity in respect of his service as a condition precedent to discharge.On the 15th instant the Minister of Pensions and Parliamentary Secretary attended a Conference of Local liar Pensions Committees representing the Black i7atch Territorial area, held at the Town Hall, Dundee.     Delegates were present from Fife, Cupar and Kinross.     Resolutions were adopted approving provisional arrangements for establishing a Joint Committee for Central Scotland,At night the Ministers addressed a well-attended meeting of representatives of local organisations, over which the Lord Provost presided.     The desirability of making loans of small sums to enable trained pensioners to commence occupation was raised and the availability for this purpose of the bonus payable under the Royal -/arrant was made clear.Lator in the evening the Ministers received, a deputation from the Dundee Disabled Soldiers and SailorsAssociation
Association when the provisions of the Warrants in respect of pensions and after-care were discussed.-    The delegates thought no payment should he made to men of Home Service only.On the 14th instant the Minister of Pensions and Parliamentary Secretary addressed a large and enthusiastic meeting of representatives of Local Jar Pensions Committees and kindred organisations in Trinity Hall, Aberdeen.     The proposals to establish Joint Committees for four divisions of Scotland was favourably received.     The Minister explained the proposal to set up boards composed of employers and employed to determine rates of wages.Subsequently a Committee was appointed to prepare a scheme for the treatment and training of disabled men.Later the Minister visited the Orthopaedic workshops of Oldmill Hospital and the Craibstone Experimental Farm where disabled men are trained in agricultural work and forestry 7. Table I-shows that 10,727 new pensions includingchildren1s allowances were granted during the week, against 7,387 during the previous week, and 10,716 in the week before that.   It may be expected that recent numbers will be equalled or exceeded in the weeks immediately a&amp;ead.   595,414 pensions, including children&apos;s allowances have been granted since the beginning of the war up to the 18th instant.Table II shows that last week 173 grants of Supplementary Pensions and children5s allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 197 in the previous week and that the total number tondate is 3433.8. Table III shows that the male staff of the Ministryhas been decreased by 15 in the Award Branches and the female staff increased by 54, distributed over the branches generally. The personnel now consists of 181 men and 2593 women and numbers 2774 in all.The
The staff of the Statutory Committee shows a small increase and consists of 85 men and 164 women or 259 in all, bringing the grand total to 3,023,The daily absence owing to sickness in the female staff of the Tate Gallery has gone down from 13*4 to 9*4 per cent of the total.     It is hoped that the relief from over-crowding consequent .bm additional space at the Gallery becoming available on vacation by the War Office in the course of last week will result in a further reduction in the Tate Gallery absence percentage.   At Chelsoa this percentage has risen among the female staff from 3&apos;4 to 7 and owing to measles at Marylebone at the Pension Issue Office from 5&apos;2 to 8*8.Li. N.21st April 1917.

They are; those of persons who had no real status, as Dependants but they must &amp;f course be looked into again.
Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to acquaint you that his attention has been drawn to the fact that Article 6 of the recent Royal Warrant and of the corresponding Order in Council regulating Disablement Pensions for Soldiers and Sailors do not clearly carry out the intentions with which he had them framed. He has stated these decisions in public utterances in the House of Commons and elsewhere, and understands them to be the decision of the Government.The doubt as to the Interpretation arises in two respects:-(1)   It is argued that, under Subsection (1), (a) of the Article any balance available after deducting maintenance etc, from the man&apos;s pension must be deducted from the further allowances to be made for a wife, &amp;c,   whereas Mr. Barnes intended that such deduction should be made only in the case of men permanently maintained in an institution &amp;c, and that, even then some pro-vision should be made (as has been definitely decided in the case of lunatics) for the manfs personal expenses and comforts (upon further consideration as explained below, he would prefer to forego this deduction) in the case of men sent for a period of curative treatment, or of training, for the reasons explained later he did not propose to make any deduction.(2)   It is argued that under Subsection (2) of the Article the deduction on account of the man1^ maintenance must represent the actual cost charged to the Ministry, or some average rate approximately representing this cost.In this case also Mr. Barnes had intended to distinguish between the cases of men sent permanently to an institution (e.g. an asylum), whose families are virtually in the position of those bereaved, and the cases of men sent for a period of treatment or training, recovering the full cost in the former cases and a portiononlySecretary, The Treasury,S.W.1,
only &quot;on account of the cost&quot; in the latter case.Mr. Barnes still holds, as a personal opinion, that technically the Article gives him the powers which he intended; but he is psspared to admit that it is capable of the other interpretations, especially in view of the correspondence (Treasury Papers 6484/17) regarding one class of case under.it (viz. Lunatics), and may have been so read by the Treasury.   He therefore desires to place the matter beyond doubt, and to issue  -amended regulations at once, if the Lords Commissioners think this necessary, otherwise upon a convenient occasion for issuing classifying amendments shown by experience to be desirable.As already stated, he draws a sharp distinction between Permanent and Temporary cases * In the former he fears that the family must accept the unfortunate position of quasi-bereavement, and adjust their mode of living accordingly.     He would, therefore, charge the full cost of maintenance (possibly for accounting con-venience represented by an average rate) and a reasonable amount for the man^ extra comfort and pocket money, against his pension, and give the family the allowance as for a widow &amp;c.   He would, however, allow them in addition the benefit of any small balance of -the man&apos;s own pension not used for the man himself.   This is a concession above that previously proposed, for which he asks their Lordships&apos; sanction.   Otherwise he is not contemplating a departure from the arrangements agreed to in the case of Lunatics. In the case of men undergoing comparatively short courses of treatment or training, there are very urgent reasons for especially generous treatment.     The restoration of the disabled to such degree of health and efficiency as is possible is perhaps the most important problem arising out of the war; not only a duty of the State to those who have suffered in its service but a duty to the State Itself, as the resulting increase of prosperity must far outweigh the extra cost of even very liberal inducements to the men to undergo such courses.It
It is clear to Mr. Barnes that very liberal inducement Is absolutely necessary.     The men generally dislike or fear treat-ment or training.     They are averse to coming again under the necessary discipline.     They are unwilling to part again from their family and friends.   , There is for the moment a great demand for male labour, and they fail to realise sufficiently that after the war, unless their condition improves, they will be crowded out by able-bodied men; and that to their future competitors there must be added a large number of women workers who have established them-selves during the war shortage of skilled labour.     In addition they fear that during their absence, their families will be in reduced circumstances - which for reasons stated would often In fact be the case unless very generous treatment is granted.Mr. Barne3 has already strong reasons to think that the threat of redusing pension (which would always be invidious and difficult to enforce) will have little effect, at any rate during the present eager demand for workmen, and the opportunity of cure in most cases will be lost if the men defer the acceptance of treatment or training until after the war.For these reasons he proposes to deal with their cases, in the respects under consideration, as follows:-(1)   The further allowance to the wife &amp;c, will be paid in full without any deduction on account of any balance of the man*s pensior   which he can make available to assist them.(It will not be overlooked that In many cases e.g. when the man is under Instruction at a distance and boarded out, the amount required for his own use will be considerable, and the balance small.)(2)   The deduction to be made for the man!s own maintenanco will be at the uniform rate of l/- a day; the rate at present charged in Army Hospitals.This
This will put -all men in an equal position, not dependent upon the-expensiveness of the particular institution which happens to have room for them, or to which their particular disability enforces resort.The two proposals combined admittedly put a man usually in a better financial position while undergoing treatment or training than if he declines to undergo them.     This is the Minister&apos;s deliberate Intention; and he considers that no expenditure could more wisely and profitably be undertaken by the State.     The sum involved even if as many as 5,000 discharged men (a number con-siderably in excess of that anticipated) are constantly under treatment v/ould be small compared with the gain in effectivo labour that may be expected to be derived from it.The&apos; question is of extreme urgency as many cases aro in hand, and, pending their Lordships1 sanction, Mr. Barnes has found it necessary to order action upon these lines.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) Matthew Nathan.
APPENDIX.IV. WAP PENSIONS &amp;c, STATUTORY COMMITTED.REPORT TO THE PENSIONS MINISTER. ?or week ended 18th April, 1917.ORGANIZATION BRANCH.Extracts from reports of Inspectors of Accounts.Our Inspector reporting on Edmonton Local &quot;Committee states that a representative has been appointed on the Committee for each of the three wards of the District, who in cases cf urgency is authorised to make a minimum advance of the amount of one weekTs Separation Allowance and to whom applications for advice and assistance may he made as well as at the central office,, The whole work, including visiting, is done by membersof the Committee, who report to the Subcommittee dealing with the class of case involved.     All applicants are interviewed by the appropriate Sub-Committee unless bed-ridden when a special visit is made.     Every soldier reported discharged and every widow whose case is notified is at once visited and a written report&apos;made on a special form kept ror the purpose.Our Inspector reporting on the Mexborough Sub-Committee of the West Riding Local Committee for Yorkshire states that all discharged men are colliers and practically all working again at their old pits.     A few have undergone treatment.Regarding Ardsley Sub-Committee, the same Inspector reports that there are 20 cases of discharged soldiers, all of whom have been found suitable work with the exception of one case where the man is being sent to Bournemough.Regarding Wombwell Sub-Committee, he states that all discharged men are colliers, that no training has been required and that generally colliers will not listen to any training proposals. They can nearly always get back to their old pits and if not fit to work below they are quite content to work on the surface.Regarding Linthwaite Sub-Committee, he reports that as regards discharged men, there have only been about a dozen up to date, with no complications except in two cases&apos;.   The first of these is that of Sergeant Wright Cockroft,    This man was discharged with a wooden limb, the left arm above elbow, fitted at Roehampton six months ago, and though he has given it every trial he cannot wear it as it is too heavy and clumsy and gives him pains in his head. *. The Committee are taking the matter up to enable him to get a lighter limb.     The second case is that of a single man, discharged with consumption and no pension. .   It was well-known, in the district that the man was unfit before he was called up and that there is consumption in the family..   He earned 33/- a week up to the date of entering the Army but now cannot work at all,     He is undergoing treatment at home but refuses to enter a sanatorium.;
Regarding leatherstone Sub-Committee, the same Inspector reports that there are over 100 oases of discharged men, the majority of whom have resumed their old employment.    Verj many of these cases have been awarded low pensions of a few shillings a week though totally unfit for viork and applications for Supplementary Pensions are pending in many of these cases and help is being given under the Regulations meanwhile.This is entirely a colliery district and it is most difficult to get colliers to listen to any scheme for training or treatment.     One man who was sent to a sanatorium returned after a few days and declared he was being starved.Our Inspector for Buckinghamshire Local Gommittee states that there are 426 oases of disabled men, of whom 234 have returned to thoir previous employment, 10 have been helped financially and 182 have received treatment.Our Inspector in Ireland reports on Antrim County Local Committee as followsThe organization in this County is very good.   The Local Committee consists of 28 members.   There were two labour members on the Committee but they refused to act.     There are 24 Sub-Committees, who dispense money in emergency cases but refer all other metters to. the Local Committee.   Pensions and Separation Allowances are considered satisfactory and every application under those heads is carefully investigated before being sent forward. There are 82 discharged soldiers in the County, nearly all of whom have pensions, a lar y number of them have gone back to their former employment.Protests regarding the completion of Monthly Returns and the Disablement Register required for the Pensions Minister have been received from the Isle of Wight Local Committee, Glamorgan Local Gommittee and Luton.     All these Committees strongly resent having to complete returns and have protested against being obliged to corn-ply with the instructions in the circular issued on the subject.DISABLEMENTS BRANCH.Training and Employment Section.The&apos; Section have received further information on Training Schemes submitted by Bristol and Walsall.   They have approved that submitted by Bristol but have been unable to approve that submitted by Walsall under which the local Committee desire to train and employ a number of disabled soldiers with a local firm in the manufacture of Gramaphone and Telephone Boxes &amp;c.Tho Section have received a report from tho Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to the effect that the Agricultural Colony at Patrington is full and that the other Colonies are not yet ready for occupation.     The question of the transfer of men from the Agricultural College, Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, which is being closed, to the Wye Agricultural College in Kent, has been considered and the fees to be paid in respect of Training and Maintenance of those and other cases has been agreed at  2 oer head per week (14/- per week maintenance and 26/- per week fees) for the 11 weeks of the term.
3, The Section have considered further Training proposalsfrom the local Committees of Bristol, Kent., Middlesex, Swindon, Walthamstow and V/iltshire.It has been decided that further information as to the local conditions should be obtained from Swindon and Wiltshire;    that the Kent Local Committee should be asked to meet the Statutory Committee and discuss their proposals;    that information be sought from the Board of Education with regard to the Technical Training proposals of the Middlesex Local Committee and that approval be given conditionally to the part scheme of Bristol and to the Agricultural Scheme of Walthamstow.4. The Section have considered the offer of a farm inKent for the use of Disabled Soldiers but owing to the ,adverse report of tho Board of Agriculture and Fisheries the offer has been declined with thanks.5. A Scheme for the making of Shell Baskets has beenrejected as it is work which will cease at the end of the war and the gentleman who suggested the scheme in question has boen referred to the %r Office.6. T^ S0ction have had under consideration the questionof the training of Disabled Men in driving Agricultural Motor Tractors.   This matter is to be further considered in.conjunction with the Board of Agriculture and EisherieSc7. The Section have approved of a suggestion made by theMinistry of Labour that there should be separate Trade Advisory Committees for Boot Repairing and for Machine Boot Making.8. Tho Section have received proposals from the ManchesterLocal Committee for training Disabled Men as Electrical Sub-Station Attendants.PENSIONS BRANCH.Representatives of the Statutory Committee attended a Conference at the Ministry of Pensions on the 13th April to arrange the procedure to be adopted in adjusting Supplementary Pensions and Special (Temporary) Allowances granted by the Statutory Committee with the awards of minimum and alternative pensions under the new Royal warrant.     The report of the Conference has been considered by.the finance Sub-Committee and subject-to the concurrence of the Pensions Minister, they heve approved the proposed arrangements.
