Statement of Purchases &amp; of wheat &amp; Flour Maize &amp; United Kingdom Account. Stocks of Wheat, Flour, Maize &amp; Rice in Port Warehouses &amp; in tho hands of Millers at Ports, on April 1st, 1917 .&apos;tI submit for the information of the War Cabinei ummary tables showing the position on the 14th instant as egards the provision of wheat, flour, maize and rice for the nited Kingdom.     -I propose to supply similar tables each week.Itis necesss ,ade in November last ( inary to explain that under an agreement v ,       continuation of an r-ira.:g jr.cnt&apos;- which ;w as ntered into in January 1916), all purchases of -wheat, flour and ,aize are made, by- the Wheat Commission, on joint account of the nited Kingdom, France and Italy,     The purchases are allocated if the Wheat Executive ( which consists of representatives of the hree Governments ) in agreed proportions.One of the main principles of allocation is that each ountry should draw supplies from the nearest source .   Thus wheat rom India would go preferably to Italy, and from North America o this country.JgardedThe position indicated In these tables cannot be as satisfactory.     I understand that the programme arranged ] the Wheat Commission with the Transport Department in November ast provided for arrivals between November 1st and March 51st, of ,510,COO tone of wheat.       Owing to the difficulty of finding triage the&apos; quantity actually brought was only 2,130,000 tons, a tficiency of 380,000 tons, or about three weeks&apos; supply.The demand which I have made Is that at all costs jnnage sufficient to bring 700,000 tons per month to the United &apos;ngdcm, must be provided.   This will only give by the end of ily the minimum quantity which I have already submitted to the binet, and which constitutes a safe basis, viz. a reserve stock bivalent to 13 weeksJ consumption.I recognise the urgent demands upon our diminishing nnage for other services, but I submit that take priority&apos;of breadstuffs.nothing shouldbe allowedThe position is complicated by our obligations to our lies.       France and Italy, at our urgent request, joined with us buying,, with a view to eliminating competition in the exporting ^triesv     They agreed to abstain from buying on their own account, 3 to place all orders through the Tiriti^h Vhcat Commission, hence are responsible) for keeping them supplied.  .,
I submit that the War Cabinet should definitely rule at the requirements of breadstuffs shall have priority in tonnage ver ail other shipments to. this country, and that the French and taliah-Governments should be requested, through the Foreign Office, io make a similar rule in respect of all tonnage under their control.The co-operation- of the American Government in regard to food supplies will, it is to be hoped, result in a considerably l/r-ser quantity of wheat becoming available for export from the rated States than is now apparent, and I suggest that the provision of tonnage should be so arranged as to be able to meet this contingency.       I have instructed the Wheat Commission to continue to buy ail the wheat that can be obtained either In the United iates or Canada.?Cth April, 1917(Signed)       DEV0i?P0ATTable A.STOCKS   IN   THE   UNITED   KINGDOM.Stock as on April 15thc(adjusted)   0Estimated probable Suock four weeks1 Q T, -^-&quot;l___UWheatMaize Rioe Larley CatsSugarTons1,159,000153.061,000 425,000 403,000 13,573;023,000 220;000 -68&apos;, COO 382,000 x 63,000 x 45,5600 Based on the returns of actual stocks collected on the 1st of each month from the Port Granaries and Millers, and estimates of stocks in farmers&apos; and bakers1 hands .x Estimated on.the assumption that Imports continue at the same rato as in the last four weeks.
