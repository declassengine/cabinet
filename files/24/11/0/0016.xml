SBC g S T.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; WAR CABINET,G.T.516.THE PROPOSED RECOIOTITUTION OF THE WAS TRADE ADVISORY COMMITTEE.Memorandum by tho/ Reconstruction Committee.The reduction, of the number of Committees now in existence is obviously desirable and the real question which arises upon this proposal is whether in view of the appointment of the Ministry of Blockade Committee the continuance of the War Trade Advisory Committee is necessary. If not, the energies of its members and of the staff which it employs ought to be diverted to more urgent matters.The reasons urged for the reconstitution of the Committee fall under two heads(l) Questions relating to trade and supplies immediately connected with the War. ,(2) Similar post-war questions,(1)   Questions, immediately connected with the War;The proposed terms of reference are very wide and&apos; the number of Departments affected would ho large.     I subjoin a list which does not claim to be exhaustive.     It is proposed to get over this difficulty by the appointment of a small General Purposes Committee with wide powers to appoint J5x-.&apos;b-Oommittees and to make recommendations without reference to the main Committee.I think that more information is required to show the necessity for the continuance of the Committee and the kind of questions, with which it would be called upon to deal. The Italian Silk question is not a convincing Illustration, I understand that the proposal referred to was one which hardly needed a Committee and which was in fact disposed of in one meeting of less than an hour1a duration.It seems to me that the interposition of an unwieldy Committee of the kind proposed is likely only to impede the settlement of important questions,     The expedient of a ,small General Purposes Committee with plenary powers nominated in the way suggested by Sir Francis Hopwood rather than upon the principle of Departmental representation affords no guarantee that ,a particular Department will be represented as it would wish upon a question affecting it, and really amounts to an admission that the main Committee is unworkable. The report,of the Sub-Committee :(Heading (;2) section .6 on page 0&quot;) attaches importance to -ensuring the attendance as Departmental representatives of the particular officials who have the conduct of the question under consideration.     The conclusion pointed to would seem to he that any inter-depart-nental questions which cannot be settled in the ordinary way of business should be referred to ^ad hoc Committees as they arise.
Such Committees had much &quot;better: he appointed by the Departments concerned than &quot;by the proposed General Purposes Committee which would he an unnecessary piece of machinery likely to create friction.(2)   Post-Far Questions/The&apos;question-whether the Committee reconstituted.- as proposed is necessary for war purposes and what should he -its terms of reference.is&quot;however mainly a matter for the executive Departments concerned  more especially the Board of Trade, Ministry of Munitions and the Contract Departments of the War Office- and &quot;-Admiralty)&apos;. &apos; The Reconstruction Committee is directly interested in &quot;the proposal that the wide terms of reference suggested should he liberally con-etrued in order to enable the new body also to deal with post-war&quot; -conditions in relation to present war trade policy.     At present : the numerous post-war problems are being considered by the Department responsible and by the Reconstruction Committee with its network of&apos; Sub-Committees,    : Doubtless; Departments and Committees- dealing with immediate war questions often find that decisions which they may take or recommendations, which they may wish to puit forward will affect the position after the &quot;War.&apos;    But to set up a new Committee to deal&apos;with post-war questions independent of and parallel with the Reconstruction Committee can only lead to endless confusion,: overlapping, and contradictory recommendations..  The difficulties of co-ordination under present arrangements are already sufficiently -&apos;-serious.     Whatever may be now the intention, the reconstituted &quot;War Trade Advisory Committee could not fail to develop a post-war -commercial policy of its own and to claim a continued ^existence in order to see it carried . out..When it is found that decisions which must be taken in connexion with the war are likely to affect post-war policy, the proper, course is, I submit, that the Department or Committee res-ponsible should inform the Reconstruction Committee *   Or if the decision one way or the other does not necessarily depend upon the immediate necessities of the war, but may be influenced by post-war considerations, the Reconstruction Committee should be consulted &quot;beforehand,   The solution is not to be found in setting up an independent Reconstruction Committee under another name or in entrusting reconstruction problems to bodies constituted for other purposes.If therefore the re-organisation of the War Trade Advisory Committee is necessary for purposes connected with the Conduct of . the war, its reference should be very carefully defined and it should not be authorised to make recommendations on post-war policy.
