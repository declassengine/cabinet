SgCKET O.T. 567WAR   CABIMT.Merchant Shipbuilding.Report of &amp; Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W. on Thursday, April 26th, 1917 ai 3.15 p.m.present: -The Prime Minister   (in the Chair)Lord CurzonMr. HendersonDr. Addison&apos;Sir E. CarsonSir Joseph MaclayRear-Admiral F.C.T. TudorSir E. Tennyson-d&apos;Eyncourt     andThe Members of the Shipping Control Committee andthe Shipping Controllers Shipbuilding AdvisoryCommittee.Lieut.- Colonel Sir M,P.A. Hankey,    Secretary.Captain Clement Jones, Assistant Secretcry.The Prime Minister stated that he had been informed hy the Shipping Controller that at the present rate of construe-tion the output of merchant shipbuilding this year would he approximately double that of 1916, namely, 1,000,000 tons gross this yezx as against 550,000 tons last year.      He pointed out that this rate of increase was not nearly large enough and therefore he hod called the meeting together to confer as to what could be done in order still further to accelerate merchant shipbuilding.The Shipping   Controller submitted a statement prepared in accordance with War Cabinet 125, Minute 12 (c) showing that if the supply of steel were increased from the present weekly amount of 13,000 tons to 16,000 tons weekly then, with the present number of workmen, the year&apos;8   output would he increased to 1,30C ,000 tons gross.Mr. Carter, of the Shipbuilding Advisory Committee pointed out that, in making their calculations, the Committee had drawn up the Shipbuilding programme on a rising scale up to a total output of 3,000,000 gross tons.With -(i)   The supply of steel increased to 20,000 tons weekly, and(ii)   17;500 additional skilled workmen, or 22,000 additional unskilled workmenthe rate of Merchant output per annum would he 1,600,000 tons gross.
(i)   The supply of steel increased to 22,500 tons weekly,and(ii)   35,000 ndditiohal skilled workmen, or 44,000 additional unskilled workmenthe rate of Merchant output per annum would &quot;be 1,800,000 tons grossWith -(i)   The supply of steel increased to 32,000 tons weekly,and(ii)   95,000 additional skilled workmen, or 120,000 additional unskilled workmen,the rate of Merchant output por rnnum would &quot;be 3,000,000 tons gross, but in this case, it would be necessary, in addition to obtaining extra men and materialj to make extensions to works.SHORTAGE OF MATERIAL.Mr. Carter stated that the bottle neck of the position to-day was not Labour or Marine Engines, but Steel.Mr. Ross and Mr. Macassey also referred to this shortage. On the Tyne, at Barrow and on the Clyde men are standing idle owing to lack of material.Mr, Rosb expressed the opinion that, while the posters of the First Lord and the First Sea Lord had   had a good effect in stimulating production, still there will be no great increase in output until&quot; the workmen see the material coming in faster than it can be used.Dr. Addison, when asked about the shortage of Steel, said that there was an immediate^, prospect of an additional 2,500 tons a week.     The mills had stated work on this increased rmount 10 days ago.     The additional 2,500 tons, if allocated to mer- . chant work, would raise the ranount to about 16,000 tons of steel per week or 1,300,000 tons of shipping per year.With regard to other means of getting more steel, the following possibilities were discussed:-(1)   ITALY.     Our commitments to Italy are terminating andconsequently in about 8 weeks&apos; time we shall gain a further 3,000 tons a week.(2)   WAR OFFICE.   Dr. Addison said the Inland Water Trans-port Department of the War Office are taking one-third as much steel as the Admiralty. It was suggested that some of these orders are unnecessary and could be reducedj   e.g. the War Office have given an enormous order for Steel to make a shelter for storing hay on the Manchester Ship Canal.     The question of the demands of the War Office will be examined by Lord Curzon.(3)   ABAT33DBMT OF SHELL PROGRAMME,   &apos; The Prime Ministerasked Lord Curzon also to consider whether, pending the termination of the Italian demand, an abatement should not be made to the extent of, say, 8,000 tons a week out of the present 28,000 tons in the shell programme.
It was stated that there are 300,000 tons of steel in U.S.A. awaiting shipment to France. The Shipping Controller suggested that the French shipments from England should he cut down hy 11,000 tons a week.   Dr. Addison pointed out that the French were dependent upon this steel to keep up their stock of nT?5&apos;an. He had told M. Thomas, however, that when the French shipments&quot;arrive from America we shall reduce the amount we are sending.Canada has 50,000 tons of steel available for shipment, some of which could he used for ship-building.Dr. Addison said that the chief source of in-creased supplies of steel lay in greater supplies of ore especially from Spain.   Last month   we received 494,000 tons from Spain but our demands amounted to 650,000 tons.The First Sea Lord, however, drew attention to the grave submarine risks in the Spanish voyage.Sir Leo Chiozza Honey said that great quantities of Steel were made in the U.3.A., but only 15% oame to the Allies.   Civilian demands, e.g. Sky scrapers, ought to be reduced.The possibility of taking steel at present allo-oat.*6&apos; to the Admiralty and using it f or l^erritant work was discussed, but it 7/as decidedThat the Admiralty should not he asked to surrender any steel, having regard to the paramount need of materials for the -f^&quot;&quot;&quot; construction of anti-submarine craft.(9)   With a view to the utriost eoonomy in the use of steel Dr. Addison laid the utmost stress on the importance of giving an&apos;instruction that all Departmental demands for steel should be made through one channel, which might be the Ministry of Munitions.jOIflGS AND BOILER PLATES. &apos;Mr. Carter reported a great shortage of forgings.   He asked that some authority should be appointed to look after this matter.(4) FRANCE.(5) CANADA.(6) MORE ORE.(7) U.S.A.(8) ADMIRALTY.Dr. Addison undertook tn appoint some one for this work, in the same way as he had a Director of Steel in Mr. Hunter.Mr. Oarter further stated that there are practically only two firms (Spencer on the Tyne and Colville in Scotland) who are rolling plates and their capacity is totally inadequate.The Third Sea Lord said that here too there must be one central authority for looking after this work and undertook to arrange for the appointment.$OUR.The Shipping Controller&apos;s programme of construction, referred to above, showed that no really substantial increase in output ca,n be made without more Labour.The question of getting men back from the Army was discussed but it was considered impossible to look for more than a few hundred fitters from this source.
Mr. Macuas^y fcaid that the first thing to do wee to get c material.     The Men were already very discontented because ot sufficient material w;:s available to enable them to work vertime, and, in some cases, even full time.     Additional men ould not be expected to come until this deficiency was emedi ed.Some unskilled labour had been imported from Ireland, but hio had resulted in trouble from the fact that the Irish were ,ot liable to compulsory service and therefore other men would ot work with them.Lord Curzon referred to previous discussions and decisions n regard to payment by results and piece work.     Ho substantial rogress has been made in this direction and the results, as far b shipbuilding is concerned, are disappointing.     A scheme ught to be introduced at once, through Parliament if need be, nd for the duration of the War.Mr, Macassey agreed that legislation in this respect was ost desirable.It was decided:-That a clause covering this question of payment by results should be inserted in the Munitions Amending Bill.APPOINTMEM1 OF AN ORGANISER OP STEEL SUPPLIES.After the members of the Shipping and Shipbuilding Committees ad left the room, the Prime Minister raised the question of ppointing someone who should be responsible for seeing that the roduction of steel for Merchant Shipbuilding was pushed on to the taost extent possible.     Someone who should go round the various oiks and hustle the manufacturers.Such methods had been applied with great success in the inistry of Munitions and had resulted in greatly increased out-at of guns and shells.The Prime Minister earnestly requested the Shipping Con-roller to make such an appointment.The Shipping Controller undertook to consider the matter.ILLUSION.To sum up, the conclusions reached were as follows:-(l)   That the demands of the War Office for steel should be examined by Lord Curzon.(2)   That shipments of steel from this country to Prance should be reduced when the French ship-ments from U.S.A. come forward.(3)   That the Admiralty should not be asked to surrender any steel.(4)   That all Departmental demands for steel shouldbe mode through one channel; namely the Ministry cf Munitions.(5)   That Dr. Addison should -appoint some authority to look after forgings.
- 5 -&amp; v -(6)   That the Third Ser. Lord should arrange for the appointment of some central authority to super-vise the manufacture of Boiler Plates.(7)   That -it is not possible to look to the Armyfor more labour, except in a very small degree.(8)   That a Clause providing for payment by resultsshould be inserted in the Munitions Amending Bill.(9) Thnt the Shipping Controller should examine the question of appointing someone to stimulate the production of ateel for Merchfmt Shipbuilding,
