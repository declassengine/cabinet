S   C R EJT. G.T.576.WAR   CABINET INTER DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.Admiralty, S.W.26th April, 1917.Sir,I enclose the Committee^ report on the matter of the proposed sale of Messrs. S. Pearson &amp; Sons&apos; Mexican Oil Interests to the Standard Oil Company y/hich was referred to the Committee by the Cabinet.If the Report is approved it might be advisable for the Cabinet to instruct the Committee to convey to the firm the Cabinet&apos;s desire that if the American Company intimate their intention pf purchasing, the Committee should at once be informed and that the suggestion in paragraph 10 of the Reportshould be acted on.I am,        Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed)     E.B. PRETYMAN.(Chairman)The Secretaryto the War Cabinet.
CONFIDENTIALff:THIS PAPER IS THH PROPERTY OP 11*11* GQVERlWm AND IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT.1,     The CoDKiitteo have had under their consideration the aostion referred to thorn by tho War Cabinet of the pr*posed transfer 7 Messrs S* Pearson &amp; Son of their interests in the Mexican Eagle ,1 Company, the Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Company and the glo Oil Transport Company to an American Company, which is undor-fcood to be the Standard Oil Company.     The question has been fully .soussed by the Committee, and Chairman has had several interviews ,t,h Lord Cowdray and tho Hon. Clive Pearson.2.      The proposed sale would nominally leave the constitution of c Companies unaffected, but it involves the transfer of 80$ of iir share capital which is equivalent to a transfer of the control, ho negotiations are stated to be well advanced, and a figure of jproximately  10,500,000 has been put forward by the firm as the iiling price of their interests.     This figure has been neither sspted nor rejected by the prospective purchasers, and while ws are .able to state the approximate sum which these interests would fetch ;&apos;tho open market, we are informed on good authority that the firm1 s ioo is considerably above that figure.The importance of Mexico as an oil producing country is great d growing, and the Companies with which the firm is associated hold oonraanding position theye. In 1916, 6,742,480 tons of til were oduced in Mexico, an amount exceeded only by tho U.S.A, (37,864,031 ns) and Russia (9,045,700 tons). To this the Eagle Oil Company had ntributed 2,000,650 tons. A large Admiralty contract ^as been for lino years in force with the Companies.4,       The question for decision is whether, and If so, under what conditions the great interests controlled by Messrs. Pearson shal.1 be allowed to pass into the hands of an American Company whioh toady controls suoh a large proportion of the world&apos;s oil supplies.5,       We are bound to point out the serious-consequences whioh *ould follow such a sale.   The transfer would leave the Standard Mid other Amdrioan Oil Companies in complete control of the toerican and Mexican oilfields which, it should be remembered, lie barest to this country with the exception of Venezuela and Trinidad. It is true that if in any future war the U,S.A. were hostile we should get no oil from America or Mexico at all.   But if the U.S.A. *S*e neutral or even an unfriendly neutral we might still obtain Jil from Mexico provided it wa3 in British ownerships   Apart from ^ political aspects of the case, if no nearer supplies of oil 4lle discovered, the commercial and industrial effeots of this saletold be very injurious, and any measures which might subsequently f taken, such as the imposition of a tariff, to free British Industry frcm foreign control in &quot;the vital matter of petroleum applies would be largely neutralised.The Committee therefore looked for some means of preventing transfer and of retaining this valuable property in British pids,%   Messrs. Pearson were asked if they would be prepared to &apos;^sfer their interests to a purely British Company or combine. lj ^ill be remembered that Lord Cowdray has recently advocated in ^pranda addressed to the Cabinet the formation of such a combine. ,e is now of opinion, however, that his firm cannot wait until acombine/
- 2 -combine is formed, as owing to the disturbed conditions in Mexico they wish to reduce their commitments there as speedily as possible.7,       Messrs. Pearson however, made a proposal which seemed to us deserving of careful consideration;    LordCcwdray verbally proposed that his fiiVs interests in the three Ocmpanies the price of which he fixed at  18,500,000 should be sold to the Government at  9,250,000,     The Government would receive interest at 5f0 on that amount and the whole of the remaining profits would be paid to the firm.   The profits of the Companies are at ^resent stated to be between  3*000,000 and  4,000,000 per annum, but roughly speaking, after interest at 5$ on the above purchase money and the dividends payable to outside shareholders had been deducted the firm!s share of the remainder would under this arrangement be  2,000,000,    He further proposed that twelve months after the conclusion of the war the firm should have an option to re-purchase the interests sold to the Government for the same sum which the Government had paid: but this arrangement would be subject to a prior counter option ca the part of the Government to acquire the firra&apos;s entire interests by paying an additional sum of  9,250,000.Lord Oowdray also said that if the Government1 s option to purchase were exercised on behalf of an Imperial Oil Combine he might be willing to leave a considerable proportion of his capital in the business.   The chronology of these options was left rather vague but the intention was that, if it were politically practicable, the Government would be able, a year after the end of the war, tc acquire the whole of Messrs. Pearson&apos;s interest in the three companies for a total sum of  18,500,000, or in the event of the firm not exercising their option the Government would become the owners cf the same interests for the original payment of  9,250,000.8,        This offer evidently required further investigation on various points of detail, e^g, the value of the firm&apos;s interests, the rate of interest to be paid on the sum advanced by the Government, etc., but before attempting to settle these points a political and financial question cf policy remained to be decided, vis, whether H.M* Government should acquire&apos; a controlling interest in a Mexican oilfield.      The point was referred to the Foreign Office and a copy of their note is attached.   As the terms of the Foreign Office note justified      further negotiations, Messrs. Pearson were asked to put forward Lord Cowdray!s verbal proposals in writing.9.        The attached correspondence shews the attitude taken by toe firm.   The proposals new piit forward differ in some degree from those verbally discussed and in so far as they differ make *he offer in our opinion much less attractive.   It is proposed ^at H.M. Government should purchase 3,975,000 shares in the various companies for a sum of  8,165?0Q0 which is practically equivalent to their present market price.   Only 5f0 interest will be paid on this sum the remainder of the profits going to the firm.   If, after the war, the firm exercise their option of re-purchase, the Government must if they wish to retain their interests, pay an additional sum of  8,165,000 to complete the purchase of these shares.,   If Messrs, Pearson re-purchase the snares they will incur no responsibility as the transaction win J3^carried through by a new company formed for the purpose, v&quot;hioh will devote half of its net profits (apart from interest J* 5$ on the sum due) towards repayment.   The Committee feel jhat they cannot recommend such a scheme to the Cabinet as ^oviding even a basis for negotiation.t.l0.      It it-is decided to accept the Committee&apos;s recommenda-&apos;VQn not to proceed further with this scheme and if the Standard fJU Company intimate their intention to purchase, the Committee &quot;kink that any transfer of Messrs. Pearson&apos;s interests shouldbe/
t;IIbe ^ade not to the Standrad Oil Company itself b^rt to one of its subsidiary Companies registered in the British Empire, suoh as the Imperial Oil Company of Canada or the Anglo-Amerioan Oil iCompany, and that the-British Government should be able direotljrIor indirectly to exercise suoh a controlling interest in the purchasing Company as to make a further transfer to non-British purchasers impossible.     These conditions would, it is hoped, secure the supply of Mexican oil and the control of tankers to the Government during the present and any future war unless the U.S.A, should be hostile.   The correspondence shows that the Committee have requested the Firm to make this a condition ofany I sale transaction concluded with the American Company.   Apart fromIthe political safeguards which we have mentioned the transfer would be open to the same economic objections whether it was made to the Standard Cil Company or to one of its subsidiary I Companies.11.      It has been suggested that the Government might without Imaking any alternative proposal prevent the sale of this great IBritish interest to a Foreign Company.   We have carefully I considered this question and think that as suoh a prohibition I would be valid only during the war, it would prevent the sale Iat a time when the transfer cf British securities would help the [exchange without securing British control after the war is over. IFurther, it is to be remembered that the Mexican Eagle Company I which is the producing Company is a Mexican Company, and it is at I least doubtful how -far the British Government would be warranted Iin preventing the sale of the shares he-li in it by British I subjects.I  12,      Since the negotiations took place the conditions have peen somewhat altered by the entry of the U.S.A. into the war land by the increasingly threatening political situation in Mexico, pe Committee feel that we are now less dependent upon Mexican I sources for our supplies of oil for war purposes and also that lit is less desirable than ever to risk money in any purchase or Iguarantee suoh as that suggested by Messrs. Pearson.     Also any Ipurchase by the Amerioan Company seems improbable under present. Iconditions in Mexico, and so far as the Committee are able to rjudge it is mainly owing to the risk entailed by the conditions Ithat Messrs. Pearson desire to sell.   If therefore they cannot Isell now it is by no moans certain that they will still wish to Iseli after the war.     The Committee do not therefore advise any IGovernment action beyond that suggested in -paragraph 10 above but Idevelopments will be watched and a further report submitted if [thought necessary.(Signed) E,G.

VERY CONFIDENTIALTHIS PAPER IS THE PROPERTY OF H.M. GOVERNMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT.PI REIGN OFFICE MEMORANDUM fN BRITISH OIL INTERESTS IN MEXICO.The alternatives&apos; reviewed by the Inter-Departmental Committee fall broadly under two headings1.        The transfer, in whole or in part, of Lord Ocwdray&apos;e shares to an American Company, or, subject to oertain conditions to a subsidiarjr company of the latter, regisA.ered in the British Empire.2. The transfer as a temporary measure and pending the formation of a British Combine, of a controlling interest in Lord Cowdray&apos;s shares to the British Government.As regards (1), the Foreign Office has only to observe --hat, by divesting Lord CowdrayTs interests of their British character and causing them, by the proposed transfer, to assume wholly or in part an American character, the security 0f the oil wells would be to that extent impaired.   The animus in Mexico against all things American is profound and certainly is not decreasing, whereas British enterprises in that country enjoy a relative popularity cr at least toleration.As regards (2), the Foreign Office &apos;Ust call attention to the danger cf the Americans invoking the Monroe doctrine, or appealing to the principle laid down by the so-called &quot;Lodge re solution11 of the United States Senate of August 2nd, 1912, in the event of its becoming known that the British Government had become the permanent owners of a large proportion of the shares of the Mexican Oil Companies.    This resolution is directed against the ownership by a non-American Power of any property on the American Continent capable of being used as a base for the interruption of the United States lines of communication. The text is as follows:-11 That when any harbour cr other place in the American Continents is so situated that the occupation thereof for Naval or Military purposes might -threaten the com,mnioations or the safety of the United States, the Government of the United States could.net see with-out grave concern the possession of such harbour or oilier place by any corporation or association which has such a relation tc another Government, not American, as tc give that Government practical power cr control for Naval and Military purposes&quot;.  -The Foreign1Office would not regard the temporary holding by the British Government of a portion of Lord Cowdray^s shares , pending the conclusion of arrangements tc pass them en to a British Combine, as open to the same objections as the permanent acquisition of such shares by the British Government. If such a provisional settlement is deemed essential on naval and economic grounds, and if it cannot be conveniently avoided owing tc existing financial conditions, the Foreign Office would net, as at^preseni. advised, oppose its adoption.- M. de B.%i Office, foh 26th, 1917

(Iutd.)     B..C.. P.
April 3rd 1917Dear Mr, Pearson,I have now had time to study the proposals in the detailed scheme you sent me, and as now set out it does not appear to ne to he at all attractive to His Majesty1 s Government.It is suggested that His Majesty1^ Government shall advance over  0,000,000 at the low rate of interest of 5$, and that their only security for re-payment after the option date shall he a moiety of the profits of the undertaking for which S,P, &amp; S, will no longer he responsible.S.P. &amp; S. on the other hand obtain a cash payment of over  8,000,000 whioh they will never have to repay except by surrendmg a moiety of the profits of the companies, less the &amp;% interest, and there is no limit to the period over which this payment may thus be automatically spread.     I certainly did not understand that this was what was meant by repayment;   and it appears obvious that S.P. &amp; S. must in any case.exercise their option, whatever may be- the condition of the propertyafter the War, as., they incur no liability by doing so.This means that His Majesty^ Government can only secure the retention of British control by exercising their own counter opinion which involves paying for the shares again, and unless by that time their market value has doubled they could only be taken up by an Imperial Oil Co.   at a serious loss, to the Crown whioh would have to forfeit the difference between the double value paid, and the then market value.I could not ask the Treasury to assent to such a proposal nor could it be defended in Parliament, so that unless its main features are very considerably modified, it seems useless to discuss details, and I must meantime ask yon to make any 6ale to American purchasers conditional on their purchasing-by means of a subsidiary company registered within the Empire, as suggested in my former letter.Yours very truly,(Sgd), E..

We know their value, we are assured and we ful3ybelieve they will produce a net income of not less than  3,000,000 a year although the properties are n6t as yet above half developed.     After 16 years of sawing, during 13 of which we received no dividend on the Ordinary shares of the Mexican Eagle Oil Company, the harvest now to be reaped is naturally a very substantial one,(b) The Company should pay 40$ dividends and place  1,000,000 a j.rear to reserve,     I may say this prosperity is only reasonable and usual from such proved properties as we possess,(c) As an evidence of our belief in the. properties I may add that some 4 years ago we bought from the market shares costing us on the average some 46/- a share, to the valueof approximately  POO,000,(d) We have not submitted to you any facts or figures showing our valuation of the shares; our under standing has been that when yon agreed to the general principled of the scheme and a minimum price we should then have presented our figures and we are satisfied that in the course of discussion with you on the subject of values we should have be-n able to prove that our valuation is an eminently fair and reasonable one,9.-    I trust the foregoing elaboration Will make clear the intention-s of our scheme.
