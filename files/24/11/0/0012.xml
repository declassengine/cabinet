Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.51MINUTES AND  MEMORANDAON MATTERS AFFECTINGALCOHOL  SUPPLIES.THE Cabinet has before it certain memoranda by Major Waldorf Astor (Nos. G. 143 and 144) relating to the use of spirits from bond for munition and other purposes.Action has been taken by the Ministry, in accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet, on the subject of the use of grain in distilleries for the production of acetone and spirit. The general position is as shown in these papers. It will be observed that considerations as to the production and use of yeast and baking powder are involved, as well as important financial considerations. At the present time we are not obtaining any spirit from distilleries using grain, other than those concerned in the production of yeast.C. A.April 16, 1917.Ministry of Munitions of War, April 1917.
MINUTES AND MEMORANDUM ON; ALCOHOL SUPPLIES.Minute 1.Sir Frederic Nathan.I HAVE not yet received a Report as to the proceedings and recommendations of the Committee on Alcohol Supplies. I am particularly anxious to know what progress is being made. It is quite evident, in view of the shortages of shipping and our need for spirit, that the possibility of making use of existing stocks will have to be more thoroughly explored. Will you please let me have a Report on this matter as soon as possible ?February 20, 1917. C. ADDISON.Minute 2.The Minister.The Committee was appointed in December 1916 to consider the requirements and supplies of alcohol for munitions and other purposes, and to advise how the deficiency of available supplies, which it seemed at that time would very shortly make itself felt, could be made good.Since then it has been ascertained that the recovery of ether-alcohol solvent used in the manufacture of R.D.B. is possible to a considerable extent, and that the outpub of the patent still distilleries would be able to meet all demands with little, if any, extra production.The situation has undergone, however, quite recently a complete change owing to the necessity o conserving tonnage, and a further meeting of the Committee has been postponed until the policy to be pursued has been considered.The estimated monthly consumption of spirit is approximately as follows : Propellants T.N.T. purification Acetone (Orosfield&apos;s)      ...Transport services Industrial trade (70 per cent, war Chemists and druggists ... Rectifiers (gin) ...Bulk gallons Proof gallonsTable (A).services)1,025,550 60,200 26,5001,112,250 20,000 450,000 117,500 106,2501,806,000 3,010,000At the.present time the patent still.distilleries are working as follows : 16 in the production of alcohol and yeast from grain. 7 in the production of alcohol from grain. 5 in the production of alcohol from molasses. 2 in the production of acetone from grain.And there is also the King&apos;s Lynn factory making acetone from grain. Of the seven now. producing alcohol from,, grain, four are being adapted for the manufacture of acetone. The monthly producing capacity of these distilleries and the quantities of grain and molasses required are estimated to be as follows : &apos;Table (B).Nature of Distillery.	Production.

The quantities of grain consumed in any given distillery will be about the same whether it is producing alcohol or acetone.Until some decision has been arrived at as to the actual requirements of yeast and how they are to be met, ic does not seem possible to touch the question of yeast-producing distilleries.The stoppage of the non-yeast distilleries using grain, including the two now starting to make acetone and the four now being adapted for acetone manufacture, but which are at present making spirit, would probably effect a saving of 7,560 tons of grain a month.If the distilleries producing spirit from molasses were shut down also, about 5,250 tons per month of tank-steamer tonnage would be set free.The closing of all the non-yeast grain and the molasses distilleries would bring the alcohol production down to about 2^ to 2^ million proof gallons per month, which is the output of the yeast distilleries, and it might be necessary in order to meet the requirements for spirit amounting, as stated above, to about 3,000,000 proof gallons a month, to give notice and make the necessary arrangements to draw on the spirit in bond and distil it. If, however, the molasses distilleries are allowed to continue, the necessity just referred to would not arise for a few months and the cost of spirit would not become too prohibitive to trie industrial trade, which uses molasses spirit&apos; almost entirely.It seems obvious, in fairness to the non-yeast patent-still distilleries that if they are stopped, all distilleries using grain, except those where yeast is made, should cease work, including the Scotch and Irish pot as well as patent stills. This might possibly cause trouble in Scotland, and would most certainly do so in Ireland.Closing down grain distilleries would cause some reduction in the output of cattle feeding stuff.The Scotch and Irish pot-still distilleries have been licensed to make 5,717,320 and 2,804,044 proof gallons of spirit this season, and have probably completed about two-thirds of these quantities.If distilling is restricted or reduced by the closing of non-yeast distilleries or other action that may be taken, the first trade to feel the shortage will be the gin trade, and the export trade in gin particularly.Then it is a question whether the export of whisky should be allowed, as the stock of spirit in bond forming this country&apos;s reserve, is thereby reduced. On the other hand, the export trade in whisky and gin is of value on account of the high prices obtained from abroad for products of comparatively low cost.It certainly appears as if the distribution of alcohol, whether newly manufactured or taken from the stocks of whisky and rum in bond, will have to come under Govern-ment control. The distribution of restricted supplies of spirit to the essential industrial trades will be a matter of some difficulty, and this difficulty will increase if the industrial trades have to be supplied with alcohol redistilled from spirit taken from bonded stocks.When the policy to be pursued has been settled, the Advisory Committee on Alcohol Supplies could consider and report on these and any other matters necessary to carry it out.As regards acetone requirements, these have been considerably reduced owing to the increased turnover to R.D.S., and the situation has been further relieved quite recently by the placing of a contract in America with W. S. Gray and Co. for 2,500 tons at 22^ cents per lb., say 1061 per ton f.o.b. New York. Negotiations are also in progress for considerably increasing the production of the Industrial Alcohol Company, of Baltimore. In view of this and of the fact that the production&apos; of acetone in the distilleries is likely to be uncertain for some time yet and undoubtedly very expensive, there seems to be no justification for continuing its manufacture there. The conversions, however, are so far advanced that it would!be desirable to complete them in case it might be necessary to revert to them later.F. NATHAN, D.P.S. (E).February 22, 1917.   .

ADDISON.February 22, 1917.Minute 4.Sir Worthington Evans.The action taken on the Ministers minutes of the 22nd February, and the information therein asked for is as follows: (A.) Stoppage of Non-yeast Distilleries.The following distilleries have been closed down : Under 2. The Distilleries Company (Limited) : Kirkliston Distillery. The Yoker Distillery Company (Limited): Yoker Distillery. William Dunville and Co. (Limited): Belfast Distillery.Under 3. The North British Distillery Company (Limited), Edinburgh Distillery. Messrs.

(Limited), Three Mills Distillery.
(BJ-Continuing Distillation at His Majesty s Factory, Kings Lynn.The Superintendent, His- Majesty&apos;s Factory, King&apos;s Lynn, has been instructed in the terms of the Ministers minute.(C.) The Molasses Position.(a.) The stocks of molasses actually at the distilleries are about 5,400 tons. (b.) Molasses are used in conjunction with other materials for cattle feeding, (c) The residues, after distillation, have no practical use.(d.) Molasses tank steamers could be used for the conveyance of petrol, lubricating oils, or other liquid cargoes.A memorandum marked (A) is attached, dealing with the use of molasses for the manufacture of spirit for war services and the industrial trade. The points are briefly as follows: 53,000 tons of molasses a year have been used by the distilleries on the averageof the last six years. 60,000 tons at least are required this year.36,000 tons are produced annually in the sugar refineries on the last six years&apos;average, of which about three-quarters were used for cattle feeding, andabout one-quarter by the distilleries. 124,600 tons have been imported annually on the average of the last six years, ofwhich approximately one-third went to the distilleries, and the remainingtwo-thirds to cattle feeding. 89,000 tons have been contracted for up to the end of this year, of which 47,000tons have been sold to distilleries and 42,000 tons for cattle feeding.Five specially fitted tank steamers, having a total capacity of 18,000 tons are engaged in the trade between this country and Cuba. These-steamers could be used for petrol, &amp;c, but are not suitable for food-carrying purposes.As a source of alcohol, molasses are cheaper, more easily transported, and more readily and quickly discharged than grain. The process of manufacture is more expeditious, and produces a cheap spirit for industrial purposes.I recommend that steps be taken to ensure the continuance in this service of the five steamers which are of no use as food carriers, so as to ensure the maximum output of alcohol from molasses.(D.) Continuing Distillation at Yeast Distilleries. Noted.(E.)-Pot-still Output.The quantity of spirit licensed to be made this season in the pot-still distilleries is 8,521,364 proof gallons, Of this quantity about 3,074,000 proof gallons were still outstanding on the 26th February, requiring about 150,000 quarters of barley; of this, however, a considerable quantity has already been malted.The periods (weeks) to be worked by the pot-still distilleries from the 26th February were as follows : 46 distilleries had completed the licensed quantity. &apos;36 had from one to five weeks to work. 26 had from six to nine weeks to work. 43 will still be working after April.The figures on the 26th February for Scotland and Ireland were as follows : Scotland.  89 distilleries working ; 2,043,000 proof gallons still to be produced. Ireland. 16 distilleries working ; 1,031,000 proof gallons still to be produced.To close down the pot-still distilleries now would certainly cause serious trouble with the distillers, more especially the Irish ones, and the actual saving of grain would not amount to much. This latter point is dealt with by Lord Devonport in a letter to Major Astor,: dated the 8th March, as follows : [486]    .- C
&quot; It should be remembered that the quantitly of grain that would be saved is comparatively small, representing to-day about 17,000 tons of barley, the greater portion of which has already been malted and is so lost for either malting or feeding purposes.&quot;It is not likely, however, that licences will be granted to the pot-still distillers for next season. ^his being so, it is desirable that the Board of Agriculture and the Food Controller be advised, in order that steps may be taken to see that those who have been in the habit of growing barley in the country for potable spirit making, continue to grow barley next season for food purposes.(F.) Alcohol in Bond.The quantity of 1916 and 1917 spirits in bond at distilleries and warehouses after deducting for evaporation, &amp;c, may be taken as 30,000.000 gallons.At present market prices, the spirits in bond are worth on an average about 20s. an original proof gallon. The newer spirit would probably work out at a somewhat lower average figure, say 16s. a proof gallon.The question of using this spirit for munition purposes, and of placing some of it at the disposal of the patent still distillers, is dealt with in a memorandum attached, marked (B).The considerations against taking bonded spirits for munitions purposes may be summarised as follows : The high prices of these spirits.The fact that these&quot; high-priced spirits are very largely held by merchants and blenders, to whom the banks are in the habit of advancing large sums either by discounting their bills or giving them loans on the security of these stocks.The commandeering of any of this spirit by the Government at much below the market price wold cause a panic in the trade, and probably a financial crisis, the amount of money involved being considerably over 100,000,0001. at present market prices.The political effect of such action.The permanent damage to the trade, both home and export, owing to the effect the withdrawal would have on proper blending of patent and pot-still spirit, on which the reputation of Scottish and Irish whiskey has been built up.Instead of compensating holders of patent-still spirit by placing a certain quantity of pot-still spirit at their disposal, it would be easier and cause less friction to take the pot-still whiskey for munitions purposes, instead of a corresponding quantity of patent-still whiskey.(G.) Acetone Position.The stocks, requirements, and prospective supplies of acetone for the four months ending the 30th June, 1917, are given in Appendix.*piss.;- No output is included in this table from any of the distilleries, nor from the Royal Naval Cordite Factory, nor are the prospective further supplies from the Industrial Alcohol Company, of Baltimore, taken into account.Note. It is understood that the Royal Naval Cordite Factory will be producing 20 tons a month from June, 1917, onwards sufficient for its requirements. ,      The estimated quantity of rice wanted during 1917 is 20,000 tons.The summary of these figures is as follows :--Tons.. Stock on the 1st March, 1917 ... ... ... ... ...    1,100Prospective supplies based on orders, less 20 per cent.   ... ... ...     4,703Total ...        ... ... ... ... ...    5,803Estimated requirements      ...        ...        ... ... ... ...    5,078Estimated stock on the 30th June, 1917 ... ... ... ...      725(H.) The Position of Construction Worh at Acetone Distilleries.The work still to be carried out to complete the six distilleries which were being adapted for the manufacture of acetone is inconsiderable, but, such as it is, it has been* See &quot; Acetone Requirements and Supplies, February-June, 1917,&quot; p. 14,
(a.) Reduction of the Proportion of Yeast used in Bread-making.Information obtained from various sources shows that there is a great variation in the practice as regards the quantity of yeast used to a sack of flour. The quantities vary from as low as \ lb. a sack to as high as 3 lb. a sack.These figures, however, do not necessarily imply that \ lb. per sack would be sufficient all round, nor that all bread requires 3 lb. of yeast per sack to produce it.Bread is made by bakers, whose consumption of flour varies from say ten sacks a week to many hundreds a week, but in addition to the bread produced in the bakeries, very large quantities are home-baked, particularly in the Midlands and the North of England; and whereas the big bakers could. .and probably do, use from If to 1^ lb. or even less of yeast per sack, the smaller bakers very likely use more. In the case of home-baked bread, the quantity of yeast per sack of flour may, on account of wastage, be very much higher even than the 3 lb. referred to above. It is also considered that the new standard flower requires more yeast.To attempt therefore to reduce the gross output of yeast and arbitrarily to limit the quantity to be used per sack of flour would be a course which could not be undertaken without a very thorough investigation of its practicability, and the working out of a system of distribution. Any precipitate action to curtail the supplies of yeast would create serious inconvenience and widespread dissatisfaction.The Royal Society Food (War) Committee has recently stated that the pre-war consumption of flour for bread-making was 25,500,000 sacks a year, but there is evidence that the recent consumption of bread has been ,on the increase, and that this increase has been very marked during the last few weeks. There is no doubt that, the supply of meat having been reduced, and potatoes being scarce, the poorer classes are eating more bread.suspended as far as it has been possible to do so. The only large items of plant to be delivered and erected are five wash backs and six inoculant tanks ; enquiries are being made to ascertain whether these vessels cannot be used for alcohol or acid storage, or partly for one and partly for the other.(I.) Baking-Powder.A ton of acid phosphate baking-powder requires a ton of dearsenicated sulphuric acid, and a ton of phosphate rock for its manufacture.The present home production of acid phosphate is probably not more than 20 tons a week, and there is no plant existing to increase this output. A memorandum (G) is attached dealing with the nature and production of baking-powders. The points are briefly as follows : Baking-powders are used for fancy baking only at present.One of the essential constituents is cream of tartar, but owing to its present scarcity, acid phosphate is being used to replace it to a certain extent.It might be possible to use baking-powder for household bread-making, but the quality of the bread would not be satisfactory, the cost per sack of flour would be about 4s. as against about Is. id,, or less for yeast, and no plant exists for increasing the present output of acid phosphate, nor for dearsenicatiug the quantities of sulphuric acid required; moreover phosphate rock is scarce. On the present consumption of yeast, approximately 1,500 tons of acid phosphate, requiring for its manfacture 1,500 tons of phosphate rock, and 1,500 tons of dearsenicated sulphuric acid would be wanted.The Yeast Question.By closing down the non-yeast distilleries, a certain saving in tonnage has been effected, but the continuance of distilling in the yeast-producing distilleries still necessitates a very large import of grain into this country.It has been shown in section I above, that baking-powder cannot be substituted for distillers&apos; yeast, and the only courses that appear open by which a saving in the imports of grain now required for yeast production can be effected are (a.) Reduction of the production of yeast used in bread-making. (b.) The use of substitutes, other than baking-powder for yeast.
If the Royal Society Committees figure of 25,500,000 sacks is taken, and the amount of yeast required calculated, the following data are obtained : 11 lb. of yeast per sack of flour = 342 tons of yeast per week. 2&quot; lb.      ,,        ,,        ,,      = 456        ,, ,,2  lb. ,, ,, ,, =570 3 lb.     ,,        ,,        ,,      =684If, on the other hand, the output of yeast, which is about 700 tons weekly, is taken as a basis, then: li lb. of yeast per sack of flour = 49,000,000 sacks of flour. 2 lb.      ,, ,, ,,      = 39,000,00021 lb.      ,, ,, ,,      = 34,250,0003 lb.     ,,        ,,        ,,      = 29,500,000The yeast figure, if taken at the high average of 3 lb. per sack, would indicate a consumption of flour approximately of the same order as that given by the Royal Society, but it has already been shown that the quantity of bread now being consumed is likely to correspond to a considerably higher quantity of flour than that estimated by the Royal Society, so that the average quantity of yeast used, based on the present yeast production, is probably lower than 3 lb. per sack of flour.These considerations point to the conclusion that no great reduction is possible in the quantity of yeast required for bread making in this country, at all events, until the matter has been thoroughly investigated, and it follows therefore that a decrease in the quantity of grain required cannot be looked for at an early date.There is, moreover, another and very important reason for not further reducing the quantity of groin used for the production of alcohol, and that is that the draff, or spent grain, obtained from the distilleries in large quantities is a cheap cattle food.(b.) The use of Substitutes, other than Baking-Powder, for Yeast.In the north it is the practice of the smaller bakers to prepare their own yeast. This is effected by inoculating a mixture of flour, malt, and, in some cases, hops, with a quantity of the product of a previous operation. For this purpose a certain amount of additional plant of a simple character would be required, but the chief difficulty would be that greater skill would be necessary to work the process and, on account of the extra supervision required, more men would have to be employed. The same objection would apply to the adoption of other leavens depending on living organisms for their action.Sources of further Supplies of Spirits.If it is agreed that there can be no reduction in the manufacture of yeast, this is a further reason against taking potable spirit out of bond, because the spirits necessarily produced at the yeast distilleries, supplemented by the spirit from molasses, will probably meet present requirements for war and industrial purposes.It is not likely, however, that there will be any appreciable margin, and it will be desirable, therefore, to supplement the supplies by increasing the output of spirits from the molasses distilleries, which can be easily done if the import of molasses is increased, as referred to in Section (D), and by importing spirit from the West Indies.Owing to the stoppage of the importation of rum, West Indian distilleries are idle, and could produce plain spirit of varying strengths to the extent of about 500,000 proof gallons a month.As the United States and Canada are the only sources of supply of acetone, and as these supplies are only just sufficient to cover requirements, a shortage may arise at any time. Further, it has to be borne in mind that, when the Henbury and Irvine nitro-cellulose factories commence work, very large additional quantities of spirit will be required. It would therefore be very desirable to take- steps at once to secure the supplies of spirit from the West Indies, and full enquiries are now being made in this connection, and as to the possibilities of obtaining spirit from other British colonies and dependencies.From the point of view of freight the figures are as follows : The space required for 50 o.p. spirit the average strength of West Indian spirit  equivalent to 1 ton of 66 o.p. spirit, the strength required for explosive manufacture, is 86^ cubic feet.The space required for grain to produce 1 ton of 66 o.p. spirit is 200 cubic feet, or approximately two and a quarter times as great.
Summary and Recommendations.I. The estimated present requirements of solvents for war and industrial purposesare as follows : Acetone .... ... ... ... ...        1,270 tons per month.Alcohol  ...     -  ... ... ... 3,010,000 proof gallons per month,2. The prospective supplies of acetone from Canada and the United States, together with the small quantities produced in this country, will just about cover requirements.3. The alcohol produced in the yeast distilleries, and in the patent-still distilleries using molasses, will be sufficient at present.4. To meet possible shortages of supplies of acetone, and any increases in the requirements of alcohol, the output of alcohol from molasses could be increased by about 500,000 proof gallons a month, by importing more molasses, and by using some of the molasses now being converted into cattle food ; and, in addition, supplies of alcohol could be obtained from the West Indies, which are capable- of producing (now that the manufacture of rum is stopped) the equivalent of 500,000 gallons of 66 o.p. spirit a month. The tonnage for grain to produce 1 ton of 66 o.p. spirit is about two and a quarter times as much as that required for 1 ton of the spirit.5. To make the position absolutely safe it is recommended that both these ways of increasing the available supplies of spirit be sanctioned.6. The closing down of the nine non-yeast patent-still distilleries, six of which were to make acetone, will reduce the quantity of grain to be imported by some 12,000 tons a month, on the assumption that all nine would be fully working.7. A further reduction in the quality of imported grain could be effected if the manufacture of gin, mainly for export purposes, be stopped, and if the balance of the potable spirit still to be made on this season&apos;s licences be cancelled.8. The saving in the former case would be approximately 2,000 tons a month ; in the latter case the saving would be about 17,000 tons of barley.9. It is not recommended that either of these steps be taken, because, in the first case, it would not be worth while interfering with an important export trade for such a small saving of grain, and in the second case because the quantity of grain involved is inconsiderable, and most of it, being malted, is of no use for either milling or feeding purposes Moreover, stopping the pot still distilleries would probably give rise to serious political agitation, particularly in the case of the Irish distilleries.10. As it is unlikely that pot-still whiskey will be allowed to be made next season, steps should be taken by the Board of Agriculture and the Food Controller to see that the same quantity of barley is grown for food purposes.II. From 23,000 to 24,000 tons of grain are required monthly by the yeast distilleries, from which are produced approximately 2,500,000 gallons of proof spirit, and probably some 700 tons of yeast.12. It has been suggested that instead of making spirit it might be obtained by withdrawing young spirit from bond and bringing it up to the required strength. For the reasons given in section (F) of this minute, this course is not recommended except as.a very last resource.!3. Stopping the manufacture of spirit would mean the stoppage of the supplies of yeast for bread makimg, for which it would not be possible to provide baking-powder substitutes. Some reduction might, however, be made in the consumption of yeast. This is a matter, however, which would require very careful consideration before any action is taken. Any reduction in the output of spirit would mean a corresponding reduction in the quantity of cattle-feeding stuff available. These questions are dealt with in greater detail in that portion of this minute headed, &quot; The Yeast Question.&quot;It i^ recommended that for the present no reduction be made in the output of spirit and yeast from the yeast distilleries, but that the question of the possibility of reducing the consumption of yeast be taken up.F.

. Minute 5.The Minister.This is a very able and interesting statement of the position.I think recommendations 4 and 5 should be adopted, and if adopted subject to provision for.yeast, grain distilling might ultimately be further reduced.The possibility of increasing the yeast supply by inoculating a mixture of flour, &amp;c, with the product of a previous ojDeration, described on p. 8 of the above minute, might be investigated, and if practical a central plant might be set up.I agree with the rest of the recommendations.L. W ORTHINGTON EVANS.March 14, 1917.Minute 6.Mr. Piggott.I agree with the recommendations 4 and 5, and in general with others.These papers and the memoranda are of such importance that some of them should be printed for special use.in particular, when that has been done, I will arrange for thorough scientific inquiry on our behalf into (a.) Whether a reduced quantity of yeast cannot be made to suffice.(b.) What alternative methods of yeast production- might be adopted with aresulting economy in grain if the spirit required can be obtained otherwise,e.g,, from the West Indies, Russia, or other places.Please get printed minutes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with memoranda (A), (B), and (C), and then return thjs through Sir L. Worthington Evans to Sir F. Nathan.C. ADDIS ON.April 5, 1917
(95/A/620.) -Memorandum on the use of Molasses for the Manufacture of Spirit for War Servicesand the Industrial Trade.The quantity of molasses, home produced and imported, used for distilling, has averaged during the last six years about 53,000 tons a year. It is estimated that about 60,000 tons are required in the current year for the same purpose, although the capacity of the molasses distilleries would enable them, if working at full output, to absorb double this quantity.The production of molasses from imported raw sugar in the United Kingdom sugar refineries during the last six years averages roughly about 36,000 tons per year, but about three-quarters of this quantity has gone for feeding stock.The average annual quantity of molasses imported is about 124,600 tons over the same period, of which roughly one-third was for the distilleries and two-thirds for cattle feeding.During the last six years about two-thirds of the total quantity of molasses, home produced and imported, has been used for feeding stock, and &quot;one-third for distilling.The molasses imported into Great Britain comes principally from Cuba, and is brought over in tank steamers specially fitted for the purpose. The steamers at present in the service are : Tons.Delniira   ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...    5,000Ixia StagManx Isles Beechwood2,500 2,500 4,000 4,000These steamers would transport petrol or oils, but would not be suitable for carrying foodstuffs.It is understood the quantities due to arrive against contracts placed here with suppliers in Cuba are : Tons.From the 1st March to the 30th June, 1.917    ... ... ... ...   34,000From the 1st July to the 31st December, 1917 ... ... ... ...   55,000Of the above quantities about 47,000 tons have been sold to distillers, and 42,000 ,,       for stock feeding.If the importation of molasses is restricted in any way the benefit of these contracts, which are advantageous ones, will be lost.Molasses is the easiest and cheapest means of producing alcohol. It is really a waste product, and comparatively cheap. It is easily transported by tank steamers, quickly discharged from them by pumping, and the process of manufacture in the distillery is more expeditious than when grain is the raw material. When alcohol is required for industrial purposes, the use of molasses to a great extent would obviate the use of grain, although in manufacture from the latter the draff is available for cattle feeding, while in the production from molasses the liquid residue is of no value except, perhaps, for fertilising a use which it would not pay to adopt, owing to its bulk and consequent transport difficulties.The actual quantity of molasses required for providing a reliable supply of alcohol to the end of 1917, providing the home supply was taken for alcohol, is only about 50,000-60,000 tons at most, and the &quot; Delmira&quot; and &quot; Beechwood&quot; would probably be able to bring this quantity. At the same time it would be hard to justify the taking off of any of these steamers from the molasses trade and the cancelment of contracts, while, as the Board of Agriculture recently observed, valuable tank steamers were bringing over petrol which was being used for pleasure purposes. Any restriction on the importation of molasses would react heavily on the industrial trades of the country by increasing the cost of spirit for industrial purposes out of all proportion to its present price, and reducing considerably the quantity available. It must be borne in mind that spirit in one form or another is an essential element in a very large number of manufactures.[486]EMemorandum (A).
Memorandum (B).(95/A/620.)--Memorandum with regard to taking part of the Present Stock of Spirit in Bond forMunition Purposes.The present price of whiskey nine months old is about 16s. per original proof gallon, and the price of three-year old whiskey is over 20s., probably about 24s., per original proof gallon. The prices have been rising for some considerable time, and may vary within fairly wide limits. In the market for whiskeys with age there is now little difference in the price of malt whiskey and grain whiskey, the age and scarcity, present and prospective, of whiskey generally being the main factor in the price, not the special kind of whiskey.On the 31st January, 1917, according to a statement in the House of Commons, the cpiantities of spirits in bond were : Proof Gallons.Eome-made spirits      .. .. .. .- .. ..    138,539,000Foreign spirits Brandy     .. .. .. .. .. .. - -       3,820,000Rum (including imitation rum) .. .. .. ..     13,115,000All other sorts       .. .. .. .. ..        -..      1,593,000Total        .. .. .. .. 157,067,000The quantity of home-made spirit would be subject to a deduction of perhaps about 10 per cent, for loss by evaporation. The home spirit is nearly all bonded at about 11 o.p. for Scotland and. 25 o.p. for Ireland, and so would require to be redistilled to be available for munitions purposes. -At the present market prices the home-made spirits in bond would on an average be worth somewhere about 20s. per original proof gallon, which is enormously above the original cost of the whiskey when it was made. This increase in price has been caused to a very great extent by the Immature Spirits&apos; Act, which now requires whiskey to be kept for three years before being used, and the consequent fears of prospective scarcity, which have been further enhanced by the restriction in make of potable spirits on account of the large quantities of spirit taken for munitions.The whiskeys in bond are held partly by the distilller, but to a very much larger extent by the merchant or blender, and in many cases they have probably been sold and resold several times at, under recent circumstances, considerably increasing prices.The banks have been in the habit of advancing large sums to the blenders and merchants by discounting their bills or by giving them loans on the security of their stocks, and have therefore a very material interest in the matter.If any of the spirit bonded during 1916 were commandeered by the Government at much below the market price, the fact of its being taken would cause a slump in the market value of the whole stock in bond, and would probably cause a panic in the trade, and probably a monetary crisis, the amount of money involved being considerably over 100,000,OOOL at present market prices. This is the opinion of the general manager of one of the largest Scottish banks.Though of course very many of the holders have not paid the present market price, some of them have paid it, and all of them probably regard the whiskey as representing somewhere about what they could get for it in the market.If the whiskey in bond were commandeered by the Government at a low price, it would be a great hardship on those who had purchased it at or near the present prices, as they would have to stand the whole of the loss. The previous holders would probably have realised a handsome profit, on which they would have to pay excess profit tax, while the Government would not only be taking the spirit at a low price, but taking excess tax on it also, which would be manifestly unfair. If the Government bought the whiskey at the market price, they would get a considerable amount of excess profit tax; but even deducting excess excess profit and income tax, the price would be much above what they are at present paying.There would undoubtedly be a very strong feeling against the injustice inflicted on the individual by commandeering his stock at much below its market price, and in Ireland certainly, and perhaps also in Scotland, very strong political action would be taken, the interests being more widespread and the values much greater than even those involved in the closing down of the distilleries.
The reputation of Scotch whiskey especially has been built up on the careful maturing and blending together of grain and malt whiskeys, and to take away any large proportion of the stocks in bond might cause serious permanent damage to the trade at home and abroad.The quantity of alcohol required can be got so much more easily and so much more cheaply in other ways that it seems most undesirable, unless in case of grave extremity, to run the risk of causing a serious financial crisis in the trade, and of damaging an important national industry.With regard to the suggestion of compensating the owner of the stock in bond commandeered by the Government by giving him some of the pot-still product which is still being produced it would certainly be some partial compensation if the holder of the stock in bond received an equal quantity of pot-still whiskey ; but it would be easier, and cause less friction and trouble, if the pot-still whiskey which was taken for this purpose were itself redistilled and the bonded stock left.Memorandum (C).(9/A/620.) -Memorandum dealing with the Nature and Production of Baking-Powders.Before the outbreak of war, baking-powders generally consisted of a mixture of cream of tartar, tartaric acid, bi-carbonate of soda, and some base material, such as rice-flour. The supplies of cream of tartar and tartaric acid were obtained from Argol, which is a by-product of the wine industry, and consequently the supply of these substances is very limited. Recently various forms of acid phosphate have been used to replace cream of tartar in baking-powders.The possibility of using baking-powder as a substitute for yeast would therefore depend upon the suitability of these acid phosphates for the purpose, and upon the supply of these substances which can be obtained.Up to the present time, although baking-powder is largely used in making pastries, cakes, &amp;c, it has not been used in the preparation of household bread.Two types of acid phosphate are used: the acid phosphate, of sodium and an acid calcium phosphate. The latter is apparently&quot; quite unsuitable for the purpose, but it is claimed by one firm that an acid sodium phosphate can be prepared which can be used as a satisfactory substitute for cream of tartar or tartaric acid.There appears to be no doubt that bread can be made with acid phosphate baking-powders, but the quality is not likely to commend itself to the public.The quantities of the baking-powder ingredients required of this type are as follows : 5 lb. acid phosphate to a sack of flour.3 lb. bi-carbonate of soda to a sack of flour.At present prices this would represent a cost of 4s. per sack as against 1 s. Ad. per sack in the case of yeast used in the proportion of 2^- lb. to the sack.To replace the present consumption of yeast by acid phosphate baking-powder, a quantity of about 1,500 tons of acid phosphate per week would be required. This for its manufacture would require 1,500 tons per week of phosphate rock and 1,500 tons per week of dearsenicated sulphuric acid.The present production of acid phosphate in the country is probably not more than 20 tons per week. To increase this to the quantity required to replace yeast for bread-making would necessitate the provision of large new plants for the manufacture of the acid phosphate, additional plant for the manufacture and dearsenication of sulphuric acid, and a large supply of phosphate rock of which there is already a scarcity. Under present conditions, the new plant required could hardly be available for many months, even if it were found possible to undertake its erection, and it would be difficult or impossible to obtain the supply of phosphate rock.
