Printed for the use of the Cabinef.   April 1917.CONFIDENTIAL,THE programme of increased production of cereals and potatoes in England and Wales for the harvest of 1918 is submitted to the War Cabinet.This programme presents a complete scheme of both produce raised and the requirements for its production, and shows in broad outline the essential and inter-dependent facts upon which the Cabinet would have to base their general decision.This scheme cannot be dealt with piecemeal. It must be either accepted or rejected as a whole. The necessity of this proviso applies especially to the case of essential factors, such as labour, horses, and machinery. &quot;Unless this is clearly realised, and, in the event of their approval, the decisions of the Cabinet are, conveyed to all the Departments concerned for their prqm.pt&apos; and full observance, it would be both unwise and. uneconomical to start breaking.up some millions of acres now lying under grass.It is very important that the matter should be settled promptly. Time is very short, and in our variable climate delay often means the loss of opportunities, which may never recur.R. E. PROTHERO.8/
.7mCONFIDEhsTiACmPOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT160Summary of attached Programme (1918 Harvest). (England and Wales only).1.     The Department propose for the 1918 harvest:-a) to plough up 3;000,000 additional acres of grass land;b) to crop with wheat not less than 5,000,000 acres; and (c) to sow an extra million acres with barley and oats.This programme, if carried out, should produce sufficient bread stuffs to meet the requirements of the nation (with certain restrictions on the use of cereals for other purposes)&apos;.2.     To carry out the scheme above summarised, the Department will require:-)rs.        (i) 5,000 additional Tractors, with a corresponding supply of fuel.(ii) to borrow from the Home Army, oi? to secure from other sources, 60,000 Horses, isers. (iii) to import not less than 50,000 tons of phosphate rock a month, and to obtain through the Ministry of Munitions increased supplies of basic slag, sulphuric acid, etc. as specified..(iv) to set aside in readiness for early sowing this autumn not less than 100,000 quarters of seed wheat from the 1916 crop.3.     The minimum requirements as regards Labour are as follows:-(a) Retention by farmers of the full scale of skilled labour allowed under the Bath agreement, in addition to the0 -       40,000 men now on loan from the Army - or their equivalent in equally skilled hands. &apos;(b) An additional 80.000 able-bodied-men, borrowed as required from Home Forces (subject to. instant recall in case of threatened invasion) or supplied from other available&quot;Women&apos;ssources.(c) 25,000 whole-time workers from thein addition to the part-time women who are locally.Land Army&quot; now engaged4.     Apart from that portion of the programme for which the above mentioned supplies of tractors, horses, men, etc., will be i.required it is contemplated that farmers themselves will under-- take a certain proportion of the increased cultivation with their present resources.     The requirements specified by the Depart-ment are in every case minima, and any reduction &apos;in them will inevitably entail a corresponding reduction in the result achieved.     In short, every part of the scheme must be consider-ed as inter-dependent.     Finally, it is necessary to emphasise that the execution of the programme must be dependent upon normal weather conditions.Director-General of Food Production.
CONFIDENTIAL 161FOOD PRODUCT 10i4 DEPARTMENT.Proposed Programme (1918 Harvest).(England and Itales only).(1)   Of tfee 4,000,000 additional acres which -aould have to be ploucrh^d end cultivated in order to get back to the area under arable in 1874, It is estimated by the Food Production department that not more than 3,000,000 acres could be taken in hand, with the possible resources in sight&apos;, before April 1918.     Even this estimate is considered sanguine by -high agricultural authorities (Jtr. .$all&apos;s maximum figure is 2,200,000) and it can only be realised if all plans go well, if all the required resources are actually forthcoming, and if the weather is reasonably propitious.It is better, however, to aim at a high figure in order that the full corresponding requirements may be understood and provided in time, and so that every man con-cerned may know exactly the extent of the task that he will be called upon to perform.CONTEMPLATED PROGRAMME. (2)    The following figures and demands are, therefore, based upon the assumption that for the harvest of 1918:-3,000,000 edditional acres of grass land will be broken up, and that not less than5,000,000 acres in all will be brought under wheat in addition to an extra 1,000&quot;,000 acres of barley and oats.Assuming that the existing production of cereals in Scotland and Ireland is not reduced, the increased acreages in England and Wales above indicated should (at normal average yields) produce sufficient flour to meet the require-ments of the whole United Kingdom (viz. 90 million cwts) provided that the whole barley crop is milled for flour and none used for brewing or stock feedin?, and that the whole
wheat crop Is also reserved for human consumption.     In short the programme, if realised, should make the UnitedKingdom self-supoortin? in the matter of bread stuffs andtherefore safe fro^ its greatest peril.     The offals of thebarley crop,*hich would be very considerable, and of theyheat crop would be available for stock.THE FARMERS * TASK.(3)   Cf the 3j000,000 acres of grass above referred toit Is estimated that not less than 800,000 should be dealtwith by the farmers themselves, if their present resources,including existing Steam Tackle, are not appreciablydiminished *This additional acreage may seem small but it represents an extra task without any extra resources, and it would not be wise to count upon anything more.     It must be remembered that, in view of the shortage of feeding stuffs, grass and hay will.be exceptionally valuable this year.    In consequence   farmers cannot be expected to commence breaking up grassland until towards the end of June, and their ploughing will be again interrupted, from say mid-August until mid-November, for harvesting and dealing with existing arable. During those three months only such additional ploughing and cultivation will be possible as can be undertaken by Tractors and by extra men and horses supplied through the Agricultural Executive Committees.TASK OF AGRICULTURAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES. (4)     These Committees will have to arrange for the plough-ing of the 2,200,000 acres remaining; to complete the 3,000,000 required.     Cf this total it is estimated that not less than 1,000,000 acres will be ploughed by Government Tractors, that is presuming that the requisite number, with the requisite fuel, can be obtained in sufficient time.      (This question of Tractor and fuel supply is dealt with later on in this memorandum).LOAK OF ARMY AND OTHER HORSES. (5)    The 1,200,000 acres remaining to complete the
3,000,000 can only lee accomplished if it can be arranged to borrow from the Home Army and other sources 60,000 horses.     This point must be emphasised now in view of the new and increased demand for horses required for military purposes overseas.     Of the160,000 only a proportion would be required before the end of Hay Harvest.The arrangements under which horses are already being lent to farmers by the Military Authorities are working satis-factorily, and all that is required is an extension of the system.IIn considering any programme of breaking up grass, it must be remembered that the heaviest clay lands can only be ploughed before winter weather sets in, and this means that all available Steam Tackle and other mechanical ploughs should first be concen-trated on this part of the task.LABOUR REQUIREMENTS. (6)   The problem of Labour remain^ and besides being funda-mental, is by far the most difficult.     The situation has been care-fully reviewed,- in the light of recent experience, and the following conclusions have been arrived at:-To carry through and complete the programme of bringing an additional 3,000,000 acres under crops for the harvest of 1918. will necessitate the employment of the following labour, as a minimum!] (exclusive of any additional temporary assistance that will be essential at harvest time):-(a) Retention by farmers of the full scale of skilled labourallowed under the Bath agreement, in addition to the 40,000 men now on loan from the Army - or their equivalent in equally skilled hands.(b) An additional 80,000 able-bodied men, borrowed asrequired from Home Forces (subject to instant recall in case of threatened Invasion) or supplied from other available sources.Co) 25,000 whole-time workers from the &quot;Women1s Land Army&quot;, in addition to the part-time women who are now engaged locally.These figures, which may at first sight appear large, are in reality extremely moderate considering that 250,000 men, all able-
;;     1 -fix tib duuu^bodied and in most cases skilled, have been taken from Agriculture/since the beginning of the War. .16-4ARMY LABOUR.(7.)   The whole of this extra labour will not be required at once, and would only be called for gradually.    -Great importance, however, is attached to retaining as many as possible of the skilled ploughmen at present on loan from the Home Army, as they are now known to the farmers and accustomed to the horses and will be indis-pensable for ploughing the extra grass land.An excellent understanding has now been arrived at between the Board of Agriculture and the War Office and it is believed that if, subject to the initial decision of the Cabinet, the periodic negotiations for the ,.supply, or withdrawal as necessary, of such soldier labour as is required can be left solely in the hands of these two Departments, the problem is quite capable of a satisfactory solution.TRAINING AND ACCOMMODATION.(8)    The difficulties of providing accommodation for this greatly increased number of workers on the land, and of giving those without previous experience a modicum of agricultural training, have also to be faced and are engaging the earnest consideration of the Pood Production Department.(9)    The numbers specified under paragraph 6 (b) above, Include some 12,000 men &apos; who will be required to man the Government Tractors. As many of these as possible should have some mechanical knowledge, but this will be supplemented by the institution of training schools distributed over the country.TRACTORS_AND PLOUGHS.     . (10)   The provision of - the Tractors and ploughs is a much more anxious matter.     Owing to shipping and other difficulties, the importation of American machinery has been exceedingly disappointing.Out of the 600 tractors and ploughs ordered up to the middle of February by the Board of Agriculture, through the Ministry
]of Munitions, only 78 tractors and 214 ploughs have been delivered by April 1st.     About 30 more Tractors have since come in.     Since the creation of the Pood Production Department, an additional 790 tractors have been ordered through the Ministry of Munitions, most of which have not had time to arrive, and 91 more have been picked up retail by the Department through its own efforts.     The total number of G-overnment owned tractors delivered and now at work is, therefore, 224 only, the remainder of the 744 under control of the Department being merely borrowed from private owners, subject to return by May 1st.     By that date it is anticipated that the maximum number of Government owned tractors will not exceed 400, whilst in order to execute the programme of ploughing referred to in paragraph (4) above, the available number of machines -should rise tg not Isss than 6,000 by the end of the present year.SHIPPING DIFFICULTIES AND HOME MANUFACTURE.As tke shortage of shipping increases, and the American agricultural campaign developes, less and less reliance can be placed upon imported machinery and our needs will have to be met by manu-facture at home, assisted by every necessary form of Priority.(11)   This is a difficult problem, owing to the fact that there is no established Tractor industry on a large scale in this country, and no likelihood of creating one in time to be of much use this year.     The only solution, so far as the bulk of the supply is con-cerned, appears, therefore, to be to develop the suggestions made by a group of British motor manufacturers that they should combine resources to produce a replica of the Ford Tractor, which is extremely simple, and cheap, and has proved its practical value after a severe and extended trial by the Cheshire Agricultural Executive Committee.
x   These numbers are necessary in view of the agreement that one-seventh of all tractors obtained shall be allocated to Scotland and a similar proportion to Ireland.In this connection, Mr. Ford has offered to place the whole of his patents, patterns and specifications, gratuitously and unreservedly, at the disposal of the British Government, and if desired to send over his chief experts to assist in the manufacture. His only condition is that the tractors shall be made by the Government, for national use in a national emergency, and that they shall be neither marketed nor any profit made upon them, beyond the ordinary trade profit by the makers of the peddled-out parts.   This offer has been communicated to the Minister of Munitions, who has accepted it in principle.TRACTOR REQUIREMENTS.(12)       In any event, if the contemplated 1,000,000 acres ofgrass are to be broken up by Government tractors, it -7ill benecessary to secure an additional 5,000 with ploughs, before theend of December next.The following types and quantities are suggested, ifarrangements can be made for&apos; their manufacture and deliverywithin 8 months:-400 Saunderson and Mills &quot;Universal&apos;&apos; Tractors (at about  350 each.)100 &quot;Crawley Agrimotors&apos;1 (at about  400 each).500 &quot;Caterpillar&apos;1 Tractors, to the ne?/ agricultural designs worked out by Messrs. Clayton and Shuttleworth, and Messrs. Ruston and Proctor (at about  400 (?) each). 6000 replicas of the &quot;Ford&apos; Tractor (at about  90 each).Total 7000xNot less than 7,000x three and four furrow ploughs (preferably of the self-lift variety) will also be required and their manufacture will have to be organised.
The total cost of this machinery including spare parts, should be in the neighbourhood of  1,500,000 and the sanction of the Cabinet is sought for this expenditure.TRACTOR FUEL.(13) The operation of these tractors, together with those already in hand and ordered, will require a supply of paraffin, between now and April 1918, of not less than 7,000,000 gallons. An assurance has been received from the Manager of the newly formed &quot;Distributing Pool1&apos; that this quantity would probably be available for Tractor needs if it were earmarked now.   The sanction of the Cabinet is, therefore, sought on this point.TRACTOR ORGANISATION. (14) The distribution and control of the Government tractors will be placed upon a more satisfactory basis than could be adopted for the special emergency of the past 2 months. The eventual distribution will be worked out in relation to the areas to be dealt with and the responsibility for their operation and upkeep will rest mainly upon the Agricultural Executive Committees.FERTILISERS AND SEEDS. (15) It will be impossible to obtain for 1918 the full quantity of fertilisers which it would be desirable to apply to the present and the largely increased acreage under tillage, but in order to make the maximum use of quantities available arrangements with the different Departments concerned will have to be effected as followsAllowing for a full estimate for the needs of the Ministry of Munitions for the manufacture of explosives, agriculture should be able to secure for the 1918 harvest 200 to 250 thousand tons of sulphate of ammonia.As regards basic slag, the Ministry of Munitions
estimate that they rill he able to grind all slag of fairly ffood quality produced in this country.     This would increase the present output by 50/, and supply about 500,000 tons.     The tfhole summer and autumn output of basic slag will have to be made available for use on wheat land in England and Wales,The position with regard to superphosphate is less satisfactory. A great effort will have to be made to import at least as much rock as there is acid to dissolve which the Ministry of Munitions expect to be up to the normal level. A demand made three months ago for the importation of at least 30,000 tons of rock phosphate per month, has not sc far been met: the total amount Imported in February and March together being only 15,000 tons.Sot less than 50,000 tons of phosphate rock must be imported each month from June onwards if the increased production of cereals is to be realised, and in order that the price of superphosphate to farmers may not exceed the pre-war price by more than 75$, the freight must be supplied at requisition rates.(16) The position with regard tc seeds is as follows:-It will be necessary to begin sowing wheat unusually early, and if possible a considerable quantity should be sown before seed will be available from this yearrs harvest.    It would therefore be necessary to have not lesc, than 100,000 quarters of seed set aside in readiness far early sowing.To provide for an increased acreage in England and Wales of 200,000 acres above the present area of potatoes in 1918 it will be necessary, assuming the Scotch crop to prove satisfactory in 1917, to obtain in all not less than 300,000 tons of Scotch seed for England and Wales.
LOCAL ORGANISATION.(17) The programme described above can only be carried into effect by means of local organisation extending to every parish in the country and armed with the most drastic powers of compulsion. The existing organisation of County Executive Committees with sub-committees in every district will have to be strengthened and extended and furnished with ample funds to engage sufficient professional assistance. Each Committee will have to be allotted a definite task which they will be required to apportion to the different districts and the districts in turn will apportion their share to each parish and ultimately to each farm.   The task set should so far as possible be expressed in terms of increased yield as well as in increased area to be ploughed, since in view of the shortage of fertilisers it will be impossible to get the increased food required from the poorest grass land alone.This proposal involves a complete revolution in agricul-tural theory and practice. The reluctance of farmers, and even more of landowners and their agents, to plough up good grass land is well known and under pre-war conditions it may have been reasonable and even praiseworthy.. But in the present emergency agriculturists must learn that even good farming is less important than the production of the greatest possible amount of food and that they must be pre-pared to realise much of the capital which exists in the stored up fertility of the good grass land of the country. This is a lesson which will be distasteful to even the best farmers and we cannot hope that they will all accept it without compulsion. Moreover land owners who have in many cases sunk a considerable amount of capital in laying down land to grass will make claims for heavy compensation from the State if they believe that the value of their expenditure will be destroyed by the ploughing up of the land. Even the promise of guaranteed minimum prices for cereals will not persuade all of them that the bitter experience of the past may not be repeated,
19th April, 1917.and unless the grave peril v;ith which the nation is confronted is brought home to each one of them, they will not be convinced of the necessity of departing from the previously accepted principles of good husbandry and some of them may both actively and passively resist the demands&apos;which will have to be made on them.It is clear, therefore, that the compulsory powers which have already been given to Executive Committees may have to be exercised on a large scale and that it may not be an easy task in all cases for the Department to induce the Committees themselves to exercise their powers.    In some cases it may be necessary that the Board themselves should take action in default of action by the Committees.In any case it will be essential that a close and accurate survey should be made of the condition of every farm of over 50 acres in the country.   For this purpose it will probably be necessary to take powers to obtain a compulsory return under the Defence of the Realm Act from every occupier in the country and then to employ paid surveyors to inspect the farms and decide which fields should be ploughed and generally how the farms should be cultivated.   In short every farm will in effect have to become a controlled establishment.(Sgd.)    ARTHUR LEE.Director General of Food Production.
