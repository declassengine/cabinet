War Cabinet,.In view of the repeated requests1 of the Portuguese Government for more Transports and Destroyers, it is desirable that the War Cabinet should be made aware of the facts mentioned in the enclosed paper.(signed) .T.R..JELLICOE..First Sea Lord. 26th. April 1917.
FOR INFORMATION OF THE&quot; WAR CABINET.Concerning the question of the transportation of more troops from Lisbon to France which has been proposed, the following remarks are put forward with a view to the War Cabinet being apprised of the condition of affairs with regard to the discipline and general management of the Portuguese troops on board.the transports.On account of the various letters from the waval Transport Officer at Lisbon complaining of the general behaviour and lack of discipline of the Portuguese troops on board the transports, I arranged to discuss the matter with the Portuguese Minister and the Portuguese Naval Attache.   These two gentlemen kindly came to see me yesterday, and the following is a resume of what occurred at my interview,I handed to the Portuguese Minister a general statement of the complaints which have been made from time to time by. the *&apos;Taval Transport Officer, Lisbon.   The Minister, discussed all these questions most freely, and I have at last persuaded him to Use his endeavours with his Government to induce, them to take steps to promote a better&quot; state of discipline in the transports.   The Minister freely admitted that there was a great lack of discipline, but said that this oust be expected owing to the fact that there were many Royalists and Republicans, amongst the troops, and there were also German sympathisers whose influence was very strong amongst these troops-.I asked him if measures.could be taken to induce theofficers on board the transports to go. round the decks andvisit the troops more frequently with a view to checking;-    as ?irregularities such/have been reported, viz:- the cutting up of lifebelts and in one case incendiarism.   Ee stated that the officers were not like British officers and had not such command of their, men as had the British^, but that he felt.sure
fi that discipline amongst the troops was improving every jay that they were in France.As Regards the lack cf cleanliness which is so -bad as ;o cause the ship to be insanitary, he stated that the average Portuguese had never learnt to behave in a sanitary way, in that the troops from the country were not used to using latrines etc.-, but that they would soon learn after they had been in France for some time, and not heir-? used to ships or latrines was the reason for them performing their evacuations all over the ship,.Altogether from my conversation with the Minister-, I gathered that there is little likelihood of any great improvement taking place.   However, in conclusion the Minister assured me that he would communicate with his Government on the subject generally,I gathered from r ading between the lines of his general conversation that the great object from the Portuguese point of view was to get these men out of Portugal and it appeared&apos; to me to be very much at the expense of the Allies generally(Initialed.)
