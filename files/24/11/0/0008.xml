To let communications on different subjectsCorrespondents are requested :  t To quote the Number, Date, and HeadingEDINBURGH.form separate letters.No.TelegrapMc Address-&quot; BOAS, EDINBURGH.3rd April, 1917.Enclosure, Sir,I am directed &quot;by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to draw the attention $f your Committee to the powers oonferred on them by Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 R as recently amended - a oopy of which is enclosed.     From this ycu will observe that, the Board may; with a view to reducing injury to orops by game birds, hares or rabbits, er to securing for the food-supply of the country any migratory kind of wild bird, take such action as in their opinion is necessary for this purpose.     The Board have asked expert advice as to the desirability of removing the restrictions provided by the Wild Birds Protection Acts on the killing of migratory kinds of wild fowl in Scotland, but apart from praotical difficulties of identification and shooting they understand that the only migratory wild birds in this oountry at present are denizens ef Northern Europe which are already on their way back to their homes after wintering here. . Under these oircumstanees the Board do net pro-ipoee to take any action in this direotion.    A few oomplaints hare been received as to damage by pheasants, but so fax the Board have net considered it advisable to issue an Order authorising their de-tstruotion by occupiers of agricultural land.The Board hare had brought to their notioe numerous complaints that damage has been done by rabbits, black-gams, wood-pigeons, wild geese, wild-duck, rooks and sparrows, but they would remind you that only ground game and migratory wild birds or game birds come within the terms of the regulation.    This consideration rules out the possibility of taking action against some of the birds speoified in this list.    In this connection, however, it has been suggested that there should be no olose season for Blaok Game this year, and that the opening of the grouse-shooting season should be advanced a week or so.Rabbits are being dealt with in a separate Order whioh will be issued without delay with a circular explaining the effect of its provisions.Before considering the advisability of framing any further Order under this regulation, the Board would be glad to have the views of your Committee on the subjeot, and any suggestions whioh your Committee have to make arising out of oomplaints which have been made to them regarding depreciations of any kind.     In so doing the Board suggest that it will be well to bear in mind that any general or indiscriminate destruction of wild birds, might defeat the object in view, by removing the means which nature has provid-:ed for keeping down inseot pests.I am, Sir,l8 Secretary,District AgriculturalExecutive Committee,Yaur obedient Servant,H, II. C017ACHER,Secretary.
