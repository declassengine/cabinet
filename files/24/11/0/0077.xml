SECRET. G.T. 577-WAR CABIKET.Letter from M.A. Petrograd to the Director of Military IntelligencePetrograd.15th April, 1917.My dear General,There is a hag going out to-morrow so I am sending you a few lines though I fancy that our wires have given you an idea of the progress of events here.There is no doubt that the Extreme Socialists with their &quot;Stop the war&quot; programme have lost power.     The idea found little support among the troops who have had practical experience of the Hun, and as a shibboleth it is being dropped. It has also been pointed out that the hand of friendship extended to the proletariat of&quot; all nations is still &quot;hanging in the a.ir&quot;for no one has grasped it and the only reply has heen on theaStokhod.      It takes two to make/peace and the German Govt.  is not going - to show its hand by openly approaching a minority party here.iThe troops have not taken kindly to the 8 hour programme for workmen and the alliance of workmen and soldiers is not as solid as- it was.This is all to the good but we are really dangerously near anarchy.     The -Govt. have*not yet&quot;established a police but pay so called volunteers 240 roubles a month for doing the work that the poor devils of the old regime did for Rs.25 and what they could make in tips.       Some at any rate of these &quot;militiamen&quot; as they are called are very doubtful characters. The state of things at Kronstadt is a continued, disgrace to anything that calls itself a government.     The place has been brought under the C. in Chief of the Petrograd District, but I don&apos;t believe anything but force will bring the convicts there to their senses.     Keronski has been down there and one General/Potapov
- 2 -305Potapov a member of the Duma Mily:      Commission went there and theyboth published optimistic accounts in the papers that everyoneknows are lies.     Prince Lvov is very optimistic.      Guchkov hasmore honesty or sense and candidly allows that the Govt. has notthe force on which it.can &quot;depend to enforce order.Naturally the troops at Petrograd who have expelled3/4ths of their officers do nothing and have no sign ofdiscipline.      The state of things on the railways may beillustrated by a few extracts from an appeal from the Ministryof Ways that is published in yesterday&apos;s Journal of the Councilof Working men and Soldier Deputies.&quot;The Ministry of Ways has appealed to the Minister of War and to the Council of W. and S.Ds asking them to assist in the regulation of passenger traffic on the railways.K K K KOn the railways at present large parties of soldiers are being carried and they are entirely disorganising the passenger service.      On several lines special trains have been allotted for. the use of so-ldiers but as these trains are slow, the soldiers do not use them hut crowd into passenger trains without tickets, occupying places allotted to passengers and filling up the corridors.In addition to this on several lines soldiers have forced the railway personnel to allow the military trains to run in advance of all passenger trains,  clearing the line for the purpose - a proceeding which causes the complete disorganisation of not only passenger but also goods traffic.Such conduct in addition to disorganising the whole railway service,  is an actual danger, for passenger cars are not built to support crowded corridors;    there have been frequent cases of broken springs which might have had very serious consequences.Immediate steps must be taken to establish order by the use of moral suasion among the soldiery and by detaching to all large stations special armed parties and representatives of the local Council of Working men and Soldier Deputies.&quot;Abour ten days ago a messenger with Embassy bags for Baku arrived at the Nikolas Station with his wife but found the coupe he had engaged and paid for occupied by ten soldiers and sailors who refused to move and the station master when appealed to said it would cause bloodshed to try to expel them. He had to abandon all idea of travelling that night.Guchkov and A.lexyeev between them have kicked out 76 generals.     Heaven knows how many officers the men have kicked/out t
out, of course far less then have been expelled by the depot units in Petrograd, but still a good many. .    I know for instance that 6 good officers of the Moskov^ski Regt.  of the Guard who had been expe&apos;1&apos;led by the men came back to Petrograd by a single train. Presumably the authorities fire fellows because they are slack but I believe that the men fire most of them because they are strict and not easy going enough.      It will be interesting to note the type of officer that will stick in spite of this purging from both ends.      The worst of it is that our great weakness before was the shortage of officers and it is far easier out here to fire than to replace.The Govt. it seems to me have given up all attempt to protect the unfortunate army from political agitators.      It pursues in all things the policy of &quot;Walt and See&quot;.      It allows anti-war propaganda till the army interferes.      It does not recognise that the first duty of a govt. is to leave the army free to pursue its main task of beating the enemy.     It pretends to think that these regimental committees which have taken unto them-selves all the power formerly held by officers are ah excellent institution.      It imagines that the officers whom it has allowed the men to insult with impunity when not actively engaged will at once be able to assert their authority when in action.Agitation that would have no-effect on men of more cultured nations is very dangerous here.     The war without &quot;annexations&quot; of the Petrograd theorists is interpreted in thetrenches as absolute passivity.     An officer from Riga tells me thatsay theynis rnen/won&apos;t go beyond the frontier and they look upon the first line of trench as the frontier;    hence no raiding or reconnaissance.     We have had great difficulty in getting identifications from the more passive sections of the front under/the
the old order and under the new we will have little chance of getting them unless we go out and raid ourselves.Officers in Petrograd have taken to wear mufti which was formerly forbidden to avoid the more or less direct insultwhich uniform entails in the street.     Poor, devils it has cost, . terrible, ^,them a lot and they have/trouble with their ties.I hope that some arrangement may be made to use thediscarded officers by the American Govt.     Of course some ofthem are rotters but I believe that most of the ones that themen have turned out are above the average in the Russian army.At present they are not allowed to leave Russia.Well I only hope that all I have written is pessimism.Of course I am dependent on the yarns of officers from thefront; but I will believe them against the politicans tillevidence shows I am wrong.     Thornhill went to the Western Fronton Friday&apos;and I am going to run along the Northern Frontstarting tomorrow.     We are both going simply to study the &quot;newdiscipline&quot; and I hope we will be able to telegraph you soonafter you get this what our impressions are.The best type of staff officers in whom one can haveconfidence think that all this nightmare will pass and thatthings will be right by June.      I know there are great latentqualities in the Russian character and we can only pray thatthe officers may be supermen enough to regain their prestige.It is all very painful for me for I know so many of them and Iknow and love the army here.Two months ago a Colonel called Shulgin lunched with mehere,     I had known him all the war as a first rate officer.For the first year he was in command of the mounted scoutsof the Preobrajenski Regiment.     Last autumn he got command ofa regiment in the 3rd Special Division then destined for Francebut held back on account of the Rumanian fiasco.     He wasenthusiastic about his regiment said he had collected a splendid/lot
lot of officers including 5 from his. old corps, that the men were all keen and young^ that I must come to see it as soon as I could, he would send a sledge to the station etc.       He was only staying two days in Petrograd because his regiment was young and wanted, constant looking after.     Last week his adjutant brought me a letter &quot;to be personally delivered&quot;.      It was a simple request to be taken with the best 5 officers of his regiment into the British service.     The adjutant said that their regt. had held out longer than any other in the Division but all discipline was finished now.     The Divn. had been ordered to relieve one in the front line E. of Friedrichstadt before the Easter holidays.      The men refused to go till after the holidays. The officers were quite without authority though few of them had been expelled.     Each company had elected 8 representatives. Of the 96, 8 had been selected to attend the Army Council at Divinsk, they had gone there and nothing more had been heard of them.     Others had been sent to Petrograd.The men crowd all the tramways in Petrograd to suffocation and no one dares ask them to pay.     It would be a relief to many of the general public &quot;if the Germans would come&quot;.I have telegraphed to you that the factories are working up to only \% in many cases and in others from 30 to 60$ of what they produced in the last month of the regime.      The reason, is partly the 8 hour day for of course there are not enough skilled hands for three shifts, the&quot;idiotic expulsion .of many experts by the men and more than everything the general want of discipline.      The men work for an hour or so and then some lunatic appears calling out &quot;Comrades a meeting&quot; and they all crowd out to listen to some impossible stuff.     The Russian loves speaking and he has never been allowed to speak before.     Of course the workmen have their defence.     One of thern came to the Embassy today with the telegram from the Woolwich Arsenal to translate. He said that his Factory, the Petrograd Gun Factory, would work
up to full time if it had .raw material and fuel.      I asked him ahout the experts that had been expelled and he said they had only driven away officers.who sat apart from the workmen and had no practical knowledge of the job.     He had seen English engineers who had come out with some range finders.      The engineer worked with the workmen and no one could say which was the engineer and who was the labourer;     There is truth in this too, but I hear from private employers who have no officers in their works that many essential experts have been turned out.     This man yesterday was very evidently pleased with the telegram but he said that the Provisiona.l Govt. was not the one his people wanted, that they.had only one of their men in it - Keronski - and that they would keep their arms after the war and get what they wanted.Today is Easter Sunday and the Russian 6.S. was locked up.      The only officers there were the French and British and their clerks.      They crept in by the back entrance.      We start an hour earlier than the Russians and work from 2 to 3 hours later on ordinary days.     Russian officers in the Artillery Dept. tell me that their clerks leave at 4 sharp and they can&apos;t get any work done after that.     One of them who has been years and years in the Dept.  said to me today that he was thinking of trying to go to the front apparently for safety as there he would only have the enemy in front of him.Kornilov is a grand little man.     A man in the Pavlovisi Regt. asked him the other day:    &quot;General when will we have a parade?&quot;     Kornilev said:    &quot;You will have a parade as soon as you have some sort of order.     Do you think I could show the Russian People such rubbish as you are&quot;.Yours very &quot;Sin^,(Sd)   Alfred Knox.
