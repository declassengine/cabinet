9 9 Kt)   3a DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). EC RET..P.194 (29). COPY NO._C A B I N g T.LEGISLATION FOR THE REGULATION AND CONTROL OF ROAD TRAFFIC.lviemorandum by the Minister of transport.Lord Cecil has given notice of a question, for oral answer in the House of Lords on July 11th, as follows&apos;:To ask His Jiajesty&apos;s Government whether they intend to introduce legislation with the object of regulating hoad Traffic and increasing the safety and comfort of those who use the highways of the country.&quot;The question of the better control and regulation of road traffic has been very much before the public during the past few years and has bulked largely in the columns of the press.     This has been due to the alarming rate of increase in the number of road accidents since the war, and to the fact that the existing body of law on the regulation of road traffic (particularly in regard to the speed limit) is entirely out of date.Partly on account of this agitation the late Government appointed the Royal Commission on Transport in the autumn of last year and obtained an assurance from the Chairman that the Commission would hear evidence and present a First Report at the earliest possible date on that part of their terms  of reference which covered the regulation and control of road vehicles from, the point of view of public safety,      I have seen the Chairman, Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen, and he informs me that this Report will be presented before  the end of the month.Lord Cecil himself introduced a Road Vehicles Regulation Bill in the House of Lords last session.     The bill received a Second Reading and was referred to a Select Committee of the house.
-2-The Second Reading debate afforded evidence of the strength of the feeling on all sides of the House In the matter, and of the general conviction that legislation on the subject was long overdue.     The Select Committee after hearing evidence reported to the House that they could not see their way to amend Lord Cecil&apos;b Bill so as to make it a workable measure and it therefore proceeded no further. the same time the Committee concluded theirReport as follows&quot;The Committee wish to conclude their Report with an earnest recommendation that the Minister of Transport should present his own Road Traffic Eill to Parliament without further delay.     The whole question of the regulation of Road Vehicles is in urgent need of revision and reform, and the Committee earnestly hope that regulation accompanied by proper enforcement of the law will be undertaken in the immediate future and that it will result in a substantial diminution of the accidents which continue to occur in such large numbers throughout the Kingdom. In this connection they desire to draw attention to the fact that fatal accidents in the Metropolitan Police Area increased from 960 in 1927 to 1,230 in 1928.     In the whole country they amounted 1 to no less than 6,138.&quot;There can be little doubt that if no immediate action is taken by the Government on the Royal Commission&apos;s forthcoming Report,.Lord Cecil will introduce a fresh Eill this session and the House of Lords is likely to insist upon passing some measure and will thus throw upon the Government the onus of refusing to      H proceed.In the course of the Debate which will take place on Thursday next, July 11th, on Lord Cecil1s question, Lord Russell will have to make some statement as to the Governments intentions [&apos;;, and I seek authority for him to reply to the following effect:-
9th July, 1929(Intld.)     H.M.nThe Minister of Transport has received an assurance from the Chairman of the Royal Commission on Transport that a First Report may be expected from the Royal Commission before the summer recess, dealing with the regulation and control of road vehicles generally from the point of vie\7 of public safety. So soon as the Report is received, consideration will be given to the Royal Commission1s recommendations with a view to the introduction of a Bill.     The progress of the Bill would have to depend upon the state of the Parliamentary time-taole^ and at this stage of the session the Government is unable to give any pledge in this respect.&quot;The House of Lords frequently complain that they have nothing to do during the early part of the session, and a Bill such as this, which is entirely non-political (which, I agree, does not of necessity mean non-controversial) might with advantage be introduced in that House and the details thrashed out there before it comes to the Commons.
