hi (J &apos;this DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. COPY NO . pl^-,ISSUE OF UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES TO THE PRESS. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.SECRET.CP. 182 (29).I have been considering whether to continue the practice, which is now of some years&apos; standing, according to which a weekly statement of the unemployed &quot;live register&quot; is Issued to the Press.   The question is not free from difficulty but on the whole I have come to the conclusion that the weekly issue should be stopped and a monthly issue substituted.The weekly figures are easily misunderstood or misrepresented they are influenced by all kinds of temporary circumstances and are apt to be quite misleading Twhen taken singly.   Even worse is the fact that this &quot;bulletin&quot; issued week by week has s- sort of psychological effect which is harmful to the prestige and well-being of British industry.    It gives our own public and the public of other countries an exaggerated and depressing view of the character and extent of unemployment In Great Britain.    Those engaged in anti-British propaganda are provided with ready material for arguing that British industry is &quot;down-and-out&quot;.These points were emphasised by a deputation to the Ministry from the Association of British Chambers of Commerce on 3rd July; in introducing the deputation, Sir Walter Raine spoke of the harm done abroad to British Industry by the present method of presenting the figures, and asked whether the numbers in employment oould not be published as well as the numbers    &quot;j unemployed.I note, also, that at the meeting of the Board of Trade/Advisory
Advisory Council on 12th June, Sir Hugo Hirst said much the same thing in connection with an Empire tour which he had just made.There are, from time to time, critical references to the practice in the Press, the most recent toeing the comments on what was said by the Chambers of Commerce Deputation a few days ago;   and these references are sometimes supported by reports of the views of representative men in industry unfavourable to the practice.No other country (except Prance, whose figures are cf practically no value) issues a weekly figure.   Germany publishes a definite monthly figure, and a provisional one mid-monthly.   Other countries, so far as they furnish figures at all, do so once a month or once a quarter.In short, if it had not been the practice to issue these weekly figures, no one would propose to begin it now.   The difficulty is to discontinue it.   It might be alleged that our object was to conceal the figures for political reasons, at a time of year when the totals will -probably be increasing. If there were acute controversy on the point, the result would be to attract even greater attention to the figures and in the end more harm than good might be done.In point of fact, I should not propose to conceal any of the figures.   The weekly figures would still be collected and would be published as at present in the monthly Labour Gazette; the only change would be that they would not be given weekly to the Press.Nevertheless, I do not under &quot;estimate the force of what I may call the political objection, and I should be glad to know if any of my colleagues think it serious enough to tie our hands.   Personally I am so impressed by the bad/psychological
9 Ghj O upsychological, effect of the present practice that I think the change ought to be made.It is possible that the weekly figures will be asked for in Parliamentary Questions.    I hope this will not be so, but if such questions are put down I must discourage them as best I can.   F,ven if the figures have to be given in this way the effect will not be the same as that of the present weekly bulletin.The monthly statement to be issued to the Press should, I suggest, be rather more elaborate than the weekly statement now issued.    It would give the average live register for the month and not the separate weekly figures, and I should propose to include in it the estimated number of insured workpeople in employment, at a date in the month.It would, of course, be essential to announce the proposed change in the House of Commons, with the reasons for it.    In making this axmouncement I should not hesitate to say quite frankly that -(l) during the next few months the figures are likely to increase for seasonal and other reasons; and(2) it will be my aim to ensure that the live register Includes as high a percentage as possible of the total number of unemployed.Accordingly, if my colleagues agree, I propose to make a suitable announcement at the first opportunity in the House of Commons, and to introduce the new practice as soon as possible afterwards.(Intd) M* a. B.Ministry of labour. 6th July. 1929.
