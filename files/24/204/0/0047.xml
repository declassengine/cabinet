The attached Memorandum sets out the considered views of the Admiralty on the Memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs in CP. 192(29 ).(Intd. )     A.     V.ADMIRALTY,  S.W.9th July, 1S29.
9 0 0wooffSB   OPTIONAL  . CLAUSE. NAY Ah IETERESTS TO BE SAffSGUARDED.The Admiralty view with much pertubation t,he proposals in the memoecirculated hy the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs in CP. 192(29).   Their chief interest in any reserva-tions which may be inserted when signing the Optional Clause - is to ensure that our belligerent rights are safeguarded from the arbitral decision of the lawyers of Powers with no real Naval interests who will certainly oppose the British view.2.       Should Great Britain be involved in a war the Idea of arbitration on belligerent rights must cause tbe gravest misgivings if one is convinced, as the Admiralty are convinced, that   a body  constituted li3ce the Permanent Court of Inter-national Justice would give ah adverse decision on many issues that arose in the course of Naval Operations in the Great War, and may be important in another war.3.       Such decision may be given by such a body - largely constituted of biassed neutrals - in the early stages of a long war; and even pending the arbitral decision, the Court or Neutral will ask us to stop the practice complained of, and the Navy will almost certainly be instructed accordingly.Our sea power will be stultified.More generally,  Great Britain has upheld particular views of maritime law in time of war and claims In this field of International Law where there are   admittedly both uncertainties and deficiencies as to the rules forming the content of accepted law, that certain courses of action are legal; it is only prudent to make it clear that this country is not prepared to accept as binding views which It has never accepted and which it may, in the heat of war, be disinclined to obey.3o       there are possibilities of wars outside the two groups of disputes mentioned in paragraphs 51 and 60 of C.P.192(29) and yet the argument in paragraphs 41 - 63 of that paper largely rests on the wars being exhaustively classified under two headings only, namely(i )     When Great Britain is at war in self-defence.(ii)   When Great Britain is at war at the instance of the Council of the League..There are, however, other possibilities of war for members of the League without violating their engagement under the Covenant: e.g., when the Council of the League fails to reach a unanimous report - a contingency that is perhaps more possible when powerful nations are &quot;Involved and when belligerent rights are therefore more important than when minor Powers are disputants.     As long as there are possibilities of war other than in self-defence and in support of the League, the proposals   in C.P.192(g9) fail to safeguard the chief weapon of this country..4.       It  would be very anomalous that the Permanent Court should become an organ for controlling Naval operations involving-ing the security of the British Empire.     Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice would appear to be intended to deal with bona fide justiciable matters and not with questions which have such a political bearing on the security of a nation as belligerent rights.
5.       -The Admiralty would strongly recommend J hat the proposed reservation in paragraph 72 of C*P*192(29), which reads :-&quot;other than disputes which arise out of action taken at the instance of the Council of the League of Nations in pursuance of the obligat 10113 imposed upon Members of the League by the terms of the Covenant&quot;should   be altered to read:-&quot;other than disputes whioh arise out of war&quot; measures, H..M,Government claiming that the pacific settlement of any such disputes shall be sought by subraiss5on to the Council of the League of Nations, as laid down in paragraph 3 of Article 15 of the Covenant &quot;oThis amendment would indicate cur willingness that questions relating to war measures should be brought before the Council of the League if the other party to the dispute presses the matter beyond diplomatic protest .6o       The final reservation proposed in Article 72 of CoPo 182(29) has considerable Laval bearings.     The Admiralty would have   preferred,  owing to the    importance of Egypt in inter-imperial defence, that the possibility of arbitra-tion with that country should have been entirely excluded. The    suggested reservation should, if is considered, not be weakened, and it is hoped that it may be possible to strengthen it.
