HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTSSEC R E T. -.g, 183  (29),COPY NO.24CABINET.tniSMPLOSMBNT COMMITTEE.ASSISTANCE TO PUBLIC UTILITY UNDERTAKINGS.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal,I  desire   to draw the attention of my thecolleagues to/proposals contained in paragraphs 1 to 4, inclusive, of the attached Report submitted to the Interdepartmental Committee on Unemployment by a Sube Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher.It will be observed that in the Sub-Committee1s view a progressive polioy to deal with unemployment should concentrate, so far as possible, upon measures which will aid the economic development and equipment of the country and, at the same time, facilitate the Transfer and Training policy.       Accordingly, the Sub-Committee suggest   that the activities of the Unemployment Grants Committee in relation to revenue producing schemes promoted by Public Utility Companies should be merged in the Governments wider plans for giving assistance to such schemes on a more extended basis - including Railways.      In future, these schemes should be dealt with by the Departments concerned, with the advice of a small Expert Committee on the lines of the Trade Facilities Committee, the necessary financial provision being authorised by Parliament, for which purpose immediate legislation \vould be necessary to enable assistance to be given (by way of guarantee and/or grant)
to ensure the patting in hand by railways and other public utility undertakings of revenue producing works.So far as guaranteed loans are concerned it was suggestedthrift a limit should be set at   5 millions,,   Assistance , by way of grant, will be charged to Departmental Votes,After consideration of this Report by the Interdepartmental Cocnmittee on Unemployment, I have cometo the conclusion that these proposals should &quot;be adopted and I accordingly Invite the Cabinet to give their formalapproval to thenu       When this has been done, the Treasurywill arrange with        Parliamentary Counsel for thepreparation of the draft Bill which it will be necessaryto pass Into la.w before.. e the August Recess.I may add that a Conference   is to be held with Lord St, Davids, the Chairman of the unemployment grants Committee, with regard to certain questions relatingto the conditions to be attached to the assistance to begiven in future by that Committee to Local Authorities,in accordance with the proposals contained in paragraph 5of the Sub-Committee1s Report.(sea.) j*h- thomas.-Treasury Chambers,27th June, 1529.
&amp; 1/ 9DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S  GOVERNMENT).I NTER-DErARTMENTAL COXJITTEE ON UNEMPLOYMENT .Report of Su.brCommittee on asclotanaa to Local Authorities and. Public Utility Companies.1.      Over and above the steps taken to expand foreign trade and to bring about extended colonial trade and develop-ment, a progressive policy to deal with unemployment should concentrate upon measures that will aid the economic develop-ment and equipment of the country while at the same time facilitating the Transfer and Training policy.      On the assumption that the amount of Exchequer assistance available is not unlimited,  it is important that the employment energy generated by that assistance should not be dissipated over a large number of small schemes and that, subject to special cases, attention should be fccusaedupon larger schemes of an economic character.2.      In accordance with this vie?? it is suggested that the activities of the Unemployment Grants Committee in relation  to revenue-producing schemes promoted by public utility companies activities that are now on a small seals - should be merged in the Governmentxs wider plans for giving assistance to such schemes on a more extended basis - including Railways - and that,  in future,  applications from public utility undertakings in respect of revenue-producing schemes should be made to the appropriate Department, e*ga tho Ministry of Transport or Ministry of Health, and should then be examined by thatRET.(29)  19.A 3 I  KE T.
Department (in consultation with, the Ministry of Labour fromthe point of view of transfer and training) and, after any necessary adjustments, approved by the Treasury.3.     To provide the necessary finance and statutory authority an emergency Bill should be In troduoed at once,authorising the assistance needed (by way of guarantee and/orgrant) to ensure the putting in hand by railways and publicutility companies of revenue-producing works.      So far as guaran-teed loans are concerned it Is suggested that a limitsshould be set at the sum of  25 millions.      Over and ab?ve this funds would have to be voted by Parliament as required to meet the cost of assistance given by way of grant towards meeting interest charges.      The amounts required would depend upon the volume of work undertaken*4.     In deciding upon applications for assistance to public utility undertakings in respect of revenue-producing schemes the Departments and the Treasury would have regard to whether the scheme was one that would add to economic equipment or would effect needed public facilities., that it was a scheme that would fit in with the transfer policy, and was work that was being accelerated and wo-uld not be entered into without State assistance.       They should have the advice of a small expert Committee on the lines of the Trade Facilities Committee. The existence of a Committee of this kind (the establishment of which would assist the passage of the Bill in Parliament) weald facilitate the Unemployment policy, the Committee being _ -2-h   Experience has shown that a moderate amount of this kind is both more acceptable to Parliament and less unsettling to the Money Market, than a more spectacular figure, while if it should prove practicable and tiocessary to assist schemes costing a larger sum there would be time and opportunity to seek further Statutory authority.-
able perhaps to suggest modifications and improvements in schemes which, without such modification, could not qualify for assistance.5.      The Unemployment Grants Committee should remain authorised to give grants on the present basis to Local Authoritieo able to put in hand works of an approved character but (while they might give assistance in special cases) they would fall in line with the Government&apos;s general policy and give prierity to larger schemes of an economic or useful character, with preference to those fitting In with the Transfer and draining schemes.      The Unemployment Grants Committee should continue to be able to give assistance on existing terms (75% of the interest and sinking fund charges ^r any lean for the first- half of the loan period up to 15 years or, in the case of works financed out of revenue, 75% of the wages bill) in areas of exceptional unemployment. 6.    For administrative reasons the responsibility for the Vote for the Unemployment Grants Committee should rest with the Ministry of Labour as the Department concerned with the relief of Unemployment and in charge of the machinery for training and transfer--3-/   The present terms are set out in the Appendix.
