QUESTION OP AMENDING LEGISLATION.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Sootland; 1,     Representations in favour of the suspension of tile Local Government ohanges introduced by the Local Government (Scotland) Aot, 1929, and the appointment of a Royal Commission of enquiry into the Scottish Local Government system h*ve been received by me from bodies whioh are being abolished by the Act (Education Authorities, District Committees and Parish Councils) and from bodies from which powers are being transferred (Town Councils of small burghs),2.     To give effect to these representations would require legislation and the necessary Bill would have to provide not merely for continuing the bodies referred to and the present system of grants, but also for suspending the operation of the Block Grant system contained in the Act.     The latter would raise difficult questions as to what would happen to the new money (amounting to nearly  1,000,000 per annum) which is provided by the Aot as part of the Block Grant.     In the Bill it would be necessary to provide for oompensation to rating authorities for loss of rates due to de-rating which took effect in Scotland as from 16th May last.3.     I am advised that it is essential that any Bill suspending the Act, either in whole or in part, would require to be introduced immediately and passed through all its stages before Parliament rises in July and. it seems to me th^-t there is little likelihood of our being able, within the limited time at.our disposal, to carry through a measure involving such large issues as I have indicated in the preceding paragraph.
4.   On examination of the position,- however, I find that it would &quot;be possible to continue the existing ad hop Education Authorities without disturbing the financial scheme of the Aot - the grants fox education not having been&quot; included in the Block Grant money.     The abolition of the ad hoc education authority was strenuously opposed by my oolleagues and nryBelf when the Bill was -under discussion, and I believe there is a Btrong body of opinion in Sootland which supports the line we then took and would welcome a Bill which wodld suspend the provisions abolishing the ad hog education authority, so as to give time for inquiry into the matter of&quot; educational administrationv5.     Ifj therefore, there is a reasonable prospeot that time can be found before Parliament rises t6 pass a Bill of this naturej I would recommend its introduction.     It is* of course, certain that such a measure would be contre-veraial, but I do not anticipate that the opposition would be very vehement, although it would have the support of the Teachers *. Organisation.     It mist also be kept in view that the reprieve of the education authorities might annoy still further the local authorities who are left to suffer under the Act especially the town councils of small burghs and the parish councils *WM.
