[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, j 9 9Printed for the Cabinet.   June 19:29.Copy No.   24CABINET.REPORT OF THE EXPERTS&apos; COMMITTEE ON german reporation.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.i. Amount of the Annuities.THE Experts recommend that the new plan should come into effect as from the 1st September next, the present Dawes annuity continuing till then. Germany is to pay  37 millions for the 7 months to the 31st March, 1930, and thereafter 36 annuities rising from  85 millions in the first year to  120 millions in 1965-6. These (on the 5^ per cent, basis adopted by the Young Committee) are equivalent to 37 annuities of  99^ millions.A fixed amount of each annuity, viz.,  33 millions, is unconditional, and must be paid in foreign currency; the remainder is normally also payable in foreign currency, but Germany has, as regards this portion, the right to pay in marks, and to postpone transfer for not more than 2 years.From 1966 onwards Germany is to pay 22 more annuities representing simply War Debt cover and averaging about  80 millions.*SECRET.CP. 160 (29).II. Distribution.An annexe to the Report contains a tabular statement showing what sum each creditor country is to receive in each of the 37 years out of these annuities. (As stated above, the payments for the last 22 years are merely War Debt cover.) The principle on which the table has been compiled is not apparent, but two facts are clear : (a) that France is to get  25 millions out of the  33 millions of the unconditionalannuity, and(b) that the distribution is not in accordance with that required by existing agreements, i.e., with the Spa percentages.The following are the average shares and variations from the Spa allotments for the various creditors : Annual Share. Loss or Gain.  Millions.

The Dawes annuities were for  125 minions, but payable in marks, which were to be transferred into foreign currencies only so far as this would not endanger the German exchange. No period of years was fixed.[19474]
------ These figures are all worked out on the     per cent, interest table used by the expert Committee, but, in calculating the average losses or gains over 37 years, a 5  per cent, table does not give sufficient weight to the political and economic uncertainties of the future Reparation payments, and if a higher rate of interest were adopted, the figures of losses and gains would be reduced, e.g., on the 1\ per cent, table our loss would average  1  millions a year&quot; instead of  2 millions. It is also to be noted that our losses tend to be concentrated into the later years, e.g., over the first 10 years we suffer no reduction from our Spa percentage, while over 20 years our loss is no more than  600,000 a year. The losses of the U.S.A., on the other hand, are concentrated upon the early years. ,It will be seen, therefore, that under the distribution proposed we secure cover for our American Debt for the future (as well as a share for the Dominions, which does not differ appreciably from what they would get if the Spa percentages had been applied). But we secure nothing against our arrears, i.e., the amounts by which our payments to the U.S.A. have been uncovered in the past. These arrears, with interest, are now about  200 millions. If the Young Committee had been content to apply the Spa percentages (instead of in effect increasing Italy&apos;s share at our expense), we should in the course of time have got something towards arrears. What this something would be is, as was stated above, conjectural. It would amount to nothing on the average of the first 10 years, and would amount at most to an average of  2 millions a year over the full 37 years. The capital equivalent would, of course, represent only a small fraction of our arrears. Incidentally, it may be pointed out that even if the Dawes annuity of  125 millions were to remain in force indefinitely our Spa. share of it would only recover us a fraction though a more substantial fraction of our arrears.III. The Bank for International Settlements.The Reparation Commission is to be superseded by the Bank for International Settlements, and Allied control for internal German affairs is to be discontinued. The Bank is also intended to increase the world&apos;s trade by financing projects, particularly in undeveloped countries, and to act as a co-ordinating agency between Central Banks.IV. International Conference.The details of the Plan have to be worked out by Special Committees after it has been accepted in principle by the Governments. No doubt the Experts contemplated an International Conference at the next stage, but, as there are some ambiguities in the plan, it may be that it will be necessary to start with a Conference, especially if any of the Governments wish to qualify their acceptance of the Report.V. Points for Decision.Presumably we do not want to challenge the scale of annuities, and, although I have not yet had the views of the Bank of England, I do not imagine that we can -do otherwise than accept the new Bank in principle.But are we to accept the proposed distribution? Or are we to try to insist on a return to the Spa basis, which might in time give us something towards our arrears? If so, should we tell France, Italy and Belgium in advance that, unless they are prepared to fall in with our views on this, it will be quite useless to embark upon a Conference? Finally, if a Conference is to take nla.ce, are we to press for its being held in London ?5 P. S.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, June 20, 1929.
