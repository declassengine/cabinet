I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;b Government.-]       207CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 174,(29).THE YOUNG COMMITTEE REPORT ON REPARATIONS.(A.)-SUMMARY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE REPORT OF THE YOUNG COMMITTEE.THE question of revising the Dawes Plan ,was first raised by Mr. Parker Gilbert, the Agent-General for Reparations, at the end of his published Report of December 1927. He urged the advisability of opening negotiations for this purpose both on the German and the ex-Allied Governments during the Summer and Autumn of 1928. To the Germans he recommended revision on the ground that Germany&apos;s credit cannot be fully restored until a final settlement of reparation has been reached and the foreign controls instituted under the Dawes Plan have been removed. On the Allied Governments he urged that, so long as Germany enjoys the transfer protection provided in the Dawes Plan, she has no inducement to maintain the strict Budget and credit policy necessary to ensure transfers. Mr. Gilbert apparently obtained the cordial support of M. Poincare for his views. The British Government were at first disposed to think that the question of revising the Dawes Plan had been raised prematurely, since the Reparation payments from 1924 onwards had been made with the assistance of American and other foreign loans to Germany, so that experience was not yet available to enable it to be judged how large an annuity Germany could transfer as an unconditional obligation.2. In September 1928, during the sittings of the League of Nations Assembly at Geneva, the German Ministers raised the question of the evacuation of the Rhineland. The French Government had always considered that any evacuation of the Rhineland before the dates fixed by the Treaty must be dependent on some concession by Germany as regards reparation, and British Ministers, while not admitting the justification for this view, had recognised it as a practical factor in the situation. Accordingly, the Ministers at Geneva were led on to a discussion touching on reparation, although no Finance Ministers were present and the ground had been in no way prepared; and the agreement finally reached and announced on the loth September was that there should be parallel discussions about evacuation and about a final settlement of reparation, and that a Committee of Experts should be appointed to draw up proposals for a complete and final settlement of the reparation problem.3. In October 1928 Mr. Gilbert visited Mr. Churchill and discussed the whole position. Mr. Gilbert, while not committing himself to any precise figure, ,as being acceptable to the German Government, expressed confidence that Germany would be found capable of paying an. annuity of  100 millions a year without transfer protection. Mr. Churchill felt that if a settlement on this basis could be reached, it might be regarded as satisfactory since the share of Great Britain (about 20 per cent.), together with our War Debt receipts, would be sufficient to cover our War Debt payments to America ( 33 millions a year until 1932 and  38 millions a year thereafter).Mr. Churchill then visited M. Poincare in Paris to ascertain the views of the French Government and to make sure that their policy gave hope of an agreed settlement. The discussions that took place showed that both Governments regarded it as essential that any final settlement of reparations should provide amounts sufficient to cover the debt liabilities to America although the French Government wanted a surplus, over and above debts, as reparations proper.During the discussion Mr. Churchill pointed out that in any scheme of mobilisation of the German Debt we should expect that the Spa percentages would rule and that France would not have priority of mobilisation in her favour, and [19445]   [19498] b
M. Poincare&quot; made no objection to this. Mr. Churchill also pointed out that an annuity of  100 millions would only cover the British requirements, if the military charges for the occupation of the Rhineland were terminated and the whole of the  100 millions became available for the Creditor Powers.4. Notes were exchanged between the British and French Governments placing on record their standpoints in regard to a final settlement of reparation, and similar notes were shortly afterwards issued by the other Governments concerned and circulated for each other&apos;s information.The main points made in the British Note (delivered on the 4th November) were : (1.) The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is based on the Balfour Note.(2.) The share of reparations payable to the British Dominions and Colonies cannot be counted in the calculation of British receipts for this purpose.(3.) Full cover for our Debt payments in the future should be assured.(4.) Up to the present our payments had exceeded our receipts from reparation and Allied Debts by some  180 millions, and His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;must reserve their right to deal with this deficiency in relation to the claims of the other Creditor Governments to recover any supplementary payments over and above their current Debt liabilities.&quot; (This meant that we were prepared to waive part of our full claim for  180 millions, and the extent to which we were prepared to make sacrifices depended on the sacrifices made by others. But it must be remembered that, even if the Standard Dawes Annuity had continued to be paid and transferred in full, we could only have recovered some  125 millions out of the ;  180 millions.)(5.) Cost of the Armies of Occupation should be brought to an end as soon as possible.(6.) The question of marketing German Bonds appeared to be a question of expediency rather than of principle.The French Note claimed &quot;over and above the means of meeting the liabilities of France to her foreign Creditors during the whole period over which she will have to make payments to them an indemnity enabling her to meet the charges resulting from these war damages.&apos;&apos; The French &apos;&apos; took it for granted that the percentages for the distribution of German payments could not be modified to their disadvantage &quot; in a new settlement.The German Government emphasised the importance of the members of the Committee being independent Financial Experts.The Italian Memorandum claimed that the settlement should &quot;in any case assure the satisfaction of the internal obligations arising from the War Debts for their entire duration,&quot; and also urged &quot;the necessity that German reparations should take into account the costs of the War damages sustained by Italy.&quot; But in an interview with Mr. Churchill on the 1st November, M. Pirelli, the Italian expert, said, while the Italian Government would formally demand a share of reparation over and above debts, this formal demand need not be taken too seriously. (The British Delegation have stated, however, that M. Pirelli&apos;s attitude in Paris was quite different.)The Japanese claimed that the agreed basis of distribution should not be altered in the new settlement.The Belgian Government considered that there could in no case be any question of reducing1 in future arrangements the receipts which they were actually obtaining under the Dawes Plan, and added that thev intended to pursue parallel negotiations with the German Government as regards the claim for compensation for loss on the marks put into circulation in Belgium during the occupation of that country.The Serbian Government claimed (1.) that their agreed share of 5 per cent, should not be reduced, and (2) that the promises made that they should not have to make effective cash payments for the State properties of Austria and Hungary ceded to them should be substantially maintained in a new settlement.6. . There were lengthy discussions as to the exact method of appointing the Committee, but it was finally agreed that the Allied members should be nominated by their own Governments and formally appointed by the Reparation Commission. The agreement on these and other questions of procedure was placed on record in a Communique&quot; of the 22nd December, 1928. and the Committee was formally appointed on the 10th January, 1929, and met on the 9th February, 1929.   The first few weeks
were taken up in discussing the methods of payment of the German annuities, in the hope that, in the meantime, informal conversations would make it easier to approach the question of figures. The discussion on figures had an inauspicious beginning, as each Allied member separately stated the minimum requirements of his Government, and to satisfy these would have required an increase in the full Dawes Annuity of  125 millions to about  150 millions.On the 28th March, Mr. Young proposed a total average* annuity of  105 millions, aifd, after some days of heated discussion, the Allied Experts agreed on an average* annuity of  110 millions for 37 years, with cover for Debts only during the next 22 years. The United Kingdom share of the annuity for the first 37 years was to be sufficient to cover future Debt payments, but contained nothing whatever in respect of past arrears. The circumstances under which the British Experts agreed to this concession in order to avoid a breakdown are explained in Sir J. Stamp&apos;s Memorandum, of the 27th April (CP. 136). Proposals on this basis were made on the 12th April, and on the 17th April the Germans made a counter-proposal for 37 (only) annuities of  82^ millions, of which only  22-1 millions were to be unconditional. On the 7th May, Mr. Owen Young produced a fresh scheme for annuities of the average* value of  102^ millions for 37 years, &quot;with cover for War Debt payments only for the next 22 years. Under this scheme the average* share of the British Empire was reduced to  18 - 35 millions, which meant not only that we should get nothing for the excess payments we had made in the past to America, but also that we should fail to cover even our future Debt payments by the amount of the British Empire share which has to be paid to.the Dominions, &amp;c, namely, about  2^ millions a year. This proposal produced a storm of protest from all shades of opinion in this country, and, in a statement in the House of -Commons, Mr. Churchill, while emphasising the fact that the Government was in no way bound by the recommendations of the independent Experts, made it clear that there could be no chance of any such proposals being accepted by this country. Eventually, fresh proposals for the distribution of the annuity were made, under which the share of the British Empire as an average* for the first 37 years is increased to  20-45 millions, which, while allowing nothing for arrears, is sufficient to cover the Debt payments of Great Britain year by year, and also to permit of the agreed share being paid to the Dominions.(B.)-SUMMARY OF THE EXPERTS&apos; REPORT.I. German Annuities (Part 8 of the Report).(1.) Scale of Annuities [1929-1988).The Dawes Annuity is to continue till the 31st August, 1929, and the new Plan is to come into effect as from the 1st September, 1929. Germany is to pay  37 millions for the broken period, the 1st September, 1929, to the 31st March, 1930, and thereafter 36 Annuities, starting at  85 millions and reaching  120 millions in 1965-6. These (on the 5^ per cent. Tables) are equivalent to 37 Annuities of  99\ millions.In addition to these Annuities, Germany will pay the service of the Dawes Loan of 1924t amounting at present to  4^ millions and decreasing to  3 millions a year by 1949, when this Loan will have been redeemed.For the next 22 years, i.e., 1966 to 1988, Germany is to pay Annuities equivalent to the Allied War Debt payments only; these amount to  80 millions to  85 millions a year, falling to about  45 millions in the last three years.The proposed Annuities are, like the Dawes Annuities, which they replace, to cover reparation and all war charges, but they will constitute the final discharge of all outstanding German obligations.(Note. The Dawes Plan provided for annuities of  125 millions from now onwards, subject to increase through the Index of Prosperity and subject to &quot; transfer protection &quot; as explained below; no period of years was fixed.)_^ * Note. Here and throughout an &quot; average &quot; annuity means the actuarial average on the basis of the 05 per cent, tables; in other words the present value at 5-jjf per cent, interest of 37 annuities of  105 millions would be equal to the present value at 5^ per cent, interest of the 37 annuities actually to be paid year by year. The Young Committee adopted the rate of 5  per cent, on Mr. Young&apos;s suggestion as an estimate of the probable credit of Germany after a settlement over the whole period of 59 years.t The Dawes Loan is a market loan of  40 millions raised by Germany in foreign countries under thf* recommendations of the Dawes Report.
(2.) The Non-postponable and Postponable Annuities (Part 8 (e) and Annex 4). 33 millions a year (to include the service of the Dawes Loan till 1949) are to be paid as an absolute and unconditional obligation in equal monthly instalments in foreign currencies.The remainder of the Annuities are also payable in foreign currencies in equal monthly instalments, but are &quot; postponable.&quot; As regards this part of the Annuities the German Government will have the right to postpone the transfer into foreign currencies of their payments for not more than two years. The Annuities would then be paid in Reichsmarks, which may, in agreement with the Reichsbank, be invested or used for deliveries in kind. The German Government have the further right to postpone the payment in Reichsmarks for one year of 50 per cent, of any sum the transfer of which can be postponed, but only after the postponement of transfers has been in force for one year. This proportion may be increased on the recommendation of the special Advisory Committee of independent financial experts which is to be convoked by the Bank for International Settlements (described in Section III of this Summary) if transfers are postponed.The effect of these provisions may be made clearer by the following illustration. In the year commencing the 1st April, 1940, the German Government has to pay  107^ plus the service of the Dawes Loan, say,  3-^ millions, i.e., a total of  111 millions. Of this total  33 millions has to be paid unconditionally. The remainder,  78 millions, is &quot; postponable,&quot; and the German Government may postpone the transfer into foreign currencies of all or part of this  78 millions for 2 years, i.e., till 1942. Should the German Government avail itself of this right, next.year .(1941) it will only be able to postpone the transfer of this part of the annuity for 1 year, i.e., till 1942, but not later, and thereafter there can be no further postponement till transfers have been resumed and arrears made good to such an extent as to secure that the postponement of transfers never covers more than two years at a time. In addition, if the transfer of the 1940 &quot;postponable&quot; Annuity has been postponed, the German Government may postpone, not only the transfer into foreign currencies, but also the payment in Reichsmarks of 50 per cent, of the 1941 postponable Annuity for one year, i.e., till 1942. . These limited rights of postponement are analogous to, but not identical with, those in the American Debt Funding Agreements.Interest at 1 per cent, above Reichsbank rate (with a maximum of 5J per cent.) is to be paid by Germany on any sum the transfer or payment of which has been postponed and which has not been invested or used for deliveries in kind.If a postponement of Transfers has been declared, or if Germany declares that &apos;&apos; Germany&apos;s exchange and economic life may be seriously endangered &quot; by continued transfers, the Bank for International Settlement is to convene a special Advisory Committee of seven independent experts nominated by the Governors of the Central Banks of Germany, France, England, Belgium, Italy, Japan and the United States of America (with power to co-opt four extra members). This Committee is to investigate and report to the Governments and the Bank, the measures which should be taken; but it is purely &quot;consultative,&quot; and its findings are to have no effective force &quot; unless confirmed and accepted by the Bank as Trustee for the creditors and, if necessary, by the Governments concerned.&quot;(Note. Under the Dawes Plan, Germany discharges her obligations by payments in Reichsmarks, and the &quot;Transfer Committee&quot; was responsible for making transfers into foreign currencies so far as it can without endangering currency stability. Under the new Plan, Germany has to pay in foreign currencies, but she will have certain limited rights of postponing transfers and payment. In that event, the Special Advisory Committee is called into being as an emergency measure, but it has no permanent status or executive functions.)(3.) Revision Clause.In a separate note, not signed by the United States and Japanese Members, it is recommended that, if the Creditor Powers receive any relief in respect of their War Debt liabilities, Germany shall benefit to the extent of two-thirds of the relief during the first 37 years, the Creditor Powers shall retain one-fourth of the relief, and the balance shall be accumulated to help in meeting the last 22 Annuities.During the last 22 years the whole benefit of any relief shall be applied in reduction of the German Annuities.
ft:(4.) Deliveries in Kind (Part 8 (/)).For ten years part of the postponable deliveries have to be taken in deliveries in kind; the amount to be so taken begins at  37-^ millions and decreases yearly to  15 millions in the tenth.year and then ceases. The British Empire share of this part of the annuity is to be 23 per cent, or  8-^ millions in the first year, decreasing to  3-1 millions in, the tenth year. For this purpose, payments under the British Reparation Recovery Act procedure continue to be recognised as deliveries in kind up to the full British Empire share of deliveries, and payments under the French Reparation Recovery Act procedure up to a small part of the French share in deliveries in kind. In the event of a postponement of transfers, deliveries in kind may be specially increased beyond this level. New regulations to simplify the pro-cedure governing Deliveries in Kind are to be made by the existing Committee of the Reparation Commission.(Note. While these provisions do not go so far as we would have wished in the way of stopping the artificial stimulation of German deliveries in kind, they represent an improvement on the present position. There is a growing complaint by British Export Traders at the unfair competition of Deliveries in kind to which preferential Customs, &amp;c, treatment is afforded, and in &quot;particular the system of deliveries in kind has resulted in the loss of the contract for the annual supply of 3 million tons of British coal to the Italian State Railways, which has been a severe blow to the Welsh Coal Mines. Italy&apos;s share of Deliveries is to be  3f millions in the first year, falling to  1-3- millions in the tenth year, and it may be hoped that this will lead to some reduction in the Reparation Coal Deliveries to Italy, at present some 4,800,000 tons a year. But the Italian and German experts agreed to recommend that, if special deliveries in kind are instituted after a suspension 01 transfer, Italy shall have the right to call for reparation coal deliveries up to the amount of  4 millions a year. The British share of Deliveries will be easily covered by the existing Recovery Act procedure, under which we avoid the necessity for taking specific deliveries; it is a procedure whereby the Reichsbank collects and pays over to the British Treasury (in so far as we are entitled to claim it) 26 per cent, of the sterling received in the ordinary course of trade by German exporters, without any disturbance of normal economic transactions. This procedure would enable us to collect  15 millions a year, and we may be asked by the German Government to reduce the percentage of sterling collected by the Reichsbank from German exporters below 26 per cent., as we shall be entitled to only  8^ millions, decreasing annually.)(n.) Sources of Payment (Part 8 (a)).The German Annuities are to be derived (i) as to  33 millions-equal (by a mere coincidence) to the non-postponableAnnuities froni a special tax on the German Railway Company, ranking as a prior charge on the Company and guaranteed by the German Government;(ii) for the rest, from the German Budget.(Note. The Dawes Annuities are derived, half from the German Budget and half from the Railway Bonds, the Industrial Debenture Bonds and the Railway Transport Tax. These Bonds were the main &quot;economic guarantees&quot; which were invented by the Dawes Committee in order to persuade the French Government to evacuate the Ruhr. The present Committee points out that &quot; the basis of security for the payment of the Annuities is the solemn undertaking of the German Govern-ment, to which no further guarantee can add anything whatsoever,&quot; and roundly recommends that all these bonds should be scrapped. This recommendation was at first opposed by the French, Italian and Belgian experts, but was pressed by the British Experts.(6.) Legal Convertibility of the Reichsmark (Part 8).The amount of all payments is to be reckoned in Reichsmarks. The German Government undertake that the Reichsmark, which has been, in fact, convertible into gold or gold exchange since 1924, shall now become and remain so convertible for the purposes of this plan. In a letter (Annex 2) Dr. Schacht further promises to initiate the necessary steps to make the Reichsmark convertible for all purposes.
(7.) Marketing of Bonds.  (Annex 3.)- The Bank for International Settlements is to inform the Creditor Governments (on its own initiative or at their request) when it considers practicable the issue to the public of bonds secured on part of the &quot; unconditional &quot; annuity of  33 millions. It is to fix the minimum price of issues for all markets and to decide on what foreign markets issues are to be made. Each Creditor Government can then either (a) refuse to issue its share and continue to receive the corresponding annuities which rank -pan passu with the service of the marketed bonds, or (6) issue its share in its own country or cede it to the bankers of another country. But if a Creditor Government wishes to issue German Bonds in connection with the conversion of its internal debt (a) the Bank must create such bonds and (b) no minimum price is fixed by the Bank, each Government being free to offer on its own market (on which alone the bonds may be quoted) on whatever terms it can obtain.Germany is to have the right to redeem any part of the Annuities not mobilised at 5J per cent, discount.(Note. Out of the  33 millions of the mobilisable annuity,  4J millions are at the outset required to meet the service of the Dawes Loan; out of the available balance of  28^ millions,  25 millions are to be allocated to France and  2 millions to Italy. These two Governments therefore are the only ones which will have in their possession any substantial amount of bonds available for mobilisation. Bonds secured on the &quot; postponable Annuities &quot; can only be marketed with Germanvs consent.)II. Distribution.(1.) Distribution of the First Thirty-Seven and following Twenty-Two Annuities.The non-German Experts recommend a distribution of the new Annuities &quot; which they consider an inseparable part of the present Report.&quot; They specify the precise sums which should be given to each country concerned in each of the first thirty-seven years; but give no explanation of the method by which this result is reached.The sum allocated to each country during the last twenty-two years is the amount required to cover its war debt payments (plus  2,400,000 a year for the American War Damage claims till 1980).The British, French, Italian, Belgian Governments and the &quot; Minor Allies&quot; receive during the first thirty-seven years cover for their current wrar debt payments year by year (with a comparatively small shortage in the case of Greece and Roumania), leaving the following surpluses over and above current debts available as reparations annually during the first thirty-seven years, viz. : A Year.  France        ... ... ... ... ...      21,000,000British Empire (for the Dominions) ItalyBelgium      ...Serbia        ... ... ...PortugalU.S.A. (with no Debt payments) Japan (with no Debt payments)2,665,000 2,185,000* 3,550,000 3,600,000300,000 3,300,000650,000These surpluses are slightly lower in the fifth to the twelfth years, and in compensation higher during the twenty-first to thirty-seventh years.Accordingly, Great Britain receives (apart from the sum intended for the Dominions) debt cover year by year, i.e., the amount each year which, when added* The Italian surplus is really about  2  millions a year since the distribution basis reckons Italian &quot; War Debt Payments &quot; as including- during the whole 59 years the annual instalments which Italy pays to Great Britain (over and above the debt payments) to repurchase by degrees the gold ( 22-2 millions) deposited in 3 915. Under the Italian War Debt Funding Agreement of 1926 this gold is being repurchased by Italy in instalments between 1928 and 1987. The amount of these instalments is  250,000 a year from 1928-29 to 1931-32 and  382,000 a year from 1933-34 to 1987-88.
to the payments received from France, Italy and our other interallied debtors, will meet our payments year by year to the American Government. The amounts to be thus received under the plan are The share of the Dominions in the German Annuities on the basis of the existing Agreements is  2,665,000 a year; but in order that we may obtain exact debt cover year by year, we shall have to arrange with the Dominions to distribute to them from the fifth to the twelfth years  250,000 a year less than  2,665,000 (i.e.,  2-4 millions), and from the twenty-first to the thirty-seventh year  400,000 a year more than  2,665,000 (i.e.,  3,055,000). On the 5J per cent, tables this will be equivalent to their receiving 37 Annuities of  2,665,000 each. The Report of the Experts allocates a single sum each year to the British Empire as a whole; but it is understood that they regarded this allocation as made up of (a) debt cover for Great Britain, and (&amp;) a reparation surplus for the Dominions and Colonies.In 1985, 1986 and 1987 Great Britain is to make a refund in the following circumstances. As we funded our debt to America three years before the Italian or French settlements, our payments to America cease in 1984, and the sums in 1985 to 1987 are the war debt receipts we should then still be receiving without having any further payments to make to America. We are in this dim future to pay over these excess receipts to the pool, since German payments are limited to net war debt liabilities.(2.) Comparison with Existing Basis.The new method of distribution proposed, which gives to Great Britain only cover for debts, is more favourable to us than the existing (or &quot; Spa &quot;) method of distribution during the fifth to tenth years, but less favourable during the remainingyears.It will be seen from what follows that, &quot;taking the first ten years as a whole, the result of adopting the new method of distribution differs but little from the result of applying the existing system.On the other hand, the United States Government during the first ten years will receive about  3 millions a year instead of  4^ rising to  5 millions a year, which would accrue to her under the existing agreements. The United States Government would lose an aggregate total of some  15 millions during the first ten years by the adoption of the new distribution.The position from the second to the tenth year is given in the following table. No.figures have been inserted for the first year, since it is uncertain what the total receipts (and consequently the Spa share of Great Britain) will be. There will, as on the 31st August, 1929, be a surplus of  11 millions over and above the amounts required to cover debt payments, and a further  4 millions in respect of the Fifth Dawes Annuity would normally be. payable in September 1929. The Report leaves it uncertain whether this  4 millions is to be paid or not, and further leaves the disposal of the surplus to the Governments, but we are informed that there was an understanding with the German experts that this surplus should be returned to Germany. The disposal of the  11 or  15 millions remains, therefore, to be settled, and the total German payments during the year may be anything between  107 million and  88. On the new method of distribution the share of the United Kingdom will be  18-33 million in any event; on the Spa basis, the share of the United Kingdom would vary between  19-85 and  16 millions, giving in the one case a gain of  1^ million and in the other a loss of  2^ million, as compared with the new basis.1929 ...1930 ...1931 ...1932 ...1933-1984 17 to  20 million a year. 18,330,000.  15-6 million.  15-4    .,  15-6    ,,

It is axiomatic that a gain or a loss to us in, say, 1960 is not so important as a gain or a loss of the same amount in 1930. To allow for this, interest tables must be brought in in the normal way to find the present value of future payments, and the question arises what rate of interest should be taken. The Committee of Experts are under-stood to have adopted for the purpose of their calculations a rate of interest of 54? per cent., and consequently this rate is likely to be very frequently heard of in future discussions of this matter.As a starting-point, therefore, a calculation of the annual equivalent of the losses and gains of all the countries for the 37 years has been computed on the b\ per cent, tables.  The results of this calculation are found to be as follows : *Annual Equivalent (on the 5^ per Cent. Basis) of the Annuities distributable to the several Countries in accordance with (i) the existing (&quot;Spa&quot;) Method and (ii) the New Method proposed.(i.) Existing (ii.)

Others99,400,000 99,400,000*These figures relate to the distribution of the payments made from the 1st September, 1929, onwards. They therefore ignore the fact that the Committee has recommended that the payments between the 1st April and the 31st August, 1929, should be redistributed so as to cover Debt payments. It is assumed in what follows that the whole of the surplus over and above Debt payments is returned to
This calculation has been made on the 5^ per cent, tables for the reason stated; it shows a loss to Great Britain of  2,400,000 a year. But of course the rate of calculation which should be taken is largely a matter of opinion and if, in view of the economic and political uncertainties surrounding the future of debts and reparations, the 1\ per cent, tables were taken, the result would be to reduce our loss to a figure in the region of SA\ million.Apart from the loss to Great Britain and the United States of America and the gains to Italy, Belgium and France, the changes between the existing and the new Distribution are very slight; thus the Dominions and the &quot;Minor Allies&quot; receive much the same under the new Distribution as they would receive under the old.(3.) Transition Year (Part 8 and xAnnex 7).The Report has left the transitional arrangements rather obscure. The receipts of the period the 1st April, 1929, to the 31st August, 1929, under the Dawes Plan are to be &quot; redistributed to the extent necessary to provide each Power with cover for its net debt outgoings during the year ended the 31st March, 1930.&quot; These total  43 millions, of which the liability of Great Britain is  18-33 millions. The disposal of any surplus over and above debts and costs of occupation and other transitional charges &quot;shall be settled and adjusted between the Governments.&quot;The new Plan starts with a payment of  37 million for the period the 1st September, 1929, to the 31st March, 1930, which is to be devoted solely to reparation surpluses.Thus, the debt cover is received solely in the first five months and the reparation surplus solely in the last seven months.We shall actually have received  13-5 million up to the 31st August and will require  18-33 million for the whole year, so that we shall have to recover  5 million from the other Creditors by redistribution. How this is to be arranged is left to the Governments to settle.The arrangement as to the surplus this year is equally obscure. The Dawes receipts for the remainder of the fifth Dawes year (including the  4 million normally payable in September 1929) are estimated at  58 millions, while the debt outgoings are  43 millions; there is thus a surplus of  15 millions &quot;to be settled and adjusted.&quot;(Note. Members of the American Group who negotiated this part of the Plan informed the British Experts that it was part of the bargain that this surplus should be repaid to Germany. This is not, however, stated in the Plan, and it is not impossible that the French, and also the American, Governments may find reasons against it. The surplus will be mostly held by France, Belgium, Serbia and the United States of America.)Germany and that the amount of  5 millions, which has to be paid to Great Britain to make up our requirements for Debt cover, is contributed by the other Governments which have received more than their Debt cover. (In other words, such Govern-ments would surrender this surplus partly to Great Britain and partly to Germany). Taking account of this factor, the annual equivalent on the 5^ per cent, basis of the losses or gains of the various Governments are as follows :  ^ YearUnited KingdomDominions ...FranceItalyBelgiumU.S.A.Otherslosslossgaingaingainlossloss 2,215,000 30,000 403,000 1,840,000 592,000 506,000 84,000The above are corrected figures. The discrepancy between them and the figures given in CP., 160 (29) is due to the discovery of certain errors in the calculations of the Experts Committee.
(4.) Distribution   of   the   &quot;Unconditional&quot;   or   &quot;Mobilisable&quot;   Annuities   of  33 Millions (Annex 7 and Annex 8). 4-1 millions (decreasing to  3 millions by 1949 and then ceasing) is required for the service of the Dawes Loan. Of the balance,  25 million is allocated to France, but France enters into the following undertakings: If bonds representing any part of the unconditional annuity allocated to France are marketed, she will deposit 10 per cent, of the proceeds in foreign currencies with the Bank for Inter-national settlements (which will pay interest at the maximum rate for long-term deposits) until  25 millions has been deposited. Similarly, if at any time the special Advisory Committee is convened [i.e., if transfers are suspended or threatened to be suspended) France will deposit  25 millions or such sum as may be necessary to bring her total deposit to that figure. If transfers are, in fact, suspended, the Bank will offer to the Creditors, other than France, foreign currencies out of this deposit up to the amount necessary to ensure to each the amounts they would have received had the non-postponable Annuity been distributed in the same proportions as the total annuity.(Note. Under this arrangement Great Britain ought to receive the same share -of the actual annuities transferred as if she had been allocated her due proportion (17-7 per cent, on the Committee&apos;s basis) of the mobilisable annuities, and we should not be damnified by the allocation of nearly all the mobilisable annuities to France and of most of the balance to Italy, provided that any suspension of payments is, in fact, limited to two years as the plan proposes.)As regards the balance of the mobilisable Annuity (at first  3^ millions and eventually, after 1949, when the Dawes Loan ceases,  8 millions), Italy is to receive  2 millions; the apportionment of the rest is left to be settled by the Governments.(5.) Belgian Marks Claim.The German Government have agreed to negotiate with the Belgian Government direct in regard to the Belgian claim for loss in regard to the marks (5^ milliards, nominally  275 million) put into forced circulation at the pre-war rate of 1-25 francs to the Mark during the German occupation. The Belgian Government are to receive  650,000 a year for this claim within the Annuities, but claim  1J millions additional outside the Annuities of  99^ million. The Experts &quot; recognise that the new Plan cannot become operative until the Belgian and German&quot; Governments have come to an internationally binding agreement on the Mark Claim.&quot; This Belgian claim has not hitherto been accepted as valid by the other creditor Governments.(6.) Waiver of Adjustments for Past Transactions.The distribution proposed should be &quot; a final settlement of all questions relating to the distribution of German payments, and should not be affected by any existing arrangements or &quot;by the result of accounts relating to past transactions &quot; (Annex 7, paragraph 5).This means that Great Britain will not have to account to the Reparation Pool for the surplus of the proceeds of liquidating German property after meeting British claims chargeable thereon. The surplus already realised is estimated to amount to at least  9 millions, of which  7-1 millions have already been paid to the Exchequer. This provision is, therefore, of considerable importance to the Treasury.As stated below, the Committee recommend that further liquidation should riease.III. The Bank for International Settlements (Part 6 and Annex 1).1. The Reparation Commission and the Agent-General for Reparation payments are to be entirely superseded by the Bank for International Settlements (B.I.S.), and the foreign Directors of the Reichsbank, the German Railway Company and the Bank of Industrial Debentures in fact, all Allied control over internal German affairs are to. be discontinued. The control over the &quot; Assigned Revenues &quot; (Customs, Tobacco and Sugar) is to be simplified (in agreement with the bondholders of the Dawes Loan, which has the first charge on these revenues).
Functions of the Bank.2. (1.) To receive and distribute the Annuities, after meeting (a) the Service of the Dawes Loan; (&amp;) the BaniVs expenses and remuneration; (c) any sums which they decide to withhold being guided &quot; on the one hand by the need for prompt action in the interest of the creditor countries, and on the other by the interests of the Plan as a whole, including due consideration to the Bank by way of compensation for its services in managing the annuity.&quot;(2.) To co-ordinate and control the commercialisation of the German debt, i.e., the sale of Bonds secured on the non-postponable Annuities.(3.) To direct, control and give credit to purchasers of Deliveries in Kind, especially for Public Works.(4.) To grant credit to Germany in order to avoid transfer difficulties.(5.) To invest Reichsmark payments during periods of postponement of transfers.(6.) To convoke the Special Advisory Committee if transfers are postponed.(7.) To increase world trade by financing projects, particularly in undeveloped countries.(8.) To act as a co-ordinating agency between Central Banks. Organisation.3. Capital.  20 million ( 5 million called up). To be issued in Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, Japan and United States of America in equal portions and each issue to be guaranteed by the Central Bank concerned. (But  800,000 for each country and  8,800,000 in all out of the first issue may, by agreement, be issued in other countries on a gold basis.) Shares to carry no voting rights, which will be held by the Central Banks only.Taxation. The funds and investments of the Bank to be freed from double taxation by a Special International Convention.This would require legislation here and elsewhere.Directors. -The 7 Governors of the above named Central Banks (or theirnominees).7 Persons appointed by these Governors.   -2 additional nominees (if desired) by the Governors of the banks of Germany and France respectively. Up to 9 members co-opted from Lists by Governors of other central banks (who may include themselves in the list).   .25 (maximum).(If any Governor of a Central Bank will not serve or nominate, the other Directors may appoint substitutes. It is believed that Messrs. J. P. Morgan are willing to act in the case of America.)Receipts and Investments of the Bank.4. The Bank&apos;s assets apart from its paid up capital of  5 millions will consist of the Annuity payments, of deposits by Central Banks (if they so desire) of the interest-bearing Guarantee Fund of not. more than  25 million to be deposited by France if transfers are suspended or if the unconditional annuity is mobilised and the non-interest-bearing deposit by Germany equal to 50 per cent, of the average deposit remaining in the Annuity Trust Account, not to exceed  5 million.*The Bank may invest these receipts in approved Bills, Discounts, securities, &amp;c.It can borrow in foreign currencies against Annuity payments, of which the transfer has been postponed and distribute the proceeds to the Creditor Powers and (by two-thirds majority) issue its own obligations and lend the proceeds to any Central Bank.* There is said to have been an understanding that the Creditor Powers would be asked to allow an interval (5 weeks or so) to elapse between tho receipt of the Annuities by the Bank and their distribution, so as to allow a floating balance of about  10 millions.(As Auxiliary and permissive functions) : 
Its activities in any Country must receive the consent of the Central Bank of that Country. It must not &quot;exercise a predominant influence over business interests in any Country.&quot;Reserve.5. 40 per cent, in gold or gold exchange against deposits payable on demand (to be modified by two-thirds majority).Distribution of Profits.6. (1.) 5 per cent, to Legal Reserve Fund till it equals 10 per cent, of paid-up Capital.(2.) 6 per cent, cumulative dividend.(3.) 20 per cent, of the remainder to shareholders until dividend of 12 per cent. is reached.(4.) 50 per cent, of balance to General Reserve till it equals paid-up capital and thereafter a diminishing percentage. (5.) Of the balance left (a) 75 per cent, to Governments or Central Banks which maintain time deposits at the Bank,ib.) 25 per cent, to German Government to assist in paying the last 22 annuities if they elect to make a Time Deposit of  20 million (or less than 25 per cent, if the Deposit is smaller).(The understanding is said to have been that the Germans undertook to try to make this Deposit in about 5 or 8 years.)Detailed Scheme.7. A Committee of 14, 2 to be appointed by each of the above Central Banks, is to frame a Charter and Statutes for the Bank and to work out the scheme in detail. The proposals in the Report are intended only as an outline.IV. Miscellaneous .Liquidation of the Past.1. The putstanding accounts between Germany and the Reparation Corn-mission now obsolete should be closed.2. The Creditor Experts recommend that unsettled claims by Germany in respect of past transactions should be waived.(Note.: rThis, no doubt, would coyer claims against the Armies of Occupation for rents, damages, &amp;c, and would save a great deal of work and make evacuation quicker; but the German Experts refused to commit themselves to the recom-mendation, and the matter will have to be settled at the Conference.)3. No further liquidations of German property should take place from the date of the acceptance, and all outstanding questions cleared up within a year.(Note. This means the British Exchequer losing some  1^ millions this financial year, plus some  1 million dependent on the result of litigation now proceeding in the American Courts. But the Budget Estimate of  3 millions for Clearing Office surplus migl^t be fulfilled, in spite of this loss^ as the estimate was on the conservative side. Presumably, liquidation should continue until the Report has been formally accepted, but the German Government may press for liquidation to be discontinued after the Report has been accepted in principle. It will require a special arrangement with the German Government (including an indemnity for past transactions) before we can hand over any properties not liquidated.)4. Questions connected with non-German reparation, such as the debts of the Succession States to the Reparation Pool for Ceded Properties, &amp;c, should be dealt with within a year.
Armies of Occupation.The Committee say that in the proposed Annuities they &quot; have not included the Costs of Commissions and the current expenses of Occupation, as they are to continue only until a date to be fixed by the Governments. The necessary arrangements for their payment should be made by the Governments in connection with the adoption of the new Plan.&quot;,    . .    ...... .... ....... -: .   .(Note.-On the scheme of distribution recommended by the Committee the Dawes payments till the 31st August, 1929, will cover the cost of the Armies of Occupation to that date and leave a surplus of  15 millions (less the cost of liquidating the existing arrangements). The German Government will presumably expect the Rhineland to be evacuated by the 1st September next and this surplus to be returned to them; but it seems uufortunate that the Committee were not able definitely to contemplate tbe evacuation of the Rhineland by the 1st September next, or at least to stipulate that if the Occupation were maintained beyond that date, the costs should be defrayed by the occupying Powers and not charged to Germany. But the French Experts would not agree to anything on these lines.)Procedure for ptitting the Plan into Force (Annex 5).Once the Governments have accepted in principle the new Plan, steps should be taken (as a preparation for the International Conference) for the elaboration of detailed schemes by &quot; Organisation Committees.&quot;The Organisation Committee for the Bank to be appointed by the Governors of the seven Central Banks. The Organisation Committee for the adaptation of the German Laws under the Dawes Plan to be appointed by the Reparation Commission and the German Government with 3 sub-committees (each 2 Germans and 2 Allies) on (1) the Assigned Securities, (2) the Bank Law, (3) the Railway Law.After the Governments have made a comprehensive agreement for putting the Plan into force, the Organisation Committee for the Bank to set up the organisation provided by the new Plan.The transfer of the functions of the existing organisation to the Bank for International Settlements to be undertaken by a special Committee, namely, two members of the Bank for International Settlements Organisation Committee, and representatives of the German Government, the AgentrGeneral and the Reparation Commission.o
