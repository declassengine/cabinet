I This Document ia the Property of Hia Britannic Majegty&apos;s Government.]    288Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1929.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 181 (29).CABINET.24fj 1747/5/16] -MEMORANDUM ON EGYPT.[Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.]THE first Egyptian Parliament elected  after the  promulgation  of  the Constitution in 1923 met in the early days of the following year.   The followers of Zaghlul Pasha, the so-called &quot; Waf d &quot; party, had an overwhelming majority, and Feb. 1924. Zaghlul himself became Prime Minister.2. After his abortive conversations with Mr. Ramsay MacDonald in England in the autumn of 1924, Zaghlul returned to Egypt with, considerably lessened prestige and was almost immediately confronted by a domestic crisis. Political elements, &apos; whose allegiance to the Wafd was by no means whole-hearted, were showing signs of revolt and were being encouraged by King Fuad. To re-establish, his authority, Zaghlul forced a crisis by tendering his resignation, whilst the King was successfully Oot 1924 intimidated by a well-drilled mob, which called for &quot; Zaghlul or revolution&quot; before Abciin Palace. These manoeuvres were successful, and the position of the Govern-ment seemed to be consolidated, when on the 19th. November the Governor-General of the Sudan, Sir Lee Stack, was murdered in the streets of Cairo.3. This outrage marked in Egypt the culmination of a campaign of political assassination, in which eleven British subjects had lost their lives, and which was causing increasing uneasiness amongst the European communities and responsible Egyptian circles. In the Sudan it followed on a series of deliberate attempts to excite disaffection and disturb the peace, which has led Mr. MacDonald on the 4th October to issue a serious warning of what the consequences would be if this course were persisted in, cf. Appendix II. It was decided to address an ultimatum to the Egyptian Government demanding, inter alia, the pursuit and condign punishment of the criminals, the suppression of manifestations which were designed to generate political excitement, and the removal of the Egyptian army from the Sudan. The actual terms of the ultimatum as delivered differ from those approved by His Majesty5s Government, as Lord Allenby was obliged to act without waiting for the latter text owing to ZaghluFs intention to resign office, and thus avoid responsibility for the situation which the ultimatum would produce. As it Was, ZaghluTs Govern-ment accepted some of the terms of the ultimatum and refused or evaded the rest. Lord Allenby thereupon seized the Alexandria customs and the Government resigned.4. A new Cabinet under Ziwar Pasha took office with the avowred intention of Bee. 1924. restoring good relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Immediate effect was given to the demand for the withdrawal of the Egyptian troops from the Sudan, notes were exchanged in regard to the position of the Financial and Judicial Advisers, and arrangements were concerted for the reference of the question of the distribution of the Nile waters (which, had been raised by a demand in Lord Allenby&apos;s ultimatum for the abandonment of the limitation hitherto imposed on the amount.of water to be taken by the Sudan) to an Anglo-Egyptian Commission under a neutral chairman. The customs were released less than a week after their seizure. The actual perpetrators of Sir Lee Stack&apos;s murder were eventually discovered, tried and executed in the course of the summer of 1925.5. On taking office, Ziwar had first prorogued and subsequentlv dissolved 1925 Parliament. Fresh elections were held in February and March, and Parliament met on the 23rd March, 1925. To the general surprise, Zaghlul was elected President &quot;f the Chamber, and the King, on Ziwar&apos;s advice, immediately dissolved the newly ejected Parliament. The Cabinet was at this time composed of a coalition of Liberal-Constitutionalists and Ittehadists or members of the newly organised Royalist party, ihis coalition held together until September, when the Liberals seceded while Ziwar was absent in Europe, as a result of a quarrel between the protagonists of the two Parties in the Cabinet over a relatively trivial incident in which the sympathies of King Fuad obviously inclined to the Ittehadists.6.   In October 1925 Lord Lloyd succeeded Lord Allenby as High Commissioner. un the 8th December a new electoral law was promulgated, against Lord Lloyd&apos;s 4940   [19487] &apos; ^ b
advice, restricting the franchise to males over 30 years of age and to those between 25 and 30 possessing certain educational or property qualifications. The Opposition parties, viz., the Watanists or Extreme Nationalists, the Zaghlulist Wafd, and the Liberals, at once declared their intention to boycott elections held under it.&apos; In view 1926. of their uncompromising attitude, the Government yielded, and, after consulting the senate, held elections on the 22nd May under a law which had been passed by the 1924. Parliament but not actually promulgated before its dissolution, i.e., on a basis of universal manhood suffrage.7. The result of these elections was a foregone conclusion, in view of which Lord Lloyd asked for authority to support King Fuad in refusing to allow Zaghlul himself to assume office as Prime Minister. His Majesty&apos;s Government at^fhst demurred strongly to this proposal, on the ground that it would be an interference in the internal affairs of Egypt unprovided for by the declaration of 1922 and unlikely to commend itself to public opinion at home; but eventually they reluctantly yielded to Lord Lloyd&apos;s insistence. The latter had an interview with Zaghlul and made it plain that his assumption of office would not be favourably viewed by His Majestys Government. In the end Zaghlul yielded and accepted the presidency of the Chamber, leaving Adly Pasha to form a Cabinet of Wafdists and Liberals, the former being in the majority.  Parliament was opened on the 10th June.8. Shortly before .the resignation of the Ziwar Government, Lord Lloyd had been anxious to strengthen the position of the British Inspector-General and other British officers in the Egyptian army, in return for which he would have been prepared to agree to the appointment of an Egyptian Sirdar (or Commander-in-chief) to succeed Sir Lee Stack. The latter had (like his predecessor) held that office concurrently with the Governor-Generalship of the Sudan. Lord Lloyd made private suggestions in this sense to the King and Ziwar, but was unable to get the latter to give effect to them before his resignation.9. Discussion had also been taking place early in 1926 between the Foreign Office and Lord Lloyd on the subject of the employment of foreign officials in the Egyptian service. The majority of such officials were due to retire in the near future with compensation under the terms of a settlement negotiated in 1923, and the question arose as to how far it would be possible (a) to prevent a considerable increase in the proportion of non-British as compared with British amongst the foreign officials with whose services no Egyptian Government could dispense, and (b) to insist on the retention of British officials in certain services. A Foreign Office suggestion that we should press no demand under (b) above provided that the retiring British officials were replaced by Egyptians, and should only require under (a) the maintenance, of, say, the 1914 proportion between British and non-British foreign officials, was rejected by Lord Lloyd. His view was that the Foreign Office proposal would involve an important modification both of the terms of the 1922 declaration and of the policy laid down as recently as October 1925, when it had been decided that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have the right to expect that the Egyptian Govern-ment ^yhen they need foreign assistance in their administration will employ British subjects.&quot;10.   The Egyptian Parliament continued sitting till the 20th September, and were occupied chiefly with the budget and a certain amount of domestic legislation. July 1926.     Zaghlul, as President of the Chamber, exercised a moderating influence and generally supported the Government.   Lord Lloyd, while on leave in July, had secured the following decision of the Cabinet: &quot; (a.) That we should stand firmly to the present position, and not allow any weakening of our authority in Egypt.&quot; (b.) That we should stand by all &quot;those who have stood by us in Egypt.&quot; (c.) That we should insist on a renewal of the contracts of British officials (many of which expire in the spring of 1927) until after the settlement of the four reserved points (in the declaration of the 2Sth February, 1922, terminating the Protectorate, cf. Appendix I), and should seek-gradually to replace British officials in some key posts which in recent years have been alhywed to be given to persons of other than British or Egyptian nationality.&quot; (d.) That, when we make a definite demand on Egypt, we should insist on its being carried out.&quot; (e.) That we should do our utmost to avoid an application by Egypt tor admission as a member of the League of Nations, and that this object should be secured, if possible, by action at Cairo.&quot;
Paragraph (e) above was prompted by a passage in King Fuad&apos;s speech opening the Egyptian Parliament in June, stating that the Government intended to take leasures to secure the admission of Egypt to the League.  In the event the Egyptian Government were dissuaded without much difficulty from applying for membership.Paragraph (c) was obviously calculated to produce a difficult situation. By an agreement negotiated in 1923, Egypt had acquired the right to dispense with  the services of foreign officials, and had paid special compensation in this connexion amounting to over  6 million.11.   On his return to Egypt, Lord Lloyd proposed to take the matter up with the Egyptian Government and insist on the retention of British officials, and in some instances on a considerable addition to their existing numbers, in most departments of the Egyptian Government.   In the resulting correspondence it became clear that there was a complete divergence of aim between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Feb. 1927. High Commissioner.  All that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to press for was the retention of the strict minimum of essential British officials in the minimum number of departments, obviously covered by the 1922 reserved subjects.   In their view, it was much more essential to obtain in some form an effective assurance that the Egyptian Government would not, without the prior consent of the Residency, engage non-British foreign officials.  This was a definite departure from the Cabinet decision of July 1926, and a reversion to Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s own policy, as defined in a memorandum which he circulated to the Cabinet in January 1925, and !n which he said:  &quot;But my policy is to avoid annexation not to govern Egypt, ut to leave the Egyptians to govern it, whilst securing sufficient power to protect hose interest of which we are the guardians.&quot;  Meanwhile, Lord Lloyd had spared 0 effort to secure the renewal of the contracts of as many British officials as possible &apos;n every department.   The Egyptian Government, however, were well aware of the trength of their position; they also realised how indispensable the services of many f the officials were, and they decided to renew for varying periods the contracts of 0 less than 506 officials, or 85 per cent., and there is reason to believe that this umber would not have been much smaller had Lord Lloyd refrained  from ntervention.   As it was, he failed altogether to secure any assurance of the kind desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the engagement of non-British oreign officials.12. Telegrams received from Lord Lloyd on the 4th March, made it appear that a risis was on the point of arising in connexion with the apparent intention of the gyptian Government to pass legislation which would have the effect of so greatly ncreasing the numerical strength of the Egyptian army as to constitute a menace to ur position; at the same time determined efforts were being made to deprive the nspector-General and acting Sirdar of all effective authority and prestige. Lord loyd stated that the Egyptian army had now become a crucial point in Anglo-gyptian relations and the issue was one which His Majesty&apos;s Government could no onger shelve. He therefore proposed to restore the powers and prestige of the nspector-General by insisting on the Egyptian Government recognising his right 0 the powers of acting Sirdar and conferring on him higher military rank and ncreased salary. He also proposed to insist on the appointment of a senior British fficer as assistant Inspector-General and on the Frontier Districts administration ing placed under the Inspector-General. These measures, together with the retention-ion of the posts already occupied by British officers, would, in Lord Lloyd&apos;s opinion, afeguard our position and enable us to acquiesce in a slight increase in the numbers f the Egyptian army, the reduction of the period of service and consequent increase n the trained reserves, and the development of a military air service. The view aken by the Foreign Office was that if a crisis was inevitable &quot; whatever policy we adopt will have to be carried through to success. It must therefore be so obviously easonable and constructive that it will not only be immune from serious criticism t home but will justify recourse to extreme measures to enforce it. The mere sistence on strengthening the British element in the Egyptian army by itself would ot fulfil this condition and would be unlikely to prove effective for long. Something roader is wanted.&quot; This, in the Foreign Office view, might be found in a modus ivendi with Egypt under which pending, and without prejudice to, a final settle-ent, the British, and Egyptian forces would co-operate in the joint task of ensuring the common interest the defence of Egypt and, as a corollary, in maintaining the gyptian army as an efficient and reliable force. This provoked a very long corres-ndence with Lord Lloyd, which showed that his conception of British policy as efined in the 1922 declaration differed fundamentally from that of the Foreign Office. [19487] b 2
In his view, the 1922 declaration was in essence vis-a-vis Egypt &quot;negative and prohibitive,&quot; whereas the Foreign Office held that the policy of 1922 was to settle by-agreement with Egypt the subjects which in those stormy days were incapable of settlement and had to be reserved in consequence : this attitude Lord Lloyd regarded as &quot; positive and permissive,&quot; and as such to be rejected. In the end the Cabinet decided on the 13th April to accept Lord Lloyd&apos;s proposals. May 1927. 13   Nothing happened for a month when Lord Lloyd put his proposals to theEgyptian Prime Minister. The latter at first seemed inclined to regard them as acceptable provided Zaghlul could be induced to fall in with them; subsequent reports from Lord Lloyd made it appear that the chances of an amicable solution were rapidly disappearing and on the 25th May he requested authority to present his requirements in the form of a note to the Egyptian Government. This he was authorised to do but the wording of the note was made more friendly on instructions from the Foreign Office and a passage included in which it was suggested that the best solution would be found in the conclusion of a provisional military agreement between Great Britain and Egypt and that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared at once to negotiate a settlement on these lines. The note as amended was handed to the Prime Minister on the 30th May. In his subsequent telegrams Lord Lloyd discussed the action to be taken in the event of the Egyptian Government rejecting the note, a contingency which he regarded as increasingly likely. On the 3rd June the Egyptian reply was received. Lord Lloyd described it as an attempt at a compromise between the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Wafd respectively and regarded it as evasive, equivocal and inadequate. He therefore proposed to address a virtual ultimatum to the Egyptian Government calling for the acceptance of his requirements within forty-eight hours. To this His Majesty&apos;s Government would not agree. They did not regard the Egyptian note as wholly unsatisfactory, and in their reply they desired to revert to the provisional military agreement which they had already declared themselves ready to negotiate and of which they now put forward a draft. To this procedure Lord Lloyd took strong exception, and in spite of explicit instruc-tions to communicate with the Egyptian Prime Minister in the sense desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government, he was still arguing when on the 12th June Sarwat Pasha, who in April had succeeded Adly Pasha as Prime Minister, himself proposed a way out of the deadlock by a partial acceptance of Lord Lloyd&apos;s original demands. This the latter was eager to accept and he was authorised to do so by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. Thus ended a crisis which, largely artificial in its inception, had seriously threatened our whole relations with Egypt and very nearly undone the work of reconciliation which had been in progress for five years since the declaration of 1922.14. At the end of June King Euad sailed for Europe, and arrived in London on a State visit, accompanied by Sarwat Pasha, during the first week in July. The latter had a long conversation with the Secretary of State, and was so much impressed by what Sir Austen Chamberlain said to him that five days later he produced a draft of a Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Egypt. This draft, which was largely an adaptation of the proposals of the Milner Mission in 1920, was such a great advance on the attitude hitherto taken up by Egyptian statesmen that it called for the most careful consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government. A counter-draft was prepared, in which the requirements of the War Office and the High Commissioner found ample expression. This was communicated to Sarwat Pasha, who at the end of August submitted his comments upon it. In the meantime, Zaghlul Pasha, who latterly had been in failing health, died, and Sarwat Pasha returned to Egypt in the early part of September, though he does not appear to have taken his colleagues or Nahas Pasha, who now became leader of the Wafd, into his confidence regarding his negotiations. Sarwat returned to London in October and resumed his conversations with Sir Austen Chamberlain, which eventually resulted in a text of a treaty being agreed between them. In November King Fuad, Lord Lloyd and Sarwat Pasha all returned to Egypt, and the Egyptian Parliament was reopened. Nahas Pasha was elected President of the Chamber in succession to Zaghlul.15. After his return to Egypt Sarwat evidently realised that the text of the draft treaty which he had agreed to was in advance of Egyptian opinion, and that without Zaghlul, whose immense prestige and authority would have sufficed to make almost any settlement acceptable, the rejection of his own agreement was certain. The attitude of King Fuad was ambiguous; he had always disliked and mistrusted the Liberals as the authors of the constitution which stood in the way oi jus autocratic ambitions, and Sarwat felt with reason that he could not rely upon Ins support; inside the Cabinet there were quarrels and friction.   In the midst of these
difficulties Sarwat played for time, took no one into his confidence regarding the actual terms of the draft treaty, and sought rather to secure eleventh-hour modifications, or, at least, interpretations of certain passages.16. Early in the New Year Lord Lloyd reported the likelihood of the passage ig28. through Parliament of legislation the so-called Assemblies Bill-which, in his opinion and that of the Egyptian authorities responsible for the maintenance of order, would make their task impossible. There were increasing signs in Egypt of irritation at the mystery in which Sarwat continued to envelope his negotiations. His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious for publicity, and kept pressing Sarwat to take his colleagues into his confidence. In the meantime Lord Lloyd reported that Nahas, who by then had been made aware of the terms of the treaty, had informed him on the 26th February that it was useless to discuss &quot; what advantages might or might not be afforded Egypt in various clauses of the treaty, inasmuch as the treaty clearly failed to provide for the complete evacuation of Egyptian territory by the British army.&quot; Finally, on the 4th March, Sarwat informed Lord Lloyd that his Government were unable to accept the treaty, and he himself resigned shortly after. The treaty was published by His Majesty&apos;s Government as a White Paper, together with the relevant correspondence. Lord Lloyd was anxious that an opportunity should be taken of stating publicly that the treaty as an offer of alliance must be regarded as withdrawn, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government was therefore compelled to fall back on the strict observance of the declaration of 1922 and the ultimatum of 1924. It was, however, decided that this was unnecessary, and that the memorandum already communicated to Sarwat Pasha (and published in the White Paper) was sufficient. This memorandum concluded with the sentence : &quot; But now that the Egyptian Government have declined to sign the treaty negotiated with Sarwat Pasha, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot permit the discharge of any of their responsibilities under the Declaration of the 28th February, 1922, to be endangered, whether by Egyptian legislation of the nature indicated above (cf. first sentence of this paragraph) or by administrative action, and they reserve the right to take such steps as in their view the situation may demand.&quot;17. On Sarwafs resignation Nahas Pasha assumed the premiership. On the March 1928. 30th March he delivered to Lord Lloyd in reply to the memorandum referred to in the preceding paragraph a note in which he challenged the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to intervene in the internal affairs of Egypt. Three days later Lord Lloyd telegraphed that Nahas Paslia&apos;s action had been taken with the knowledge of only one of his colleagues and under pressure from the King on the one hand and from his own more extreme followers on the other. The rest of the Cabinet, who were only informed after the delivery of the note, were both surprised and angry. On the 5th April Lord Lloyd communicated to Nahas the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in which they reasserted their rights under the 1922 declaration  &quot; The position to-day is, therefore, the same as when the MacDonald-Zaghlul negotiations broke down. The reserved points remain reserved to the absolute discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Egyptian Government exercising its independent authority subject to satisfying His Majesty&apos;s Government on these matters.&quot; The text of these notes was published. It now became necessary to decide what action should be taken if, in spite of these warnings, the Egyptian Government decided to proceed with the enactment of the Assemblies Bill. In that event Lord Lloyd considered that there would be nothing for it but to ask King Fuad to dismiss the Nahas Government and dissolve Parliament. This was precisely the course which the Foreign Office were most anxious to avoid. In telegraphing in this ense to Lord Lloyd on the 18th April, Sir Austen Chamberlain said : &apos;&apos; King Fuad has long aimed at bringing about a situation in which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be obliged to break the pledge given in 1922 and tear up the Egyptian Constitution. This is not what we are aiming at. We do not desire to tear up the Egyptian Constitution, but to discredit the Wafd Ministry Avhich has challenged us on one of the most important reserved points, i.e.y the security of foreigners in Egypt. It is a trap His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto successfully avoided, and it remains one of the objects of our policy to avoid getting into the position of being blackmailed by the best hated and least trusted man in Egypt, whose object it is to use His Majesty&apos;s Government as the instrument of an attack on the liberties of his subjects. If these liberties are to be curtailed, King Fuad must take the initiative himself.&quot;
Bill, a note was communicated to them on the 29th April calling upon Nahas Pasha as head of the Egyptian Government, immediately to take the necessary steps to prevent the Bill becoming law and to give an assurance that the measure would not be proceeded with. A reply within three days was demanded. The Egyptian reply undertook to postpone the examination of the Bill until the next session. In effect this meant that the Bill was dead, and, though Lord Lloyd was anxious to proceed to extreme measures, His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the Egyptian reply and contented themselves with again reasserting emphatically their position in regard to the 1922 declaration. Nahas was so thankful to escape from his predicament that he thanked Sir Austen Chamberlain almost effusively for the conciliatory and friendly spirit which had inspired the happy solution of the crisis. The object of His Majesty&apos;s Government had been abundantly achieved; a dangerous and unwanted measure had been knocked on the head, and the folly and incompetence of Nahas June 1928. Pasha brought home to Egyptian opinion. Within six weeks four of his colleagues resigned, and on the 25th June King Fuacl dismissed Nahas and called upon Mohamed Mahmoud to form a Cabinet.19. Mahmoud Pasha took office at the end of June with a Ministry predominantly Liberal-Constitutional in political colour, though it contained several Ittehadists and one member who had hitherto been associated with the Wafd. Parliament was adjourned for a month and subsequently dissolved on the 19th July. The article of the Constitution imposing fresh elections within a month of a dissolution was at the same time suspended. In an explanatory statement signed by all the members of the Cabinet it was made clear that in thus interfering with the Constitution it was not intended to strike at the parliamentary system nor the principle of ministerial responsibility.20. On the 22nd September Sarwat Pasha died suddenly and unexpectedly in Paris. At the end of October the Acting High Commissioner reported that King Fuad was once again about to provoke a crisis with a view to getting rid of the Prime Minister, and that if His Majesty&apos;s Government held aloof he would probably succeed. His Majesty&apos;s Government held that so long as the reserved subjects were not encroached on, constitutional issues were a matter for King Fuad and the Egyptian people. In accordance with this principle, His Majesty&apos;s Government had refrained from intervention in the crisis leading to the dismissal of the Nahas Government and the subsequent suspension, of the parliamentary regime. In the present case, however, Egyptian opinion would probably resent abstention from interference when such abstention would be tantamount to allowing King Fuad. whom His Majesty&apos;s Government had placed on the Egyptian throne, to plunge the country into turmoil for a caprice suggested by his wish to establish a personal autocracy. Internal reform and improved relations with Great Britain were Egypfs chief needs. The Government of Mahmoud Pasha appeared to be making an honest attempt to satisfy them, and in doing so they could count on the support oi His Majesty&apos;s Government. This was enough, and the King, realising that the Residency were on the alert, forbore from provoking a crisis in wdiich he would have had His Majesty&apos;s Government against him. Lord Lloyd returned to Egypt in November, and at the end of the month he obtained an assurance from the King that he would do nothing to add to Mahmoud Pasha&apos;s difficulties. The latter had become seriously ill with paratyphoid, which incapacitated him for several months.21. On the Prime Ministers recovery, negotiations were concluded between the Egyptian Government and Mr. Leith-Ross, representing the Treasury, on the vexed questions of the payment of interest on the Ottoman Loan of 1855; Egypt s claim to a share in reparations; and various financial claims and counter-claims which had been outstanding since the war period. A comprehensive settlement was arrived at which met the interests of both parties, and a long outstanding source ot friction was thus eliminated.22. In the autumn of 1928 the question of the control and distribution of the waters of the Nile as between Egypt and the Sudan (see paragraph 4 above) took a new turn. As long ago as 1925 the issue had been referred to a commission consisting of two experts, representing Egypt and the Sudan respectively, under a neutral chairman, a Dutchman. Unfortunately, the chairman died before the report was completed. Notwithstanding this, the two experts continued their discussions ana in due course reached agreement. No Egyptian Government, however, had tne political courage to adopt and give effect to their report, which remained, as it were, in suspense. Spasmodic discussions had taken place at various times with i Egyptian Government on certain aspects of the question, and the aborti Chamberlain-Sarwat Treaty provided for a settlement of the issue.  It was not un
the 7th May last, however, that notes were exchanged, as a result of which this problem, which had long been a potential source of serious friction, has been solved for a good many years to come at least. Negotiations were protracted and difficult, since the waters of the Nile are of essential interest to Egypt and hardly less so to the Sudan; the interests of certain East African dependencies, moreover, had to be taken into consideration. At the eleventh hour a hitch occurred, which, in Lord Lloyd&apos;s view, destroyed the prospects of agreement. But, fortunately, the difficulty was resolved by the action of the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who happened to be in this country, and who, at the instance of the Foreign Office, brought all his influence to bear upon the Government in Cairo. In the event, a fair and reasonable agreement was concluded which, save for some perfunctory and mechanical protests organised by the Wafd, has been received with satisfaction in almost all quarters in Egypt.23. For some years past the question of the Capitulations has been engaging Egyptian attention to an increasing extent. There is a feeling of resentment at the fact that Turkey, Persia, China, &amp;c, should have, in varying degrees, and by different means, succeeded in throwing off the restraints of an extra-territorial regime, while Egypt, with as high, or a higher, level of culture and civilisation, has made no material progress in this direction. In April 1927 Sarwat Pasha visited this country (see paragraph 14 above), and raised the issue of capitulatory reform. Conversations subsequently took place with the authorisation of Sir Austen Chamberlain between him and Sir John Percival, the judicial adviser to the Egyptian Government, which resulted in an understanding, generally known as the Sarwat-Percival Agreement. This agreement was limited in scope and confined to certain concrete changes. A much wider measure of reform was contemplated in the unsigned Chamberlain-Sarwat Treaty, clause 9 of which read : &quot;His Britannic Majesty undertakes to use all his influence with the Powers possessing capitulatory rights in Egypt to obtain the modification of the capitulatory regime now existing in Egypt so as to make it conform more closely with the spirit of the times and with the present state of Egypt.&quot;A draft note defining more precisely the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment was also agreed with. Sarwat Pasha. The draft treaty was, of course, rejected by the Egyptian Government, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have thus no commit-ment. except as regards the Sarwat-Percival Agreement, mentioned above, which was concluded independently of the treaty negotiations. In December 1927 the Egyptian Government issued an invitation to all the Powers concerned to attend a conference to discuss certain limited changes in the existing system. His Majesty&apos;s Government, in due course, accepted this invitation, but the conference has, in fact, never met. largely owing to the attitude of the Latin Powers, who have sought by individual negotiations to impose various conditions [e.g., additional posts for their own nationals, &amp;c.) as the price of their acceptance. The present Egyptian Govern-ment is dissatisfied with this state of affairs, and is likely to propose a radical change, namely, the suppression of all foreign consular courts in Egypt and the transfer of their powers to the Mixed Courts, His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the draft note agreed with Sarwat Pasha and referred to above, had assented conditionally to this transfer, but in present circumstances it appears injudicious on the part of the Egyptian Government to force the pace by pressing at this stage for so far-reaching a reform, seeing that nearly two years have passed without their having succeeded in obtaining the assent of the Powers to much more limited changes. The Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he visited this country recently, was given to understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to express no view on the principle involved, but that they were definitely of the opinion that Egypt would be well advised to proceed with caution, and step by step.24. Two further important issues, depending in the main upon the capitulatory system, have recently arisen. In the first place, the last remaining commercial con-vention between Egypt and a foreign Power (under which other Powers also benefit by reason of most-favoured-nation clauses) comes to an end in 1930. The Egyptian Government have announced their intention of imposing a new and much, higher tariff (at present the general rate is 8 per cent, ad valorem), less as a protective measure than as a means of raising new revenue. Theoretically the position in strict law appears to be that His Majesty&apos;s Government, under the provisions of the capitulatory treaties, might argue that on the expiry of her existing tariff engagements, Egypt should revert to a flat tariff rate of 3 per cent, ad valorem.  In practice it is plainly
out of the question to insist on so unreasonable a demand. All we need ensure is that British trade with Egypt should receive fair treatment both absolutely and relatively to foreign trade. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that we do possess treaty rights, which we may urgently need to employ in self-defence on some future occasion. A compromise is therefore being aimed at under which our treaty rights will be reserved, but no obstacle will be placed in the way of the desire of the Egyptian Government to increase their tariff, provided that this is done on an equitable basis. The prospects of such a compromise being arrived at seem not unfavourable. The Egyptian Government have declared themselves ready to give the commercial interests concerned time to study and comment on the new draft tariff before it is brought into force.25. The second question of importance which has recently arisen is that involved in the imposition of new taxation by the Egyptian Government. Egypt&apos;s financial position is at present very sound, in fact enviable, but the large programme of irrigation-tion and other works, educational reform, and improvements in various directions to which the present Government is committed, will entail heavy expenditure and will require, according to the Egyptian Government, a considerably larger annual revenue than the present figure of some 35 millions. Under the Capitulations, new taxation cannot be imposed on foreigners in Egypt without the consent of the foreign Govern-ments concerned. This consent is often difficult, if not impossible to obtain, and since it is manifestly inequitable to impose upon Egyptians taxation which is not borne by foreigners, it results in practice that practically no new taxes are imposed at all. As has been mentioned above, the Egyptian Government regard the raising of additional revenue as essential, and they further maintain that the present incidence of taxation is inequitable, since the great bulk of it falls upon the land alone, leaving commerce and other sources of revenue almost untapped. The Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the occasion of his recent visit here, asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government should assent in principle to certain new taxes being made legally applicable to British subjects in Egypt. Lord Lloyd, who was consulted, expressed himself as opposed in the main to concessions in this direction. In all the circum-stances, however, Sir Austen Chamberlain decided that it was necessary to over-rule the High Commissioner^ objections, and the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government sympathised in principle with the Egyptian Governments request. It was pointed out, however, that no definite commitment could be entered into until concrete proposals had been put forward by the Egyptian Government and, further, that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared at this stage to bring pressure upon foreign Powers if these latter should prove recalcitrant.26. The correspondence exchanged with Lord Lloyd on the subject discussed in the preceding paragraph furnished a further instance of that divergence of view as between the High Commissioner and.the Foreign Office, which has frequently manifested itself, in respect of British policy in Egypt. In the circumstances. Sir Austen Chamberlain decided to address to Lord Lloyd a despatch redefining the general lines on which our relations with Egypt should be conducted. This despatch (a copy of which is attached (see Appendix III)) reached Cairo on about the date of the late Governments resignation. The narrative in the present memorandum has thus been brought up to date.27. As to the future of Anglo-Egyptian relations, the outlook may perhaps .be regarded as more promising than it has been at any time during the last ten years. To simplify what is, of course, in reality complex, the principal factors in the situation may be set down as the High Commissioner, King Fuad, the Wafd. and the present Egyptian Government. The account of events of the past five years which has been attempted in this paper, will serve to show the important, indeed often decisive, role which His Majesty&apos;s representative is necessarily called upon to play in Egyptian affairs.28. King Fuad owes his position to us, to the extent that he was proclaimed Sultan during the war, and under the regime of our Protectorate. From our point of view, his subsequent actions may best be described as a recurrent nuisance. Energetic, and by no means unintelligent, he is an inveterate and devious intriguer, who is detested by many of his subjects and liked by few. His manoeuvres all have a common purpose, namely, to increase his personal&quot;power. His ambition is to rule Egypt as an autocrat, and to this end he works against whatever personage or party is for the moment in the ascendant. He is generally in opposition to the Residency. At one time he intrigued with the Wafd against the Liberal-Constitutional party;;
at another, he worked with &quot;anyone whom he could find, against Saad Zaghlul. At the moment lie is jealous of and hostile to Mohammed Pasha Mahmoud, whose success he grudges and whose fall he hopes to bring about, as and when he can do so without undue risk to himself. Throughout all his intrigues, however, he is to some extent restrained by the realisation that his unpopularity is such, that were His Majesty&apos;s Government formally and publicly to disown him, his position would at once become precarious, and probably in the end untenable.29. The Wafd, as a purely political party, has of late fallen on evil days. It owed its rise to a dominant position to the personality of Saad Pasha Zaghlul, who, in some respects at least, was worthy of the exceptional devotion in which he was held by the great majority of his countrymen. On his death, the party machine fell into the hands of a group of extremists of varying degrees of fanaticism, but who, with a few exceptions, lack ability, balance and experience. Nahas Pasha, the head of the party, is regarded as an honest man, but is stupid and incapable, and is generally realised to be so even by his own followers. The weakness of the Wafd&apos;s leadership and their lack of talent generally, together with the success of the present Government and the phase of great material prosperity through, which. Egypt is now passing, has induced a condition of political apathy. The Wafd find it equally difficult to raise funds or to foment disturbance. One of their chief assets is the discontent of the Senators and Deputies, who for the most part are persons of some importance in their own districts and who have for the time being lost their main employment as the result of the suspension of Parliament. But while the feeling of apathy mentioned above largely paralyses the activities of the Wafd as a political party, there is another and more important aspect of the question. The Wafd represents a sentiment or tradition. Over 90 per cent, of the population of Egypt is illiterate and not given to close reasoning or analysis. The bulk of the electorate have no particular regard for the individuals who represent them in Parliament in the Wafdist interest, and no great predilection for the Wafd&apos;s programme. (It should here be remarked that the programmes of all the four political parties in Egypt are virtually identical.) But a good deal of the Zaghlul tradition remains. What was his party represents in most Egyptian minds the sentiments of nationality and patriotism. To vote against the Wafd would, as it were, be an unworthy action. Although, the electorate may at present take little interest in what the party leaders may say or do, there is little doubt that if elections were to be held in Egypt to-morrow the Wafd would again be returned with a considerable majority. This may well remain true for years to come.30. The last, and at the moment the most important, factor in the Egyptian situation, is the present Government. It represents, in the main, the Constitutional-Liberal party, which, is the only considerable political organisation in Egypt outside the Wafd. It includes many of the best brains in the country and a considerable proportion of its wealthier and more influential inhabitants. Its programme is ostensibly identical with that of the Wafd, but it has never had a leader of a popularity comparable to that of Zaghlul, or, indeed, any figure who has attempted any wide measure of popular appeal. As the result, the party has no great following in the country and has aptly been described as a General Staff without an army. But it must be noted that it is by no means reactionary. Mohammed Pasha Mahmoud, for example, was one of those deported with Zaghlul under martial law as an agitator. It was he who was instrumental in persuading Zaghlul to negotiate writh Lord Milner and he only parted from Zaghlul when the latter went back on the agreement he had accepted. It was Mahmoud, further, who was the mainspring of the movement which led to the drawing up and adoption of the present Egyptian constitution. He claims to be, doubtless sincerely, a convinced constitutionalist who has suspended the constitution for a time only in order to clear the ground, and enable a fresh start to be made. It is certainly a fact that any real progress had become virtually impossible under the late regime. The large Wafd parliamentary majority, partly from inexperience, and partly from personal and unworthy motives, had formed the habit of interfering with the executive in innumerable matters of detail on behalf of their own sectional interests. In these conditions, to carry through, the large schemes of internal reform which have become very necessary was in practice impossible. In the case of external affairs, matters were no better. Extremists felt impelled to attack foreign interests, more particularly, of course, our own, while few of the more responsible politicians cared to risk their party reputation by advocating moderation openly. A notable instance of this tendency was the rejection of the Chamberlain-Sarwat Treaty.    This[19487] c
Appendix I.Communication to be Addressed to the Sultan by the High Commissioner. Your Highness,I HAVE the honour to bring to your Highness&apos;s notice that certain passages of the explanatory note which I addressed to you on the 3rd December, 1921, were interpreted, to my great disappointment, in a manner not in accordance with the intention and policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. Judging by many comments which have been published on the subject of this note, it would appear that many Egyptians were under the impression that Great Britain was about to abandon her liberal and favourable attitude towards Egyptian aspirations and to make use of her special position in Egypt in order to maintain a political and administrative regime incompatible with the freedom she had offered.3. Such an interpretation of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government was quite mistaken. On the contrary, the explanatory note emphasised the dominating principle that the guarantees claimed by Great Britain are not designed to involve the continuance of an actual or virtual protectorate. Great Britain, as it is stated therein, sincerely desires to see &quot;an Egypt enjoying the national prerogatives and the international position of a sovereign State.&quot;4. If Egyptians have regarded these guarantees as being out of keeping with the position of a free country, they have, on the other hand, lost sight of the fact that Great Britain has been obliged to claim them out of consideration for her own security in face of a situation which demands great prudence on her part, particularly an the matter of the disposition of her troops.   Present world conditions, however,winstrument contained many provisions which were undeniably very much to K&quot;ypt&apos;s advantage.   Nevertheless the treaty was rejected for practical purposes unread and without any attempt on the part of the Egyptian Government to bargain, or to eliminate what were objectionable features from their point of view.  Parliamentary Government, in short, under the inept control of Nahas Pasha, seemed to have led Egypt into an impasse, both at home and abroad.    In these circumstances   1 Mohammed Pasha Mahmoud has attempted the experiment of suspending Parliament for a given period, during which he proposes to initiate the internal reforms already,, 1 long overdue, and at the same time, by reaching a general settlement with I His Majesty&apos;s Government, to dispose of another serious complication which confronted the Egyptian Chamber.   When his programme is well under way, the 1 Prime Minister contemplates the restoration of a constitutional regime.   A start &apos; has been made with the Governments programme, in various directions.    The conclusion of the Nile Agreement (see paragraph 22 above) has cleared the way for the undertaking of the large irrigation works which are becoming urgently necessary I to provide for Egypt&apos;s increasingly congested population.   The Government have announced a programme of such works which will cost some  25 million spread 8 over ten years.   Large electrification projects to supply light and power to the whole country; the supply of clean drinking water throughout the provinces to check the I parasitic diseases which at present do an incalculable amount of harm; plans for 9 the allotment of State lands to- small holders; legislation for the protection of labour, &amp;c, are all under examination.   In the matter of Egypt&apos;s external relations the financial agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government has already been noted. Discussions with other Powers respecting the capitulatory system are being carried I on; and finally, and most important from our point of view, the Prime Minister has publicly declared that he is anxious to arrive at a final settlement of the political issues outstanding between Egypt and His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Mohammed j Pasha Mahmoud&apos;s programme, in short, is acceptable from our.point of view, and calculated to provide for Egypt&apos;s urgent needs.   If it were not carried through as a I result of the opposition of the Wafd, or the intrigues of King Fuad, or a combination j of both, it seems probable that Egypt would have cause for regret since it is hardly I likely that conditions so favourable to the beginnings of some real progress and m development would recur for years to come.   The domination of the King on the I one hand, or the Wafd on the other, would equally prevent this..   Foreign Office, June 13, 1929.
and the state of effervescence which has prevailed in Egypt since the armistice are not permanent factors, and it is to be hoped that while, on the one hand, the former will eventually improve, on the other hand, the time will come when, in the language of that note, Egypfs record will give confidence in her own guarantees.5. As to any desire to interfere in the internal administration of Egypt, His Majesty&apos;s Government have sufficiently stated, and repeat, that their most ardent desire is to place in Egyptian hands the conduct of their own affairs. The draft agreement proposed by Great Britain did not depart from this idea, and in making provision for the presence of two British officials in the Ministries of Finance and Justice, it was not her intention to use these two officials for the purpose of inter-vening in Egyptian affairs, but solely in order to preserve the contact requisite for protecting foreign interests.6. Such is the sole bearing of the guarantees that were demanded by Great Britain. They were claimed without any desire to impede Egyptians enjoying the full rights of a national Government.7. Animated as she is by these intentions, it will be understood that it is repugnant to Great BritTain, on the one hand, to see Egyptians delay by their own acts the realisation of an ideal aimed at by both parties, and, on the other, to be compelled herself to intervene to re-establish order when it is threatened in such a way as to arouse the fears of foreigners and to involve the interests of foreign Powers. It would be much to be regretted if Egyptians should see in the exceptional measures which have recently been taken any prejudice to the ideal to which they aspire or an intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to alter the policy I have indicated. In taking these measures, the sole desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been to put an end to a harmful agitation which, by arousing popular passions, might have such consequences as to jeopardise the whole result of the efforts of the Egyptian nation. These measures were taken primarily in the interest of the Egyptian cause, which has everything to gain by being studied in an atmosphere of calm and friendly discussion.8. Now that tranquillity seems to be re-establishing itself, thanks to the wise spirit which, is the root of the Egyptian character and asserts itself in times of crisis, I am happy to be able to announce to your Highness that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to recommend the accompanying declaration for the approval of Parliament. This will, I am confident, establish a regime of mutual confidence and lay the foundation for a satisfactory and final solution of the Egyptian problem.9. There is no obstacle to the re-establishment forthwith of an Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs which will prepare the way for the creation of the diplomatic and consular representation of Egypt.10. The creation of a Parliament with a right to control the policy and administration of a constitutionally responsible Government is a matter for your Highness and the Egyptian people to determine. Should circumstances arise to delay the coming into force of the Act of Indemnity with application to all inhabitants of Egypt mentioned in the declaration accompanying this note, I desire to inform your Highness that I shall be prepared, pending the repeal of the proclamation-mation of the 2nd November, 1914, to suspend the application of martial law in respect of all matters affecting the free exercise of the political rights of Egyptians.11. It is now for Egypt to respond, and it is to be hoped she will justly appreciate the good intentions of Great Britain, and that reflection and not passion will guide her attitude. .Declaration to Egypt (Febrtiary 28, 1922).Whereas His Majesty&apos;s Government, in accordance with, their declared intentions, desire forthwith to recognise Egypt as an independent sovereign State; andWhereas the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Egypt are of vital interest to the British. Empire;The following principles are hereby declared: 1. The British Protectorate over Egypt is terminated, and Egypt is declared to be an independent sovereign State.2. So soon as the Government of his Highness shall pass an Act of Indemnity with application to all inhabitants of Egypt, martial law as proclaimed on the 2nd November, 1914, shall be withdrawn.[19487] c 2
3. The following matters are absolutely reserved to the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government until such time as it may be possible by free discussion and friendly accommodation on both sides to conclude agreements in regard thereto between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Egypt: (a.) The security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt. (b.) The defence of Egypt against all foreign aggression or interference, direct or indirect.(c.) The protection of foreign interests in Egypt and the protection of minorities (d.) The Sudan.Pending the conclusion of such agreements, the status quo in all these matters shall remain intact.Appendix II.Mr. MacDonald to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner for Egypt and the Sudan.My Lord, Foreign Office, October 7, 1924.IN the course of my conversations with the Egyptian Prime Minister his Excellency explained to me the modifications in the status quo in Egypt on which lie felt bound to insist.  If I have correctly understood him they were as follows : (a.) The withdrawal of all British forces from Egyptian territory.(b.) The withdrawal of the financial and judicial advisers.(c.) The disappearance of all British control over the Egyptian Government, notably in connexion with foreign relations, which Zaghlul Pasha claimed were hampered by the notification of His Majesty&apos;s Government to foreign Powers on the 15th March, 1922, that they would regard as an unfriendly act any attempt at interference in the affairs of Egypt by another Power.(d.) The abandonment by His Majesty&apos;s Government of their claim to protect foreigners and minorities in Egypt.(e.) The abandonment by Elis Majesty&apos;s Government of their claim to share in any way in protecting the Suez Canal.As regards the Sudan, I drew attention to certain statements which his Excel-lency had made as President of the Council of Ministers before the Egyptian Parliament during the course of the summer. On the 17th May, according to my information, Zagnlul Pasha stated that the fact that a foreign officer was Commander-in-chief of the Egyptian army and the retention in that army of British officers were inconsistent with the dignity of independent Egypt. The expression of such sentiments in an official pronouncement by the responsible head of the Egyptian Government has obviously placed not only Sir Lee Stack as Sirdar, but all British officers attached to the Egyptian army, in a difficult position. I also had in mind that, in June, Zaghlul Pasha was reported to have claimed for Egypt complete rights of ownership over the Sudan and characterised the British Government as usurpers.His Excellency observed that in making the above statements he was merely voicing the opinion not only of the Egyptian Parliament, but of the Egyptian nation, and I gathered that he still adhered to that position. Such statements, however, must inevitably have affected the minds of Egyptians employed in the Sudan, and of the Sudanese personnel of the Egyptian army. They have indeed made it appear that loyalty to the Egyptian Government is something different from and inconsistent with loyalty to the existing administration of the Sudan. As a result, not only has there been an entire change in the spirit of Anglo-Egyptian co-operation which has in the past prevailed in the Sudan, but also Egyptian subjects serving under the Sudan Government have been encouraged to regard themselves as propagandists of the Egyptian Governments views, with results that, if persisted in, in the absence of any agreement, would render their presence in the Sudan under the existing regime a source of danger to public order.I promised in the course of our first conversation to be perfectly frank with his Excellency. Then and subsequently I left him under no illusion as to the position which His Majesty&apos;s Government are compelled to take up in regard to Egypt and the Sudan.   Your Lordship will recall that when His Majesty&apos;s Government
withdrew the British protectorate over Egypt in 1922 they reserved certain matters for eventual settlement by agreement. Though I have by no means abandoned hope that on further consideration the basis of an agreement acceptable to both countries can be found, the attitude adopted by Zaghlul Pasha has rendered such agreement impossible for the present. I raised the question of the Canal straight away because its security is of vital interest to us both in peace and in war. It is no less true to-day than in 1922 that the security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt remain a vital British interest, and that absolute certainty that the Suez Canal will remain open in peace as well as in war for the free passage of British ships is the foundation on which the entire defensive strategy of the British Empire rests. The 1888 convention for the free navigation of the Canal was an instrument devised to secure that object. Its ineffectiveness for this purpose was demonstrated in 1914, when Great Britain herself had to take steps to ensure that the Canal would remain open. No British Government, in the light of that experience, can divest itself wholly, even in favour of an ally, of its interest in guarding such a vital link in British communications. Such a security must be a feature of any agreement come to between our two Governments, and I see no reason why accommodation is impossible, given goodwill.The effective co-operation of Great Britain and Egypt in protecting those communications might, in my view, have been ensured by the conclusion of a treaty of close alliance. The presence of a British force in Egypt provided for by such a treaty freely entered into by both parties on an equal footing would in no way be incompatible with Egyptian independence, whilst it would be an indication of the specially close and intimate relations between the two countries and their determina-tion to co-operate in a matter of vital concern to both. It is not the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government that this force should in any way interfere with the functions of the Egyptian Government or encroach upon Egyptian sovereignty, and I emphatically said so. It is not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to assume any responsibility for the actions or conduct of the Egyptian Government or to attempt to control or direct the policy which that Government may see fit to adopt.So far as my conversations with Zaghlul Pasha turned on the question of the Sudan, they have only served to show his persistence in the attitude disclosed in his previous public utterances. I must adhere to the statements I made on the subject in the House of Commons. About that neither in Egypt nor in the Sudan should there be any doubt.  If there is, it will only lead to trouble.In the meantime the duty of preserving order in the Sudan rests in fact upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, and they will take every step necessary for this purpose. Since going there, they have contracted heavy moral obligations by the creation of a good system of administration; they cannot allow that to be destroyed; they regard their responsibilities as a trust for the Sudan people; there can be no question of their abandoning the Sudan until their work is done.His Majesty&apos;s Government have no desire to disturb existing arrangements, but they must point out how intolerable is a status quo which enables both military and civil officers and officials to conspire against civil order, and, unless the status quo is accepted and loyally worked until such time as a new arrangement may be reached, the Sudan Government would fail in its duty were it to allow such conditions to continue.His Majesty&apos;s Government have never failed to recognise that Egypt has certain material interests in the Sudan which must be guaranteed and safeguarded these being chiefly concerned with her share of the Nile water and the satisfaction of any financial claims which she may have against the Sudan Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government have always been prepared to secure these interests in a way satisfactory to Egypt.I have in the preceding paragraphs defined the position which His Majesty&apos;s Government are compelled to take up in regard to Egypt and the Sudan, and which T conceive it to be my duty to conserve unimpaired.I am, &amp;c.J. RAMSAY MacDONALD.
Appendix III. Sir Austen Chamberlain to Lord Lloyd [Cairo).(No. 495.)My Lord, Foreign Office, May 28, 1929.THE correspondence which recently passed between your Lordship and myself in regard to the suggested extension of certain Egyptian taxes to British subjects in Egypt has led me to think that it may be convenient to your Lordship and is in itself desirable that I should restate briefly the principles upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to regulate their policy in Egypt.2. Imperial considerations and the necessity of safeguarding the comrmmica-tions between the different parts of the Empire have caused His Majestys Government in the past not only to assume a position of authority in Egypt outweighing that of any other foreign Government, but also to stand between Egypt and the rest of the world, protecting her from any external pressure. It is the vital character of the imperial interests thus safeguarded which requires the presence on Egyptian soil of British armed forces and the retention of that special influence which His Majesty&apos;s Government exercise through His Majesty ;s High Commissioner.3. From the situation thus created certain consequences flow7, secondary in their nature but of the utmost importance. &quot;Where the influence of His Majestys Government prevails, and where their powerful protection is afforded, patent misgovernment cannot be tolerated, and since His Majesty&apos;s Government have formally announced that they will not tolerate foreign intervention, they are bound to see that a reasonable regime is secured for foreign inhabitants.4. Because the interests at stake are of supreme importance to the safety and well-being of the British Empire, His Majesty&apos;s Government reserved by their declaration of the 28th February, 1922, certain matters for their own deter mina-tion, but even in these cases it is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to act with and, where possible, through the Egyptian Government, respecting in the largest measure possible the liberties and independence which by the same declaration they conceded to Egypt.5. It is not in the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government to intervene in the internal affairs of Egypt further than is necessary to secure the political objects defined above. The influence which they must ever possess in the councils of Egypt, whether actual or potential, will be best secured by ensuring that the closest harmony shaU always govern the relations between the Residency and the Egyptian Government, and these conditions can only obtain if the interventions of His Majesty&apos;s Government into the purely internal affairs of Egypt are reduced to the minimum.6. The very fact that in certain limited but most important cases the interven-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government must be made effective, no matter what the cost, renders it the more necessary that their intervention should be strictly confined to matters of real importance. Since in certain cases it is essential that the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government should prevail, their influence must not be frittered away on other and less important matters. Above all, in order that their intervention when it takes place may be decisive, it must never be invoked to cover an abuse or to resist reasonable reforms. Save during the period of the war, Egypt has always enjoyed a very large measure of autonomy, though the degree of autonomy may have varied from time to time according to the political situation of the moment. Applying the principles here laid down, I hold at the present time that, in con-sidering whether in any particular case recourse is to be had to intervention in the internal affairs of Egypt, the criterion to be applied should be not whether the object aimed at is merely desirable, but whether it is necessary in order to safeguard the interests of the Empire as defined in the earlier paragraphs of this despatch.7. The difference between the situation occupied by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Egypt and that which they occupy in the Sudan lends point to the observations set forth above. In the Sudan, though the Condominium continues to be recognised, the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the population is direct, and to meet it it is necessary for them to feel sure that in any particular case their orders shall be obeyed. In Egypt the responsibility is indirect and contingent, and only ui a very limited category of affairs can it be necessary that the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government shall be exercised, though it is to be hoped that when the Egyptians realise the strict limits which His Majesty&apos;s Government place upon their
oown activities, they will be the more inclined to seek on other points of difficulty or delicacy the friendly counsel which His Majesty&apos;s Government will always be willing to afford them.8. This exposition of policy will, I hope, have made clear to your Lordship the reasons which inspired my reply to the representations made to me by Dr. Hafiz Afifi during his&quot;recent visit to London. I am not convinced that the maintenance of foreign privilege in Egypt, per se, is a cause for the defence of which His Majesty&apos;s Government is required to exercise pressure on the Egyptian Government. The Capitulations have disappeared, or are in a fair way to disappear, in every country in which they have hitherto obtained, and sound policy would appear to require the gradual acceptance of a similar evolution in Egypt unless it can be shown in any particular case that there are cogent reasons for maintaining them. None such were evident to me in the question of the applicability of the Egyptian taxes under discussion to British subjects, nor could I bring myself to believe that British influence could be strengthened or the interests of British subjects permanently served by insistence on the maintenance of an invidious and indefensible exemption from a fair contribution to services of which they share the benefits.I am, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.
