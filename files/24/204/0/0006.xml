rThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.;Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1921).CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 158 (29)CABINET.RUSSIA.Circulated by direction of the Secretary of staff. for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues the attached memorandum on the question of the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet.A. H.June 19, 1929.[N 2795/18/38]IN considering the steps to be taken towards a resumption of relations with the Soviet Government, it may he useful to summarise the different forms which these relations have taken in the&quot; past few years.The Trade Agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the Eussian Socialist Soviet Republic was signed on the 16th March, 1921. Under that agreement Russia was enabled, inter alia, to appoint official agents in the United Kingdom, who enjoyed the same privileges as are accorded to the official representatives of other foreign Governments. The agreement did not, however, accord de jure recognition to the Soviet Government.The next step was taken on the 1st February, 1924, when a note was com-municated to the soviet Government through Mr. Hodgson, His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Moscow. The first paragraph of this note ran as follows: &quot;T have the honour, by direction of my Government, to inform your Excellency that they recognise the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics as the de jure rulers of those territories of the old Russian Empire which-acknowledge their authority.&quot; The note also proposed the conclusion of treaties covering various outstanding questions, and these proposals led to the signature of the-General and Commercial Treaties of the 8th August, 1924,-which, however, were not ratified. : Finally, His Majesty&apos;s Government expressed their readiness to receive a Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires in London and announced that Mr. Hodgson was appointed Charge d&apos;Affaires &quot;in Moscow pending the appointment of an Ambassador.- The position was thus, that from the 1st February, 1924, onwards, the Soviet Government had received de jure recognition from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and1 diplomatic relations existed between the two Governments, but the Trade Agreement remained as the instrument governing their relations in those matters covered by it. This condition remained unaltered until the 26th May, 1927. On that date a note was addressed to M. Rosengolz,&apos; the Soviet Charge d&apos;affairs&apos;es in London, which stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain &quot; must now regard themselves; in accordance with the provision bf paragraph 3 of article 13 of the Trade&apos; Agreement of the 16th March, 1921, as free from the obligations of that agreement.&quot; The note further stated that while the special privileges conferred on the Russian trade agents under the agreement were terminated, His Majesty&apos;s Government did hot wish to interfere with the ordinary course of legitimate Anglo-Russian trade, and would place no obstacle in the way of general commerce between the two countries; there was consequently no objection to the continuance of the legitimate commercial operation of- Areos (^Limited), on the same conditions as those applicable to other trading-organisations in this country. 1 -4933   [19470]Copy No.If
The note finally conveyed to M. Rosengolz the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government that they could no longer maintain diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government; that the existing relations between the two Govei&apos;nments were suspended; and that M. Rosengolz and his staff must leave the country within ten days.The effect of this was to suspend the diplomatic intercourse between the two countries and to terminate the Trade Agreement, but this action did not affect the de jure recognition accorded in 1924. The present position therefore is that His Majesty ^Government recognise the Soviet Government as a de jure Government, but have no diplomatic relations or treaty engagements (leaving aside for the moment the question of the validity or otherwise of old treaties) with them.If it is now decided to resume diplomatic relations, no action is necessary as regards a formal recognition of the Soviet Government, and the question for consideration is the conditions which should be attached by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to the exchange of diplomatic representatives.One possibility would be the resurrection of the Trade Agreement cancelled in 1927. This course appears simple at first sight, but is open to various objections. The form of the agreement is obsolete, as it is between &quot;His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government&quot; and the Government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic. In the body of the agreement the contracting party on the British side is described as &quot;the Government of the United Kingdom&quot; and the &quot;British Government.&quot; Although it is clear from the text that the agreement refers, on the British side, to the United Kingdom alone, it yet contains various provisions which are now out of date and would thus probably require redrafting. Moreover, the system under which Russian trade agents were granted what were practically tantamount to diplomatic privileges cannot be defended if &quot;a Russian Legation or diplomatic representative is to coexist with the trade representation. While, therefore, there would no doubt be some advantage in simply returning to the statics quo as it existed before May 1927 (and some parts of the agreement would certainly be valuable), any attempt to do so by reviving, the Trade Agreement would be likely to lead to prolonged negotia-tions&apos; for the revision of the terms of that instrument, negotiations which might preferably be deferred until the time comes to negotiate a proper commercial treaty. If this view is accepted, an alternative course will be to inform the Soviet Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to resume diplomatic relations on certain stated conditions.The main points of principle at issue between the two Governments have been (a) the claims of British subjects and companies for compensation in respect of properties and concessions which have been nationalised (estimated by the claimants at some  180 million); (b) the claims of British holders of pre-war State and municipal securities for compensation in respect of the repudiation of those securities (approximately  40 million); (c) miscellaneous claims in respect of various forms of property, money confiscated, &amp;c. (about  35 million); this category of claims includes various particularly hard cases; (d) propaganda. There is also the question of the Russian war debt to this country (approximately  800 million) and Russian counter-claims (intervention; Brest-Litovsk; gold, &amp;c).The Soviet Government have shown no indication of changing their policy of completely refusing either to recognise any liability for debts incurred by their predecessors, or to give any compensation in respect of confiscated properties. If. therefore, it is decided that an early resumption of relations would be advantageous, the conditions laid down should not include any reference to claims or confiscated properties, on which agreement cannot be looked for. A discussion of the various classes of claims would also again lead the Russians to make any partial settlement to which they might agree dependent on the grant of a loan.It is, however, important to secure an undertaking from the Soviet Government to the effect that they will abstain from propaganda. From our previous experience we cannot expect that any such promise will be observed, but our position is strengthened if such an undertaking exists and can be pointed to in case of necessity. Undertakings on this subject were given by the Soviet Government in the Trade Agreement of 1921 and in the correspondence which passed in 1923. The undertaking reappeared in article 16 of the treaty signed in 1924. The wording of this article was as follows :  ,   ,.&quot; The contracting parties solemnly affirm their desire and intention to live in peace and amity with each other, scrupulously to respect the undoubted rightof a State to order its own life within, its own jurisdiction in its own way, to refrain and to restrain all persons and organisations under their direct or
indirect control, including organisations in receipt of any financial assistance from them, from any act overt or covert liable in any way whatsoever to endanger the tranquillity or prosperity of any: part of the territory of the British Empire or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or intended to embitter the relations of the British Empire or the Union with their neighbours or any other countries.&quot; ...4,s qur object at the outset would be to indicate to the Soviet Government our requirements, &quot;it would on a point of tactics be best to adapt this article as an undertaking by the Soviet Government alone. They would no doubt ask for it to be made bilateral, and there would be no conceivable objection to our giving a similar undertaking.Another condition which should be insisted upon is an acknowledgement by the Soviet Government that they have no cause of complaint as to the conduct of the British Mission in Moscow up to the time of its withdrawal. The reason for such an acknowledgement is that in 1927 a number of people were shot in Russia as a result of a totally unfounded accusation that they had been employed by Sir R. Hodgson and his staff in espionage, while attacks on the conduct of the mission and allegations of espionage were made in speeches delivered by various Soviet leaders. It is also for consideration whether this condition should not include a demand for the release and payment of compensation to some of the minor Russian employees of the mission. In this category the following may be mentioned : Surkov (second chauffeur to Sir R. Hodgson) and Vera Reiblatt (an elderly woman, doorkeeper) were arrested in August 1927 on charges of espionage and exiled respectively to Solovki and Siberia. The Norwegian Minister in Moscow, who is in charge of British interests, has made frequent endeavours to secure their release, but without success. Miss Rossinkaya, the Russian typist employed by the consul at Petrograd, was imprisoned in 1927 because she applied for a visa to go to Finland at the time when the British Mission was leaving the country. Endeavours are being made to ascertain the present position in her case.In spite of the objection to interfering between the Soviet Government and its own citizens, there appears to be every reason to require, as a condition of sending a British representative to Moscow, that reparation should be made to these unfortunate people, whose only offence is that they accepted employment with the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government. If any stipulation to cover such cases is made, it will have to be insisted upon as a. sine qua non, as to yield the point later would only make the position worse than before.Procedure.As regards the procedure to be adopted, if the resumption of relations is decided upon, the first step would be to communicate the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to the Dominion Governments, and to ask those Governments for their views. When de jure recognition was granted on the 1st February, 1924, the Dominions were only informed on the 30th January of the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the procedure then adopted raised a certain amount of criticism in some of the Dominions. There was also at first some doubt as to the exact scope of the action taken, i.e., whether the Soviet Government had, or had not, received de jure recognition from the whole Empire.The question of the resumption of diplomatic relations appears to be one on which the Dominion Governments should be consulted and not merely informed, and in fact the British High Commissioner at Ottawa was authorised, in a letter dated the 22nd May, 1929, to inform the Canadian Prime Minister that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would in no case renew diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia without previous communication with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ments in the Dominions. A representative sent by the King to Moscoav would have a representative character in respect of the whole Empire, unless any Dominion wished to send a separate representative of its own. It is His Majesty who enters into diplomatic relations with any foreign Power, and he cannot well be in diplomatic relations with a country in, respect of one part of his Empire and not of the whole. Agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Dominion Governments is therefore an essential condition precedent to any action.As soon as the views of the Dominion Governments have been ascertained and it has been decided whether diplomatic relations are to be resumed, ^and, if so, on wliat, terms, various courses of action would be possible.  For instance, the Secretary
of State might announce in Parliament that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be averse&apos;from the exchange of diplomatic representatives provided that satisfactory guarantees were obtained against the renewal of the activities of which successive British Governments have had to complain. The Russians might then be left to make the next move and to enquire what guarantees were required. Alternatively; if it is desired that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make the first move, and if it is decided that they need only insist, at this stage, on satisfaction on the points specified above, the Soviet Government might be informed through the Norwegian Minister that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be; prepared to resume normal diplomatic-relations, provided the Soviet Governmenfsatisfied &apos;theitt that the guarantees against propaganda and intrigue, on which successive British Governments have insisted1 for years, were to be observed, and that any British representatives sent to Russia&apos;would be&apos;properly treated. It would then be for the Russians to offer-guarantees and for His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider whether they were satisfactory.A third alternative, and the simplest, would be to inform the Soviet Govern-ment, through the Norwegian Minister, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to consider the resumption of normal relations, and&quot; to suggest that the Soviet Government should send a representative to London to discuss the necessary preliminaries. The discussion of conditions would then take place in London, and it would be unnecessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to disclose their requirements until the negotiations began.Whatever procedure be adopted in opening discussions, the basis of the nego-tiations; if the suggestions made in this memorandum art; approved, would in fact be that the break of 1927 occurred owing to the Russian propaganda and intrigue in this country and that relations are resumed owing to His Majesty&apos;s Government being-prepared to accept the1 guarantees to be offered against a recurrence of such offences.Any such arrangement would no doubt be criticised on the ground that we should give the Russians what they want without any quid&apos;pro quo for the British creditors and claimants. The position of the claimants would, however, not really be prejudiced by returning to the state of affairs which existed up to Ma)&apos; 1927, and, if any oppor-tunity should occur for entering, with any hope of success, on negotiations for such arrang-ement beneficial to the claimants, the presence of a Soviet representative in London and of a British representative in Moscow would be advantageous rather than the reverse. &apos; The commercial benefits to be derived from the assumption of relations are necessarily a matter of speculation,&apos; but it may at any rate be said that, other things being equal, the Russians will no doubt restrict their orders in this country so long as their doing so serves a political purpose.As regards the status of the diplomatic representatives to be appointed, it seems appropriate to follow the precedent of 1924, and to appoint Charges dAffaires in the first place. The question of the permanent rank of the representatives on each, side cOuld be left!for later consideration.Foreign Office, June 18, 1929,o
