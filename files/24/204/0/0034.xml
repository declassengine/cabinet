0-4 V&quot;iJ L aIS DOCmgNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT,SECRET. CP. 187 (29)CABINET. TRANSFER    OF   MINERS.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.COPY NO.In vie:? of the discussions that are proceeding on the policy of Transfer and Training, I am circulating&apos;a note of my views, together with an Appendix describing the existing Transfer schemes.Y/e are agreed that there is a surplus m king population in certain areas, and principally among those engaged, or hoping to be engaged, in the coal mining industry.    Considerable numbers have moved to other areas, with or without the aid of the Government Scheme, in the past few years, but there is a great deal more to be done. I hope we may be able to do something to revive the absorbing capacity of the distressed areas, but I cannot believe that this will be more than an alleviation of the problem.The plans of the Government have hitherto been largely based on the policy of transfer nnd training - direct transfer where this is possible, and preliminary training so far as this is necessary to enable the worker to move or to improve his chances.   There have no doubt been mistakes, and in such a scheme there must be some mischances.    Briefly, I think that the arrangements made by the late Government need overhauling and extension in various particulars, but I am convinced that the idea is fundamentally sound.1st July. 1929. -ini31ry of Labour^(Intd. )   M, B.
APPENDIX.1. Nearly two years ago it became clear that the coal miningindustry in particular, and probably also the iron and steel industry and the shipbuilding industry, could not expect to give employment in future to the whole of the personnel nominally attached to those industries.2. The contraction of employment was not uniform throughoutthe industry; it did not mean the discharge   of a small number of men at each pit.   It was concentrated in a few areas, the North East, Scotland and South wales, and a part of Lancashire, being more affected that the Midlands and Yorkshire.   Not the whole of the Northumberland and Durham or South Wales coalfields were equally affected, but in each of them there were a number of small areas where the pits were old and expensive to work, and it was in these small areas that the problem was most acute. 3, When %he Industrial Transference Board was appointed inJanuary, 1928, it examined the situation on the spot, consulting mine owners and Trade Union leaders.4. There was no difference of opinion that the industry couldnot hope to absorb all the men who were then unemployed.   Everything that has since happened in the eoal industry has confirmed this view. 5. Nor was there any likelihood that other Industries of the type requiring &quot;heavy labour&quot; would be started in most of the areas chiefly affected, at any rate to a degree sufficient to absorb the unemployed.6,        What was to be done?   Whatever else was attempted, it was quite certain that, with or without Government help, the younger and more active men would leave these areas and try to find work elsewhere, either in other coalfields or other industries. &quot;Transfer&quot; had indeed started long before the report of the Transference Board, but in an unregulated manner that caused unnecessary hardship.    It could be made a policy through the medium of the Employment Exchanges.A-
7.     But whore could the men be transferred?   There Is not universal &apos;unemployment1 in all areas and all industries, in the same sense as there is unemployment in Bishop Auckland, in Motherwell, in Merthyr Tydfil or Wigan.   The South and Midlands are relatively prosperous.   The insured population of London has increased by 10 per cent In 5 years, while unemployment has fallen from 9.8   to just over 5 per cent.8.     Five per cent of unemployment in London does not mean the same as 5 per cent, of unemployment in a colliery village where there is virtually only one employer, the colliery.   At least half the &quot;unemployment&quot; In any week In London represents merely a brief transition between jobs; the turnover of the register of the London Exchanges is very rapid, and much of the remainder represents persons who for reasons of age, physical defects, etc. are unable to get employment locally notwithstanding a demand for labour. 9.     This is not true of all districts of London; some have more serious unemployment.    But London is broadly one industrial area, owing to its good communications, and men regularly work In parts of London .away from their home area.10.     There is similar good employment in many growing industrial centres outside London, e.g.  vatford, Chelmsford, Wycombe, Oxford, Slough, etc. and in districts In the Midlands.    In most of these areas there are some unemployed, (though relatively few who are chronically unemployed) but they are not of the type required by . the employer.   For obvious reasons many employers prefer a local man, provided that he is of the type they want.   But they cannot be compelled to employ looal men,10.   And into each of these prosperous areas there is a steady flow of &quot;foreigners&quot;, coming in on the chance of work, or in most cases,to work found for them through friends or relatives.11.   The transfer policy follows these natural industrial tendencies.Each week the Exchanges In the prosperous areas offer to the depressed areas five or six hundred vacancies.  (Each week there are about120,000 labour engagements - many of course being merely a re-/engagement
0 i Q *J x Uengagement by the old employer).   The depressed areas call for volunteers, and from the numbers who volunteer, nearly always In excess of the vacancies, suitable men are selected.    Pares to the new district are advanced, clothes are provided by the Local Distress&quot; Fund Committee, and at the Exchange in the new area the men receive any unemployment benefit due to them up to date, and may also have an advance against their first wages. They are also givenlists of available lodgings near their new job and in many cases are taken to the lodgings.12.        Married men, who would like to transfer their families into tbe new area if they become established in work, can obtain a temporary lodging allowance of 12s a week, to enable them to send money home, while they are looking for accommodation for their family.       When they find accommodation tbe cost of removing their family and furniture is paid as a free   grant, and they rseelve any balance due to them of thair original &apos;lodging allowance&apos; grant. 13. There is a further part of the direct transfer policy whichhas caused some misunderstanding.       Some of the vacancies notified to the Exchanges have to be filled 3&quot; quickly that there would not be sufficient time to bring a man dnwn from the North, but If he were were present in the area, he would be accepted.       In a few areas, therefore, where the demand for lab-ur Is steady and expanding, men who volunteer are brought down, not to a specific vacancy, but to report to the Exchange who will find them work promptly.       This scheme which only af tects 40 or 50 men a week, has naturally to be worked with care.       In a few cases, mistakes have been made by the Exchanges, In others unforeseen circumstances have prevented the Exchange offering the man Immediate employment.       Put In the great majority of  cases men are fixed up in work the day after their arrival, and there has been little difficulty in finding men of a good type willing to come forward on these terms.       Where there is a breakdown In the arrangements, and employment cannot/be
be found the man is sent back without caarge to himself. 14.        The above relates to the direct transfer scheme which has been responsible for about 18.5QO of the 26,000 men, boys and, women transferred since last August when the late Government made Its appeal for co-oporatlon In helping the men from the depressed areas to regain employment.       Of these 26,000 about 80 ps r cent, are known to become effective transfers, i.e. the men have become absorbed into employment in a new area, the others have returned either to work in the local pits or to unemployment.15. In addition there is the scheme of training centres for young men   who have six months instruction as handymen.       Since last August 3,000 have been transferred.16. Recently a scheme has been started for giving men whoseemployabillty has suffered through long unemployment, a course of labouring work, from which they are transferred to ordinary labouring work in various parts of the country.       This has not yet been in operation long enough to produce substantial results, but it will undoubtedly be of great value to the depressed areas. 17. Thnre are further the very successful arrangements for transferring boys from the depressed areas, over 2,000 having bean moved since August.18.        Through the training schemes for women undertaken by the Central Committee on women&apos;s Training, 1,150 women and girls have been transferred since August 1928.
