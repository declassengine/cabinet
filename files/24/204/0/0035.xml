[This Document ifi the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govarnmant.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1929.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 188 (29).29CABINET.INTER-IMPERIAL TRADE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I ANNEX a complete copy of the telegram from Sir William Clark, our High Commissioner in Canada, the substance of which I communicated to the Cabinet at our last meeting (see Cabinet Minutes 26 (29), Conclusion 3).It will be seen that the Canadian Government have sounded the Governments of the other Dominions regarding the best methods of developing Inter-Imperial trade, and that a suggestion for calling an Inter-Imperial Economic Conference has been under discussion by the Canadian Cabinet.It seems quite possible that Mr. Mackenzie King may ask Sir William Clark soon for some expression of the views of the British Government on the latter suggestion. In any case, the point is likely to come up during the visit of the Lord Privy Seal to Canada. Hence I think it would be wTell for the Cabinet to have, at any rate, a preliminary discussion with a view to settling the line which should be taken by Sir W. Clark, should he be approached.At the moment I need only observe that a Conference with Dominion repre-sentatives is due to meet in London at the beginning of October to discuss various matters outstanding from the Imperial Conference of 1926 on the legal and constitutional side (I expect to be circulating to my colleagues a memorandum on this subject shortly). It would, I think, be inconvenient that there should be two Inter-Imperial Conferences going on concurrently, one in London and one (presumably) at Ottawa.The Memorandum asked for by the Cabinet on Empire Trade generally will be circulated later.P.Dominions Office, July 2, 1929.Canadian Proposals for Development of Inter-Imperial Trade.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner in Canada for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated 24th June, 1929. No. 152 of 24th June.   Repeated to Washington, No. 14.The Canadian Government have thought it advisable to counteract Conservative leader&apos;s speeches calling for increased tariffs against goods from United States and an Imperial Economic Conference, by adumbrating a bolder policy of Imperial Preference, with a view to stimulating Empire trade as an off-set to losses resulting to Canada from United States tariff proposals.Minister of National Revenue, Minister of Justice, and Minister of Public Works spoke on these lines last week, but, naturally, in very general terms.[19534]
Minister of Finance last Saturday informed the Press that the Governments of all Oversea Dominions had been sounded recently by the Canadian Government regarding the best methods of developing Inter-Imperial trade.The Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs to-day states that the idea of calling an Inter-Imperial Economic Conference of the Governments of the Empire was discussed at length at two meetings of the Cabinet held last week, but that he   &quot;* has so far received no instructions to take the action outlined by Mr. Eobb as reported above.   He gave the impression that such instructions might be shortly received.A significant and apparently semi-official statement is published by &quot; Montreal Gazette &quot; from its correspondent in Washington, to the effect that the United States Administration is well-informed of the trend of Canadian opinion, and that it is quite unlikely that action will be taken by the President to modify Congress recommendations.See my despatch No. 134 of 19th June.
