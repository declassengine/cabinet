[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1929.SECRET. Copy No.     34CP. 190 (29).CABINET.HOME  PRODUCED  MEAT  FOR  THE  FORCES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WITH reference to the Minister of Agriculture&apos;^ memorandum CP. 185 (29), I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum which I have received from the Australian and New Zealand Section of the Imported Meat Trade Association Incorporated.I received a deputation from this body on the 24th June, and I undertook that the representations which they made to me would be taken into consideration before a decision was reached. I therefore circulate for consideration the enclosed memorandum, which has been submitted by the Association as embodying the points advanced by the members of the deputation.P.Dominions Office, July 2, 1929.Points represented by the Australian and New Zealand Section of the Imported Meat Trade Association Incorporated in re the Proposal to use only Home-Killed Beef for the Navy, Army and Air Services between October and March.THAT the English Farmer will not benefit to any appreciable extent, only the Irish Farmer and the Contractors are likely to get any real advantage.Experience shows that up to the present it has never been found practicable to grade home-killed beef owing to the multiplicity of slaughtering-places and the great variety in quality of supplies and of Users&apos; requirements.A standard for Government use could not be secured without an elaborate and costly system of expert inspection and supervision.The ultimate chief source of supply in the past under similar conditions was Irish grasser cattle, which, being of a distinctly lower quality, compete very little with properly-matured English and Scotch beef, and there will undoubtedly be the same result again. In fact, the tendency will rather be to force up the price of store stock to the English grazier - also, it has to be borne in mind that in dealing with Government on a product not standardized there is usually room for a much wider margin of profit for the Contractor.2. That Argentine Chilled beef, not frozen beef, controls the price of home-killed beef, and any increased use of home-killed meat is immediately offset by increased shipments from Argentina and the market price kept at the old level.The real competitor and price-controller of home-killed beef is best quality Argentine chilled beef, of which regular quantities are marketed weekly (see Appendix A). Should the operations of the Contractors for Government supply at any time tend to shorten supply and raise the price of home-killed meat, extra space will undoubtedly be allotted for Argentine chilled beef and full advantage taken of the situation to increase the marketings of chilled beef to the full extent to which the market can absorb it at approximately the old average price level.The Republic of Argentina showed in war-time that at higher prices she&apos;could raise almost unlimited supplies of high quality beef.

3. That the only certain result will be the increase of the cost of the Services to the Exchequer by at least  300,000, and the drawing in of increased quantities of chilled beef for civil supply, for which we shall pay to Argentina perhaps  450,000.Dominions&apos; frozen beef supplies last year cost the Government about 5d. per pound delivered. Home-killed beef averaged, wholesale on Smithfield Market for the period October to March, 1928-1929, Sd. to 8-id. per pound; on this basis the additional cost to the Exchequer could not be less than  300,000 for the six months.In the final outcome, therefore, by the drawing in of extra Argentine chilled beef to replace the Government purchases of home-killed, the bulk of the payment for home-killed beef will, in effect, go out again to South America for chilled beef to the value of perhaps  450,000, the only difference to the British Producer being that a substantial portion of his product may be diverted from normal permanent channels of consumption to the narrower and more variable one of Army Supply.4. That frozen beef being killed under veterinary inspection and strictly graded to well-known standards of quality under Government supervision at the Freezing Works, also closely graded for weight, is pre-eminently suitable for Navy and Army supply. The experience of the Contractors to the Military Camps is that requirements cannot be gauged accurately enough from time to time to enable fresh meat to. be used regularly unless there is to be a great waste or abnormal expense in drawing in supplies from a wide area, whereas frozen beef can be drawn from sf;ore at a moment&apos;s notice in any quantity required, or the quantity reduced sharply at short notice without waste or loss (provided, of course, frozen beef contracts are current and requirements reasonably foreseen).It may be thought that the fact of this beef being so suitable and giving such satisfaction for Navy and Army supplies, it should be equally so for the Civil population, but experience shows that the Government Commissariat Officers and Institutions connected therewith quickly learn how to thaw and handle the frozen article to get the best out of ft; whereas the Civil population, accustomed to home-killed or chilled beef, will not take this necessary trouble. Efforts have been made to educate the public in this direction, but without any great success, because frozen beef is not so easy to handle for the shop trades as the fresh and chilled article. Australia and New geajand have tried to handle their beef in chilled condition, but the distance and time element are too great a hindrance.5. That the loss of this outlet for the Dominions&apos; beef will have so very serious an effect upon their farming results that large areas of country will be put out of use and the economic situation of a large section of the Dominions will fall back into the desperate position from which they are but just recovering after the post-war slump.Chilled beef has definitely relegated frozen beef to an entirely neglected position for use by the Civil population and also in connection with institutional contracts; apart from a few- shipping supply outlets and country railing orders in the height of Summer, frozen beef &quot;&quot;is roost difficult to sell, even at an. average differential of nearly i\d: per pound (see Appendix C).From, these circumstances it will be seen that the use of frozen beef for the Services from October to March is vital to the very existence of the Dominion beef shippers, their supplies come forward chiefly to arrhre in England from July to December. During the last three years, the Government has taken approximately on average 200,000 Australian quarters out of the total arrivals in Great Britain of about 500,000 quarters (see Appendix B). The Government purchases, however, are all of Prime quality ox beef of selected contract weights, and represent approximately 60 per cent, of this best quality frozen beef. The second quality beef and cow7 beef, making up the balance of the shipments, go to the very poorest trade, to factories, and to certain Continental ports by transhipment. The British Government has given preference of a very appreciable nature to Empire beef for approximately five years, a consideration which, has been most heartily appreciated by&apos; Australian and New Zealand producers as. helping them a little towards getting through the severe ppst-war depression, which affected them to an extreme degree. To put the proposed regulations in force in reversion of the previous policy is to give such a setback to the production of Dominion beef as will put very large areas of country in Australia completely out of production. As mentioned above, it has only been, with difficulty that the surplus above Government requirements has been marketed this, last two or three years, and Government Contractors have had their interest centred in. this beef by their requirements for Government contracts, and having to carry stocks all the

If Government contracts are no longer in prospect, this incentive will be removed and the marketing problem for the frozen beef shipper further aggravated. &apos; 116. That the Announcement of the proposed action came so late as to inflict great hardship upon all Dominion interests concerned.The notice of the possibility of this action by the British Government came at a time when large numbers of cattle and supplies of beef were already in Freezing and Export Companies&apos; hands in anticipation of the usual marketing conditions. This spreads the hardship for this particular season over all sections of the Dominions&apos; export trade, as well as the Producer. It would be greatly appreciated if longer notice of such serious proposals could be given. n7. That Imperial strategic policy dictates the encouragement of Empire sources of beef supply.We would respectfully urge that in consideration of Imperial policy it is of the greatest importance that the beef business should be kept alive in the Dominions, rozen beef has proved a vital factor in war-time, and in consideration of our great hterests in the East, strategy would seem to dictate the wisdom of promoting the rowth of supplies in Australia and New Zealand in every possible way ratheahan he discouraging of it.   Even in Great Britain there will always be the necessity of olding stocks of frozen beef as emergency source of supply; and whilst present conditions of contract prevail, the ordinary course of trade supplies that reserve in he United Kingdom without any expense to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and for emergency overseas it is of the first importance that there be always the potential supply at the source available to Empire requirements at short notice.
