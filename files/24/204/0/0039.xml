[This Document is the Property of Hte Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1929.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.127CP. 192 (29).CABINET.THE OPTIONAL  CLAUSE.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a paper which has been prepared in the Foreign Office, dealing with the Optional Clause and possible reserves. It will be found convenient to begin the study of the paper by reading the draft form of signature which comes at the end of the paper in paragraph 72. The position with regard to the various reserves which have been suggested is discussed in the earlier part of the document.I would have preferred that Great Britain should sign the Optional Clause unconditionally. The above formula proposes various reservations. I think the Cabinet can safely accept all the earlier parts of this formula. I am doubtful, however, about the last paragraph. This paragraph contains an important reser-vation of substance, and would introduce a new and undesirable form of procedure in connection with the submission of international disputes to the Permanent Court.. On both grounds I am not sure whether it can be approved.What is known as the &quot; Optional Clause &apos;&apos; is the instrument drawn up in 1920 in pursuance of the following provision in article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice for signature on behalf of States or Members of the League: &quot; The Members of the League of Nations and the States mentioned in the Annex to the Covenant may, either when signing or ratifying the Protocol to which the present Statute is adjoined, or at a later moment, declare that they recognise as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, in relation to any other Member or State accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in all or any of the classes of legal disputes concerning (a) the interpretation of a treaty;(b) any question of international law;(c) the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation;(d) the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of aninternational obligation.The declaration referred to above may be made unconditionally or on condition of reciprocity on the part of several or certain Members or States, or for a certain time.In the event of a dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction, the matter shall be settled by the decision of the Court.&quot;2. States which have signed the Optional Clause have done so in varying terms, but the model form which is annexed to copies of the Statute of the Court is as&quot; The undersigned, being duly authorised thereto, further declare, on behalf of their Government, that, from this date, they accept as compulsory ipso facto and without special convention, the jurisdiction of the Court in conformity with article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court, under the following conditions: &quot;4957   [19548] bA. H.Foreign Office, July 3, 1929.The Optional Clause and Possible Reserves.follows :
3. The terms of article 36 have been regarded as admitting the making of a reserve or exception of any kind when accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, because the jurisdiction of the Court may be accepted &quot; in all or any &quot; of the classes of legal disputes enumerated.4. Only one State (Haiti) has signed the Optional Clause unconditionally; all the rest (twenty-two up to March 1929) have attached conditions of some kind,&quot; such as a time limit or reciprocity or the exclusion of disputes as to the past, &amp;c.5. Since 1924 the question of compulsory arbitration for international disputes has been intermittently under consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and during the last two years has been receiving close attention. It has been the subject of correspondence with the Governments of the Dominions.6. The question was discussed at the Imperial Conference in 1926, and all the Governments there represented came to a general agreement that none of them would take any action in the direction of the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court without bringing up the matter for further discussion.7. In December 1927 the Government of the United States of America com-municated the draft of a bilateral arbitration treaty which that Government would be willing to conclude with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Since that date the arbitration treaties with France, Italy and Spain have run out, and it has been in connection with the reserves and exceptions which it would be necessary to make in these treaties that the subject has been under close consideration during the last two years.8. Treaties in terms practically identical with the draft put forward by the United States Government have been concluded by the United States with France. Germany and eighteen other States, while negotiations for the conclusion of similar treaties are in progress with some dozen other States. These treaties all contain certain exceptions or reserves of considerable importance. Observations with regard to them will be found below in the sections devoted to particular exceptions or reserves which might be attached to the signature of the Optional Clause on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.9. Compulsory arbitration is one of the subjects upon which for some time past an effort has been made to ensure that all the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should follow a uniform policy. To this principle it is important to adhere, and, therefore, it may be found well to concur in certain exceptions or reserves to which the Dominion Governments attach particular importance, even though they do not relate to points which are of great moment to this country.10. Before dealing with particular reserves or exceptions which might be made, it is well to draw attention to the fact that most bilateral arbitration treaties provide for the conclusion in respect of each case to be arbitrated of a &apos;&apos; special agreement or &quot; compromis &quot; which states the question at issue and settles the terms of reference. No such special agreement is necessary where the parties to the dispute have signed the Optional Clause. Proceedings in the latter case can be begun at the instance of either party to the dispute, the point at issue becomes defined in the course of the proceedings, and no opportunity arises for coming to an agreement with the other party to the dispute as to any special rules which the court is to apply in giving its decision.11. It is the absence of this special agreement or compromis which constitutes the chief difference between the system of international arbitration in.vogue during the pre-war period and the system of obligatory judicial settlement of international disputes rendered possible by the establishment of an international court always in being and possessing fixed rules of procedure. Most States, in concluding bilateral arbitration treaties during recent years, have shown their belief in the advantage of having a compromis or special agreement in respect of each dispute, and have made provision in the treaty accordingly, though in many cases power is given to the tribunal to fix the compromis if the parties cannot agree a system initiated in Convention I drawn up by the Second Peace Conference in 1907 ; sometimes it is given to a conciliation commission; and in some cases, if no agreement can be reached on its terms, the compromis can be dispensed with. This last was the system adopted in the Locarno arbitration treaties of 1925. Great Britain has, as a rule, inserted in her arbitration treaties a provision requiring a compromis to be concluded The United States of America have done so in all the treaties by which they are bound.
Hitherto the Senate have insisted upon this, as they maintain that the compromis must be regarded as a treaty and be submitted to the Senate for its consent before ratification.12. A reserve or exception with regard to a particular class of disputes made when signing the Optional Clause need not exclude arbitration in virtue of a special agreement in respect of any or all of the disputes comprised in that category; it need not even exclude the acceptance of an obligation to arbitrate upon terms such as those embodied in the treaties concluded by the United States providing for the conclusion of a special agreement in respect of each case submitted to the tribunal.13. As will be seen from the subsequent paragraphs of this paper, there are some cases in which arbitration would involve substantial risk unless an agreement can be come to as to the rules by which the arbitration tribunal is to be guided. In this respect acceptance of the Optional Clause might reasonably be accompanied by a reserve which would not be necessary where a &apos;&apos; compromis &apos;&apos; was to be concluded in respect of each particular arbitration.Time Limit.14. Fifteen States, in accepting the Optional Clause, have attached a time limit to the operation of their signature. This has usually been five or ten years; in two cases it has been fifteen years.15. An irrevocable commitment is undesirable; consequently, the insertion of a time limit seems wise. On the other hand, there are inconveniences attaching to an arrangement which required a renewal of the signature at the end of the period, and it would, therefore, seem desirable that if His Majesty&apos;s Government sign the Optional Clause they should merely reserve the right to withdraw after some definite period, e.g., fifteen years. In the absence of withdrawal the acceptance would remain in force.16.   An arrangement on these lines is practically equivalent to a permanent commitment, as, unless there had been some change in the circumstances, withdrawal &apos; from the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court would be regarded as a retrograde measure, and a Government would hesitate to take it.D   - Particular Exceptions or Reservations.Reciprocity.17. The terms of article 36 of the Statute are somewhat inconsistent on the subject of reciprocity. The earlier part of the article implies that the principle of reciprocity will always operate; the penultimate paragraph shows that the clause can be accepted unconditionally, i.e., without reciprocity. It follows that if the jurisdiction is to be accepted on a basis of reciprocity, it must be so stated. Twenty-two out of the twenty-three States which have accepted the Optional Clause have done so upon this basis.18. There is a further reason for attaching this condition of reciprocity. To refrain from doing so would make it advantageous for other States not to sign the clause themselves. If no condition of reciprocity is attached by a State to its signature, another State can cite the first State before the Court and itself remain free from any corresponding liability to be cited before the Court.Inter-Imperial Questions.19. In the course of the correspondence with the Dominion Governments, Australia has suggested that a reserve should be made excluding inter-Imperial disputes.20. No such reserve is desirable, not because the Court of International Justice should be competent to take cognisance of any such dispute, but because, to make such a reserve, would imply that in its absence an inter-Imperial dispute would fall within the jurisdiction of the Court.21. According to the view held by this Government, the Court only has jurisdiction in international disputes, and a dispute between two units of the British Empire is not, and cannot be, in the strict sense of the term, international.   The[19548J b 2
common allegiance to the Crown and the association together of all the autonomous units of the Empire of the British Commonwealth of Nations renders the relations between those units different from the relations between any one of those units and a foreign State. It is with a foreign State only that their relations are international, and it is disputes with a foreign State which alone are international and fall within the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at The Hague.22. The view that the relations between the various units of the Empire are different in character from the relations between any one of those units and a foreign State was fully understood by the Imperial Conference of 1926, and much of the work of that body was based on that principle. No Dominion is likely to contest it, or to make any attempt to refer to the Court at The Hague a dispute with this country. On the other hand, to invite formal concurrence in any explicit statement that the International Court has no jurisdiction in inter-Imperial disputes would create difficulties for some of the Dominion Governments and it would be better to refrain from doing so. The view held by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is well known, and has been publicly stated at Geneva. In the communication to be made to the Dominion Governments it should be explained that, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Court can have no jurisdiction in inter-Imperial disputes, and that, for this reason, it is not proposed to attach any such reserve as Australia suggests to the acceptance of the Optional Clause.Questions within the Domestic Jurisdiction of one of the Parties.23. In theory, any such exception or reserve in an arbitration treaty is superfluous. Matters of domestic jurisdiction are matters wdiich by international law are left exclusively to the jurisdiction of the sovereign authority of the State. Where that is the case, no foreign State is in a position to contest the decision arrived at.24. Nevertheless, it has become a matter of common practice to include this exception. It is inserted in all the recent treaties concluded by the United States (&quot;The provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute the subject matter of wThich (a) is within the domestic jurisdiction of either of the High Contracting Parties.&quot;); and the &quot; General Act &quot; drawn up at Geneva in 1928 admits in Article 39 (2) b the formulation of a similar reserve. Such matters as the immigration policy and the control of raw materials fall within the domestic jurisdiction, and they are matters upon which Dominion Governments are so nervous of foreign interference that it probably would go hard with them to omit this reserve when signing the Optional Clause.25. If a bilateral arbitration treaty were concluded with the United States, it is certain that it would have to include this reserve, as to omit it would be to risk the rejection of the treaty by the Senate. Practical considerations, therefore, are in favour of attaching a similar reserve to the acceptance of the Optional Clause if the Dominion Governments manifest any wish for it.26. No State in accepting the Optional Clause has up till now excluded disputes on matters falling within the domestic jurisdiction of the State, but the explanation of this may be that most of the States wdiich have accepted the clause are continental States to which this question is not one of great importance.Disputes involving Third Parties.27. Since the Anglo-French Arbitration Convention of 1903 arbitration treaties have almost always included an exception excluding from the obligation to arbitrate disputes involving the interests of third parties. The model draft treaties prepared by the Security Committee of the League of Nations in 1928 dealt with disputes involving the interests of third parties in a different way. The framers of those treaties regarded the interests of the third party State as sufficiently protected by the right which articles 62 and 63 of the Statute of the Court give to every State which has an interest in the case to intervene in the proceedings; consequently, the interests of the third party State being sufficiently protected themselves by the right to intervene afford no reason against the judicial settlement of the point at issue between the two States primarily concerned in the dispute. The &quot;General Act&quot;&apos; approved at Geneva in 1928 proceeds (article 36) upon the same basis.
28. In view of the terms of articles 62 and 63 of the Statute, it seems to be unnecessary to attach to the acceptance of the Optional Clause any reserve or exception as regards disputes involving the interests of third parties.&quot;Monroe Doctrine.&quot;29. All the arbitration treaties concluded by the United States include the following stipulation : &apos;&apos; The provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute the subject-matter of which . . . . (c) depends upon the maintenance of the traditional attitude-of the United States concerning American questions, commonly described as the Monroe Doctrine.&quot;30. Great Britain has special interests in certain areas which are comparable to the Monroe Doctrine, notably in Egypt and the Persian Gulf. The protection of these interests is even more essential to Great Britain than is the integrity of the Monroe Doctrine to the United States of America: For this reason, in 1922 Great Britain made a formal notification to all the Powers that she would regard any intrusion on the independence of Egypt as an unfriendly act. In 1903 Lord Lansdowne, in a speech in the House of Lords, made it clear that we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal. This declaration was repeated in substance by Sir E. Grey in 1907.31. If in a bilateral treaty with the United States the Monroe Doctrine was to be formally recognised to the benefit of the United States and disputes involving it were to be excluded from arbitration, it seemed reasonable that the United States should be called upon equally to recognise the special British interests in spheres of particular importance to our Imperial communications, such as those indicated above. Accordingly, a revised formula was elaborted to replace article 3 (c) of the draft American Arbitration Treaty. This formula was intended to cover both the American Monroe Doctrine and its British counterpart and was worded as follows : &apos;&apos; The provisions of article 2 shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute the subject-matter of which-(c) depends upon or involves the maintenance of the policy proclaimed in the past by either of the High Contracting Parties in relation to particular areas wherein such party possesses special interests which it is bound to uphold in the interests of its security.&quot;32. There is this difference between the case which was then under considera-tion and that which arises in connexion with signing the Optional Clause. The Monroe Doctrine would be used to justify American action to prevent coercive measures against, followed by control over, the territory of a Latin American State. The inclusion of an exception in terms such as those quoted above in a treaty with the United States would not prevent arbitration of the original subject-matter of the dispute between the European State desirous of taking the coercive action and the Latin American State concerned, if there were in force between them an agreement, bilateral or general, covering the arbitration of such a dispute. The exception would only exclude arbitration with the United States as to the legality of any action taken by it for the purpose of upholding the Monroe Doctrine.33. If the Optional Clause were signed with a reserve excluding compulsory submission to the Court of disputes arising out of action taken to uphold the special interests of this country in areas such as Egypt or the Persian Gulf, the reserve would operate to exclude, not only arbitration between Great Britain and a third State, whose attempts at interference Great Britain could not tolerate, but also arbitration between Great Britain and the territorial Power concerned, i.e., Egypt or Persia, as to the legality of the action -which Great Britain had taken vis-a-vis that Power for the purpose of upholding her special position.34. The operation of such a reserve would, therefore, be wider if attached to an acceptance of the Optional Clause than if inserted in a bilateral treaty with the United States. But where, as shown below, there is no secure legal basis for our claim to occupy in certain countries a special position, through which alone we can ensure the protection of our lines of communication to India and the East, it would be dangerous for the reserve tohave the more restricted scope.
35. The similarity between the American Monroe Doctrine in respect of Latin America and the British Monroe Doctrine in respect of Egypt and the Persian Gulf must not be pushed too far. In Egypt and Persia the problem is still essentially one of defence; in Latin America it has ceased to be so, except as regards the Caribbean area, and is now primarily a sentimental and economic question. Great Britain&apos;s special position in Egypt and in the Persian Gulf rests on no secure legal basis, and might well stand in jeopardy if it were subjected to scrutiny in a judicial tribunal. It is the knoAvledge that this was the case that has made the conclusion of a satisfactory treaty with Egypt the constant aim of the Foreign Office since the&quot; Protectorate was terminated. Though efforts have been made in the past, and though perhaps another may be made in the immediate future, it has hitherto proved impossible to secure from Egypt the minimum safeguards that such a treaty must contain. In resisting our requirements, Egypt has always sought to enlist foreign support, just as we have sought to exclude foreign intervention in what is a matter for settlement between Great Britain and Egypt. Once Egypt sees the possibility, however remote, of getting these questions referred to outside arbitration, the chances of concluding a treaty settlement with her will disappear. No Egyptian Government would be likely to expose themselves to criticism by giving treaty sanction to a British claim if it became apparent that by the exercise of a little ingenuity it could attain its object by arbitration.36. The position in the Persian Gulf has recently been under review by a sub-committee of the Imperial Defence Committee, and their report demonstrates the defence aspects of the Persian Gulf problem and its importance from the point of view of strategic considerations and Imperial communications.37. However strong the justification for the British position in Egypt and the Persian Gulf may be on the political side, its weakness on the legal side is generally known in well-informed circles, and the acceptance of an obligation to submit to arbitration any aspect of it which might come into dispute would be likely to give rise to a vehement political campaign in this country.38. It may be useful to refer to what is said in paragraph 12 above, that exclusion of arbitration initiated by unilateral action under the Optional Clause need not exclude arbitration initiated by a special agreement or &quot;compromis,&quot; in which there would be embodied any special rules or limitations by which the tribunal is to abide. Until relations with Egypt and Persia can be placed on a normal treaty-basis, this may be the least dangerous line to take, and to make it clear that in the case of the arbitration of any such dispute there must be a special agreement or &quot; compromis &quot; in which the terms of reference would be settled.39. Great Britain&apos;s special interests in Egypt and the Persian Gulf are not matters for which Canada, South Africa or the Irish Free State are disposed to admit any special responsibility, and they might well decline to participate in any exception or reservation excluding disputes of this class from their acceptance of the Optional Clause. With India, and far more with Australia and New Zealand, the position is strikingly different : the two last-named Dominions have in the past been almost morbidly anxious over anything which might threaten our position in Egypt, and consequently our ability ourselves to ensure the protection of the Suez Canal.40. It will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs that there are three possible alternatives, and it will be for the Cabinet to decide which of them to adopt (a) to make no reserve at all and allow arbitration unreservedly. It is feared that this will reduce to vanishing point the chances of a treaty settlement of our relations with Egypt, which, as generally recognised here and by ail sane elements in Egypt, is the only one that can establish these relations on a basis of goodwill;&quot;(&amp;) to make an unqualified reserve and exclude arbitration altogether. The objection to this is that it would run counter to the policy and declarations made by His Majesty&apos;s Ministers before they came into office; . (c) to make a qualified reserve subordinating, until such time as the position can be regularised by treaty, the obligation to arbitrate to the conclusion of a special agreement or compromise. This is the alternative adopted in the draft declaration at the end of this paper. It is avowedly a corn-promise, but goes some way to meet the objections on either side.
Disputes arising out of Belligerent Action at Sea.41. Great Britain is so dependent on sea power for her security that it has for a long time been the policy of successive British Governments not to accept any obligations to submit disputes with foreign Powers to international arbitration in terms which might imperil the exercise of sea power in time of war.42. Hitherto the position has been safeguarded by the exception in the arbitration treaties for disputes involving the &quot; vital interests &quot; of either of the Parties. This exception, however, has disappeared from all the recent treaties concluded by the United States and from the General Act drawn up at Geneva, and it is unlikely that any treaties with important foreign Powers containing an exception in these terms could be concluded in future.43. For the last two years efforts have been made to find some satisfactory formula which could be substituted for &quot; vital interests,&quot; but the position has been complicated by the fact that any phrase which could be seen to be intended to cover disputes arising out of belligerent captures at sea and to exclude them from arbitration would foster the agitation conducted by the Big Navy party in the United States, who, for their own interests, contend that British interference with American commerce in time of war can only be prevented by the creation and maintenance of an overwhelming American fleet.   No satisfactory formula has as yet been found.44. Public alarm can very easily be worked up over any proposal that would fetter the hands of the navy in time of war, because the country is dependent for its food supplies on sea-borne commerce and upon the navy for the protection of that commerce in time of war. An unqualified undertaking to submit to arbitration all disputes arising out of naval action in time of wrar would lead to public agitation upon the ground that it must necessarily embarrass the naval forces and endanger the safety of the country.45. The arguments which would be used in any such agitation may be summarised as follows : 46. Naval captures in time of war have, under the British system, to be submitted to the Prize Courts for adjudication, and the Prize Courts administer international law. This system constitutes an ample safeguard for all neutral interests, and renders it unnecessary to submit the decisions of the British Prize Courts to international review.47. To submit these disputes to the International Court at The Hague is to submit them to a tribunal where British interests will be placed at a disadvantage and will not receive fair play. The issue would be one between the captor State and the neutral claimant. Any world court would comprise a preponderance of neutral judges, whose bias would be against the captor.48. Furthermore, there is a cleavage between the Anglo-American school and the continental school of international law as to the rules of sea warfare, and in such a court the men who will have been trained in the continental school will be in the majority.49. Lastly, even if there is&apos; practical agreement . over the fundamental principles of sea law, the disputes arise out of the adaptation of those principles necessitated by developments in conditions of sea transport and sea fighting. Maritime wars, in which considerable economic pressure is exercised by sea, powder, take place only at long intervals, and it is during those intervals that the developments will have taken place which render new adaptations of the old principles essential. The tendency of judges will always be to enforce the observance of the old rules in accordance with the precedents of the past, and consequently there is a risk that an international tribunal would condemn adaptations of the old principles to new conditions, to an extent that will prevent the navy from fulfilling its function of imposing economic pressure upon the enemy. For instance, because Lord Stowell laid it down a century ago that a captor could only rely, in the Prize Court proceedings, on the ship&apos;s papers carried on board the captured vessel, the United States during the late war maintained that the admission in the Prize Court of extraneous evidence in contraband cases was contrary to international law. An international tribunal composed in the main of foreign judges might have been induced to follow Lord Stowell, even though in modern times the ship&apos;s papers afford no evidence whatever as to the destination of the cargo.   If they had done so, the
power of the navy to apply economic pressure would have been at an end and the war would have been lost.50. Arguments of this kind urged on political platforms might produce a formidable agitation and would alarm the public.51. The conclusion of the Kellogg Pact has simplified the situation, and may enable the difficulty to be overcome. As will be seen below, there is reason to think that disputes with foreign Powers over the exercise of belligerent powers at sea will in the future fall into one or other of two groups, and that, as to one group, the risk of arbitration can be faced, and that, as to the other, there is good reason for excluding arbitration by a reserve.52. All parties in this country are now committed to upholding the League of Nations and to the loyal fulfilment of the Kellogg Pact.53. If His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to base their policy upon the assumption that the obligations of the Kellogg Pact will be observed by &quot;Great Britain and by all its other signatories, that, in the event of Great Britain being at war in self-defence, the Council of the League will be able to give effect to article 16 of the Covenant, and that the other Members of the League will act up to their engagements under that instrument, the problem of the arbitration of this class of disputes may be faced upon the assumption that this country will not be involved in war in future except in self-defence, or in pursuance of its obligations under the Covenant of the League.54. In the first case this country will have been attacked and can count on the co-operation under article 16 of the Covenant of all the other Members of the League, and can also count on the issue by the Council of recommendations which should oblige those States to interrupt all economic relations with the Covenant-breaking State. The action of the naval forces will be simplified by the co-operation which His Majesty&apos;s Government may expect from all those Members of the League in preventing intercourse with the country which will have made the attack.55. The only sea-borne commerce which it should be necessary for the British naval forces to intercept would be that which fell outside the operation of article 16 of the Covenant, that is to say, goods on their way from States not Members of the League direct to an enemy port, or to a port in a non-League State contiguous to the enemy country, and, therefore, able to reach an enemy destination without crossing-territory belonging to a Member of the League.56. There is undoubtedly some, but not much, scope for disagreement on questions of principle in connexion with the capture of cargoes destined for an enemy port, and their liability to condemnation, but the risk of arbitration would not be serious.57. As regards cargoes destined for a non-League State contiguous to the enemy, the case postulated seems so improbable that it scarcely affords a serious reason against the acceptance of the Optional Clause. It necessitates the assumption that some State so situated as to be subject to economic pressure by the exercise of sea power will attack Great Britain in violation of the Kellogg Pact and of the Covenant of the League (article 16 or 17), that the United States will endeavour to trade with that State despite its violation of the Kellogg Pact, and that the United States will have signed the Optional Clause. The United States is the only country mentioned in the previous sentence for this reason. By signing the Optional Clause His Majesty&apos;s Government only expose themselves to the risk of arbitration at the instance of another signatory. Only Members of the League of Nations or States mentioned in the Annex to the Covenant are entitled to sign the clause. For His Majesty&apos;s Government to incur the risk of arbitration therefore in this connexion by signing the Optional Clause means that some State or States outside the League, but mentioned in the Annex to the Covenant, in a position to supply commodities to the enemy without making use of the ships or territory of any Member of the League, will have signed the Optional Clause, and will initiate proceedings against His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Court. The only State in a position to do so would be the United States of America, though the cargo carried might conceivably be Argentine. It may be hoped that the United States will not allow American citizens or ships to trade with a country which has attacked Great Britain in violation of the Kellogg Pact.   It is in any case improbable that the United States
will sign the Optional Clause. In any case, the non-League State contiguous to the enemy will not have been qualified to sign the clause.58. In the second case mentioned above, very similar conditions will prevail. In this case, the British naval forces will be taking action, not on their own account, but at the instance of the Council of the League, and in pursuance of the obligation in the Covenant which obliges Members of the League when article 16 comes into play to prevent intercourse between the Covenant-breaking State and another State, whether a Merrjber of the League or not. It is not reasonable that when the British navy takes action in the general interest in accordance with recommendations of the Council, His Majesty&apos;s Government should be exposed to the risk of having the legality of such action questioned before an international tribunal. The complaint as to the legality of such action should be addressed to the body at whose instance the action was taken, viz., the Council of the League.59. The recent arbitration treaties concluded by the United States of America with European States have all included an exception excluding from arbitration disputes involving the observes by the State with which the United States was contracting of its obligations in accordance with the Covenant of the League. The actual terms of this exception are as follows: &quot; The provisions of this treaty shall not be invoked in respect of any dispute the subject-matter of which (d) depends upon or involves observance of the obligations of (the British Empire) in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot;A slight variation of this formula would cover disputes arising out of action taken by British naval forces in time of war in cases where, without being herself the victim of an attack, Great Britain becomes a belligerent in order to co-operate in enforcing the Covenants of the League.60. Arbitration at the instance of another State which has also accepted the Optional Clause of disputes arising out of the exercise of belligerent rights at sea has, therefore, only to be considered in two cases (a) when Great Britain is the victim of an attack.   In this case it is unlikelythat there will be any other State which has accepted the Optional Clause and is entitled to claim arbitration, but, if there is, the dispute will almost certainly arise in connection with goods on a direct voyage to an enemy port, and arbitration can be faced without undue risk.(b) when Great Britain is co-operating under article 16 to protect the Covenantsof the League. In this case there is good reason for excluding compulsory arbitration by a reserve, and the terms of such a reserve will not excite opposition.61. An alternative formula for excluding the arbitration of disputes arising out of belligerent naval action which has frequently been considered during the last two years, and has been suggested independently by the Government of the Union of South Africa, is to exclude all disputes on matters as to which there exists no recognised rule of international law.62. This formula has certain advantages and may be put forward in some quarters as the proper expedient which His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt if they desire to accept an extended obligation to submit to compulsory international arbitration.63. It is open, however, to various disadvantages. It would weaken our present position as to the importance to be attached to decisions in British Prize Courts, because those decisions are based on international law, and it is, therefore, difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to assert at the same time that there is no sufficiently well established rule of international law to justify the risk of submitting the dispute to an international tribunal. Furthermore, a reserve in terms so general might be used to exclude practically every dispute from arbitration.Disputes A rising out of Past Events.m 64. Six States, in signing the Optional Clause, have accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court only in respect of disputes arising out of future events and[19548] c
not out oi past events. It is a reasonable limitation on the engagements to be undertaken. It is also a matter of importance to Great Britain to introduce this limitation by reason of the risk which otherwise would have to be faced of stale claims arising out of action taken during the late war being put forward by countries which then were neutral.Territorial Questions.65. Article 39 2 (c) of the General Act drawn up at Geneva in 1928 foreshadows the possibility of subjecting acceptance of its provisions to a reserve as to disputes relating to territorial status.66. A reserve or exception on these lines to the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court would be valuable to Great Britain in regard to the question of the Falkland Islands. The title to that colony rests on occupation. International law does not specifically admit the principle of prescription, and there is no certainty that if the British title to the Falkland Islands were disputed by the Argentine Government and were submitted to international judicial settlement, the Court might no override the century-long British occupation in favour of the Argentinian claim based on the right of succession to Spain, against whom the populace at Buenos Aires rebelled with success early in the nineteenth century.67. There would be no objection whatever to arbitration of this question provided that some agreement were first come to in a special agreement or &apos;&apos; compromis &quot; as to the length of occupation Avhich should confer a good title, as was done in the Venezuelan Boundary case, wdiere the special agreement with the United States provided that fifty years&apos; occupation should be deemed to confer a good title. The risk involved is that of accepting an obligation to arbitrate without any opportunity of making a special agreement (see paragraph 12 above). It is unlikely, however, that the Argentine Government would be willing to arbitrate the question as to the title to the Falkland Islands upon the basis of an agreed rule wdiich would destroy their own claim.68. The Argentine claim to the Falkland Islands presents various weak points and would perhaps be defeated if submitted to a tribunal. Nevertheless, an arbitration would tend to create ill-feeling between the two countries, and it would be better, if it can be avoided, not to sign the Optional Clause in terms which would entail submitting this dispute to arbitration.69. An exception or reserve relating to disputes arising out of past events could be so worded as practically to ensure the exclusion of this dispute from arbitration, even if the Argentine Government w^ere to sign the Optional Clause. The occupation of the Falkland Islands has already existed for a century, and so long as no change occurs in the situation, it seems unreasonable to regard an acceptance of the Optional Clause as carrying with it the right to contest the validity of the British rights in this colony. Several of the acceptances of the Optional Clause (Germany, Belgium, Spain) are limited to situations or facts subsequent to the acceptance, and there is no reason why the British acceptance should be in more extended terms and should not exclude disputes with regard to facts occurring or situations arising before the acceptance of the clause.Cases where Provision exists for Recourse to some other Mode of Settlement.70. Six States in signing the Optional Clause have excluded cases where there is an agreement to have recourse to some other mode of peaceful settlement. The language employed in making this reserve is wide enough to cover cases where the agreement is for reference of the dispute to a&apos; conciliation commission before submission to the tribunal.71. It is desirable to make this exception Some international disputes which arise are of a special character, and are best dealt with by a special tribunal. Others, again, are too small to warrant submission to the Permanent Court of International Justice, whose activities should be reserved for important cases. This is not a. reserve in any proper sense of the term and need not be worded as such.
