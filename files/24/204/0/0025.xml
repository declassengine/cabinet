THIS DOCUMENT IS. THE. PROPERTYt OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.,SECRET CABINET.0. P. 177(29).BATTERSEA POWER STATION, x . Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.I desire to bring to the notice of my colleagues the position in regard to the objections that have been taken to the erection of the proposed new large generating station on the southern bank of the river in Battersea.Early History.The London P*wer Company obtained, in 1925, statutory powers with a view to the concentration of the generation of electricity for the group of electricity supply companies in West London by the interconnection of their systems and the provision of a new generating station.     With a view to meet the growth in load in that district and to enable loss efficient generating stations to be shut down in due course the companies applied to the Eloctricity Commissioners for consent to erect a station of an eventual capacity of 360,000 k.w. cn a site at Battersea.The Commissioners after public notice, held a Public Luquiry on 21st June, 192 7, at which various objectors wore represented.      The London Gounty Council opposed the application, but as the result of negotiations with tho Powor Company they obtained an agreement with regard to any possible nuisanco, \vhich they considered satisfactory;    and they did not proceed with their opposition.     An agreement was also made with the Battersea Borough Council.     At-the Inquiry little mention was made of the question of fumes which had not then attraoted attention.The Ccmmissloners gave their consent to the erection of the first section of the station of 120,000 k,w, subject to the condition that the Company should, in the construction and
use of the generating station, take the best known precautions for the due consumption of smoke and for preventing, so far as reasonably practicable, the evolution of oxideB of sulphur and generally for preventing any nuisance arising from the generating station or from any operation thereat,The Office of Works, whose approval is required in certain circumstances to the erection of a new generating station in London, informed the Commissioners that they had given their approval to the Power Company on the understanding that the Company would accept the above-mentioned condition. The Commissioners gave their consent on the 27th October,1927.Tn the meantime the Commissioners had prepared and transmitted to the Central Electricity Board their scheme for South East England under the 1926 Act;    and this Scheme provided for two new capital stations, one at Battersea to be erected by the London Power Company and the other at Chiswick to be erected by the London and Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority.     The Joint Electricity Authority had sought power from Parliament in the Session of 1927 to acquire a site at Dukes Meadows, Chiswick, and to erect a generating station thereon.     The Chiswick Scheme was strongly opposed in both Houses of Parliament and the question of possible damage to amenities, especially to Kew Gardens, was raised.   After full consideration by Committees of each House of Parliament and on the facts before them, Parliament authorised the acquisition and use of the site for the purposes of a generating station subject to certain conditions.   Subsequently in adopting the scheme under the 1926 Act, the Central Electricity Board abandoned the proposal to erect a station at Chiswick in favour of the erection of a similar station by the Pulham Borough Council on the site of their existing
station and neighbouring property.    The Battersea and Pulham Stations together with the existing stations at Barking and Deptford are the key*-stone of the South-East England Scheme and a,ny action which might delay or prejudice the bringing into operation of this scheme might have faerious consequences including an adverse effect on employment cRecent revival of the opposition, In 1928 an action was brought against the Manchester Corporation by a farmer who alleged serious damage to his crops as the result of the emission of sulphur dioxide fumes from the chimneys of the Barton Power Station.    The Corporati admitted that the larger consumption of coal in the station had worsened the conditions, tut relied on the claim that they were by Statute entitled -to operate the station. The Corporation won their case in the Lower Court but the Judgment was reversed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The case is now before the House of Lords.    The decision of the House of Lords as to the legal position will not have any practical bearing on the Battersea case,  since the emission of sulphur dioxide fumes was admitted.On 9th April last over important signatures a letter (Appendix I)  of which a copy is attached was published in the Times protesting against the erection of the Battersea Station on the ground of the danger of the emission of sulphur fumes to healthy buildings and works of art in the central area of London,,   The specific suggestion was made that it was unnecessary to build a station at Battersea since it is possible to transmit tho energy from the Jlast Kent coalfields.    Considerable further correspondence followed in the Times and public opinion was considerably alarmed.   The King, whose physician, Lord
Dawson of Penn, had signed the letter, also wrote to the Minister of Health.In answer to a question in the House of Commons the former Minister of Transport stated that the Company were engaged in experiments to carry cut the condition placed upon them by the Commissioners and that he had arranged for the Department of Scientific Research and the Government Chemist to examine the result of those investigations.    The terms of his answer were as fellows:-&quot;In approving sites for power stations regard is, of course, had to the public interest, and opportunity is given for the hearing of any representations made; and no site in the County of London can be approved by the Electricity Commission without the consent of the Commissioners of Works, unless the authority of Parliament has been obtained,,When consent was given to the erection of the Battersea Power Station which is now under construction, an obligation was placed upon the London Power Company to take the best known precuations for the due consumption of 3moke, and for preventing so far as reasonably practicable the evolution of oxides of sulphur, I am assured by the Electricity Commissioners that in this modern power station effective steps can and will be taken to prevent the emission of grit and smoke,   I am also informed that, with a view to compliance with their obligation, the Company have been employing Research Chemists to work on the problem of the elimination of sulphur fumes, and have stated that satisfactory resultshave already been obtained in laboratory experiments,In view, however, of the public interests involved-the Electricity Commissioners, with my approval, have asked the Government Chemist to examine these results, and to keep
-5&apos;263in close touch with the progress of the Company&apos;s investigation.   In conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, he will advise the first Commissioner of Works and the Electricity Commissioners as to the efficacy of the measures proposed to &quot;be adopted to comply with the conditions on which consent has been given to the erection of the new station.The Ministers concerned with the various aspects of the question will remain in consultation with one another, and watch it closelye&quot; The First Commissioner of Works.in the House of Lords on 25th April repeated this atatement and intimated that the Ministers concerned, namely, himself, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport, were keeping closely in touch with developments and gave a definite assurance that the further extension of the electricity generating station to the further two-thirds will not be undertaken, unless it is clearly understood and agreed by the authorities that there is no danger from the health point of view or from the destructive point of view, which,  in the minds of a great many people, follows on the effect of sulphur fumes.   Extracts from Lord Londonderry&apos;s speech are annexed,    (Appendix Ii).The opponents were not satisfied with these statements and correspondence in the papers continued,   A letter was addressed by the Society of British Architects to the Prime Minister and the Westminster City Council passed a resolution to call a conference of local authorities to which they invited the attendance of the London County Council.Present P0sjt..ion0The present position is that the London Power Company have been continuing their experiments both in the Laboratory and at their power station at Grove Road, and will be ready to submit the results to the Government Experts at the beginning
of July.    In the&quot; meantime,  of course, the work on the Battersea Station ia continuing.    It is understood that considerable progress has been made with the foundations and clH.il engineering works generally;    that 20,000 feet of piling has boon driven and shafts sunk i or the river tunnels; that cutting out and repair of the river wall is also in progress and that work on the quipment is being carried out under the various contracts which have been let.Public concern about the erection of this station has been largely due to the belief that the station will emit smoke and grit.    Lord Davidson of Lambeth whose opposition has been an important factor in arousing opinion, in a speech at the Academy Banquet said that here in London they seemed to be content to allow electric power stations to cast the blight of their grit, soot and sulphurous fumes upon the parks and gardens.    In view of the past experience of Chelsea with the Lots Road Power Station and of other places with older stations this concern as to smoke and grit is not unnatural but in the present case it Is unfounded. The Society of British Architects in writing to the Prime Minister referred to complaints about the Fulham Station on this score but on being challenged by the Fulham Authorities admitted that there were no such complaints.The better informed opposition however has been concentrated on two contentions:1. That no means were known for the prevention of the emission of sulphur dioxide at large power stations:2, That modern developments in transmission made a station In the centre of London unnecessary and indeed uneconomic.As regards the first point, the facts are that until the recent action against the Manchester Corporation no serious complaints had arisen with regard to sulphur fumes
9grh) \j t.from power stations and the practical -question of the elimination of such fumes had not arisen,,   While damage \o crops has been admitted by the Manchester Corporation no evidence that the Commis--.! oners are aware of has been adduced to she-.? that any ill-effects are traceable to sulphur fumes in connection with any other power station, although complaints with regard to soot and grit have been made from time to time.    In the report of the Public Health Committee to the London County Council on their meeting on the 18th June,  it is stated that &quot;from enquiries -nade as to the ascertained effect in towns in this country of the fumes of large electricity stations,  it does not appe that conditions of impaired health connected with impurities In the air due to sulphur compounds have so far been observed&quot;.    The Commissioners understand unofficially that this report is based on enquiries addressed to the towns where all the largest- generating stations in the country are situate aIt would therefore appear that many of the views with regard to the effects of a station, even if no precautions were taken, are exaggerated.    At the same time it m.ust be admitted that If the Battersea Station were developed to the full extent, and no precautions at all were taken, the concentration of the discharge of sulphur fumes must have some deleterious effsct on the neighbourhood even If the result on London atmosphere .as a whole were advantageous0    It has always, however, been a condition that the Company,should take such preventive means as are reasonably practicable and the question is as to whether means can in fact be taken and enforced which will reduce the amount of sulphur fumes to such an extent as to render it Innocuous. even when the station is fully developed.
On this point the Company stated in their letter of 15th May to the Times that the advice which they had received offers reliable ground for believing that by the proper selection and pre-treatment of the coal before burning and by the adoption of suitable plant of the best design and lay out it is possible to render practically innocuous any fumes which arise in the process of generation.It remains to be seen whether the reports of the Government Experts on the experiments actually made will confirm this view.    There can be no doubt that by the selection and pre-treatment of coal and by other means it will be possible greatly to minimise the amount of sulphur fumes emitted, and so far as the erection of the first part of the station up to 120,000 k.w. is concerned to reduce emission to a point at which danger to health or buildings need not be anticipated.   The completion of the station to the full 360,000 k,w. and the erection of a similar station at Fulham are in any case held in abeyance until the report of the Government Experts,with regard to the second point as to whether with modern developments in transmission, it is necessary to place these large stations so near the centre of London, the following statement by the Electricity Commissioners was made to the late Government.From such information as the Commissioners have available the tendency in other capitals is to build new large stations in the suburbs, e.g. Issy on the Seine opposite tho Bois de Boulogne, but the large new Edison Station in New York is being erected near the centre of New York and the circumstances vary greatly in each case, . .
9 (5 *7The propriety of sanctioning the site at Battersea for the Central Station required by the London Power Company had to Jbe decided by the Commissioners and Office of Works with reference to the conditions in London and in particular the other sites available, the most suitable of which are on the Lower Thames, e.g. at Dartford.Suggestions have been made, In particular by SirRichard Redmayne, that the best alternatives are in the Kentcoal fields at Richborough or Dover.     The Commissionersunderstand that this view has been pressed on the central electricity Board by an influential deputation of persons interested in the rapid development of the proposed new industrial district in Kent and that prominent industrialistsare anxious to build a station there for the Board.   A capitalstation may be some day required in connection with Kentdevelopment but this question is not immediately relevant to the Battersea Station the whole output of which is requiredfor London,   An alternative site is not at Dover orRichborough between sixty and seventy miles distant, butDartford sixteen miles away0     The Battersea Station hasadvantages over a site at Dartford or elsewhere on the lowerThames which may be summarised under three heads:-1,   Convenience of operating a station in the centre of the loadc2,   Economy in transmission system.3.    Avoidance of physical difficulties in laying mains in London.1. Although a station with the exceptional advantages atBattersea placed right in the centre of the load is a greatconvenience in the operating of a big-interconnected system the Commissioners do not consider this In itself would have any great weight if the oblections on other grounds weresubstantialc
2,     The cost of the additional transmission system required if the Battersea Station had been placed at Dartford is, together with the capitalised value of transmission losses, estimated at  3,000,000 sterling on the basis of 66,000 volt cables and of the order of  2,000,000 if 132,000 volt cables could be employed,    (These are the Company1s estimates, but the Commissioners have examined them and see no reason to question them),     The magnitude of the extra costs thus placed upon the Electricity Industry may be Illustrated by pointing out that this link line would be equal on the first basis to nearly half the cost of the whole of the main transmission system of the Central Board1s south-east England Scheme estimated at  6,000,000 and is very much greater than the cost of the whole of the transmission system of the Central Board in Scotland contracts for which have been let at under  2,000,000.3,     Apart from the cost, the physical difficulty of finding the necessary space for the underground cables in the already overcrowded roads of London is very serious.   For example If the load to be generated at Battersea in 1933 has to be carried by underground cable, 36 separate 66,000 volt cables would be required;    the road space required for such high tension cables is very large,    Overhead transmission is obviously impossible and the suggestion that cables might be laid in the bed of the Thames is regarded as impracticable by the Commissioners, and they understand from the Port of London Authority that there are strong objections to any such proposals.
Proposed extension of the generating station of the&apos; St,&quot;^qaryleBone Borough&quot;&quot;G ouncITTThe St, Marylebone Borough Council have applied to the Electricity Commissioners for consent to extend their generating station.     This extension is urgently needed by the Central Electricity Board to meet the growing load not only of that undertaking and of the Hampstead Borough Council whom they supply in bulk, but also the demands of other Borough Councils -Islington, Hcrnsey and Finchlcy.     This avoids extensions, otherwise necessary, at those other generating stations.The plant now installed at St. Marylebone is 45,500 k.w, and the extension applied for is 25,000 k.w, which will bring the total k.w. installed to 70,500 k,w,The Commissioners propose to issue their consent but to attach the same condition as to the avoidance of smoke, grit and oxides of sulphur as they did in the case of the Battersea generating station (London Power Company).With the inclusion of this condition as to smoke and fumes which they propose to attach to the condition and to which the Borough Council Engineer takes no exception the Commissioners see no reason for withholding their consent to an extension which is so urgently required and the only alternative to which would be extensions of plant at several other places.Recommendations. 1-.     faith regard to the Battersea Generating Station I suggest that the Government experts concerned should be asked to report as soon as possible after they have been given the necessary data by the Power Company.    It must be recognised that in the meantime the Company is proceeding with its ?/orks.    It seems necessary to bear in mind in this connection that if any special obligations were to be Imposed on the ov;ners of the station with regard to the emission of smoke or fumes or the creation of nuisances, the general question would be raised whether such
25th June, 1929.obligations ought not to &quot;be imposed on other electricity owners in similar circumstances, and even on all undertakings whose operations might cause effects of this kind in more or less degree,2.     That the Minister of health, the First Commissioner of Vsorks and myself should help in consultation on the various aspects of the question and watch it closely,5,     With regard to the proposed extension of the St. Marylebone Generating Station,  I suggest that I may be authorised to inform the Electricity Commissioners thst I do not dissent from their proposal to authorise an extension of this Station subject to the condition to which I have referred,(Intld.)

THE TIMES, TUESDAY, APRIL 9, 1929.

POWER STATIONS IN CITIES DUST AND WASTE CASES.

OBJECTIONS TO BATTERSEA SITE.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

Sir,

It appears to us that the schemes of the Central Electricity Board to erect super generating stations at Battersea and elsewhere in the midst of large towns have been framed without sufficient regard to the welfare of the community as a whole.

We are particularly apprehensive in respect of the station at Battersea for the following reasons:-

(l) The proposed concentration of ? combustion is on a scale unprecedented in this country, and experience at generating stations of similar character but on a much smaller scale with modern appliances eliminating smoke indicates that the emission of large quantities of sulphurous acid causes serious damage to vegetation, besides corroding stonework, ironwork, and other metals and injuriously affecting paintings, coloured fabrics, and the like. It has also been found that the modern methods of burning coal result in the discharge of large quantities of fine dust and grit, which are a serious inconvenience to surrounding residents.

(2) In the case of Farnworth versus Manchester Corporation, recently decided in the Court of Appeal, it was admitted that the Barton power station had caused serious damage to crops for a ? of at least one mile. This on a daily consumption of some ? tons as compared with a minimum daily consumption of 2,000 tons as new proposed at Battersea.
(3)     As the prevailing winds in London are south-west,  the normal flow of fumes from a station at Battersea would take a   line over the Tate Gallery, Lambeth Palace, Gt. James :&apos;s Park, Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, St. Thomas^ Hospital, Whitehall, the National Gallery, etc., while Battorsea Park and Chelsea Royal Hospital are both close to the site of the proposed station.   The corrosion of the stonework of the Houses of Parliament Is known to be due to sulphurous vapoursJ the fumes from Battersea will be far mere corrosive than the present atmosphere.(4)     Th6 riverside is especially susceptible to fog, and when such occurs a great concentration cf sulphurous and carbonic acids will take place.    These acids (the fumes cf which, apart from condensation, are heavier than air) would descend on the surrounding district to the serious detriment of health, vegetation,  and buildings whether cf stone cr brick.(5)     Consequently, it seoms evident that a generating station of this magnitude should not be permitted In sr close to a large town, unless sure provision is made for preventing the emission cf these deleterious gases and for eliminating all dust and grit frcm fluo gases.    It, appears to be doubtful whether sure provision is at present contom-platad cr whether it is even economically possible cn the Battersea sitea(6)     There is a further point to consider - namely, that if such a station were erected and tho damage that is anticipated took place, it is inevitable that injunctions would be sought or claims for damages put forward,   The promoters would, therefore, be faced with the possibility of closure, the certainty of expensive litigation, and
9 ij 9the probability of having to face costly compensation.(7)     In Germany, where large scale electricity production is further advanced than it is In this country, the general practice 3s  to produce the current on the coalfields.   Current of high voltage is transmitted for as great a distance as 300 miles, and In some cases the difficulty of carrying overhead cables through the outskirts of big cities is obviated by laying a cable in the river Rhine - an accommodation which could as readily be provided in the Thames.(8)     With regard to London, there is no nee4 to eopo with any distance approaching 300 miles, because in East Kent, some 60 miles away, there is a coalfield ready at hand, where a generating station on the seaboard could bo so placed that tho prevailing wind would take any fumes out to sea and where any damage done would at least &quot;be a minimum,   A further advantage of a generating station on a coalfield would be the avoi&amp;anco of additional transport of coal and removal of ash at a centre already over-burdened with traffic,(9)     With these considerations in view an&amp;, above all, the danger to our national treasures, to the health and comfort of the near by population and t* tho vegetation of eur parks and open spaces, it seems manifest that the present project is ilL-advised, particularly as there are alternatives which have technical and economic advantages,Fartunately little has yet been done on the Battersea site and, in view of the considerations set out above, we ask the Government to institute an immediate and
searching inquiry into the proposal from all points of view,.Yours faithfully,(Signed)    0.B, CLAPCOTT, Mayor of Chelsea.&quot; E.

APPENDIX II.House of Lords. 25th April, 1929.Extract from speech of the Marquess of Londonderry -I would also like to assure him that this is a matter which is having the full attention of the Minister of Health, the Minister of Transport and myself as First Commissioners of Works, and that we are continually watching this matter from the point of view which the noble Lord has put forward.    He can rest assured that unless we are satisfied, on the advice of the Government Ghemist and also on the advice of the Scientific and Industrial Research Department, that there is no danger accruing from the dispensing of electricity throughout this city, the full scheme, the further two-thirds to which I have alluded, will not be sanctioned.Lord Davidson of Lambeth - You spoke of one-third being done at present?The Marquess of Londonderry - One third is being undertaken now,and this will have the result of eliminating three stations already in existence.    The other two-thirds will be undertaken later on, but before those other two-thirds are undertaken there will be many opportunities for myself and Government Departments to make representations,   The matter will have to come under the purview of Parliament, and I am quite ready to assure the most rev. Lord that unless things are satisfactory the remaining two-thirds will not be undertaken.
