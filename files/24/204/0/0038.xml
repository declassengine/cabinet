Experts&apos; Report raises a number cf different issues, some of a financial and some of a political character and I feel that we oust be careful to distinguish, botween these different issues If we are to Introduce any order and clarity into the discussion*Tlie first group of questions which have to be settled are the purely financial questions relating to the revision of the existing arrangements in regard to the amount of the German annuities and their distribution between the ereditor Governments.The acceptance or rejection of these proposals rests either wholly or at least primarily with tho creditor Governments, and it seems to me logical that the first step in the execution of the Young Report should be a meeting of the Finance Ministers of the creditor Governments to arrive at a decision on these points.    The soi-t of questions that I have in mind are e.gD(a) are the amounts and method cf payment of the proposed.German annuities to be accepted? (u) what powers are to be conferred by the creditor Powers on the Bank as their agent for the collection of reparations?(c) are the proposals about distribution, either of the unconditional payments or of the annuity as a whole, to be accepted?(d) how are tho payments in the current year to be re-distributed between the creditor Governments as contemplated in tho Plan?
0 o oa &amp; Qpossibly also(e) v/hat assurances can be obtained about deliveries -in-kind?The conclusions x*reached by the representatives of the creditor Governments on these points would of course, hare to be subsoruently discussed with and accepted by the German Government insofar as they affect in any way tho liabilities of Germany;    but the caethod cf distribution of the Gorman payments is purely a matter for the creditor Governments axil it is not only unnecessary, but indeed unseemly, that this question should be discussed at a Conference with the Germans present.Y/hen agreement has boon reached between the Creditor Governments and (so far e.s necessary) with Germany on the financial questions, the necessary technical Committees can be appointed to work out the detailed organisms pronosed by the Experts,,    2hese Committees may be expected to occupy a period of six weeks or two months.    In the meantime, the road will be clear for the political Conference to deal with the question of the Bhineland Occupation etcI believe that this procedure will not only prevent confusion between the financial and political issues involved but will expedite the discussion of the political issues and will enable thorn to be settled in the most favourable atmosphereQ
In order to give a clear picture of the programme as I see it, I propose(1) that a meeting of the Finance Ministers of the realtor Powers should be convened at the earliest possible date to consider the purely financial aspects of the Young Report.      The meeting should take place in London;    and we should Invite not only the principal Creditor Powers, but Serbia, Roumania and Greece and (probably)  Poland as Powers entitled to a share of the German annuities.     The United States Government and the Dominion Governments should  also be represented in whatever manner t he y c ons I de r b e s t.-. (2)  If and when the Finance Ministers of the Creditor Governments have reached agreement,  the German Government should be invited to join the meeting and to discuss any points which affect the interests of Germany.      Subject to a general agreement being reached,  the necessary Organisation Committees should &quot;be set up to prepare the detailed organisation of the Bank and the revision of the German Laws, (o) Thereafter the plenary international Conference (Including the Heads of Governments or Foreign Ministers) should be summoned to deal with the political issues involved in the Plan,  such as the Rhine land evacuation,  on a satisfactory settlement of which the German Government will no doubt insist as a condition of their acceptance of the Plan. (4)  The international Conference  (perhaps after an adjournment)  would have eventually to embody in a final Protocol or Treaty the various Agreements; both political and financial, necessar?/ to carry into effect the Plan as a wholen e a s ury C hambers,  S.W.10July 2nd,  1929* P.S.
