1is 6m THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANSI0 MAJESTY&apos;G GOVERNMENT.SECRET. ! CP. 164(89)COPY NO.cabinet trade OUTLOOK.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, minutes of a meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council which took place on June 13th under my chairmanship, together with reports in writing received from some of the members who were not present.I might explain that this Council is a standing body which has been in existence since the end of 1918 and was at that time constituted somewhat on the lines of a pre-war standing committee of the Board of Trade  which had been set up in 1998. It consists of (a) about twenty prominent business men, selected by the President of the Board of Trade, and representative of industry,commerce and finance, each member serving for a period of three years;  (b) three representatives of labour chosen by the president for their knowledge of industrial and commercial questions, also appointed for three years,  the present members are Mr. J.T. 3rownlie (engineering), Mr. A. Pugh (Iron and Steel) and Mr. A.  Shaw (&quot;Jool and Worsted); (c) the presidents for the time being of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of British Industries, and the British Bankers&apos; Association, //ho serve during their year of presidency and for one year thereafter; and (d) representatives of some of the other Government Departments and of the Dominions.    This council meets regularly every month, and was meeting throughout the tenure of office of the previous Labour Government.      Its object is to place at the disposal of the Government of the-1-
day the latest and most authoritative information as to the situation and prospects of British industry and trade.It will be seen from the first page of the attached minutes that Sir Arthur Balfour, addressing me on behalf of the Council, said &quot;You can rest assured of our hearty co-operation to assist You in the very great objects which you have before you&quot;.I propose to continue the practice which has been followed for many years, of circulating regularly to the Cabinet the minutes of the meetings, which also, under a long standing rule, are sent to the Governor of the Bank of England and - through the Dominion representatives on the council - to the Prime Ministers    of the Dominions.I would remind my colleagues that the reports of members are given in confidence and that it is only by assuring members of their strictly confidential nature that I am able to secure frank and full discussion.Regarding.the annexed minutes, I would refer my colleagues to Mr. Warham1a report as to coal;    It will be seen that recent figures as to output, employment and exports are all fairly satisfactory.    The improvement- in iron and steel production is being maintained, at least for the present, and more blast furnaces have been brought into operation. Engineering in general may prove to be slackening, but the electrical branches are in a good condition.-   Turning to textiles, the situation is rather less favourable.    Orders in the cotton trade are not plentiful, but a similar depression is being felt in most other cotton manufacturing countries. In some sections at least of the wool textile trade conditions are reported to be quiet, and there is some apprehension as to the prospects.    Rubber and chemicals appear, on the whole, to be doing moderately well.A lack of skilled workers is reported in certain branches of engineering and in the Nottingham making-up trade.Board of Trade, W.G.26/6/29,

NEXT MEETING.The next meeting of the Advisory Council will take place on the second Wednesday of July - July 10th - at 10 a.m.THE PRESIDENT said: &quot;Gentlemen, I understand that these proceedings are conducted quite informally, hut I should like this morning, as we have had a change of Government in this country, to say a word of welcome to members of the Council. I am not, of course, pretending for one moment to be familiar with the details of the Board of Trade.    The brief experience that I had In 1924 was in the Treasury,    Nevertheless, I am keenly interested in these subjects, and the whole object of the Government is to find methods, during the year or two ahead - whatever the period may be - of constructively contributing to the relief of unemployment and to the improvement of our industry and commerce.&quot;in that spirit I meet you this morning.    I recognise the valuable services you have rendered in this Council, and I have no doubt that they will be at the disposal of this Government as they have been at the disposal of its predecessors.&quot;SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR replied:    &quot;Mr. President, I am sure my colleagues will wish me to say that we welcome you in your Office, and that you can rest assured of our hearty co-operation to assist you in the very great objects which you have before you.    I think you will find that the different industries here do help the Board of Trade with advice and counsel, and it Is a great pleasure to us to do so.    I am sure you can depend upon our cordial co-operation.&quot;  (&quot;Hear, hear&quot;).BRITISH NEWS ABROAD.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR thought it very important that when representative men from this country went over to America and made speeches they should not run down our economic position. He had taken quite   the contrary line.    He pointed out to them their very great facilities, financial and otherwise, and then referred to the fact that we, a nation of 45 millions, were exporting proportionately a great deal more goods than they, with their population of 118 millions.    In all his speeches to the bankers he had put to them what this country was doing, and he thought we would improve our economic position in America very much if people going over there would make such legitimate comparisons as these.   We had a very stupid way of running ourselves down, and in America particularly, where they took you at your own valuation very much, it did not do at all.SIR HUGO HIRST wished to emphasize the point which he had mentioned at the previous meeting of the Council and to which Sir Arthur Balfbur had just referred - that of the
1 i 9j. .1 ij0 confidential.BRITISH NEWS ABROAD (CONTD. ) .despondent reports about our o?/n country which we generally sent abroad.    He had just made an Empire tour, and could confirm what a terrible effect it had to send out so many unemployment figures and dwell so much on the unsatisfactory j, state of trade in the cotton industry or in shipbuilding, or whatever It might be.    Nobody out there heard anything about how we managed a small country like our own and were able to balance a budget of  800,000,000, including social services such as no other country could show.    Nobody knew the virility of the silk industry, the motor-car industry and the electrical industry.    When you told them of these things they cheered up, and it helped business.    He hoped that in the reports which were sent out in future a more optimistic note would be struck.   That would do a lot of good to trade generally.SIR C-UY GRANET, having just come back from America, wished to say how entirely he agreed with Sir Arthur Balfour and Sir Hugo Hirst on the importance of all Englishmen, when they V7ent to America and other countries, waving the flag a little.    He found wherever he went that amongst the people who were most friendly to vis there was a genuine belief - regret-fully expressed, but absolutely accepted - that this country was down and out.    It was almost incredible how universal that belief had become in most countries, but especially in America.    One of the reasons why he found a tour of America, even for ten days, so tiring was that the Americans were great people for making you get up on your legs and saying something about this country.    After every meal they asked you to say something.    He honestly thought that, however imperfectly one could express oneself, one did real good to the country by getting up and pegging away to Americans on the theme that England was not played out.    They were a very receptive audience, and, at any rate for the moment, they believed the truth and a certain amount of good was done.    But it was not only   the moral effect, the atmosphere of compassion that one met, which showed the harm that had been caused.    It was translated Into business, and that was having a bad effect on this country.    Americans were more and more turning to Germany or to France or to Canada as the people with whom they wanted to establish business contacts.   Therefore, he did want to say how much he agreed with Sir Arthur and Sir Hugo, and how much he wished examples such as Mr. Brovvnlie gave to the Council (see section on Engineering), and other examples of that sort, could be memorised by any of us who went abrcsd so that we might instil the true doctrine into the minds of Americans especially.COAL.MR. WARHAM reported that the weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom for the three weeks ended May 25th had practically been over the 5,000,000 ton mark.    In the week ended May 11th it was 5,108,000 tons.  and in that ended May 18th it was 5,273,000 tons.   The next week had been Whitsuntide week and it was only 3,029,000 tons.   The average weekly output for the   eight weeks ended May 18th was 4,955,000 tons, as compared with 4,654,000 tons for the corresponding period last year. That was an advance of 300,000 tons per week.   The number of
confidential.GOAL (CONTD.).persona employed for tiie week ended may 18th was 940,500, or 84.7 per cent, of the 1913 figure.    Unemployment for the month of April was 15.8 per cent., as compared with 13.2 per cent, in biarch, and 21.9 per cent, as the average for 1928,  so that there was a distinct improvement there, though it had not been quite so good as in March.    The output per man had increased considerably of late.Coal exports from the United Kingdom in April amounted to 4,756,000 tons, as compared with 3,722,000 tons In April,&apos; 19 28, and 4,763,000 tons in the previous month of this year. The monthly average in 1913 had been 5,116,000 tons,  so that we were still a long way behind 1913.    The value per ton f,o.b. in April Bhowed a further slight increase, being 16s.3d. as compared with 16s.Id, in March.    Coal exports during the first four months of this year, however,  showed an increase of more than 2,000,000 tons over the corresponding period of last year.    Sweden had taken 200,000 tons more during those four months than she did in that period last year, Norway 119,000 tons more, Denmark 75,000 tons, the Netherlands 165,000 tons, and Belgium 393,000 tons, France 1,020,000 tons and Italy 250,000 tons.    vie had also had a few orders from Australia, amounting to about 25,000 tons, owing to troubles over there.    Germany, however, had taken 210,000 tons less than she did during the corresponding period last year, and Spain 54,000 tons less.However,  this considerable increase of our exports did not mean that we had captured trade from Poland, but that the trade had expanded.    Coal exports by sea from Poland continued to increase,  the quantity shipped in April amounting to the high figure of 679,000 tons.    The average monthly quantity in 1928 had been 597,000.      Germany also showed an increase in her exports of over 100,000 tons.The demand for industrial purposes continued to be good. The seasonal decrease in house coal requirements was causing the usual short-time working in some districts, but there was a tendency to replenish stocks which had been used during the cold weather in February and March.    Durham gas and coking coals were in great demand, and the export trade in general was much improved over last year.    This improvement appeared to be caused by (1) the extra quantity of coal -used in Europe last winter;  (2) a certain gradual improvement in the heavy industries of Europe, and (3; the cumulative increases in cost In Germany, making them less able to compete in the &quot;contested districts&quot;.A difficulty which was beginning to make itself felt in the export coal trade was a shortage of ships.    Many steamers had been taken on time charter by the Russians to bring timber from the White Sea, and there -was considerable detention in loading and discharging.    In addition to this, considerable detention occurred in loading at Polish ports, owing to the heavy pressure they had from arrears of oontracts, and this was making it very difficult to get enough suitable tonnage for the ooal export trade, which was otherwise very good.
COAL (CONTD.).SIR WALTER RAINE wished to Bay, in confirmation of what ^Mr, Warham had said,that the Durham coal trade was booming at the present time.    The price of Wear special gas coal today was 17s.6d. per ton f.o.b. as against 16s.6d. a month ago and 15s.6d. at the end of April.    The situation was considerably affected through the continued strike at Dawdon.    The price of best gas coal, which was unscreened, was high out of all proportion to Northumberland screened steam.    Whenever a situation like that arose, consumers abroad began to turn their attention to oheaper qualities, and that was what was now baking place.    The trade was still coming to Durham, but orders were rather for second-class gas ooals than for best.In reference to what Mr. Warham had said about tonnage, stocks of timber were low throughout the country, and owing to the abnormal amount of tonnage which had been taken by the Russians for the White Sea trade, there was a most insistent demand from the Baltic; and from his own experience in the last four or five weeks, Sir Walter Raine could say that freights forward from the Continent were at least 7s.6d. to 10s. more per fathom for pit-props than they had been at the beginning of May.    The effect was going to be even more Berious on the immediate export trade in coal than Mr. Warham had indicated.   Freights were already at such a height from the Baltic that it paid ov/n6rs to send their steamers out in ballast without bothering about outward freights.    In coke there had been a rise of ls.6d. per ton, and the trade was looking for a rise of Is. per ton in the railway freight, so that, in his opinion, for the next two or three months at any rate, we would have a decrease in the export trade, because the consumer - who after all puts the price and the freights together - would find the amount so high that it would not pay him to stock.MR. MITCHELL remarked that the position of the coal trade in Scotland was not satisfactory, although it was perhaps a little better than at this time last year, and rather higher prices were being obtained.    In the east of Scotland large coal had a fair market for shipment, but smalls were not^ going away freely.    In the west there was a short demand for both large and some classes of small coal, and a good deal of idle time had resulted at the collieries.    Several collieries had been temporarily closed down within the last few weeks, and others were restricting their output. Shipments since the beginning of the year showed some increase over last year; but, as Mr. Warham had said, Polish competition was still severe, and exports from Danzig and Gdynia were higher than last year.IRON AND STEEL.MR. BOND stated that the progress of the iron and steel industry which had been noted in recent months, had on the whole been maintained in May, In the case of pig iron manufacture the number of blast furnaces in operation rose from 15S at the end of April to 158 at the end of ^ay, and there was a
IRON AMD STEEL  (CONTD.).prospect of a few more furnaces being re-lit in June.   The number of blast furnaces now in operation was thus higher than at any time Binoe October 1927.    Complete returns of ^production of pig iron in Lay were not to hand, but it was estimated at about 650,000 tons /Eote: definito figure now received, 654,800 tons/, which was higher than in any month since kay 1927. ;Steel production was estimated, from information at present received, at 840,000 tons in May compared with 808,000 tons in April, 860,000 tons in March and 750,000 tons in May 1928.     The steel industry would naturally be now entering upon a period when trade was generally quieter, but it seemed unlikely that there would be any serious recession in production in the next month or two.     The increased demand for iron and steel had brought about a rise in the prices of raw material, and there had been an increase of 5s. a ton in the price of sections and joiBts, whioh was the first advance since February, 1928.On the north east coast the prospects for the next three months were considered to be satisfactory, although new orders for the shipyards were not so numerous as during the early months of the year.      The tonnage on the order books at the end of ^ay showed an increase over April, but the relative proportions of home and export trade showed a further reduction in export.     Constructional work showed some slight improvement, although difficulty was found in obtaining orders for the heavier sections.     Competition from Continental makers was continuing, though less keen except in the case of joists.Reports from Scotland stated that production had been fairly well maintained, and that while the position could not be said to have improved, there were no signs so far that the level of production which had been maintained since the beginning of the year was likely to become appreciably lower. Difficulties were still being encountered in obtaining supplies of raw materials, and prices for scrap and pig iron had increased.    In contrast with the conditions on the north east coast, Scotland was finding the home market somewhat weak, but export was showing a little more movement.    Summarising the position in Scotland it might be said that there was a slight, although not -very appreciable, falling off in activity.    It &quot;was impossible to say how long the improvement in the steel trade as a whole would last.     It was due mainly to two causes: an improvement in the shipbuilding industry, and an increased activity on the Continent. &apos;In South Wales the tinplate mills were working about 75 per cent, of capacity.    The output appeared to be slightly in excess of the demand and prices sere barely steady.    The present output was at the rate of 800,000 tons a year, of which quantity about 25 per cent. waB consumed at home, and 75 per cent, exported.    40 per cent.of the exports went to the Empire. The fifelsh tinplate manufacturers had an arrangement with the
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).United States under which Great Britain exported 70 per cent, and the United States 30 per cent, of the combined exports of the two countries, and they were negotiating a similar arrangement for oontrol of export trade with German manufacturers.    The sheet trade in South Wales was quiet, and several works were idle owing to demand being insufficient to absorb the large production.    Some Important markets were over-stocked.MR. PUGH said that as regards employment, the result of the improved position of the Industry was rather to increase the amount of work of those already engaged than to increase the number of persons employed.    There was, however, a tendency, particularly, it appeared on the north east coast, to re-start plantB that had been idle, and this would probably have its effect in increasing the number for whom work would be available.    On the whole the position was much more satisfactory than it had been for a very considerable time.MR. MITCHELL reported that in Scotland there had been a fair output in the steel trade, but prospects for some months ahead were not bright, as very few shipbuilding orders had been plaoed, and there wasnct much enquiry for new tonnage.    The cost of production in the steel trade had risen somewhat seriously, and the extra cost was not nearly covered by the advance in price of 5/- per ton which had recently been made.The scrap position in Scotland was a little easier.   Fair supplies were being obtained, but the price had not been reduced.   Pig iron prices had been advanced.    The Committee which was sitting to investigate the scrap position had a very important question to consider, and a very mysterious one. A paper had been circulated at a League of Nations meeting in May on the Silesian iron and steel industry, and in that the local price for scrap was given as equivalent to about 38s.6d. per ton in our money, whereas they were paying for imported scrap, largely British, c.i.f. Danzic,  68s.3d.    If one added the freight from Danzic to Poland it was quite obvious that they must be paying nearly twice the price for the scrap that they were importing as they paid for the local scrap.   Mr. Mltohell did not know the reason for this, and he thought it would be Very desirable that the Committee which had been set up should investigate this part of the question.    It was quite impossible to make steel in Poland at the market price with scrap at the imported price.Imports of foreign steel into Scotland were oontlnuing at a high level, but practically no foreign pig iron was coming In.   Fair outputs were being got in the tube trade.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR reported that the home trade had been generally good.    There had been a slight falling off in the last throe or four weeks, which we generally got at this time of the year.    Summer seemed to affeot that trade, and we had had three very poor months.   As against that we were turning out a tremendous amount of alloy which was being used promptly; and this showed that a large amount of special steel was being produbed.
11NON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTV-LTON observed that the non-ferrous metal trade was quite steady.   The demand for copper showed some improvement, but it might have been expected to be more buoyant, considering the activity of the electrical trade. Undoubtedly, the very high price had affected the demand. Increased competition was noticed from aluminium cable, which was a direct result of the high price of copper.   That cable was entirely American-centrolled.    The demand for tin was satisfactory, but the tiuplate trade was only working at 75 per cent, of its capacity,,&apos;   In lead the consumption of sheet and pipe for all purposes was disappointing, and lead for building trade purposes was not in good demand.    On the other hand,  the cable trade was excellent.Attention might be called to an interesting side-light on the value of the ratification of some agreements by Continental countries.    The consumption of white lead was entirely prohibited in certain Continental countries., yet in one or two of them the actual consumption of white lead had risen considerably since it was totally prohibited.    With regard to spelter, the galvanisers reported lack of orders and they were very slack.   Trade was moderate in other directions.ENGINEERING.SIR ERNEST FETTER said that in this industry the month of April had been disappointing and seemed to give cenfirma-tion to the reports that there was a slight slackening off of enquiries and orders, and that- orders which were being obtained were at more or less unremunerative prices.   The imports of machinery during April amounted to 10,146 tons as against 8,557 tons in March, while exports were 42,644 tons as against 45,885 tons in March.   The cumulative total of exports for the four months of the year were now 184,707 tons as against 188,940 tons in the corresponding period of last year.   That represented a reduction of about 2 per cent.    On the other hand, the average value per ton of imports declined from  168.8 in March to  155*5 in April, and the average vadue of exports rose from  90.5 to  97.4 per ton.Unemployment in general engineering remained unchanged at 9.1 per cent.   That was not uniform over the whole of engineering, and that figure had been maintained largely by a marked improvement in marine engineering employment.As he had said, the reports from most districts appeared to indicate a slackening of enquiries and orders at the present time.   There were seasonable improvements, particular-ly in motors and aircraft and similar work, but, generally speaking, the indications were not so gjod as they had been earlier in the year.MR RICHMOND observed that in Scotland general engineering was only moderately active.   Constructional
lloENGINEERING- (CONTD . ) .works and locomotive shops were somewhat better employed, hov/ever, and machine-tool makers were also experiencing a better demand, especially for the lighter class of work.MR. BROWNLIE gave the following figures   of unemploy-ment amongst members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. In January, 1928, the number unemployed was 13,102 and the percentage 6.37;    in November, 1928, the figures were 15,565 and 7.48$; in December, 1928, 15,633 and 7,56$; in January, 1929, 13,529 aad 6.57$; in March, 11,130 and 5.38$; and in May, 10,793 and 5.18$,    He was informed that there was a scarcity of patternmakers, as well as a scarcity of labour in the ironfounding industry.   Speaking generally, he had reason to believe that the engineering industry was in a favourable state.He read from two letters which he had received from the German Metal Workers&apos; Union,   The first letter, dated- 4th March, 1929, was as follows&quot;Our Kiel District Office have asked us for information re the following matter:   The Deutsche Works is the greatest Kiel Industry,    It was formed after the revolution owing to the pressure of the work-people in the former Royal Dockyard, and in spite of attempts to obtain private capital for it, is still today 100 per cent. Government property.    A.fter the war it had to look for a different class of work, and succeeded excellently in its efforts.    For a consider-able time it worked with better results than in private industry.    Consequently it drew to itself the enmity of private capital (including the  shipowners) which boycotted the yard of the Deutsche Works, Reparations work does not affect Kiel, as it goes mostly to Hamburg or Bremen.   As a result of this, the Deutsche Works must seek work from abroad.    In this It has experienced the greatest difficulty on account of price.    In the last weeks the Deutsche Works have quoted for the construction of two new freight ships of 10,000 tons, and whereas the price quoted by the Deutsche Works has been  243,000 to  256,000 per   ship, the English quotation was  192,000 to  220,000; while Scandinavian yards have quoted  174,000.    As the Deutsche Works have the best equipment of any yard, our Works Council and our members are at a loss to understand such low prices, as the wages in England and also in Scandinavia, are not less than the German wages.&quot;The letter then proceeded to  ask for information as to conditions in the English shipbuilding industry in the matter of the relationship of social burdens and taxes and rates to the sum of the wages, and as to whether there was any State subvention.     Mr. Brownlie had sent considerable information-a-
CONFIDENT! A.L.ENGINEERING (CONTD.)dealing with all the points raised, and had received the follow-ing reply, dated 16th April:&quot;The wages Agreement of 1925 has, besides in wages and working hours, brought about many improvements.    For example the working hours are at present limited by the agreement to 50 hours per week; from 1st November, 1929, the working hours are 49 per week; and after the expiry of the agreement on the 30th June, 1930, the 48 hours week will be strongly advocated.    The minimum wages per agreement are at present, skilled 92 pf.  (lid), semi-skilled 85 pf.  (lOd), unskilled 76 pf.  (9d).    Yteges workers in the shipyards have also an additional amount of 14 pf, (l-ld) per hour, and piece-workers earn above the wage rate in some districts 22 per cent and in other districts up to 40 per cent additional.&quot;MR.BROWNLIS observed that the labour conditions in respect to hours, wages and general workshop conditions were not as favourable in Germany as in this country.      In Germany overtime was paid time and a quarter, and, at the highest, time and a third.    Piecework earnings were fixed at 90 per cent of the day -worker&apos;s rate of wages.    In this country the working hours were 47, and overtime conditions were time and a half until midnight with double-time afterwards, and time and a third for night shift.    Piecework prices, according to the agreement with the engineering employers, were fixed to enable a workman of average ability to earn at least 33Vs    per cent, over his time rate of wages.    Speaking generally, he was justified in saying that the piecework wages were 30 per cent above the daily rate of wages, and they sometimes reached 50, 60 and 75 per cent. The German mental workers were sending a deputation to this country, and it would be coming here in about the month of August.    He was making the necessary arrangements for their reception and to provide them with what information is possibleSIR ERNEST PETTER asked if Mr.  Erownlie had similar information with regard to conditions in the United States. His reason for asking was that, in connection with a large South American contract which had been lost a few months ago, an emissary was sent to the United States to look into the question. He reported that the conditions of labour were not nearly so good In this particular branch of engineering as they were hers, and at the particular works concerned they were working a 54 hour week, and the overtime arrangements were very unfavourable compared with those in this country.     The point was a very important one, particularly in South America where American export credit was Increasing very much and mostly affecting our engineering industry.MR. BROWNLIE replied that his Information with regard to the United States was that the working hours were from 48 to 56, and 60 hours was not unknown.    He understood there were no uniform over-time conditions.    In some establishments they paid time and a half,  In others time and a quarter, and some-times the overtime conditions were even less favourable than that.      But the rates of wages, compared with those in this country, were very deceiving unless the standard of living was taken Into account.     His own conclusion, after two visits to the United States, was that the difference in the rates of wages of skilled workpeople in the two countries was not so
An9ENGINEERING  (CONTD.).ire at as appeared on the surface. /&quot;&quot;See also the section Hours of Labour&quot;./MARINE ENGINEERING.MR RICHMOND observed that during the past month there had been an almost complete absence of orders.   The engineering shops, however, were well employed at the moment on existing work, and this should continue for the next month or two; but the Increase in the price of steel and the possibility of an Increase In the cost of labour were factors which appeared to be operating against the placing of new orders.On the Clyde, during May, 38 vessels of 46,440 tons were launched, which made up a total of 88 vessels of 236,825tcsisf or the first five months of the year.   That was a good average for the period, and would be satisfactory if it could be continued, but the falling away in&apos;new contracts made the outlook for the latter part of the year somewhat uncertain. On the north east coast the position was rather better, and there was a distinct decrease in the unemployment figures for the district.   Recent developments in the whaling industry were continuing to provide work - both in new vessels and conversions and the repair departments were reporting fair activity. Serious complaint, however, was still being made as to low prices and unremunerative contracts.   Employment in the Industry had improved all over since&quot; March, especially on the north east coast and in Scotland; but, although the work in hand should enable the percentage of 10.4 to be maintained for a few months, the outlook thereafter was rather uncertain.The engineering wages question was again.    emerging.    It might be recalled that in April of last year, In response to an application for a national advance of 8s, per week,  the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation had Intimated that they could see no reason why any Increase should be granted at that time. It is   understood that the Unions would be at liberty to renew their application   whenever they considered a sufficient altera tion in conditions had taken place.    On the 9th J.;ay last the Engineering Joint Trades Movement renewed their application and a special conference to consider it would be-held on Wednesday of the next week.
191 X d jlELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR HUGO HIRST conaidered that the industry was doing quite well, though not uniformly so throughout the country. An advance, as compared with last year, of about 10 per cent, had been made in the southern part of the United Kingdom, where new industries were being started and where the influence of good trade and profits from finance showed results over the community in general quicker than in the rest of the country.In the northern part of the United Kingdom the electrical industry was just a reflection of the state of the coal, iron, shipbuilding or woollen industry in the particular district; but, on the whole, we were at least 5 per cent to 6 per cent ahead of last year, so far as hone business was concerned. This applied rather to the lighter side of electrical engineering.    The heavy side of engineering received a set back when the Electricity Act was conceived.    There was an uncertainty as to what might happen and that part of the trade had done badly for the last few years.    Since the Act had come into foroe, however, there had been more enterprise, but rather a change had taken place in the work.    Sir Ernest Petter had saiu that heavy engineering was backward.    On account of the grid there had been more demand for overhead lines, switchgears and transformers, and new works had had to be built. Nevertheless it was true that heavy engineering, though better than it had been, was still somewhat backward.    The new stations were not ready to be put up.    Electricity was going ahead, but some firms in the trade were actually suffering, while others were progressing, through the changes .vhich the grid was bringing about.Some stations had been able to reduce their selling price per unit, and wherever the price dropped one could notice a greater demand for ordinary electrical supplies.    That was of great value to the country, because all those appliances affected not only the electrical industry but almost every other industry.    Sir Hugo was very hopeful that the  /hole country would benefit as the price of electricity dropped more. We had only spent  3,000,000 out of a total of  30,000,000 on the gria, and that  8,000,000 had not shown definite results yet.    It might take another year before any definite result would be seen.As regards foreign business, we.were losing In the South American market the hold that the electrical industry had formerly had.    This was largely due to the acquisition of telephone companies and utility companies by Americans. For instance, one large company used to place in this country orders to the extent of nearly  500,000 a year.    Those orders had gone from this country through the acquisition of the undertaking by an American group of financiers.   The utility companies where our material could be used, were now forbidden to buy from England, because the owners vere American.    The loss in South America and to some extent in China, where the Americans had put up factories, had not been made good by the growing business inside the Dominions.    The only great progress which had been made was in the Crown Colonies, and he -ras afraid it was not always appreciated what a big market was waiting for us in the Crown Colonies.    He would like to put that to the members of this Council.
199*Ny i-^MOTOR INDUSTRY.SIR OYRIL HURGOMB recalled that at some previous meetings of the Council he had given figures as regards the number of motor-cars and motor-bicycles registered for the first time.    He had now the figures for April, which 3howed an increase, as compared with April, 1928, of 2,377 vehicles, excluding motor-cycles, and an increase in the number  &quot;of motor-cycles of just under 1,000.    A good many statements had appeared in the Press to the effect that the demand for motor vehicles   ,had fallen off, but these figures proved that the number of new vehicles registered was distinctly higher than in the corresponding month for last year.    The total number of vehicles, excluding motor-cycles, registered for the first time in April was 32,600, whilst the number of motor-cycles was -just under 12,000.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS wrote:-&quot;According to information whioh I have received since the last meeting of the Advisory Council, I regret to have to report that the motor industry has experienced a gradual fall in orders received and this has, presumably, been due to the election atmosphere.    The decline has continued since the result of the election became known, but it is hoped that an improvement will be shown when the political position has become   stabilised&quot;.COTTON.SIR KENNETH STEWART observed that his reports dealt with the merchant side of the cotton trade.    The exports for the first four months of this year were almost exactly similar to those of 1937 and 1928.    He had not the totals for May yet; but, if anything there was a very slight rise in the total yardage exported.    On the other hand, so far as orders in hand and in prospect vere concerned, things were pretty bad just now for most markets.India, which was our largest market, shoved very small signs of activity indeed, and the jute manufacturers, who did a very large trade with India, were hard up for work. Then an embargo had been placed on fresh orders by the Calcutta dealers for September shipment, and it did not look as if Are  /ere going to get many fresh orders from India for a month or two.    In Karachi, which was a rising and very good market, the mill,trouble in Bombay and the trouble in Afghanistan were having a rather depressing effect on imports.    The mill trouble was causing a good deal of financial difficulty among the dealers and many failures had been reported.In China, which was another very important market, the first half of May saw a fair trade doing for Shanghai, especially in fancies, - that is to say, a fair trade as counted nowadays, but our China trade had gone down very much.    A big drop in silver had occurred about the beginning
COTTON (CONTD.).of the month, and as the buying in China was still in silver, that had a serious effect on fresh orders coming in. On the other hand, the latest reports from China during this month showed a rather better tone in the market, so that one had some hope that it might possibly improve.In South America trade had been very quiet for some time past, but    there was a tendency for buyers there to revert from Italian and other Continental makers back to British makers because of many rather unsatisfactory experiences, and the prospects for the future there appeared to be rather better.In the trade at home and in the Empire there had been a fair demand, especially for artificial silks in fancy makes. That had fallen off and the demand appeared now to be satisfied, and makers were seeking orders at home.    There was a general feeling of depression.    Orders appeared to be falling off on every side, and makers were finding their looms running out almost everywhere.MR. HER3ERT LEE had nothing good to report, from the point of view of the producer.    Extreme quietness in the market continued and had even become accentuated.    There were not nearly sufficient orders coming in to keep the spindles and the looms of the country running at anything like full time, and the prospect of orders at the moment appeared to be very bad.    In the fine section the short time which had been running for three months had been called off, but he thought that in fact a considerable amount of short time was being worked, and even where full.time was running it was by strong firms who were able to face the accumulation of a certain amount of stock.    The whole aspect of the trade at the moment could hardly be worse.As to the demand, or the suggested demand, for a reduction in wages, that had to follow a very long course. Each district had its own Association, and those Associations were combined in the General   Federation of Master Cotton Spinners.    A suggestion had been sent in to the General Federation from about three districts that a reduction in wages should be demanded.      The only action that the Federation had taken up to the present time was to send on that suggestion to the other Associations which composed the Federation, to get their views. &apos; If the Associations united in considering that a demand should be made for a reduction in -wages, then naturally an interview with the representatives of the employees would be asked for and the whole thing discussed with them.SIR K. STEWART remarked that although the reports on cotton and cotton goods this month were depressing, he did not think that other countries could be said to be in a much better position than this country.    The depression in cotton goods seemed to be almost universal.
CQTTON. i001JTJ51) .MR.LENNOX LEE stated that the American crop news had on the whole been favourable, New low price levels had been reached, but no violent fluctuations had occurred.-    In the Egyptian section spot cotton had fluctuated more violentlyThe event of the month of May had been the arrangement made for a new combine   in the fine spinning trade covering: fifteen companies owning thirty-one mills, with about three million spindles and a production capacity of 50,000,000 lbs. per annum,    The bleaching trade had passed through a quiet period, and bookings had shown no definite upward movement-Compared with tho corresponding month last year,  they were slightly down.    In the dyeing section experience had been varied.    Certain lines had shown increases, but -the experience of many firms was that May had been one of the poorest months for soae time.    In the print trado there had been a slight improvement, but the plant capacity was still barely 60 per cent,  employed and business was from hand to mouth.ilQOL.MR.ARTHUR SHAW observed that the wool textile trade found itself in a most difficult position.    He thought there were three reasons for that.    The first reason was the delay in publishing the report of the Safeguarding Inquiry.    That matter,  in his opinion,  ought to be dealt with Immediately. It was in the interests of&quot;the industry that the report should be issued and a decision taken.    There was no doubt that a considerable amount of stuff had been dumped in this country, and the general opinion was that this was preparatory for the autumn trade.The second reason was that unfortunately there was no general wage agreement covering the industry.    Owing to that fact a large number of the employers in the various sections of the trade had deemed it necessary to post notices for a reduction.    In the absence of an agreement the trade unions were strenuously resisting the proposals of the employers to make individual efforts to reduce wages, and unfortunate disputes had taken place.      Within    the last month about twenty or thirty firms had been in dispute,  and about sixteen of them had recommenced work under the old conditions.    Where vie had the machinery of an Industrial Council,  common sense ought to prevail and the Council should deal with the situation.The third reason,  in his view, was to be found in the rapid changes in the prices of raw material, which very materially affected trading conditions.    If prices were very uncertain,  manufacturers and others were not prepared to enter into business.    At the present time wooi prices had been falling, and had reached the lowest point since 1922, particularly in the better qualities.    For instance, 64 tops and yarns touched last month the lowest price since 1928.
I M JWOOL  (OONTD.)Merino tops at the commencement of 1928 sold at 55 d, per lb. and today they could be bought at 41d., a reduction since January, 1928, of approximately 25 per cent.    This fluctuation had gone ^on sinco the war period;    and just for the purpose of securing-a reoord on the minutes, he would give the following figures talcing the average price of wool tops and yarns in 1914 at 100, the highest post-war average price had been 450 and the lowest 112.    In December 1924, the figure was 229,  in January 1928, it was 1S6.    Since 1928 there had been a continuous fall In the price every month, and the value of wool in May of this year reached the lowest point, i.e., 133 as against 100 pre-war.   He submitted that these three oauses were very material to the position of the industry.General trading conditions had been fairly maintained.    In the heavy woollen districts unemployment had been gradually reduOed during the past month.    This applied particularly to Batley and Dewsbury, where in previous reports the percentage of unemployed had been reported as 53 per cent, and where it was now down to about 15 per cent.    The Yeadon district, on the other hand, had not maintained the improvement shown in March and April, and a number of firms were working short time there. In the Huddersfield district the fine quality trade was in a very good condition, but the heavy woollen trade was not satisfactory.    In the Bradford trade (dress goods)there had been a considerable revival in April and short time was materially reduced.    Spinners were working almost full time, and the weaving section had improved.His final word would be that unless what he called the fundamentals were tackled in the woollen textile industry,there did not seem to be any hope of a general improvement, or a general revival in the industry.SIR FREDERIC AYKROYD wrote:-&quot;We are now at that period of the year which is known in the textile trade as between seasons.    The only orders which aro placed now are the repeat orclerB, which are fairly numerous in a busy season and very sparse in a poor season.    Owing to our abnormally high costs a season&apos;s business consists of orders mainly got through speculating as only orders for speciality goods are obtained in the open markets after competition with the Gontinent,&quot;Since the May report we have had a General Election whioh naturally has a disturbing influence on business generally. Speculation as to Safeguarding has resulted in&apos; a flood of imports of various types of dress goods,  and these will have to be contended v/ith during the remainder of the year.    It is understood that the bulk of the cloths are intended for next autumn and winter trade.    Whether they will provo to be the right types from the point of view of fashion remains to bo seen- but in any event the presence of so large a volume of imported material is not healthy for the home trade. -
vYOOL  (CONTD.).&quot;Having regard to the general financial position in Germany and the eerious shortage of liquid capital, it is too much to expect any appreciable expansion of trade in the near future.     Machinery activity is slightly less than last month.    Combing figures show 4$ less running, more particularly in the Merino section; spinning and weaving slightly less. There are exceptions in the case of those manufacturers weaving high class goods for the South American market. Guiseley, Batley and D6wsbury districts are all rather quieter.&quot;Confidence in the Government is needed if business is to be held together.    The industry as a whole is fighting for its existence.      If we are to obtain a share of the Continental orders every effort will have to be made to bring down costs.&quot;May is generally considered the maximum month for employment, whereas August is a minimum, so without repeat orders (which are not likely thio season) we shall decline in activity during the next two months.HOSIERY.-  MR. WALKER sent in the following reports:-&quot;Leicester.    vVhilst there is no great change to report in the general condition of the knitwear trade, the recent spell of warm weather has improved the sale-of summer goods. The ever-increasing popularity of fancy knitted outerwear is keeping manufacturers well employed and there is every prospect of a continuance of this demand, but other sections of the trade are not so favourably situated, and speaking generally, trade in the Leicester district is not so    good as it should be at this time of the year, and not so good as it was twelve months ago.    There is, however, a feeling of confidence amongst manufacturers that business generally is slowly improving, and it is hoped that now the General Election is out of the way, business will gradually Improve.&quot;Nottingham.    The underwear soction Is fairly well employed but the Tiokleness of the weather is militating against real activity in the summer goods trade.    The position of the wool market is also causing buyers to exercise extreme caution in placing advance orders for the autumn.    Generally, there is a feeling of uncertainty which appears to bo responsible for an ab.3onoe of buoyancy in the trade, so necessary to continuity of employment.    Silk and tho better qualities of artificial Bilk hose are in good demand, as well as fancy half hose.&quot;Loughborough.    Conditions are similar to those in Nottingham, trade generally being olack, - very similar to last month but definitely worse than the previous year.    Short time is being worked in underwear.    Pure silk and art.  silk are much better than cotton and all-wool hosiery.
1 ?7CONFIDENT IAL. HOSIERY  (.contd..),&quot;Mansfield.    The seamless trade in this district is very -poor, In cashmeres, cottons, artificial silk and pure silk and fancies.    In the fashioned trade all qualities are fairly good, hut somewhat upset by the Election.    The fashioned fancy trade is still very good.&quot;CHEMICALS.MR. HILL reported that the trade in chemicals in the past month, both in the fine and the heavy sections, had remained practically unchanged.   The anticipated improvement in demand for chemicals for the artificial silk industry had so far failed to materialise.   There was, however, a definitely hope-ful outlook for chemicals in that section.   The only other feature was the demand for fertilisers, which had been good.The Association of British Chemical Manufacturers some time ago took a step which was believed to be novel.   They set up a Works Technical Committee which had been given the task of drawing up a set of model safety rules for use in chemical works.   Part I had already been issued in a provisional form, and set forth the principles which should be applied in the erection and operation of chemical plant with a view to preventing accident and safeguarding the workers.   Part II would consist of a more extended explanation of the object to be obtained by the rules.   The rules covered a wider field than the Chemical Works Regulations of 192S, and dealt with all chemical manufacture except explosives.   The Home Office had been collaborating with the industry,  so that the cumulative experience both of the industry and of the Government Depart-ment concerned would be available to every manufacturer.RUBBER.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL observed that trade was maintained in respect of sports goods and surgical goods.   The garment section of the trade was very bad Indeed,  entirely owing to the cold, dry Spring having practically killed the business of the season.   The accumulations of stocks were such that the.price would inevitably lead to an unfavourable result, to the garment manufacturer.   There was very keen competition In the cheaper lines of shoes, particularly from the Continent, where they worked long hours and low wages were paid.     Thread for the textile trades was a bright spot in the rubber industry at the moment,  and the home market and the overseas prospects were very good indeed.    Generally, the trade was fairly employed, but not bright.
CONFIDENTIALGENERAL TRADE.SIR WALTER RAINE stated that the ship repairing trade was very busy throughout the country * on the Tyne, the Mersey and the Wear.   The owner of a large dry-dock in Sunderland had told him recently that 11 steamers were booked to go to his dry-dock in the next few weeks;   Of course, some of those jobs would be only 48-hour jobs - painting and so on      neverthe-less it was quite an unusual thing at this time Of the year to have so much ship-repairing.The engineering trade had already been referred to, and one fact came out in several of the reports that he had; namely that in machine building and tool making great difficulty was being experienced in finding a sufficient number of skilled men,   The making.-up trade of Nottingham was also having great difficulty in finding experienced machinists j and it was reported that the girls who lived round about Nottingham were showing great disinclination to learn this trade.    Hence the shortage.In the retail hosiery trade one fact might be mentioned, namely, that in artificial silk and wool the utmost difficulty was found in the matching of colours.    It was considered that the proposed.establishment of a British Colour Council would no doubt have a very welcome effect in overcoming difficulties such as this.The boot and shoe trade was reported to be most satisfactory, and, generally speaking, full time was being worked.Liverpool notified a further fall in the price of bacon. Danish fell, as did Swedish, the latter to the extent of 11s. per cwt, during the past month.    Other ContinentalWilt shires&quot; - the term should be noted - also eased off in price.   The Liverpool tanning trade was dull, and would feel the effect of the higher American tariff duties if they were put on.   The duties talked of were 10 per cent on hides, 22-g to 30 per cent, leather, and 20 per cent, on boots.Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR. HAYKURST wrote to the following&apos; effect the business of my Society during the past month has been of the usual character.    Our various sections report that the volume of business has been well maintained, and the bulk orders received compare very satisfactorily with thecorresw ponding period of last year.     The production of goods in our different works and factories has been up to the usual standard, and the general tone all round is one of optimism.Grocery and Provisions.    After supplies for Whitsuntide requests &quot;had been&quot;met&quot;, a much quieter tone prevailed.   The production of Danish butter, now that the cattle are grass-fed,-IS-
GENERAL TRADE  (CONTD.).!3p -operati-ye V/wholesale Society (Cgntd.) .is very heavy, and this will probably result in a strong demand by speculators for storage purposes at higher prices.    Irish creamery and blended butters are moving well.    Since the holidays the sugar market has ruled quiet;   during the latter part of May prices of refined fell 3d. per cwt.Tea,  etc. Since the last report there has been an easier tendency in the home market, more especially In common and medium kinds, due chiefly to a drop in quality. The offerings of Indian tea are nearing the end of the season, and stalk is getting prevalent.    For some time the quality of the Ceylon tea has been falling, and at the time of this roport it is the worst that has been on sale for some months.    During the last four weeks the coffee auctions have been partially suspended for the holidays, but large supplies have been auctioned. There is nothing to report about the conditions of the cocoa market, because this is only the mid-season in West Africa and the bean which comes from this middle crop is not of much quality.RETAIL TRADE.SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE reported that retail trade during May had had a number of adverse influences to contend with.    At the beginning of the month tho weather had been far from favourable, while at the end, when an improvement in weather gave hopes of better trade, the Election undoubtedly exerted an unsettling influence.    Speaking generally,  therefore, almost all firms had reported that they found business unsatisfactory in the first two weeks of tho month, and tho expectations for a good pre-Whitsuntide trade were not fulfilled until immediately before the holiday.    This improvement continued for some little time after the break, but owing to tho Election the month ended poorly.    The net result, when reflected in figures, was that most stores throughout tho country had difficulty in maintaining last year&apos;s salos. Individual departments had in some cases done well, and individual stores had been able to overcome the unsettling factors, but these good results could be accounted for by peculiar circumstances,  such as special advertising campaigns or advantages accruing this year from reconstructions which were not common to the rest of the trade.It was much more difficult this month to detect any decided tendencies. Taking the West End stores first, the boot and shoe departments were still finding conditions difficult, and, probably owing to the continued dry weather, sales were on an average 5 per cent, down on the month. It had also been a poor month for furniture in the West End; and, in spite of one or two small increases, an average fall of some 7 per cent, was reported.    In women&apos;s wear there were very small variations averaging a reduction of about 8 per cent, although piece goods showed, on the whole,  a small but encouraging improvement.
1 30x o uRETAIL TRADE (CQKTD.).In Outer London no decided tendencies were to be observed, and the trade experience had been not dissimilar to that of the West End stores.    The men&apos;s wear and hardwear departments showed some substantial increases, and shoes had enjoyed a slightly better bale, but trade in the furniture departments was still disappointingly slow.   Business in the departments concerned with women&apos;s wear showed no significant variations.Comparisons for the North of England were made more difficult by the greater importance of the Whitsuntide holiday in some districts, but the general description of trade given above substantially held good, tho better conditions after Whitsun enabling the leeway to be made up.    Contrary to what had occurred in London, however, furniture appeared to have been one&apos;of the successful departments, and an average increase of fully 15 per cent, was reported.     Boots and shoes were down some 7 per cent., and piece goods down some 10 per cent. Women&apos;s wear was about level, and men&apos;s wear 15 per cent. down. Unemployment and consequent loss of purchasing power was still being severely felt in some areas.In the South, and in Wales, better sales of women&apos;s wear had been reported, averaging an increase of fully 10 per cent, and furniture also had sold well, but in the other departments variations in either direction had been of small importance.Throughout the country as a whole, therefore, retail trade during May had been disappointing.FINANCE.SIR GUY GRANET handed in the following:-&quot;Since the report I made at the beginning of April last the financial situation abroad has continued to exercise considerable influence on monetary conditions in this country. Rates as high as 20% and a general average rate of about 10$ were ruling for call money in the American stock market until May 25th, when it was announoed that the Federal Reserve Advisory Council had recommended the Federal Reserve Board to grant permission to various Reserve Banks who had applied for official approval to an increase in their re-discount rates, permiesion for which had previously been refused by the Federal Reserve Board.    The announcement of this decision was immediately followed by a severe set back in the price of leading speculative stocks on the New York stock exchange, and there has also been a noteworthy reduction in B^ederal Reserve credit (brokers&apos; call loans) which has been more or less maintained.    This factor, together with the break in the price of wheat and the appearance of a less optimistic feeling regarding the outlook for general business conditions, is expected to assist the deflationary movement towards more normal conditions.    During my reoent visit to the United States I was very much impressed by the enormous amount of
FINANCE (contd..).&quot;domestic-&quot; or purely American money available for call loans to the New York stook exohange, and I understand that although a large amount of funds of foreign origin are still employed in that market, by far the greater portion is American money.&quot;Another disturbing element has been the unsettled state of affairs in Germany in connection with the Paris reparations discussions.     The uncertainty which prevailed for some weeks regarding the outcome of this conference has been responsible for severe restriction of credit in Germany caused mainly by the withdrawal or non-renewal of maturing short term loans, whioh up to a few months ago flowed to Germany from New York, Paris, and other centres.     To some extent London may have benefited by a temporary transfer of euch loans from   marks into sterling, but not in such volume as to make much impression on the market here.The market whioh has the major influenoe on London is undoubtedly New York, and it is highly significant that during the week ending June 1st, when the conditions detailed above arose, the discount rate here immediately rose to 5?A6$, but eased towards the end of the week to 55/l3$, when it beoame known that, despite the recommendation of the Advisory Council, the Federal Reserve Board would not be asked to sanction an increase of rate at present.   The London discount rate has remained about this figure from that time, a rate whioh may be considered about the normal open market rate for the present Bank of England rate of 5j?fo to be effective.&quot;Although the Bank of England has been obliged to pay above its minimum price, it has succeeded in securing a good proportion of the gold in the open market.    It Is hoped that the pressure from abroad will not be such that gold shipments will necessitate a rise in our bank rate. Incidentally, the shipment recently of about  259,000 gold from the Bank of England to New York was the first that had been made since the Bank raised its rate in February last in order to correct a similar movement,&quot;Apart from the factors mentioned above, the situation has from a commercial banking point of vie;v been - fairly good, and the facilities of London accepting houses have continued to be well used.    In fact, one result of the instability of the New York market has been to ,increase the demand for London acceptances and the volume of genuine commercial business is back to pre-war levels.   Provided stable conditions are maintained here there is every reason to hope that it -will remain, ae international traders have discovered that London is the sole possessor of an independent discount market and that its central banking system is the best in the World.&quot;The Federal Reserve Banks have been the principal source of American re-discount and the American system of using the stock exchanges as their principal market for placing call loans has prevented the formation of an adequate independent discount market.    Consequently, when
CONFIDENTIAL.1 99X &apos;V UjFINANCE (CONTDp)the Federal Reserve re-discount resources reached saturation point &quot;business in the open market became difficult, if not almost impossible, and the rate rose above the official rate.    It was therefore necessary for international business to seek a centre with real discount facilities, and London with its unique organisation was the only alternative&quot;.    /Sir Guy Granefs verbal repoft at the meeting is given in the section on United States trade/.SHIPPING,MR.

There had been an increase of  310,000 in the receipts from coal and of about  150,000 from other merchandise; but passenger traffic continued to show a rather heavy decline in receipts, and there was a reduction as compared with the same period last year of over  250,000 under that head.The figures for the 22 weeks of the year ended 2nd June were interesting.    They showed a reduction in passenger receipts of about  1,250,000, and an increase in coal receipts of nearly  1,500,000; but, as the receipts from merchandise other than coal were  700,000 less, the net result was that the railway receipts for all traffics during the 23 weeks were nearly  500,000 below those for the corresponding period of last year.SIR J0SIAH STAMP sent the following figures:-Twenty-two weeks ended 2nd June, 1929., i   Increase 19291929.     i  1928.   !    compared withi 1928.Decrease 1929 compared -with 1928-.!           .  .i(Thousands) !

134-a. O fj;EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS said that the unemployment figures during May were definitely better than In April, and in that respect differed markedly from those of last year, when the figures took a definite turn for the worse in May.    On May 13th the total for the first time this year was lower than that for the corresponding date last year.    The figure for June 3rd, which v/as just over 1,100,000, was the lowest recorded this year.Having regard to the experience of the past few years, it was hardly to be expected that the total of registered unemployment would not show an upward tendency from now until the late autumn, but up to the present the trend had been distinctly better than it was last year.Monthly Statistics of insured persons aged 16 to 6* in employment.Estimated number &quot;in employment after deduct-ing from Col.4 3^ per cent,  of the numbers in Col. 2 to allow for sicknessK snd other unrecorded non-employment, exclusive of temporary holidaysDate,(1)Estimated number insured.Number un-employed.(2)(3)Difference! between Columns 2 &amp; 3 (to nearest hundred).Includingpersons directly involved in trade disputes(5)Excludingpersons directly involved In trade disputes.

TRAPS IN CANADA.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR observed that from a business point of view his visit to America had been very unsatisfactory. He had simply closed down. With Canada it was quite different. The moment one crossed into Canada one found a different state of affairs.    He had been going there for 44 years, and had never seen Canada so really prosperous and so really producing as at present.    From Winnipeg to Montreal he had visited most of the large factories, the big steel works included, and had never seen so much production going on in Canada before. Not only so, but the railways were expanding, - lengthening and improving their lines, putting down heavier rails, and building heavier locomotives which were produced in Canada, and particularly in Montreal.Of course, the prosperity of Canada was based on the railways and on agriculture.    The trade that they could get from agriculture really controlled the situation, and the moment the railways began to economise the whole country suffered.    The amount of agricultural machinery being produced in Canada for Canada was quite extraordinary. The manufacturers were working night and day and could not produce machinery rapidly enough. It was all for internal consumption.    On the -mining side large developments were going on north of Winnipeg, almost entirely with American money, he was sorry to say.    It looked, however, as though some very big mining fields would produce great wealth north of Winnipeg which would^help to stabilise employment in the country.He had been much impressed with the steel works. Makers were putting up completely modem plants for blast furnaces, rolling-mills and Siemen&apos;s mills, and he had also been immensely struck by the fact that even small works were employing scientific methods and calling to their aid every kind of chemical research which was available. That sort of aid was being aoplied a great deal more than in this country.As regards our selling organisations in Canada,Sir A.balfour thought we were very deficient. V/e did not seem to send over people who knew enough about their business to compete with the very highly trained Americans who could slip across the border overnight.    The Americans sent experts to Canada to show them their boring mills, with full drawings of all their machinery. There was a tremendous field for machinery in Canada to-day if the right kind of highly-trained people were sent over to sell it.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG wrote to the following effect:-The bales of wool received into store from 1st July to 50th April last were 2,580,836;    those sold, 2,422,019; those shipped for sale overseas, 25,620.    The final Sydney sales were held on 8th May, the turnover for the season commencing last August being a record.
i. ss- confidential.AU STRALIAN TRADE(CO NTD.)Dairying production is declining or stationary in all States except Western Australia, where prospects for increased production in the coming season are good.   Exports of wheat this season amounted to 66,679,812 bushels compared with 33,570,780 bushels last season.      Flour exports this season were 285,556 tons as compared with 203,936 tons last year. About half the wheat and flour exported this season has been sold to the East and India.The appointment of committees representing shipping, exporting and importing Interests in each State, as recommended by the overseas shipping conference,  Is now practically complete.     The first meeting of the central committee is to be held on 25th June.     The conference of State Premiers with the Commonwealth Prime Minister held during May arrived at the following decisions among others:-    (a) The States under-took to consider the creation In each State of an authority to control electrical power development within the State with the ultimate object of co-ordinating and standardising the electrical development of various units of the Commonwealth, and (b) the conference approved the establishment of a Federal transport council as a consultative advisory body, and of an authority in each State to co-ordinate transport in that State.A Commonwealth loan of  12,403,734 has been underwritten converting the Queensland 5-g- per cent, stock maturing 1st July into Commonwealth 5 per cent, at 97 maturing 1945 and 197 5. The bank clearances in all capitals from 1st January to 27th May last amounted to  987,793,000 as compared with  941,433,000 in the corresponding period last year.    The trade exports for nine months ended March last were  115,571,946, compared with  115,220,360 for the same period in last year, and the imports  108,378,034 compared  with  116,303,036 for last year,    The Empire shopping week held In all the capitals had satisfactory results.INDIAN TRADE.MR. GREEN reported that, during the year ending 31st March, 1929, Imports of merchandise had risen by 1,2 per cent and exports by 2,8 per cent.      The visible balance of trade was  59,000,000 in favour of India, or an Increase of over  1,750,000,      A noticeable feature was the heavy import of wheat largely the result of a poor crop in India and low world prices.    But it must be remembered that, despite this, and despite reduced shipments and lower prices of rice, India re-remained a great exporter of grain, pulse and flour, the net exports being valued at  17,250,000.     As regards exports,  the raw cotton trade had largely recovered from the slump of the previous year, and the total raw cotton exports were valued at  40,000,000 sterling.The share of the United Kingdom in India1s trade was still declining. Before the war the United Kingdom supplied over 60$ of Indians imports and took 25$ of her exports.    In the year
INDIAN TRADE  (CONTD.).under review the United Kingdom supplied 44.7$ of the Imports, and took 21.18$ of the exports.x    The new fiscal year had opened well, imports of merchandise in April last being nearly  2,000,000 higher than in April, 1928, and exports being  1,750,000 higher,    There was a net import of gold and silver of  2,000,000 and a visible balance of trade of over  750,000 in favour of India.    Imports of cotton piece-goods were well above the figures for April, 1928, and exports of raw ootton were better by  700,000.On 6th June the Imperial Bank of India rate was reduced to 5 per cent.   At this time last year the rate was 7 per cent, and it did not fall to 5 per cent, until 19th July.    A rupee loan limited to  20,250,000 was shortly to be issued.    In view of the present state of the international money market, the nominal rate of interest offered had been raised, but the currencies of the loan were comparatively short.The latest news of the monsoon received that day by cable, showed that by 10th   June the monsoon was normally active along the west coast and in the central parts of the country. It might be said, therefore,  that the monsoon had started well.SOUTH AMERICAN TBADE.MR. HOSE wrote;-&quot;Weather conditions in Argentina during the past month have been somewhat unfavourable for agricultural operations, there having been insufficient rain to facilitate ploughing, while sowing of wheat has also been retarded.    In fact, it is considered probable that the total area sown to wheat for the next harvest will show an appreciable diminution.    On the other hand, the dry weather has facilitated the movement of maize, large quantities from the new crop having come forward for shipment.     The economic position of Argentina has been rendered slightly less favourable by reason of the recent decline in world prices of wheat, and by the lowering of values of other of the country&apos;s principal export products. The effect,  so far,has not been serious, having been confined chiefly to a tightening of the monetary situation, which was characterised a few months ago by a somewhat excessive supply of funds.&quot;The decline in the Uruguayan exohange within recent weeks has been the subject of considerable comment, although a partial recovery has latterly taken place, the current quotation of 47ifd. per peso comparing with the parity of 51d.    In this connection I would mention that there Is no evidence that the decline has resulted from any fundamental change in Uruguayan conditions the movement may be attributed partly to the hardening of money rates in Argentina, which has naturally tended to attract funds from Uruguay,  while, at the same time,  the Uruguayan exchange may be considered as in a sense linked with that of Argentina: so that, although not based upon a fully operative&quot;gold standard, the value of the currency has been similarly affected by the decline in prices of the oountry&apos;s export commodities.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD.)&quot;The general economic situation in Chile continued satisfactory during April, and the outlook appears promising. Extensive constructional activity, good crops, and a satisfac-tory demand for copper, contributed to an increase in merchandise sales, a movement which was reflected in greater activity in the import markets and domestic manufacturing industries.   Monetary conditions, however, showed a further tightening, and discount rates for commercial paper advanced slightly.&quot; The Treaty arranged with Peru for the settlement of the long-standing dispute regarding the sovereignty of the Tacna and Arica Provinces has now been signed in Lima.    This augurs well for the friendly interchange of trade between the two Republics, apart from its effect in relieving the political tension in this section of South American affairs.    An important and early result should be the release of an Increased number of Peruvian nationals for work in the nitrate^ fields.    In furtherance of their efforts to foster the market for Chilean nitrate of soda, the Producers1 Association is offering to dealers and ethers the benefits of a scheme of price protection in respect to any stocks remaining unsolcLron 30th June,  1929.&quot;The chief difficulty in brazil jl continues to be the necessity of financing the coffee crop;    this appears to be deflecting funds from other commercial activities in \he country and enhancing the credit stringency, which,  in the capital city of Rio de Janeiro, is still severe.    The chief need for the future definite establishment of Brazil upon a sound economic basis will be the greater diversification of. her export products; in the case of meat, especially, Brazil might take a more prominent part in world trade.    Such developments, however, can take place only when capital is freely available both for-trade and transport, and this can hardly precede the legal stabilisation of exchange, which is still deferred.&quot;The picking of the cottcn crop in Peru has commenced in certain of the valleys, and it is reported that the staple is of good quality.    It is confidently expected that the crop-will be much larger than that of last year.    The production of Peruvian sugar is also expected to show a slight increase, and the canes appear to be in good condition.    It is reported, how-ever, that in some areas the growers propose to grind all the available canes this year, and turn their ground over to cotton in 1930.    Provisional official returns have been published of Peruvian foreign trade for the year 1928, and these show that a small increase in the value of exports was accompanied by an appreciable decline in imports, so that the export surplus of merchandise trade showed an increase of some  P2,500,000.    In the Import trade of Peru during 1928, the United States took first place, supplying about 42 per cent, of the total value of imports, followed by Great Britain with 16 per cent., and then by Germany with-&quot;10 per cent.    The United States was also the principal purchaser of Peruvian export products, taking 28 per cent, of the total value, Great Britain being second with 24 per cent., Argentina third with 10 per cent,, and Germany fourth with 9 per cent,&quot;it appears that the recent release by the Government of Colombia 0f a number of employees will enable a larger propor-tion of the coffee.crops to be gathered than had bean anticipated, so that the supply of the commodity for export will be correspondingly increased.     The general commercial situation in .Colombia is dull.    In Guatemala shipments of coffee have been taking place normally, but business in general has been rather dull.   A somewhat exceptional situation has arisen in the looalCONFIDENTIAL.

Commercial activities in leneSela w^a   ^y interrupted during the earlier part of last montg^v the Presidential elections&quot;, xoonon oy tneUNITED STATES TRADE,SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR, referring to a recent visit of his to the United States, said that the trade of Sheffield with that country in high-speed steel was practically dead.   Not onl only was it not possible for Sheffield makers to compete in price, but it was impossible to compete in service.    One would have to have suoh large stocks over there, and to pay suoh enormous duties on them, that there was no practical possibility of trading.   Therefore all that Sheffield makers felt that they could do now in the United States was to send cvor a few specialities and get the best price they could for them.    The Sheffield firms had closed their own businesses gver there and had appointed agents.   Regarding hollow drill steel, the United States had put on suoh a high tariff that 1^hey had killed that trade entirely, but this was perhaps aimed more at Sweden than at us.    It was done at the special request of the Crucible Steel Company   of America.What had struck him very forcibly in the United States was the tremendous number of people who were employed in the motor-oar industry, directly or indirectly.    He thought it was a fair statement to make that nearly 35 per cent, of the people employed in the United States were, in one way or another, connected with the motor industry.    The clothing trade was prosperous, the textile trade was very depressed indeed., and the heavy machinery trade was even more depressed than in this country.    It was quite an error to think that America was universally prosperous,    A great many people were in distress over there, particularly in the heavy machinery and shipbuilding industries.    There were at least  three million people unemployed in the States at the present time, and Sir Arthur saw more visible unemployment in Detroit, Cleveland and other towns than one ever saw in any town in this country.e always thought that the prosperity of America could not go on, but as long as they were able to obtain from the soil such immense yields of oil and minerals - not to mention the products of agriculture - with the exertions of relatively very few peoplo in relation to the material they producer,, he did not see why America should not go on for many more years with the prosperity she had now.SIR GUY GRANET said that our attention had been fixed, and he thought must continue to be fixed, on New York.    That was going to affect us in this country,  so far as he could see, for a very considerable time to come.     At the moment, the danger, that owing to the activity   of the
UNITED STATES TRADE  (CONTD.)stock market there and the legitimate demands of trade there it would he necessary to advance our discount rates, had disappeared. He called It a danger because of its reaction on this country. There had been a cessation for the moment of speculative activity, but, as he saw it, and he had just come back from America, unless a distinct check-&apos; In trade there took place, the demand for money there was bound to continue.    There was such abundant opportunity to use it, and such a natural tendency to use it speculatively, that he thought the danger of dear money in this country would remain until a break occurred in the trade conditions in America.    But he agreed with Sir Arthur Balfour,&amp; could not see any reason to apprehend any such break.    It seemed to him that America would have a continuation of its abounding prosperity for some time to come.Incidentially, the result of the demand in the United States for money, which was provided so largely by the banks, who were also the discount market, had had the effect of re-establishing to a large extent our acceptance business in London.    The bill drawer had found that London was the only really independent money market in the world, and the result was that the volume of acceptance business had increased very largely and was well up to the pre-war standards.    That was something to the good.    It was due to that, and partly to the way in which the Bank of England, in spite of very great difficulties, had managed affairs,  that a stability of rate had been maintained.HOURS OF LABOUR.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR mentioned that United States engineering shops worked any hours that suited them.    Many of them worked 54 hours, and some of them worked 52 hours a week.    But r.&quot; throughout Canada and the United States there was no question of how many hours they worked.    They would work as many hours as there was work for them to do, without any question. In two or three factories, in Detroit specially, and in Cleveland, Sir Arthur had seen girls working six milling machines each, and prepared to take another one on if it could be fitted in, and men working four lathes constantly.MR.BROWNLIE said he was very pleased to know that there were hopes of bringing about uniformity in the working hours of workmen in this country and in other countries .  He believed it would go a long vray towards establishing better relations in industry to the benefit of all.    They had a 47 hours week in the shipbuilding industry In this country, and he was anxious that that should be safeguarded.    But he was also anxious to bring the foreign nations on to a level with us, so far as overtime and working conditions were concerned, and he was pressing for the ratification of the Washington Convention with a view to bringing that about.
HOURS OF LABOUR  (CONTD.)SIR KUOO HIRST said that a few years ago, when we were pressed to sign the Washington Convention,he made it his business to study the situation.    Hs went to Germany and to France, both of which countries alleged that they agreed with the Washington Convention.    He found that there were many loopholes by way of local regulations under which they could work as many hours as they liked.    On the other hand,  if the British Government or the British workers signed an agreement they would stick to it loyally, and would not resort to any subterfuge.    He hoped, therefore, that we and the Americans would see, when the Convention was ratified, that those &quot;by-passes&apos;1 were made as difficult as possible.MR.  BROWNLIEstated that from his association with the representatives of labour in the metal industries on the Continent, he was convinced that there was a keen and sincere desire on the part of the representatives of the metal industries in all Continental countries in favour of the ratification and strict observance of the Washington Convention.    He hoped they would be able to exercise sufficient pressure in the interests of uniform observance of the agreement as ratified.
