J)*Q.P. 186 (29)Q-A   I,JLli,HOiviE PRODUCED IC&amp;T FOR 1IB HOT IN HOMS PORTS, MSL10HAHDUM 3Y THS FIRST LORD OP THE ABMIRaliT.It was the practice up tc 1916 to issue home-killed meat to the Naval Forces in Home waters.     Since that date frozen meat has &quot;been issued - during the War years as a matter of necessity, and, later, in the interests of economy,2o     Prom the point of view of the admiralty, there would be no administrative difficulty in reverting: to the supply cf home-killed beef, where practicable, for the period October to March,     Following the pre-war arrangements, contracts would be made for the supply of fresh beef at the Naval Ports, the contractors slaughtering- the cattle in the Naval Abattoirs in the Victualling Yards at Chatham, G-osport, Portland and Plymouth, which are new used for the receipt and issue of frozen meat.   Estimates have been called for of the cost of putting these slaughterhouses into working condition;   the amount is not expected to be appreciable,,   Incidentally, other accommodation would have to be found at Plymouth for the work of parting torpedoes, as the Second Submarine Flotilla are occupying, temporarily, a portion of the slaughterhouse building for this purpose,.   The contracts at Ports round the coast would hare to be adjusted to provide for the supply of home-killed beef,  instead of frozen beef, during this period,3B     It would still be necessary to supply frozen beef to sea-going ships fitted with refrigerators, on certain occasions, e*gv when filling up before proceeding to sea.4o     Financially, the proposal would involve an extra -charge to Navy ^Totes, estimated at about  45,000 for the six months in question, for which no provision has been made inthe
the hstimates for the current year.5.     If home-killed beef is issued during a certain period of the year, it is considered that there would be a tendency in the j?ieet to criticise the supply of frozen beef during the remaining period, and the Admiralty may have to face a request, later, for the supply of home-killed beef entirely in Horns SVaters, with the consequent additional financial liability.,60     Having regard to 4 and 5, and to the fact that frozen meat gives satisfaction in the Pleet, the Admiralty would prefer not to adopt the proposal0A.
