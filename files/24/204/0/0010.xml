THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT *toC    A    B    I   N    E_T.SECRET.CP. 162/Position In regard to the New Construction Programme and Singapore Base.j* *****       &quot;*&quot;       *&quot; &quot;***&quot;*&quot;* **Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.(l) Nej? Construction ProgrammeaThe question of the policy to be adopted In regard to the 1928 programme of New Construction raises itself for consideration, owing to the necessity for deciding whether tenders now in office for the machinery of the two Cruisers announced to be built in the Dockyards are to be acceptedj and after consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer I desire to place the present position, as I have been able to ascertain It, before the Cabinet.The 1928 Programme of New Construction consisted of the following:-2       10,000 ton Cruisers, building at Portsmouth and Devonport respectively.1       Submarine Depot Ship, building at Chatham.1       Leader and 8 Destroyers, building by the following firmsLeader at Vicker&apos;s,  Barrow. 2 Destroyers on the Clyde,John Brown &amp; Co. S Destroyers on the Tyne, at HawthornLeslie &apos;s,  Palmer31 and SwanHunter&apos;s.6       Submarines1 at Chatham.3 at Vickers &apos;,  Barrow.1 at Beardmore&apos;s on the Clyde.1 at Cammell Laird fs,  Birkenhead.4       Sloops 2 building at Devonport.2 on the Tyne, at Swan Hunters &apos;1       River Gunboat.      Order not yet placed.-or-.1&apos;&apos;:&apos;- ^      &apos;;:.;r,;v;:..- &apos;jThe estimated expenditure on this programme, based on th Admiralty estimate of the progress of work is as follows 1929  2,880,0001930  5,465,0001931  1,949,000
But in the Navy Estimates for 1929 a lower rate of progress has been provided for in order to discount the possibility of delays, under the system of the &quot;shadow cut&quot;, and a figure of approximately  2^500,000 only has been included,  leaving  500;,000 more to fall on subsequent years if only this slower rate of progress is realised in 1929.  (The above figures are approximately te only)The position as regards the construction of these vessels at the present time is as followsCRUISERS, Hulls i    Orders for these have been placed andmaterial for construction is being collected in the bwo Dockyards.     The keels have not yet been laid down and relatively little expenditure has been incurred.CRUISERS, MACHINERY:    Orders for the machinery have not yetbeen placed although tenders have been received and the two constructing firms have been decided upon.CRUISERS, Armour: The orders for the armour have not yetbeen placed0CRUISERS, Gunmountingss   She order for the turret gainmountingswas placed in 3ebraary with Yiokers ArmstrongsSUBMARINE DEPOT SUP.    has been ordered at Chatham andmaterial has been collected.     Preparations for construction are probably rather further advanced than in the case of the Cruisers as she was ordered earlier.THE LEADER AND DESTROYERS were ordered from the contractorsabout the end of February, and as these vessels only take 2 years to build, considerable progress will have been made on materials oThe orders for the SUBMARINES were placed in March, and theposition is much the same as with the Destroyers. ,The orders for the SLOOPS were placed early in February, andas these vessels only take 18 months to build, more progress has been made in their case.The cost of stopping all work on the ships of this programme would not be very great as regards refunding money already spent by contractors - say  250,000 to  500000, but in addition the firms will have committed themselves to sub-contractors, and also they would undoubtedly be justified in claiming for loss of profit and dislocation of programme.it;
It Is not possible to say without further investigation what sums might be Involved,As regards the effect on employment In the Dockyards,the result of stopping the Cruisers and the Submarine Depot Ship would amount this year to throwing out of work about 400 men in each of the three Yards.     Next year this figure would rise to 600 or 700, and in the following year to about 1400.    In addition the cancellation of the Submarine at Chatham would affect about 200 men.     Cancellation cf the prograsnme would also affect the Dockyards in other respects,  such as work on Torpedo Tubes and other material which the Dockyards make for all classes of ships.      This might be put at 300 men for all the Yards.As regards Contractors,  it Is difficult to give any estimate, but on the basis of Q5% of the total cost of contract work going to labour, which is believed to be an approximately correct figure, the total sum involved works out at the equivalent of about 15,000 men at the most and 12,000 at the lowest.One or two other points should be mentioned. (1) As regards heavy gun mountings,  these are only made byone firm, vickers-Armstrongsand the plant required for them is kept specially for Admiralty requirements.    If idle, it becomes an unremunerative overhead charge on the firm, who would press for compensation for it.(2) Armour. - Armour is made by 5 firms,  who maintainspecial plant to meet Admiralty requirements.    If no orders -are placed,  this plant likewise becomes unremunerative, with similar resulting claims.(3) The same applies to heavy guns,  shell and rangefinders.As regards the 1929 programme of New Construction, no commitments would,  in any case, have to be entered into&apos;before the autumn.      Iaassume that before any steps are taken to proceed with it,  the whole question of this programme should be brought before the Cabinet for consideration.
(2)    SINGAPORE   BASE.At the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I also set forth the salient figures in connection with the Singapore Base0The modified scheme for the Naval Repair and Storage Base Is estimated to cost  7,750,000 in addition to the cost of the floating Book (about  930,000), and exclusive of military and air expenditure.Of this total about  70 0,000 (as well as the whole cost of the Floating Pock) had been expended up to the 31st March lasto    The bulk of this expenditure has been met from contributions made by the Malay Statess Hong Kong and New ZealandaThe contract for the main part of the Works (the Graving Pock and facilities connected therewith) was placed with Messrs Sir John Jackson (Singapore), Ltd., on 27th September, 1923o    The time for completion is 7 years from 27th September, 1928o    The amount of the contract Is  3,72l,474o     The contract provides for an advance of  600^000 to the Contractors to provide plant9 but up to 31st March, 1930, the advance is net to exceed  355,000. The  600,000 is to be repaid, when earnings on permanent work reach  1,000,000, by means of deductions from subsequent earnings: in the meantime the plant remains the property of the Admiralty.Up to 11th June,  80,&quot;000 had been advanced for plant.The contract also provides that payments on permanent work and advances on plant shall together not exceed  455,000 up to 31st March, 1930.It is believed that the Contractors&quot; liabilities and commitments to date are approximately  800,OOOoIn /
