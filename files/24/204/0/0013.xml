Exceptions to this rule are - sometimes made;    for example, Soviet citizens are in special circumstances allowed to come here as visitors to British relatives who undertake responsibility for their maintenace or as delegates to attend important Conferences. The result of this policy has been that as a general rule applications by Soviet citizens to visit this country for private reasons have been refused.The reasons given by Trotsky for his desire to come here are entirely personal and do not appear to be likely to promote any British interests   and his presence in this country does not seem   essential to carry out any of his alleged objects.      He has advanced no special grounds which merit exceptional treatment.There are, however, very special considerations which arise-from Trotsky1s personal record.      As my colleagues are aware, Trotsky was expelled from Russia as a result of a profound divergence of opinion with Stalin on the method to be pursued in achieving their common end, and was ultimately a].lowed to take up residence in Turkey.      He has recently applied for permission to
enter Germany, France, Belgium and Norway, but these Governments have refused him admission.    He made no application to come to the United Kingdom until after the General Election and his reason for applying now may be gulajged from a telegram to one of my colleagues that he hopes for a favourable decision from the New Government.From the point of view of our foreign relationships, the admission of Trotsky to this country might be regarded as an unfriendly act by the Soviet Government, and they might allege that the British Government has given hospitality to Trotsky for political reasons and was using him as a means of weakening the position of the existing Government in Russia.      It might be represented as dictated by fear of Communist activities in India, China and the East generally and designed to shake the prestige of the Third International and the Soviet regime as a whole.His admission to Great Britain might also be interpreted by the Governments of France,  Germany, Belgium and Norway as an adverse reflection on their refusals to admit him.Moreover, Trotsky&apos;s admission could not be without effect on the Communist parties in other countries, notably Germany and France, v/here his supporters would be encouraged and strengthened by the apparent support given to him by the British Government.From the point of view of domestic policy, the most important consideration seems to be the danger of admitting to this country an alien who would almost certainly become a centre of intrigue against a foreign Government with whom we desire to enter into friendly relations.      It would be futile to make it a condition of his admission that he should not engage in any political activities.      He could not be expected to abstain from politics and it would be necessary to keep a watch at the public expense on his activities.      It may also be observed that the Norwegian Government declined to admit Trotsky on the ground that in view of possible attempts on his life by political
enemies or by individuals ruined by the revolution in Russia they could not hold themselves responsible for his safety.      If he were admitted here it would be necessary to take special precautions to protect his lifeoAn equally important consideration is that once admitted there will be no practicable means of removing him should the necessity arise.      He could not be deported except to Russia and it Is almost certain that unless t-heir attitude changes the Soviet Government would refuse to admit him at the request of the British Government-      It is unlikely that Trotsky could obtain a visa good for return to Russia and unless we are prepared to acquiesce in his permanent residence here,  irrespective of his behaviour and Its consequences, I think that the practical difficulty of removing him is in itself almost a conclusive argument against allowing him to come.It must be remembered also that Trotsky is only one of several who have been expelled from Russia^ and if Trotsky were allowed to oome it would be Impossible to resist the applications of a flood of other exiles a,nd refugees who would cite his case as a precedent.Whatever the decision, it is certain that there will be criticism.      If he is admitted, the    organs of the Communist party and its sympathisers both here and abroad will proclaim his admission as an act hostile to incipient good relations with Russia, while the mass of the British public, who regard Trotsky only as one of the Bolsheviks who made the Russian Revolution, will probably represent his admission as  &quot;shaking hands with murderers&quot;n      If, on the other hand, his application is refused, the cry will be raised in certain quarters that on political grounds we have denied him the traditional British hospitality. I need&quot; hardly remind my colleagues that there is no traditional &quot;Right of asylum&quot;.      This misleading phrase has never meant a
right that an alien may claim to enter this country.      It means only, and has always meant only,  the right which this country can claim as against any other Government to give shelter, if -&quot;-it thinks fit, to any victim of political oppression abroad, On a review of all the considerations the arguments against giving shelter to Trotsky seem to me to be over-whelmingoJ .
