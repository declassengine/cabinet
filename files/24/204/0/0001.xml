These drafts are submitted fox&quot; consideration.2o A few notes in regard to the Cabinet Secretariat maybe useful to the Cabinet 03* There is a good deal&apos;of evidence in tho GrenvillePapers and elsewhere that in the last half of the eighteenthcentury and the early days of the nineteenth century cabinet minutes were kept*.      The original copy was sent to the King,1.*JT02S. The existence of Cabinet Minutes until tho younger Pitt became Prime Minister is fully berne out by Ming George III mind George IFrs papers, which were only discovered in 19.12 3 Tiiis has been confirmed&quot; to-jao by Sir John Portesoue, who has examiued these docnraents*    Tho following passage from an&apos; article on the subject by Sir John Portcssus in &quot;iCie Times&quot; of November 4, 1925, Is of interest in this eonnoation:-&quot;itat a frequent occurrence in all of Gsorgo III&apos;s Administrations until Pitt became Prime Minister T&quot;&quot;as that Ministers sent the Ming a Minute of Cabinet and forgot to keep a copy of it.    Then thoy asked for it to bo returned; and the request, though eom-plied with,was not always unaccompanied by just rebuke. Occasionally tho King did not restore it until ho had taken a copy with his own head,on at least one occasion through sheer good nature,to save trouble to a harassed Minister, but more often evidently from distrust of his careless habits&quot;* M*?oA.K.
&quot;cut Ministers specially concerned sometimes kept a cop3r.      These Minutes were probably drawn up by the Minister who summoned, the Cabinet, for in those days it was the right of the head of the Department chiefly concerned in a particular quostion to summon a Cabinet to discuss it when he thought desirable,, During the nineteenth century the practice of keeping Minutes died out.     At the time of the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, the only record kept of Cabinet Meetings was the Prime ministers letter to the Sing, which often contained only the briefest reference to the subjects discussed, and of which only one copy existed in the personal custody of the Prime Minister of the day.     There was no Agenda Paper, no central system for the distribution of documents? for the notification of Cabinet decisions to members, or for the co-ordination of the work of Cabinet Committees.4. From tho very aoaent of strained relations In1914 the dlsadvantages of this lack of system made themselves felt.     During tho first half of the War these defects were mitigated hy the concentration of much of the.war business in a War Council or War Oemmittees the Minutes of which were recorded by the Secretary to the Committee of Xtaporial Defence.
When the second Coalition was formed, in December, 1916, all Cabinet business was concentrated in a small War Cabinet, with a Secretariat,   .4s the War cabinet was in constant session, often two or three times a day, the Secretary was allowed to bring Assistant Secretaries to the meetings, and a very full record of the proceedings was kepto5. After the War, in November, 19193 theGovernment of the day reverted to a Cabinet of pre-war dimensions;, &quot;but retained the Secretary *    The custom of allowing the presence of Assistant Secretaries was dropped (except occasionally, in times of gx-eat crisis2 when meetings of the Cabinet were very frequent), and the proceedings were kept by a single secretary^etary, who attended all Meetings except on one or two occasions when there happened to be some question before them which the Cabinet preferred, to discuss privatelyc6 e The duties of the -Secretory under each government since 19SS have been to keep a list of subjects awaiting consideration by the Cabinet; after taking the Prime Minister1&quot; s
instructions to circulate the Notice and Agenda Paper together with relevant documents,  for meetings;    to attend meetings of the Cabinet, unless it was otherwise decided, for the purpose of recording Conclusions;    after obtaining the Prime Minister&apos;s approval,  to circulate the draft Conclusions to The King for information and to Ministers, who,  in practice, returned them to the Secretary with any suggestions for amendment.      A final version,  incorporating amendments, was,  after approval by the Prime Minister, forwarded to Members of-the Cabinet for record. Ministers were thsaS elves responsible for instructing: their Departments as to the action to be taken to carry out conclusions.7.    Every possible precaution is taken to ensure the secrecy of Cabinet Conclusions.      The minimum personnel is employed to reproduce them, and only the minimum has access to them.    Thus, for the reproduction of the Minutes a single Confidential Stenographer who has been in the Cabinet Office for many years, is employed, and he destroys his notes immediately they are transcribed.      A Chief Clerk &quot;rolls off&quot;  the Roneo-ed copies and seals them up immediately in special envelopes, which are marked &quot;To be opened only by the -person to -whom addressed.&quot; These envelopes are locked in the usual Cabinet boxes.    Besides the Secretary of the Cabinet, only bis Private Secretary has a key of the safe in which the standard copy of the Conclusions is kept.8.    The present holder of the post of Secretary of the Cabinet is also Clerk of the Privy Council (of which the Cabinet is a Committee)  and Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Deputy Secretary acts for the Secretary in the latter&apos;s absence, and is in addition joint Secretary of the Home Affairs Committee and Secretary of the Committee of Civil Research. He is assisted in regard to the work of the latter Committee by
a Treasury Principal,  who acts as Secretary toall Civil Research Sub-Committees.      The onlvother administrative officer in the Cabinet Secretariatwhose duties are devoted exclusively to the work of theCabinet is an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury,who acts as liaison officer with the Treasure andunderstudy to the Secretary and is Secretary to the HomeandAffairs and other Standing/^d hoc Cabinet Committeea.9.      It is part of the duty, of the Treasury liaison officer,to ensure that the Cabinet and Cabinet Commit tees are onlyInvited to reach decisions after the subject matter beforethem has been thoroughly examined by the various Departmentsconcerned.      The procedure approved by the late Governmentwhich was based upon and closely followed that adopted byprevious Governments, is embodied in Treasury Circular of17th November,  1924,   (Appendix III),  from which the followingrelevant passage is extracted :-&quot;In future all memoranda,  draft Bills and other constituents of the Agenda will be sent to the Cabinet Secretariat for circulation only after their subject-matter has been fully examined between the Departments from vfiich they emanate, the Treasury,  the Lav; Officers where  contentious Bills are Involved,  and any other Department concerned,  and these documents will bear on the face of them a specific statement that this examination has taken place.      The documents should be made as complete as possible by containing the various arguments and criticisms which might be brought against the proposals advocated.     &apos;Tp enable the members of the Cabinet  (and Cabinet Committees)  to have time to  consider proposals intended for Cabinet decision and in view also of the possibility that such inter-De part mental&apos;   , examination may result in definite differs?c-f opinion necessitating the preparation of memoranda by the dissenting Department or Departments, no memoranda,  draft Bills,  etc., which originate proposals for Cabinet decision will be placed . on the Agenda until an interval of at least five days has elapsed after  circulation, except on any occasion when the Prime Minister expressly authorises a relaxation of the rule.&quot;
. ^ 11Under this procedure the Chancellor of the Exchequer is given an opportunity of examining the financial aspects of any proposal before it is  circulated.      In addition it is the established practice,  save in very exceptional circumstances, not to place on the draft Agenda of the Cabinet, which is submitted to the Prime Minister for approval, items in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is interested without first ascertaining that the Chancellor Is ready/ for their considera-tion in Cabinet.10,      One important duty of the Cabinet Secretariat is the distribution of documents.     With the few exceptions mentioned below;,  all Cabinet documents are circulated from, the Cabinet Office.     Where the facilities are adequate,  as Is usually the case, the Memoranda are reproduced within the Department of the Minister concerned.,  and a sufficient number of copies are then forwarded to the Cabinet Office for distribution. In a few cases where Ministers have.net sufficient facilities-, the Memoranda are forwarded to the Cabinet Office for reproduction.      Before Issue to the Cabinet the Memoranda receive an official number and are indexed.      A circulation of Papers to Ministers takes place every evening from the Cabinet Office,  and oftener if required.      The only exception to the above procedure is in the case of Foreign Office telegrams and despatches and War Office telegrams, which are circulated to Ministers direct by the Foreign Office and &apos;v?ar Office respectively, unless they are specifically referred for consideration by the Cabinet,  in which case the normal procedure is followed.11.      The clerical and messenger staffs of the Cabinet Office,which perform the work of reproducing,  indexing, distribution,etc. are pooled with the Committee of Imperial Defence and theCommittee of Civil Research.      Tho Establishment Officer whois in charge of all these services,  and the Private Secretaryto the Secretary of the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial-6-
Defence, may be said to serve both the Cabinet and the Imperial Defence Committee.    The combined clerical staff (exclusive of messengers and charwomen) for the Office of the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence consists of SO persons.ABIKET [OMLilTTEES.12o Cabinet Committees fall into two main categories -Standing Committees, which remain in being and are ready at any time for the consideration of questions with which they are concerned, and Special ad hoc Committees, appointed by the Cabinet for the consideration of particular questions, the duties of which are, as a rule., ended when the Committees reoort to the Cabinetu13. In addition to the Committee of Imperial Defence, theStanding Committees of the Cabinet under the late Governmentwere five in number -The Committee of Civil Research, The Home Affairs Committee, The Unemployment Committee The Haval Programme Committee, The Expenditure CommitteeollITTEE 3IVI1 tARCH.14. The following notes indicate briefly the nature and scope Of the Standing Committees.,15o The Committee of Civil Research was established by theCabinet in Mayf 19 5, and its constitution and functions were set out In a Treasury Minute of 13th dune9 1925, and are 3s follows
&quot;The President of the Committee will be the Prime Minister and the regular Chairman, in the absence of the Prime Minister, will be a Minister nominated by him for the purpose:    the membership of the Committee will, as in the case of the Committee of Imperial Defence,  consist of such persons as are summoned by the Prime Minister, or the Chairman on his behalf. The Committee will,  like the Committee of Imperial Defence, be an advisory body and will have no administrative or executive functions.The Secretary of the Cabinet and of the Committee of Imperial Defence will be responsible for the Committee&apos;s secretarial arrangements which will be under the immediate supervision of Mr. T. Jones. The Committee will be  charged with the duty of giving connected forethought from a central standpoint to the development of economic, scientific and statistical research in relation to civil policy and administration and it will define new areas in which enquiry would he valuable.     Yrithin these limits the Committee may consider such questions as are referred to it by the Cabinet,   the President, the Chairman, and Government Departments,The President  (or Chairman) may also summon for consideration of particular business such outside economic,  scientific and statistical experts as he may think fit. The Committee will - on the arialogy of the Committee of Imperial Defence - as a normal part of its working approve the reference of particular enquiries to special sub-committees, which may include outside specialists as well as expert officers of the Department or Depart-ments mainly concerned,      Provision will also be made for using the services of suitable Departmental Officers in the capacity of Secretary to such sub-committees as occasion requires.&quot;16.    Since its establishment the Main Committee has held 26 Meetings and there have been numerous meetings of the various ad hoc Sub-Committees which it has appointed and through which much of its detailed work is done. 17.   As a rule the Prime Minister presided at Meetings of the Main Committee and in his absence the Chair was taken by Lord Balfour the Lord President of the Council.     Meetings were attended by such Cabinet Ministers and other persons as the Prime Minister may decide to summon,  and in the past the Lord President of the Council,  the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Colonies, the Secretary of State for war, the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Agriculture have frequently attended meetings.18.   Among important questions examined by the Main Civil Research Committee are the following -19.      Inquiry into the position of the Iron and Steel Industry, British Dyestuffs Corporation - sale of Government interest in, Electrical Development,  Overseas Loans, Report of the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry, Unemployment in the Coal Industry.29.   Among questions referred to special Sub-Committees are the following - those marked with 15 are still in being -xTsetse Ply,stMineral Content of Natural Pastures. siSevern Barrage *Indian Railways-^Empire Supply of Quinine. iiDIetetics.Agricultural Training,British Pharmacopoeia. nEe se ar ch C o - or d inat i on,Kenya Native Welfare.Geophysical Surveying.Great Barrier Reef Expedition.Rubber- Restriction-.Mechanical Transport. ^Irrigation Research. xLocust Control. k Ciianne 1 Tunne 1.Radium Supplies.21.   The composition of the Sub-Committees varies with thesubject matter, but as a rule the membership of those dealingwith technical questions  consists of persons of distinctionunconnected with the Government.      For example,  the composition of the Channcel Tunnel Sub-Commit tee is -Mr. E.R.  Peacock      (Chairman)&apos;Lord EbbishamSir F.W. LewisSir Clement Hindle3&apos;-Sir H. Strakosch.
2 ,      The Radium Sub-Committee was presided over by Lord Rayleigh,  and among its members were the President of the Royal Society,   and high officials represented the interested Departments. -?.      As in the case of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Secretary and Assistant Secretary are given the help in special cases of a joint Secretary from a Department mainly concerned with a particular inquiry.Z4.      The Cabinet Office are responsible for the secretarial arrangements of the Committee of Civil Research,  for the circulation of its Papers,   and the preparation of Its pro-ceedings and of those of its Sub-Committees.      All Reports and Conclusions of the Committee and Its Sub--Committees are printed and come before the Cabinet for approval before action is  taken upon their.,S5.      The Committee of Civil Research also deals  with all invitations received from Foreign Governments for official participation in International Scientific Congresses and similar bodies,  and appoints the Government representatives at all such me e t ings.
A   ftlbm5 AFfAIRS   26. The Home iff airs Committee was established by thefilTTEE.Vfar Cabinet in July 1918, and has functioned actively since that date.      Thirteen meetings were held in 1928 at which between 40 and 50 Draft Bills, the vast majority of &quot; which were Government Bills, were examined in detail.27. The Committee is an advisory Committee  (Appendix II)and its Conclusions and Recommendations are invariably submitted to the Cabinet for approval before action is taken upon them.      These Conclusions and Recommendations are embodied in the printed Minutes of the Committee which afe circulated to all members of the Cabinet as well as to the members of the Committee.      In due course the recommendations are placed on the Cabinet Agenda and each of then forms the subject of a separate Cabinet Conclusion. 28. The Home Affairs Committee was originally concernedwith questions of Home legislation and general administrationexcepting Unemployment questions which foil for consider-ation to the Unemployment Committee, and questions referred by the Cabinet to ad hoc Committees.    Questions of foreign, Dominion or Colonial affairs very seldom came within the purview of the Committee, and then only in so far as the Home aspect of a particular question under consideration might bo affected.    The same applied to Service Department questions.29. In approving the constitution of the Committee in1924  (Cabinet 8(24) Conclusion 8), the LabourtCoverument stated that the function of the Committee &quot;should be as in the past to relieve the Cabinet of the detailed considerationof the large volume of legislative and administrative work referx^ed to the Cabinet, while leaving to the Cabinet tho ultimate decision on these questions&apos;1.     hver since 1924 however, the principle function of the Home affairs Committee
  has boon to examine, particularly from the legal point ofview, Government Bills and other important Bills, and to make recommendations to the Cabinet on drafting and other questions of dotail,resex-ving all major questions of policy for Cabinet decision.SO. Under the existing px^ooodure, which has been continuously observed since the \7ar, no ordinary DepartmentalBill &amp;a,y be submitted to Pax*liaaent until after it has been subjected to examination in the Home Affairs Committee and the Conclusions of thai Committee have been approved by the Cabinet.      In practice, the examination in the Home Affaix^s Committee of these Bills has been most xisoful and helpful, particulax^ly in two directions.    In the first place, an opportunity was given for Ministers in Departments other than the Depax-tment of origin of the Bill;, to express their views as regards matters, ofton of minor importance, directly or indirectly affecting their&apos; Department, and secondly, the Law Officers were enabled to discuss the legal aspects of the legislative proposals with their colleagues and to explain the numex^ous legal and technical difficulties which often arise on Bills.   As a. result of the detailed consider-ation in the Committee, agreed modifications and amendments were often introduced into the Bills at this stage and difficulties were i&apos;emovod by discussion which would other-wise involve considerable departmental correspondence, loss of time and Parliamentary embarrassment.31. Another very useful function of the Homo AffairsCommittee has been the consideration at the commencement of each Session of the Governments Legislative programme in relation to the Parliamentary time available and the Committee has made suggestions to the Cabinet as to which items in the legislation suggested by the Departments should be expedited,, defexrcod or abandoned.12.
 2. Tho composition of the Home Affairs committee under the two last Governments was respectively as follows Labour government Conservative Government.Lord Haldano Lir, Clynes lord ParmoorLord Chancellor Lord Privy Seal Lord PresidentLord Hailsham.Lu?o Henderson   Home secretary sir Wo Joynson Hicks.Mr? w&quot;heatley ColltfcdgwoodMr BV/U Grahamllinister of Health.Mr, N* Chamberlain *Chancellor of the -Duchy of Lancaster&quot;Financial Secret-     Mr&amp; A^Iio Samuel, ary to the Treasury.President of the Board of Trade.minister of Agri-culture &amp; FisheriesSir Po Cunliffo-Listor.

Sir Bo Merriman.lh?o P.Bo Howorth (Assistant Socx^etaryGabinet).33. It will be observed that, with the exception of thePresident of the Beard of Education, the CcmmittiGe under the late Govexnamert contained ministerial representatives of all the Dopax&apos;allotments which commonly bxMng questions before it.Having x*egard to the legal aspects of the gx^eat majority of those questions, tho Committee has always included the Attorney-G-eneral and the Solicitor-General, while, since 1923the Lord Chancellor for the time being has been Chaixmianof the Committee, the Homo Secretary, as a xmlo, acting as chairman In his absence *     Treasury x-eprosentation on theCommittee is essential and the Financial Socretax*y hasalways boon a Membcru   Experience shows the groat advantages of including on the permanent membership of the Committee13.
the Ministerial Heads of those Departments which are mainly concerned with Home questions  (The Board of Trade, M health, Agriculture,  Labour,  Scotland, Education and Post Office) .34.   The secretarial arrangements of the Home Affairs Committee are undertaken by the Cabinet Offices which are responsible for the circulation of papers and the preparation of the Committee&apos;s Minutes.     All memoranda and other docu-ments considered by the Home Affairs Committee receive full Cabinet circulation.PLOY-&quot;ITTEE.35.      The Unemployment Committee was first appointed at theCabinet In August,  1920  (Cabinet 48 (20)  Conc].conclusion 2) and-has been re-appointed on the coming in Office of each successive Government,36.     Like the Home Affairs Committee, the, Unemployment Committee is an advisory body.      (See Appendix II).      Its Conclusions and Recommendations were incorporated in period-ical Reports which were submitted to the Cabinet for anproval and the Minutes of the Committee were circulated to all Cabinet Ministers, whether Members of the Committee or net.osltion heitte-e-.37.    Then the Labour Government last held Office, the composition of the Unemployment Committee was as follows  : Mr. Sydney viebb,Mr. C lyne s Mr. Snowden. Mr. Wheatley Mr. Tom Shaw Sir CharlesTrevelyan. Mr. Jowett Miss Bondfield.Mr. smith mr. StewartMr. GoslingPresident of the Board of Trade(Chairman). Lord Privy Seal-Chancellor of the Exchequer. Minister of Health. Minister of Labour.President of the Board of Education.First Commissioner of Works. Parliamentary Secretary to theto the Ministry of Labour. Parliamentary Secretary to the k in i s t ry o f A gr i cu 1 tur e . Parliamentary Under Secretary ofState for Scotland. Minister of Transport.
38.     Th0 Unemployment Committee was re-appoint ad on the accession to office of the late Conservative Government and held, numerous meetings during 1924 and 1925.      The Committee has not, however, met. since 1925*&quot;29i    During the last three and a half years a number of special Cabinet Committees have considered the unemployment problem both as a.whole and as regards various particular aspects and remedies.     There have been Committees which have examined unemployment in the Coal Industry, and in the Iron and Steel Industry,  juvenile unemployment, and migration.      One of the most important was the Unemployment Policy Committee established by the Cabinet in July 1928 under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to examine the Report of the Industrial Transference Board. 40-   Up to the Autumn of 1925 the main Unemployment Committee had held 89 meetings and it had  circulated to it over 750 Memoranda.      It had always comprised Ministers responsible for the Departments mainly concerned with Unemployment, namely,  Labour, Board of Trade, Health, Agriculture, Transport, Scottish Office and Treasury. From time to time the Ministers or representatives of other Departments have attended meetings of the Committee. The Financial Secretary to the  Treasury has always been the Treasury representative, though when questions of great Treasury/ importance are under consideration, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been present at the Committee. 41.   The meetings of the Committee were as a rule attended by Departmental Experts,  and as necessary by representatives of such bodies as the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Forestry Commission.42.   The secretarial work of the Committee has always been undertaken by the Cabinet Offices,  which circulated theCommittee Papers and is responsible for the production ofthe Committee&apos;s Conclusions and Reports.-15-
TAYAL RAMJE ITTEh.4S.        In February, 1925, the late Government established a Naval Programme Committee to consider the programme of construction for the replacement of cruiser and other warships, including the building of aircraft carriers and the development of the Pleat Air Arm during the next few years;    as well as the manning of the Fleet and oil fuel supplies.44. The Committee was composed of Lord Birkenhead (chairman),Lord Balfour, LorO. Salisbury, Mr, Churchill, Mr* Bridgeman, Mr0 Neville Chsmiberlain and Lord Peel.    Lord Eailsham, then Sir Douglas Hogg&apos; , was added at a later stage, 1-5. After a number of Meetings the Committee reported inJuly, 1925, and in the Winter of 1927/28 they considered and reported upon the Cruiser Programmes for 1927/28, 1928/29, and 1929/30;    and also on the question of Naval Fuel Reserves. At that time the Committee was constituted a Sub-Gommittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence04 . In the Winter of 1928, Lord Birkenhead ceased to be chairman on resigning Office, and in April 1929 Lord Salisbury was appointed in his place.,1&quot;. In the Spring of the present year a suggestion was made that the Committee should examine the question of the Fleet Air Arm. but no formal reference to the Committee was made before the late Government left Office,48.        The Committee was purely advisory, and its procedure and secretarial arrangements approximated to those &apos;0f their Standing Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence Committees, 4.9. The proceedings and Reports of the Committee wereprinted, and no action was taken upon the latter until the Cabinet had approved the CommitteeTs recommendations.JllTTEM   50. Under the Coalition Government there existed a FinanceSXEBN-iRB.       Committee for the consideration of the more important financial questions.    The Committee was composed of the Prime Minister,
9 9the Chancellor d.f the Exchequer, three other Cabinet Ministers and the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury. The Secretary to the Cabinet and Ur0 Howorth acted as Secretaries to the Committee, the procedure of which closely approximated to that of the Cabinet.-.61. Ho such Committee&apos;&apos; was set iip by the Labour Governmentin 1924, but in April 192-5, immediately on their accession to Office, the late Government authorised the Chaneollor of the Exchequer to announce thoir intention to set up a Standing Cabinet Committee to revise Expenditure.5P,, Shis Committee was duly constituted in July, 1925,the membership being the Prime Minister (Mr0 Baldwin), thoLord Privy Seal  fiord Salisbury), the chancellor of the Exchequer(Mro Churchill), the Home Secretary (Sir Wc Joynson-Elcks),the Secretary of State for India (Lord Birkenhead), the first commissioner of Works (Lord Peel) and the President of theBoard of Trade  (Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister);    the Terms ofReference being to review the estimates of National Expenditurewith the object of making substantial reductions of the thecharges on/tax payer.      The Committee held frequent meetings up to the end of 1927.      The Secretaries were Mr&amp;  (Now Sir) A*W, Hurst and Mr., R.BC Eoworthj and the arrangements and procedure approximated to those of other Standing Cabinet Committees.KSO&apos;/      53. In the case of Committees specially appointed by the^ES.z^Lr&apos; Cabinet to deal with particular subjects the Cabinet Offices have &quot;been responsible for the circulation of Committee papers, Reports, etc, while, for the actual Secretarial work it has been the practice to tL&amp;vlte the Department mainly concerned to supply an Officer to act as Joint Secretary with Mr. Howorth, of the particular Committee.    In cases, however, where there Is no one Department peculiarly interested, in the question and also In eases where the Treasury aspects of the matter pre-dominate, Mr0-Howorth has acted as Secretary to the Committee,
9 154 .    Ths instructions to tho Secretary attached inAppendices I and II ha?o worked satisfactorily, and it is suggested that they might be adopted, at any rate &quot;       provisionally, pending furthor experience by the new Government,THE 55. Eto attempt has been made in this Paper toCOMMITTEEOP IMPBP-IAJi   summarize the machinery and procedure of the Commit too DEFENCE.of Imperial Dofencs which will form the-&quot;subject of a separate Memorandum^IS.

Government had before them at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 12th instant the Circular No. 11/24 of the 28th April last on the above subject.A copy of that Circular is printed hereunder and I am to state that H.M. Government have decided that the procedure therein indicated shall continue to be observed in its entirety.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,N. F. WARREN FISHER.No. 11/24.TREASURY CHAMBERS,WHITEHALL, S.W.28th April, 1924.Sir,I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of H.M. Treasury to acquaint you, for the information of , that H.M. Governmenthave had under careful consideration the question of insuring that the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees shall be invited to reach decisions only after the subject referred to the Cabinet has been thoroughly examined between each of the various Public Departments concerned.This elementary rule of business is essential if the Cabinet and its Committees are to have available all the facts and points of view requisite for an enlightened decision and are to be saved the possibility of hasty or uninformed conclusions.The observance of the rule is the more obligatory under modern conditions when the mass of Government business has so enormously increased, and as a consequence Govern-ments can only get through it efficiently if the issues presented for decision have been carefully investigated beforehand by the Departments in collaboration.The Cabinet feels sure that Departments are anxious to assist it in securing the observance of this rule, and has come to the conclusion that the desired object will be facilitated by the following procedure. In future all memoranda, draft Bills, and other constituents of the Agenda will be sent to the Cabinet Secretariat for circulation only after their subject-matter has been fully examined between the Departments from which they emanate, the Treasury, the Law Officers where contentious Bills are involved, and any other Department concerned, and these documents will bear on the face of them a specific statement that this examination has taken place. The documents should be made as complete as possible by containing the various arguments and criticisms which might be brought against the proposals advocated. To enable the members of the Cabinet (and Cabinet Committees) to have time to consider proposals intended for Cabinet decision and in view also of the possibility that such inter-Departmental examination may result in definite differences of opinion necessitating the preparation of memoranda by the dissenting Department or Departments, no memoranda, draft Bills, etc., which originate proposals for Cabinet decision will be placed on the Agenda until an interval of at least five days has elapsed after circulation, except on any occasion when the Prime Minister expressly authorises a relaxation of the rule.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,N. P. WARREN FISHER.(50277)  Wt. G. 110 600  11/24  H. St. G. 18
