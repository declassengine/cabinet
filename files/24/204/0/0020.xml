204DOCUMENTJ^JTHE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Copy No._24____(29) &quot; CABINET.SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENT OF POLICY. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I suggest that the first convenient opportunity should be taken of making a statement  (whether in reply to such a question as that set out or in the debate on the Address) on the following linesj-&quot;Q,.    To ask the President of the Board of Trade If the Report of the Woollen and Worsted Committee appointed in accordance with the Safeguarding of Industries procedure will be published; if it is still open to industries to make applioa-tion in accordance with that procedure;    and If he can state the Governmentrs intentions in regard to existing safeguarding duties.A.     The Report of the Committee appointed to consider theapplication for a Safeguarding Duty in respect of woollen and worsted tissues will be published without delay.    I may say at once, however, that the Government do not propose to ask Parliament to Impose a duty on these goods, and that they will nob be prepared to receive any further applications for safe-guarding duties.    As regards the existing safeguarding duties, while the Government have no intention of considering   -any applications for their renewal,  they propose to let them continue for the statutory periods for which they were Imposed unleee in any particular Instance it should be found that damage is being caused by the duty to some other substantial industry.
205Perhaps I may take this opportunity to say also that the Government propose   not to disturb the present position In regard to what are known as key industry duties, originally Imposed by Part I of the Safeguarding of Industries Act,  1921, and continued by the Finance Act of 1926./Ibte fpr Supplementaries. - The Committee of Inquiry into the woollen and worsted application answered the questions in.the White Paper in the affirmative, but pointed out that they were not oalled upon to report on other considerations,  such as the effect of a duty on the export trade and on the home consumer, which were matters for the consideration of the Government in making its final decision.The existing safeguarding duties expire on various dates from June 1930  (in the case of lace)  to June 19337&quot;.I have consulted tho Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is not in agreement with this proposal.   He suggests that the pledge not to repeal safeguarding duties is too definite, and is unwilling to go beyond the following&quot;As regards the existing safeguarding duties the Government cannot give any guarantee that they will be continued for the statutory period for which they were imposed, and reserve the right to propose the repeal of any or all of these duties if it is considered desirable to do so in the interests of the particular industries or because of injury which i3 being done by the duties to other trades or to the consumers.&quot; He also thinks it is going too far to commit the Government to continuing the key industry duties in force for the full period of 10 years from 1926.Board of Trade,
