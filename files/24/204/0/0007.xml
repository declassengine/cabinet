ETEER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTED ON llTNE MPL01T/IENT c1. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL observed that many of theproposals contained, in the Departmental Memoranda circulated since the previous meeting were attractive and involved the expenditure of large amounts, but great efforts had heen made and vast sums expended In the past and yet the problem had hardly been touched;   a solution called for proposals of a much wider nature than those now before the Committee.     In this connection it was pointed out that from 1918-1928 about  190 millions was expended on programmes of works in relief of unemployment, and that at no time had more than 75,000 men been employed on those works.TRANSFERENCE Iff REIkATION TO STATE-AIDED ROAD SOTEMSS.2. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum(D.U.(S9) 6) &quot;by Sir Warren Fisher, Sir H.J. Wilson, Sir S. Chapman and Sir Ce Kurcomb on transference in relation to State-Aided Road Schemes.In this Memorandum it was stated that, if sanction was given, the Ministry of labour could expand their scheme of Transfer Instructional Centres so as to pass 10,000 men annually through the Centres and to bring their projected total training capacity up to about 18,000 men per annum.     It was however Imperative and essential to success that work should be available for the men at the olose of their training period, and that the scheme under which Local Authorities get a higher State grant on their road works if they employ labour from the depressed areas, might be utilized to this end.After stating the objections to giving grants in excess of 75$ for major Improvements on ordinary Glass I roads, the Memorandum suggested consideration of some relaxation of the - requirement that 50$ of the labour should be taken from the depressed areas, and proposed that latitude should be given to the Ministry of Transport to reduce the percentage to as low a proportion as 20$ if, after consultation with the Ministry of labour, it
9roappeared that the circumstances of tho particular area justify relaxation of the standard requirement.To moot the point that labour from the depressed areas is of lovr efficiency, the Ministry of labour are prepared to undertake that except where the men are clearly suitable in all respects, all men sent to tho schemes shall be men who have passed through one of their Centres.The Committee agreed -(a) To approve the proposals contained in DoUsf29) 6 and summarised above.(b) To request Sir H,J. Wilson to make enquiries as to industries which might be willing to open factories In the distressed areas with a view to consideration by the Committees of the practicability of some inducement being offered to them to do so.3* 2ho Committee had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of transport  (D0TJ. (29) 3) on Roads and Bridges,and agreed -(1) To approve In principle the proposalcontained in paragraph 15 for the extension of the 1924&quot;25 TrrLuk Boad Progras^me by dealing with a further 550 m*iles at&apos; an estimated cost of  9,500,000, to be spread over a period of 4 or 5 years.(2) To approve in principle the proposals for a further programme* of general rep onstruction of other important roads summarised in schedule 2 to DaUsf29) 3 by dealing over a period of 5 or 6 years with a total additional mileage of 1785 miles at an estimated total cost of about  28,000,000.(z) To authorise the Ministry of Transport subject to agreement with the Treasury as to the ba3.is of financing the schemes, to open negotiations forthwith with the Authorities concerned in order that works may be put in hand as&apos; soon as possible after the conclusion of the negotiationo-(4) That works in (1) and (2) above should not be excluded merely because they are situated in distressed areas, but that each such case should be considered on its merits0(5) That, as suggested in. paragraph 17(d), the authorities should be requested to make emergency arrangements for the conduct of business during the Summer recess.2.* This programme covers items tinder headings TWidening and Reconstruction1,  &quot;New Roads and Diversions&apos;,  &quot;Reconstruction of Bridges1.
The above decisions had regard, to tho considerations set out in paragraph 17, and particularly to the fact that in the case of (l) above in counties   it will bo necessary for the entire cost to be borne by tho Road Fund, and that in no case will it be possible to insist on the percentage of imported labour from tho distressed areas being higher than 50 per cent.onion Bridges (6)     Lambeth Bridge and Approaches  a Major Roaituprovements in Ghertsey Roadlie London Traffic oa^ Hampton Goui^t Bridge and Approach RoadVictoria Look Road-Putney bridge the LORD PRIVY SEAL requested the Ministry of take such steps as may be practicable to Transport to/expedite the above undertakings,(all ofwhich are in progress or to commence in the near future]as much as possible *(73   Charing Gross Bridge and Approaches Watorloo BridgeAfter some discussion regarding the negotiations in progress between the Ministry of Transport, the London County Counoil and the Southern Railway, in the course of which the Lord Privy Seal intimated that the Government were determined that the scheme should be undertaken amd at the earliest possible moment, It wras agreed&apos;that the best course would be to make a further effort to reach agreement by negotiation.,   and that the parties might bo warned that In default of agreement recourse  would be had to ad hoc arbitration legislation.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL drew attention to a recenttelegram from tho Governor of Hong Zing (0.0.314(29)) to tho effect that the Chinese Minister of Pailways was willing to negotiate a contract with Reiss Massey &amp; Co, Ltd., a Hong Kong Company with British shareholders and capital for the completion of the Ganton-Hankcw Railway, and a loopline at Canton at an estimated cost of  5,000,000 to coae out of the  8,000,000 Boxar Indemnity remission money.      If the firm got ths contract they undertook to placo orders for material and railway stocks In Great BritainoMR. asHTCjS-G-WATEM stated that there was considerable doubt whether the Chinese Government had any power to give this contract to Beiss Massey &amp; Co. as undor a previous arrangement if foreign capital was to be used, the concession was held by the British and Chinese Corporation.     Moreover the British Government was pledged to observe tho terms of a Consortium, one of which was that contracts oust bo put out to public tender among the nations parties to the Consortium.
In these cix-cucastaneos It was doubtful whether the BritishGovernment could support a proposal which involved acondition as. to material of British origin and. manufactureaThe Foreign Office were in sympathy with the scheme and special consideration would be given to iteTItB LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that the Gommitteewex*e only concerned with the Unemployment aspect of thematter - and would be very glad if this Boxer remission moneycould be released in the special circumstances and,withov.tinfringing any principle, could be earmarked for the purposesuggestedoThe Gommittee agreed -To request Sir H*Po Hamilton to keep in touch with the Foreign Office on the question.THE ESPIAL     5o The Committee had before&apos;e them a Memorandum by thew THERAILWAY        Ministry of Transport  (DeU*(P.9) 9) on the repeal of thePASSSNGEHDUTY. Railway Passenger Duty aontaining the following px^proposals -(l) That the Government should give an assurance that they will support the proposal of the Railway Companies to obtain Parliamentary sanction for raising tho capitalized value of the duty charged for 1928 less 10$ (which they are to expend, on works for the development and, modernisation of railway transport) by the issue of debenture stock2 without being restricted (under Standing Order 153 House of Commons] to borrowing not more than 3-/3rd of the sum raised by Ordinary or Preference Stocko(q) That while no objection need be raised to the inclusionj, in the Great Western Railway Company1s Schemes, of proposals for an expedited replacement of assets rather than the creation of entirely new assetaa It should be stipulated, if such proposals are approved that they shall constitute a net addition to the normal expenditure on replacements? which the Company would otherwise Atuder taken during the next few years

(3) That in considering the physicalcharacteristics of the proposed works, regard should be had to the desirability of ensuring so far as possible that tho work is such as will yield a substantial amount of additional employment, and. that the modernisation or improvements proposed are calculated to enable economies to be effected or additional faciltios afforded to traders.   Works which will benefit freight traffic rather than passenger traffic should so far as practicable be given priority, but this principle cannot be rigidly applied to the Metropolitan Railway.No condition-&apos; should be Imposed that plant and equipment for the proposed works should be of British manufacture, or that as many of the orders as possible should be plaeed with private firms rather than be executed in the Companies1 shops, but that the assurances given by the Companies in regard to these matters should be accepted as satisfactoryThe Committee were informed that the Treasury did not wish to raise any objection to these proposals and agreed(l) That an assurance should be given to the Railway Companies that the Government will support proposals in private Bills to be promoted by the Companies to enable then to raise any additional capital necessary for the proposed works wholly by way of borrowing.(E)Tbat the proposals submitted by the Great Western Railway should be approved.(3) Ehat, In considering the proposals of the other Companies when made,, the principles set out in D.U.(29) 9 should be applied so far as practicable *The Committee agreed -outstanding including those containedThat the/Departmental proposals/in ,DoIJe fS9) Papers 1, 2, 4, 5, 5.1., 10, 11?15 and 17, should be referred for consideration io a Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Warren Pisher and that in cases where no question of policy or principle was involved and If the Treasury agreed the Sub-Committee might sanction the scheme, all other cases to be reserved for decision by the Main Committee.SPARTMENTAL CHEMES.
With reference to tho above SIR WARREN FISHER expressed the view that it would be highly dangerous to rescind in any formal way the condition regarding 50/0 of labour from the distressed areas,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL agreed and stated that there was   no necessity to depart from the terms of the existing circular in this respect but that in any negotiations the terms must be sufficiently elastic to enable agreement to be reached.7.     The Committee considered a Memorandum (D.U.  (29) 7)by the Department of Overseas Trade and were informedthat the main reason why the scheme had not been more successful was because of the uncertainty of Its duration.The Committee took note -(l) That the Lord privy Seal proposed to invite the Cabinet to authorise an immediate announcement that the scheme would be extended for a further period / after 1931, and that legislation for that purpose would be introduced in the autumn.(2) That in the view of the President of theBoard of Trade the question of the extension of the Export Credits Scheme to Russia should be considered in connection with the general question of Anglo-Russian relations.8.     In connection with the proposed conference between the Lord Privy Seal and the Railway managements the Committee were informed that the latter would probably ask what financial help the Government would give towards major railway schemes and that this would raise the question of policy whether the Unemployment Grants Committee should be allowed to assist works undertaken by railway and other companies.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL indicated that he proposed-8-An extension of 10 years was mentioned, but the view Was expressed that expert financial opinion might favour a shorter period.
to invite the Companies to disclose what they could undertake on their own acoount as their contribution towards unemployment relief and the improvement of transport facilities.     When the proposals were received it would be for consideration whether a grant in aid would give beneficial results.THE OUSE DRAINAGE SCHEME.9. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL requested Sir C. Howell Thomas to circulate a memorandum on the Ouse Drainage Scheme.SCHOOLLEAVINGAGE.INCREASEDPENSIONSFORWORKERS in industry. next meeting.10.    THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that with a view to consideration by the Gommittoe, Memoranda on these subverts,  should be prepared-11,   THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that he proposed to make a Report to the Cabinet at their Meeting on June 21st, In regard to the conclusions reached by the Committee.     It was agreed to hold the Committeers Third Meeting on Wednesday, June 26th, 1929, at 3 p.m.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.19th June, 1929.
