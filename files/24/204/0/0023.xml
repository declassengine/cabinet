[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1929.SECRET.CP. 175 (29).CABINET.GERMAN REPARATIONS.EXPERTS&apos; REPORT.Principal Questions for Consideration.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(Circulated with reference to Cabinet 23 (29), Conclusion 9.)THE proposals of the Experts relating to the number and amount of the German annuities and the safeguards necessary to prevent any economic disturbance as a consequence of their payment, no less than the proposals relating to their distribu-tion among the creditor countries, were framed only after protracted and exhausting negotiations. Nevertheless, in the result they are consistent with a close and conscientious study of the economic situation, and should not evoke any substantial criticism at the hands of public opinion in this country, where the necessity to limit German liabilites by reference to economic facts is well recognised. The actuarial average of the neAV annuity for 37 years is four-fifths of the amount of the standard Dawes Annuity (which itself was subject to increase in certain conditions). But the Dawes Annuities were transferable into foreign currencies only to the extent that the German exchange permitted; the Dawes plan was essentially provisional and experimental, and while the flow of American money into Germany facilitated the transfer of the annuities payable in the earlier years of the plan (substantially lower till the 1st September last than the standard annuity), there was no safeguard nor could any confidence be felt that the standard annuity could continue to be transferred in full. Our Balfour note arrears amount with interest to some  200 millions. Even with our Spa percentage of the present Dawes annuities of  125 millions per annum we could recover only a part of that sum. The German annuities now proposed by the Experts render the arrears in the main irrecoverable, for our Spa percentage of the new annuities can provide only a small balance over future cover for debts and Ihe amount required for the Dominions. This outcome was foreseen as probable. The attitude of the late Government &quot;is shown in the Summary of Events leading up to the Report.Upon the assumption that the Government will not wish to question the proposals of the Experts as to the number and amount of the German annuities, the proposals in the Report which require special consideration from the financial standpoint are (1.) The Bank scheme.(2.) The allocation and mobilisation of the unconditional annuity. (3.) The distribution arrangements generally.The questions (4) of deliveries in kind, and (5) of the Rhineland evacuationare also important, but they are not primarily financial, nor is the question of deliveries in kind one of sufficient importance to govern decisions as to the acceptance of the Report.The following is an attempt to summarise, very briefly, some of the considera-tions which will arise in connection with the first three of the above points.Copy No.     24
(1.) The. Bank Scheme. .... - t]The proposed Bank for International Settlements, combining, as it is intended to&apos; do, a&apos; number of different functions, will require to be considered from several different standpoints. &apos;   &apos;   -Its agency functions,&apos; in regard to the receipt and distribution of the German payments, are less important in themselves than in the ultimate object to which they conduce, viz., the abolition of-all the international political controls to which Germany is now subject. The Reparation Commission in Paris and the Agent-General in Berlin, and the Commissioners for Assigned Revenues, for Raiiway Bonds, for Industrial Bonds, and other Foreign controls disappear, and the obliga-tion of Germany is transferred into&quot;the economic and commercial sphere. Germany, subject to the liabilities it assumes under the plan, acquires complete freedom from foreign control over its internal affairs, and, so long as no postponement of transfers occurs, becomes a free agent, able to work out its economic salvation entirely in its own way. In this administrative sphere the powders of the Bank are wide. -Subject to the general conditions of the plan, it is to decide how the German payments are to be made, and how they are to be held, and when they are to be paid to the creditor Governments. It will have powers to withhold or suspend these payments, being guided &quot; on the one hand by the need for prompt action in the interest of the creditor countries, and on the other by the interests of the plan as a whole, including due consideration to the Bank by way of compensation for its services in managing the annuity.&quot; Generally, it will handle the whole annuity question. It will decide how Bonds should be marketed, and it will set aside such reserve funds as it considers necessary to meet the service of such Bonds. There is no provision for liaison between the Governments and the new Bank, which merely has to submit formal accounts at least once a year. This accords with the underlying policy of abolishing political controls, but, from the point of view of the British Government, it has to be recalled that not all of the seven Central Banks which will have the joint control of the newr Bank are in fact and by tradition equally independent of their respective Governments.The precise terms of the functions to be assigned to the Bank in the manage-ment of the Annuities will have to be drawn with great care. It would be in accordance with the traditional policy of this country to support proposals which would facilitate an economic as opposed to a political settlement of any difficulties which may occur in the future, but it may be found that, when the detailed powers of the Bank have to be defined, the other creditor Powers are not anxious to entrust it with the discretion proposed to be assigned to it in such matters. .On the other hand, the business functions of the Bank accepting deposits, granting credits, exchange operations, &amp;c. require to be examined from the point of view, not of Government finance, but of their effect on finance in the widest sense. A perusal of the Experts&apos; Report leaves no doubt as to their ultimate object. The Bank is to be an instrument for the promotion of world trade, a focus for the active co-operation of Central Banks and a means of surmounting obstacles to the successful working of the gold standard in Europe to-day. The well-known Genoa Resolution urged that so soon as possible a conference of Central Bankers should meet to frame measures.of co-operation with the ultimate object of securing the stabilisation of gold prices. In the interim the practice of informal practical co-operation has-under the impetus of the Bank of England grown apace, but the time has not arrived when a formal conference could be held with a promise of useful results. The project of the Experts approaches the same objective the stabilisation of prices from a new standpoint the standpoint of establishing on a broad base a Central Bankers&apos; Bank which will deal on a world-wide basis with the whole credit problem in the spirit of a Central Banking institution.No British Government least of all the present Government would lightly cast aside a proposal with this high objective. On the other hand, it cannot omit to weigh the opportuneness and feasibility of the project. The practical difficulties which present themselves for consideration are of the following kind : Assuming that the Bank attains the wide powers and resources that the Committee aim at,, its Directorate, derived from the Central Banks of many countries, might by majority rulings direct its policy to the detriment of a particular country, which might be this country.It might again prove a formidable competitor to the ordinary commercial business of the City of London, although in actual experience the question may not
be so much, whether it will cut out commercial&apos;houses of experience but whether it will be possible to secure from some of the participatory countries the right personnel to manage an international bank of this character with full efficiency. Its credit operations might also give rise to difficulties, and if directed solely to the expansion of German trade, might increase the competition of Germany with the export traders of this country to an extent greater than that necessary to enable Germany to meet its external&quot; liabilities. Its exchange transactions would not be known and might seriously affect current arbitrage business. It might well have the power to affect our exchanges at any moment by transferring funds from one centre to another. The Committee propose, indeed, that the Bank&apos;s operations should be co-ordinated with the policies of the Central Banks and that &quot; its investment powers shall never be used in such a way as to exercise a predominant influence over business interests in any country.&quot; But this may in practice be difficult to apply.It seems important also to weigh the proposal that the Bank shall keep a reserve, in gold or in gold exchange, of 40 per cent, of its deposits; if it were to keep such a reserve in gold, it would entail a new drain on the world&apos;s gold supply and, so far from helping, might impede economy in the use of gold. If the management of the Bank were entirely in enlightened hands, there would be no cause for apprehension on this point, but it is not improbable that the French, who will have two representatives on the Board while this country has one, will press for the adoption of the hoarding policy they themselves affect.These criticisms are set out as matters for study and for thought. On the other hand, few would look with confidence upon the existing situation, with its possibilities of a future gold shortage and of unharmonious relations between Central Banks. The Bank proposal is so essential a part of the Experts&apos; Report that, in principle, it must clearly be accepted by the Governments if they are to adopt the Report at all. Its merits and its defects are not matters on which the Treasury can advise with confidence, for many of the considerations lie outside Treasury experience. It will be necessary j therefore, to take counsel, with the British members of the Experts&apos; Committee and with the authorities of the Bank of England in order to form a judgment as to what safeguards, if any, need to be embodied either in the detailed scheme to be worked out by the Organisation Committee or in the provisions of the International Agreements which will have to be made for the purpose of setting the plan in motion.(2.) The Allocation and Mobilisation of the Unconditional Annuity.The proposals under which practically the whole of the unconditional annuity, equivalent to  33 millions per annum, is to be assigned to France and Italy are naturally likely to meet with criticism. It is proposed that the French Government should put up a guarantee fund rising to  25 millions, which will be available for covering the other creditor Powers in the case of any temporary postponement of transfers. Provided that the French Government agree to this proposal and effectively carry it out we have a valid answer to criticism, so far as such temporary postponements are concerned. There still remains the risk of a complete breakdown of Germany, which would leave the French in possession of the capital they had realized by marketing the bonds which are to be secured on the unconditional annuities, whereas the other Powers might get nothing more. But this risk is perhaps one which can properly be left out of account. Provided that after a breakdown involving abandonment of the plan Germany is able to pay as much as  50 millions per annum, that sum would provide margin for the service of the marketed bonds and also for shares for the remaining creditor countries upon the same proportions of distribution as govern the present plan. Or in other words on an annuity of  50 millions the Spa percentage shares of France and Italy would be greater than the sum requiring to be paid by Germany for the account of those countries on the bonds which they had sold. The proposal is no doubt on balance advantageous to France but the advantage is not easy to evaluate.We must also examine the possible repercussions of the issue of bonds secured on the unconditional annuity by or for the other Great Creditor Powers. The Treasury has always felt that the objections to marketing the German debt are that (a) owing to the state of German credit, it would mean an effective loss on realisation, and (b) it would tend to dry up the credit resources on which the transfer by Germany of the current, reparation annuities largely depends. But there might be an advantage in marketing German bonds, if the bonds are sold and retained in America,
United Kingdom Dominions   .. -France Italy Belgium U.S.A. OthersTaking the first 20 years alone, the loss to the United Kingdom, on the same tables, works out at the equivalent of  722,000 a year, arid the gain to the Italians works out at the equivalent of  1,173,000 a year, the balance being made up mainly by America, which loses in the first 14 years but gains later.What, real loss to Great Britain is involved as a consequence of the altered distribution is a matter of opinion. It depends on the relative importance which one attaches to the early annuities as compared with the later ones whether, in fact, one takes a short view or a long one and on the view taken as to the probability that the plan will remain in full force unmodified over a great length of time. But two things at any rate are clear, first, that the highest figure at which the loss to Great Britain can be put with any show of reason is  2,415,000 per annum (the result .for the 37 years at 5^ per cent.), and secondly, that for the purpose of argument between nations there is sound ground for using that figure in debate, because the basis on which it is founded is the basis which the Committee adopted for its calculations.* Strictly 3G years and 7 months, as the calculations exclude tho period April 1 to August 31. 1929. The -above figures, are corrected figures and the discrepancy between these and those given in Cabinet Paper 1(50 (29) is due to the discovery of errors in the calculations made by the staff of the.- Young Committee.:and (if as we have reason to believe the American experts regarded as possible) a block of between  100 and  200 million of German bonds could be issued on the American market, it might on balance be of advantage to us to secure our share of the capital, as the purchase price of the bonds payable to us by American buyers would relieve the strain on our exchange. As it is, under the Experts&apos; Report, we should not only have no appreciable share in bonds marketed in America, but we-might find the French or Italian Governments issuing part of their bonds on the London market, to the prejudice of our international credit position. It is true that they could only do so by agreement of the Bank of International Settlements, but we should have only one representative on that Bank and the prestige of the British market might make it difficult to oppose the operation.This question ought to be studied in co-operation with the Bank of England; it seems that we should aim at getting our due share 6f any Bonds marketed in America and persuade the French Government to market further bonds (if they want to mobilise them) solely in the French market so as not to endanger our exchanges or impede the flow of American loans to Germany.(3.) Distribution Arrangements.The most awkward questions arise in connection with the Experts&apos; proposals as to the distribution of the Annuities between the creditor powers.It is common ground that our primary test of the fairness of the distribution is a comparison with the results of the distribution of the same annuities on the existing basis which is compendiously called the Spa percentage basis and which is described later in this memorandum. The summary of the Report contains an analysis of this comparison which may be briefly recapitulated as follows : Some ambiguit3r exists about the arrangements contemplated for the current year but subject to this, taking the first ten years as a whole, the result of adopting the new method of distribution differs but little, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, from the Spa percentage basis, while over the same period the United States loses about  15 millions all told. If the losses and gains over the whole period of 37 years* are calculated, 5J per cent, interest table being taken, the average losses and gains are as follows : A year.  loss 2,415,000 loss 30,000gain 535,000 gain 1,840,000 gain 610.000 loss 480,000 loss 60,000
5217At this point it may be convenient to explain in some detail the existing arrangements for distribution and the way in which the new proposal is understood to have been reached. : .At present the distribution of German payments is governed by a series of inter-national agreements, mainly the Spa Agreement of 1920 and the Paris Agreement of the 14th January, 1925. Briefly, the German Annuities (after meeting the service of the Da-wes Loan and cost of Commissions and excluding current Army Costs) are allocated as follows : . .(1.) Arrears of Army Costs . United States of America ... ...      2,750.000till 1944United Kingdom   ... ... ... 645,000till 1937France    ... ... ... ... 855,000 till 19373.250,000(2.) Belgian War Debt -Five per cent, of the balance of the annuity (i.e., nearly  5 millions a year) is then allocated to the service of the Belgian War Debts to France, Great Britain and America. The British share of this is 39-4 per cent, or nearly  2 millions a year on average.(3.) Restitution One per cent, of the first  50 millions after deducting prior charges and 2 per cent, of the surplus is allocated for restitution, the bulk going to France and Belgium.(4.) U.S.A. Reparation Two and a quarter per cent, of the balance is then paid to America in settlement of their reparation claims, subject to a maximum of  2J millions.Allied Reparation consists of the balance of the annuity, after meeting these &quot;prior charges&quot; and is divisible in the following proportions: -Per cent.United Kingdom ... ... ... ... 20-07British Dominions ... ... ... 303France    ...         ... ... ... ... 54-4Italy      ...         ... ... ... ... 10Belgium ...         ... ... ... ... 4-5Serbia    ...         ... ... ... ... 5 0Others    ...         ... ... ... ... 30100-0The Inter-Allied Agreements assigned a share to the British Empire as a whole. At the Imperial Conference of 1921 it was agreed to allocate to the other parts of the Empire 13-15 per cent, of the British Empire Reparation receipts (i.e., excluding prior charges for Army Costs and Belgian Debt).These Agreements are valid and binding, whatever the amount of the German payments from time to time, until they are amended by mutual consent.Although the Report contains no indication of the manner in which the new-distribution proposals arose it is&quot; understood that they were in fact reached by starting from the existing arrangements for distribution and introducing the following alterations : (1.) The British and French claims for arrears of Army Cost, averaging^  280,000 and  320,000 a year over the 37 years, were transferred to-     : ;   Italy. .   ... - ,:, -* these are&apos;the equated1 annuities for 37 years corresponding, on the 5iper cent, basis to the annuities of  645,000 and  rta5,000 till 1937 referred to in (1) above on page 5.
(2.) The U.S.A. Claim for arrears of Army Costs was reduced so as to limit the amount recovered to, the same proportion as the amount already recovered by Great Britain and France. The United States Government are to receive 37 annuities of,  1,240,000 instead of 14 annuities of  2f millions.t   The &quot; saving &quot; was transferred to Italy.(3.) Out of the allocation of  1,900,000 to Great Britain for Belgian War Debt  770,000 was transferred to Italy and  1 million to France.(4.) A fresh allocation of  650,000 was given inside the annuities towards the Belgian claim for Marks (apart from the  1,250,000 claimed outside the annuities).The practical results of this procedure have already been stated; Great Britain gets cover for debts year by year, but for the rest is placed at a disadvantage, as compared with the existing basis, to an extent which on the 5^ per cent, table is equal to  2,415,000 per annum.!. If we now turn to the grounds which can be taken for objecting to the proposal, it will be found that a strong logical argument can be framed.As regards Italy, it is open to us to argue that there is no ground why we should surrender to her money which on the present basis would come to us; it is simply a concession extorted by the persistence of the Italian Experts. The arrangement by which they get full cover for debts in the last 22 years alone gives them a very substantial benefit over their Spa percentage; and they have no claim to more than their Spa percentage of the amounts distributed as reparations during the first 37 years. They have succeeded also in getting payments they make to us to redeem the gold deposited here during the war treated as a &quot; debt payment,&quot; like our payments to America, although it brings to them a corresponding asset. They obtained an unprecedentedly favourable settlement of their War Debt to this country on the understanding that they were ready to apply their full reparation receipts to the payment of their inter-allied debts, and it is little short of a breach of faith on their part now to claim an increase of reparations at our expense. Further, their reparations have been taken in the form of coal, to the detriment of South Wales, despite our remonstrances, and it is particularly absurd that we should now be asked to increase their share. A detailed note is attached, developing our case against the Italian claim.As regards the Belgians, the position is rather different, but it is equally strong so far as any concession is asked from us alone. The adjustment in favour of Belgium has been conceded by the Experts, so it is understood, as a compensation for loss sustained in connection with the Marks put into forced circulation by the Germans during the war. The Belgian claim on this account was rejected by the Peace Conference and dropped by the Belgians in return for the allocation to Belgium by priority of the first  lOO millions of German reparations. Accordingly, the Belgians made no claim.for any allocation out of the Dawes Plan in respect of these Marks; but, on the other hand, they obtained a very favourable settlement of their liability to repay the above-mentioned  100 millions. In fact, the settlement agreed upon by the Finance Ministers in 1925 (which consisted of the reduction of the Belgian percentage of future German payments from 8 to 4J per cent.) represented the retention by Belgium, at the expense of Great Britain and France, of approximately half their priority, i.e.,  50 millions. We have, therefore, every justification for refusing any special concession to Belgium under this head. But, on the other hand, if, for the sake of peace, Germany is prepared to pay some special compensation to Belgium under this head, and if all the other Powers agree that this payment should not be counted as part of the annuity available for distribution on the basis of existing agreements, we cannot very well refuse, without placing ourselves in a rather invidious position.If it should be decided to raise objection to the proposed concession to Italy involved in the new distribution, the manner in which the Experts&apos; proposals were reached makes it comparatively easy to isolate the question.   They proposed! (a) that we should waive, like France and America, our arrears of Army Costs( 280,000 a year), and(b) that we should waive a large part ( 1,800,000 a year) of the allocation toGreat Britain for Belgian Debt.\ The 14 annuities of  2J millions correspond on a 5i per cent, basis to 37 annuities of  1,720,000. Thus  480,000 per annum is &quot; saved.&quot;J The discrepancy between this figure of  2,415,000 and the detailed figures in the preceding paragraph is due to errors in the calculations of the Experts Committee.
7.2toAs regards the first point, we could insist that we should not be losers;, this position would joe substantially attained, either if the old arrangements were left standing, or if the arrears of Army; Costs were renounced in the same proportion as by America and France, provided that the amounts so released were redistributed as Reparations under the Spa percentages and not allocated to any particular country. On this latter basis the British Empire would receive 23 per cent, of  1,050,000, or, roughly,  260,000 a year. As regards the Belgian Debt, we could insist on receiving our full allocation in the same way as France. Supposing that these adjustments could be carried, no others would be required.      .   ,,It may perhaps be asked what of the arrears of our American Debt payments which now, with interest, amount to some  200 millions ? On any practicable basis that arrear is in the main irrecoverable. The Spa Percentage even of the full Dawes Annuity of  125 millions per annum would not have been sufficient to recoup us the wdiole of that sum. Actually, the Spa Percentage of the annuities now proposed would provide only the comparatively small sum (represented on the highest computation by  2^ millions per annum or  40 millions capital) which we are now discussing. More than that could not be obtained unless some argument could be invented for claiming and successfully claiming more than our Spa percentage. It certainly would not be difficult to frame such a case, as the relative conditions of the different Allied countries have altered materially since 1920.It is clear from Sir Josiah Stamp&apos;s earlier letter, describing the situation on the Committee, that the British Experts were entirely unable to maintain their stand for complete adherence to the Spa percentage basis, and that, in their considered view, rigid persistence upon that line would have brought the Committee to an end by dissension among the Allies. In the result the Experts expressly say that their scheme of distribution is an inseparable part of their Report, though this is a declaration which is open to question. The Dawes Plan contained no revision of interallied distribution, and the recent Experts Committee had no mandate to attempt any such revision.Upon the question of the distribution the Experts of the three Latin nations formed, it is understood, an inseparable block. In logic it is possible to isolate the question and direct an attack almost exclusively upon Italy but the presumption is that the Latin countries, like the Latin Experts, would stand together and there is a possibility that a far-reaching objection to the scheme of distribution would throw the whole plan into jeopardy. It is worth considering whether this risk might not be taken rather than submit to what is practically blackmail of this country.Whether it Avould be possible to ride out the storm and reach an altered agree-ment without receding from our position is for conjecture. The Experts Avere independent Experts. The late Government maintained that position with emphasis, and it retained a full right, just as the present Government has full right, to revieAV and consider the conclusions. But the Experts of the Continental nations Afere undoubtedly not independent in the same sense or the same degree. For better or AArorse those nations are certain to argue hoAvever unjustifiably as if the conclu-sions of the Experts Avere in substance binding on the Governments.The proposed settlement is essentially an American settlement. A distinguished American Avas the Chairman of the Expert Committee and he exercised a great influence upon its results. Intrinsically the terms of the plan must be more unacceptable to the United States Government. The financial sacrifice, although it amounts to  15 million for the first ten years, is too small to be a primary concern to a country of such resources, but the United States have always maintained the absence of any connection between German reparations and American debts. While under the neAv Plan the Debts remain payable upon the credit of the individual Debtor Governments, in a variety of Avays Reparations and Debts are linked together. . The progression of the annuities in the first 37 years is the progression of the Debt payments. Provision is made for a diminution of the annuities consequent upon any relief from Debts that America may concede. The annuities for the last 22 years are merely the Debt outgoings. The United States Government has not&apos; yet pronounced upon the scheme, nor could its attitude Avith certainty be predicted, but the indications are that America Avill accept.We can clearly approve the proposals of the Plan as regards the payments to be made by Germany and her liberation from foreign control. The question is ^whether we can sustain objections to the proposed distribution of these payments.
There are at present no indications of probable objections from the other creditor Powers, but they have little reason to object to proposals so favourable to them. It may be felt right to postpone decision on the issues which affect this country until the attitude of others is clear, though it seems impossible, especially in view of the facts set forth in the Annex, to allow the concession to Italy at our expense to pass without the strongest opposition.P. S.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1, June 24, 1929.ANNEX.Exposure of Italian Pretensions.The chief effect of the system of distribution proposed by the Experts is that Great Britain is to sacrifice a sum which on the b\ per cent, tables is equal to  2,415,000 per annum for 37 years, and that Italy is to gain a sum equal to three-quarters of this amount. There does not appear to be any logical ground for this arrangement. If a Power is willing to give up part of its share of Reparations, the normal consequence would be that the amount which it abandons should be redistributed amongst all the other Creditor Powers in the due proportions, and it is a novel principle to assign the whole benefit arbitrarily to one single Power. The arrangement is all the more difficult to justify, as it will give Italy a substantial surplus over bot;h her Spa percentage and over her debt liabilities. It is therefore inconsistent with the assurance given by the Italian Government during the debt funding negotiations, when they reiterated that they w-ould apply all their Reparation Receipts to the payment of their War debts. From the British standpoint, the proposal is peculiarly indefensible, as the Italians take their Reparations from Germany in the form of coal to the direct prejudice of the South Wales coal trade; and, considering the very generous settlement which we made of the Italian debt, we have every ground for refusing now to provide them with additional reparation receipts, which will accentuate our coal problem.The various objections which have been briefly summarised above are more fully developed in the course of this note.(1.) Italian Assurances regarding the Air-plication of their Reparation Receipts to the Payment of War Debts. During the negotiations for the settlement of their War Debts in Washington and in London, the Italians constantly stressed the fact that they were entitled to a comparatively small share of Reparations, and professed that they had a sort of Balfour Note principle of their own, i.e., they said that they were ready to apply the full amount of their receipts under this head to the payment of War Debts, but argued that they could not be expected to pay anything more. This argument had considerable weight with the British Government. At the time of the signature of the Italian War Debt Funding Agreement in London on the 27th January, 1926, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated, as one of the grounds for the generous settlement with Italy, that &quot; we have also taken into account the fact that Italy has only a comparatively small share of German Reparations. Count Volpi, the Italian Minister of Finance, who was the Chief Italian Delegate, in his reply stated : &quot; We have allocated our receipts from German Reparations to the sum total of our War Debts towards your country and the United States of America.&quot; Similar statements were apparently made by the Italian Delegate in America (see U.S.A..Debt Commission^ Reports, pages 353 and 356).In fulfilment of this policy, the Italian Government passed a decree law on the 3rd March, 1926, providing that their Reparation Receipts from the commencement of the Dawes Plan should be carried to a special account and applied to the payment of the War Debt Annuities to the United States of America and to Great Britain, any balance remaining over and above the current outgoings being invested at
5 per cent., to cover future payments. The successful working of this arrangement was referred to. in the financial statements made in 1927 and in 1928 by the Italian &quot;Finance Minister.Now during the period up to the 1st September next Italy&apos;s receipts, from reparations (with interest at 5 per cent.) will have exceeded her aggregate debt payments by a sum of close on  35 millions. If therefore the assurance given by the Italian Government were strictly fulfilled, all that they should claim would be cover for their future debt liabilities, minus the accumulated surplus of  35 millions already received. Apart from this they could not expect to get more than their Spa Percentage (10 per cent.) of the total German payments available for distribution as reparation in future, which would have just about covered their future debt payments.As a fact the Experts&apos; plan gives them much more than this. In the first place, they are to retain the full surplus of  35 millions already received. In the next 37 years, they are to have not merely their Spa percentage/which would fully cover their debt outgoings and leave them an average surplus of  800,000 a year, but they are to receive an additional allotment bringing this surplus up to about  2.500,000 a year. During the last 22 years, they are to get full debt cover, although this represents decidedly more than their Spa percentage. Both during the first 37 years and during the last 22 years they include as &quot; Debt Cover&quot; the annual payments ( 250,000 up to 1931 and  382,000 thereafter) which they make to Great Britain to repurchase the gold deposit of  22 - 2 millions made under the Agreement of 1915. These payments are in fact additional to their War Debt payments and in return they receive the gold.In view of the advantage during the last 22 years the Italian share during the first 37 years ought to have been reduced, rather than increased, While the Italian claim that they should receive a surplus of  2^ millions a year, over and above their debt outgoings at our expense, is little short of a breach of faith. The Italian Experts may say that they are not bound by assurances given by the Italian Government during the debt negotiations, but the Italian Government cannot take such a line.(2.) Summary of Italian Debt Settlements. The methods of the Italian negotiators in all these. discussions may be illustrated by their handling of the American and British Debt negotiations. The report of the United States of America Debt Commission (page 232) on the Italian settlement points out that the Italian Government owed Great Britain considerably more than she did to America,, and that Italy was legally and morally obligated to settle her indebtedness with Great Britain on at-least as favourable terms to Great Britain as the settlement with America. &quot;The Italian Commission recognised this principle,&quot; the Report says, &quot;and stated that they would offer a settlement with England on the same basis.&quot; In fact, the settlement they made here was very different. The American settlement provided for aggregate payments by Italy over 62 years, equivalent to the full amount of their capital debt ( 419 millions) with some  74 millions of interest, and it represented on the 5 per cent, tables a present value of approximately 21 per cent, of the capital debt at the date of the Funding agreement. The settlement finally reached with this country on the basis of a flat annuity of  4 millions for 62 years in respect of a debt of nearly  600 millions represented, in the aggregate, the payment of only about 40 per cent, of the capital debt without any interest, and its present value was about 14 per cent, of the capital debt at the date of the Funding agreement. Thus it may be said that the American settlement with Italy represented a scale of payments 50 per cent, heavier in proportion than the settlement made with this country; and that if the principle stated by the Italian Commission at Washington had been carried out, the Italian offer to Great Britain should have been equivalent to a flat annuity of  6^ millions instead of  4 millions. It is true that under our settlement we got substantially more than America during the first five years, and we get almost exactly the same proportionate amount as America during the next five years, and this was the justification for our accepting the settlement. But the fact remains that the Italian Delegation did not make an offer to this country proportionate to the settlement they have reached with America; that they insisted on all sorts of subsidiary concessions; and that they finally succeeded in securing a settlement of unprecedented generosity under which no less than 86 per cent, of their debt to this country was written off. This settlement has been ratified and it cannot now be modified, but at least we are entitled to refuse any further concessions to Italy.
(3.) Arrangements about&apos; Italian Gold. One of the least satisfactory points about the Italian Debt Funding Agreement was a provision under which Great Britain binds herself to repay to Italy the gold deposited here during the War. The history of this gold affords another instance of Italian pertinacity in obtaining -concessions from this country. In 1915, when we found it extremely difficult to maintain the Dollar Exchange and were exporting gold freely to America, we made an arrangement with Italy (as well as with France and Russia) by which the Italians&apos; should put at our disposal a certain amount of gold as a condition- of the grant of further war loans by this country. The actual amount of gold deposited under these arrangements by the Italian Government was  22,200,000, against which we made advances to a total of  182 millions. Later in the war, we made many further advances without claiming any additional gold as security. In the 1915 Agreement it was provided that the Italian Government should not be entitled to claim the return of their gold until after the repayment of the advances we had made at the same time, and in 1921 the Italian Government agreed that the gold should be regarded as a set-off against the total amount of the Italian Governments indebtedness to the British Government. The whole arrangement by which the Italians had a nominal claim to the repayment of this gold was in reality pure window-dressing, as obviously the Italians had no need of British loans so long as they had gold available for export, and we had always regarded the Italian debt as the net amount of our advances to Italy after deducting the gold they had deposited with us and which we had used towards our gold shipments to America. In view of the fact that under the Italian Debt Settlement the Italians were only to pay about one-eighth of the amount of their debts, and the rest was to be written off, it wrould have been only natural to write off the Italian claim for gold, and this we accordingly proposed. The Italian Delegation, however, pleaded that any such arrangement would have serious effects on their credit, as this gold deposit still figured as security for the note issues made by the Bank of Italy, and, finally, it was agreed that the Italians should pay slightly more than the  4 millions a year originally proposed and that the additional payments should be used to redeem the gold deposit by instalments. So far as we are concerned, we should have preferred to wipe out this claim and counterclaim altogether. But now, under the Experts&apos; proposal, the amounts which Italy will pay in order to repurchase the gold are treated as a deadweight debt liability by Italy, similar to our payments to America, and the amounts are to be provided out of the German Annuities, so that, in fact, Italy is to get back this gold without any cost. On the other hand, we who during and after the War exported about  200 millions of gold to America out of our own resources (exclusive of  120 millions borrowed from France, Russia and Italy) are to receive nothing under this head, and we are to supply Italy not merely with her gold but with nearly  2 millions a year of Reparations in addition.(4.) Italian Deliveries in Kind. The proposal that this country should make these concessions to Italy is peculiarly difficult to understand, considering the use which the Italian Government have made of their Reparation Receipts. Despite repeated representations by the British Government, the Italians have taken practically the whole of their payments from Germany in the form of Reparation coal, with the result that the normal volume of British coal exports to Italy-particularly from South Wales have been correspondingly diminished. This situation is not in accordance with the original intentions of the Peace Treaty, where it was stipulated (with a view to safeguarding our coal trade) that at least two-thirds of the coal deliveries to Italy should be &quot;land-borne&quot; and not &quot;sea-borne.&quot; The object of this was to compel the Italians if they took German coal to pay the heavy cost of transport over Switzerland. But the Italians got round the Treaty stipulation by arguing that coal could only be considered &quot;sea-borne &quot; if it were shipped direct from a German port; and that if it crossed the German frontier by land, was shipped from Rotterdam and Antwerp the natural ports of the Ruhr-it must be considered &quot;land-borne.&quot; This interpretation obviously made the stipulation meaningless, but we have never been able to get it overruled, with the result that ever since 1921 the Italians have taken their coal mainly by sea. The Dawes Plan made it even more difficult to oppose these arrangements, as deliveries in kind were encouraged under the Plan, and the Creditor Powers were given special facilities for that purpose. As a result the Italians have constantly increased their coal orders from Germany as the Dawes Annuities increased, and the remonstrances we have from time to time made have been completely ignored.   There is little doubt
that the reparation deliveries reduce our coal exports to Italy by about 4 million tons a year, and the only way to restore the Italian market to the Welsh coal exporters is by reducing the share of Reparations which Italy has at her disposal. The proposals of the Experts, therefore, are in this respect diametrically opposite to the objective which we have in view. (It is true that under the Young Report deliveries in kind arerto be reduced, and to be abolished after 10 years; but if the Italian share of the Annuities were smaller, their share of deliveries in kind would be propor-tionately smaller. And if transfers are postponed, the whole Italian share may be taken in deliveries, and a special agreement providing for coal deliveries up to  4 millions a year, in the event of the postponement of transfers, was made between the Italian and German experts.)(5.) General Political Considerations. Finally, there are no wider political considerations which would lend colour to the Italian claims; on the contrary, any proposal to give them special favours must inevitably provoke awkward repercussions elsewhere. For example, relations have for long been strained between Italy and Serbia. Nowr Serbia is entitled to 5 per cent, of Reparations, i.e., exactly one-half of what Italy is entitled to. Yet the Experts propose that during the first 37 years Serbia should get the equivalent of an equated annuity of an average  4,200,000 a year, whereas Italy is to get  10,700,000; and that during the subsequent 22 years Serbia is to get  1,130,000 a year, and Italy is to get  17 millions a year. Is a proposal of this kind likely to be regarded by Serbia as reasonable or fair ?So far from meriting any special concessions, Italy deserves no support. During recent years she has on many occasions placed every possible obstruction in the way of proposals for facilitating the further reconstruction of eastern Europe. For example, two years ago the Austrian Government arrived at a settlement with us of the Austrian Relief Debts on terms which have since been accepted by the United States of America (as well as by France and the neutral Powers). Their object was to raise a loan for the development of their Railways, but the project has been completely held up by the Italian Government, which has refused to accept the same terms as the other Powers for the settlement of the Austrian Relief Debt to Italy, and, until the Italian consent is obtained, the Austrian Government are precluded from proceeding with the loan negotiations. Similarly, a long time ago the British and French Treasuries arrived at a tentative scheme for the settlement of all the outstanding liabilities due by the so-called Succession States, viz., Serbia, Roumania, Czecho-Slovakia and Poland, in respect of properties ceded to them under the Treaties with Austria and Hungary. These proposals included the write-off of the theoretical obligations of these States which there is no prospect of ever recovering, but which, so long as they existed, will hamper the economic recovery of these countries and lead to excessive demands for reparations from Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria. The Franco-British proposals were put before the Italian Government more than two years ago, but by one pretext or another the Italian Government have evaded any discussion of them and are still doing so, and during the Experts Meetings the Italian representatives have been peculiarly intransigent in maintaining their claims on these Balkan States.
