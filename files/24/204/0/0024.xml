hi hi AA&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT,SECRET.       ^ COPY NO.    24CP.176(29).CAB I N E T.THE british COAL INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the President of the Board ofTrade.
299hi the British Co^l Industry.The attached memorandum,submitted by the Secretary for Mines, attempts to set out in some detail the. present e-eonomic position, and offers some comments on the future prospects of the coal industry of this country.The first chapter contains the essential figures of output, exports, employment, regularity of work and financial results - and also draws attention to the surplus of actual capacity for production over demand as the root cause of the long period of depression.      Until this industry has gone through the process of &quot;pruning&quot; to which most of the other major industries have been subjected since the war, it cannot, he suggests, secure a solid foundation on which to build.The memorandum proceeds to describe what has been done and what is being attempted to reorganise and &quot;rationalise&quot; by amalgamation and by schemes for regulating the production and sale of coal.     This is followed by a short note on the effect of railway freight reliefs on -coal under the scheme of derating of productive industry.      Subsequent chapters deal with the position of the wages agreements, the immediate situation that would arise, and the probable effect on employment of a reduction in the working hours in mines.These subjects may be regarded as those of immediate interest to the economic health of the industry.     In another category are questions which may have a considerable and important bearing on the future of the industry, but are unlikely immediately to affect it appreciably.     A consideration of these is therefore not included In the present memorandum.     They include the effect upon our trade of reparation coal deliveries and the improved prospects under the &quot;Young&quot; Plan;    the use of pulverised fuel in marine boilers;    the progress that is being made

The present position of the Coal Mining. Indus try.In &amp; report recently issued by the Coal Committee of the Economic Committee of the League of Nations it Is pointed out that the great disequilibrium between demand and immediately available productive capacity is the cause and measure of the problem.For Great Britain it is estimated that the productive capacity of existing mines with their present equipment is some-where in the neighbourhood of 330 million tons per annum.   The actual output during the last four years has been -1925 1926(National Dispute of 7 months)192719281929(On the basis of the first five months)243 million tons126251 238 258&quot;     .      &quot;       It is very doubtful whether the rate of the first five months will be maintained.Too many mines are still at work, at a loss, in the hope that prioes will improve or costs fall still further but their mere existence prevents those rises in price and falls in costs which would permit good wages to be paid and profits made * During   recent years a series of unexpected happenings has kept in being uneconomic pits whLbh should have been closed down* During the control period the losses incurred were reimbursed by the State.     Subsequently the occupation of the Ruhr, disputes involving a cessation of coal production on the Continent i in America and at home created an artificial price and enabled uneconomic pits to carry on.     There were indications in 1928 that many pits had roached the limit of their resources and were being forced into liquidation.     Tho Improvement in trade towards the end of the year, accelerated by the severe woather conditions in February and March, once again stemmed the tide
2    jof depression for the time being, prevented mines from closing down and caused others to be re-opened.      If tho uneconomic p:.ts could be closed down and their trade transferred to  the more up-to-date and profitable ones,   and increased efficiency secured by judicious  amalgamation, the 250 to 260 million tons of coal per annum required to meet the present home and export demand could, it is believed,be produced and sold at present prices without loss.Tho process would of course, be a severe one.      Colliery owners, shareholders in colliery undertakings and banks  would lose hoavily,  and distress would result locally from the redistribution and concentration of tho Industry with a consequent alteration of the incidence of employment as well as an actual reduction in the amount of employment.      It is estimated that 850,000 miners working full time would produce an output of&apos; 250 million tons, and for every variation up or down of 10 million, tons of output 34,000 men would be absorbed or added to the surplus labour.The following notes give in some detail the present state of output, exports, pithead costs, proceeds and profits, home consumption and employment in the first part cf 1929 as compared with the results of recent years.     Generally speaking the year 1926 is&apos; omitted on account of the National Stoppage of that year.The results in the coal mining industry in 1928 were very disappointing.      But towards the latter part of the year there wore distinct signs of improvement both as regards volume of trade and price, and this improvement continued during the first three or four months of 1929.     Signs of some falling away are-, however, again making, themselves apparent, but general opinion is that some permanent advantage will remain.     The industry appears in fact to have shown a small but definite and continuing improve-ment since the early autumn of last year.
Output.During the first 5 months of 1929, the total output was 107il- million tons,  which is slightly below the corresponding figure in 1927 (which was affected by the heavy demands following the Stoppage of 1926) but better than in either 1925 or 1928, the increase over 1928 being 5k million tons.      The output in May 1929 was, for the weeks not affected by holidays, rather over 5 million tons a week or at a better level than in 1925 or 1928. Exports .The amount of coal exported in the first 5 months of 1929   was 2l- million tons in excess of 1928 and about f million tons in excess of 1925.     There is   at present no sign of a falling away in tonnage. In fact, the figures for the past three months  (March, April and May) are better than any of the corresponding periods in 1925, 1927 or 1928. Export Values.In the period October 1927 to May 1928, the average f.o.b., value of coal  exported fell from 16/9 to 15/7, but in the period October 1928 to April 1929 there was an improvement from 15/8 to 16/3.      For May the figure fell to.16/1. Pithead Costs, Proceeds and Profits.The average pithead proceeds of all coal commercially disposable have improved as compared with last year, and for March, 1929, when the figure was 14/2 a ton, it was higher than for any month since September 1927.      In September 1928 the figure was 13/2, so that during the seven months ended March 1929 there was an improvement of l/- a ton.      The figure for April was, however, 4d a ton lower at 13/10.While proceeds had Improved, costs had been reduced,   and during the months January to April there was, for the first time for a considerable period, a credit balance for the industry as a whole. In January the balance was 7d. a ton, in February 9d. in March lOd. but in April the figure had fallen to  2d., the drop of 8d. being equally divided between an increase in costs and a lowering of proceeds,
Employment.During the spring of 1927/ the post stoppage rush of orders caused employment in mines to increase until a peak fl/rure of 1,030 ,-eOO was reached in the middle of Hay.      Thereafter a steady and persistent decline occurred In the numbers employed until low water mark of 897,000 was reached in August 1928, after which the position remained stabilised round the 900,000 mark until the beginning of this year.      This spring the numbers increased to nearly 940,000 at which fifruro the position appears arain to have become temporarily stabilised.In spite of an increased number of employees, the pits have worked more regularly this year,  the number of days on which the pits wound coal averaging over 5 days a week during the months January-April.     May, however, shows a drop to just over 4l days, but the level is still higher than that of last year.     The number of persons wholly unemplo3red and those on short time working, published by the Ministry of Labour, were,except for January, substantially lower than the corresponding numbers for last year. For May 1929 the figures were 127,486 wholly unemployed and 71,677 on short time, as compared with 161,300 and 84,290 respectively in May 1928.Since January 1929 there has been a continuous fall in the numbers totally unemployed from 171,162 to 127,486, but since March the numbers temporarily unemployed have rsion from 12,758 to 84,290, thus - indicating a considerable increase in short time.working. Home Consumption.The increase in output as compared with tho first fivo months of 1928 was mainly due to a higher rate of export, and there has been little improvement in the amount of coal retained for home consumption.The improvement in the coal trade in the earlier months of the year, while encouraging, was due to a larpe extent to seasonal
causes and to the extraordinary dislocation of foreign coal supplies occasioned by the abnormal frost.      The export trade may retain some of the benefit which this freak of nature provided, but there is no sign of any improvement in the home demand which would hold out a hope of the trade maintaining substantially the improved level set by the first part of this year.The following figures give particulars for the years 1911-13, 1913, 1925, 1927, 1928 and for the first 5 months of 1925, 1927, 1928 and 1929.Output of Coal,     Export of Coal.

20 9AMALGAMAT ION    OP    COLLIERY    UNDERTAKINGS.Since  the passing of the Mining Industry Act, 1926, and up to  the end cf May, 1929, amalgamation schemes affecting 198 pits, normally employing about 149,000 workpeople, had been completed.      At first comprising 19 groups, this number was subsequently reduced to 16 by further amalgamation of the South Wales anthracite groups. Details of these amalgamations are given in the Report by the Board of Trade under Section 12 on the working of Fart I. of the Mining Industry Act, 1926,    presented to Parliament in November, 1928.-
9-9 A hj &amp;3ELLINC- SCHEMES IK THE GOAL INDUSTRY.One of the important features in the coal industry in the year 19 28 was the inauguration of various schemes devise1 to secure greater co-operation within the industry.The first scheme of this character to be put into operation was that introduced by the Scottish coal owners on 6th March,  1928.      This scheme provided for:-(a) a general levy not exceeding 6d. per ton on coal sold for inland purposes, excluding coal sold to ancillaryor associated undertakings and coal for colliery consumption;(b) a special levy on coal for certain classes of consumers (o.g., public utility undertakings);and (c) the payment of compensation to collieries  (out of funds raised by the general and special levies) on an agreed basis in respect of suspension or curtailment of potential output-capacity by closing a colliery or seam or section of a seam or by other- means. The scheme covered approximately 90% of the Scottish output and its principal object was to concentrate,  in those pits which could best afford to trade under current conditions, the production of such amount of coal as the market was estimated to be able to absorb.Compensation for the curtailment of output was paid during the year that the scheme was in operation, resulting in the displacement of about 10,000 workers,  it being claimed by the owners that but for the working of the scheme, the depression of the trade would have caused greater Linemployment.Except in so far as the scheme reduced costs,  it did nothing for the export trade, and early this year,  an alternative scheme was discussed by the Scottish coal masters
which abandoned the system of compensation for curtailment of outpujt, and substituted for it a more elaborate arrangement which provided for:-- (a) the regulation of output by fixing basic tonnages andapplying periodically percentage quotas to them;(b) financial assistance to exports provided out of fundsraised by levies on inland sales; and (c ) consideration to be given to co-operative action in fixing from time to time the contract price of coal to public Utility Works or Services.The Scheme was not to be operative until not less than 90% (on an output basis) of the Scottish coal owners generally, and in each of the four Scottish Districts accepted it.Acceptances of the scheme were invited in the early months of 1929 when trade was good, and the support from Lanarkshire was very poor,  although the necessary percentages were secured in the other districts,      In the meantime the original Scottish Scheme had lapsed,  so that no co-operative arrangement is now in force in Scotland.      Endeavours have, however,  continued to secure the requisite percentage in Lanarkshire and it is now reported that about 63% of the owners in that district are prepared to support the scheme.      The promoters of the scheme are still hopeful that It will be possible to introduce it in the near future.The second scheme to be introduced in 1928 was that covering the Midland Coalfields, and it came into operation at the beginning of April, 19 28.      Originally it was intended to cover the Yorkshire, Notts.,  and Derby Coalfields, but it subsequently embraced, in addition to those districts, the districts of Lancashire, Cheshire, North Staffordshire, Cannock Chase, Leicestershire and Warwickshire.      The members collectively have
hi ts i)formed what is termed the Central Collieries Commercial MAssociation.This scheme provided for:-(a) a levy not exceeding 3d. per ton on all coal raised;(b) a regulation of output as follows:-(i) a basic tonnage for each member to be determined in the first instance by reference to the output in any year of the 15 years ended 31st December, 1927,  selected by him;(ii) a quota (or percentage) applied each month (in advance) to the basic tonnage so arrived at;(c) imposition of penalties for exceeding the quota (if a member exceeds his quota in any month by more than 1% he is liable to a fine of 3/- per ton in respect of the excess tonnage, and in the case of systematic excesses heavier penalties may be applied);(d) financial assistance out of the funds raise! by the levy and by fines, to be given to coal for export and foreign bunkers, arrangements being made that this assistance does not operate for the benefit of intermediaries;    and(e) the establishment of a Shipping Bureau to watch the members&apos;  interests In the export markets.It is claimed that about 90% of the output of the coalfields to which the scheme applied Is covered by it and that it controls an output of over 100,000,000 tons a year.The object of this scheme was twofold.      It proposed to deal with over-production, first, by expanding the Humber export market by means of assisted export prices, the financial provision for this being met from the levy on all coal raised in the coalfields covered by the scheme;    and, second, by regulating output by means of the quota system.
hi       (jSo far financial assistance has been given to exports only and^not to foreign bunkers.      The exports from the Humber have certainly increased substantially since the scheme has operated, but whether at the expense of the foreign producer, or other British coalfields is difficult to say.      The foreign bunker position on the Humber has been difficult at times, owing to the tendency of coal for shipment to go as cargo at a lower f.o.b. price,  and special steps have had to be taken on occasion by the Central Collieries Commercial Association to make supplies of coal available as bunkers.,During 1928,  some difficulty was experienced owing to the method of fixing  &apos;basic 1 tonnages,  which obviously favoured the older collieries at the expense of those recently developed. To meet this, basic tonnages were revised from 1st January, 1929, to bring them more into accord with the present capacity of the pits.      Thus the South Yorkshire - coalfield, with its modern pits, received, on the whole, a higher basic tonnage; and Lancashire and Cheshire,  a much older coalfield, received a lower one.Discussions have been taking place among the members of the Central Collieries Commercial Association with regard to schemes for controlling prices and for regulating the carrying forward from month to month of tonnages within the quota but, not raised owing to slack trade.      No decision on these matters has yet been taken.Discussions also proceeded at intervals throughout 1928 in South Wales with regard to the formation of a district scheme.      The original proposal provided for:-(a) a levy of not more than 3d. per ton on all coalraised in South Wales;(b) grouping of coals and the fixing of minimum prices for each group;.
(c) compensation- at the rate of not more than 2/- per ton in respect of shifts lost through want of trade owing to the operation of the minimum prices, and(d) fines at the rate of 2/- per ton for sales at prices below the minimum.The object of the scheme in this coalfield was to increaseproceeds without any definite regulation of output and withoutnecessarily closing down pits, but it was not found possible tointroduce the scheme.      Prom the beginning of May a system of minimum prices: in the steam coal trade was Introduced and thisis still in force. &quot;  At the beginning of 1929 when tradeimproved, prices rose, and since minimum prices were not raised the voluntary scheme was virtually non-existentPrices arenow, however,  on the-down grade,   and the minimum prices havebeen Increased by Sd. per ton,  so that the voluntary scheme isnow operating again.Towards the end of 1928 an attempt was made to introduce in South Wales a scheme of regulation of output by means of basic tonnages and quotas,      This scheme provided forpenalties in the case of excess production, the penaltiesforming a fund out of which those pits producing less than their quota could be compensated.      The scheme made no provision for subsidising exports,      It has not yet receivedsufficient support for It to be Introduced.tj^lz Although consideration has been given in these districtsflandB &apos;   to co-operation In selling,  all that has been actually doneham.is for the industry to agree to minimum prices for export business.      This system was in force for the greater part of 1928 and still continues.
hJ O kjIn each of these schemes the unit is a defined area considerable in size.     The indications are that it may be only a step towards some scheme of co-operation on a still wider basis.    Meetings have been held at the Mining Association, at which it has already been agreed in principle that the various districts should consult together as to ways and means of bringing about co-operation not only between individual collieries in the  same district, but also between the districts themselves.     These discussions are still proceeding, particularly with regard to the position of the exporting districts.It would be unsafe to attempt to assess the results of these schemes.     They rest on different bases;    they are in some respects obviously experimental;    and their period of operation has been comparatively short.    It is perhaps sufficient to say that their adoption alone is an indication of a remarkable change in an industry which as recently as 1926, through its accredited representatives on the Lewis Committee on co-operative selling, whole-heartedly condemned the suggestion that organised marketing in the coal industry was necessary or desirable.
Scheme of derating of productive industry.Under the scheme for adjusting the existing relationships between national and local finance, it was intended that all productive industry should he relieved of three quarters of amounts ordinarily payable as local rates.     The railways participated in the scheme as from 1st December, 1928, on the understanding that the relief they obtained would be used for lowering railway freights on certain selected traffics, including coal,  coke and patent fuel,upon which the burden of high railway freights had fallen heavily.     Following representations made by the industry, the relief to be accorded to coal was concentrated on coal, coke and patent fuel passing over the public railways for shipment overseas   (including that used for foreign bunkers and bunkers for fishing vessels) end coal, coke and patent fuel for iron and steel works.      s from 1st December, 1923, a rebate of 1-gd. per ton plus 25% of the remainder of the carriage charges was granted.      It was estimated to be equal to 76V. a ton on the average on coal exported and lOd. a ton on coal for iron and steel works.      The average amount of rebate actually paid during the four months ended March,  1929, based on provisional returns, was 7.53d. per ton in the case of exported coal and 9.29d. per ton on coal for iron and steel works.In addition a rebate of 10/&apos;- of the carriage charges was granted on mining timber and on iron and steel used for propping or shoring purposes in mines.
I 1-18WAGES AGREEMENTSAfter the dispute of 1926 separate wage agreements were made inxeach district.In broad principle they ..all followed the precedent of the national agreements of 1921 and 1924, in that they provided for(a) the determination from time to time of a percentage addition to basis rates, by reference either to the net proceeds realised in the district (the &quot;economic percentage&quot;) or to a prescribed minimum figure  (the &quot;minimum percentage&quot;) whichever was the greater;(b) the determination of special additional allowances for the lower grades to provide a minimum inclusive sum below which wages at basis plus percentage should not fall.Even under the National Agreements of 1921 and 1924 these principles were applied by districts, with the result that one district might be on an &quot;economic percentage&quot; while another was on a &quot;minimum percentage&quot;, subsistence rates were to b? fixed for the different districts independently of one another- and&apos; the cash values of wages even at the minimum percentages slso varied. There was however an appearance of uniformity in the fact that not -..&apos;--ly were the principles contained in 9 single document of&apos; &quot;national&quot;  scope, but also that the share of proceeds to be allocated to wages   (when they rose above the minimum) was uniform for all districts, and that the minimum percentage- everywhere was determined by the same calculation, that is to say, it was to provide as a minimum a level of wages which was equivalent   (at least nominally) to 2 0$, in the 1921 agreement, or 33 in the1924 agreement, above the level of 1914 - called &quot;Standard&quot; .The main practical difference introduced by the district agreements of 1926 and 1927 was that the last mentioned figure
was left to district settlement, end that this  (and with it &quot;subsistence rates&quot;) was reduced below the 33 V5 C1&quot; the 1924 agreement and varied district by district.*    Another difference was that the share of proceeds to be allocated to wages   (above the minimum percentage) was also left for district settlement and was variously fixed.      But this has been of no practical importance as only one district  (apart from Somerset - very small) has risen above the minimum during the currency of the agreements.Another point of more practical interest is that the agreements are terminable  (by notice) at different dates.Appended is a  list of the larger districts showing what are their minimum percentages - reduced to a common basis, viz:  above their 1914 rates or &quot;standard&quot;:    - the average earnings per shift of all. classes with wages at the minimum;    the dates on which the agreements are terminable;    and the profit or loss at which the districts have been working during recent quarters: -Profit or LossMinimum Average% above earn-&quot;-stan- ings-&quot;-dard&quot;tlandthumberland ham Wales ks . ts.

It will be seen that the agreements of such important districts as Scotland, Northumberland, Durham, South Wales, Yorkshire and Lancashire are all terminable about the end of this year.There is little as yet to enable one to estimate what will be the attitude of the owners towards these agreements.      It is sufficiently clear that in most districts the industry is unable to make a profit in present conditions and that the owners therefore would like, if it were practicable, to get wages reduced.      The probability, however, Is that, If hours of work remain unaltered, the owners in most districts, if not in all, will be prepared to let the existing agreements also run on without change - that Is to say that they will not for their part give notice to terminate them or t,o amend them in any material respect.If hours are reduced the whole economic situation of the industry will become involved.     The immediate situation which is likely to follow is discussed below.      It is sufficient here to say that the wages agreements will necessarily go into the &quot;melting pot&quot; , with the owners declaring that the present agreements have become economically Impossible.Another possibility which has to be faced is the demand of the Miners&apos; Federation for a return to a national agreement,, and possibly for a new Minimum Wage Act .It has already been stated that a national agreement in the past has meant, in substance, a nationally determined minimum percentage on the &quot;standard&quot; rates of each district. This is as difficult now as it was in 1925 and 1926.      It will be seen for example that at present Northumberland has a minimum percentage of minus seven and is making a loss on it, whilst Warwickshire has a percentage of plus 30 end on the average is making a profit on it,     A &quot;national&quot; figure, common
to all districts, could not fail to be either so high as practically to kill Northumberland or else so low as to be quite inadequate for Warwickshire,It is true that there are as great anomalies of this kind within districts as there are between districts.    In Warwickshire itself, which on the average is working at a substantial profit, there are a number of pits which are in such difficulty that they have given notice that they cannot continue at the present rate of wages.    The adverse results of these collieries tend to reduce pro tanto the wages payable by the profitable collieries.    The profits of the latter directly or indirectly fix the wages at a level &quot;which the former cannot pay.      Some adjustment as between pit and pit can be made by variations of basis rates, particularly of the piece-work prices, but such great divergencies in profitability still remain as to make the whole question even of any district uniformity, not to speak of national,  one of special difficulty in this industry.It is impossible to fix a uniform rate for a district which is even approximately right for all pits in it;    it is always lower than some pits could afford and high enough to force others out of existence.      It has the advantage of rewarding, and there-fore of encouraging, efficiency, but it may be a serious matter for the mining community which is dependent upon the less profitable units,  and it becomes a serious matter indeed    if, by a national application of the principle of uniformity,  a large part of a whole district is &quot;sent to the wall&quot;.      It is difficult to foretell how much of Northumberland or Durham for instance could survive if by a national agreement they were compelled to pay a minimum of 20$ on &quot;standard&quot;.The possible demand for a new minimum wage act is more difficult to discuss, because it is not known what form of act
\might be demanded.    The existing Act provides for the establishment and maintenance of joint Boards in each district with an independent chairman, with power to fix minimum rates for each class of underground workmen and to make rules applicable thereto.      These Boards have power also to revise their rates from time to time,  subject always to this viz: that under the Act the rates must be fixed by reference to rates actually being paid;    in other words the Act has always been interpreted as preventing a Board from fixing, minimum rates at a higher level than the actual rates generally current at the time.The demand might be to remove this condition and to allow the Boards actually to raise the rates generally being paid at any time.    This would alter the original character of the Act which was primarily to give a piece-worker a guarantee of some minimum payment provided that he worked properly,  and secondarily to raise the day work rates at lower-rated collieries up to or nearer to the rates generally current in the district.    Another objection which might be raised to it would be that it would enable the Joint Board (which usually means the independent chairman) in effect to override the district agreement.    Broadly, however,  it would mean little more than a system of compulsory arbitration on wages ratescAnother form which the demand might take would be for an Act which itself named the minimum sum payable either to any man,  or to each class of men,  either nationally or in each district.      No wages legislation has ever yet taken .. this form,  and the objections to it in principle and the difficulties of it in practice may probably be regarded as ruling it out as a practical possibility.
THE  IMMEDlATE SITUATION. The question of hours is presumably the one to which the Miners&apos; Federation will attach most Importance in the immediate future.It is well known that the miners wish hours to be reduced.The existing Act has two more years to run.      After Oth July, 1931, in the absence of any further legislation, the 1926 Act expires and   hours revert to a maximum of 7    (-exclusive of winding time) under the 1919 Act.Any action taken before that date might fall under one of two heads:-    one merely to anticipate the date at which the 1926 Act expir s,  the other to introduce some new maximum different both from the 1919 -Act and from the 192C Act.It must probably be anticipated that any reduction in hours, whether by the one moans or by the other, will lead to a serious crisis in the industry.Assuming, first, that the 1926 Act were repealed, the first step of the owners would be to declare that all wages agreements were ioso facto at an end, and to give notice in districts of the wages which they were prepared to offer for the shorter hours.    It would, in fact, be a repetition of 1925 and 1926, with the difference that prices nowadays are lower than they were in the spring of 1925 or even of 1926, and the wages offers would, if anything, be lower than they Fere  then.      In some districts the wages offered on a 7-hour day would be very low Indeed - so low that the owners might even elect to make no offer but merely to say that they could not open their pits at all on a 7-hour day.     But in any case the men would refuse the offers made and the pits would be shut, as in 1926.The miners might press for a Minimum Wage Act to supersede the owners&apos; wages offers.     What kind of Act could bo Introduced?
Parliament has never yet passed any wages legislation which specified the amount to he paid;    it has never done more than establish machinery whereby an industry itself, with some independent &quot;leavening&quot;, should fix its own minimum wages, and, apart from the Miners1 Minimum Wage Act of 1912, it has done this only for trades where the Trade Union was weak or non-existent.     But whatever form the Act might take - whether the Act itself fixed the rates, or whether it left it to some other body to do so, and whether it fixed one minimum or various minima, according to districts or according to grades - it could do no more than provide that, if any pit worked,  it must pay the rates prescribed.      It could not make any pit work, and though a few might work for the sake of reaping the harvest of the famine prices, substantially nothing would have been done - or could b- done - to set the industry at work again as an economic possibility.      The situation would be the situation of 1926.     What the solution of it would be or when it would come about is almost  -beyond the bounds even of conjecture-.Any other legislation which in fact resulted in reduction of hours would probably also be followed by notices to reduce wages, with similar results to those sketched above.The ratification of the Washington Convention, therefore, is a matter of vital interest to the coal mining industry in present conditions.      Precisely what the application of the Convention to the coal mining industry should be is a question of some doubt, or at least argument.      What is the definition of &quot;work&quot; in this industry?     Does it include, for instance, the getting to and from work underground?      In calculating the period of work, may deductions be made for travelling time, waiting &quot;t,ime, snap time, etc.?      Is the 8- hours calculable for each individual man or for- the whole shift? -   If winding times
are included, irniat it be the winding time of each separate pit? Or may it bo the average for a district or for the county? There is room for much discussion and disagreement on questions  of interpretation.      But if the interpretation ultimately adopted results in a reduction in working time th re is little doubt but that a crisis will follow.The situation might be different if the labour conditions -including hours, wages, and all other matters which are properly included in the term - were generally of as high a standard in other European coal mines as they are in Great Britain.      For that reason, Great Britain has every reason to hope that the inquiries and negotiations now being undertaken by the Inter-national labour Office referred to later may result in general labour conditions in competitive European countries being brought nearer&apos; to equality with our own.      But until this  is done, any addition to our own costs of production is bound to be the cause of the gravest difficulties.The slightest hint of possible labour troubles in the mine-fields will be sufficient to do extensive damage to our export trade.      North European countries, after their experience of last winter, are shy of relying too fully on Poland and Germany for next winter&apos;s stocks and are showing an inclination to make larger purchases In this country.      Any suggestion that supplies may not be forthcoming from this country next winter will again turn the scale in favour of Poland and Germany.
Probable effect on employment.The Act of 1926 resulted in an additional hour being worked in some^, districts , and an additional half-hour in the others.Underground hours to-day, excluding winding times, are 7-g- in Yorkshire, Nottingham and North Derby and Kent, representing about 30 per cent, of the total output, 7-1 for hewers in Northumberland and Durham, and 8 elsewhere.      (In many districts there is a short shift on Saturdays, and in Northumberland and Durham, and parts of Scotland, every alternate Saturday is an &quot;idle&quot; day.)The increase in hours is estimated to have increased the effective working time at the face in a full day from an average of about 5 hours 45 minutes, to an average of about 6 hours 35 minutes, an increase of one-seventh.      Similarly, a return to the previous hours would require an increase of roughly one-seventhin man-power to produce the same output.On the other hand, the longer hours have been accompanied bya reduction in costs, a substantial part of which has been due to the mere increase in hours independently of any other cause.     As compared with 1925, the average costs of production over the coalfields as a whole have dropped by 3/6 or more per ton. Of this, about l/2 per ton is estimated to have been due to reductions in district wages percentages, and the balance to other causes (including railway freight relief).      It is safe to attribute at least l/S of the latter to the Increase in hours alone.Nor should it be forgotten that this is an average figure. It varies district by district.      It is about 3/- in South Wales, 1/lOd. in Northumberland and Durham, l/6d. in Scotland, l/- in Lancashire, Cheshire and North Staffordshire, and an average of about 8d. in the Eastern Group of Districts (less in Yorkshire, Notts, and North Derby, which are 7-g- hour districts, and more in Leicester, South Derby, Warwick and Cannook, which are on 8 hours).
Other things being equal, therefore, a return to previous hours would mean e very serious increase in costs,  particularly in certain districts.To estimate the effect on employment of a repeal of the1926 Act, it is necessary to try to weigh the larger amount oflabour required to produce a given output against the effect on output of an increase in the costs of production.    In other words,the first question is what loss of business would have to beexpected.    That the industry cannot, in present conditions,itself bear the Increased costs Is sufficiently clear from a survey of the quarterly statistics for the past two years, viz:June quarter, 1927, average of 1/1 loss-September &quot;         &quot; &quot; &quot; l/2 &quot;December   &quot;         &quot; &quot; &quot; l/- &quot;March         &quot; 1928, -   &quot; &quot; 9d. &quot;June          11 -&quot; &quot; &quot;1/5 &quot;September &quot;         &quot; -   &quot; &quot; 1/4 &quot;December   &quot;          &quot; &quot; .       11 3d. &quot;March         &quot; 1929, &quot; &quot; 9d. profitApril         &quot;         &quot; &quot; &quot; 2d. &quot;Except during recent months, the industry has been workingconsistently at a loss, and even the better results of recent months have been due mainly to temporary causes which are alreadypast, particularly in the inland districts.    At the present time,indeed,  output is back to the same weekly rate as it was a yearago.   The best feature of the present situation is that exportsstill remain at a higher figure than they were last year, andare realising an average of about 6d. per ton more, but,  over a 11,the industry is barely making both ends meet, and the additions to costs, which would result from the repeal of the 1926 Act,would, therefore, be a serious matter.    In South Wales, forexample, It would mean an average loss of about 3/- per ton,unless prices could be increased without loss of business, inScotland nearly 2/- per ton, and an average loss of about 1/ 6per ton for the coalfields as a whole.    So far as can beestimated from figures at present available, there is only onedistrict, viz., Warwickshire, which in present conditions,  could
bear the increase and continue to make a reasonable profit on the capital invested.    All other districts not only could not bear the increased costs, but,  in fact, are already without a reasonable profit, or, indeed, any profit.     Nor can it be expected that pits will continue to work at a loss to the same extent as they have done in the past.   There were clear -indications during 1928 that the limits of collieries&apos; resources in that respect were rapidly being reached.    There was a marked increase in the rate of closing of &quot;uneconomic&quot; pits during 1928, and the temporary improvement of the last few months will not in itself have been either large enough or long enough to make much difference.   According to present, indications, there is a prospect of the closing of pits being resumed again before long, even without any alteration in hours.    This is not to say that the total output, or the total volume of employment (at any rate in terms of full-time employment) is likely to fall below the 1928 figures so long as present conditions continue.    It is rather to say that the industry is having such difficulty in making ends meet in present conditions, that, if the present total output is to be maintains d, any increase in costs must, in one way or another, be &quot;passed on&quot;. Unless wages were to be further reduced -. and in some districts in particular this is morally impossible - prices would have to be Increased.    Can they be?    and what loss of business would result if they were?It is obviously not necessary that a uniform increase should be made in the price of all coals.    But if less is1 put on in one market, more must be put on in another.    If nothing is put on to export coal, more must be put on to inland coal.    If nothing is put on to coal for iron and steel, more must be put on to other inland coal.On the other hand, there is no &quot;pooling&quot; as between one undertaking and another, and many pits, e.g. generally in South Wales, have no other markets in which to recover any losses that they might make in the export markets, and it is clearly In the export markets which are open to foreign competition that the greatest danger lies.
In 1928, out of an output of 237 million tons, just over 50 million tons were exported, about 17 millions were shipped as foreign bunkers, and 164 million tons were retained for consumption at home, the balance being represented by coke and manufactured fuel exported.The bulk of the coal exports (42 million tons) went to Europe and the Mediterranean markets, where competition is most intense and consequently there is the greatest risk of loss of trade -following an increase in price.     In discussing the problem of the coal industry, the Economic Committee of the League of Nations pointed out that the great dis-equilibrium between demand and immediately available productive capacity was the cause and measure of the problem.     Under these conditions even a slight proportionate excess of production over demand tends to depress prices below a remunerative level.      Conversely, even a small increase in quotations by one of the competitive countries is likely to be enough to lose the business to other countries which are not at present producing to full capacity, provided only that they have the necessary transport facilities, etc,,, with which to market it.Our chief competitors in Europe and the Mediterranean markets are Germany and Poland.      The latter country seised the opportunity of 1926 to extend and consolidate its position in British markets, and by a system of low prices has maintained its hold on these markets.      It Is not producing to capacity, but although its exports have risen from 8 million tons in 1925 to 12 millions in 1928, its capacity to export overseas is still limited by its railway system and shipping facilities.      It is possible that by next year a new railway line from the pits to Dantzig and Gdynia will be open, and this, coupled with the increasing capacity of the port of Gdynia, now in process of development, will much increase her ability to handle coal shipments.     There is little doubt, in short, that any material increase in the proportionate level of British prices would present an   opportunity for Poland which she would be anxious and able to seize.     The German facilities for export even now are not taxed to capacity, and her
productive capacitv is about one quarter greater than her present output.      Other European producers, Prance, Belgium, Holland, are all ready to expand their production if they can readily compete against foreign coal.      And threats of Russian competition would probably be renewed if prices rose to any extent.Turning to the South American trade, where our exports in 1928 were 5 million tons, the chief threat of competition is from the United States and Germany, and, bearing in mind that the greater cart of the British exports to those markets came from South Wales, where the change of hours would probably increase costs by as much as 3/- per ton,  the presumption is that the loss of tonnage exported might be considerable. The average declared value of coal exported from Great Britain to South America decreased by nearly o/- per ton between 1925 and 1928.The inland, trade in some respects is subject to  the same kind of conditions as those which affect export business. Certain competitive trades such as, for instance, the iron and steel trades (which are customers for about 24 million tons ner annum) are subject to as keen a foreign competition as is the coal trade, itself, and any substantial increase in the price of coal to these trades would probably result in further loss of business to the foreigner.      In all, therefore, the field of special danger is as great as some 90 to 100, million tons a year.      The- remainder of the inland trade is in rather a different category,  in that, within reasonable limits, it Is subject only to &quot;internal&quot; competition, and no doubt a good deal of it, e.g., public utility undertakings, household coal, etc., could have increased prices imposed upon them without any greater difficulty than the protests which they would evoke.      But it is one thing to say that certain customers could bear increased prices:    it is another to &quot;hold&quot; those prices.      Internal competition is very keen;    existing district schemes of rationalisation are not enough to counter
9 % a ht tj !iit;    and in &quot;the circumstances now visualised the difficulties would be aggravated-      For one thing, some coal, which previously went abroad would lose its foreign market and swell the inland supply, and for another thing,  if any temporary success were achieved in raising home prices, more coal for this reason alone would be attracted to the Inland markets and depress the price again.     Even in the inland markets, therefore, some special steps would be required to achieve an increase in price-levels.What, it may be asked, were the level of prices and the volume of business under the 7-hour day when it was previously in force.The latest year during which the shorter hours were in force was 1925.     During the last five months of it the wages subvention was being paid.      During July business was stimulated by the treat of an early dispute.      During the first six months the average proceeds of all coal - inland and export - amounted to 18/9, 18/6, 18/3, 17/11, 17/5    and 16/10, and in the same months the tonnage was in round figures 22.5 million, 21, 22.5, 20, 20 and 17.5 (an average of 20.5 per month).      This is comparable with average proceeds of rather under 14/- at  the present time and average output at about 21 million tons per month.Export prices during the first six months of 1925 average 20/10 (falling from 2l/7 in January to 20/2 in June), and the tonnage exported was at the rate of 4.3 million per month. Recent export prices have averaged about 16/- per ton, and the monthly rate has been about 4,6 million tons.The conclusion might be drawn from this comparison that it makes very little difference to the tonnage exported whether the average price is 20/&apos;- or 16/-, and to the total tonnage raised whether the average proceeds are 18/- or 14/-.     There are, however, a number of points to be remembered, e.g.,  that the prices ruling at the beginning of 1925 could not be maintains but fell by an average of 2/- during the six months, and that
-32- 255even In June, when they had fallen to 16/10, representing an average loss of 2/- per ton, it was not possible to sell more than 17.5 million tons.      Costs ,to-day average 13/8 per ton, and with the shorter hours (and the same rates of wages) they would be about 15/2, and to yield an average profit of l/- per ton, proceeds would have to average 16/2, which is about 2/6 more than at present and not much short of the 16/10 of June, 1925. Another thing is that in 1925 Poland had not entered the lists as a competitor on anything like  the scale on which she competes to-day.      In order to meet that competition and recover our foreign business, our exporters had no option after 1926 but to cut prices.     This they did, and it was only a fen months ago that it was found possible to call a halt in the process, but it is very far from certain that, if our export prices were now raised to any appreciable extent, we should.not lose business. It is  true that prices in competitive foreign markets are unremunerative for all producing countries, and that all would welcome an increase.      But would our competitors follow us all the way?     Any increase being a &quot;profit&quot;, would they not prefer to secure some of our business for their own superfluous coal by utilising the opportunity of our advance in price to underbid us? A firm international arrangement could give us security in this respect, but this would not be a favourable opportunity for securing any satisfactory terms for Great Britain.It is true that looking at the industry as a whole, the total output would have to suffer a reduction of 30 millions or so before the total demand for labour on a &quot;7 hour&quot; day would be reduced.      But, as the industry is at present organised, it is necessary for practical purposes to consider the effect district by district, and almost pit by pit, and the conclusion to which, one is forced is that, though the demand for labour might not suffei , and indeed might actually increase, at pits trading in inland markets in which they could succeed in
increasing prices, the exporting districts would be faced with the necessity either of reducing wages still further - practically impossible, particularly in Northumberland and Durham - or of losing business and throwing further numbers of men out of work. There appears to be only one other possible alternative,  and that is for such a drastic alteration to be brought about in the organisation of the industry as would enable the losses incurred in maintaining our export business on its present scale to be met from the profits of other districts selling for inland use at largely increased prices,  i.e.,  some form of unification of the industry voluntarily or by compulsion.It is not proposed In this, memorandum to give the arguments for and against compulsory unification in any form,  or the administrative difficulties involved.A further memorandum on this subject will be submitted shortly.    But without some successful scheme of this kind it seems possible that the large increase of costs &quot;which would follow a reduction of hours in the exporting districts would, in the present condition of the industry at home and abroad, mean either a further reduction of wages or else a substantial curtailment of work both for miners in those districts and also for shipping and all the other trades- and persons dependent upon them.-The prospect might be less alarming if we were able to compete with some of our foreign competitors on more equal terms. There is no doubt that in Poland for instance the standard of ^ages of the mine-workers is far below that of this country. Inquiries into the hours, wages and conditions in the coal mining countries of Europe are now being conducted by the International Labour Office    and the Economic   Committee of the League of Nations.The present positions in regard to these Inquiries are as follows:-
1.    The International Labour Office is pursuing an Inquiry into the facts about hours, wages and conditions in the mining areas of the world,  and it is understood that the information it is collecting will be ready for presentation in the early Autumn,* 2.    The Economic Committee of the League of Nations held consultations with experts on the owners!   side from each country and on the workmen&apos;s side separately and presented a Report containing the facts given and opinions expressed at those consultations *This Report contained no recommendations and the Economic Committee have to hold further consultations and make recommenda-tions. The real point at issue with regard to hours etc  is whether ultimately attempts shall be made to secure International regulation of hours, wages and conditions.The attitude of the late Government in connection with these Inquiries was designed to prevent or, failing prevention, to delay the Inquiries as much as possible.    The Government had no intention of interfering with mining hours in this country and they therefore wished as much as possible to prevent international discussions about mining hours.    A similar attitude was naturally adopted by the coal owners in this country.The fact that the present Government is committed to deal wi-feb. hours of work in the mining industry makes a very big change in the situation, and it is possible that this change.might be utilised as a means of avoiding the consequences which would follow an immediate repeal of the Eight Hours Act.    It is suggested that possibly the Miners&apos; Federation could be persuaded that completion of the International Labour Office Inquiry and a joint consultation between owners and men of all the producing countries, in the hope that this might be followed by an international agreement on hours, wages and conditions, must

Possibly the Federation would be satisfied if the Prime Minister (who has stated his intention of attending the next meeting of the Council of the League of Nations) announced that at that meeting he would press that the further consultations should be carried through and a conference convened at the earliest possible moment and that the British Government would give every facility    in their power to enable this to be done.It is not possible at present to state definitely what would be the attitude of the owners towards this proposal, but they could probably be persuaded to support the suggestion, or at any rate not to oppose it.Another matter of importance to the coal industry in the international discussions is the proposal to endeavour to negotiate an international arrangement for the regulation of markets.    Here again it is suggested that it might be possible to persuade the Miners1 Federation that an attempt to negotiate an international convention about hours, wages and conditions, must necessarily precede any attempt to negotiate a convention dealing with the regulation of marketse
