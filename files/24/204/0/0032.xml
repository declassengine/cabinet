TTTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY15 GOVERNMENT).SECRET Copy No,   gjjfe &amp;fCo?. 185(29)CABINET.HOME PRODUCED MEAT AND BREAD FOR THE FORCES.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.The late Government In their Election programme proposed that home fed beef should be supplied to the Army, Air Force and Navy in home ports during the six months from October to March on six days in each week.    On one day a week the existing frozen mutton ration would be continued.    They also proposed that the flour supplied to Army and Air Force bakeries during the six months after harvest should contain 25% of English wheat.In view of the depression which exists in agriculture and the desirability of doing what we can to mitigate it, I recommend that we should carry out these proposals.&quot;  During our previous term of office in 1924 we initiated measures for the reform of agricultural marketing, one of the objects of which was to encourage the greater U3e of home grown produce.    I think the Government ought to give a lead to the public in this respect in its own contracts.   The Melchett-Tilletft Report on Industrial Reorganisation and Industrial Relations recommends that orders for Government and Municipal Departments should be placed In this country.Meat.The substitution of fresh meat would not, I understand,present any difficulty so far as the contract machinery isconcerned.    The extra cost for six days&apos; supply of fresh beefduring the six months from the 1st of October to the 31st ofMarch is estimated at  245,000 per annum.    During this period3tipplies of English cattle are most plentiful, so that theproposal is not likoly to cause any noticeable increase in prices,but
but would probably prevent a slump and steady the market.    This would help to mitigate the heavy fall in prices which normally occurs in the autumn.The index figure for the price of fat cattle for the month of May was only 32/? above pre-war and it is therefore very desirable from an agricultural standpoint to do something to help the raisers of cattle.    The present proposal would assist during the first three months those farmers who fatten cattle on grass during the summer and during the last three months it would help the farmers who fatten cattle in the yard during the winter.The Ministry is at present working out a scheme for the sale of graded English beef to come into operation next winter, and if the Services would specify graded supplies in their contracts in 1930 it would be of considerable help to the marketing scheme.Importers of Australian beef are, I understand, urging that if home fed beef were supplied to the Forces, its place would be taken by increased Argentine supplies and so represent a net loss of demand from the standpoint of the Empire producer.    This argument is of doubtful validity.    All the best Argentine beef that can be spared already comeB to this country and there is a difficulty in maintaining these supplies.   Hence, there is ho reason why the small gap in civilian supplies created by the Forces&apos; demands should not be filled by Australian frozen meat, which is much superior to frozen supplies from any other source or, indeed, to the inferior grades of chilled.    The Australian frozen boef trade should not, therefore, suffer any permanent injury from the proposal to supply fresh meat to the Forces.When first announced the proposal was for home killed meat, but later it was stated that the contracts would be confined to home fed cattle, thereby shutting out imported live cattle (from Ireland) which are slaughtered at the port of arrival.
arrival.    It may be a little diffioult to enforce the home fed provision, but from the reception which this announcement obtained there is no doubt that farmers in this country attach considerable importance to it and I think we ought to keep to**** dthat definition if possible.On political grounds there are good reasons for going on with the scheme.    It will be a valuable gesture of our good intentions towards agriculture at the very outset of our 1Career.   I&apos;5e know that farmers appreciate it and we shall be depriving our opponents of a valuable argument for use at the next Election.It would be unfair to penalise the funds available for the Services for the benefit of the British farmer, and I hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will allow the sum involved to count as additional to the ordinary expenditure of the Forces.Bread.The case for helping the wheat grower is even stronger as the index figure for wheat in May was only 25% above pre-war, and there are large surplus supplies of wheat in North America, so that prices are more likely to fall than to rise in the near future.   The percentage of English wheat at present used by millers varies considerably from time to time according to the harvest, the season of the year, and the relative cost of English and Imported grain.   Enquiries some time ago showed that under the most favourable conditions it probably varied between 10,; and 20%, but throughout the country as a whole the proportion of English wheat actually used in bread is less than 10%.   To stipulate for the vise of 25% of home grown wheat in the manufacture of flour for the Army and Air Force would therefore be a considerable advance on the general practice at present, and it would certainly be a helpful gesture of sympathy towards the British wheat growerin
in his present difficulties.    The bulk of the English wheat is thrown on the market within about six months after harvest, and it was for this reason that the proposal to use 25% of English wheat was confined to that period of six months.    The proposal was not extended to the Navy as it is nocossary to have flour of low moisture content for naval use, 1, It is difficxxlt to say what will be the precise effectof such&quot; a stipulation on Army contracts for the supply of flour, but it is considered that there would be little Increase in cost.N.B.th June, 1929,
