SECRET. Copy No.    28CP. 195 (29).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken &apos; to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE FIGHTING SERVICES.First Report dealing with the Naval Construction Programme.(Revised Version., circulated in accordance with Cabinet 28 (29), Conclusion 8 (ii).)WE are now in a position to report to the Cabinet our recommendations on the subject of the Naval Construction Programme.2. Our first step was to obtain from the Admiralty detailed information as to the manner in which Navy Votes and employment in the Dockyards and in the country would be affected by a cancellation, in whole or in part, of the New Construction Programme, 1928.3. It became clear at an early stage of our Inquiry that the largest savings on the 1928-29 Programme were obtainable in respect of the two Cruisers &quot; Surrey &quot; and &quot;Northumberland,&quot; building at Portsmouth and Devonport respectively. Apart from economy, suspension of work on these two Cruisers offers a strong political advantage as a gesture of good faith in connection with the international negotiations for the reduction and limitation of naval armaments.4. Consequently, when inviting the Admiralty, to submit proposals for the reduction of the 1928 New Construction Programme by a sum of &amp;1\ to  1^ millions, we asked them to include the suspension of work on these two Cruisers. We also asked them to bear in mind the importance of not allowing the whole of the economies to fall on the Naval Dockyards.5. After careful examination of the Admiralty&apos;s proposals, we submit the following for the approval of the Cabinet:.- -Estimated Saving.  (a.) Suspend all work on &quot;Surrey&quot; and &quot; Northumber-land,&quot;  building at  Portsmouth  and Devonportrespectively  ... ... ... --. 976,000lb.) Cancel Submarine Depot Ship &quot; Maidstone,&quot; building at Chatham ... ... ... ... ...      134,000(c.) Cancel two contract Submarines   ... ... ...      120,000(d.) Slow down Dockyard work on other New Construction,including Chatham Submarine ... ... ...        20,000[19592]Total1,250,000[This Document ia the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.&apos;!Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1929.
6. The saving of  1,250,000 effected by this plan is gross, and will be subject to some adjustment for payments in respect of work already completed and as compensation. The scheme enables the reductions asked for to be made with the least dislocation of work in Naval Dockyards and private yards, and retains intact the Destroyer and Sloop programmes. In the Naval Dockyards the effect will be to reduce labour expenditure in 1929 by approximately  159,000, and will involve the early discharge of about 1,200 men. This is exclusive of dislocation of labour in private industries affected.7. As regards the 1929-30 Programme of New Construction, as the Cabinet have already been informed by the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty (Paper C. P. 162 (29), page 3), no commitments would in any case have to be entered into before the Autumn, and no steps would be taken to proceed with it without consideration by the Cabinet Committee and approval by the Cabinet.8. The question of the Singapore Base is still under consideration, and will form the subject of a separate Report.(Note. I draw the attention of the Cabinet to the labour situation involved in above.   Promises were given to consider responsibilities for discharges.)(Initialled) J. R. M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 6, 1929.
