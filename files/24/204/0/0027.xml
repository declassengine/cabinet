35S   to naval DICTATION AITO LIvSARIIUlEIIT oThe present phase of the question of naval limitation and reduction is primarily concerned with the endeavour to find a solution of the cruiser problem,,    This cruiser problem was the cause of the breakdown of the Coolidge tfeueva Conference of lS27o    In the succeeding months continuous efforts were made to arrive at a compromise which might bo acceptable to all parties, but these efforts were fruitless and the problem up to the meeting of the last Preparatory Commission remained much in the same stage as it had been in 19270The Geneva Conference of 1927 had been summoned by President Coolidge with the object of furthering the work which had been begun with the Washington&quot; Treaty of 1S22, Under that treaty an agreed limitation had been arrived atin regard to the larger classes of vesselss namely, capital ships and aircraft carrierso     With regard to all the other classes, however, no limitation (except a limit of 1030CO tons and a gun of 8 inch caiuhre for cruisers) had been imposed by the treaty, and therefore although the danger in regard to competition in the heaviest type of naval armaments had been eliminated there still remained the possibility of competition in po\7erful cruisers and other expensive typesoThe Conference met and although it broke up without agreeing as regards cruiser strengthss nevertheless on sevei*al important matters it shewed that there was agreement in principle between the UjS^A. and ourselves.   Both countries agreed that it was desirable to proceed with limitation by a medium of classification, that is to say, vessels would be divided into various classes - cruisers,  flotilla leaders, destroyers,  submarines - each class being considered separately and a definite limitation imposed.     With regardto /
to all classes, with the exception of cruisers, the conversations indicated that agreement could be reached.    Only with regard to cruisers was there a deadlockaThe difficulty in regard to cruisers arose at the Geneva Conference owing to the difference in the needs of the two countries    vie3 dependent for our food supplies in war on the security of our sea conmrnni cat ions, require a number of cruisers^    This number is only partly dependent on the number of cruisers possessed by the enemy*   Thus, if an enemy possesses 15 eruisers, or 20 cruisers, makes little difference to the number of cruisers we required to secure our communications In this respect, our cruiser strength is absoluteo    If, on the other- hand, an - enemy only possesses one cruiser we, naturally,  should not require so many cruisers0    In this respect our cruiser strength is relative to the enemy0JiFor practical purposes, taking naval strengths as they are to-day, the number of cruisers we require has been estimated at about 70a      In order to get this number on a low total tonnage figure., we require that individual cruisers should be saiall and inexpensive.    The U,SaAv3 on the other hand, considers that her naval needs can only be met by cruisers of the largest size, carrying 8&quot; guns,    Of these, she requires a comparatively small number as compared with the number of small cruisers we requireoAlthough as between America and ourselves (the assumption being that war between the two countries is absolutely ruled out) agreement could be reached in America building her large cruisers, few in number, and we building our small cruisers and more in number, this agreement could not, from our point of view, be incorporated in a settlement which was finally to become international..   We had to consider other oountrieso    If America?s idea that there was to be no limitation of the 8&quot; gun cruis or was to stand, then othercountries/
countries would build these 8&quot; gun cruisers and the small cruisers which we proposed would not be sufficient for security purposes.     :.7e should then have to build large cruisers, and in order to get the requisite number the total tonnage figure would be one which would be too high to embody in a disarmament convention to which UoSeA. would sxfbscribeaThe interval of time which has elapsed since Geneva has resulted in the opposing views of the British Empire and the U &amp;S *Ao in this matter being more fully appreciated by each others   The failure of what has been termed the iuoglo^-Srench compromise has not been without effect in this direction.)   Various suggestions have been forthcoming on both sides with the object of endeavouring to estimate respective cruiser strengths and to male allowance for special requirements.    The latest suggestion and one which offers possibilities was made by mr Gibson at the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission of the league of ITatL onsc   Eo definite information of the American proposals is yet forthcoming, but it is understood that the idea is that we should consider the existing cruiser strengths in ships built, building and authorised of the British Empire and the U-.SoA. as roughly parityoHaving made this assumption, we should then devise a formula giving values to the various classes of cruisers possessed by both countries, the formula being designed so that the total cruiser tonnage worked out in accordance with the formula for the U^S^A. and ourselves comes to the same figureo    This formula would then form what the Americans call a &quot;yard-stick&quot; or measure by whioh in future we can measure cruiser strengths and make suggestions for reductions using always the same measures the practical effect of the &quot;yard-stick&quot; would be that it would be possible to construct an equation in which one /
tm     Q     *mone 10,000 ton 8&quot; gun ship would equal a certain number of small 6&quot; gun ships.     Provided the equation was satisfactory, this would permit of nations obtaining their cruiser require-ments either in a few large ships or a greater number of small ships on a total tonnage which, as measured by the &quot;yard-stick&quot;, would not appear excessive.The question whether it is possible to reach agreement as to the basis on which the &quot;yard*-stick&quot; is to be constructed will, it is presumed, be investigated in forthcoming conversa-tions with the TJaS.A.   Considerations of importance arise in obhnection with procedure at such conversations but these will not be discussed in this paper which is concerned only with a brief history of the general question.finally, it should be recogtaised that the question of cruiser limitation is only a part of the problem of naval reduction.   V/e look to real naval reduction and curtailment of expenditure being achieved by reduction in the size of all the main types of naval vessels, and we are prepared to go still further in this direction, especially in regard to the size of capital ships.Further, naval reduction is only part of the general reduction of all armed forces undertaken by the League of. Nations and in which we have already indicated our willing-ness to make considerable concessions as regards land foroes.
