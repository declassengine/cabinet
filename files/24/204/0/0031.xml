IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.9 (i 0   IRET, 184 (29)Copy No,44.CABINET.inquiries Into Iron and Steel and Cotton Industries. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.b.22 (29) elusion 2 )1.    It was decided at the Cabinet held on June 10th that I should advise my colleagues on the proposed enquiries into the iron and steel and cotton industries. With this object in view I have been holding a series of conferences with representatives of all seotions of these industries including the operatives.   My conversations with representatives of the various cotton organisations are still proceeding but I am now in a position to make definite proposals in regard to the   -iron and steel inquiry.2.    In December of last year the Iron and Steel Trades&apos; Confederation wrote to the late Prime Minister asking for the appointment of a Commission or Committee on the Iron and Steel Industry, in order &quot;to ascertain so far as possible all the facts with regard to its present position, with special reference to the nature of the competition in the Home Market, and to make suoh recommendations, whether as regards action by the industry itself or legislative action, as in the considered judgment of the appointed body the circumstances required, due regard being paid to all legitimate interests&quot;,    In particular the Confederation suggested enquiry Into (a) organisation, technical and mechanical equipment and financial policy;    (b) handicaps in regard to raw materials, transport, or marketing; (o) factors of competition arising from trade restrictions and barriers on the part of its competitors;    (d) factors of competition  arising from lower standards of wages, hours and labour oonditions in competing countries, including non-observance of international labour conventions;    (e) factors-1-
of competition arising from subsidies, direct or indirect, or other similar measures in competing countries,1    and (f) the cost of unemployment not only in actual expenditure for the maintenance of the unemployed but in the waste of skill and loss of morale, and the possibilities of the capitalised value of this or its equivalent being applied productively as a part of an organised scheme dealing with the industry.The proposal was rejected at the time by the late Government and in his Election Address the present Prime Minister stated that &quot;a Labour Government .... will grant the requests of the Gotton, Iron and Steel Industries for an enquiry into their conditions with a view to dealing with them&quot; .3.    It is clearly necessary that the enquiry to which the Government is thus pledged should be as comprehensive and expeditious as possible, and I have given anxiouo consideration to the question of the form of enquiry best adapted to that end.4,   Enquiry by Royal Commission or Departmental Committee, which is the most obvious course, has the advantage that the proceedings are constantly under publio notice.   But it has the disadvantages that the procedure is necessarily formal and therefore likely to be protracted;    that it is difficult for Ministers to take part in it;    that the witnesses may for personal or trade reasons feel unable, however willing they may be, to speak as frankly as if the proceedings were private, and   may attempt to make out before the public the best case for the interests which they represent, as against other interests;    and it is scarcely possible to avoid publishing the Report in full, even though it may contain matter the publioation of which may be detrimental to our commercial interests overseas.
5.   The alternative oourae is enquiry by the Committee of Civil Research which, as my colleagues are aware, consists of such persons as are summoned by the   Prime Minister for consideration of any question which he may refer to them. The advantages of this form of enquiry are that it is possible for Ministers to take part in it;    that the Committee can adopt any kind of procedure which may be most convenient and expeditious;    that its proceedings are entirely private and so afford opportunity for frank and informal discussion;    and that it reports to the Prime Minister and it rests with him to determine how much of the Report can bo made public.6.    I have consulted Sir William Larke, Direotor of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers, which represents practically the whole of the heavy Iron and Steel Industries, and Mr, Arthur Pugh, Secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades&apos; Confederation, who both agree with me in thinking that an enquiry of this kind would in all the circumstances bo likely to be the most useful course.    I understand that in putting forward their request to the late Government the Confederation had no particular form of enquiry in mind and that they do not attach importance to it being public.   I may remind my colleagues that the course now proposed was adopted by the late Government in regard to the application made by the Iron and Stoel Industry under the Safeguarding of Industries prooedure in 1925.7.   The Terms of Reference to the Committee might be:-wTo consider and report upon the present condition and prospects of the Iron and Steel Industries and to make recommendations as to any action which may appear desirable and practicable in order to improve the position of those industries in the markets of the world&quot;.
O V O3. If tiie Cabinet agree that a Committee of Civil Research should be set up, I think that Its membership 3hould be a3 small as possible, and I recommend that it should consist of:-Two Ministers,  of whom one should be ChairmanjOne person of industrial and commercial experience;One Trade Union representative;One economist.I recommend that an officer of the Board of Trade shall be a joint Secretary to the Committee.W.
