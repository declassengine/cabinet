htfl document is the property of Hia Britannio Majesty^ Gpveminent,\.CRET. 7l9S (29) .0 A B i N E T.Application by Leon Trotsky for permission to reside in England.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.At its meeting on the 26th June last (Cabinet Conclusions 24(29) page 4) the Cabinet agreed that for the moment no decision should be taken on Trotsky&apos;s application for permission to visit England, but it does not seem possible to postpone a decision any longer.      Three Members of Parliament (Sir George Penny, Sir John Power, and Colonel Wedgwood) have given notice of Questions to ask on   Thursday next the 11th instant whether Trotsky will be permitted to come to England and it will then,  I think, be necessary to announce the Governments decision.Since I circulated my memorandum CP.165(29) on the 24th June, representations have been made through Madame Paz (Magdeleine Marx), a personal friend of Trotsky,  that Trotsky is willing to give an undertaking not to interfere while here in the affairs of this country, to reside at any place which the Authorities might  select, and to submit to any surveillance whichimight be deemed necessary.      It is also urged that,  if the Government were not prepared to allow him to come,  an adverse decision should not be made public until he had had an opportunity-% which a refusal on the part of the British Government might prejudice - of finding asylum elsewhere.I have also received a letter from the Independent Labour Party whioh repeats the above-mentioned undertakings, but adds that a telegram has been received from Trotsky asking,  if his request for permission to enter England for an indefinite period is refused,  that he should be allowed to come for one month to obtain expert medical opinion on his illness and to receive the necessary treatment.      The Independent Labour Party also inform
9th July,  1929.me that some time ago they invited Trotsky to come to England to lecture to their summer school.I have already in my previous memorandum set out the considerations which,  in my view,  are decisive against compliance with Trotsky&apos;s application for permission to come here for an indefinite period.      The compromise now suggested that he should be allowed to come here for one month seems to be open to the insuperable objection that once he comes to this country it will be impossible later to secure his departure, and I cannot recommend my colleagues to allow him to come here even on a temporary visit.Trotsky&apos;s application was received on the 10th June, and in view of the public interest which has been aroused,  it would be difficult to justify in the House of Commons any further delay in coming to a decision unless we were prepared to state    the real reason.      Such a statement would, of course, frustrate the whole purpose of the postponement.In view of these considerations, T should like to obtain   * the authority of my colleagues to make a statement in the House on Thursday next to the effect that the Government have carefully considered Trotsky&apos;s application but regret that it is not possible to afford him facilities to come to this country.
