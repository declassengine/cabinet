aTHIS LXDCUMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,Copy No.LOCAL GOVERNMENT SCOTLAND ACT,  (1929 ).T.,197 (29).Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Scotland.Since my Memorandum C.P, 161 (29) on the subject of the Local Government (Sootland) Act, 1929, I have been impressed by the representations which hare been made to me of the state of opinion among Scottish Labour and Liberal Members in the House of Commons on the subject and by the volume and intensity of the public demand for amendment of certain clauses in the Bill.I do not consider that any amendment of the clauses relating to the incorporation of Poor Law or burghal public health functions in County Council administration is a practical proposition. To attempt such an amendment would mean the recasting of considerable sections of the de-rating clauses in the present Act and would afford great opportunities for obstruction and consumption of parliamentary time by the Opposition.     While the Liberals may make a demonstration in the House of Commons of their sympathy for the burghs I am convinced that we can easily show that in the limited time at our disposal before the adjournment and in view of the urgency and importance of unemployment, housing and other measures, it is impossible for us to proceed with any amendment of the clauses relating to the small burghs or the Parish Councils.The Act in that respect must therefore in my opinionstand.The suspension of the abolition of the ad hoc education authorities is another matter.Every section and class interested in education, with the exception of the Teachers1 OrganiftAtions have petitioned us against the endorsement of the proposals of the late Government until at least there has been held a Parliamentary enquiry as to the educational and administrative merits or demerits of these proposals.     Undoubtedly there is widespread public feeling on the subject and I have reason to believe that every Scottish Liberal, with one exception, and every Scottish Labour Member of Parliament would support a short Bill suspending the abolition of the ad hoc authorities pending enquiries.     Indeed the Liberals have officially tabled an amendment to the King&apos;s Speech because it contained no reference to amendments of the Scottish Local Government Bill.If it were made clear that the Teachers&apos; Organisation would participate in any enquiry and that enquiry could and would &quot;be speedily held, the Opposition would cut a poor figure if it offered anything beyond a perfunctory criticism.     On the other hand a short suspensory Bill, pending enquiry, would give effect to the election promises and attitude of possibly two-thirds of the Members of Parliament returned from Scotland, and to some such course the leading Opposition organs would appear to have been resigned after the Eleotion.The/
The Law Offioers -upon my instructions have now considerably shortened the proposed Bill and have eliminated everything except the bare proposal to suspend the clauses abolishing the ad hoc education authorities.     A copy of the draft Bill is alT ached.This reduces the possible demand upon Parliamentary time which a Bill would involve, and I am advised that about four or five days would suffice.If a suspensory Bill such as I have indicated be not introduced we shall have to resist considerable pressure and criticism from our own Benches during, the Debate upon the Liberal amendment.     That amendment wa should defeat in the Hi vision Lobbies, but in so doing we mi^ht needlessly irritate our own supporters and make a present to the Liberals of public Bupport that it is undesirable they should obtain.     Tor these reasons I strongly recommend that the decision previously taken not to proceed with this suspensory Bill should be rescinded and that on the contrary the Bill should be introduced and oarried through all its stages before the House rises in July.m.
