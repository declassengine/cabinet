This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.Printed for the Cabinet, July, 1929.SECREX.CP. Xm (.29.).THE CABINET.HOME PRODUCED MEAT AND BREAD FOR THE FORGES.memo RAND U. M B.Y. THE. SECRETARY OE STATE FOR WAR:1. I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the following considerations arising out of the proposals contained in the Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP. 185 (29) ) on home produced, meat and bread for the forces.I; Meat.2. The supply of fresh, in place of frozen, meat to the troops at home (Army and Air Force) for. the six months 1st October to .31st March for six days a week&apos; would involve an addition to Army and Airt. Force expenditure of about  200,000 a year, with no. compensating reduction and no benefit to the services. As the Minister of &quot;Agriculture says in his. Memorandum, the funds available for the Army and Air&apos; Force could not fairly berpenaljzed for, the benefit of the. British farmer ; but any hope-that an addition of . 200,000. could., be., made-to the Estimates of the two Departments without I the sacrifice of,other services must, in. my opinion, be regarded as illusory. In the&quot;next year or two. thg: Services, have to face great financial difficulties arising, in their own sphere, and:.any addition of this.kind to their burden will be a most serious matter.Experience shows that any proposal to add a special s am for a particular service to the amount allotted to Army Estimates in a future year is not likely to be&apos;&apos;realized^- A global sum. is fixed by the.Government, and it is within that total that all1 services have to be financed. The particular service in fact extrudes others which maybe of immediate and direct military value.If it be Government policy to help the farmer, I suggest that the proper and appropriate method is for concessions to be given from Civil and not from Service Votes.3. So far from benefiting the troops, there is a grave danger that the scheme will result in a deterioration in the quality of the supplies. Experience of the fresh meat system before the war showed that, there was very great difficulty in maintaining the requisite quality, and the black-listing of contractors for attempting to pass inferior supplies was of frequent occurrence. How far the scheme which the Ministry of Agriculture are said to be working out for the sale of graded English beef will go to meet the difficulty I cannot say, but any such scheme to be of real use would have to be in general operation, otherwise any attempt to exclude meat not so graded would be doomed to failure.4. Nor does there seem to be any certainty that the British farmer would secure the advantage for which the services are asked to make this sacrifice of their interests. Fresh meat maybe the produce either-of-(l) animals-raised--in this country, or (2) imported animals fattened here for some months before slaughter, or (3) imported animals killed on disembarkation at the port of entry. I think the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s memo-randum under-rates the difficulty of enforcing the home-fed provision. Even experts are doubtful of their ability to distinguish between the three kinds. The experiment of stipulating for home-grown meat was tried in the early years of the present century, and was abandoned in favour of home-killed meat mainly because of the difficulty of ensuring that the Army got what it contracted for. Practically all imported animals now come from the Irish Free State, and if the substitution of fresh for frozen meat resulted in(B29/17)   75   7/29   W.O.P.   4519Cory. No,-, o (j
practice in supplies being mainly the produce of class (.3) above, the effect of the policy would be to&apos; give a preference of from 75 per cent, to 100 per cent, to the Irish Free State over the Australasian Dominions. To a lesser degree the same would apply in so far as the meat supplied fell under class (2), i.e., animals imported for a few months&apos; fattening.5. Lastly, the effect on Dominion sentiment is a consideration to be borne in mind. I note that the Minister of Agriculture expects that the gap in civilian supplies of home-fed meat created by the demands of the Forces will be filled by Australian frozen meat and that the Australian frozen meat trade will not suffer any permanent injury. The Imported Meat Trade Association have represented to me that to the extent that the Services are successful in obtaining fresh meat of good quality, the Argentine exporters will increase their shipments of chilled meat to make good the shortage, and Argentine chilled meat will then be brought in in substitution for Australian frozen meat ; for the ordinary consumer, chilled meat is easier to handle than, and therefore preferred to, frozen meat. That is, at any rate, a possible view of the effect of the measure ; but whichever view proves to be the correct one, it is not clear that the British farmer will gain.6. Quite apart from the objection on the ground of the cost to the Army, the above considerations lead me to doubt whether the feeding of the troops on fresh meat is the most effective method of benefiting agriculture.II. Bread.7. Bread for the Army and the Air Force is obtained by one of two methods (1) at certain large stations (Aldershot, Catterick, Cranwell, &amp;c.) the bread is made in Government bakeries- from flour bought by my Department, and (2) at all other stations by contracts made with the local bakers.8. In the case of pui*chases of bread obtained from local bakers it would hardly be practicable to stipulate for anything different from the ordinary trade product.9. To stipulate for the use of 25 per cent, of home-grown wheat in the manufacture of flour for Army and Air Force bakeries is considered by the Ministry of Agriculture to be quite practicable for the six months immediately succeeding harvest. But it would be a considerable advance on the general present practice of millers, and for that reason might have in certain cases a detrimental effect on the quality of the loaf and its cost. Further, it is impossible to determine by inspection or chemical test, either of the flour or the bread made from it, whether any specified proportion of English wheat has been actually included, and there are obvious objections to making contract stipulations which cannot be effectively enforced.10. The bread made in Army and Air Force bakeries represents only abour one-eighth of one per cent, of the total consumption of the country.T. S.The War Office,2nd July, 1929.
