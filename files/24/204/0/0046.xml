ftEBISL DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT). SBORETO.P.199.(S9) CABINET.Liquor advert!sementa in Post Off!peg. Memorandum by the Postmaster General.1. Liquor advertisements are at present permitted in Post Offloe Buildings and Publications,   As this was a Cabinet decision during the last government it is necessary to have another Cabinet decision as to whether the system shall be oontinued.     This question first arose in 1912 when, on the transfer of the National Telephone Company&apos;s service to the State, the Post Office became responsible for the telephone directories.

This polioy held the field until 1926 when it was reversed by the late Government, and the current advertising contracts admit of liquor advertisements being displayed.2. A bar on these advertisements would result In the sacrifice of a small source of revenue at present yielding about  4,000 per annum.3.   When the prohibition existed, it was the practice to reject the advertisements of Temperance Societies as relating to alcoholic liqu&amp;r, on the ground that the Department must not favour one party to the liquor controversyj   when the prohibition was removed the Temperance Societies demanded, and were readily allowed,  the right to display their advertisements.   If the prohibition is re-imposed, it will presumably have to be applied to theTemperanceCopy No,
Temperance advertisements,  cf which there are probably 000 in various Poet Offices.4C   I am, myself, disposed to recommend that liquor advertisements should be excluded on the ground   that it is inexpedient to exhibit in State Publications or Properties advertisements which are obnoxious to a considerable section of the public.H0Bo L-S.GENERAL POST OFFICE, -9th July,  1929 o
