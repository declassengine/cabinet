THIS DOCUMENT IS THE, PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEIjIsENT ] .SECRET. C.P. 175/29.COPY HO.CABINET.MEMORANDUM by the PRESIDENT of the BOARD 03? EDUCATION.KIKCUB    SPEECH. RAISING the SCHOOL LEAVING AGE to EIETEEN.We are deeply committed both as part of our unemployment polioy and as an urgent educational reform to raising the school leaving age by one year to 15, and I have suggested that a reference to this should be made in the King&apos;s Speech, in terms which will be consistent -with the introduction of the necessary Bill within the next session.The question whether the Bill should provide for a more or less immediate raising of the school age (e.g. as from 1st April or 1st October, 1930) or for fixing a date some time further ahead is a matter which could be determined subsequently after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ the Secretary of State for Scotland and, possibly, after negotiation with the Local Education Authorities.25th June, 1929.
