04mmiS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Iecret^ OOPY NO.^to.P. 166 (29)-CABINET. Australian Tariff Preferenoe. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Mr. Bruce, the prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, informed our Trade Commissioner some time ago that it was his intention to set up a Committee of responsible officers of the various Departments to study the incidence of preferences and the general question of British trade with Australia, and he invited Mr. Dalton to lend his help and to keep in touch with the Committee so that he might be able to furnish such Information as was available in regard to competitive conditions.    Mr. Dalton has suggested that the leading trade bodies in this country should be consulted in the matter and steps are being taken to do this.    Mr. Bruce has now given wider publicity to his proposals in a speech which he delivered recently at the Victoria League Club at Melbourne. A full report of the speech appeared by arrangement in the Daily Telegraph of June ISth, copy of which is annexed.    It will be observed that Mi&apos;. Bruoe considers that it should be possible to stimulate the trade of this country with Australia by alterations in the Australian preferential Tariff system and that -he is anxious to approaoh the matter in a spirit of co-operation.It is not likely that Mr. Bruce will introduce at an early date any very far reaching changes in the Australian Tariff, especially having regard to this declared intention of raising the question of inter-imperial trade at the next meeting of the Imperial Conference,    But it appears to me important that any steps he may be prepared to take in this direction in
advance of the Imperial Conference should meet with a ready response from this side.    Australia is one of our principal markets and anything which goes to mitigate the difficulties of which traders here have often and reasonably complained must have a bearing upon the state of employment in this country.It is for this reason that it appeared to me desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take an early opportunity of expressing to Mr. Bruce their appreciation of his attitude.I am proposing to take an early opportunity of referring to the matter in public and I should be glad if my colleagues would bear it in mind in connection with any speeches they may be making in the near future.W. G.Board of Trade,35th June,  1929.

1CODAILY TELEGRAPH.18th june?. 1929 .Suggestions wanted.Plea for Go-operation.From our own Correspondent. Sydney,   Monday.The speech delivered by Mr. Bruoe, commonwealth prime Minister, at the Victoria League Club, in Melbourne,discussing the future trade relations of Australia and GreatBritain, has apparently caused a misunderstanding in officialoircles in London.    The authorities here have thereforerequested me to summarise the statements made, which are ofgreat interest, but which were not hitherto available fullyowing to defective publicity arrangements.   Mr. Bruce said:&quot;Australians do not sufficiently realise the great privileges they have in being a part of the British nation.   Having this great oltizenship, it is necessary to look into the future and to try to see how this great British nation can be held together0 Constitutional difficulties., which pessimists said were going to wreck the Empire, have passed.    The nations of the Empire must therefore consider what other problems they must solve.    It must be remembered that the position of Britain in the past did not depend on armed strength, but on her prominent place among the nations in the realms of commerce ana. industry.    The future depends on the maintenance of that position.    This can be done if all the members of the Empire recognise that they have a common interest in solving the problem,AUSTRALIA\S NEEDS,&quot;Australia needs increased population and money to develop her great resources rapidly, and markets in which to sell her increased surplus production.    Tho only place in which she can obtain these things is in Britain, and it is therefore of the utmost importance to Australia that Britain should be prosperous.     The picture of Britain today is almost pathetic.    She must have markets for her produots if employment is to bo provided.    There is only one hope for Britain, that new markets will be created somewhere in the world to absorb the great production of whioh Britain is oapable.&quot;There are signs that at the next Imperial Conference an effort will be made to grapple with the trade relations of the Empire for the development of trade resources in the same way as the Conference of 1926 solved the constitutional relations of the Empire.Australia
Australia is willing and ready to co-operate, but sometimes public opinion in Britain is inclined to view the position as if Australians did not sympathise with them.    It based that opinion on Australia&apos;^ tariff x barriers and the restrictions imposed on importationsinto Australia.    There is no justification for such a suspicion.&quot;The Commonwealth wants to build up her own industries where she can economically do so, but where she cannot provide for her own requirements she wants to get them from Britain and from no other nation.   We might do better if we approached these problems mrtre in thespirit of co-operation.    Statesmen and politicians cannot solve them.   We want co-operation by the leaders of commerce and industry in Australia and Britain.CONSULTING BRITAIN.   .&quot;In the meantime we are going forward examining the question to see how we can help to achieve a.better understanding.     In the past we accepted the policy of Imperial Preference, but never got close enough to that problem, and never consulted Britain and British industry as to where exactly that Preference oan most be helpful.   We are willing to help, provided we op not do anything detrimental to Australia.     The Government recently had a Departmental Committee of experts working to see where the system of British Preference could be improved.     The latest information received from the Committee is that it is able to make suggestions for alterations in the preferences on oertain items by which Britain&apos;s trade can be stimulated and the Australian taxpayer at the same time relieved.&quot;This question of trade co-operation is one which far transcends the politics of any country.    The spirit exists in Australia to co-operate with any Government which may be in power in Britain at any time.   Australia is equally sure that a British Government of any political faith is willing to co-operate with any Government in power in Australia&quot;.Mr. Bruce&apos;a speech has made a most favourable impression among the leaders of commerce, finance, and industry who have been enabled to hear or read it, but unfortunately it received onlya restricted publicity throughout the Commonwealth,
