We transmit herewith to the Governments which took part in the Geneva Decision and to the Reparation Commission our proposals for a complete and final settlement of the reparations problem, including the settlement of the obligations resulting from the existing treaties and agreements between Germany and the Creditor Powers, and we unanimously recommend the following Plan to the Governments concerned.
1. Appointment, Terms of Reference and Constitution.This Committee originated with the decision taken by the Belgian, JSritish, French, German, Italian and Japanese Govern-ments to entrust to independent experts, the task of drawing up proposals for a complete and final settlement of the Reparation problem. Twelve Experts were to be chosen amongst the nationals of countries which participated in this decision, and two amongst the nationals of the United States of America. Each of the experts invited was empowered to appoint an alternate.The appointments of the invited experts as Members of the Committee were made according to the following procedure :The Belgian, British, French, Italian and Japanese Experts were appointed by the Reparation Commission upon the nomination of their respective Governments.The German Experts were appointed by the German Government.The Experts being citizens of the United States of America were appointed by the Reparation Commission conjointly with the German Government.The mandate of the Committee of Experts thus formed is set forth in the following terms of reference : &quot; The Belgian, British, French, German, Italian and Japanese Governments, in pursuance of the decision reached at Geneva on September 16, 1928, whereby it was agreed to set up a committee of independent financial experts, hereby entrust to the Committee the task of drawing up proposals for a complete and final settlement of the reparation problem : these proposals shall include a settlement of the obligations resulting from the existing Treaties and Agreements between Germany and the Creditor Powers. The committee shall address its report to the Governments which took part in the Geneva decision and also to the Reparation Commission.&quot;The Committee was constituted with the following member-ship : Belgian   Experts:    M.   Emile   Francqui,   M.   Camille   Gutt;alternates: Baron Terlinden, M. H. Fabri. French Experts:     M.  Emile Moreau,  M.  Jean Parmentier;alternates: M. C. Moret, M. Edgar Allix. German Experts:    Dr.   Hjalmar   Schacht,   Dr.   A.   Voegler;alternates: Dr. C. Melchior, Mr. L. Rastl. British Experts:      Sir Josiah Stamp, G.B.E., Lord Revelstoke,G.C.V.O.;   alternates:   Sir   Charles   Addis,K.C.M.G.,   Sir   Basil   Blackett,   K.C.B.,JX.C.S.I.47-1 SIA 2
Italian Experts:      De   Alberto   Pirelli,   M.   Fulvio   Suvich;alternates: M. Giuseppe Bianchini, M. Bruno Dolcetta.Japanese Experts:   Mr.    Kengo   Mori,   Mr.    Takashi   Aoki;alternates:      Mr.    Saburo    Sonoda,    Mr.Yasumune Matsui. American Experts: Mr. Owen D. Young, Mr. J. P. Morgan;alternates: Mr. Thos. N. Perkins, Mr. T. w!Lamont.We have to record our deep sense of regret at the death of Lord Eevelstoke, which took place suddenly at an early hour on Friday, April 19th. By his untimely removal from our counsels we suffered the loss of one whose unfailing tact and wisdom had gained the affection and respect of all of us and contributed greatly to our progress. In honour of his memory all meetings were suspended until Tuesday, April 23rd. On April 20th, the Reparation Com-mission unanimously passed a resolution &quot; deploring the death of Lord Revelstoke and instructing the General Secretary to convey an expression of sympathy to the Committee of Experts on the loss of their distinguished colleague.&quot;In a separate communication the Reparation Commission advised the Committee that they had :  &quot; unanimously appointed, on -the nomination of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, Sir Charles Addis, K.C.M.G., to be a member of the Experts&apos; Committee in succession to the late Lord Revelstoke.&quot;On May 23rd the Committee were advised that the German Government had appointed Herr L. Kastl to be a member, in the place of Dr. Voegler, of whose resignation the Committee had learnt with regret on the previous day.2. Meetings of Committee.The Experts met for the first time informally at the Bank of France on Saturday morning, February 9th to fix the date of the first meeting of the Committee and to discuss matters of organisa-tion and procedure.The first regular meeting of the Committee was held on Monday, February 11th at 2 o&apos;clock in the afternoon in the Hotel George V. At this meeting Mr. Owen D. Young was unanimously chosen Chairman.The Committee has been in continuous session over a period of some seventeen weeks. Sub-Committees were set up as required for the study of particular questions, and met frequently in the intervals between the Plenary Sessions.
3. Attitude of the Committee.The Report of the Dawes Committee opened with the following words : &quot; We have approached our task as business men anxious to obtain effective results. We have been concerned with the technical, and not the political, aspects of the problem pre-sented to us. We have recognised indeed that political con-siderations necessarily set certain limits within which a solu-tion must be found if it is to have any chance of acceptance. To this extent, and to this extent only, we have borne them in mind.&quot;It is in this spirit that the present committee have addressed themselves to the task of rounding off the work of their predecessors which was advisedly left incomplete. By determining the number and amount of the annuities and by providing for the conversion of the reparation debt from a political to a commercial obligation, they have to the best of their ability tried to perform the task committed to them of devising a scheme which might fairly be accepted by all parties concerned.Throughout our deliberations and in our present proposals we have endeavoured to reach our conclusions on economic and financial grounds. But we have realised, like our predecessors, that political factors necessarily set certain limits within which a solution had to be found if our proposals were to secure acceptance. We had therefore to base our decisions not only on economic but also to some extent on political considerations. Many important juridical questions are also involved, and while as financial experts we are not specially qualified for going into details on them, their broader aspects have been always in our minds. Indeed it has been clear to us that close attention to them would have made our handling of the larger questions well-nigh impossible; but the Committee is satisfied that the scheme it recommends is within its terms of reference.The meeting of the present Committee of Experts marks the first occasion of which representatives of all these six nations chiefly&quot; concerned (together with American Experts) have sat down together to work out on a large scale the common problems of reparations, and to co-operate in exploring the various means by which Ger-many could be enabled to discharge her obligations.The Dawes Report made no attempt to establish the causes lead-ing up to the situation which its provisions sought to ameliorate. In adhering to this precedent we have attempted to go further, and through the proposed creation of the machinery which we recom-mend, to set up an institution whose direction from the start shall be co-operative and international in character; whose members shall engage themselves to banish the atmosphere of the war, to4749
obliterate its animosities, its partisanships, its tendencious phrases; and to work together for a common end in a spirit of mutual interest and goodwill.4. The Study of Germany&apos;s Economic Conditions. During the course of its deliberations the Committee have given close consideration to the various aspects of Germany&apos;s present economic position and future potentialities, because of their mate-rial relation to her capacity, to discharge obligations to foreign creditors.The Committee had among their number six members of the Dawes Committee of 1924, whose contact with this aspect of the subject was obviously at that time close and responsible. Further the Committee includes several who have been associated with the practical working of the plan. These members have naturally had an unusual and continuous interest in the course of events unrolled during the past five years.Furthermore, the periodical Reports made by the Agent-General and Trustees and Commissioners upon the working of the Dawes Plan and the Reports of the Reichsbank itself, have given com-prehensive reviews of Germany&apos;s position and development. The body of knowledge so available and the public interest .and discussion it lias stimulated, have been of the greatest assistance to the Committee.Moreover, they have been specially assisted by the able and lucid descriptions of the present economic condition of Germany and the possibilities of German development which have been made by the German Experts, who were well fitted by their respective positions in Germany to give, in combination, an impressive review of the subject. The considerations put forward by them in our numerous discussions and in answer to the questions addressed to them have been a constant and powerful influence in leading us to our conclusions.The German Experts have given the Committee complete infor-mation to the demands for foreign capital made by German economy during recent years, and as to the items which in their opinion counteracted this; external assets of Germany, reconstitution of the stocks and of the machinery of the country. The productivity of capital thus invested has been discussed by the Committee, who have also considered the comparison between the fiscal burdens and the burdens of public debt in Germany and in other countries.The German Experts have also made statements before the Committee as to the present state of German industry and agri-culture, the general level of wages, the budgetary situation, the balance of payments, the financial effect of compensation to her nationals, the influence upon her trade of Customs barriers abroad, and the special situation of an industrial country such as Germany which has had to reconstitute her working capital, and at the same time assume the burden of heavy international obligations.
The German Experts laid stress on the question of natural resources available to Germany, whether within her borders or not, and on Germany&apos;s capacity to pay as affected thereby.These statements have been present in the consideration of the Experts and in a large measure their conclusions have been influenced bjj, them.It is unnecessary for us to set out the various considerations of an economic character which have led to our conclusions on the capacity of Germany to transfer. We believe that in the scale of annuities and the conditions recommended we have given proper regard to the potentialities of all the economic conditions and financial forces normally and naturally involved. We believe further that, in arranging for a part of the annuity to carry rights of postponement and for impartial enquiry we have provided for the possibility of meeting any abnormal or special difficulty arising which might seriously affect Germany&apos;s capacity for a time, despite all that might be done by Germany&apos;s goodwill and ingenuity to meet such difficulty without having recourse to an altogether exceptional but nevertheless very valuable expedient.As a substitute to the present system of transfer protection with its semi-political controls, its derogation from Germany&apos;s initiative, and its possible reactions upon credit, we are recommending a scheme of annuities appreciably smaller than the Dawes obligations and subject to new and elastic conditions, which are described at length in the succeeding chapters of the present Report. As an internal burden to be borne by annual taxation the scheme we propose is materially less; it is closely assimilated to commercial and financial obligations; it carries with it welcome freedom from&apos; interference and supervision and it is provided with adequate safe-guards against any period so critical as to endanger Germany&apos;s economic life.5. Course of the Proceedings. The Committee addressed themselves, at the outset, to the essential task before them, namely, to determine the number and amount of the annuities to be paid by Germany; but they soon found the amounts were to a considerable extent contingent upon the machinery and form of payment, and therefore that they were not at that stage ready to reach a conclusion either as to the amount of the annuities or the number of years during which they should continue. Moreover, if Germany were to be given a definite task to perform on her own responsibility, and if the Committee were to substitute for many of the features of the Dawes Plan machinery of a non-political character in the realm of general finance, it was clearly necessary to elaborate a system for handling the annuities in a way which so far as it led to their commercialisation would re-move them from the sphere of inter-Governmental relations. In the first instance, some time was occupied by the Committee in hear-ing the statements from the German Experts on German economic4749 A 4
conditions and the outlook for the future, so far as they affected Germany&apos;s capacity to pay obligations in foreign currencies. It then became known that the German Group felt that the ability of Germany to undertake a definite annuity obligation might vary according to the other provisions comprised in the Committee&apos;s recommendations, and in particular according to whether the annuity was entirely unconditional or whether some portion of it was payable under arrangements for postponement in the event of financial and exchange difficulties. The idea was also put for-ward that if such a situation arose, it was desirable for it to be immediately considered by an appropriate non-political committee, acting in an advisory capacity to the Powers concerned, and meet-ing unostentatiously without waiting to be constituted by the lengthy process of diplomatic action. It was quickly realised that since the amount of the burden which Germany could agree to accept was directly related to such concomitant conditions, these conditions must be first explored.At the same time, the possibility of accepting smaller annuities than those fixed under the Dawes Plan was admittedly dependent upon the certitude and ease with which the Creditors could com-mercialise the obligations under non-political conditions.The arrangements that have been in force under the Dawes Scheme for liquidating a part of the annuity by means of deliveries in kind required consideration from two points of view : (a) the substitution for the existing methods of a more elastic machinery which, as the Dawes Committee recommended, should be non-political; and (b) the gradual termination of the system at the earliest moment consistent with existing relationships and with the interests of Germany, whose economic life has been during the past few years gradually adapted to them, and who would feel herself prejudiced in an economic sense by their too sudden termination.The enquiries upon these subjects were found to be converging upon one central point, viz., the nature of the authority which should act as the chief medium for discharging the various functions under a new plan.In the exploration of the problem of substituting authority of an external, financial and non-political character for the present machinery and controls of the Dawes Plan (viz., the adminis-tration of the Agent-General and of the various Commissioners in Berlin, and those functions of the Reparation Commission which were involved), they immediately met with the necessity for a Trustee to whom the payments in foreign currencies and Reichs-marks should be made by Germany, and by whom the distribution to the appropriate recipients should be managed.In the second place, the problems of mobilisation and commer-cialisation demanded a common centre of action and authority for
the purpose of co-ordinating and controlling the arrangements, and there were obvious advantages in such an authority being of a continuous or permanent character.In the third place, the continued existence of Deliveries in Kind necessitated special machinery of direction and control, at any rate for a period of years.They had already considered the desirability of an advisory com-mittee which could take any necessary action in connection with the declaration of a postponement on the postponable part of the annuity. A permanent central authority might include among its functions the convening of such an advisory body, international in character and existing as a constituent part of this central authority, to consider the situation which had brought about the necessity for a postponement, or the situation which a postpone-ment itself created.Again, the possibility that, either exceptionally or regularly as part of the plan, obligations would be discharged in marks within Germany necessitated a financial authority to arrange for the dis-fiosition of such funds or assets in the interests of the Creditors, by arrangement with the Eeichsbank or other German authority.Moreover, in so far as the task of transferring the payments into foreign currencies involved, besides a restriction of imports, an extension of German export trade, we envisaged the possibility of a financial institution that should be prepared to promote the increase of world trade by financing projects, particularly in un-developed countries, which might otherwise not be attempted through the ordinary existing channels.These several considerations led the Committee to the elabora-tion of a plan for a Bank for International Settlements, which should, in its various functions, meet all these points. The outline of this scheme is given in Section 6 and Annex I.It will be seen that the essential reparation functions of the Bank were such as to form a solid reason for its existence; but the Committee were led inevitably to add to those reasons the auxiliary, but none the less material, advantages that it might have in the general position of present international finance.Just as it had been difficult at the outset to table and discuss a precise programme of annuities under a new system until such a system were agreed in outline, because the amounts were them-selves dependent upon that system, so at this point in the dis-cussions it became difficult for various members to form definite opinions and commit themselves on all details as they were elaborated in the new system until a clearer idea of the obliga-tions that would be undertaken by Germany under that scheme had been obtained. Without, therefore, having resolved all points of doubt on the new system or done more than sketch it in broad outline, they found that the moment had arrived when the dis-cussion of figures became possible and necessary.
At this stage the following broad principles were understood to be likely to find their way into any final settlement :--(1) A division of the annuity into an unconditional and a postponable part.(2) The necessity for continuing deliveries in kind for a few -years.(3) The arrangement of suitable conditions for the post-ponable part in times of exceptional difficulty. In order to put the question into concrete terms, Memoranda were tabled by the Chairman, by the Experts of the four chief Creditor Countries, and by the German Experts. A considerable time was spent in discussing these proposals without agreement being reached. Finally the Chairman prepared a new and inde-pendent plan in which these divergent views were brought closer together. The main feature of his plan was an average annuity of 2,050.6 million Eeichsmarks; and, subject to certain reserves as to the matters of detail, this figure was accepted by the entire Committee, as the basis of further discussion, and led to the unanimous recommendations now put forward. Among those reserves is the question of the settlement of the Belgian Mark claim which the Committee had continually in contemplation and the unanimous agreement upon which is to be found in Annex VI.6. Bank for International Settlements.A. General Reasons for the Constitution of an Institution withBanking Functions.A general plan for a complete and final settlement of the repara-tion problem, being primarily financial in character, involves the performance of certain banking functions at one or more points in the sequence between the initial payment of the annuities and the final distribution of the funds. A banking institution designed to meet these requirements justifies and makes logical the liquidation-tion of all political controls and provides instead machinery essen-tially commercial and financial in character, which carries with it all the support and, at the same time, all the responsibilities that economic engagements imply. The process of removing the reparation problem from the political to the financial sphere which was begun in the Dawes Plan, will thus be carried a step further.In general terms, the institution will take over such functions of the existing agencies as it may be necessary to continue and will perform the whole work of external administration, such as the receipt and distribution of payments and the commercialisation of those parts of the annuities which are susceptible of being commercialised.The operations of the institution will be assimilated to ordinary commercial and financial practice. Its organisation will be outside the field of political influences and its powers and facilities will
be sufficiently broad to enable it to deal freely and promptly with the problems involved in the settlement of Germany&apos;s obligations. The institution will be equipped with machinery which will pro-vide an elastic element between the payments to be made by Germany and their realisation. In consequence, the Creditors will have further assurance that the effects of economic changes on the flow ofpayments will be minimised, and Germany for her part will have the possibility of assistance during temporarily unfavour-able conditions.It is obviosuly desirable, in the interest of obtaining results with the greatest efficiency, not to limit unduly the functions of the institution. The character of the annuities, and the magnitude-tude of the payments to be transferred over the exchanges, pro-vide at once the opportunity and the need for supplementing with additional facilities the existing machinery for carrying on inter-national settlements, and within limitations of the sound use of credit to contribute to the stability of international finance and the growth of world trade. We consider that by judicious non-competitive financial development the Bank should prove a useful instrument for opening up new fields of commerce, of supply and of demand; and will thus help to solve Germany&apos;s sj)Special problem, without encroaching on the activities of existing institutions.In designing the Plan for the Bank for International Settle-ments, which is given in outline in Annex I, we were therefore mindful of the fact that these new facilities should not supplant, but should augment and perfect existing arrangements for carry-ing through international settlements. The &apos;Bamk will have (a) as its essential or obligatory functions those which are iri-herent in the receipt, management and distribution of the annuities ; and (b) as its auxiliary or permissive functions those which evolve more indirectly from the character of the annuities. There is no hard and fast line between the two sets of functions, because the first lead naturally into second.B. Organisation of the Bank.In view of the part which the Bank will have to play in the general interest it is advisable to place the control of its manage-ment in the hands of the central banks, since these are the organisations responsible in each market for the convertibility of the national currencies and the control of credit.At the time of the Bank&apos;s constitution the capital will be geographically distributed in such a way as to associate in the Bank&apos;s working and in its development all the countries interested in the reparation settlement and all the financial markets which may subscribe to the Bank&apos;s issues,Provision is made for the utilisation of the net profits of the Bank, due allowance being made for the payment of cumulative
dividends on the capital stock, to create suitable reserve funds. Provision is also made, in case Governments or central banks make long-term deposits with the Bank, whereby they shall share proportionately in the remainder of the profits, after the require-in ents on account of dividends and the reserve funds have been covered.Inasmuch as its international basis is an essential feature which distinguishes the institution from all others, it has no single fiscal allegiance and it is desirable that in its movements in the various national markets it should not be hampered or restricted by con-siderations of relative fiscal burdens. It is therefore recom-mended that the Governments of the countries concerned enter into a convention for the avoidance of double and triple taxation of the Bank along the following lines : (a) the funds and investments of the bank to be freed from national taxation at the point where they derive interest, income and profit,(b) all individuals and corporations receiving profit, interest or income from the Bank to be fully liable thereon to such taxation as such individuals and corporations would attract if the profit interest or income were derived from any other source.(1) Capital. On the formation of the Bank its authorised capital will be in the equivalent of $100,000,000. The entire amount will be issued but only 25 per cent, of each share shall be called up, until the Board of Directors decides on a further call. The allocation of shares by countries is provided for in Section II of Annex I. The shares will carry no voting rights; but voting rights corresponding to the number of shares first issued in each country will be exercised by the central bank of that country in general meetings attended by representatives of those banks, taking the place of general meetings of shareholders.(2) Administration. The entire administrative control of the Bank will be vested in the Board of Directors. The functions of a Director of the Bank are incompatible with those involving national political responsibilites, and the statutes of the Bank will make the necessary provision in order to avoid such conflict of functions. All the Directors and candidates shall be ordinarily resident in Europe, or shall be in a position to give regular attendance at meetings of the Board.The Governor of the central bank of each of the seven countries to which members of the present Experts&apos; Committee belong, or his nominee, will be entitled to be a Director of the Bank ex officio. Each of these Governors may also appoint one Director, being a national of his country and representative either of finance or of industry or commerce. During the period of the German annuities the Governor of the Bank of France and the President
13162of the Eeichsbank may each appoint, if they so desire, one addi-tional Director of his own nationality, being a representative of industry or commerce. These fourteen (or, as the case may, sixteen) Directors will elect not more than nine additional Directors from lists furnished by, and which may include, the Governors of cenfral banks in other participating countries.If in the process of organising the Bank or in the performance of its functions after establishment, it is found that the central bank of any country or its Governor is unable to act officially or unofficially in exercising the functions, authorities or privileges accorded to central banks under the Plan, or refrains from doing so, alternative arrangements not inconsistent with the laws of that country will be made. These alternative arrangements are outlined in Section XII of Annex I.(3) Distribution of profits. The profits shall be divided in accordance with the provisions contained in Annex I.C. General observations on the Bank.The foregoing outline of the functions and organisation of the Bank for International Settlements, together with the fuller pre-sentation of the Bank Plan in Annex I largely speaks for itself. It remains, however, to point out certain advantages which the Bank offers as against the existing Reparation procedure, and which advantages accrue both to Germany and to the creditor countries, because the Bank in putting the payments on a business basis makes their receipts the more certain, and facilitates their movement. The new facilities introduced by the Bank are in addition to the provisions given elsewhere in the Plan whereby Germany is entitled to declare a postponement of transfer. They are rather in the nature of forestalling circumstances which might of themselves lead to a transfer postponement. These measures of prevention are of two general sorts; first, tbe Bank may employ its power of giving credit to arrange temporary assistance in trans-ferring the annuities; second, the Bank will be in a position, in agreement with the Reichsbank, to invest in Germany reichsmarks currently accruing to its account at the Reichsbank. This measure to the extent to which it may be utilised will return to the German economy a portion of the annuity, and through the Bank&apos;s credit mechanism provide the foreign exchange with which to pay the current allotments to the creditors on account of the annuity. The application of either or both of these measures is prompt and deci-sive, and they operate in advance of the time when difficulties present themselves rather than afterwards, and serve to ease any strain until such time as the discount rate and other corrective measures have had opportunity to exert themselves.It is not to be assumed that these two measures should be reserved for emergency use. The use of the Bank&apos;s credit by central banks within moderate limits, and over short periods may
in time become a normal function scarcely different in its exer-cise from the use of central bank credit by banks and bankers. All central banks, for ordinary exchange operations or for other purposes, would frequently find it advantageous to make use of the facility. The second measure, that of investing within Germany some portion of the annuity receipts, should also find its uses in normal times. Both measures are necessarily limited by the funds which the Bank will have at its disposal and by the requirement that it maintains its liquidity at all times.These are instances of the Bank&apos;s utility to Germany. They also illustrate the flexibility which the Bank&apos;s facilities give to the handling of the disbursements to the creditors. Further instances of joint benefit may be briefly indicated. The Bank will be able to give short-term and intermediate credit to purchasers of deliveries in kind, notably for the construction of public works on delivery-in-kind account. Intermediate credit operations need not be restricted, however, to any one country or to the purchase of anv one country&apos;s goods. On the contrary, it would be desirable to broaden such operations in the interest of world trade to the extent that the Directors of the Bank approve. As a stabilising factor in the foreign exchanges its advantages are obvious; and if in due time the arrangements provided for an international settlement fund are put into effective operation, the Bank should go far to eliminate the costs and risks now incurred in the shipping and re-shipping of gold.The Bank excludes from its procedure all political influences, and business principles and practice intervene to facilitate the settie-ment of Germany&apos;s obligations without in any way qualifying her independent and sole responsibility. The Office for Reparation Payments and its associated organisations in Berlin will be retired, and the Reparation Commission^ relations with Germany will be terminated. Germany will assume the responsibility for raising and transferring the annuities, and the Bank takes over the work of their receipt and disbursement.As already stated, the Bank is so designed as not to interfere with the functions performed by existing institutions, but it is to create for itself supplementary functions in a special field of its own. To this end every care should be exercised in the organisa-tion and administration of the institution.In the natural course of development, it is to be expected that the Bank will in time become an organisation, not simply, or even predominantly, concerned with the handling of reparations, but also with furnishing to the world of international commerce and finance important facilities hitherto lacking. Especially it is to be hoped that it will become an increasingly close and valuable link in the co-operation of Central Banking institutions generally  a co-operation essential to the continuing stability of the world&apos;s credit structure.
7._The Influence of the Form of the Annuity of the Amount.We are proposing a series of total annuities which should be paid with the regularity of the coupons of ordinary marketable bonds. But it is well recognised that to the economy of every country there may possibly come at some time or other a year of stress and diffiaulty. To make the economic scope of such a period the determinant of the maximum capacity in the ordinary course would be to fix a sum quite unacceptable to the Creditors and an unre-liable test of normal capacity to pay. It would be like fixing the standard of physical effort expected from a workman in his years of health and strength by what he is capable of doing in his occasional weeks of illness.While our proposals have made full allowance for all normal and long run considerations, it is possible that over exceptional and short periods the natural adjustments we contemplate might be insufficient. We have accepted the argument of the German Experts that, in undertaking a responsibility of this character identical in its nature with the solemn covenants of a debtor on a commercial and financial basis; Germany is well advised to con-sider carefully what are the limits of the burden which are possible for her final acceptance. We have therefore fully respected their scruples as to the undertakings they are prepared unconditionally to sign and have introduced a feature which can act as a safety valve, in time of difficulty, viz. : a right of postponement on Germany&apos;s initiative of the transfer (and, to a less degree, of pay-ment) of a portion of the annuity. The range between the two figures (the unconditional portion and the total annuity) is not to be taken as evidence of doubt as to Germany&apos;s capacity of transfer (or of payment); it represents rather the concession that has been made to the honourable determination of the German Experts not to make themselves unconditionally responsible for any obligation which&apos;they are not certain is within their power of performance in all circumstances. It is, however, to be emphasised that the total amount of the annuity proposed, while being far from covering the claims set forth by the Creditors, is one which they have every reason to believe can in fact be both paid and transferred by Germany. The fact that part of it is postponable obviates the danger of being above Germany&apos;s capacity to transfer in a period of difficulty, and it was the recognition of this principle which was one of the factors enabling the German Experts to accept this scheme as an alternative not inconsistent with their original ideas.In recommending that the system of Deliveries in Kind should be continued for a limited period and in decreasing amounts, we recognised, as is pointed out in Section 8 (/) of this Report, the necessity for maintaining a transitional period so that all shock to existing economic conditions in Germany should be avoided. Germany&apos;s power to transfer is thus maintained unimpeded by the friction of sudden changes in trade conditions.
8. Annuities.The Committee Recommends that (1) The Governments shall fix the exact date of termination of the Dawes Plan and the substitution therefor of the New Plan. In fixing such date, the Governments should bear in mind that this Committee&apos;s calculations were made on the basis that the Dawes Plan would cease on August 31, 1929, and the New Plan commence on September 1, 1929.In case the Governments should fix a date later than September 1st, 1929, it is recommended that financial adjustments shall be made so that the basis of payments provided for under the New Plan shall nevertheless commence as of September 1, 1929, and the basis of payments provided for under the Dawes Plan should cease as of August 31, 1929.(2) Payments under the Plan of the Dawes Committee should continue until the end of the present scheduled year, that is to say, August 31, 1929.(3) The New Plan should go into effect September 1, 1929, with the. value of the 37 annuities of 1988.8 million R.M. until March 31, 1966, the payments for the Dawes Loan to be added.(4) Payments to be made under the Dawes Plan, during the five months period preceding September 1, 1929, after allowing for the Dawes Loan should be treated as payments necessary to cover the requirements of the Creditor Nations during this transition period, including out payments for the year ending 31st March, 1930.Should there remain any surplus after meeting the foregoing requirements, the question of disposing of such surplus, as well as all matters and expenses in connection with the transition from the operation of the existing arrangements to the New Plan shall be settled and adjusted between the Governments.(5) In order that the new annuities shall coincide with the German fiscal years, the schedule of payments to be made by Germany on and from September 1, 1929, will be as follows : Million B.M.7 months36 German       J Fiscal years  ]1st Sept., 1929-31st March, 1930 1st April,  1930- 19311931- ,, 19321932- ,, 19331933- ,, 19341934- ,, 19351935- ,, 19361936- ,, 19371937- ,, 19381938- ,, 19391939- ,, 19401940  ,, 19411941- ,, 19421942- 1943742.8 1,707.9 1,685.0 1,738.2 1,804.3 1,866.9 1,892.9 1,939.7 1,977.0 1,995.3 2,042.8 2,155.5 2,180.7 2,198.0Constant annu-ity 37 years eor-responding to 1988.8.

However, we have not included the costs of Commissions and the current expenses of Occupation as they are to continue only until a date to be fixed by the Governments. The necessary arrangements for their payment should be made by the Governments, in connection with the adoption of the new Plan.Apart from the foregoing, we recommend that, as from the date of the putting into force of this Plan, Germany&apos;s previous obligation shall be entirely replaced by the obligation laid down in this Plan, and that the payment in full of the proposed annuities in accord-* Attention is called to the letter from the President of the Reichsbank given in Annex II.
ance with this Plan should be accepted by the Creditor Powers as a final discharge of all the liabilities of Germany, still remaining undischarged, referred to in Section XI of Part I of the Dawes Plan, as interpreted by the decisions already given by the Inter-pretation Tribunal set up under the London Agreement of the 30tli August, 1924. That&quot;Tribunal should be retained in existence and any dispute that may arise between Germany on the one side and the Creditor Governments or any one of them or the Bank on the other side, as to the extent of these liabilities or as to any other question of the interpretation or application of this Plan should be referred to it for final decision.In the course of their proceedings the Experts of the principal Creditor Powers have also dealt with the question of the distribu-tion of these Annuities among the Creditor Powers. Their recom-mendations, drawn up after careful examination of the existing distribution arrangements and of other relevant considerations laid before them and with due regard to the rights and equities of the other countries* having a share in the Dawes annuities, are set out in Annex VII which they consider an inseparable part of the present Report.COMPOSITION OE THE ANNUITIES. 8(a) Source and Securities.The annuities are to be derived from two sources :  1. The German Railway Company. 2. The Budget of the Reich.The Committee, after a careful examination of the proposals put forward by the German Experts, were of the opinion that the annuities recommended by them should not be drawn wholly from the G-erman Budget, but that one source-of payment utilised by the Dawes Plan, viz., the Railway Company, should be maintained. We desire to make it clear, however, that the retention of a contribution from the Railway Company is recommended not only&apos; from the point of view of security but also as a suitable method of raising the necessary revenue.We have also considered the position with regard to the assigned revenues, and having regard to the fact that these revenues are pledged as collateral security for the service of the German External Loan of 1924, we feel it is impossible to recommend their release thereof. Nevertheless we are of opinion that it would be suitable for the German Government to discuss with the Trustees for the Bondholders of that Loan the possibility of simplifying as far as possible the existing machinery, and that the creditor Governments for their part should accept a similar arrangement.   The effective* Greece, Portugal, Poland, Roumania, Serbia, Japan and the United States of America.
security of the creditor Governments should be substantially that indicated in Annex III (Section III).Apart from these special questions, the Committee desires to record its view that the basis of security for the payment of the annuities is the solemn undertaking of the German Government, to which no further guarantee can add anything whatsoever.The Committee accordingly recommends that the creditor Governments should take steps to release all controls, special securi-ties, pledges or charges which may remain in their hands other than those specifically referred to above, and should recognise that their acceptance of the solemn undertaking of the German Govern-ment replaces any securities, pledges, charges or controls as may now exist.2. The Contribution from the German Railway Company.  Under the German Railway Law of 30th August, 1924, enacted in accordance with the Dawes Plan, the German Railway Company is subject to a mortgage for eleven milliard g.m., in favour of the Trustee for the German Railway Bonds, and has issued to him a bond for eleven milliard g.m. This bond bears interest at 5 per cent, per annum, and carries a cumulative sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum, which first became operative on 1st September, 1927 ; interest and sinking fund being guaranteed by the Govern-ment of the Reich.The Plan contemplates the abolition of the Railway Bonds, together with the attendant circumstances of foreign participation in the management of the Railway, and substitutes a contribution from the Railway Company, as set out in the following para-graphs : The Railway Company shall be under an obligation to pay for 37 years a direct tax, comprising if necessary the transport tax, to an annual amount of 660 million R.QVI. being equal to the annual amount of the non-postponable annuity. This tax shall be imposed by German legislation, and the receipts therefrom guaranteed by the German Government. The Railway Company shall deposit with the Bank for International Settlements a Certificate acknowledging its liability in respect of this obligation.The amount payable shall be raised from the gross revenues of the Company, ranking after the expenditure on personnel, and on the same footing with expenditure on material and consumable stores. It shall enjoy priority over any other tax now levied on the Railway Company, or which may be levied in the future, and shall rank prior to any other charge, by way of mortgage or other-wise, on the Company. It shall be paid direct by the Railway Company to the account of the Bank for International Settlements at the Reichsbank in instalments as laid down in Part 8.The foregoing conditions shall be incorporated in the law govern-ing the Railway Company.
It shall be one of the duties of the Organisation Committee pro-posed in Annex V of this Report to make suitable provision whereby the private and independent character of the German Railway Company, including its autonomous administration in economic, financial and personnel matters shall continue for the period of the Plan without interference from the German Government.3. The Transport Tax. In addition to the 660 million gold marks now payable directly by the Railway Company, the Dawes Plan requires a contribution to the standard annuity of 290 million gold marks out of the actual yield of the transport tax. This tax is imposed by the German Government, and the German Railway Company collects it for the Government. The total yield of the transport tax, now considerably in excess of 290 million gold marks appears among the receipts of the Budget of the Reich, and the contribution of 290 millions appears among its expenditures. Under this Plan the direct tax on the Railway Company comprises if necessary the transport tax which is otherwise relieved from any special charge on account of reparations.4. The charge on German Industries. Under the Industrial Charges Law enacted in accordance with the Dawes Plan, bonds aggregating five milliard gold marks have been issued in respect of the German industries by the Bank for German Industrial Deben-tures, to the Trustee for the German Industrial Debentures. These bonds bear interest at 5 per cent, per annum and carry a cumulative sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum, which first became opera-tive 1st September, 1927; principal, interest and sinking fund being guaranteed by the Government of the Reich. The present contribution to the annuity from the Industrial Debentures thus, amounts to 300 million gold marks.This particular charge in no way differs from ordinary taxation save in the complications it involves in legislation and the machinery of collection. We recommend that it be discontinued, and that its disappearance be taken into account in distributing the relief from taxation which this plan will enable the German Government to bring into effect.5. The charge on the Budget of the Reich. Under the Dawes Plan, the contribution from the Budget of the Reich in the fifth or current annuity year, amounts to 1,250 million gold marks, or one-, half of the total standard annuity. This contribution is a charge on the Budget as a whole specifically secured by the assignment of the revenues from Customs, beer, tobacco, sugar and alcohol to the Commissioner of Controlled Revenues. These revenues are paid by the collecting Offices directly into the account of the Com-missioner at the Reichsbank. As early as practicable in each month, out of the funds accumulated in his account, the Commis-sioner pays into the account of the Agent-General at the Reichs-bank one-twelfth of the annual contribution from the budget and thereafter in each month the revenues are automatically trans-
ferred by him to the account of the German Government at the Reichsbank. Under this plan the procedure to be followed will be worked out in detail, by the appropriate organisation committee proposed in Annex V, regard being had so far as necessary, to the arrangement which may be accepted by the Trustees of the 1924 loan.As the amount contributed by the German Railway continues for 37 years at the fixed level of 660 million R.M. a year, the charge on the Budget of the Reich varies with the total amount of the annuity. In the second year it stands at the figure of 1,136,400,000 R.M., and rises to a maximum of 1,768,800,000 R.M. in the 37th year. Thereafter the contribution from the Railway Company ceases, the annuity falls sharply and the Budget con-tribution covers the whole of the German liability for the remainder of the Plan.The average increase in the budgetary contribution during the first 20 years is about 24 million R.M. annually, or about .2-1 of 1 per cent, of the total revenues of the budget of the Reich, which at present are just under ten milliards. This moderate and gradual increase in the budgetary contribution under the definitive settlement plan ought to be met in ordinary years without recourse to additional taxation. Indeed, the substantial reduction of the budgetary contribution as compared with the Dawes Plan makes possible an immediate resumption of the tax reduction programme which has been in progress since 1924. The Committee hope that such further tax reductions, coupled with a definitive reparation settlement, will give a strong stimulus to saving and thereby mate-rially assist in the internal formation of the new capital which Germany still requires.8 (b) Progression.The authors of the Dawes Plan believed that they could count upon a certain, substantial and progressive increase in the prosperity of Germany, arising not only from the employment of the rapidly increasing wealth of that country, but also from the steady pro-gress of world prosperity, and this belief found expression in the device of an Index of Prosperity. The Plan contemplates that the amounts which Germany pays upon a fixed scale shall increase, generally speaking, year by year until 1966, reflecting in some small measure this anticipated increase in her prosperity. How-ever, the annuities proposed are to start at a level which not only gives immediate and important relief to the German Budget, to her exchange position and to her need for additional internal formation of capital, as compared with the Standard Dawes Annuity of 2,500 million g.m., but also provides the greatest possible assurance that the new scheme will function from the beginning without any hitch or disturbance.
8 (c) The Non-Postponable Annuities.Not the least difficult part of the task was the determination of the figure which Germany could immediately undertake as a final and unconditional obligation. The point at which difficulties might begin to arise in making transfers into foreign currencies is not exactly definable in advance; but every care has been taken to be so far within this &quot;limit as to remove every possibility of the risk of error. We recognise that in fixing the figure payable by Ger-many in foreign currencies, without any right of postponement whatever, at 660 million R..M., we have taken a conservative amount. But we are satisfied that it is wiser deliberately to under-estimate than to run the slightest risk of weakening German Credit by proposing a figure which might not command instant acceptance by well-informed public opinion.8 (d) The Postponable Annuities.In addition to the unconditional part of the Annuity, we pro-post a postponable part, transfer of which may in certain circum-stances, set out below, be postponed for a period not exceeding two years.This postponable part of the annuity is designed to meet the situation which might arise in a period of special economic diffi-culty and distress. There will be other ways of meeting such a situation, and if they are applied our view is that recourse to this abnormal measure will not in fact prove to be necessary. Nevertheless, as an additional precaution, it is valuable to Ger-niany, and provides, by its very existence, a safeguard against the dangers which too rigid a framework might have called into existence. &apos;8 (e) Measures of Safeguard.The essence of the additional margin of safety given to a part of the annuities lies in the power to postpone transfer. We are recommending, in order to protect Germany against the possible consequence of a comparatively short period of depression, which might, for internal or external reasons, put such a severe strain on the exchanges as would make the process of transfer abroad dangerous, that the German Government should have the right, on giving 90 days&apos; notice, to postpone transfers for a period not exceeding two years under conditions set out in Annex IV. During the period of postponement, the liability of the German Govern-ment with regard to the sums affected would in the first instance be limited to payment in Eeichsmarks to the account at the Reichs-bank of the Bank for International Settlements; under certain conditions, part of this payment, may also be withheld.
Upon the declaration of any postponement the Bank for Inter-national Settlements shall convene the Special Advisory Com-mittee. At any other time, when the German Government declare to the Creditor Governments and to the Bank for International Settlements that they have come to the conclusion in good faith that Germany&apos;s exchange and economic life may be seriously endangered by the transfer in part or in full of the postponable portion of the annuities, the Committee shall also be convened.Upon being convened, the Special Advisory Committee shall forthwith consider the circumstances and conditions which have led up to the necessity for postponement, or have created a situa-tion in which Germany considers that her exchange and economic life may be seriously endangered by further transfers of the post-ponable portion of the annuity and make a full investigation of Germany&apos;s position in regard to her obligations under this Plan.In their report to the Governments and to the Bank, having (in case of a postponement of transfer) satisfied themselves that the German authorities have used every effort in their power to fulfil their obligations, they shall indicate for consideration by the Governments and the Bank what in their opinion are the measures that should be taken in regard to the application of the present Plan.It shall further be the duty of the Bank during a postponement of transfer to direct, in conjunction with the Reichsbank, the employment of the Reichsmarks paid to its account at the Reichs-bank by the German Government. (See Section VI of Annex I to this Report.)The following paragraphs sketch the organisation of the Special Advisory Committee of the Bank for International Settlements, referred to in the preceding paragraphs : 1. The Committee shall act in a purely consultative capacity. Its findings shall have no effective force unless confirmed and accepted by the Bank as Trustee of the Creditors, and if necessary by the Governments concerned.2. The Committee shall play no part in connection with the unconditional annuity accepted by Germany and referred to in the Plan as the &apos;&apos; unconditional annuity &apos;&apos;.3. The Committee shall be convened by the Bank according to the rules of its own constitution when notice shall be received from the German Government. It shall not be required to meet at any other time.4. The Committee shall consist of seven ordinary and four co-opted Members. The ordinary Members shall be nominated one by each of the following : 
The Governors of :  The Reichsbank, The Banque de France, The Bank of England, The Banque Nationale de Belgique, The Banca dTtalia, The Bank of Japan,A Federal Reserve Bank of the United States or some other agreed American financial institution, in fhe last two cases, such nominee being ordinarily resident in Europe or in a position to give prompt attendance on a meeting of the Committee being called. These nominees of the Governors of the Banks shall not be officially connected with the banking institutions in question nor with the Govern-ment departments of their respective countries. After being summoned they may, if they so desire, co-opt not more than four additional members with the intent that special aspects, whether in finance, exchange, industry, etc., of the particular situation in question shall be represented. During the course of the proceedings and until the report is made, the co-opted members shall be equal in all other respects to the ordinary members, but they shall thereafter be discharged from office.5. The Committee may proceed by way of hearing evidence or asking for documents, as it may desire, but the President of the Reichsbank and/or any other person nominated by the German Government may appear before or submit to the Committee the reasons for which a postponement has been declared or measures are desirable as indicated above.The Committee shall neither grant nor refuse a postpone-ment. After making enquiry, it shall report to the Govern-ments and the Bank as indicated above.6. Unless otherwise arranged by consent the expenses of the Special Advisory Committee shall be borne by the German Government.8 (/) Deliveries in Kind.The system of deliveries in kind under the Dawes Plan has come to play an important role in the economic life of Germany. We would not suggest the unlimited continuation of this system, which is open to many objections of a practical as well as a theoretical nature. We have felt, however, that its immediate cessation would not be in the interests of Germany or of the creditor Powers, and that it would impose difficulties upon the export trade of Germany which might be injurious to her capacity to transfer. We therefore recommend that the principles of the Dawes Plan, with reference to deliveries in kind, should continue in existence for a limited period, and that the Creditor Nations should agree for a period of 10 years to absorb by this means, in respect of
each year, a limited and decreasing amount of the postponable portion of the annuity, substantially in accordance with the follow-ing table :- Millions.....   7501st year............... 7003rd year ...      ............... 6Q05tk year............... .5006th year.........      ...... 4507th year ...      ............. &quot;    4008th year ...       .........      ..... &apos;     gg09th year.................. &quot;.&quot;   30010th year .........The foregoing table to be adapted to the actual annuities of the new Plan without increasing the total.The Creditor Powers by arrangements effected among themselves will fix the proportions in the total of each year&apos;s volume of deliveries in kind (including deliveries under Reparation Recovery Acts or any equivalent system substituted therefor by agreement up to 23.05 per cent, for Great Britain and 4.95 per cent, for France of the total amount provided for each year) which each of them will receive.The Bank for International Settlements shall manage the dis-bursements on deliveries in kind account, and in making distribu-tions of cash to the Creditor countries shall have due regard for those portions of the annuity which are restricted to payments for deliveries in kind.The Committee also recommends that new Regulations be adopted by the Governments modifying the Wallenberg Regula-tions to conform to the new Plan and, so far as practicable, simpli-fying and liberalising them.The Committee recommends that provision be made in the new Regulations permitting the several Powers to dispose of some part of their respective quotas of deliveries outside of their own terri-tories under suitable restrictions.The proposed repartition of the deliveries in kind among the several Creditor Powers is contained in Annex V1T dealing with Repartition of the Annuities.9. Liquidation of the Past.In order to arrive as rapidly as possible at a general liquidation of the financial questions raised by the war and the subsequent Treaty of Peace, a liquidation which alone can ensure the definite return of Europe to normal financial and economic conditions, the Committee recommends the clearing up of these questions in a broad spirit of mutual concession.
27163We understand that a settlement on those lines will render obsolete the accounts between the Reparation Commission and Germany relating to transactions prior to the period of the Dawes Plan together with all accounts involving credits against the original capital debt. We are strongly of opinion that these accounts should^be closed at the earliest moment.The Creditor Governments under this Plan will be reducing the whole body of their claims arising out of the war or under the Treaty of Versailles to a considerable extent. The Experts of the Creditor countries are aware that past transactions have given or may give rise to claims by Germany, some of which are still unsettled, and while they are not able to go into the merits of these claims, they consider that the Creditor Governments are fully entitled to expect that Germany should waive them, in considera-tion of the consolidation of the Creditors&apos; claims at a reduced figure. Any other course would be inconsistent with their inten-tion that, just as the new Annuities cover all the claims denned in Part XI of the Dawes Plan, so they should be paid free of deduction in respect of any past transactions. The Committee recognises however that this is entirely a matter for the Govern-ments to deal with.To assure the general confidence indispensable for the successful working of this plan the Committee recommends that the Govern-ments make no further use, from the date of the acceptance of this report, of their right to seize, retain and liquidate property, rights and interests of German nationals or companies controlled by them in so far as not already liquid or liquidated or finally dis-posed of, and that the outstanding questions concerning such pro-perty should be definitely cleared up within one year after the coming into force of this plan by arrangements between the Governments concerned and Germany. This recommendation naturally has no application in cases where special settlements have already been made.The acceptance of this Plan necessarily involves the dissolution of the joint liability of Germany on the one side with Austria Hungary and Bulgaria on the other side for reparation and there-fore finally abolishes every obligation present or future in either direction which may result between these Powers from this joint liability.The Committee recommends in particular that the Creditor Powers should abstain from recovering the credits of Germany against her ex-allies referred to in Art. 261 of the Treaty of Ver-sailles, Germany for her part renouncing any net balance which might be due to her as a result of these credits.In their unanimous desire that the remaining financial questions arising out of the war should be settled as soon as possible, in order to promote the spirit of international harmony and collabora-
tion, the Experts unanimously recommend to the Creditor Govern-ments that within the first year of operation of the new Plan, they complete the work of the Experts&apos; Committee by dealing with and disposing of the claims and debts for ceded properties and liberation bonds, held in the hands of the Reparation Commission against the so-called Succession States. This question is referred to in Annex VII.10. Commercialisation and Mobilisation.Having recommended the creation of the Bank for International Settlements in order to provide machinery for the removal of the Reparation obligation from the political to the financial sphere, we have further considered what procedure is necessary in order to assimilate this obligation as closely as possible to an ordinary commercial obligation (&quot; commercialisation &quot;).Further, certain Governments are known to attach particular importance to the possibility of raising money by the issue to the public of Bonds representing the capitalisation of the uncondi-tional portion of the Annuity (&quot; mobilisation &quot;).It is of course not within our power to advise as to the time at which such issues can be made with advantage, or as to the terms and conditions on which issues should be made. The arrange-ments to be made would no doubt vary according as, for example, an issue is to be made for cash in the general interest of all the Creditor Governments, or an internal issue is to be made in one single country by way of conversion of Government Debt. It will be the province of the Bank itself to advise upon such matters; but we have thought it necessary to advise a framework within which these operations may take place.This framework is given in Annex III. It provides first that the Annuities themselves shall be represented by a German Govern-ment certificate of indebtedness deposited with the Bank, similar to those in use in ordinary commercial practice (a proper distinc-tion being made in the coupons between the conditional and uncon-ditional portions of the Annuity). The provisions regarding security are given in the Annex and the conditions in which mobilisable Bonds should be created and issued are defined.One of the most important provisions of this scheme is that annuity moneys should be distributed by the Bank in strict pro-portion to the rights of each party whether Government or bond-holder.As far as according to the conditions of the issue reparation loans (general or conversion loans) are subject to an anticipated redemption, Germany should be entitled to redeem these loans; the part of the annuity destined for the service of the redeemed loan will then accrue to her. The wish has been expressed that so far as possible reparation loans will not be issued without granting the debtor an appropriate right of anticipated redemption.
We recommend that Germany should also have the right to redeem all or any part of not yet mobilised annuities on a basis of 51 per cent, discount.11. The New Plan contrasted with the Dawes Plan. The Dawes Plan, although drawn up at a time of intense crisis, has by a test lasting over nearly five years, justified by facts the postulates on which it was based as regards both the restoration of the public finances of Germany and her economic recovery.It may be well to summarise briefly the points of advantage  whether to Germany or her Creditors claimed for the new pro-prosal, which justify a departure from a scheme that has in the past rendered signal service.The plan drawn up by the Committee to afford a definite solu-tion of the Reparation question accompanies a reduction in the existing obligation of Germany by an essential modification in their financial and political status. In so far as the creditors are relinquishing substantial advantages in the face value of payments due under the Dawes Plan, they are doing so only by reason of those improvements in intrinsic and available values which arise from the practicability and certainty of commercialisation and mobilisation within a reasonable period and in its attendant financial and economic psychology.Among the modifications, which are considered specially important are the following : (1) Fixation of the period and the debt.The Dawes Plan imposes in virtue of the Index of Pros-perity increasing annuities, of which the number are not fixed. The new programme indicates a definite number of fixed annuities.(2) Disappearance of the Index of Prosperity.Only estimates, which vary very widely, of the ultimate effect of the Index of Prosperity can at this date be made. But in no circumstances could Germany benefit therefrom, and the disappearance of this element of uncertainty is wholly to her benefit.(3) Attainment of financial autonomy.Under the Dawes Plan Germany can only obtain the dis-charge of her obligations in marks by the existence of a system of transfer protection which involves a measure of external control. This brings attendant limiting effects on German credit and financial independence which render difficult, if not impossible, any mobilisation of the German debt. The new plan would be abandoning the fundamental purposes for which it was intended if it did not cancel this clause and leave to Germany the obligation of facing her engagements on her own untrammelled responsibility.
(4) Postponement safeguards.Nevertheless, if an exceptional emergency interrupts the normal course of economic life to which the scheme is adapted, Germany can, on her own initiative, resort to certain measures of temporary relief.The annuity is divided into two parts, of which one is subject to postponement of transfer and payment. Germany will thus be enabled under certain circumstances temporarily to relieve her balance of payments, and will in fact enjoy the advantages, of a form of transfer protection without its attendant limitations.(5) Deliveries.While the Dawes Plan reluctantly accepted the expedient of deliveries in kind, the new Plan, in spite of the desire of the creditor Powers to dispose freely of their shares of the annuities, recognise the undesirability of a sudden cessation of the system at present in force. The creditors are there-fore to take deliveries in kind for ten years, but in decreasing amounts beginning with 750 millions.(6) Mobilisation.From the point of view of the creditor Powers an essential feature of the new Plan which induces them to agree to reduc-tion on their claims that leave them burdened with a con-siderable part of their expenditure for the damages caused by the war, is the fact that the annuity is paid in a form&apos; lending itself to mobilisation.(7) Financial organisation.The organisation and machinery of the Dawes Plan were based on the conviction that it must find its proper guarantee in the interest of all parties to carry it out in good faith. In aiming as it did at the transference of the Reparation pay-ments from the political to the economic and business sphere, it presumed constant co-operation of debtor and creditors alike. The new system goes further along the same road, replacing the collaboration of separate administrative and governmental organisation by common work in a purely finan-cial institution, in the management of which Germany is to have an appropriate part. The present administrative organisations cannot have all the elasticity necessary for bank-ing transactions of the magnitude of the payment and transfer of the annuities; but the new Bank in close association with the banks of issue and with the Banking facilities at its command will have all the necessary means of effecting these operations without disturbance to the German economy or to the economy of other countries.     In addition it will be
in a position to open up to trade new possibilities of develop-ment. The operations which it is to undertake cannot be disturbed or hampered without irreparable damage to the credit of the countries concerned. This assurance should make it possible to limit the guarantees established under the present system for the protection of the rights of the creditors, to the minimum required for the prompt and facile commer-cialisation of the mobilisable part of the annuity.(8) Summary.The proposed plan continues and completes the work begun by the Dawes Plan, which the position alike if Germany and of the other countries made it impossible to do more than indicate in outline in 1924. By the final reduction and fixation of the German debt, by the establishment of a pro-gressive scale of annuities, and by. the facilities which the new Bank offers for lessening disturbance in the payment of the annuities, it sets the seal on the inclusion of the German debt in the list of international settlements. If it involves appreciable reduction in payments to the creditor countries on what might have been anticipated under the continued operation of the Dawes Plan, it at the same time eliminates the uncertainties which were inherent in that Plan and were equally inimical to the interest of the debtor and to the creditors, by substituting a definite settlement under which the debtor knows the exact extent of his obligations.12.-Conclu sion s. It has been our object to make proposals for financial obligations, which, with the conditions and safeguards that accompany them, shall be within Germany&apos;s capacity to pay, and we believe that we have achieved this purpose. We realise the responsibility of this declaration, and we recognise how much depends on the future attitude towards one another of the peoples which, by ratification of then: respective governments, are to become parties to this agreement. For the solution of the Reparation problem is not only a German task but in the common interest of all the countries con-cerned; and it requires the co-operation of all parties. If their attitude should be tinged with antagonism, even with suspicion, or a desire to create or continue one-sided economic discriminations, a settlement perfectly feasible with goodwill would sooner or later encounter difficulties, so that the long, slow, patient task of recon-struction in Europe, would be definitely retarded. For without good faith and mutual confidence all agreements, all guarantees are unavailing. If, on the other hand, our proposals are adopted with goodwill by all concerned, and the rest of the world has con-fid ence in the constructive value of this mutual accord, then indeed there can be no reasonable doubt that the agreement will be capable
of complete fulfilment, and the nations it concerns will be brought to a higher level of economic stability and of mutual understanding than ever before.Finally, we would point out, like our predecessors on the Dawes Committee that &quot; We regard our report as an indivisible whole. It is not possible, in our opinion, to achieve any success by selecting certain of our recommendations for adoption and rejecting the others, and we would desire to accept no responsibility for the results of such a procedure nor for undue delay in giving execution to our Plan.&quot;Paris, June 7th, 1929.SUGGESTED OUTLINE FOE THE ORGANISATION  OF THE BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS.In Section ni of the following outline, provision is made for an Organisation Committee, which will have the duty of putting the Bank project into effect. This outline has been drawn up for the benefit of the Organisation Committee, which will have power generally to modify its provisions or to make substitutions for any or all of them; provided always that such modifications or sub-institutions shall not be inconsistent with the essential functions of the Bank with respect to the Experts&apos; Plan as a whole.The Bank organised under this Plan shall be known as the &quot; Bank for International Settlements &quot;.The purpose of the Bank is to provide additional facilities for the international movement of funds, and to afford a ready instrument for promoting international financial relations. In connection with the German reparation annuities, it shall perform as trustee for the creditor countries the entire work of external administration of this Plan, shall act as the agency for the receipt and distribution of funds; and shall supervise and assist in the commercialisation and mobilisation of certain portions of the annuities.Erancqui.

Lamont.I.-Purpose, Name and Location.
It shall be located in a financial centre hereafter to be designated. In selecting the country of incorporation due consideration shall be given to obtaining powers sufficiently broad to enable it to perform its functions with requisite freedom and with suitable immunities from taxation.II. Shake Capital.The authorised capital of the Bank may be expressed in the currency of the country of domicile, and shall amount to the round equivalent of $100,000,000. Upon the formation of the Bank the wiiole authorised capital shall be issued, but only 25 per cent, of each share shall be then paid in. The Board of Directors of the Bank shall have power to call for the payment of further in-stalments; it shall also have the power to authorise an increase or a reduction in the total capital stock of the Bank.In each country in which the shares of the Bank may be offered for sale, the shares shall be issued through the central bank of that country or other agency to which the central bank offers no objection. In the seven countries to which members of the present committee belong, issues or allocations of shares shall always be made in equal amounts. The central banks of these countries, or banking groups not objected to by them, shall guarantee the subscription of the whole of the first issue in the round equivalent of $100,000,000; but they may agree with central banks or groups in other countries (particularly those interested in reparations) that an amount of the first issue not exceeding the round equivalent of $4,000,000 for each, and not exceeding the round equivalent of $44,000,000 in all, may be issued in other countries.In the event of an increase in the authorised capital and a further issue of shares, the distribution among countries shall be decided by a two-thirds majority of the Directors of the Bank on the above principles. In particular, the percentage of the total shares issued in the seven countries first mentioned above shall not fall below 55.Apart from countries interested in reparations only countries which have, at the time an offering of shares is made, currency stabilised on a gold or gold exchange basis may participate.The shares may be expressed in the currency of the country in which the Bank is domiciled and shall state the amount of the share at the gold mint parity of the currency of the country in which they are issued; they shall be registered and continue to be registered, but may be freely negotiated. Transfers of the shares after issue shall not affect the voting power reserved to the central banks as described below. Payments to the shareholders on account of dividends or at the liquidation of the Bank shall be made in the currency of the country of domicile.The shares shall carry no voting rights; but voting rights corre-sponding to the number of shares originally issued in each country 4719 B
shall be exercised by the central bank of that country in the general meetings of the Bank (taking the place of the general meetings of shareholders), which the representatives of the participating central banks will attend.The shares shall be entitled to participate in the profits of*the Bank as indicated in the section &quot; Distribution of profits &quot;.III. Organisation Committee.For the purpose of taking the preliminary steps for putting the Bank project into effect a temporary Committee shall be created which will be known as the &quot; Organisation Committee &quot;. This committee shall be appointed by the Governors of the central banks of the seven countries to which members of the present committee belong. The Governor of each of these seven central banks shall be entitled to designate two members of the Organisation Com-mittee with due regard for the necessity of including in its member-ship persons versed in banking, the issue of bonds ana1 the work of the present Committee of Experts. If for any reason, the Governor of any of these central banks shall be unable officially or un-officially to designate members of the Organisation Committee, or refrains from doing so, the Governors of the remaining central banks shall invite two fellow-nationals of the Governor not participating, to act as members of the Committee. The members thus selected shall have in all respects an equal vote in the work of the committee with the members otherwise chosen. The decisions of the Organisation Committee shall be taken by a three-quarters vote.As an essential part of its work the Organisation Committee shall proceed with drawing up a charter for the Bank, which shall be consistent with the provisions of the Plan, and shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure its timely granting or enact-ment by appropriate public authorities.The Organisation Committee shall, until such time as the Board of Directors of the Bank is appointed and takes office, proceed witli the physical organisation of the Bank. It shall arrange, in accord-ance with the procedure prescribed in Section II, for the subscription of the capital stock, and in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Section TV, for the appointment of the Board of Directors. It shall call the first meeting of the Board of Directors, and designate the temporary Chairman to preside at that meeting pending the election of the regular chairman. It shall draw up the statutes for regulating the administration of the Bank and submit them to the Board of Directors for consideration. These statutes shall make provision for such matters as are usual in banking organisation and in particular provide for the following : &apos;(1) The qualifications for membership on the Board of Directors.
(2) The nature and duties of the permanent committees of the Board of Directors, including the Executive Committee.(3) The administrative departments to be created within the Bank.(4) The time and place of the meetings of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Committee.(5) The form to be used for the convocation of the General Meeting, as well as the conditions and the methods for exercising voting rights on the part of representatives of central banks.(6) The form of trust certificates which the Bank shall issue to the creditor Governments under the Plan.(7) Provisions with regard to liquidation of the Bank.The Organisation Committee shall cooperate with the organisation committees provided for in this Plan.IV. Directorate and Management.The entire administrative control of the Bank shall be vested in the Board of Directors whose duty it shall be to supervise and direct the operations of the Bank and in general so to act as to carry out those purposes of the Plan committed to the administration of the Bank.  In particular, the Board of Directors :  (1) Shall have the right to adopt, modify, limit or extend the statues of the Bank in such a manner as shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.(2) Shall have the power generally to modify the provisions contained in the outline of the Bank&apos;s organisation or to make substitutions for any or all of them, provided always that such modifications or substitutions shall not be inconsistent with the essential functions of the Bank with respect to the Experts&apos; Plan as a whole and with its existing engagements.(3) Shall appoint the chief executive officer of the Bank, and fix his remuneration.(4) May appoint an Executive Committee and delegate such powers to it as may be provided for in the statutes of the Bank.(5) May appoint advisory committees to deal with any questions upon which information or advice is desired.The functions of a director are incompatible with those in-volving national political responsibilities. The statutes of the Bank shall make the necessary provision in order to avoid such conflict of functions. All the directors shall be ordinarily resident in Europe or shall be in a position to give regular attendance at meet-ings of the Board.47-1 0
- The Board of Directors shall be made up in the following manner:- r&apos; :! (1) The Governor (or as the case may be, the chief executive officer) of the central bank of each of the seven countries to which members of the present committee belong, or his nominee, shall be a director of the Bank ex-officio. Bach of these governors shall also appoint one director, being a national of his country and representative either of finance or of industry or commerce. In case the Governor of any central bank shall be unable to act either officially or unofficially according to the provisions of this paragraph, or refrains from doing so, action shall then be taken in accordance with the alternative pro-cedure given in Section XII of this outline.(2) During the period of the German annuities the Governor of the Bank of France and the President of the Reichsbank may each appoint, if they so desire, one additional director of his own nationality, being a representative of industry or com-merce.(3) The Governor of the central bank of each of the other countries participating in the share ownership of the Bank as provided in Section II of this outline, shall furnish a list of four candidates of his own nationality for directorships. Two of the candidates on each list shall be representative of finance and the other two of industry or commerce. The Governors in question may themselves be included in this list. From these lists the fourteen or sixteen directors mentioned in para-graphs (1) and (2) above shall elect not more than nine other directors.(4) From those first appointed, four groups of five directors shall be chosen by lot; their terms respectively shall end at the close of each of the first, second, third and fourth years from the establishment of the Bank. Subject to this the term of office of the directors shall be five years, but they may be re appointed.(5) In case of vacancy in a position oh the Board of Directors arising from death, resignation or other causes, the vacancy shall be filled in the same manner as prescribed for- original appointments.   If a vacancy occurs before the expiration of a term, it shall be filled for the remainder of the term only. The Directors shall elect a Chairman annually from among their own number.   The Chairman&apos;s duties shall be to preside at meet-ings of the Board of Directors.     At the first meeting, until the Chairman shall have been elected, a member of the Board selected for the purpose by the Organisation Committee shall act as Chair-man.The ordinary decisions of the Board, including those involving-elections, shall be made by a simple majority vote.   In case of an
even division the Chairman shall have a deciding vote. For decisions involving the adoption or amendment of statutes of the Bank, modifications or substitutions in the present project for the organisation of the Bank, the distribution among countries of addi-tional issues of stock in the Bank, or other matters for which the statutes of the Bank make appropriate provision, a two-thirds majority shall be required. .Should a member not be able to attend a meeting of the Board, it will always be open to him to empower one of his colleagues, by registered letter or by telegram, to vote for him and on his behalf.If decisions of the Board are disputed on the ground that they are inconsistent with the provisions or intent of the Plan, recourse may be had to arbitration under the procedures laid down in Part 8 of the Plan.The chief executive officer of the Bank shall select the officers and heads of the departments of the Bank. For the latter the appointments shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.V. Deposits.The Bank,&apos; in carrying out its functions with respect to the facilitation of international settlements or in connection with the German annuities, shall have the right to receive deposits of a nature consistent therewith. The Board of Directors, or, as it may decide, the Executive Committee, shall consider application to open deposit accounts, with authority to determine whether such applications come within the scope of the Bank&apos;s functions. Deposits shall be received in only those currencies which satisfy in the opinion of the Board of Directors the practical requirements of the gold or gold-exchange standard.Any classification of deposits which the Board of Directors may set up shall include : (1) Deposits on annuity account. These deposits the Bank receives in its capacity as Trustee for the creditor Govern-ments. They shall be managed according to the procedure given in Section VIII of this outline.(2) Deposits from central banks. These may be either current account deposits or investment account deposits.(3) Deposits on clearing account. The Bank shall have the right subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may set down, to accept deposits from central banks for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a fund for settling accounts among them. Such deposits may take the form of gold deliveries at the counters of the Bank or of gold held for its account under earmark by any central bank par-participating in the fund for clearing accounts. The terms under which central banks may enter the clearing system, the rules ^ and regulations for its operation, and the rates of exchange4749
at which gold is to be accepted as deposits in the clearing fund or to be withdrawn from it, shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Bank.(4) Deposits originating in the exercise of the Bank&apos;s func-tions in connection with the German annuities, and tending to facilitate such functions. No such account shall be opened without the assent of the central bank of the country of which the prospective depositor is a national. If the Governor of the central bank in question (or his nominee) is present and voting at the time the Board of Directors (or the Executive Committee) of the Bank authorises the opening of the account, his favourable vote shall be taken as giving the required assent.(5) Deposits constituting guarantee funds, as provided in Annex VIII and relative to the mobilisation of the uncon-ditional annuity. The interest and the share in the profits which will apply to these deposits are provided for in Annex VIII and in the section on Profits in this outline.(6) Special deposit of the German Government. During the first 37 years the German Government shall maintain at the Bank a non-interest-bearing deposit equivalent to 50 per cent, of the average deposit remaining in the Annuity Trust Account, as described in Section VIII of this outline. This German Government deposit will not exceed 100 million Reichsmarks.The Bank shall have the right to pay interest on deposits, but only on deposits not susceptible of withdrawal until at least one month from the time of deposit. The rate of interest to be paid will be determined by the Board of Directors, or, as the case may be, by the Executive Committee. In allowing interest on deposits, the Board of Directors shall give due consideration to the value of the services performed for the depositor and the size of the depositors balance.VI.-Loans, Discounts and Investments. The Board of Directors shall determine the nature of the opera-tions to be undertaken by the Bank. Such operations shall be consistent with the policies of the central banks of the countries concerned. The Bank may in particular have the right (a) to deal directly with central banks, or (b) to deal through central banks which have agreed to act as its agent and correspondent, or (c) to deal with banks, bankers, corporations and individuals of any country in performing any authorised function provided the central bank of that country does not enter objection. When-ever any proposed credit operation affecting any particular market comes up for decision, the favourable vote of the Governor of the central bank concerned (or his nominee if the Governor is not present) sitting as a member of the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee, shall be taken as giving the assent of his
central bank. If he declines to give his assent, the proposed credit operation shall not be undertaken in his market.Thus the Bank may perform such functions as the following :  (1) To buy and to sell gold coin and bullion, to earmark gold for the account of central banks, and to make advances to central basks on gold as security.(2) To buy and to sell for its own account, either with or without its endorsement, bills of exchange and other short-term obligations of prime liquidity, including cheques drawn or endorsed by central banks or in respect of which three obligees are responsible.(3) To open arid maintain deposit accounts with central banks.(4) To rediscount for central banks bills taken from their portfolios, to make loans.to them on the security of such bills, or to make advances to them against the pledge of other securi-ties up to such amounts and for such periods as may be approved by the Board of Directors.(5) To buy and to sell for its own account intermediate or long-terms securities (other than shares) of a character approved by the Board of Directors. Its holdings of such securities at any one time shall not exceed the total of its paid-in capital and reserve funds.(6) To invest in Germany, with the assent of the Reichs-bank, reichsmark funds standing to the credit of the Bank at the reichsbank which are not transferable owing to a declara-tion of transfer postponement. The Bank may realise upon any such investments at its discretion unless at the time the investment was agreed to by the reichsbank some stipulation or arrangement affecting the possible sale was made a con-dition of such agreement. The income from any such invest-ments and the proceeds of such investments if sold, shall be deposited to the credit of the Bank at the reichsbank. Such funds may be held as deposits under the conditions set out in Annex IV of the Plan or be reinvested consistently with the provisions of that Annex.If in the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Bank, counter-obligations issued against its investments in Germany as collateral can be advantageously sold on non-German markets, their net proceeds shall be distributed to the creditor countries in such proportions and under the same conditions as would have applied in the case of normal transfer. The accounts of the creditor Powers shall be charged with the reichsmark cost of the securities alienated or pledged in the course of any such transaction. If the Board of Directors of the Bank decides that counter-obligations cannot be sold advantageously, the income and net proceeds of the investments when finally disposed of shall be distributed to the creditors.4?*y
The foregoing power is in addition to the general powers of the Bank to make and realise upon investments for its own account at any time, subject to the provision that such invest-ments are to be made with the assent of the central bank-concerned.(7) To issue its own obligations at long or short-term, secured or unsecured, for the purpose of re-lending to any central bank, in each case upon the specific decision of the Board of Directors by a two-thirds vote. The investment powers of the Bank shall never be used in such a way as to exercise a predominant influence over business interests in any country.   The Board of Directors &quot;shall guide the invest-ment undertakings of the Bank accordingly, and shall be entitled if necessary to make special regulations in this respect.VII. Trustee Functions : General Provisions.The Bank shall be trustee of the creditor Governments in dealing with the German annuities and shall have such general powers of administration consistent with the Plan as are necessary to the prompt and complete exercise of its duties in that respect.   The Organisation Committee shall draw up appropriate forms of trust agreement between the creditor Governments and the Bank. The trust functions of the Bank shall include the following :  (1) Receiving and disbursing to the paying agents the service on the German External Loan, 1924.   If arrangements can legally be made, the Bank shall also act in the capacity of one of the Trustees for that Loan.(2) Receiving from Germany the various certificates and obligations provided for in the Plan. The Bank shall hold these certificates and obligations in safe-keeping and shall issue to the creditors its trust receipts for such certificates and obli-gations. Upon the completion of the payments called for under these certificates and obligations for any one year, the respective creditor Governments shall give their quittance to the Bank, which in turn shall give its quittance to the German Govern-ment, cancelling and returning any coupons representing the payments made.(3) Receiving and distributing the service of the German annuities. The specifications of this function are given in Section VIII of this outline, below.(4) Performing as regards Deliveries in Kind such functions as may be entrusted to it by the Governments in connection with the acceptance of the new Plan.(5) Dealing with the measures of safeguard provided in the Plan. Upon receiving notification from the German Govern-ment consistently with the provisions of the Plan the Bank
shall convene the Special Advisory Committee whose compo-sition, procedure and action are provided for in Section 8 (e) of the Plan.(6) Acting as Trustee under trust agreements. The Bank shall have the power to act as trustee under trust agreements entered into by it with the approval or on the initiative of its Board of&quot;Directors, which has as its purpose the issue by the Bank of trust certificates or other obligations against invest-ments in securities pledged as collateral therefor. This power may be exercised in addition to the powers with respect to investments provided for in Section VI above.(7) Acting as trustee under special agreements. The Bank shall be authorised to act as trustee under any special agree*-ments among the creditor countries covering the repartition of the annuities or the guarantee of any parts of them. In parti-cuilar; the Bank shall have power to act as trustee under the agreement specified in Annex VIII of the Plan. The Bank shall be authorised to pay interest on any guarantee fund deposited with the Bank in connection with any such trust, and to arrange the terms on which the deposit is to be received and the fund managed, all in accordance with the Plan.(8) Acting as trustee at the request of a creditor Government ;, the German Government or the central bank of any one of those countries. The Bank shall have the right, upoo the&apos; approval of the Board of Directors, to undertake any trust, functions which any creditor Government or the German Government or any of their respective central banks proposes that it shall undertake, provided such functions are generally consistent with the purposes of the Plan.VIII. Trustee Functions : The Bank as Depositary for the Service of the German Annuities.The Bank, in its capacity as trustee for the creditor Governments shall receive and distribute the funds representing the service of the German annuities. In fulfilling these functions the Bank shall work in co-operation with the central banks of the countries con-cerned; the relations thus established shall be the ordinary rela-tionships obtaining between a bank and its correspondent banks.The procedure for conducting these operations, subject to the light of the Board of Directors of the Bank to make modifications provided the general purposes of the Plan are observed, shall be as follows :  (1) The Bank shall maintain on its books a general deposit account to be known as the Annuity Trust Account.(2) The German Government shall be responsible for the payment to the Bank, in instalments as provided in the Plan
of all sums applicable to the service of the annuity. These payments shall be credited to the Annuity Trust Account.The Organisation Committee shall make the necessary pro-vision whereby the reichsmark payments to the account of tin Bank at the Reichsbank in respect of the Railway contribution shall be immediately released to the German Government against equivalent payment in foreign currencies to the Annuity Trust Account.(3) Subject to the operation of the clauses of the Plan relating to transfer postponement, and except as the Bank may request that payments be made in reichsmarks to the credit of its account at the Reichsbank described in Paragraph 4 below, the German Government shall make all payments on account of the annuity in foreign currencies. Payments in foreign currencies not on a gold or a gold exchange standard shall be made only with the consent of the Bank. As a matter of business practice the Bank acting in advance of the payment dates may notify to the German Government or its agent the Bank&apos;s preferences with respect to the currencies in which payment may be made. In case the Bank&apos;s preferences are not complied with payment shall be made to the Bank in the currencies of the seven countries whose nationals are members of the present Experts&apos; Committee, divided as nearly as may-be in proportion to their respective shares in that portion of the annuity accruing to them.(4) All reichsmark payments for credit to the Annuity Trust Account shall be paid into an account of the Bank at the Reichsbank. The Bank shall be entitled to draw upon it in making all reichsmark payments necessary for the operation of the Plan, including payments for administrative expenses incurred in Germany, payments for deliveries in kind and any-other disbursements on annuity account. The Bank shall also be entitled to withdraw reichsmarks from this account or to deposit reichsmarks in it in the course of conducting opera-tions referred to. in Paragraph 14 below, and it may open other-accounts at the Reichsbank for use in connection therewith. Such additional accounts shall be operated according to ordinary business principles. The Bank shall have available at all times sufficient funds in reichsmarks to cover current requirements on account of payments for deliveries in kind.(5) The Bank shall give its receipt to the German Govern-ment for all sums which it pays or causes to be paid into the Annuity Trust Account in the course of carrying out its obliga-tions under the Plan. The receipt of the Bank shall make note of the currencies received, but credit shall be given in the reichsmark equivalent of those currencies. The German Government undertakes for the purpose of the present pro-visions, as well as for the general purposes of the Plan, that
the reichsmark shall have and shall retain its convertibility into gold or devisen as contemplated in Section 31 of the present Reichsbank Law, and that for these purposes the reichsmark shall have and shall retain a mint parity of 1/2790 kilogram jjf fine gold as defined in the German Coinage Law of August 30, 1924(*). Sums paid in foreign currencies into the Annuity Trust Account shall be calculated in terms of reichsmarks at the average of the middle rates (Mittelkurs) prevailing on the Berlin Bourse during the half-monthly period preceding the date of payment.(6) The Bank&apos;s receipt giving credit in reichsmarks for pay-ments made into the Annuity Trust Account by the German Government or on its behalf shall under normal operation of the Plan constitute a complete and sufficient discharge of the obligations of the German Government with respect to such payments. If, however, transfer postponement should be in whole or partial effect, the Bank&apos;s receipt giving credit in reichsmarks shall constitute a complete and sufficient discharge of the obligations of the German Government with respect to all payments into the Annuity Trust Account made in foreign exchange, and with respect to such portion of the payments made in reichsmarks as in the opinion of the Bank provide current funds for deliveries in kind or services. As to the remainder, the receipt of the Bank shall be in the nature of a temporary acknowledgment only.(7) Withdrawals from the Annuity Trust Account shall be made in accordance with provisions to be made by the Organisa-tion Committee. The Bank shall pay no interest on funds deposited in the Annuity Trust Account.(8) All disbursements for reparation purposes shall be charged against the Annuity Trust Account. A first charge against that account shall be the service currently due on the German External Loan, 1924. The Board of Directors shall be entitled also to charge against the account such sums as they deem to be fair compensation for the services performed by the Bank and such out-of-pocket expenses as it incurs in administering the Plan. If, in the opinion of the Directors, such service charges or costs cannot be equitably charged to the account as a whole, they shall be entitled to allocate them in such proportion as they see fit to the individual shares of any of the creditor countries.(9) After charging against the Annuity Trust Account the items referred to in the preceding paragraph and such other items as may be properly chargeable to the annuity as a whole,* See the letter from the President of the Reichsbank given in Annex II.
the Bank shall proceed in the following manner with the distri-bution of the remainder of the available funds to the accounts of the several creditors in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.(10) During such period of time as payments for deliveries in kind and payments under Reparation Recovery Act and similar procedures continue to be made, the Bank shall make available to the several creditor countries reichsmark credits, which shall be utilised subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan.(11) The Bank, out of each instalment paid into the Annuity Trust Account, shall set aside and accumulate funds for the payment of service on any bonds issued and outstanding which represent commercialised and mobilised shares in the annuity. Funds required for this purpose shall be charged against the accounts of the creditor countries in proportion to their respective interests in the bonds for which service is being accumulated. At a suitable time in advance of the dates fixed for the payment of interest to the bondholders, the Bank shall pa3&apos; to the paying agents the amounts clue in interest, and shall make disposition according to the terms of the bond of funds required for purposes of amortisation.(12) Out of the sums remaining in currencies other than reichsmarks, and after providing for any other charges called for under the Plan, the Directors of the Bank shall distribute such aggregate amounts as they may determine to the creditor countries, divided according to the proportions agreed upon among the respective Governments. In withholding any sums from distribution and in fixing the dates at which distribution is effected, the Directors of the Bank shall be guided on the one hand by the need for prompt action in the interests of the creditor countries and on the other by the interests of the Plan as a whole, including due consideration to the Bank by way of compensation for its services in managing the annuity.(13) The Bank shall make distribution of cash by credit-ing the accounts which the central banks of the several creditor countries maintain with it, notifying them simul-taneously that such credits are for the accounts of their respective Governments. The Bank shall notify the proper financial authorities of the creditor countries when such credits have been made, and shall obtain receipts from them accordingly.(14) The Bank shall have the right to buy for its own account or for other trust accounts any reichsmarks held in the Annuity Trust Account, giving foreign currencies in return. The foreign currencies thus acquired by the Annuity-Trust  Account  shall  be  available  for  distribution   to  the
creditor countries under the conditions specified in the preceding paragraphs. The reichsmarks which the Bank acquires shall be used only as the Plan provides.(15) The Bank, at the close of each business year, or more frequently if requested, shall give to the financial authorities of each creditor country a full accounting showing the dis-position of its share in the annuity. As soon as any country has received its full share in the annuity for any one year, its proper financial authority shall give to the Bank his ack-nowledgment and shall enter the same upon the trust receipt provided for in Paragraph 2 of Section VII of this outline. Such acknowledgment shall constitute a full and sufficient discharge to the Bank with respect to the annuity covered by it.IX. Agency Functions.The Bank shall be qualified, on terms to be mutually agreed upon, to act as agent and correspondent of any central bank, and to appoint any central bank to act as its agent and corre-correspondent. The services to be performed by either or both parties under such agreements shall be subject, so far as the Bank&apos;s interest is concerned, to the approval of its Board of Directors and may include the purchase and sale of gold, of bills of exchange and other securities, the ear-marking of gold, the exchange of information and advice, and the transaction of any business con-sistent with the functions of the Bank under the Plan on the one hand and within the lawful functions of the central bank on the other.The Bank shall act as agent of any creditor Government in mobilising any parts of the annuities, and in managing the ser-vice of bonds issued in connection with any such mobilisation. The procedure for conducting the Bank&apos;s share in such opera-tions, subject to the right of the Organisation Committee or the Board of Directors of the Bank to make modifications provided the general purposes of the Plan are observed shall be as follows :  (1) Upon the request of the creditor Governments, or any of them, the Bank shall initiate operations for marketing bonds, if after examination it considers market conditions warrant such operations. Such operations may take place in the international markets, or may be restricted, to the domestic market or markets of the countries concerned in the proposed mobilisation, as the Board of Directors may decide. In determining the markets where offerings are to be made, the Bank shall make enquiries from the central banks con-cerned, and if any central bank offers explicit objection to an offering being made in its own market, the Directors shall decide accordingly.
(2) The Bank shall proceed to carry out requests from any creditor Government for the creation of bonds to be issued on its domestic market in connection with conversion opera-tions up to an amount represented in its share in the annuities. Each State shall be free to offer such bonds on its own market on whatever conditions it can obtain.(3) If in the opinion of the Bank the time is opportune for an issue of bonds, even if no request for mobilisation has been received, the Bank may inform the creditor Govern-ments accordingly.(4) If the creditor Governments so request, the Bank shall arrange with issuing bankers the conditions upon which bonds are to be issued on the open markets either of one or of several countries, as the case may be. The Bank shall fix the minimum price at which such issues shall be made, and it shall supervise the execution of the loan contracts.(5) If bonds are issued against the annuity shares of more than one country, the proceeds shall be deposited with the Bank, which shall then distribute the proceeds to the cre-ditors according to their participation. The handling of the service of issued bonds shall be carried out as provided in the preceding Section of this outline, and in Annex III.(6) Apart from the operations described above, the Bank may conduct any other operations (such, for instance, as contango operations on bonds issued against the annuities, advances on coupons, etc.) as are involved in the supervision of transactions relating to these bonds and their service.X. Reserve Requirements.The Bank, since its deposits in part will be derived from central banks, shall be administered with particular regard to maintaining its liquidity. For this purpose, the Bank shall observe the fol-lowing reserve requirements : (1) Deposits on clearing account. All funds held by the Bank on clearing account, whether gold in vault or gold under earmark for the Bank&apos;s account in central banks, shall be reserved for exclusive use in effecting settlements among the depositaries in the account.(2) Deposits payable on demand. Against such deposits the Bank shall hold a minimum of 40 per cent, in gold or in devisen at their gold value. Devisen eligible as reserve against demand deposits shall consist of banknotes; prime bills of exchange having not more than 90 days to run, of a character which central banks ordinarily buy for their own account; and cheques payable on demand drawn or endorsed by central banks, or in respect of which three obligees including a bank of known solvency are responsible. All devisen included in the foregoing classifications shall be
denominated in currencies which satisfy in the opinion of the Board of Directors all the practical requirements of the gold or gold exchange standard. Gold in transit, or devisen satisfying the foregoing requirements which are in process of collection, may be counted as reserve.(3) Deposits on  investment  account.      (Time  deposits.) Deposits, payable in fifteen days or less shall be classified as demand deposits and be subject to the reserve require-ments specified in the preceding paragraph.     Against invest-ment account deposits of longer maturity the Bank shall hold a minimum of 25 per cent, in gold or in devisen at their gold value.     Devisen   eligible   as   reserve   against   investment account deposits shall meet the same requirements as those eligible as reserve against demand deposits. If the Board of Directors is of opinion that these reserve require-ments should be altered, they shall have the right by a two-thirds vote to increase, diminish or otherwise modify them consistently with sound banking principles.XI. Distribution of Profits.The yearly net profits of the Bank shall be applied as follows : (1) Five per cent, of the yearly net profits shall be paid to the Legal Beserve Fund of the Bank until that fund reaches an amount equal to 10 per cent, of the paid-in capital stock of the Bank as it may stand from time to time. The Legal Beserve Fund on the liquidation of the Bank shall be merged with the General Reserve Fund.(2) After making the foregoing provision for the Legal Beserve Fund, the yearly net profits shall be applied to the payment of an annual dividend up to 6 per cent, on the paid-in share capital.     This dividend shall be cumulative.(3) Twenty per cent, of the remainder shall be paid to the shareholders until a total maximum dividend of 12 per cent, is reached. The Board of Directors of the Bank snail have the right in any year to withhold all or any part of this addi-tion to the regular dividend, and to place it to the credit of a special dividend reserve fund for use in maintaining the cumu-lative dividend provided for in the preceding paragraph or for-subsequent distribution to the shareholders.(4) After making provision for the foregoing, one-half of the yearly net profits then remaining shall be paid into the General Beserve Fund of the Bank until it equals the paid-in capital. Thereafter 40 per cent, shall be so applied until the General Beserve Fund equals twice the paid-in capital; 30 per cent, until it equals three times the paid-in capital; 20 per cent, until it equals four times the paid-in capital; 10 per cent, until it equals five times the paid-in capital; and from that point onward, 5 per cent.
The General Reserve Fund shall be available for meeting any losses incurred by the Bank. In case it is not adequate for this purpose, recourse may be had to the Legal Reserve Fund provided for under Paragraph 1. In case the General Reserve Fund, by reason of losses or by reason of an increase in the paid-in capital, falls below the amounts provided for above after having once attained them, the appropriate pro-portion of the yearly net profits shall again be applied until the position is restored. Upon the liquidation of the Bank, the balance in the General Reserve Fund shall be divided among the shareholders.(5) The remainder of the yearly net profits after meeting the foregoing requirements shall be paid in to Special Funds as follows :(a) Seventy-five per cent, to the Governments or central banks of the creditor countries or of Germany which maintain time deposits at the Bank withdrawable in not less than five years from the time of deposit, and after four years or not less than one year&apos;s notice. Tho fund shall be disbursed annually in amounts proportionate to the size of the deposits maintained by the respective Governments or central banks aforesaid. The Directors of the Bank shall have power to determine the volume of each of these deposits which would justify the distribution provided for.(b) Twenty-five per cent, to be used to aid Germany in paying the last 22 annuities, provided the German Government elects to make a long-term deposit with the Bank, withdrawable only on the terms specified under Sub-paragraph (a) above and amounting to the minimum sum of 400,000,000 reichsmarks. If the German Government elects to make such long-term deposits amounting to a sum below 400 million reichsmarks the participation of the German Government shall be reduced in proportion, and the balance shall be added to the 75 per cent, in Sub-paragraph (a). The fund shall carry compound interest at the maximum current rate paid by the Bank on time deposits. If the fund should exceed the amount required to pay the 22 last annuities, the balance shall be distributed among the creditor Govern-ments in proportion to their out-payments during that period. In case the German Government elects not to make any such long-term deposits the fund shall be dis-tributed as provided in Sub-paragraph (a) above.XII. General Provisions.Any balances remaining in the hands of the Agent General for Reparation Payments on the winding up of his accounts shall be
transferred to the Bank for credit to the Annuity Trust Account, subject, of course, to the respective interests of the creditor countries therein and to any claims and commitments which may be outstanding at the time.The relations of the Reparation Commission with Germany will be terminated. The Bank shall take over as promptly as possible such functions of the Reparation Commission with respect to Germany as are required under the provisions of the Plan, and also such functions of the Agent General for Reparation Payments, the Trustees and Commissioners holding office under the Experts&apos; Plan of 1924, or any of them, as may be required under the pro-visions of the Plan, all according to the general scheme given in Part 6 of the Plan and Annex V.If in any country there is more than one bank of issue, the term &quot; central bank &quot; as used in this outline shall be interpreted to mean the bank of issue situated and operating in the principal financial market of that country.If in the process of organising the Bank or in the performance of its functions after establishment, it is found that the central bank of any country or its Governor is unable to act officially or unofficially in any or all of the capacities provided for in this out-line, or refrains from so acting, alternative arrangements not incon-sistent with the laws of that country shall be made. In parti-cular, the Governors of the central banks of the countries whose nationals are members of the present committee, or as many of them as are qualified to act, may invite to become members of the Board of Directors of the Bank two nationals of any country the central bank of which is eligible under this outline to take part in forming the Board of the Bank but does not do so. The two nationals of that country upon acceptance of the invitation shall be qualified to act in the full capacity of Directors of the Bank as provided in this outline. Further, the Directors of the Bank shall be authorised to appoint in lieu of any central bank not exercising any or all of the functions, authorities or privileges which this outline provides that central banks make or shall exercise, any bank or banking house of widely recognised standing and of the same nationality. Such bank or banking house, upon appoint-ment and acceptance, shall be entitled to act in the place of the central bank in any or all capacities appropriate to central banks under this outline, provided, only that such action is not incon-sistent with the laws of the country in question.The balance sheet and accounts of the Bank shall be audited each year by independent auditors of recognised standing, who shall be appointed by and report to the Board of Directors.In case the measures proposed in the Plan with respect to the avoidance of double and triple taxation of the Bank are not fully in effect when the Bank begins operations, the Board of Directors shall deal with the matter within its discretion.
If any administrative act of the Bank or any decision of the Board of Directors is disputed on the ground that it is inconsistent with the provisions or intent of the Plan, recourse may be had to arbitration under the general provisions for arbitration.Paris, June 6, 1929.Dear Mr. Chairman,I understand that certain of the creditor groups have raised the question as to the interpretation to be given to the word &quot; Beichs-marks &quot;, in which the obligations of Germany under the new Plan are expressed. In my opinion the question is a purely formal one, as the Beichsmark is de facto on a gold basis, and has proved itself since its creation as stable a currency as any other in the world.Nevertheless, in order that there should be no possibility of question as to the exact definition of Germany&apos;s liability, I am of opinion that the provisions of Section 31 of the Bank Law of 30th August, 1924, should be put into effect, and I am therefore prepared to introduce the necessary resolutions with the Managing Board and the General Council of the reichsbank at the latest in connection with the putting into force of the present Plan by the Governments.Believe me, dear Mr. Chairman, Yours, sincerely, (Signed)      Hjalmar Schacht.Owen D. Young, Esq.,Chairman of the Committee of Experts, Paris,Hotel George V.MOBILISATION. I. Form of Indebtedness. Germany&apos;s debt shall be fixed in the form of annuities.     A certificate of indebtedness representative of these annuities shall be delivered by Germany to the Bank as trustee of the creditor Powers.To this certificate of indebtedness shall be attached coupons representative of each annuity payable by Germany. Each annuity coupon shall be divided into two parts; the first, representative of that portion of the annuity not subject to postponement and corresponding to the portion of Germany&apos;s indebtedness which is mobilisable; the second, representative of that portion of the annuity which is subject to postponement and corresponding to the portion of Germany&apos;s indebtedness which is not mobilisable. Each part of the annuity coupon enjoys equal rights throughout except with respect to the agreed privilege of postponement.
51181II. Bond Issues.Upon the request of all or of any one of the creditor Govern-ments the Bank, as trustee, if it considers such a course opportune, has the right to recfuire the creation of, and the German Govern-roent is obligated to create, issuable bonds representing the capitalisation of any part of the portion of the annuity coupons not subject to postponement.The Bank, however, is obliged, under the provisions set forth in paragraph VII (d), to accede to requests for the creation of bonds made to it by Governments which are desirous of under-taking internal issues of German bonds in connection with conversion operations.The certicates of indebtedness, the coupons attached thereto, and such bonds as shall be issued in capitalisation of any parts of the annuities not subject to postponement, shall be made out in the name of the German Beich and shall represent the obligation of the Beich guaranteed by its general revenues.III. collateral guarantees.A. The Railway Company shall deposit with the Bank for Inter-national Settlements a certificate acknowledging its liability in respect of the obligations laid down in Part 8 (a) of this Plan.B. The Reich, furthermore, shall undertake to assign certain revenues (customs, and certain taxes on consumption) for the service of the certificates and, as far as they may be exchanged into negotiable bonds, fo? the service of such bonds. This assign-ment will constitute a negative pledge and will be ruled by the following conditions : (a) The assigned revenues as estimated for the Budget, 1929, must have a total yield of not less than 150 per cent, of the highest Budgetary contribution payable by Germany under this Plan.(b) The Reich will not pledge the assigned revenues for any other loan or credit, except with the consent of the Bank. If the assigned revenues should be pledged, with the consent of the Bank, for any other loan or credit, the charge for reparation payment will rank ahead of the charge for such other loan or credit.(c) If, at any time, the total yield of the assigned revenues should fall below 150 per cent, of the highest Budgetary con-tribution payable by Germany under this Plan the Bank may require that additional revenues, sufficient to assure the immediate restoration of the yield to the above percentage, be assigned.
IV. General Form op the Bonds.The value of the issuable bonds may, according to circumstances, be expressed in dollars, equivalent to so many pounds, reichsmarks, francs, etc., or inversely in pounds, in reichsmarks, in francs, etc., always provided that the principal of any bond issued in a particular market shall be payable only in the currency of that market at the equivalent of its gold value.The coupons shall be expressed in dollars, pounds, francs, etc., and shall be payable at the rate of the day on all the markets on which the bonds are quoted.In the event of an issue, the amount and form of bonds to be created, as well as the specification of the currency in which they shall be issued, shall be fixed by the Bank in accordance with the requests which it receives from the creditor Governments, taking into account the desiderata of the issuing bankers.After a period of 10 years the Bank, in agreement with the issuing bankers and the creditor Governments, may consider the issue of bonds, the service of which may be paid in different currencies at par at the bearer&apos;s option.V. -Status of Mobilisable,Portions of Annuity Coupons.The service of interest and amortisation of the mobilisable or mobilised portions of the annuity coupons shall be paid to the Bank in foreign currencies by the German Reich without any reservation, i.e.,,on its own responsibility; the financial service of these mobilisable or mobilised portions of the annuities shall constitute a final, absolute and unconditional international obligation in the ordinary financial sense of the word.VI. Status of &quot;Non-Mobilisable Portions of the Annuity Coupons.The payment of the non-mobilisable portion of the annuity coupons shall be made to the Bank by the German Government in the same conditions as that of the mobilised or mobilisable portion of the annuity coupons.Nevertheless :- -1. Bonds representing the non-mobilisable portion of the annuity coupons cannot be created except with the consent of the German Government.2. It is in respect of the non-mobilisable portion of the annuity coupons that the German Government may avail itself of the right of postponing transfer or payment granted elsewhere in this Plan.
VII. Functions of the Bank.(a) Supervision of Agreements.It shall supervise, both on behalf of the creditor Governments and the bondholders and on behalf of the debtor Government, the strict execution of the agreements concluded between them on the established bases.(b) Distribution without Priority.The Bank shall distribute moneys in payment of the mobilised or mobilisable portions of the annuity coupon among the whole of the bondholders and the creditor Governments in proportion to the rights of each to share in the portion of the annuity coupons not subject to postponement, without allowing a priority of any kind to any tranche or to any claim. It will distribute the moneys relating to the non-mobilisable portions of the annuity coupons amongst the creditor Governments, the transfer of these moneys taking place only after the transfer of the moneys relating to the mobilised or mobilisable portion of the annuity coupon...... -    1 &apos;    . , ;(c) Issue of Bonds on the Markets.The Bank shall inform the creditor Governments whenever the issue of bonds representing the capitalisation of some part of the mobilisable portion of the annuity coupon is practicable in its opinion.It will be the function of the Bank to fix the minimum price of issue.Each of the creditor Governments shall be entitled, but not obliged, to issue its share of the bonds in its own country. It may come to an understanding with the bankers of another country to cede to them all or part of this share, but these bankers shall be obliged to proceed to this issue only on the minimum conditions fixed by the Bank. Any of these Governments may also refuse to allow its quota to be created; in that event the portion of the annuity corresponding to this quota shall continue to be paid to the Governments in question as before.(d) Issue of Conversion Bonds-.Creditor Governments desiring to proceed to internal issues of German bonds, in connection with operations for the conversion of national debt shall have the option of asking the Bank to create bonds representing all or part- of their quota of the mobilisable portion of the annuity coupons. These bonds shall constitute national tranches which each Government shall be free to offer on its own market on whatever conditions it can obtain. These bonds shall be quoted only on their market of issue. The service of these bonds shall, however, be effected pari passu with that of the other bonds.   The coupons of these bonds shall be expressed
in pounds, dollars, French francs, etc., and shall be payable at the rate of the day on all the markets on which the mobilisable bonds are quoted.CONDITIONS OF POSTPONEMENT OF TRANSFER ANDOF PAYMENT.1.-Postponement of Transfer.The German Government by giving at least 90 days&apos; previous notice shall have the right to suspend for a maximum period of two years from its due date all or part of the transfer of that part of the annuity described as postponable. Transfer postponement thus declared shall affect the postponabie annuity as and from that date only on which transfer postponement becomes effective.If, during any annuity year, the German Government shall avail itself of this power, the transfers falling due during any second year cannot be postponed for more than one year from their respective due dates, unless and until the transfers due during the first year shall have been effected in full, in which case the transfers due during such second year may be postponed two years from their respective due dates; and the transfers due during any third year cannot be postponed at all until the transfers due during the first year have been effected in full.2. Liability.::::SS:S5: &apos;The liability of the German Government with regard to the annuities contemplated in this Plan is not fulfilled until all sums, the transfer of payment of which may be from time to time post-poned, have actually been transferred in full to the Bank for Inter-national Settlements in approved foreign currencies, or utilised for deliveries in kind.3. Postponement of Payment.At any time when postponement of transfer is in effect, but, not until one year after it has become effective, the German Govern-ment shall have the right to postpone payment for one year of fifty per cent, of any sum the transfer of which shall then be susceptible of postponement under paragraph 1 of this Annex. This percentage may be increased upon the recommendation of the Advisory Committee provided for in Part 8 (e) of this Report.4. Utilisation of Reichmarks.Any sum in Reichmarks, the transfer of which is postponed, shall (save as provided for in Section 3 above) be deposited to the account of the Bank of International Settlements at the Beiclis-bank for eventual release of balances, not absorbed by deliveries in
kind, against payment in foreign currencies by the German Govern-Government. At all times, the employment, whether for investment or as indicated below, of Reichsmarks so deposited shall be subject to agreement between the Reichsbank and the Bank for International Settlements. In determining the manner in which these sums shall be employed, regard shall be had to the possibilities that special programmes of deliveries in kind can be arranged with the German Government.(a) during the first ten years, by restricting or extending the programme of deliveries in kind laid down for those years;(b) after the first ten years, by arranging a special programme of deliveries in kind, where the interests of particular industries in Germany and of particular creditor countries which would otherwise suffer, may be met without prejudice to the general situation;provided however that any special arrangement which may be made between any creditor country and Germany with a view to reserving to the said creditor the right to receive certain deliveries in kind in case of moratorium shall be carried through subject to a copy of the agreement therefor being communicated to the Bank for International Settlements.5. Interest.Interest at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum above the prevail-ing Reichsbank discount rate, or at five and a half per cent., which-ever is lower, shall be paid half-yearly by the German Govern-ment on the daily amount of the sums the transfer or payment of which has been postponed and which have not been invested or utilised for deliveries in kind. This interest shall be treated in all respects similarly to the principal sum upon which it accrues, and. the return upon that portion of the funds actually invested shall be for the account of the creditor Powers.ANNEX ON ORGANISATION COMMITTEES.1. Just as the Dawes Plan was put into force by the agreement of the Governments concerned laid down in the London Protocol, the New Plan will have to be put into force by agreement of the Governments.Once the Governments have accepted in principle the New Plan it seems advisable that, in addition to any preparatory measures necessary for the Conference of the Governments, steps should be taken for the elaboration of detailed schemes about certain technical questions.Generally speaking it seems advisable to have these schemes elaborated by special organisation committees, which should be
composed substantially in the same way as the organisation eora-mittees of the Dawes Plan, i.e. by the same number of repre-sentatives of the creditors as of the debtor with a neutral chairman to be called in case of disagreement. The Organisation Committee for the New Bank would, however, be differently composed.We recommend such organisation committees for the following questions : (D Organisation Committee for the New Bank, as provided for in Annex I of the Beport.(2) Organisation Committee for the adaptation of the Ger-man Laws set up under the Dawes Plan, composed of members of the sub-committees next mentioned, with one neutral Chair-man. This Committee should have 3 Sub-committees, to be composed each of 2 creditor members nominated by the Separation Commission and 2 German members nominated by the German Government.(ft) for the adaptation in agreement with the Trustees, of the system under which the securities assigned to the Dawes Loan are managed and of the machinery of the assigned revenues, referred to in Annex 3.(b) adaptation of the Bank Law (independence of the reichsbank).(v) adaptation of the Germany Railway Law (inde-pendence of the German Railway Company).2. After the Governments have concluded a comprehensive arrangement for putting into force the New Plan it will necessary to provide some special organisation which will undertake the administrative work of setting up the organisations provided for by the New Plan and of handing over to them the functions of the existing organisations.As there is only one new organisation which is going to centralise all the various functions concerning the execution of the New Plan viz. the Bank for International Settlements, it is necessary to provide one special body only for the setting up of this organisa-tion, this body to be the organisation committee for the new Bank referred to above, as provided for in Annex I.The task of transferring the functions of the existing organisations to the Bank for International Settlements should be conferred upon a small special committee composed of 2 members of the organisa-tion committee for the Bank for International Settlements as well as of representatives of the German Government, the Agent General and the Reparation Commission, an equitable representation being assured to the Powers represented upon the present Committee.
THE BELGIAN MARK CLAIM.The Experts recognise that though the settlement of the so-called Belgian Mark Claim is not within the term of reference of this Committee, their Belgian colleagues cannot reasonably be expected in view of the discussions which preceded the call of the Committee, to join in the Report except on the understanding that an agreement for the settlement of the Mark Claim will be reached by direct negotiations between the Belgian and German Govem-ments. The Experts understand that negotiations for the purpose are about to open as between the two Governments and they recognise that the new Plan cannot become operative until the Belgian and German Governments have come to an internation-ally binding agreement on the Mark Claim; and in view of the German Governments undertakings as stated in the correspondence annexed (letters from Dr. Schacht of the 3rd June (see Annex VI A) and from Dr. Kastl of the 4th June (see Annex VI B), they recommend to their respective Governments accordingly.If the settlement of the Marks Claim takes the form of an annuity and if the Belgian and German Governments so request, the Experts are ready to recommend to their Governments to offer no objection to the annuity taking the identical form of the annuities covered in this Report and to its being administered in the same way by the Bank for International Settlements.3rd June, 1929.Dear Mr. Chairman,Supplementing my talk with you of last Saturday on the Belgian Mark matter, I have the honour to inform you that the German Government is prepared to proceed along the following lines :1. Immediately to enter into a &quot; pactum de contrahendo &quot; with the Belgian Government (either by exchange of notes or by signed protocol) whereby the two Governments will agree to enter into negotiations on a new basis looking to a definite settlement of the Mark controversy.2. To commence such negotiations promptly and to agree that these negotiations should be concluded before the New Reparation Plan has been put into force by the Governments.3. The German Government has appointed Herr Ministerial-direktor Bitter as its special representative to handle the above matters and he is prepared to open discussions promptly.The substance of the foregoing has been communicated to the Belgian Minister in Berlin, whose reply the German Government now awaits.
The foregoing proposal has been made by the German Govem-ment in a conciliatory spirit and in an effort in good faith to remove this impediment to the normal development of friendly relations between the two countries concerned.I hope that the foregoing statements may remove any misunder-standings which exist as to the position of the German Government with respect to the Belgian Mark matter, and in view of such mis-understandings heretofore. I would appreciate your advising the other members of the Committee of the position of the German Government as stated herein.With assurances of my personal esteem,I am,Sincerely yours,(Signed)   Dr. Hjalmar Schacht.Mr. Owen D. Young, Hotel George A7., Paris.Baris, 4th June, 1929.Dear Mr. Lamont,Confirming my conversation of this morning with you and Mr. Perkins, I desire to make clear the following : (1) The position of the German Government, as stated in Dr. Schacht&apos;s letter to the Chairman of 3rd June, 1929, is in no way changed.(2) Dr. Bitter, of the German Foreign Office, Representative for the settlement of the Mark question, has again declared to us on behalf of the German Government, that : (a) He is prepared to start negotiations immediately. He suggests that such negotiations should take place in Brussels or Berlin.(b) No territorial questions will be raised in these negotiations.Sincerely yours,(Signed)      Kastl.Mr. Thomas W. Lamont, Hotel Bitz, Paris.
Paris, 4th June, 1929.Mr dear President,You have been so good as to communicate to me the letters which were sent to you by Dr. Schacht and Dr. Kastl in the name of their Government on 3rd a*id 4th June, respectively.In the first of these letters, Dr. Schacht stated that his Govern-ment is ready to accept an engagement to negotiate with the Belgian Government, upon a new basis, in order to arrive at a definitive settlement of the Mark question.He adds that the German Government is willing to begin these negotiations rapidly and to agree that they should be terminated before the new Reparation Plan has been put into force by the Governments.In the second, Dr. Kastl declares that no territorial question will be raised in these negotiations.You are aware of the reasons because of which the Belgian Dele-gation up to the present has refused to sign the Report before a settlement of the Mark question had been realised, not desiring to find itself later in a. position which it knew to be without issue, and on the other hand standing out for reparation of the serious damage which Belgium has suffered.Considering the engagement of the German Government and considering also the recommendation which the Experts unani-mously decided to-day to address to their respective Governments and which will be incorporated in the Report, the Belgian Experts agree to sigh the Report before the Mark negotiations have been terminated.I reserve the right to communicate to the German Government the different memoranda which have been exchanged during the course of the work of the Experts.Believe me, etc., etc.,(Signed)      E. Erancqui.

2. We recommend that out of the unconditional Annuity of 660 million R.M. the amount of 500 million R.M. should be allocated to France subject to the provision of a Guarantee Fund by the French Government in accordance with the arrangements set out in Annex VIII. Out of the remainder of the unconditional Annuity, after allowing for the service of the Dawes Loan, 42 mil-lion R.M. will be apportioned to Italy. So far as concerns the balance of the unconditional Annuity, and the amounts by which it is increased as the requirements for the service of the Dawes Loan become less and cease, Italy will have no claim until so much of the balance as may be required for an equitable apportionment shall have been allotted, by agreement of all the Governments, to the remaining Powers entitled to share in the annuities provided for by this Plan.3. The schedule of Deliveries in Kind set out in Part 8 (/) shall be allocated among the Creditor Governments as follows : GreatYears. Total. France. Britain. Italy.					Belgium.	Japan.	Serbia.

The sums received under the Dawes Plan in respect of the period 1st April to 31st August, 1929, shall, after allowing for expenses in respect of administration of the Dawes Plan and Armies of Occupation, be redistributed to the extent necessary to provide each of the Creditor Powers with cover for its net debt outgoings during the year ending 31st March, 1930. (These out-goings are as stated in Part 8 of the Report.) The necessary adjustments for this purpose could be made against the payments during the last seven months of that year.5. It is suggested that the division between the Creditor Govern-ments proposed in the present Annex should be accepted as a definitive settlement of all questions relating to the distribution of German payments and should not be affected by any existing arrangements or by the result of accounts relating to past trans-action.
On the other hand, it is not suggested that the present plan should affect or disturb in any way any existing inter-Allied agreements relating to payments, cessions or deliveries on the part of the Powers formerly allied with Germany. It may, however, prove necessary to examine any provisions of these agreements under which receipts by the Creditor Powers could be accounted for as between themselves in terms of German C Bonds in order that they may be gjyen an application consistent with their original practical purpose.6. The approval of the Report by the Experts of the principal Creditor countries is made formally contingent on this distribution.Guarantee Fund in Respect of Unconditional Annuities.I. The experts of the principal Creditor Governments have agreed that there shall be assigned to France out of the unconditional annuity 500 million R.M., in order to allow her to mobilise a sub-stantial part of her share in the total annuity.The aforesaid experts consider that this assignment should be final, and in no case subject to diminution, but should continue to be included in the total assigned to France subject only to the alteration contemplated in the Special Memorandum signed con-currently with the Report of this Committee.2. In order to equalise the short payments to other Creditors which would arise from a postponement of the postponable portion of the Annuity, it was agreed that France should deposit a special guarantee fund with the Bank for International Settlements.3. On the coming into force of this Plan, France will give to the Bank for International Settlements an undertaking to deposit in a Trust Fund, on the demand of the Bank for International Settlements foreign currencies to a total value of 500 million R.M. It is understood that this demand will not be made until action has been taken leading to the calling of the Advisory Committee re-ferred to in Section 8 (e) of the Report. The amount of 500 million iv.M. will be reduced by the amount of any payments made by France under g 4 below. The Bank for International Settlements may retain this deposit as long as it deems necessary, but shall pay interest on it at its maximum current rate for long-term deposits. This deposit, if it is agreed that it shall remain for more than five years, shall be entitled to participate in the profits of the Bank divisible under Part XI.5 of Annex I.4. As soon as mobilisation of any part of the French annuity has been effected, France will deduct from the proceeds 10 per cent, thereof, or 500 million R.M., whichever is the less, and will deposit it to the credit of the Trust Account of the Bank for Inter-national Settlements referred to in the preceding paragraph. 4749 0
5. Upon postponement of transfer of any payment due from Ger-many, the Bank for International Settlements shall take the following steps:  (a) Offer to the creditors, other than France, devisen up to the amount necessary (but not exceeding 500 million R.M. divided if necessary proportionately) to ensure to each of them receipts :in devisen equal to the amounts they would have received had the non-postponable annuity been distributed in the same proportions as the total annuity.(b) Debit the Trust Fund set up under g 2 above with the amount of devisen actually utilised under paragraph (a).(c) Receive from each Creditor, in exchange for devisen accepted under paragraph (a), an assignment in favour of the Trust Fund of an equivalent amount of the annuity, transfer of which has been postponed.6. As and when Germany effectively transfers the postponed amounts, the Bank will credit to the Trust Fund its share thereof in accordance with the assignment in g 5 (c) above.CONCURRENT MEMORANDUM BUT NOT A PART OFTHE REPORT.Committee of Experts.Special Memorandum of the Experts of the Principal Creditor Powers and of Germany regarding Out-Payments.(Signed concurrently with the Report of the Committee of Experts.) 1.

It is represented that in the event of modifications of those obligations for out-payments, by which the Creditors benefit, there should be some corresponding mitigation of the German annuities. The Experts of the four chief Creditor countries and of Germany therefore recommend that Germany and all the Creditor Govern-ments having obligations for out-payments should undertake between themselves an arrangement on the following basis : 2. Any relief which any Creditor Power may effectively receive, in respect of its net outward payments on account of War Debts: after making due allowance for any material or financial counter-considerations, and after taking into account any remissions on account of war debt receipts which it may itself make, shall be dealt with as follows :  As regards the first 37 years.(a) Germany shall benefit to the extent of two-thirds of the net relief available by way of a reduction in her annuity obligations thereafter.(b) One-third of the net relief shall be retained by the creditor concerned; in addition to the amounts otherwise receivable from Germany.(c) Nevertheless, so long as any liability of Germany persists in respect of the period after the 31st March, 1966, the creditor concerned will retain annually only one-fourth part of the net relief, the balance being paid to the Bank for International Settlements.(d) These payments to the Bank for International Settle-ments. shall accumulate to assist Germany towards meet-ing her liabilities in respect of the period after the 31st March. 1966; any sums found after application of the funds provided in-Annex 1 not to be required for this purpose (together with the accumulations thereon) shall be returned to the creditor by whom they were provided.As regards the last 22 years.The whole of such relief shall be applied to the reduction of Germany&apos;s liabilities.3. We recommend that the Creditor Governments should agree that, if the operation of the relief to Germany envisaged in respect of a possible reduction of net out-payments is such as to change materially the proportions in which the total annuities provided for in the present plan are divided amongst them, they meet to consider a revision tending towards the restoration of the present
proportions; but having regard to the following conditions set out below and any other relevant factors then existing (a) The service of any bonds mobilised by the creditor country? and the balance of its net outward payments in respect of war debts remaining to be covered must continue to be met out of the share falling to it in the annuities thereafter to be paid by Germany.(b) Due allowance shall be made for any material or finan-cial counter-considerations accepted by the creditor country in connection with the relief accorded to it in respect of war debts payments.4. It was originally suggested that the amounts of the post-ponable annuities should be regulated by reference to the net amounts which the various creditors were themselves able to postpone in respect of inter-Allied War Debts, the general con-clitions therein governing postponements to be applied. For various reasons, this method of calculation could not be adopted, but endeavour was made to adapt the moratorium provisions in such a way that the rights granted to Germany should not be greater than those of the Creditor Powers. The unconditional part of the annuity has therefore been fixed, while guarantees have been provided for the remainder.Francqui. Gutt.E. Moreau. J. Parmentier. Hjalmar Schacht. Kastl.J. C. Stamp. C.
