THIS do a^vJP-TT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOTEPdffMENT. ^SECRET.CP. 153(29) .CABINET. HOUSING     SUBSIDY.COPY NO.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.&apos;ju mm mm, mm m mmI am generally in agreement with the proposal of the Minister of Health (Memorandum CP.157(29)) to introduce at an early date a Bill providing that the Order of December last, so far as it deals with subsidies under the Housing (financial Provisions) Act, 1924, shall not take effect.     The result of such legislation would be that the present annual subsidy of  9 per house ( 12.10.-. in rural parishes) for 40 years would remain unaltered in Scotland as regards houses completed after 30th September next.     This would encourage local authorities to proceed with further schemes, a matter of importance in view of the fact that there is already evidence of a slowing down in the rate of house building in Scotland.I have no objection to the 1923 Act subsidy being cut down from o 6 to  4 as determined by the Order.I am convinced, however, that the housing needs of Scotland cannot adequately be met by the mere restoration of the 1924 Act subsidy to its present amount as is proposed above and that more active measures should be taken immediately to tackle the problem of slum areas which is one of pressing importance in Scotland.     Although Scottish Local Authorities have already made a certain measure of progress with slum clearance schemes they have done little more than touch the fringe of the problem and they have made representations to the Department of Health for Scotland that under the present 50% grant arrangement the deficit en the schemes falling on the rates is greater than they can reasonably ask the ratepayers to bear.    (The deficit ranges from about  16 to  17 per house -half of which is borne by the Exchequer and half by the local rates.     Under the 1924 Act the local rates may only have to contribute  4.10.-. per house).If substantial progress is to be made it seems inevitable that the slum clearance grant will have to be materially increased.     It may not be practicable at the moment to determine the precise amount of the increase and, besides,, there may be other questions arising under slum clearanoe conditions and procedure which will require to be explored before a satisfactory scheme can be introduced, but I am strongly of opinion that an early opportunity should be taken of making an announcement that the Government have a revised slum clearance scheme under(consideration and that this will include the giving of more favourable financial terms to local authorities who proceed with schemes.The second reading speech on the Housihg Bill proposed by the Minister of Health would appear to afford a suitable opportunity for such an announcement.Scottish Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.21st June, 1929.WM. ADAMSON.
