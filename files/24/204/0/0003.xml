API 01 HELD GUARDIAKS l/flDSR  TEE GDAECPIAKS ( DEFAULT)  .ACT.LEhPRAliDlJM PY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.(29).Copy Ho.1It ie necessary for me to consalt my colleagues without delay as tc the action which should be tahan as regards the Guardiens appointed by the late Government in supersession of elected Guardians under the Guardians (Default) Act. 1926 --now section 220 of the Poor lew Consolidation -act,. 1927.These Guardians ere installed in the three Unions of West Ham, Bedwellty and Chester-le-Street. In each case they ere three in number, paid ss follows -In V/est Ham,In BeclwalltyOne One OneOne Two 1,500In Chester-le-Streot     Three976.7 672.19t8f)0500 each 500 eachper annumper annum per annump er annum p cr annumper annumSection 220 of the Poor Law Consolidation Act, 1927, provides that tho Minister may by Order extend the term of office for periods not exceeding 5 months.      Such an Order has to be laid before Parliament and may be annulled by an Address presented within 21 days by either House,In each of the three cases mentioned the appointed guardians have been continued in office up to the 3oth June, 1929 cSection 22o contemplates that when &quot;appointed&quot; guardians cease to act there should be an election of
guardians to take their place.     The Local Government Act, 1929, however, provides generally that Boards of Guardians shall cease to exist from let April, 1930, and, incidentally to the change &amp;ver, it enacts that there shall he no elections of guardians after lBt of April, 1929,As from the 1st of April, 1930, I should propose that the three Unions should he dealt with like any other Union under the general provisions of the Local Gdvernment Act, 1929, for the abolition of Boards of Guardians, and that recourse should not he had to the power given &quot;by section 20 of that Act to continue appointed guardians up to the 1st of April, 1935, Provision has to be made, therefore, for the period from the end of this month to the 1st of April, 1930, and it will be necessary either to legislate or to continue appointed guardians in some form by order under section 220 of the Act of 1927,There is, in any event, no time for legislation before the end of this month and there must, therefore, be an order to meet the immediate needs of the situation.     In all the circumstances I think it will be best to continue procedure by order over the whole period up to 1st April, 1930,     This means that two orders at least will have to be made, as the maximum currency of an order under the statute is six months.There will be insufficient time after the Cabinet decision to make any change as from the end of this month and it will be neoessaryf$i* metoissue an order continuing the present appointed guardians for some period.     One nionth would probably be sufficient for the purpose but it will be appreciated that this will mean the issuing of three orders to cover the whole period up to 1st Apr&quot;il, 1930,   Prom the point of view of administrative convenience there is a good deal to be said in favour of allowing the present guardians to c ontir.no till the end of September, which is the end of the accounting
half year.     There will, however, be political objections which may be judged to render that course impracticable and to dictate continuance for one month only as the minimum period required to make the change.As regards tho arrangements to be made for the rest of the period up to 1st April; 1930, the possible courses appear to be ...(a) To reappoint as guardians the persons who wero in office at the time when the appointed guardians were brought in.    Thisis perhaps not practicable and is open to some obvious political objections.(b) To appoint 3 other appointed guardians in each Union, or such larger number, say six, as may be preferable in so large a Union as West Ham.(c) To appoint, at all events in West Ham, a larger Board with the object of getting as close as may be to a Board of the nature, of an elected Board.In favour of alternative (c).it may be pointed out that it brings us as near as the circumstances admit to the restoration of poor law administration by elected Representatives of the people - our root objection to the arrangement made by the late Government was that it was contrary to that principle.    I am, therefore, in favour of alternative (c), as against alternative (b) - this latter course would leave us still infringing the principles and open to ettack oh that ground.On this line the action required would be to approach the local authorities concerned and to request them to nominate a suitable number of persons who would be appointed by order of the Minister to be guardians in the Unions concerned during the period between the disappearance of the present appointed guardians and the 1st of April, 193o.
Under the Local Government Act, 1929, the responsibility for poor law in Chester-le.-Street ana Bedwellty passes to the County Councils of Durham and, Uonmouth respectively, and in these cases I should approach the County Councils and ask them to nominate three persons for eaoh of the two Unions.      In view of the political complexion of these two County Councils, there should be no difficulty in obtaining their acquiescence - in these case Si three persons should sufficeiThe case of West Ham is more difficult.    Under the Local Government Act, 1929,  the Union will be dividec1, the county boroughs of West end East Hem taking over those parts of the Union Which are within their bound eries, and the remainder of the Union coming under the Couuty Council of Essex.I am advised that this County Council would most probably decline to be associated with the two county boroughs since its political complexion is different end its nominees might very well be in a. permanent minority.In the circumstances I think in this case the best course will be to apj.roe.ch the two county boroizghs and the other local authorities inside the present Union.Particulars of population and rateable value of these authorities are as followsPopulation.        Rateable Value. West Ham 315,400 1,428,504.East Ham 147,2oo 644,487loyton 128,92o 566,998Waltliani3tow 129,395 529,165v/anstead 15,297 153,819Wood ford 21.245 138.280.  757,457 3,461,053
In the ease of the West Han Union, I think (and the Parliamentary Secretary who is well acquainted with the area-agrees) that there should be more than three guardians, to secure a fuller acquaintance on the part of the guardians with the particulars of the individual caoe3.    We consider in fact that at least ten guardians are required.It will be necessary, I think, to allow each individual authority to nominate at least one   guardian and in this particular case the nominees of V/anstead and Woodford would probably exercise a salutary steadying influence on some of their colleagues.    If one nomination is allowed to each of these authorities, it would, I think, be necessary to contemplate a Board of twelve and not ten, four from West H&amp;m and two each from East Ham, Leyton and Welthamstow.     A Board of twelve is on the large side, but it is a case of balancing inconveniences and on the whole I recommend it.If the Cabinet approve these proposals, I should summon e conference of all the authorities, explain the situation, and request them to nominate on the basis proposed.I should add that I propose to discontinue the payment of salaries to the appointed guardians and to provide remuneration based on reasonable travelling and subsistence allowances and allowance for broken time.A.G.15th June, 1929.
