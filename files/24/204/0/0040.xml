S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).9 9 1v p.; 1FT..1193 (29).CABINET. LAND DRAINAGE BILL.Copy No.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesI desire to bring to the notice of my colleagues a problem which, though not of major importance, is extremely urgent.     It arises in connection with the election of members of Drainage Boards.   Section 67 of the Local Government Act 1929 provides that agricultural land and buildings shall be deemed to have no rateable value for the purposes of any current valuation lists, and that no particulars of such land and buildings shall be included In any subsequent lists.     This difficulty was not apparent when the provisions of the Act were under consideration in the form of a Bill.In the case of certain elective Drainage Boards constituted under the general law and also in the case of at least one local Act, if a poll is ever demanded (which as a matter of fact is the exception rather than the rule), the electors are severally entitled to one or more votes according to the rateable value upon which their property is rated, in conformit?/ with a scale set out in section 69(2) of the Land Drainage Act, 1861.The local Act referred to above provides that the rateable values shall be the values as assessed to the poorsrate, and, in consequence of section 67 of the Act of 1929, the majority of the hereditaments in the areas of the Authoritieso-onstltuted under this local Act have now no values for thepurposes of the poors rate.There is a further difficulty in the case of the Boardsconstituted under the general law.     The rateable value whichdeoides the number of votes to which an elector is entitled mustbe
be considered to&quot; be the rateable value for the purposes of the sewers rates levied by the Board, ,but a number of these Boards now levy rates upon the basis of acreage (as they ere empowered to do by section 4(1) of the Land Drainage Act, 1918) .     There is accordingly no sewers rate levied upon the rateable value of the several properties, and the scale set out in section 69(2) of the Act of 1861 is inapt li orble. This second difficxilty oan be conveniently dealt with at the same time as the first.      A draft of the proposed Bill is attached.     The Bill is limited to one clause and should be entirely non-controversial in character and is not in any way anticipating the general legislation visualised by the Royal Commission on Land Drainage.I therefore ask the Cabinet to authorise the immediate introduction of the Bill and suggest that this might take place in the House of Lords.N. B.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries 8th July, 1629.
