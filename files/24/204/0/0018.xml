193DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).Under the procedure approved last Session the London County Council (Co-ordination of Passenger traffic) Bill and the London Electric Railway Companies7   (Co-ordination of Passenger Traffic) Bill will, if the Promoters decide to proceed further, &quot;be carried automatically again through their earlier stages in the House of Commons and come up again for Third Readings  in which event It yjould be necessary for me on that occasion to make  some statement as to the Government&apos;s attitude.It will be remembered that the whole question of the co-ordination of the passenger agencies in London was examined by the London and Home Counties Advisory Committee, who presented a report at the end of July, 1927, outlining a scheme for the co-ordinated management of passenger agencies in London (other than the main line railway companies) based on a compulsory pooling of receipts or &quot;common fund&quot;.This report, which is commonly known as the &quot;Blue Report&quot;, left open for further exploration various important aspects of the matter,  including the precise nature of the co-ordinated-management and the financial basis of the Pool,The late Government decided in February, 1928s that it would be impossible to adopt for the ensuing Session either ag r e t., 170 (2fKC A B I NET,THE LONDON TRAFFIC  (CO-ORDINATION)  BILLS.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport,
189London Traffic Bill or the general Road Traffic Bill of which a draft had been circulated..Negotiations continued between representatives of the Advisory Committee and the main line railways but had not progressed far by the end of the summer.     About that time the London County Council and the Underground Group negotiated with one another, with the knowledge of the Minister of Transport, with a view to seeing whether they could reach agreement on the lines of the Blue Report and hew far they could achieve the object of that report by promoting Private Bills enabling them to enter into agreements with one another on the basis of a common management and, to adopt the language of the Blue Report,, &quot;a common fund&quot;.In the result,  Bills were prepared and presented to Parliament,  into the merits or demerits of which I need not enter.It would suffice to point out that I was personally strongly opposed to these Bills and conducted a campaign against them by pamphlet and in my speeches and that I led the opposition to them in the London County Council.      They were hotly contested by the Labour Members in the last House of Commons and received no support from the Liberal benches.      They were an issue at the South Battersea by-election in which we were successful and in my opinion were an important issue in the London constituencies at the General Election.      Many of our supporters who made them a strong subject of attack won their seats and the three most prominent advocates of the Bills in the House of Commons were defeated.
The matter was recently discussed in the London County Council at a meeting from which I was absent, and a Resolution was moved by the Labour Party in the following terms&quot;That, having regard to the emphatic condemnation of the London Traffic Bills by the electors of London as expressed in the recent Parliamentary General Election,, it be an instruction to the Parliamentary Committee not to proceed further with the London County Council (Co-ordination of Passenger Traffic) Bill, 1929.&quot; After debate, this Resolution was rejected by 60 votes to 45 votes.This action of the London County Council has made the position rather more difficult, but I can understand the reluctance of the majority Party in that Council to recede from the position which they have taken up.It appears to me that, even if we were prepared to do so, it would be useless to advise our supporters to give these Bills a Third Reading, even though we could secure amendment in certain particulars and obtain more definite assurances than have yet been given as to the Combine&apos;s willingness to undertake new works.There would be a revolt in our own ranks, while it Is unlikely that the Bills would be supported by the Liberal Party.In my opinion it Is desirable,  If only from the point of view of not exacerbating feeling and prejudicing further dealing with this urgent problem on lines which I should regard as less open to objection, that there should be no further debate in the House of Commons at this stage.      In view of the attitude of the London County Council, this could now only be achieved If the Underground Group decided not to proceed.      I propose at an early date to have a confidential but frank talk with Lord Ashfield on the subject and I should-3-
linistry of Transport, S.W.1.June 24th, 1929.(Intd. )    H.M&apos;.20/6/29be glad of authority to suggest to him that he would be well advised not to attempt to proceed further with his3111 and that no useful purpose would be served byforcing upon the Government the necessity for an expressdecision, which must be adversec      It must be expected thathe would then ask what was the attitude of theGovernment to the problem and in what direction they wereprepared to contemplate a solution.      To this naturalenquiry I should propose to reply that I should be readyat an early date to explore with him and all of the other important Interests concerned the best means of resumingconsideration of a problem which I recognise to be urgent.
