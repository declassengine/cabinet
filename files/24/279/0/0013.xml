THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT *) SECRET,COPY NOQ.P. 815 (58).CABINET.FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA,Cgj^X-Pf-JL letter ?P9jn the jDzechcslovak Minister in London to the sTcreiary..&apos;o&apos;f State for Foreign Affairs.^Circulated at the request of. Secretary of Statefor Foreign J^fairsey^&quot;CZECHOSLOVAK LEGATION, 8, Grosvenor Place, S.W. loSir,The Czechoslovak Government have instructed me to &quot;bring to His Majesty&apos;s   Governments immediate attention the following:The unheard-of sacrifices for the prolongation of European peace which my people are being made to bear in territory,, economics,    pride and,  in fact, in every respect, have somewhat been shifted into the background by the general jubilation over the success of the Munich meetings      I am instructed to bring to His Majesty1s Government&apos;s attention one part of the economic aspect of the situation created by the Four Power decision:We expect about 1,000,000 people, escaping from the ceded territory, to arrive in new Czechoslovakia within the next few days.     We must find employment, shelter and refuge for these victims.     At the same time our industrial coherence Is being thoroughly cut to pieces by these new decisions. Most of the industries remaining in the new Czechoslovakia will be cut off from their resources of raw materials. Many of the industries in the remaining territory have their exclusive market in the ceded territory, etc, etcyJ3
Ever since the Munich verdict, ray Government have been working feverishly to find the best ways and means of facing the future.        In addition to our own experts we have consulted English and other experts who are well acquainted with the economic structure of former Czechoslovakia,    The figure of  30,000,000 sterling has been arrived at as a very conservative estimate in order to establish a basis for new Czechoslovakia5s economic life, in other words,  to enable us to live at all.It is plainly impossible to get this loan in the open market, and my Government feel that His Majestyfs Governments guarantee for a loan of this sort is essential. -The above-mentioned amount;, after all, would have been spent by Great Britain in a very short while if she had had to take part in a war, in the avoiding of which my country is making the utmost sacrifices.,My Government would be very grateful if His Majesty&apos;s Government would instruct Sir Frederick Leith Ross and Mr, Ashton-Gwatkin to discuss this extremely urgent question with our experts.My Government further instruct me to bring to the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government the fact that to our knowledge no decisions have so far been taken concern-ihg my country about the possibility of an outlet to. the sea, railway communications with the outside world, and of the difficulties which are bound to arise in this respect. My Government also hope that this will be discussed withHis Majesty&apos;s Governments experts.i,
May I conclude with saying that the questions I have mentioned are of an extremely urgent character.      If peace and order are to he preserved in my country we &quot;need help and we need it at once, and my Government venture to express the hope that, after all the violent disappointments of the last few days, at least the most urgent aspects of our impending economic ruin should be given sympathetic considerationoThe amount mentioned above has nothing whatever to do with compensation for ceded territory or for the transfer of military and civilian objects and for the immense loss of natural wealth entailed, in the actual ceding of this territoryoI have, e tco (Signed)       JAN MASARYKo
