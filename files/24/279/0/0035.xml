THI.J DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) . SECRET.CP. 255. (38). COPY NO,mNATIONAL   service note by the Minister for Co-ordination, of DefencecI circulate herewith a Memorandum by Sir Ernest Cowers, the Chairman of the Sub-Coinaittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Control of Man-Power.2. I should explain that at the end of September theSub-Committee completed a Report containing recommendations as to the functions which should, be entrusted to the Ministry of National Service in war and the man-power policy to be adopted in war.     Appended to the Report are drafts of the National Service (Armed Forces) Bill and of the Control of Employment Bill.3.       . On the 10th October the Chairman of the Sub-CoimhLttee on the Control of Man-Power reassembled, his Sub-Committee to consider certain lacunae  in this Report which were revealed during the recent emergency. In particular. Sir Ernest Gowers thought that further consideration should be given to the question of guiding and regulating voluntary effort both before a crisis occurs and on its occurrence.4, The Sub-Committee came to the following conclusions:--1-
(l)    That a Handbook on National Service, which should have a foreword by the Prime Minister and give particulars of all the services for which - volunteers are required, should immediately be prepared for wide circulation.      This Handbook would invite persons to volunteer for those services for which they are best suited.(2)    The handbook would inform persons who find difficulty in deciding for which service they should volunteer, that they may apply for advice at the Employment Exchange.(3)    That voluntary registers should bemaintained at the Employment Exchanges of persons for whom no place can be found at present in the existing services, but who would, be willing to undertake any suitable service if called upon.(4)    That the Ministry of Labour should maintain a central voluntary register for people with professional or other special qualifications who would beprepared to undertake work of a specialised char-actcr in the event of war.    This work would largely be carried out through the professional bodies concerned.(5)    That a compulsory National Register would only be of value as a prelude to compulsory-National Service.5. The Sub-Committee is now engaged on elaboratinga scheme on the above lines, and the material for the proposed handbook is being collected from the department concerned.      I anticipate, however, that it may be necessary to give an indication of Government policy in this matter at an early date in the new Session of Parliament.      I, therefore, asked Sir Ernest Gowers to prepare a Memorandum explaining in outline the scheme which is being drawn up by his Committee, in order to give my colleagues an early opportunity of expressing their views on the general issue of policy involved.
2^0W KS V6. With reference to the concluding sentence ofparagraph 4 of Sir Ernest Gower&apos;s Memorandum, I should add that I have reached the conclusion that when the Government policy in this matter is explained to Parliament, it will he necessary that the Government spokesman should give information to Parliament on one matter on which hitherto no announcement has been made. I refer to the Schedule of Reserved Occupations.7. I do not suggest it would he necessary to giveParliament any details as to the occupations included in the Schedule.     The Schedule (which contains all the occupations which are of vital importance to wartime industries, and industries and services essential to the maintenance of the life of the community) represents the machinery which the Government have devised to prevent persons, who, in the national interest, would be better employed in their existing occupations, from leaving those occupations to join the armed forces or   -to take up other whole-time war service.      The existence of the Schedule is, therefore, an answer to those critics who fear that the Government have taken no steps to prevent the dislocation of essential industries in wartime.8. It is to he hoped that the appeal for volunteersnow proposed will meet with a wide response.     Provided this is the case, the measures now proposed,  taken in conjunction with the Schedule of Reserved Occupations, should, go as far as * is practicable to ensure that
every person who is prepared to offer his services is employed in the sphere of activity in which he can he most useful to his country.      The announcement of the existence of the Schedule would, therefore, go far to reassure public opinion, and to take the wind out of the sails of those critics who are most insistent in urging the establishment of a National Register, and I cannot see how the announcement of the existence of the Schedule of Reserved Occupations can. now be avoided.(Intd.)

NATIONAL SERVICE.MEMORANDUM BY CHAIRMAN OP SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE,CONTROL OF MAN-POWER.The Committee have already concluded that the possible advantages of a compulsory National Register were three; first, that,  if it were in existence at the outbreak of war, and were fresh enough to be accurate,  it would serve as the basis for the issue of food cards; secondly,  that it would serve to identify the individuals to be called up under any compulsoryscheme of military service; and, thirdly, that it would afford,Istatistical material on which to frame policy in the event of j a long war which made a drain on the man-power of the country.;  .. These advantages depend, of course, upon its being a prelude to a compulsory system.2. But the case for an immediate compulsory National Registeris now being argued in some quarters on other grounds.      These grounds are not specified with clarity or precision, but the general argument seems to be that only in this way can the most effective use be made of the country&apos;s man-power, even under a voluntary system.      In examining this suggestion it is necessary to bear in mind two fundamental facts; first, that broadly speaking,  it will only be those who have prepared themselves beforehand for a particular task who will be of. use during the initial crisis of a future war; secondly, that, on present assumptions about the role of the army,  there will at that time be a surplus of man-power: not everyone can be used.3. The taking of.&apos;a compulsory National Register wouldmean that we should have a complete Register (or rather a i, jnumber of Registers for different geographical areas linked to a central Register) of the whole,adult population, or such part of it as it might be decided to enumerate.      People
O C 960 awill be classified according to their ages and occupations, as returned by themselves,  and presumably also particulars will beTecorded of any form of national service to which anyone has already committed himself.    So far as these last are concerned,. the Register would tell us nothing that we did not know already.    Everyone who has already allotted . himself to some form of national service is already on the roll of the appropriate authority:    for them a Register already exists.    The only things therefore, that the compulsory National Register would have given over arid above a voluntary Register would be the names and occupations of a large number of people who have net yet undertaken any form of national service.    We do not understand how any use could be made of this information under a voluntary system.    In short, we cannot see any argument by which a compulsory National Register can be justified,, except as a prelude to some sort of compulsion.    So long as we rely on the voluntary system the sensible thing for us to do would seem to be to concentrate on stimulating people to volunteer and seeing that the willing are allotted to suitable tasks, rather than to dissipate our energies by trying to identify the unwilling.4. It is for this purpose that we think that a Handbookto National Service should, at once be pre; ared for wide, distribution.    It should contain a Foreword by the Prime Minister, which should lay special emphasis on the point that, since a future war would be of a sort that would call for instant mobilisation of all our defensive resources, it is not a bit of use for people to wait until it is imminent before offering their services:    they must prepare themselves now to play whatever part is most suitable to them.    It
should then eraatriaripe in separate sections all the purposes for which men or women are wanted, giving age limits, qualificationsj  and where volunteers should enrol.    It should also stress the fact that there will he many who can serve best by remaining at their jobs and give some indication of the Schedule of Reserved Occupations.5. It nhould further state that,, for those who are willing to volunteer in time of war but cannot enrol in any particular service in time of peace,, registers will be opened at selected Employment Exchanges, which will classify such volunteers according to their qualifications.    This organisation should be under the supervision of a staff at the Ministry of labour which would automatically become part of the Ministry of National Service and would itself keep a central register of volunteers who, by their scientific or other qualifications;, would be more suitable for allocation by a central authority than locally.    Indeed the nucleus of such a staff and such a register already &apos; exists.    It is suggested too thats as part of the organisation local National Service Committees should be set up to advise volunteers.    They would be analogous to War Savings Committees and King&apos;s Roll Committees.6. The preparation&apos; of the proposed handbook has alreadybeen begun.(Signed)    E.A, COWERS. 21st October, 1933.
