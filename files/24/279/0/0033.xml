Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 233 (38).CABINET.BILL TO AMEND THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ACT, 1935.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I HAVE to seek the approval of my colleagues to a proposal to amend the Government of India Act, 1935, during the coming session. I am not yet in a position to say when I shall be ready to propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take the steps contemplated by the Act for the inauguration of Federa-tion a process which, when the time comes, will almost certainly necessitate a very full debate in both Houses on the motion for an Address to the Crown, together with a&quot; certain amount of time for subsidiary action (the approving of certain Orders in Council and of the Instructions to be issued to the Governor-General, &amp;&apos;c). This will certainly not, however, occur before the session 1939-40. Having regard to the probability of perhaps somewhat lengthy debates on India during that session, I am reluctant to make demands for time for India during the coming session. But I think that the passage of the Bill I contemplate should require but little Parliamentary time and raise little controversy here. The main reason for my request is that the first six amendments which I propose shortly to describe must be given retrospective effect to 1st April, 1937 the date on which the provisions of the Act now in operation came into force. This makes it very desirable that the Amending Bill should become law not later than the summer recess of 1939, since, granted the necessity for these amendments, it would be hardly becoming to ask Parliament to legislate retrospectively over a longer period.2.   The amendments I contemplate are as follows :  (1) To amend the definition of &quot; corporation tax &quot;&apos;in s. 311 of the Act.The definition has been found to have the unintended effect of sweeping into the category of the corporation tax the income-tax as well as the super-tax paid by companies, thus making exclusively Federal considerable, sums which ought to be shared with the Provinces. This defect in the Act has, in fact, been ignored in calculating the share of the Provinces from 1937 onwards, but the action of the Government of India in so doing lacks, of course, proper legal authority.(2) To declare more precisely the scope and effect of the expression in s. 138 (1) of the Act &quot; the proceeds of taxes on income attributable to Chief Commissioners&apos; Provinces.&quot;Sir Otto Niemeyer in the recommendations following on his. financial investigation which preceded the coming into force of the 4 Act, adopted a formula for the allocation of income-tax which involves the assignment of a definite value to the share of the Chief Commis-sioners&apos; Provinces; it is necessary, owing to the interdependence of the various factors, to give his recommendation in this respect the same statutory force as has already been given to the rest of his scheme.(3) To declare that a tax on the consumption of electricity is not to be regarded as an excise duty and consequently within the purview of[18080]
the Central Government, but as a tax on sales and therefore as falling within the Provincial legislative List.At the instance of the Bengal Government I committed myself some months ago, in answer to a question in the House of Commons, to legislate to this effect at the earliest opportunity, with a view to discouraging suits in the Courts which they feared might be success-fully brought by consumers for a declaration that the legislation recently passed in Bengal to continue the electricity duty- an important source of revenue to that and other provincial Governments  was invalid.(4) To regularise certain appointments and promotions irregularly made in the India Office before 1st April, 1937.Under the Government of India Act, now repealed, the strength and remuneration of the staff of the India Office and of the Auditor of Home Accounts were respectively regulated by Order in Council and by Warrant. For many years, I understand, it had been the practice which hardly, perhaps, complied with the strict require-ments of the law- for the Secretary of State in Council himself as occasion required to sanction changes in the strength or salaries of his staff and, at convenient intervals, to obtain from His Majesty in Council a retrospectively confirmatory Order : and a similar practice prevailed with respect to the staff of the Auditor. Unfortunately, at the time when the new Act came into force and the provisions in question were repealed, certain changes which had been made in the course of the previous three or four years had not been ratified by a revision of the relevant Order in Council and of the Warrant; and once the old Government of&quot; India Act was repealed it became impossible to repair this omission, which affects the legal right to pension of certain individuals, otherwise than by legislation.(5) To provide for the payment from Federal or Provincial revenues^ as the case may be, of pensionary contributions in respect of their Indian service to members of the Home Civil Service appointed to be Governors, Members of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council [and to certain other offices in India] and to &apos;&apos; charge &apos;&apos; those payments upon Federal or Provincial revenues, i.e., to make them not subject to the vote of the Legislature.It has been not uncommon for members of the Home Civil Service to be appointed to the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council, most commonly in the capacity of Finance Member, the existing Finance Member Sir James Grigg being a case in point; and in one instance  that of Sir John Anderson a member of the Home Civil Service has been appointed to be Governor of a Province. It has hitherto been assumed that a rule or order made by the Secretary of State was sufficient authority for declaring these posts to be pensionable in the case of such holders, thus enabling the Treasury rule as to shared pensions to be applied to them and a proportion of the pension which they earn as Home Civil Servants being accordingly paid by India. Doubts have been raised, however, as to the validity for the purpose in view of a ruling to this effect by the Secretary of State, and, in any case, it is certain that any pension contribution paid from India to a Civil Servant after his retirement would, unlike any other pension of persons in a similar position, have to be voted annually by the Legislature.- It is essential to remove any doubts on this matter with the least possible delay, since the pension actually being paid by the Treasury to Sir John Anderson lacks in respect of its Indian portion proper legal authority.(6) To provide by alteration of the Lists of Subjects for the taxation of motor vehicles as a Provincial matter.The Lists as they stand leave open to much doubt the right of any authority in India to tax motor vehicles and, assuming such a right to exist, the question whether it resides in the Central or the Provincial Legislature. Accordingly, existing legislation on the subject is liable to be upset by the Courts as ultra vires with results which might be very embarrassing for more than one Province.
(7) To empower the Governor-General to make temporary appointments of acting Judges of the Federal Court.Only three regular Judges of the Federal Court have so far been appointed, and, although the maximum permissible number is six, it is not at present intended to make further appointments. The Act is defective, however, in that, while it provides that every case must be tried by not less than three Judges, it makes no provision such as is made in the case of the High Courts for the appointment of a temporary Judge to take the place of a Judge who is temporarily incapacitated by ill health. The result might be to bring the work of the Court to a standstill. The Act as it stands enables the Governor-General to appoint one of the Judges of the Court to act as Chief Justice in the case of the temporary incapacity of the permanent Chief Justice and, following this analogy, it is proposed to empower him further to appoint a duly qualified person to act as Judge in a temporary vacancy.- (8) To revise the definition of &quot; Indian State &quot; in s. 311 of the Act, which has been found to be seriously defective.3. These eight amendments of the Act seem to me essential and urgent. But, as might be expected in the case of an Act so long and complex, other points have disclosed themselves since it was passed in which it is capable of improve-ment. To some of the amendments required for this purpose the formal assent of every Federated State would have to be obtained if their enactment were to be postponed until after the inauguration of Federation. The Governor-General and I are anxious, from the point of view of Indian political reactions, to confine the Bill to which I am now seeking my colleagues&apos; approval within the narrowest possible limits. But we are examining the further suggested amend-ments referred to in this paragraph, and more particularly those which under the provisions of the Act would require the assent of the States if they were not effective before Federation; and I would ask that the agreement in principle to the introduction of a Bill which I am seeking should be accorded to a Bill containing the provisions described in paragraph 2 of this memorandum, with liberty to myself (in agreement with the Governor-General), should this seem expedient, to add certain further amendments of the kind described in the present paragraph. 1 think I can safely say that none of these latter would give ground for controversy here, and that many, if not most, of them could be included in a Schedule to the Bill to be covered by a clause describing them as &quot;minor amendments.&quot;4. I have already indicated my belief that none of the amendments 1 propose should prove to be controversial here. The same cannot be said of their effects in India, where they will, no doubt, be attacked by the Congress Party as trivial alterations which leave untouched the more drastic changes they purport to regard as essential to their willing co-operation in the working of the Act; and it is, I admit, npt impossible that the Labour Opposition may take the same line here. Further, any amendment of the Act weakens our case for refusing to consider demands for further amendments to meet their point of view which the Princes may make in answer to the terms on which their accession to the Federation will be accepted which are about to be set before them. For these reasons, there would have been obvious advantages in avoiding amending legisla-tion altogether until after the Federation had been inaugurated. I have, however, given my reasons for thinking that that course is impossible.5. Accordingly, I have to request that the Cabinet will approve, in principle, the introduction of a Bill to amend the Government of India Act, 1935, in time (say, in February next) to admit of its passage into law before the summer recess, 1939, and agree that the scope of the Bill should be as described in paragraph 2 of this memorandum, subject to any modifications of detail and to any additional provisions of the kind described in paragraph 3 of this memorandum which further discussion with the Government of India may indicate to be desirable and to approval by the Home Affairs Committee in due course of the actual terms of the Bill.Z.India Office, October 21, 1938.
