SECRET. -CP.  285 (38).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND AGRICULTURE. THE UNITED KINGDOM - UNITED STATES TRADE AGREEMENT.REPORT.1.       We attach (Appendix I to   this Report) a Memorandum circulated to us &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade (T.A.C. (36) 56) dealing with the latest American consolidated list of&apos; requests.    We have examined this Memorandum and have decided that the main question of policy, whether we should now give the Americans our final offer and be prepared to break if it is not accepted, should toe reserved for consideration in the Cabinet.    On this point the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs circulated to the Committee a telegram from the Ambassador at Washington (copy annexed as Appendix II to this Report) expressing the view that it would be unwise to face a breakdown of the negotiations on these demands.2.       We concur generally with the conclusions of the President of the Board of Trade on the individual items of the United States list.    Apart from maize, which everyone is agreed can toe given without sacrifices and anthracite, Y/hich. I is put forward, not as part of the final list, but as an&quot;earnest plea&quot;, the requests which may be classed as important, (i.e. of sufficient importance to toe likely to influence the United States Government when considering whether or not to sign an Agreement) are ham,, tohacco, wheat flour, planed softwood, plywood, lard and possibly motor cars.    On these our general conclusion is that we can, if absolutely necessary,Copy No.   r*g(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .
and if we are assured that it will clinch the &quot;bargain, accede to the American request on lard, and that a formula can probably be found to meet the Americans on tobacco, but that the other requests must be refused for the reasons given in the President&apos;s memorandum. &apos;In particular, we have had regard to the following considerations:-AnthracIta,     The concession would, adversely affect South Wales, which is a seriously depressed, area.      Concessions on tinplate have already been made in our preference in Canada which affect particularly South Wales, and a further blow to this area could not be contemplated^      The request is, In any case not one on which the Americans appear to expect any concession-Ham.      The request would, in effect, commit the Treasury to continuing the bar-n price guarantee after the end of the three-year period provided for in the Bacon Industry Act. This would be an unwarrantable interference with joint? internal policy besides involving the Treasury in an incalculable financial obligationoWheat flour.      The, danger is continental competition and we -could not preclude ourselves from increasing the very low duty of 10 per cento if it became necessary to meet the corn-petition of low-priced flour from the continent.Planed...softwood and; plywood.,     The United States supplied in 1937 only 5 and- 8 per cent, respectively of the imports which would be covered by the tariff reductions that would be necessary to meet their demands, and. the sacrifice of revenue would be out of all proportion to the possible benefit to United States trade.Motor cars.   &apos; There is danger of German subsidised corn-petition in cars between SO and 25 hop.      The British motor industry will dislike the concession already offered and would greatly resent any further extension.
The remaining requests,  namely,  those in respect of electric motors, typewriters and silk stockings, are of less importance and should,  in our. view, he rejected for the reasons given in the Presidents Memorandum.,3o Our conclusions may he summarised as follows:-(i)   The main question of policy, whether we should now give the Americans our final offer and be prepared to break off negotiations for a trade agreement if that offer is not accepted is reserved for consideration by the Cabinet,(ii)    If the Cabinet decide in favour of a final offer being now made, we recommend that that offer should deal with the latest American consolidated list of requests as follows: -(a)   Maize:    the request for convention-alisation of free entry should be granted,(&apos;D)    Lard:    if absolutely necessary, andif we are assured that it will clinch the bargain, this request for free entry should be grantedo(c) T.Si^ LQ.Q.-    wo should? as proposed by the&quot;President of the Board of Trade, offer a formula which it is hoped that the Americans will accepto(d) the other requests concerning items of importance, namely, hams, wheat flour, planed softwood,&apos; plywood and motor-cars, should be refused as should also the requests in regard to items of minor importance, i.e., electric motors, typewriters and silk stockings.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeJOHN SIMON,Chairman,,Treasury Chambers, S0W.lo 14th October,  1938o
CRBT. COPY NO.__A.C.(36)56.CABINET.COMIvilTTEE ON TRADE AND AG-agriculutre.&apos;UNITED KING-DOM-UNI TED STATUS TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. Note &quot;by the President of the Boardjjf Trade.The negotiations with the U.S.A. have now reached a stage at which it is necessary to report the position once more to the Committee.    Since I last reported on 16th July (T.A.C.(36)53) there has been little change in the situation;    the time of the Delegation for the last three months having been taken up almost exclusively in dealing with demands of the U.S. Government for further concessions on primary products, mainly timber, tobacco, rice, lard and hams.    In the end the Americans have produced a consolidated list of demands which are summarised in the telegrams from the Delegation copies of which are appended to this Note (Appendix I).Bsfore dealing with these demands in detail I should say that the balance of the Agreement described in my previous note has? apart from minor items in the U.K. list and not unsubstantial further concessions in the Colonies, been changed in favour of the U. S. A. by:-(1) the acceptance in principle of a scheme of reductions in duty on hewn and sawn soft wood (imports from U.8.A- . in 1936 valued at  1,150,000).    Details are still under discussion.    The scheme by a complicated system of values ^and sizes confines the main benefit of the reduction to t    the U.S.A. without infringing bur most-favoured-nation obligations to other countries. (2) the offer of a reduction in the duty on rice from Id, per pound to ^/3d. per pound.    This, has aroused much resentment and will involve a serious sacrifice of preferences in our***
new agreement with Burma.    It will also &quot;be criticised by the Rice milling industry here  (since they mill Burma rice, whereas American rice arrived fully milled) and by Australia who have developed a large trade in rice since Ottawa, though they have no guaranteed preference.(5) the guarantee of a considerably larger quota of hams, which has involved long and difficult negotiations with Denmark and Poland (who already possess guaranteed rights in the matter of imports of bacon and hams) and has left both countries with a sense of dissatisfaction and has lost us some of their goodwill.(4)  the reduction of the duty on track-laying tractors from 33i% to 25^.    The Committee will remember from the last discussion on this subject, the great difficulty we had in-making this c one ess ion .Not content with these additional concessions the Americans have now produced their consolidated list of final demands. These demands and my comments and recommendations on them are set out in Appendix II.The Committee will see that the United States demands are far reaching and, with the exception of those on- maize and possible;^ lard, are to my mind quite unacceptable.    Experience over the last three months has shown that the grant of a concession by us has been followed, not by the display of a reasonable spirit and a withdrawal of other demands, but by a flood of further demands.    I have no doubt therefore that we should treat this consolidated list afdemands as a final list and should answer by the offer of what we can concede and a definite intimation that that is the full extent of our -concessions.    If the United. States G-overnment are not willing to conclude an Agreement on the basis thus reached, we must, with great regret, recall our Delegation and announce the breakdown, of the negotiations.
It will be difficult enough to convince this country that a bargain on the basis I propose is fair, particularly in the light of the fact that in the first eight months of this year we imported  80 million worth of goods from U.S.A. and exported  12 million re-exports being  5? million, and any further concessions can only increase the difficulty.   A further difficulty is that the public will be almost certain to seize on the fact that, in spite of reductions, American duties will still remain in the region of 30% or 40$ (and in some cases higher) whereas the general level of our reduced duties will be in the region of 10$ or lb%*I am quite aware of the political considerations involved, but I am now convinced that the harm which would be done to our prestige and to our material interests in the holding up of trade &quot;by a further prolongation of these negotiations would outweigh any damage which could accrue from a failure to reach agreement. As my colleagues are aware, I have attached great importance to the successful outcome of an attempt to reach a comprehensive trade agreement with the United States of America and I still think that such an Agreement would have immense value.   But we can neither5 wait for ever nor pay a price out of all proportion to the benefits we are to receive;    and I think we should no?/ make our position quite plain and insist on a definite decision by the United States Government to conclude the Agreement or to break off negotiations.O.F.G.S.Board of Tr&amp;de,10th October, 1938.BHWWBHMMW
APPENDIX I.telegrams from Sir R* Lindsay (Washington)dated 6th October, 1958. ^--. --No.  217.IMMEDIATE.Following for Board of Trade from Delegation: 1. At Sayre&apos;s request we saw him today.      He said that . improvement on our offers, particularly on agricultural items, was essential to an agreement.      They had however refrained from asking for anything which would entail consent of third countries. He referred&apos; particularly to tobacco and said it was only with the greatest reluctance that Mr. Hull had been persuaded to endorse their new proposal.     He added&apos;that they were also offering us some additional concessions on Schedule 4.      He then handed, us:(a) covering letter from Mr. Hull(b) explanatory memorandum running to 36 pages(c) re-draft of Agreement,  and(d) letter regarding anthracite.2. The following is an extract from Mr. Hull&apos;s letter to the Ambassador, begins:&quot;I am sure that you would wish me to be completely frank. I am not prepared to sign an agreement which does not include more comprehensive concessions on the part of yourjGovernment. The position taken by your Government regarding Empire commitments seriously limits the possibilities for improving that part pf tbe Agreement.      Nevertheless, there are several instances, as indicated in attached memorandum,  in which improvements not involving further Empire consultation should be possible.      In my opinion these improvements are indispensable to us in ODtainirg popular support for the Agreement.      I am prepared to sign an agreement which includes the changes suggested in this memorandi^m&apos;1 . Ends.3. On anthracite request is for free entry into Canada during&apos; December to April inclusive and is in the form of an earnest plea
that this question he reconsidered with a view to allowing Canadian Government to grant this limited concession to an important American, product.4. Schedule 1 - agricultural etc,  items.Following are the main points:-Rice.    Two-thirds of a penny accepted.Maize.    Other than flat. white, re-conventionalization of free entry.Hams.    Our proposal accepted subject to deletion of three-year limitation.Tobacco.      See my immediately following telegram.Wheat-flour.    Binds 10 per cent duty and agrees to passage in minute corresponding with that in dried and canned fruits that sympathetic consideration will be given to such reduction in duty as Australia might accept.&quot;Lumber.    Proposals as recently reported,  including concessions on planed or dressed, valued at  20 or more per standard.Pl3rwood.   Reduction to 5 per cent on soft wood plywood. 5. Schedule 1 - industrial items.      It is stated that certain industrial requests in Schedule 1 cannot be abandoned.     The more important are as follows?Electric motors.    15 per cent on those weighing less than 80 pounds (said to correspond to 1 horse-power)..Typewriters.;   4-bank portable machines  1.12s. Od. . each.It is explained that according to United States figures they supplied nearly 5,000 of these machines in the first five months of this year instead of 1,500 which our figures showed.Motor cars.      Binding down to 20 horse-power.Silk stockings.      Assurance if necessary in minute that existing percentage margin of preference will not be increased.6. Schedule 4,      Only improvement of importance not previously contemplated is offer of 40 per cent on wooden fabrics-2-
.lo3of between SO and 125 cents per pound under paragraph 1109A instead of per cent, with contingent reduction to 4-0 per cent.IMMEDIATE&apos;;Following for Board of Trade from. Delegation. My immediately preceding telegram.1.  Text of note in Schedule I on unmanufactured tobacco is as follows:   -Begins.    Although Government of United Kingdom were unable &quot;because of contractual obligations to certain Dominions and India which will not expire until August 1942, to comply with request of Government of United States for an immediate reduction by one shilling per pound of present differences between rates of duty applicable to unmanufactured tobacco   -originating in United States of America arid rates of duty applicable to like article of British Empire origin,  the Government of United Kingdom shall subject to the approval of the Cabinet and Parliament reduce such differences &quot;by that amount when afore-mentioned obligations expire in 1942. Meanwhile    such differences shall not be increased&apos;.      Ends.2. In covering memorandum the United States Government state that they have abandoned request for a reservation concerning compensatory withdrawals of concessions if preference for Empire tobacco is not reduced in 1942.      After tracing the history- of the negotiations on this subject and referring to outstanding importance of tobacco, memorandum states that United States Government cannot accept a proposal to defer until a later date negotiations involving this important objective which concessions offered&apos;by United States.in Schedule IV are intended to make possible.      Memorandum claims that present provision in
respect of tobacco making reduction subject to approval of Cabinet and Parliament fully meets objection raised to earlier proposal, which involved binding a future Government.3. We propose to telephone to you-   tomorrow about 4 o&apos;clock Greenwich time.
APPENDIX II. COMMENTS ON T.T. 8.   CONSOLIDATED LIST OP REQUESTS.Anthracite (Telegram No.217); The request is for free entry into Canada from December to April inclusive:    our consent is necessary as the margin of preference to the United Kingdom is guaranteed in the United Kingdom-Canada Trade Agreement, 1937.I do not understand that this demand is put forward as more than an &quot;earnest plea&apos;&apos;.      A concession on this item would involve a serious loss of trade in a market of vital importance to South Tales and I am not prepared to recommend that any concession should &quot;be offered.Maize. The request is for conventionalisation of free entry; this is already conventionalised in the United Kingdom-Argentine Agreement,  1936.    I see no objection to this proposal,, although it is new.Lard. The request, which was accidentally omitted from telegram No.217, is for free entry.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 28th July last (Cabinet 56(38) Conclusion 3) we have already offered to reduce the duty from 10$ to 2/6d a cwt.    While I do not think til ere is a case on merits for a further concession, I think that the grant of free entry might just turn the scale and induce the Americans to conclude an Agreement, since the Americans aopear to attach disproportionate value to it. As I understand the position, the effect of the reduction of dutyt upon the level of imports is likely to toe slight.    The bacon industry is to &quot;be-protected toy the Treasury, guarantee and any additional loss to the Exchequer on this account would probably be small.    The main loss would toe to the Customs revenue which might be as much as . 300,000 next year (assuming an import of 2.4 million cwts..)
On the other hand, while I understand that the producers of compound lard consider that they are now so strongly entrenched that they would not &quot;be afraid of some increased competition frtmi animal lard, this would not be likely to prevent them from protesting strongly if they were to he deprived of the whole of their protection against imported animal lard.      Nevertheless,  if the Chancellor of the Exchequer is willing to face the financial loss involved,  I, for my p&apos;art, should he inclined to recommend that this concession might &quot;be offered.Hams.    The request is for the deletion of the time limit in the quantitative guarantee.    The Americans have throughout attached great importance to being able to say that there is now no obstacle to an increase in their shipments to substantially    pre-quota level (their original request for 700,000 cwts.) and this they cannot say on the present formula,  although it includes a very substantial increase (to 500,000 cwts.  from a quota of about 400,000 cwts.    in 1937 and a performance of just over 300,000 ewts.).The concession already made has been limited to three years because the Treasury guarantee to the bacon industry under the Bacon Industry Act 1938 operates only for three years.    To enter into a commitment, to the U.S.A. extending indefinitely the offer already made would mean that we should almost certainly have to continue the Treasury guarantee beyond the three years laid down in the Act.    It would upset the principle of the Act which is that the Bacon industry should become independent, &apos;by the end of three years,  of direct Tr&amp;asury support,  while remaining protected by a regulation of imports.    There is a precedent for quantitative guarantees limited in duration in the Argentine Agreement (on meat). Tobacco.    The request is that the Government of the United Kingdom shall sub j ect to the approval of the ..Cabinet and Parliament  reduce the margin of preference by 1/- per pound, in 1942.
It is difficult to attach any intelligent meaning to the text of the proposal (which will be found in para. 1 of telegram No.213) but so far as I can understand it, the proposal appears to beHhat His Majesty&apos;s present Government undertake that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament as they exist in 1942 agree, the margin of preference shall be reduced in August 1942 by Is. a pound.      (The present preference is, roughly,  2s. a pound;.This proposal is fantastic.    If, as I understand from a telephone conversation with l*lr. Overt on at Washington, the intention is that the undertaking is to mean nothing but to be used to allay the apprehensions of the American tobacco interests, I am not prepared to recommend that we should give an undertaking that is intended to be deceptive and can, in practice, provoke nothing but derision.    If,  on the other hand the undertaking is intended to mean something - and I do not exclude that possibility - it could only mean that, if the present Government are in power in 1942, we should be under a moral obligation to carr:/ out the reduction of the.margin of. -preference and to do our best to obtain parliamentary authority to do so.    This is an impossible obligation.I propose therefore that we should refuse to go further than the concessions which we have already offered - i.e,  an undertaking (l) that the margin of preference will not be increased and (2) that the U.3.Government will be consulted when the future of the preference after 1942 is under consideration.Wheat fflour.    The request - which is new - is for consolidation of * the 10$ duty.      The Americans earlier asked for a reduction of duty and later dropped it.If the only flour concerned was American flour I myself should not see grave objection to acceding to the request for conventionalisation of the duty, particularly as the
appearance of flour in the schedule would bring into effect the provisions about dumping in the draft agreement.    The real danger in this proposal however conies, not from American flour, which is hlgn in price,  but from cheap Continental flour, and I am not prepared to suggest that we should tie our hands in such a way as to make impossible further defence against such flour.As regards the proposal involving Australia the answer is that this is not a case in which our obligation to Australia is the only obstacle.      Our own millers are equally concerned, and Canada (although they have no treaty rights in the matter) have said that a concession on flour would make their acceptance of the removal of the wheat duty much more difficult. I think that the whole proposal should be rejected.Timber.    The request is that the concessions already offered should be extended to cover planed softwood valued at more than  20 a standard..    Total imports of hewn,  sawn and planed softwood from U.S.A.  in 1956 were  1,200,000.    Over 96$ of        . this was hewn and sawn, on which we have offered generous concessions.    On planed softwood which constitutes the remaining 4$ they have less than ^% by quantity and less than 1$ by value of total imports.    Even within the value limit suggested, imports from U.S.A.  represented  44,&quot;000 out of total foreign imports estimated at  516,000 in 1936 and  53,000 out of  1 million in 1937.    The bulk of the benefit of a reduction of duty would accordingly go to other countries and on 1937 figures it is estimated that, taking into account the possibility of evasion by price manipulation we might/lose  200,000 in revenue (in addition to the loss of  700,000 to  800,000 Which may be entailed by the concession already offered on softwood) for the sake of an American trade of total value  53,000.I recommend that this demand should be refused.
Plywood.The original American request was forconventionalisation of the 10$ duty on plywood faced with Douglas fir and this has been conceded.    The Americans later presented a new request for free entry for all softwood plywood.    This was rejected and they now ask for reduction to h%.    U.S.A. is the principal supplier, but softwood plywood is in direct  competition,  and is interchangeable, with birch and alder plywood.    We cannot therefore give a concession on one without extending it to all, because of our most-favoured-nation obligations.    Of the total of these three kinds of plywood .U.-3.- imports were in 1936,  231,000 oat of  3,444,000. The loss of revenue in reducing the duty from 10% to 5$ would thus be  172j000 to benefit a U.S.  total trade of  281;000, and the sacrifice of revenue would be twelve times the total amount of duty saved to II. S.  importers.I recommend that this.request should be rejected. Electric Jotore. The request is for a reduction of the duty from 20$ to 15$ on electric motors below 80 lbs. weight.    The American interest is mainly in small motors of the types used in domestic appliances.      While it would be administratively possible to differentiate between electric motors by reference to their weight,such differentiation would not, having regard to the wide range and types of electric motors,  satisfactorily distinguish the small motors of the kind in which the U.S. have a predominant Interest,    A concession not subject to a clear workable limit would be of greater benefit to othervacuum cleaners and refrigerators and the Americans should be content with these. The Delegation had understood that this poisition had been accepted by the Ameri cans.countries than to the U.3.A*We have already promisedconcessions on a wide range of electric appliances such as
Typewriters.    We have already offered substantial reductions in duty on standard typewriters which represent 75$ of the American trade ana on 3-bank portables.    The Americans are now pressing for a reduction on 4-Dank portables, which constitute the main class of portable machines, from.  2 to,  1.12 per machine. Until this year U.S.A. was the principal foreign supplier of .4-bank portables but recently there has been a large influx of cheap machines from Germany, and the United Kingdom industry has complained that at the same time the Americans have started a price cutting: campaign.    In the circumstances I should deprecate a further concession.    Here again the Delegation had understood that the Americans had accepted the position. Motor cars. We have offered conventionalisation of the 33:1$ duty on motor cars of 25 horse power and upwards and this offer covers, on our estimate,  about 70$ of the American trade.    The Americans are now pressing for an extension of the concession to all cars over 20 horse power.    The range from 20 to 25 horse power includes the German 24 horse power Opel car which is now being developed rapidly and is likely to invade the&apos;United Kingdom market in the near future.    The danger of tying our hands against an increase in the duty could however be reduced by limiting the conventionalisation to cars and complete chassis over a certain value, (provided that certain administrative difficulties, which are being examined as quickly as possible,  could &quot;be   overcome), since the competitive power of the German car rests mainly on its low. price.    On the other hand any undertaking not to increase the duty on motor cars will lead to protests from the United Kingdom industry, which has already applied to the I.D..A.C. for an all round increase;    and any undertaking covering all cars over 20 horse power,  even if qualified by a value limit would be hotly attacked.    Although, therefore, the present duty is a high one and the United Kingdom motor industry is in the position of supplying well over 90$ of the home market,    I feel disclined
to recommend any extension of the offer already made.Silk Stockings.    The request is for an undertaking, that the margin of preference will not &quot;be increased. &apos;We have already conceded what is in effect a substantial reduction of duty on most American silk stockings.    Though in fact it is not likely that the margin of preference will he increased the complicated nature of the silk duties makes it difficult to give the definite undertaking which the Americans ask for.&apos;  Apart from this I am reluctant to give any undertaking as to margins, of preference where a guarantee as to the rate of duty has been given,  since to do so introduces far too great a rigidity into our duty system. The attack upon Imperial Preference  can most effectively he -waged by restricting the freedom of different parts of the Empire to increase their concessions to one another and, in my view, we should do everytning possible to retain as much freedom in this matter as possible.    \7e have had to put up a great fight in connection with the Newfoundland part of the Agreement on this very point.      So far as the United Kingdom is concerned,  we have succeeded in avoiding undertakings as to margins of preference except in a few cases where, for revenue reasons,  we cannot guarantee maximum duties.    It is much to our interest to avoid setting e precedent in this matter,  which some Dominions would be only too ready to follow to the detriment of our trade.New American Concessions.    Telegram No.217 announces a small concession of 2j?% (from 42i$ to 409a) on woollen fabrics of certain types,  on which they have already offered 40$, if United Kingdom trade did not exceed a minimum quantity during the first twelve months of the agreement!    This is a welcome concession but Is not of much importance.
In addition,  since our last discussion^the Americans have made improved offers on cotton piece goods, some other woollen fabrics, wool wearing apparel and a few other items. While these make the picture a little better from our point of view they have not altered substantially the,balance of the agreement as described in my last memorandum.

COPY MO./C^CAB I NET.COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND AGRICULTURE.UNITED KINGDOM - UNITED STATES TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.Note by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The -Committee on Trade and Agriculture will wish to consider, at their Meeting to be held on October 13th, the attached telegram which has been received from His Majesty1s Ambassador in Washington.(Intld.) H.Foreign Office.October 11th, 1938.
From UNITED STATES OF &apos;AMERICA.Decypher.Sir R, Lindsay (Washington).8th October,  1938.D.12.41 a. in9th October, 1938.9.30 a.in9th October, 1938.No.  369.IMPORTANT.Trade Agreement.1.      We have at last reached the point where,  in words of your telegram No. 625, concessions demanded of us represent the absolute limit of American requests and would if granted lead immediately to signature.     The protracted negotiations which have led to this have brought me personally to that state of &quot;bitterness and exasperation which usually results from dealings with United States Government.      Their delays and tergiversations have been intolerable, they can see no point of view but their own and their demands cause His Majesty&apos;s Government loss of revenue and administrative difficulties out of all proportion to the benefits likely to accrue from American trade.     We are &quot;being put through the mangle of American politics.      Yet a full list of our grievances would not be more than I anticipated when I wrote my telegram No.  343.2.      We have not yet explored the possibilities hut I expect we shall be able to obtain little alleviation of the terms now offered and His Majesty&apos;s Government will be confronted with a erucial decision.3.      I myself have always advocated Trade Agreement less on economic than on political grounds.      Political grounds today are as.overwhelmingly strong as ever before.     Not wishing to over-state my case,  I have never said that even complete -surrender by
us would, secure whole-hearted friendship of United States Government and people hut it is certain, in case-of -fa-i-lure, that blame will he laid on us in American eyes and we shall alienate the sympathy we can ill afford to lose.     We should commit a first class political crime and our justification, even though it might.he a real one, would consist of a multi-tude of minor economic factors which could hardly he under-stood by any but experts and which would not be perceived at all by the public.4.     Mr. Hull&apos;s policy of lowering American tariffs by means of trade agreements has reached its climax in his present supreme effort to conclude a comprehensive treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government.     Failure of that effort will bring about a tremendous recession.     I admit that I have never &apos; thought that the policy would become a permanent feature of American political life.      Sectionalism and corruption of political ethics will always undermine it..      It has no deep roots.      It has continued and even flourished solely by virtue of Mr. Hull&apos;s personal prestige and respect he commands in Congress and throughout the country.      If he vanished from the scene, his policy would also vanish and that would be deplorable in itself.     But it would be disastrous if it were possible to say, as would be said both here and in England, that death blow to his policy was our failure to come to terms now with the United States.5.      Canadian aspect of the present situation must not be overlooked.     They have practically come to terms with the United States Government and Canadian Prime Minister is expected to1&quot; come here to sign.     Their treaty however is in important respects dependent on conclusion of ours and they have been pressing His Majesty&apos;s Government to hasten that conclusion even at the cost of great sacrifices.      If our treaty now fails
Canadians and Americans will &quot;be thrown back again into difficult negotiations.     Probably they would bring them to a successful conclusion but the new treaty would be a greatly diluted form of the present one and we should bear the odium of that both&apos; in the United States of America and in Canada.6.      On the actual merits of agreement, as it now stands in the American draft, I put forward my own opinion with diffidence owing to its technical nature and because factors of other than commercial nature come into consideration some of which are beyond my powers of appreciation.     But I am advised by my commercial staff that American concessions to us will be of very great value and even essential to our export trade and I believe from a purely commercial point of view that it would .in the last resort be worth our while to agree to it as it stands.     Value of agreement however is not to be measured in terms of goodwill nor are its disadvantages to toe valued in terms of departmental difficulties or disturbance of trade or even loss of revenue or protection.      Infinitely wider issues are at stake and I myself (though I should hope-to. obtain - some minor adjustments) am so impressed with their importance that I should prefer to accept the draft as it stands rather than toreak.      I cannot help thinking that His Majesty&apos;s Government will probably come to the same conclusion when the moment for irrevocable decision arrives and I would beg them to face this crux immediately.
