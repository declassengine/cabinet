(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)*SECRET.CABINET.PURCHASE OF ROUMANIAN WHEAT. Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign^Affairs.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the attached extract from the draft Conclusions of yesterday&apos;s Meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Trade and Agriculture.CP. 326 (38).(Intld.) H.Foreign Office.October 14th, 1938.
PROPOSED The Committee next considered the proposal of thePURCHASE OPROUMANIAN SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS that a quantity ofWHEAT.Roumanian wheat should he purchased by the Food (Defence*&quot; &apos;Plans) Department for food storage0THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he had had conversations on this subject with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade, The proposal was for the Food (Defence Plans) Department to turn over part of the wheat it had already bought for storage and to buy 800,000 tons of Roumanian wheat in place of it.     He understood that the proposal was both uneconomic and unbusinesslike, but nevertheless he felt that the political arguments in its favour deserved, serious consider-eration.      There was no question of our wanting to effect an economic encirclement of Germany or to block her expansion, but it was very important at the present time that we should riot appear disinterested in the Danubian countries,      The proposal was one of those considered by the Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Frederick Leith-RosSo      Unfortunately a decision must be taken at once since Herr Funk (the German Minister of Economics) was now on his tour in Eastern Europe and was due to arrive in Roumania next weeko     He (Lord Halifax) was anxious,  in the circumstances, to show this measure of interest in Roumania, and to show it before Herr Funk arrived.The Foreign Secretary went on to say that he recognised that it could be argued that the whole Danubian position was now well nigh hopeless and that,  in any case, a. purchase of 200,000 tons of wheat was not going to put it right.      On the other hand, there was force in the argument that at this time of international unsettlement it was desirable to make these Danubian countries less dependent economically
stillnn Germany^ and to let them feel that they could/turn to us, so that, when more settle! times arrived, we should not find our position there gone &quot;beyond recall,-,      This was a comparatively small matter but it might be the means of gaining timee      On the whole, he was not afraid that this would be regarded in Germany as an unfriendly gesture, since the Rouraan? ui wheat surplus was in the neighbourhood of 1,700,000 tons, of which half a million had already been earmarked for Germany;    if we took 800,000 tons, this still left a million tons available to Germany.      He understood the financial loss on the transaction would be in the neighbourhood, of  50,000 or  60,000, dependent on the price paid for the wheatc- THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that this appeared to be a purely political question^      Prom, the strictly Treasury point of view it was,  of course, objectionable, but if it was considered really necessary politically he would, not stand in the wayeTHE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that from his &quot; Department&apos;s point of view.also the proposal was quite indefensible, but he agreed with the Chancellor that if it was necessary politically it ought to be approved.     He considered, however,  that he (the President) ought to receive specific authority from the Cabinet befbre instruct-ing the Pood (Defence Plans) Department to take this uneconomic action.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that the matter would have to be settled before the meeting of the Cabinet on Wednesday., October 19th.      He had thought that the Committee might perhaps reach a decision and report its action to the Cabinet, and that the President of the Board of Trade might act on the Committee&apos;s d.ecision0      It might, however;. be desirable to consult the Prime Minister.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought that it was essential to know the Prime Minister&apos;s mind in this matter. It was conceivable that the Prime Minister might not think the proposal in line with the objects which he had pursued in his conversations in Germany.It was suggested that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should write to the Prime Minister, and that a decision could be postponed until the following Saturday, or possibly the following Monday.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER hoped that it would be made clear to the Prime Minister that from a business point of view the transaction was quite indefensible, since wheat of poor storing quality and higher price would replace &quot;better storing wheat which could be obtained at a lower price.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE mentioned that some weeks ago he had been asked to arrange a transaction of the same kind for Prance and that it might be a little embarrass-ing to explain why it could be done for Roumania and not for Prance.SIR FREDERICK LEITH-ROSS pointed out that, while the transaction might be bad business from the point of view of food storage, anything that we could do to encourage trade with the Danubian countries was welcome in the sense that it made it more possible for those countries to make payment on their considerable debts to us.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that, while lie was prepared if necessary to make this particular purchase for reasons of foreign policy, he was very unwilling that the Pood Department should come to be regarded as a collecting agency for the benefit of British creditors.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS undertook to lay the case fully before the Prime Minister.
Committee agreed:-(l) To take note.that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would submit the case fully to the Prime Minister in a letter to be despatched forthwith.(S) That, subject to the Prime Minister&apos;approval, and in anticipation of Cabinet authority, the President of tie  Board of Trade should be authorised to proceed with the purchase of 200,000 tons of Roumanian wheat in replacement of wheat already held in store by the Pood (Defence Plans) Department.(3) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should report the action taken to the Cabinet at their Meeting on Wednesday, October 19th..
