SECRET. CP.  254(38).COPY NO.    LfeJlCABINET. DEFENCE PREPARATIONS. FORECAST OF SUPPLY POSITION AND BASIS OF FUTURE POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues three papers drawn up at my request by the Service Departments.2.        My object in asking for the preparation of these papers was to obtain as clear a view as possible of the progress of our defence programmes on- the Service side, and I thought that this would best be done by relating the information to a single date.     I selected the 1st of August, 1939, as the date for various reasons, amongst which I may mention that it is at or about the date when the necessary preparations for war on the civil side ought, in my judgment, to be completed so far as organisation is concerned, and it is at or about the end of the third effective year of rearmament, that year being the year in which, as Mr. Winston Churchill has reminded us, we may expect to see real results from a munitions programmeo     1st August is, moreover, about the time of the year at which the possibility of an out-break of war is at its highest.^ -   \3. The papers deal mostly with supply, thoughreference is made also to personnel in the Admiralty and War Office papers.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.
99Qm L?In regard to the Air Ministry I understand this latter question will be dealt with fully in a com-prehensive paper which the Secretary of State for Air has under preparation dealing with all aspects of the Air Force problem, including its war potential.     These returns appear to me more valuable than previous returns of the kind, since the programmes are now sufficiently advanced for a reasonably firm forecast to be made up to 1st August, 1939c4. I should broadly summarise the position as on 1stAugust, 1939, as follows; NAVY..Broadly speaking, the Fleet then available for war will be substantially complete as regards armaments, stores and supplies, subject only to the exception that(i) the anti-aircraft rearmament of the Fleet will not be completed,,(ii)there will still be a substantial shortage of aircraft 0&quot;War capacity will be available to maintain theFleet on a war basis.REGULAR ARMY.The equipment of the Field Force will be virtually completed except in regard to armoured fighting vehicles, anti-aircraft artillery and chemical warfare Companies.     As regards medium and heavy artillery, the Field Force will still be equipped with existing armaments, which will be under replacement by more modern types. The scale of equipment and reserves is calculated on the basis of an Eastern theatre of war - a scale which is inadequate for the Continent.Capacity to meet war wastage will generally be availableo
Although this memorandum does not deal with personnel, I think I  should draw attention to the statement in paragraph 11 of the War Office paper as to the effect of the shortage of personnel in technical arms,AHTIrAIRCKAFT REQUIREMENTS.The position next August will be wholly-different from what it is to-day.     Whereas now we have only a fraction of what we require, in August next the approved requirements for the Air Defence of Great Britain will be either complete or approaching completion as regards major items0 Where gaps will still exist in regard to some natures of guns these gaps will, I am advised, be closed under the scheme of production now in operation by about the middle of 1940.The position at ports abroad (which rank after the Air Defence of Great Britain in order of -priority) will be less satisfactory, but even here the position will have been substantially improved at the more important fortresses. THE TERRITORIAL ARMY (other than the A.A. Divisions) will not have its approved minimum scale of equipment, which is on a training basis only, fully completed and this scale of equipment is, of course, quite inadequate for war purposes. ROYAL AIR FORCE.The position is best seen by a comparison of the monthly output figures for the last six months (which average just over 200 air frames a month) with the forecast now given by the Air Ministry for the period up to August next. These latter figures are understood to be a drastic discounting of
forecasts&apos; given by the firms concerned, but assume a steady flow of additional labour at the rate of about 6% a month and sub-contracting to an overall average extent of 35%.      There is now a reformed supply organisation in the Air Ministry and much improved central arrangements in the industry, closely linked with the Air Ministry through Sir Charles Bruce Gardner0 5. The above summary is given on the very broad lines., andit must further be remembered that no branch of the fighting forces can ever be completely ready for war, o?^ing to constant change in requirements, etc06. The papers raise, I think,  two major questions.,The first of these is whether recent events call for any revision of the scope of the authorised programmes of the three Services.      In that connection I may perhaps remind my colleagues that the financial implications even of the-present j^ogramme s:?e so grave that it has been a question whether they do not threaten that stability which is after all on experience probably our strongest weapon of war.      The problem is too large to include a treatment of it in the present papers  and I shall do no more than indicate,  as a broad and provisional judgment, that no material change is requisite as regards the Navy, that any material expansion as regards the Air Force would come up against extremely difficult questions of provision of personnel and especially trained air personnel and technical personnel, and that only in regard to the Army may there be some ground for looking again at the programmes.      I have in mind the position in regard to .
the Territorial Arrayo     As is pointed out in the paper submitted by the War Office, the present scale of equipment would not enable the Territorial Army to train effectively on embodiment;    (still less would, it provide training equipment for any additional forces which it might be decided to raise on the outbreak of war) It is also estimated, that no fully equipped Territorial formations could take the field until 8 months after the outbreak of war0     In my judgment we must be prepared to consider some increase in the scale of equipment at present authorised for the Territorial Array.I understand that, if some increase in the scale of equipment of the Territorial Army was now authorised, the resulting orders could be placed, under the existing system, for early production;    and that the effect of placing such orders at an early date would be to increase the volume of production in the period up to the 1st August,.1939o7. The second major question is whether there is,on    merits and not on politics, any ground for immediately altering our central supply organisation by the establishment of a Ministry of Supplyo8,        .There is a strong feeling in favour of the creation of such a Ministry, freely expressed in the newspapers and likely to be freely expressed when Parliament meetse     The case advanced for this action may be summarised as follows:-
Our position is so seri.ous as to require forthwith what Lord Baldwin is understood to haye termed the mobilisation of industry,     Only by repeating the policy embodied in the Ministry of Munitions in the last war can the needs of the situation be mete     What is requisite is a wide expansion of our existing rearmament plans and the utmost speed in carrying therri 6ut0     This can only be secured by making all suitable industrial and labour capacity available to the extent required for armament0     General industry and export industry must, therefore, be content with wha;&quot;: may be found to be left for them when the first need has been metc     This implies compulsion on industry (it is not clear whether compulsion on labour is also contemplated),     For compulsory powers legislation is required     The powers should not be given to a Service Minister, much less to three Service Ministers,,     They must, if given., be entrusted to a civilian Minister with a department specially&apos;staffed to exercise them with speed and efficiency - a Minister and Ministry of SuppLya9, As against this view, it may be pointed out that themain need which produced the Ministry of Munitions was the need of munitions for a huge land armyD     It has so far been accepted policy that we shall not again have recourse to such an army. On present policy our army requirements, properly so called, are strictly limited.     Making full allowance for the requirements of the other Services and fOr anti-aircraft requirements we should not need for our programme more than a moderate propor-tion of the output of the appropriate industryo     It is quite impracticable to set out with the precision requisite in a statute where we shall require to have the power of compulsion. The power taken must, therefore5 be a general power, to be
Q 9 Q&amp; cj ciexercised as called for where the necessary production- cannot &quot;be obtained By agreement     There arc obvious diff ictilties.: xn getting through Parliament in peace time a provision framed in such wide terms,,     Even if the power were obtained.,it would be most difficult to administer, and the cost would be likely to he very highs.10.       A single illustration may serve to illustrate the sort of points which would arise,,     One of the serious problems is shortage of labour for instrument work needing long training. The only immediate remedy would he to draw on the tool room staffs of the great engineering concerns.     But in these days that staff is the cog on which the working of these concerns turns, and if that staff is withdrawn or seriously weakened, claims would arise which it would be almost impossible to assess.     On a wider plane, the need which would probably be found to exist to use parts only of integrated engineering plants would introduce great confusion in industry.11.       This illustration gives occasion for the reflection that if the most serious deficiencies forecasted are analysed, the real bottle-necks consist of certain highly specialised products, e.g., fire control gear, gun mountings, predictors and the like.     It is a matter of considerable doubt whether general compulsory powers over1 the engineering industry would be of much use in helping a solution of these problems.12.       It is also well to remember that so far we have had the willing co-operation of industry in carrying out the programme, and that this co-operation has been given during years of general prosperity in industry a.     There is no reason to suppose that this co-operation will not continue to be given In any measures of further acceleration which we may decide to adopt, more especially as other claims on indxistry show a tendency to decrease.
fd eJ &apos; 13,.       Further,  if our first need is speed in provision, then we are faced with the fact that a change over from the existing supply organisation will in itself cau-se serious delay while the new organisation gets into its stride.    And as to the probability of quick results from new capacity to he provided &quot;by the new organisation, we may usefully remind ourselves that shell provided by the Ministry of Munitions began to reach the armies about a year and a half after the Ministry was set up.    It may well be, therefore, that within the framework so far set for our rearmament we shall get quicker and better results by continuing to rely on the existing supply departments, which have been reorganised for the purpose.    This has been done in the Air Ministry quite recently.14.       I have thought it might be useful to set out some, at all events, of the considerations which arise in regard to a Ministry of Supply.    I may perhaps add, for the sake of clearness, that I should myself in &quot;no case contemplate bringing the Admiralty into it or including in its sphere any supplies, other than those where the problem would be to switch over to e. g.. aircraft or munitions production, plants not normally engaged in such production.15.       I propose to confer forthwith with my Service Colleagues as to the suggestions for acceleration made in the three Papers appended to this Memorandum.(Intld. ) T.W.H.I.richmond Terrace, S.W.1,, 21st October,  1938.
BT SECRET.ACCELERATION OF PRODUCTION. STATEMENT PREPARED BY ADMIRALTY..At its Meeting on the 7th October, 1938, the Committee of Imperial Defence decided to invite the Service Departments to furnish the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, by the 18th October, 1958, with statements on the lines indicated in the Appendix to their Minutes (Paper 19/10/103).The &quot;statement to be prepared by the admiralty&apos; is reproduced as Appendix A of this Report. The answers to the questions set out therein are given hereunder.PART I.lo What will be the number of ships in each of theimportant classes completed and available by the 1st August 1939?In addition to existing ships of all categories,, none of which it is in contemplation to scrap before that date, there will be completed and available for service by the 1st August 1959 the following ships of the more important classes:-Aircraft Carrier ........    1Cruisers.................    4Tribal Class and destroyers o ...........20Submarines. *............* HEscort Vessels...........    8Submarine Depot Ship.. . ...    1In addition, two capital ships will complete, their modernisation in September/October, 1939.2, What part of the Programme of Anti-AIrcraft Re-armament of the. Fleet will be completed by the 1st August, 1959?
A/A rearmament of the Fleet will, it is anticipated,he completed to the. 1st August 1939 to the following extent:-9 capital ships ......leaving 2 to he completedlater..1 aircraft carrier.... leaving 1 to be completed later,10 8-inch cruisers.... leaving 5 to be completed later.6 6-inch cruisers..... leaving 5 (Delayed due to priority being given to Rearmament Glass II).5 A/A cruisers........leaving 11 to be completed later.7 A/A Destroyers...... leaving 29 to be completed later.( Escort Vessels ).( 5   .39      ( Patrol Vessels ).....leaving 8 to be completed later.( Minesweepers      )3, 7/hat will be the position regardih,   war reserves ofammunition, stores and. equipment, and war capacity, by the 1st August,1939, and to what extent will this be adequate to maintain under war conditions the Fleet available for active service on the 1st August 1939?The.position as to war reserves is expected to be as follows:-(a)    Armament Stores:-Full reserves on the authorised scales are expected to be available.in all the main categories except Bombs, Pyrotechnics and Torpedo Components for Aircraft, of which the prospective shortages are 37$, 50$ and 66$ respeetively,A deficiency of 20$ may also arise on mines for Surface Layers and Loop Mines..
O *3 r1(b) Victualling and Clothing Stores.Reserves should be adequate for the Fleet in the event of war, except for small deficiencies in uniform clothing for pensioners and reservists, and a more material deficiency in decontamination clothing for naval barracks and shore establishments.(c) Naval Stores.Broadly speaking, reserves on the 1st August 1939 should be sufficient to last H. M.   Ships for a pei*lod of three months on a war-time basis.(A)   Fuel.By 1st August 1939 reserves will be very near the approved 12 months&apos; reserve on the basis of estimated war expenditure.      Roughly half this quantity is already available at home ports and the other half will be available at overseas ports.(e)   Aircraft:Allowing for the authorised scales of Immediate and War Reserves and the need for provision for making good wastage on a peace-time basis,- it is estimated that there will he a net deficiency on 1st August 1939 of 511 aircraft, which.may be increased by about 20$ by the - exclusion of certain aircraft whose availability is in question.(4) To what extent will the Programme of Works toprovide War capacity be completed by 1st August, 1939?By August, 1939,  it is considered that, apart from about eight items, oapacity will be available to meet war
9 9 Q 6 d 6requirements, all necessary plant having been provided and. allocations made.      The Admiralty have been working to complete work in this respect by the end of 1939 and,  for some 6*f the outstanding items? financial&apos; outlay will probably be required;    reference to the Treasury will be made latex&apos;,  as necessary.      It is hoped to be able to get increased capacity for war production through the Engineering Employers&apos;  Federation which embraces the great majority of the producing engineering firms in the country.Certain major extensions to works,  such as that at Vickers&apos; works at Crayford. for fire control instruments and those at the armour making firms will be complete and in operation by the given date.      The Mine Filling De&apos;pot at Milford Haven will be available in December 1939, and a big-Admiralty gauge factory at Sheffield is completing.There are certain Admiralty major works items such as the underground storage of oil fuel and explosives which, whatever is done,  cannot be finished next year,  and will run on into 1940, 1941 and even 1942.      Steps are being taken to ascertain whether,  if extra expense is incurred, contractors can achieve any reasonable acceleration,0    the chances look promising in more than one case.PART II,What steps can be taken to improve the above position by 1st August, 1939,  or shortly thereafter, and what would these steps involve.Acceleration of certain &quot;works items, as mentioned in reply to question 4,  can be achieved by the expenditure of additional money on them.      There are also other works,  such as provision of underground shelters for personnel at certain ports, notably Chatham, which could be undertaken.
A greater use of the Engineering Employers f Federation should also assist in the rapid execution of orders;    one of their most useful functions is to see that sub-contractors do not overstock their books.Assuming that acceleration of production and supply overrides all other considerations, it is thought that, if there were greater freedom to place direct contracts, instead of preparing specifications and going out. to tender, much time would be saved.      As far.as the Admiralty is concerned,  there is still apt to he too much office procedure which undoubtedly d.elays the placing of orders, etc.      Valuable as the Treasury Inter Service Committee has been, the experience of the recent crisis showed, how things can be speeded up, when the taking up of ships, acceleration of orders, the hiring of railway trucks, etc. f etc. , were carried through at top spe.ed,  the Treasury being informed afterwards or concurrently.      It is felt that deviation from normal routine methods must continue if the maximum effort is to be achieved in the next twelve months.
PERSONNEL.(a) Fleet Services (other than Fleet Air Arm)oOn the assumption that the phrase &quot;to maintain under war conditions&quot; in Question 3 of Part I may he interpreted, so far as personnel is concerned,  as meaning a state in which the Fleet is mobilised and the Naval Reserves are called up,, the resources available should be adequate to man the Fleet envisaged in Question 1 on the 1st August, 1939 - except to the extent that deficiencies may be expected in the following categories(i). 5,000 Able Seamen in Reserves(ii) Reserve V/S Ratings )    Shortageconsiderable;,(iii) Active Servico and Reserve W/T Ratings(iv) Active Service and Reserve Electrical Artificers(v) Active Service and Reserve Ordnance Artificers(vi) Reserve Writer and Supply     )       MinorRatings )       deficiencya(vii) Senior Reserve Stoker-Ratings,(b) Fleet Air Arm,,,There is a prospective shortage as at 1st August 1939 of:-C a t apul t S b. ip sCarriers and ReserveScShorBaseso____Pilots o o 0. o 73 A ***a 304Observers ao 49 coo-, 254Air Gunnerso 7 oaav 269(/ Can be -made up by R,AoF0 personnel)0

SECRET.Statement prepared for the information of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.Anticipated position on 1st August, 1939.PART I. FIELD PORCE.1* The Regular Contingent of the Field Force, as at presentenvisaged, comprises:(a) The Army units of the Advanced Air Striking Force. . (b) G.H.Q. and G.H.Q.  troops, (cj Two Corps Headquarters and Corps Troops.(d) Lines of Communication Troops.,(e) Four Infantry Divisions.,(f) One Mobile Division.2. In addition - to.the Field. Force and its reserves, the equipment requirements of the following must also be provided for:-(a) All overseas garrisons, particularly Egypt,Palestine and the Sudan.      These must be as completely equipped as possible prior to the 1st August, 1939, including sufficient reserves to make them self-contained, so that no call will be made for these garrisons oh Field Force re serve So(b) Regular troops at home (other than the Field Force),essential training units, schools and technical establishments and the necessary maintenance reserves.(c) The miniuum training requirements of the Territorialt Army, (other than the Air Defence of Great Britain,and Coast Defence units).(d) The requirements of Dominions, and other, i.e.,foreign repayment customers, particularly Egypt and Iraqc.3. The equipment of the Field Force cannot therefore beconsidered apart from the above requirements, and the forecast
given below of the equipment situation on 1st August is therefore based on these total requirementsc40 The Forecast is also based on the scale of equipment and reserves of all natures for&apos;the Field Force at present authorised, he., for a campaign in an Eastern theatre of war.     This scale is inadequate for a campaign on the Continent,It is also assumed in the forecast that the situation in Palestine will have been restored to che normal by 1st August, 1939, and all reinforcements returned to the United Kingdom.,5o The Mobile Division, on its present organization?comprises two mechanized cavalry brigades, one tank brigade, the the necessary divisional troops, including two motor battalions and two regiments, RoHoAoOf these, allowing for the Tank Battalion recently sent to Egypt, equipment will only be available by 1st August, 1939, for the following;One mechanized cavalry brigadeoTwo motor battalionscTwo regiments, R.H.A., equipped with 18/25 pdrs^ The equipping of the above units, including the essential war reserves, would involve taking nearly all the modern armoured fighting vehicles from the remaining mechanized cavalry and Royal Tank Corps units at home, and from training units and schools, but against this it may be assumed that after 1st August, 1959, modern tank-and other essential equipment will be forthcoming from new production in considerable quantities.6. The Field Force, as given in paragraph 1 above,includes four mechanized divisional cavalry regiments and three army  tank battalionso
By 1st August, 1939, there will he sufficient-equipment for only one array takk battalion, and the equipment&quot; situation in the divisional cavalry regiments will not permit of any of these being fit for service by that dateo7. The Field Force also jjrieludes four- chemical warfarecompanies, but sufficient equipment will not be available by 1st August, 1939, to allow of any of these units&quot;being ready for serviceo8. For remainder of the Field Force,, and for therequirements in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the situation regarding the major items of equipment on 1st August, 1939, will be as stated below:(a) S SS.-,-S4P7,SuThe Field Force will be complete, but there will be a shortage of some 4,000 guns for the additional requirements0(D) Anti-Tank Rifles0The weapons will be complete, but the war reserves of ammunition will not be complete0(.c)  2&quot; MortarscThe weapons will be complete, but sufficient ammunition will not be available for the full scale of equipment-of more than five battalions of the forty-one, in the Field Force, leaving nothing for&apos; other re qui r ement s(d) 3&quot; MortarThe weapons will be complete and. also the ammunition for the Field Force and garrisons abroado(e) Bren carriersoThe Field Force will be complete? but the remaining requirements will be only partially met.

War capacity.Capacity/to vi.eet  the war wastage of the force included in paragraph 1 would, broadly speaking, be available, though pending completion of the explosives,&apos;  . chemical and filling factories mentioned below, there would be a considerable dependence upon Woolwich (filling) Waltharn and Billingham.      No provision has so far been made for the war requirements of the Territorial Army, India, Dominions, Egypt, &amp;o.lie In addition,  it cannot be too strongly emphasizedthat in considering the roadinoss for war of the Field Force,  equipment cannot be divorced from personnel.On the present basis of establishments and recruit-ing it will be completely impracticable by 1st August,  1939, for more than approximately 50% of the Field Force to take the field immediately owing to the shortage of personnel alone in the technical arms.

In   the above calculations only the minimum equipment essential for the peace-time training of the Territorial Army, other than the Air Defence of Great Britain-and Coast Defence units, has been allowed for, and this minimum scale will not be fully available owing to the prior&quot; claims of the Field Force and overseas garrisons.On the embodiment of the Territorial Army,  it would be essential to increase these minimum requirements, and this would constitute an additional commitment.
w ci u2.        In effect, this equipment situation moans that not&apos; only would the Territorial $rww &quot;be unable to train effectively on embodiment, but that no fully eouipped formations could take the field until about Z 4- 8 months at tho earliest, he,, when the essential equipment could be made available by post-mobilization production.3. As regards this latter point, authority for equipment for the Territorial Army is at present restricted to  Training equipment on a limited scale; and it is not permitted to create extra capacity for the purpose,.      On 1.8.59 therefore equipment would not be complete and there would be no, war rescrves and generally &quot;no capacity for war maintenance,NEV7 FACTORIES.The main factories completed and in production by 1st August,  1939, would be Fo.c;ooryNottinghamHerefordChorleyIrvineArdeerBlackburn e .PembreyIvlossendHuddorsfield c0Kemet (1st portion)..Pro due t...Guns and Carriages.FillingFillingT.N.T.CorditeMechanical FuzesT.N.T.AmmoniaAm ionium Nitrate Gas

PART II. ACCELERATION MEASURES,As. far as possible within the limits of existing powers and of the supply of skilled labour at present obtainable at the factories, all possible acceleration has already been arranged on anti-aircraft and other urgent equipments,,    In a few instances, some further acceleration would be possible at substantially heavier costc,Further substantial acceleration would therefore depend on the provision of additional skilled labour and the taking of-powers to permit of rearmament work in private factories being given effective priority over Industrial and foreign ordersc      To achieve anjr material improvement by 1st August, 1939, these steps would have to be taken forthwith,Certain improvements in deliveries during 1939 could be achieved without special powers if additional orders were available, and the firms were assured of a comparatively long term programme.     Apart from the moral effect on firms and.   ;&apos; labour at present working on limited orders, a number of firms (e0g0, on 25 pdr, shell &amp;c)    will in fact complete their orders early in 1939,      On the present approved programme, there is no further work to give them and it would appear at least logical to use this idle capacity to provide some war equipment *and reserves for the T.A.s-.^   1* is unnecessary to stress the effect of having idle capacity at a time when maximum acceleration is called for,vOctober,  19380

AIR MINISTRY STATEMENT.SECRETFORECAST OF FIRST-LINE STRENGTH OR &quot;METROPOLITAN AIR FORCpN 1.8.59.1.An outline forecast of the strength on 1.8.59 isgiven at Appendix I.2.These figures are given purelyfrom a material pointof view.They do not indicate the number of squadronswhich could be operated on the outbreak of war, or the period for which they could be maintained.     The balance between war wastage and the production of aircraft and training of personnel has not been drawn.     This balance Is now being considered fox1 inclusion in the paper for submission by the Secretary of State to the Committee of Imperial Defence.     It will suffice here to indicate that the number of squadrons which can be maintained with aircraft will necessarily decrease very considerably.5. The estimated rates of production In July 1939 are:aircraft (complete) 734.     With a continuance of peace it is estimated that production will reach its peak in January 1940 with a monthly output of 777.     If war breaks out in August 1959 it is estimated that a full use of the capacity available should result in an increase to a peak figure of 1900 a month by July 1940,     This makes no allowance for delays due to enemy action or air raid warnings.4. Reserves of ammunition (including bombs), petrol,stores and equipment, should be adequate for six months for the force which could be operated, though special steps may be necessary as regains Vicker &quot;E&quot; guns, and hydrogen
cylinders, and certain materials0     As regards the balloon barrage the balloons available for the London Area will be 500 as against a first-line requirement; of 4-50 * 20^ immediate resex^ve;    for the provincial barrage there will be 720 against a first-line requirement of 1008 4- 20^ immediate reserve.     No further reserve will exist by 1.8.39.5. Detailed report on the progress of works toprovide v/ar capacity is being completed.     This will show steps that have been taken and further steps envisaged.      It must, however, be emphasised that no such further steps can materially improve the situation before 1.8.39;    their effect will be to increase capacity and output after&apos; that elate.
