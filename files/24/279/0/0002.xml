(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). SECRET. / /OjTHE PRIME MINISTER&apos;S VISIT TO GERMANY. &apos;NOTES BY SIR HORACE WILSON CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET BY DIRECT!0T&quot;ffF&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER. &apos;Notes by Sir HoraceWilson,I travelled to Munich this morning by car with Von Dircksen, the German Ambassador in London, in two hours. He had not seen the Fuehrer after yesterday conversation between the Prime Minister and Hitler., but he had seen Von Ribbentrop, Weizsacker, Hewel and others who had been present at a conference with Hitler after we had gone.     Von Dircksen told me that the opinion of all of them was that Hitler had obviously been impressed by the Prime Minister and had felt that he?  the Prime Minister,  understood Hitler and that,z in turn, Hitler had appreciated the Prime Minister - especially the directness with which he had talked and the rapidity with which he had grasped the essentials of the situation.      Von Dircksen said that he himself was satisfied that the visit had been most valuable.      He added that it could not have been better timed or done in a better way*      They all seem to be. impressed by the &quot;statesmanship&quot; of what they evidently regard as a bold master-stroke in diplomacy-      It had clearly appealed to Hitler as something after his own heart,  and his subsequent long conversation with the Prime Minister hadCP.   202 (58),CABINS T.done nothing to lessen its effect.
I told Von Dircksen that although we should go into action as soon as we got home (e. g. the Prime Minister would see some of his more important colleagues this evening and also Lord Rune iman, arho had been asked to come back for the purpose) there were a good many things to be done -r in England, in Paris, and at Prague- and that inevitably this must take a few days.    It was essential that nothing should happen to interfere with what we were doing.      I said the Prime Minister had asked Lord Runciman last night, when announcing his visit to London, to urge both parties in Czechoslovakia to take no action that would lead to incidents pending the conversations.     We would do all we could to re-info rce this.      The German Chancellor had given the Prime Minister to understand that he,  for his part, would do what he could.      (The Prime Minister had in the meantime given Von Ribbentrop for delivery to Hitler the letter - copy attached - hinting that we ^expected him to help).    I pointed out to Von Dircksen that English opinion - impressed by the Prime Minister&apos;s action in going to Germany - would universally condemn any movement by Germany that cut across the next stage, and I urged him to use his influence to see that nothing of the kind happened.     He agreed to do so, adding that he did not think Hitler would want so to act. &quot;Hitler feels he is in serious conversation with the Prime Minister&quot;.-2-
I introduced Goering&apos;s name at this point as Ihad told Henderson to get into touch at once with Goeringiand use the same language to him.     Von Dirksen said that Goering - who has been really ill but is recovering and able to do some work - was a moderating influence.1 Von Dirksen then turned to the question how to apply self-determination.     He seemed to take it for granted that self-determination was the only way out and gave me the impression that Hitler had given instructions for ways and means to be worked out.      The German Foreign Office, he said, had been considering questions such as the local government areas to be taken for voting purposes, what to do about boundaries, who should vote, etco      The fact that the&apos;- German delegation yesterday (a very large one completely out-numbering our modest four) included Gaus,  their legal adviser,  who has been busily engaged on this matter, seems to suggest that they thought the discussions might get down to such practical matters&apos;Von Dirksen said he recognised that many questions would have to be considered, and that    th:r would take time      He agreed that the right conditions must exist locally, both for the preparation of a scheme and for the taking of the plebiscite.      He thought that unless the tension relaxed very considerably as a result of the decision in principle (it interested me to note how far the impression had gone that all that mattered was the Prime Minister&apos;s personal intimation to the world at large that that was the way out.&apos; ) it would be necessary to
During a halt in the journey to Munich I had a short conversation this morning with        Weizsacker, who had talked very freely to me throughout the visit.    He had an hour with the Fuehrer after yesterday&apos;s conversation.    He said the Prime Minister had made just the right impressnon on Hitler and that the -convers-ation..wit-h- &quot;the-JPrime Minister, had been most satisfactory.    (Before it took place he said to me &quot;This visit must succeed&quot; and no pencil point, least of all the one with which I now write, would stand the strain necessary to reproduce the emphasis he laid on the word &quot;must&quot;).    I spoke to WeizMcker on the linesof my talk with Von Dircksen as to the need to see that neither Hitler nor anybody else did anything to upset the Prime Minister1s further efforts.     He acknowledged the importance of this.    I got the impression that he was not afraid of it happening.    He, of course,  realised,   as everyone must, that an outbreak in Czechoslovakia might be too much for Hitler, but he assured me that the Prime Minister had made such an impression upon the Chancellor that the latter would hesitate.consider an international police force in the Sudeten German areas to replace the Czech State Police.      (The latter* he said, after enquiry of a German Foreign Office official, numbered 30,000 or more.)     As regards the attitude of France, Von Dirksen said he did not think they could oppose the principle of self-determination.     When I suggested that we might have a little trouble with the French, who would in any case take care to &quot;blame us, he said it could not be helped and that &quot;anyhow, the decision rested in that car&quot;, pointing to the Prime Minister&apos;s car just in front of us.
Hewel    (Von Ribbentrop&apos;s personal secretary), who seems to spend a good deal of his time at Berchtesgaden and to have ready access to Hitler, spoke to me this morning of his impressions of a conversation he had with Hitler last nighto      He confirmed what the others had said,  adding &quot;Hitler told me he felt he was speaking to a man&quot;,,       He added, what I had heard from  Weizsacker and Von Ribbentrop, that when Hitler received the Prime Minister&apos;s message on Wednesday morning his first remark was &quot;Oh, I can&apos;t let him come all this way;    I will fly to meet him in England&quot;, and it was a matter of regret to him to have to abandon the idea.Schmidt, the interpreter, who is probably a good judge of Hitler, said &quot;What impressed Hitler most was Mr. chamberlain&apos;s directness and clarity of thought and speech;    he likes that,&quot;At the luncheon at Munich today I sat next to Von Ribbentrop.      It is perhaps characteristic of him that neither to me nor (as I afterwards ascertained) to the Prime Minister throughout a two-hours&apos;  ride did he say anything about the favourable view Hitler had formed of the Prime Minister and of -the conversation.    I took up with him the question of giving the Prime Minister a fair chance to tackle the rest of his job.      He was not in his best mood, so I told him that while very many Englishmen knew little about Czechoslovakia they knew a good deal about the Prime Minister and would be united in resenting it if anything were done by Germany between the two conversations to wreck the Prime Minister&apos;s chances.      He made the
usual remark about incidents in Czechoslovakia.      This enabled me to refer to the story given to us at Berchtes-gaden (after the Prime Minister had gone in with Hitler for their private conversation) about 300 Germans having been Mlled at Eger the previous evenings      I told Von Ribbentrop that as soon as I heard this (before 6 p.m.) I had asked his private secretary to telephone to Berlin for a Statement of the facts.      Up to the time we left (8.15 p.m,) I had been given no reply, though I had several times asked for it.     When we returned to the hotel we had telephoned to the Runciman Mission for the truth.      Their answer was &quot;Nonsense.    There were no casualties yesterday. Since we have been here there have been only 28 casualties -including Germans and Czechs&quot;.      Von Ribbentrop made no comment on this.      Whereupon I said it would be well if everybody concerned woul^d remember that it is a good rule to have the facts before deciding action.In view of Von Ribbentrop&apos;s attitude and of other -remarks that he made, I impressed upon Sir N. Henderson the importance of getting in touch with Goering as soon as he could possibly manage to do so.(Intld. ) H.&apos; J.W.16th September, 1938.Somewhere above Germany.
APPENDIX.Grand Hotel, , . Berchtesgaden.16th September, 1938.My dear Chancellor,I am just on the point of leaving for London and shall ask Herr von Ribbentrop to be good enough to bring this message to you.      I have arranged to consult my colleagues as soon as I can on my return and shall report to them our conversation.      I hope also to be able to persuade Lord Runciman to return to London for a short time to give us his views.In the meantime I have asked Lord Runciman to appeal to both sides in Czechoslovakia to refrain from any action which would be likely to lead to further incidents pending the resumption of the conversations between Your Excellency and myself.      I feel sure that you will appreciate the importance of this and that you will be willing to use your influence in the same direction.Meanwhile I should like to express my pleasure at having established personal contact with- your Excellency and to thank you for your courtesy during my brief stay at Berchtesgaden.Yours faithfully,(Signed) NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.Den Fuehrer und Reichskanzler, Berchtesgaden*
