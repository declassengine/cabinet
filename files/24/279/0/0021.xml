THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. --- m -,-SECRET: COPY MO.   %$ $CABINETCP. 221/38)HOUSING SUBSIDIES:    SCOTLAND. Memo, by the Secretary of State for Scotland.1.     The rates of housing subsidies payable&amp;le to Scottish local authorities for slum clearance and decrowding operations prior to 1st April, 1938, were continued fcr a further period from that date by the Housing (Scotland) Acts (Continuance of Contributions) Order, 1938.     My predecessor explained in the House of Commons, with the concurrence of the Chancellor t*f the Exchequer, that while for technical reasons the order then made had to re-late t* a period of three years, it was the Government&apos;s intention to continue discussions that were then taking place with local authorities;    and it was implied, though not expressly stated, that if as a result of those discussions any alteration in the rates of subsidy were found to be necessary, provision wculi be made for the alteration t^ take effect from 1st January,  1939.2,     Discussiens -with the local authorities have continued since then and general agreement has been reached with them that the two separate subsidies under the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1930, and the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1935, relating to slum clearance and decrowding respectively should be consolidated into one subsidy for those two purposes.     (The corresponding subsidies in England and Wales were consolidated by the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1938) .3.     Building costs have risen appreciably and in view of the urgency and magnitude of the Scottish housing problem, I propose that there should be a certain4increase in the average rates of subsidy.     On a programme of 20,000 houses a year it is estimated that the additional cost to the Exchequer will be jf the average /
average order of  20,000 in respect of each year of the next subsidy period, which will last until 30th September, 194-2*   Hie additional cost will remain, a charge on the Exchequer for 40 years, the period over which housing subsidies are spread.   There will be no increase in commitments for the current financial year.I am convinced that this additional expenditure is necessary to enable the attack on Scotland&apos;s deplorable housing conditions to be maintained-   For some time local authorities have strongly represented that the subsidy under the- 1935 Act, which was based on building costs about 30 per cents less than present costs, is wholly inadequate and it was with some difficulty that they were persuaded to accept the proposal to postpone consideration in the beginning -of this year.A Special Sub-Committee appointed by the Associations of Local Authorities to consult with my Department have stated that they would he prepared to recommend their respective Associations to accept the above rates as reasonable in the present financial circumstances of the National Exchequers4-.   The proposed consolidation of subsidies will involve a conse-quential increase in the maximum grant payable to local authorities under the Act of 1935 for houses built in redevelopment areas where the necessary provision is costly.I should also propose to make provision for the normal rate of subsidy being increased where local authorities require to build blocks of flats on expensive central sites.The cost to the Exchequer of the increased redevelopment subsidy and of the special subsidy for expensive central sites will depend on the use that local authorities make of those provisions.   It is however improbable, espedially as the procedure in connection with the redevelopment of central sites is lengthy, that the cost to the Exchequer for proposals maturing within the whole of the next subsidy period will exceed  15,000 which would remain a charge on the Exchequer for 40 years i
5.     I propose also to make arrangements under which the Scottish Special Areas Housing Association will be authorised to build 20,000 houses after March 1939 in the Special Areas under the same general procedure as they are operating at present.     For this purpose the Association will be reconstructed.     In addition, I propose that either the reconstructed Association or one of the existing Scottish National Housing Companies should carry out a number of demonstration schemes by alternative methods of construction -in. selected districts outside the Special Areas with a view to stimulating local authorities to attack the grave Scottish housing problem in new ways.     There are certain details of these proposals still tg fee discussed and it is not yet certain whether legislation will be required or not for this purpose.     If it is found that legislation is necessary, it is my intention to make pro-vision for it in this Bill.6.     I have been in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in regard to iny proposals and have obtained his agreement to the terms of this Memorandum.     I should fee glad to have authority to prepare and submit to the Home Affairs Committee the necessary Bill, which must bo passed before the Christmas recess;J.C.OTTXSH OFFICE.19th October, 1938.
