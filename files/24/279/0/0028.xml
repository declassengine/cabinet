Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1938.SECRET. copy ftp.CP, 228 (38).CABINET.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a Note -which has been drawn up in India giving an estimate of the attitude which the Ministries in the seven provinces controlled by the Congress would have assumed in the event of war.Z.October 17, 1938.PROBABLE  ATTITUDE  OF   CONGRESS  PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS  IN THE EVENT  OF   WAR.SINCE the attitude of Congress Ministries would be dictated by the High Command, the deliberations of the Working Coirihiittee and All-India Congress Committee which happened to be sitting in Delhi during the period of the greatest tension in Europe--are of importance. From the public discussions, and decisions of the All India Congress Committee little is to be gleaned. The draft resolution laid before the All India Congress Committee by. the. Working Committee merely said that &quot; in the event of war breaking out in Europe, the All India Congress Committee delegates its powers to the Working Committee to deal with the situation as it arises from time to time.&quot; This was moved in the All India Congress Committee on the 25th September. l93S. by Vallabhai Patel. Masani (left wing) wanted to move amendments; consideration of the resolution was at once postponed in order to avoid discussion; negotiations were started with the left wing, and as a result the words &apos;&apos; in the light of the Haripura resolution on foreign policy and war danger &quot; were added, and the resolution as so amplified was moved by the Congress President on the 26th September, and at once carried unanimously without speeches or comments.The gist Of the Haripura resolution of February 1938 was as fdllows : India desires peace oh the basis of internatidnaleo-pperation arid goodwill, and stands for disarmament and collective security. World CO-operation is impossible so long as Imperialisin holds sway. Therefore Imperialism and exploitatidn of one people by another must end. , In. recent years Fascist aggression has. increased,, and has been supported by British foreign policy, in Germany, Spain and the Far East, which is helping in the drift to Imperialist world war. India will be no party to stich a war, and will not ,permit her man-power arid resources to be exploited in the interests of British Imperialism. Nor can India join any war without the express consent of her people. The Congress therefore disapproves of war preparation including air-raid precautions; and if an attempt is iriade to involve India in a war it will be resisted.2.   There is gobd reason td believe that the Working Cdriiriiittee&apos;s plaii, of action, formed in virtue of this obligation, -would have been dictated by Gahdhi, But surmise as to what his decision would have been is rendered difficult by the [18072]
relaxation of the tension which obviated the need for any early pronouncement. It is, however, legitimate to suppose that, in the formation of a decision, Gandhi would have attempted to reconcile (1) his intense preoccupation at the moment with the principle of non-violence, (2) the views of influential followers (e.g., G. D. Birla) that the Congress should not openly oppose or obstruct war emergency measures, and (3) the desire openly expressed by such persons as Jawaharlal Neftru that the opportunity of war should be seized in order to obtain India&apos;s freedom. A Avar against Germany might therefore have produced a Congress policy of passivity, with claims at the most likely moment for constitutional concessions.3. The communications received from Governors of Congress Provinces on the probable attitude of their Ministries are summarised below: United Provinces. Governor discussed with Premier on return from Delhi, mentioning the draft Defence of India Ordinance and the powers conferred by it on Provincial Governments and various forms of action which would have to be taken by them. Premier seemed not to expect any particular difficulty about action which would be inevitably required by the Centre, such as internment of enemy aliens and censorship. Said that the Working Committee had left it to Premiers to comply with normal necessities and to refer for instructions on any vital matter, and any initiative required of Provincial Governments might have to he referred to the Committee. Sympathy with Gandhi&apos;s ideal of non-violence was perhaps more intellectual than practical: Premier himself seemed to feel war against Germany&apos;s aggression justifiable : but India must enter a war voluntarily, like the Dominions, not under orders from Great Britain : Congress should be consulted. If Japan came in, India would be directly concerned and it might be necessary for India to make a really big effort.Sampuranand (Education Minister) not pacifist in any way : expressed view that war would be just and necessary : would like India to play its part provided it can feel that the War is its own.Orissa. Premier would not commit himself; said he had been told to act on orders of Working Committee. Implied that Working Committee would attempt to bargain with His Majesty&apos;s Government.Central Provinces.-GoveTnor discussed with Misra (Minister, who had returned from Delhi meetings). Ministry would take lead blindly from High Command. All-India Congress Committee, believing war unlikely and negotia-tions of Hitler and Chamberlain to be a cloak for Imperial machinations, had been unwilling to show their hand. If war broke out, Gandhi would be given dictatorial powers. Gandhi opposed to active non-co-operation, because no national advantage would accrue from attempt to exploit situation to extreme limits. But Congress would use war as opportunity for wresting further concessions, particularly in connection with Federation, as price for abstaining from causing general upheaval in India.Bombay. Munshi (Home Minister) had, on his own initiative, asked the Secretariat if all arrangements were ready in case of war. Would himself like to support Britain; but Congress attitude would be determined by Gandhi and fore-cast of Gandhi&apos;s plans impossible. Vallabhai Patel?s view was that Congress would not be dragged into war without their consent, and would require to be convinced of the righteousness of Britain&apos;s cause, and would also require advances to secure their consent.Premier, on return from Delhi, said Working Committee would wait for guidance from Gandhi; meanwhile, minor measures, such as rounding-up of enemy aliens, would be carried out; more important measures would have to be referred to Working Committee, which would probably not permit, without a specific decision, measures involving extra finance or active prosecution of war (e.g., assistance for recruiting). Gandhi not likely to attempt a bargain, which he would regard as an unworthy&apos;course, but more likely to stand on principle of non-violence as preventing active assistance in war. Only a small minority in Congress wished to take, advantage of Britain&apos;s difficulties. Haripura resolution might not be applicable to war to rescue Czecho-Slovakia. Congress expects and desires an approach by British authorities to Gandhi or Working Committee.   .
Madras. Premier states that Viceroy should see Gandhi or Congress High Command. If some agreement results, Congress would support Britain. If no agreement reached, or attempt made, Congress Ministries could not remain iii office. Some arrangement with Gandhi should be possible, and Secretary of State might sound J. Nehru in England.Premier would personally favour attempt to extract better constitution onry at end of war, but doubts whether Working Committee is broad-minded enough to adopt such a policy.North-West Frontier Province. Governor saw Premier before Delhi meetings. Premier saw no difficulty in measures such as censorship, surveillance of. suspects, and precautions against enemy aliens. Gave impression that Ministry would be all out to help. Recruiting would go briskly as long as Pathans were not asked to fight in Arabia or Iraq.But Muslim League leaders expected Red Shirts to get completely out of hand, and Ministry to resign to avoid responsibility.Governor thinks Ministry would not resist instructions from High Command, hut Muslims in India would be likely to support Britain and France if other Muslim countries did.Bihar. Governor on the 24th September reported Ministers as anti-German, hut their action would depend on the High Command and left wing.4. . It seems to follow from the Governors&apos; reports that:  (i) No detailed policy had been formulated by the High Command; (ii) Ministries would be permitted to co-operate in minor measures requiredby the Centre, e.g., control of enemy aliens and of the Press; but (iii)&apos; Any more active, or more important co-operation, would have to bereferred to the High Command; (iv) The High Command would expect to be consulted by the authorities, andto be invited to approve participation in the war; (v) If so consulted and invited, the attitude of the High Command wouldbe determined by Gandhi; (vi) It would be unsafe to forecast whether Gandhi would permit any active co-operation : but active non-co-operation would be unlikely.5. It may be relevant to mention considerations which would weigh with the rank and file  (a) A war would bring higher profits to Indian industrialists and agri-culturists and higher wages to industrial workers;(&amp;) Opposition by Ministries to the prosecution of the war, or even merely half-hearted and spasmodic co-operation, would mean the disappear-ance of the Ministries and assumption of control by Governors under section 93 : a danger would then arise of civil disobedience, entailing confusion and interruption of war-time prosperity;(c) A war would widen the gap between the Congress right and left wings,and the right wing would be pushed further towards the British Government;(d) A war would mean negotiations over Federation, and modifications inthe Federal scheme to secure Indian support.How far these considerations would weigh with Gandhi is a matter for surmise. But it appears likely that, along with the hatred of the Fascist, Nazi and militarist Powers, they would induce in the other Congress leaders a desire to give rather more than passive 4 support to Britain : that desire would, however, be subordinated to . Gandhi&apos;s will: and would languish if Congress support were not wooed in the earliest stages of the war./6. It is noticeable that (i) dislike of the recently passed Bill to check anti-recruiting propaganda, and (ii) an estimate of the effect of war on relations between the Congress and Muslim League, do not seem to have entered largely into the calculations of Congress leaders. ; &quot;
