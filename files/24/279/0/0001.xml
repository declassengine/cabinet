pTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1938.SECRET. v ,      Copy No.   4 5CP. 201 (38).CABINET.CENTRAL EUROPE.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, the record of a conversation that I had this afternoon with Mr. Attlee and Mr. Greenwood.H.Foreign O-office, September 16, 1938.Mr. Attlee and Mr. Greenwood called to see me this afternoon. They began by saying that, according to their information from Prague, the feeling in the sense of no further concessions was very tense. Mr. Attlee said that he had been having, this morning I think, a telephone conversation with one of the Socialist members of the Czech Government, who spoke with the Prime Minister in the room. The sense of his conversation was that they had gone to the limit of their capacity, and that they would sooner fight and die than be handed over to the Germans.Mr. Attlee went on to say that the feeling among his friends was hardening against a plebiscite, which they thought was bound to be a complete sham under the present conditions of intimidation, and their general feeling was that a check must be put to the licence of dictatorships. In support of this he quoted the resolution recently published on behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party and others. I asked them whether they meant that, if there were aggression in Czecho-slovakia, they would immediately be prepared to declare war on Qermany. They betrayed some hesitation in answering this question, but eventually said that, if there were aggression in Czechoslovakia and if France honoured her obligations, we should immediately declare ourselves in support of France.I told them that I would report what they had said to the Prime Minister, from whom for the moment I had no further news than they would have been able to read in the newspapers. I had no doubt that he would be anxious, if time permitted, to get in touch with them after his return, but they would realise that he would naturally first wish to have the opportunity of discussion with his own colleagues. On the general question I added that I, of course, understood their point of view, with much of which I was in complete agreement, but that I thought it was of great importance that those who spoke for this country should not place themselves in a position of using language which, in the last resort, they might not be prepared fully to implement.F .September 16, 1938.10052   [17910]
