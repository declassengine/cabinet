October1938.SECRET. ^ Copy No.^CP. 231 (38).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may foe taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.THE ANGLO-ITALIAN AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Cabinet will remember that during the special session of Parliament a series of telegrams was received from Lord Perth (Nos. 642, 843, 646 and 648 of the 3rd and the 4th October see Annexes V to VIII) which raised in urgent shape the question- of Anglo-Italian relations, with special reference to the bringing into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Simultaneously information was received from Paris conveying the decision of the French Government to recognise the Italian conquest of Ethiopia by appointing an Ambassador to the Quirinal with the appropriate credentials. The Prime Minister felt that it was impossible at that time to bring the matter before the Cabinet or Parliament, and accordingly, after consultation with him, I sent on the 5th October a telegram, No. 446 (Annex IX), to Lord Perth in which I asked him to represent to Count Ciano the impossibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government taking action before the reassembly of Parliament.2. In the meantime, Signor Mussolini has withdrawn half the Italian infantry (10,000 men) from Spain, leaving only one division there together with the Italian air force which is under General Franco&apos;s command both on the main-land and in Majorca. Signor Mussolini is arguing that this gesture is on such a scale as to warrant the bringing into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement.3. It should be added that Signor Mussolini has been told that the Cabinet will decide before next session whether or not to bring the Agreement into force, and that, if it decides to do so, pledges to Parliament will involve discussion in the House of Commons and, if necessary, a vote of confidence before the actual step is taken.A ssurances.4. Meanwhile Lord Perth is seeking assurances on a number of points to facilitate the task of His Majesty&apos;s Government before Parliament in the event of a decision by the Cabinet to bring the Agreement into force.A ssurances Given.Up to the moment Lord Perth has secured Count CianO&apos;s consent to public use being made of the following assurances :  (a) That the withdrawal of 10,000 Italian infantry constitutes a with-drawal of more than half the Italian infantry forces in Spain.* A memorandum on these pledges will be found in Annex II.10104   [18093] B
That the remaining forces of all categories will depart when the Non-intervention Committee&apos;s plan comes into execution. (b) That no further Italian troops will be despatched to Spain. ;&apos;      (je) That the Italian Government had never had for a moment the idea ^of sending compensatory air forces in place of. the infantry forces they were withdrawing.A ssurances Requested but not yet Given.(a) In his conversation with Lord Perth on the 5th October (Rometelegram No. 653, Annex X) Count Ciano said that although he could give no pledge, it was quite probable that the remaining Italian infantiy would be withdrawn soon. When pressed by Lord Perth to agree that this should be made public, Count Ciano said that it would not be possible for the Italian Govern-ment to give its consent (Rome telegram No. 254, Saving, of the 15th October Annex XIV).(b) As regards aircraft, Lord Perth was instructed on the 5th October(Foreign Office telegram No. 446 Annex IX) to inform Count Ciano that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government do not intend to add new conditions, but it will make their task much easier if Signor Mussolini could, in fact, make a reduction of Italian air forces in Spain and secure a diminution in their activities. This would be of great value with public opinion here both as regards the immediate issue and also as regards prospects of closer co-opera-tion in wider fields.&quot; This crossed Lord Perth&apos;s telegram No. 653 of the 5th October (Annex X) reporting an interview with Count Ciano in which the latter said that he could not give any assurance that no further pilots nor machines would be sent. He went, on to say : &quot; The present intention was not to send more of these, but any formal undertaking which was made public would result in a considerable weakening of Franco&apos;s position, and it was for this reason that he could not give it to me.&quot; Later, on the 6th October (Rome telegram No. 658), when pressed regarding a reduction of the Italian air force, Count Ciano maintained that. there was, in fact, already a reduction of Italian aircraft, since no fresh aircraft had been sent to&apos; Spain since his interview with His Majesty&apos;s Charge d Affaires on the .20th August, and there was always a certain wastage. Nevertheless, it emerged from Lord Perth&apos;s conversation with Count Ciano on the 14th. October (Pome telegrams Nbs. 254 and 255, Saving, of the 15th October Annexes XIV and XV) that Signor Mussolini&apos;s refusal to give any assurance that no further pilots or machines would be sent was maintained. (o) There remains the question of the bombing of British ships. On the 12th October we instructed Lord Perth (Foreign Office telegram No. 458 Annex XII) to request that, if possible, His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; be empowered by Count Ciano to say that Signor Mussolini had at any rate consented, if he had not - already actually done so, to use his influence with General Franco to put an end to this practice, or at least to refrain from using Italian pilots and machines against targets which may involve damage to British ships.&quot; Lord Perth had already used forcible language on this subject on the 7th October (Rome telegram No. 660 Annex XI) and had received the reply that SignOr Mussolini hesitated to use his influence with General Franco to stop this bombing and that both Count Ciano and the Duce felt sure that the bombing of British ships was in no way deliberate,, but accidental. Finally, in his interview with Count Ciano on the 14th October (Rome telegrams Nos. 254 and 255, Saving, Of the 15th October-Annexes XIV and XV) Lord Perth was told that Signor Mussolini could not give the required assurance.id) Signor Mussolini had been requested to use his influence with General Franco to facilitate Mr. Hemming&apos;s mission. On the 14th October Count Ciano (Rome telegram No. 674) informed
Lord Perth that, though the matter was somewhat delicate, Signqr Mussolini was prepared to use his influence in the sense desired. Lord Perth has now been instructed to enquire of Count Ciano whether he would be willing to include a suitable ; reference to this in any statement that may be made.It should be addfcd that, in Lord Perth&apos;s opinion, if he were empowered to inform Count Ciano and Signer Mussolini at once of the Cabinet&apos;s decision, in the event of its being favourable, ft might possibly be easier to obtain the desired assurances on some of these outstanding points before the debate in Parliament (Rome telegrams Nos. 672 and 677 of the 14th and 19th October Annexes XIII and XVI).Estimate of the Italian Forces in Spain.5. The War Office estimate at the beginning of September put the number of Italian troops at present in Spain as follows : Infantry       ...      ...       ...       ... ... 23,000Artillery..........       ... ... 7,000Engineers     ...       ...       ...       ... ... 2,000Armoured vehicle volunteer personnel ... 1,000Services        ...      ...       ...&quot; ... 8,000Total .............      41,000(In addition there were about 2,000 civilian lorry drivers.) During September there was a special withdrawal of 2,000 sick, wounded and war-weary troops. In contending, therefore, that the withdrawal of 10,000 infantry represents half the Italian infantry in Spain, Count Ciano is, according to pur information, accurate. It is possible that some of the artillery and engineers, together with other services, have equally been withdrawn, but, though this has been reported in the press, there is so far no confirmation.6. As regards the Italian air forces in Spain, the following are the most recent figures supplied by the Air Ministry : Machines.Mainland Bombers    ...      ...       ...       ...      ...        60Fighters    ................100Reconnaissance    ...       ...       - - -      - - - 20Total..........      ... ..- 180Balearics Bombers ...       ... 40Fighters    .........       ...... 30Total    ............ 70Grand total ......... ...         250Personnel Mainland    ...... ...       ... 1,700Balearics    ...       ... ...       ...       ... ...          500Grand total      ../........        2,200      //.It should be added that the Air Ministry have reason to believe that/at locmt half tho machinoo in quootioa have been handed over to, if not already paid for by, the Franco Government.[18093] b 2
The Relation between the Anglo-Italian Agreement and the Spanish Question. .7. It will be recalled that at the time of the signature of the Anglo-Italian Agreement on the 16th April notes were exchanged between Comit Ciano and Lord Perth in which the latter made the following statement: - &apos;      -:&apos;&quot;In this connexion (i.e., the assurances given during the negotiations hj the Italian Government as regards their policy in Spain) I hardly need to remind your Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard a set tie-men t of the Spanish question as a prerequisite of the entry into force of the agreement between our two countries.&quot; a *m***L E^J^cucJTtp^q f rr Ci&apos;f\\.   mdk&amp;^   m**i w ****** *v t**- rUEver since the signature of the Agreement/,the only obstacle to its entry into force has been the settlement of the Spanish question; and this has been con-stantly reiterated in Parliament.8. On the 3rd June, Count Ciano, on the express instructions of Signor Mussolini, spoke to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador very earnestly regarding the early coming into force of the Agreement, and asked for the British Government^ views. On the 17th June instructions were sent to Lord Perth in Foreign Office telegram No. 350 (Annex I), upon which Lord Perth acted on the 20th June, leaving with Count Ciano a written summary of his instructions. The difficulty was clearly pointed out to Count Ciano of defining what constituted a settlement of the Spanish question and emphasis was laid on the point that in considering such a definition it was impossible to ignore British public opinion, and it was made clear that it was out of the question to discuss any waiving of the pre-condition on which the coming into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement was made dependent. It will be seen from paragraph 4 of Lord Perth&apos;s instructions that - Count Ciano was told that something more substantial than the mere acceptance of the British plan would be required before the Prime Minister could represent it as a settlement^ and. that what the Prime Minister had in mind was that, short of the victory of one side or the other, settlement &quot; in the sense of meeting the pledges given must be something which could be shown to have eliminated or to be in process of eliminating the Spanish question as a source of international friction.&quot; It was then suggested that this might be achieved in one of three ways : (a) By the execution of the Non-intervention Committee&apos;s plan.(b) &quot; By the Italian Government, on the acceptance by the Non-intervention committee of the British plan, at once making a unilateral withdrawal from Spain. Apart from other difficulties that this course might present, I fully understand all the difficulties that the Italian Govern-ment would, be likely to feel in adopting it, more particularly as, in order sufficiently to impress public opinion here, withdrawal would have to be on a considerable scale.&apos;,&apos;(c) By bringing about an armistice.9. At that moment His Majesty&apos;s Government were hoping that the Italian Government might be induced to lend their aid in securing an armistice. In the event Signor Mussolini refused even to consider (&amp;) or (c). These three courses, however, remain on record with the Italian Government as definitions of what His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard as a settlement in the sense of meeting the pledges given to Parliament. But it is important to remember that they have never been made public here or revealed to the French Government. At the moment, primarily owing to the delay involved by the difficulties made by General Franco in accepting the Non-intervention Committee&apos;s plan, course (b) is the only one likely to obtain a quick result. (Signor Mussolini&apos;s attitude towards an armistice course (c) has so far as we know undergone no change.)10. In a debate in the House of Commons on the 26th July attempts were made by the Opposition to draw the Prime Minister into a definition of what he meant by a settlement in Spain. In reply to a direct question by Mr. Attlee in the course of the debate, Mr. Chamberlain replied : &quot;I would like to see what happens when the volunteers are withdrawn. If His Majesty&apos;s Government think that Spain has ceased to be a menace to the peace of Europe, I think we shall regard that as a settlement of the Spanish question.&quot;
11.   On the 3rd August the Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires had an interview with the Prime Minister, who assured him that there was no intention of imposing any ; new condition on the entry into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, (see record in Annex III).   On the 10th August Signor Crolla wrote to the Prime Minister a letter (see Annex IV), in which he made the following statement: &quot; Signor Mussolini has now instructed me to inform you that he considers that the situation has now been clarified in the sense that the only condition for the application of the Anglo-Italian Agreement ,of the 16th April is the total, or substantial, wi. ndrawal of volunteers from Spain.&quot; This letter was subsequently acknowledged by the Prime Ministers secretary.12.   It will thus be seen that we have the following commitments : - -(a) In the notes exchanged at the time of the signature of the Agreement,that His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; regard a settlement.: of the Spanish question as a prerequisite of the entry into force of the Agreement between our two countries.&quot; .(b) The Prime Ministers definition on the 26th July that, &quot; if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment think that Spain has ceased to be a menace to the peace of Europe, I think we shall regard that as a settlement of the Spanish question.&quot; In this connexion, see the second sentence of paragraph 4 of our telegram to Rome No. 350 (Annex I).(c) A definition of a settlement of the Spanish question given to the ItalianGovernment on the 20th June, but not made public in this country or communicated to the French, viz., the acceptance by the Non-Inter-vehtion Committee of the British plan, followed&apos; by a unilateral withdrawal of Italian forces &quot;on a considerable scale &quot; sufficient to impress public opinion here. \d) Signor MussolinFs understanding of the situation arising from the Prime Ministers talk with Signor Crolla, that the only condition for the application, of the Anglo-Italian Agreement was the total &quot;or substantial &quot; withdrawal of Italian volunteers from Spain.The problem, therefore, upon which the Cabinet&apos;s decision is required is whether this voluntary withdrawal of 10,000 infantry, in advance of the bringing into operation of the British plan, but unaccompanied as yet by any reduction in the numbers or activity of Italian aircraft and pilots in Spain, fulfils any of the above definitions and therefore warrants the bringing into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Is the withdrawal &quot; on a considerable scale &quot; ? Is it &quot; substantial&apos;&apos; ? Is the settlement something which can be shown &quot; to have eliminated or be in process of eliminating the Spanish question as a source of international friction &apos;&apos; ? (see paragraph 8). Do His Majesty&apos;s Government think &quot; that Spain has ceased to be a menace to the peace of Europe &quot; ?The Italian Point of Vietv.13. It is clear that Signor Mussolini, having made this gesture by unilaterally withdrawing what he regards as a substantial number of his forces from Spain, claims that he has implemented the second definition of a settlement of the Spanish question put to him by Lord Perth in accordance with the instruc-tions sent to him in Foreign Office telegram No. 350 on the 17th June (Annex I) and fulfilled what he understood from Signor Crolla to be the Prime Ministers requirements (see paragraph 11 above). There is also a considerable body of evidence from many sources showing that Signor Mussolini is genuinely anxious that the Agreement should become operative. At this point it is worth emphasising that, until the Agreement comes into force. Signor Mussolini and many bf his principal advisers will never be convinced of the sincerity of the British Govern-ment in their desire to clinch an understanding with Italy and to bury the hatchet. There are still important elements in Italy who argue that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have no real intention of bringing the Agreement into force, that they will continue to procrastinate and pile on fresh conditions to the interpretation of a settlement of the Spanish question and are merely biding their time until they are in a position to wreak vengeance on Italy for her Abyssinian adventure in fact, that the tactics of His Majesty&apos;s Government are what Signor Mussolini terms &quot; chloroformisation.&quot; Suspicious and vindictive by nature, Italians cannot bring themselves to believe that other nationalities are not endowed with
similar characteristics. It is submitted that it is of great importance that -nothing should be done to strengthen this lurking and all too prevalent suspicion of lay His Majesty&apos;s Government open to any charge of bad faith. It is equally pertinent to remember that Signor Mussolini is a lover of the dramatic. If he makes a dramatic gesture he expects a prompt and dramatic response. If he fails to obtain iUhe will sense a rebuff. *Arguments for bringing the Agreement into Force.14.   Against this background I would urge the following arguments in. favour of bringing the Agreement into force :-(a) When the Prime Minister made the condition that the coming into force . of the Agreement should depend on &quot;a settlement of the Spanish question,&quot; there was a danger that this question might precipitate . a European war.   With the conclusion of the. Munich Agreement *rt^e^oU^**tf       an(j with this symbolic Italian withdrawal, coupled with theXwith-drawal of the International Brigade from the Spanish Government side, this danger has now receded. It should thus be easier to adopt a liberal interpretation of the Prime Minister&apos;s condition. (6) The entry into force of the Agreement would restore to Signor Mussolini that liberty of action in deciding his foreign policy which he now lacks. At present he is liable to constant pressure from Berlin, and being uncertain of positive British friendship he finds it difficult to resist.(c) The longer the Anglo-Italian Agreement remains inoperative the more -   closely Rome becomes bound to Berlin.  Recent events are an illustra-tion in point.(d) It is particularly important that Signor Mussolini should be encouraged to regain his liberty of manoeuvre and decision if the contact established at Munich between the four Western Powers is to be maintained and another threat of European war avoided.(e) Every advantage is to be gained by bringing into operation signor mussolini&apos;s undertakings to refrain from intrigues against us in the Near and Middle East. (/) For the Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and British Somaliland failure finally to liquidate the Abyssinian episode is proving most onerous. All frontier, trade and tribal questions are held up pending the coming into force of the Agreement.(g) It would have a steadying effect on the Balkan and other MediterraneanPowers which, so long as the Agreement is inoperative, are appre-hensive of having to take sides in an Anglo-Italian conflict in the Mediterranean.(h) Signor Mussolini understands that His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed to bringing the Agreement into force if a unilateral withdrawal takes place which is &quot;on a considerable scale&quot; or &quot;substantial.&quot; We cannot go back on this without either breaking our word or imposing fresh conditions. It should again be emphasised that neither of the above definitions has yet been made public.(?) It is probably our last chance of bringing the Agreement into force and resuming our former relationship with Italy. If we fail to take this chance, Signor Mussolini will argue that we do not mean business and will probably be forced into a military alliance with Germany, thus finding himself condemned to complete vassalage.(j) It is unlikely to cause alarm in France, since the French Government have already taken the first step to regularise their relations with Italy v by recognising the Italian conquest of Abyssinia and sending an ambassador accredited to the King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia. In fact, the entry into force of our Agreement should make&quot; it easier for us to help in the restoration of Italo-French relations.(k) It is not likely to be viewed as an attempt to undermine the axis, since it is Signor Mussolini who has taken the initiative by his unilateral withdrawal of Italian troops, from Spain and is claiming that this
I gesture should enable the Agreement to come into force.   Italytherefore cannot accuse us of seeking to destroy the axis by bringing the Agreement into force; while Germany, whatever her inner feelings on the subject, has never outwardly condemned the Agreement.Conclusion. ** &apos;15. Judged strictly on the merits of the Agreement, there seems to be every advantage in bringing it into force.. But for our parliamentary pledges, which involved linking up this consummation with the Spanish question, it would nave been open to us to bring it into force last June after we had obtained at Geneva liberty of action in respect of the recognition of the Italian conquest Of Abyssinia. It is-my considered opinion that in.dealing with Signor Mussolini &apos;s withdrawal of half his infantry from Spain we should give a liberal interpretation to the two definitions of a Settlement of the Spanish question as set forth in para-graph 12 (c) and (d) above. But the fact that these definitions have never been made public must not be forgotten. This will not prevent Signor Mussolini frbhi feeling that he has complied with both of them by his present withdrawal, and in certain circumstances ho may be tempted himself to disclose the fact that these definitions were given to hint If we can secure the bringing into force of the Agreement without revealing the fact of these two definitions, it might be the better course; But if any great difficulty is experienced in Parliament,, it might assist us to show the extent to which we are implementing pledges already given. In that event we should obviously expose ourselves to the reproach that we had not taken Parliament into our confidence at the time. Might it not; however, be worse if the revelation came from Signor Mussolini ?     . &quot;\16. We should realise that the Spanish situation has undergone a great change since the time when the Agreement was concluded. It no longer constitutes one of the main dangers to European peace, and the requirement laid down by the Prime Minister on the 26th July (see paragraph 10) has thus been fulfilled; its importance, therefore, as a factor in Anglo-Italian relations has pro-portiohately decreased. In this connexion I would draw attention to the extracts from a recent Foreign Office paper on this aspect&quot; of the question (see Annex XVII).17. I believe that we shall never again, have as good an opportunity of bringing the Agreement into force. I would even go so far as to say that if we do not now grasp this opportunity it may never recur; for we shall risk making the worst of both worlds without securing any advantage in either. Finally, if any advantages are to accrue from the Munich meeting, it is of great importance not to let them evaporate under conditions which would certainly lead to greater misunderstanding.18. I therefore hope that the Cabinet will give its approval to the necessary steps being taken to bring the Anglo-Italian Agreement into force.Foreign Office, October      1938.F .
: ANNEX I.Viscount Halifax to the Earl of Perth (Rome).(No. 350.) Foreign Office, June. 17, 1938.YOUR telegram No. Ill, Saving, [of 4th June : Anglo-Italian relations].^2. You should tell Count Ciano that I much appreciate the frankness with which he spoke to you on 4th June, and share his anxiety that nothing should occur to impair the excellent effects of the signature of the Anglo-Italian Agree-ment, not only as regards our mutual relations, but also as regards the general European situation. His Majesty&apos;s Government readily acknowledge that the Italian Government have, for their part, faithfully fulfilled their side of the agreement by their withdrawal of troops from Libya, by their attitude towards Palestine, and in the cessation of propaganda, and they are, more particularly, grateful for the Italian attitude of helpfulness in matters connected with the Non-intervention Committee.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government are as anxious as the Italian Government to see the agreement enter into force as soon as possible, and, so far as they are aware, the only obstacle appears to be the settlement of the Spanish question. I wish to be entirely frank with Count Ciano on this point. As he must know from your note of 16th April, we have always felt obliged, for reasons with which Count Ciano is familiar, to make quite plain that a settlement of the Spanish question must precede the entry into force of the agreement, and the Prime Minister has given definite pledges on this point. The difficulty remains of defining what constitutes a settlement of the Spanish question. British public opinion cannot be ignored. As Count Ciano will be aware, the agreement was not universally popular at the moment of signature. In the last fortnight the situation has deteriorated to a marked extent owing to the bombing of towns and ships in Spain (see my telegram No. 342 of 1st June), for which the British public holds, rightly or wrongly, the Italian Air Forces in Spain in part at least responsible. It is therefore out of the question to discuss any waiving of the pre-condition on which the coming into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement was made dependent. -4. As Count Ciano must know, it was always contemplated that something more substantial than the mere acceptance of the British plan would be required before the Prime Minister could represent it as a settlement. What we always had in mind was that, short of the victory of one side or the other, settlement in the sense of meeting the pledges given must be something which could be shown to have eliminated or be in process of eliminating the Spanish question as a source of international friction.   This might be achieved in one of three ways :  (a) By the execution of the Non-intervention Committee&apos;s plan.Unfortunately there can be no doubt that even if both sides in Spain were to accept the plan unconditionally, considerable time must elapse before tangible results can be looked for.(Jb) By the Italian Government, on the acceptance by the Non-intervention Committee of the British plan, at once making a unilateral with-drawal from Spain.Apart from other difficulties that this course might present, 1 fully understand all the difficulties that the Italian Government would be likely to feel in adopting it, more particularly as, in order sufficiently to impress public opinion here, withdrawal would have to be on a considerable scale.(c) By bringing about an armistice.Proposals in this sense were outlined in my telegram No. 133, Saving, to Paris [of 7th June], of which you can give Count Ciano the substance. We have now received an affirmative reply from the French Government, who only attach certain conditions which, in our view, need not present any great difficulty. If such an armistice could be arranged with a reasonable prospect of its leading to the establish-ment of peace and with appropriate guarantees against the entry of supplies of men and material to either side during its continuance, and if thereupon substantial withdrawals of foreign nationals from
ANNEX II.Statement of Pledges given to Parliament (1) that Italy&apos;s conquest of Abyssinia would not be recognised de jure, and (2) that the Anglo-Italian Agreement would^not be brought into force without prior discussion in Parliament.(1) De jure recognition.I CANNOT find that any pledge has ever been given that the Parliament would be consulted before His Majesty&apos;s Government accorded de jure recognition of the Italian conquest of Abyssinia. On the 5th May, 1937, in reply to a question by Mr. Adams, Mr. Eden said : &quot; My honourable Friend will, I am sure, understand that it is not possible for me to make a pronouncement on an issue which has not been [18093] cSpain were effected, then His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to regard that as a settlement of the Spanish question. And, on the strength of such settlement, would bring the Anglo-Italian Agreement into force. If the Italian Government were to lead the way in withdrawing a substantial number, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not think it necessary to await equivalent withdrawals from the other side, but would be prepared to consider that as constituting a settlement with the same consequences. His Majesty&apos;s Government would, moreover, hope that circumstances would then rapidly develop in such a way as to enable the Italian Government to regard the armistice as, in fact, terminating the Spanish Civil War, which according to the terms of the Anglo-Italian Agreement should be promptly followed by the complete and final withdrawal of Italian volunteers and war material. You should add that it would appear unwise for General Franco to reject all idea of an armistice. His recent successes have not been attained without considerable loss, and according to the information in the possession of His Majesty&apos;s Government the Barcelona Government are still far from any thought of surrender. General Franco can hardly then look for complete victory in the near future. Hostilities, if pursued to the bitter end, may well drag on into a third year, and the ever-present danger to the peace of Europe resultant therefrom must inevitably grow. They must also entail a further drain upon his resources and increasing damage upon the country which will one day have to be reconstructed, hot to speak of the legacy of hatred which will remain.5. In view of the difficulties attendant on both (a) and (6), I incline very strongly to (c), and hope that, the Italian Government may give it their most earnest, consideration. His Majesty&apos;s Government have some reason to suppose that some elements in. north-eastern part of Spain under the control of the Spanish Government, which favour the Republican side are not indisposed to enter into discussions for an armistice now. If this is in fact so, His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that the present might seem to be a favourable opportunity to apply pressure all round with a view to securing the suspension of hostilities6. This scheme seems to me to afford the quickest and most practical means of bringing our agreement into force, and it would come into force under the happiest auspices if our two Governments could be associated in bringing the war in Spain to an end. Our agreement would then appear not only as restoring the traditional good relations between our two countries, but as affording practical evidence of the influence that our collaboration might contribute to the general pacification of Europe in the future.7. I hope that you may be able to put all the foregoing to Count Ciano, not as a finally formulated scheme of conditions, but rather as a basis on which we can discuss and explore means of extricating ourselves from the difficulty which, I am sure, embarrasses both Governments equally, and from which it is important to find an issue with the least possible delay.(Repeated to Paris, No. 143, Saving (by bag).)
raised, and which, if it were to be raised, would be a matter to be considered by the League  IS Si whole.&quot;We referred to that reply on various occasions later, consistently taking the line that the question of de jure recognition was one for the League as a whole. The decision taken by the Council of the League last May freed us to accord de jure recognition if we saw fit to do so; but the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April has diverted general attention from the isolated question of de jure recognition, and subsequent parliamentary questions have been directed to extracting an assurance that that Agreement would not be brought into force without the prior approval of Parliament.(2) Entry into Force of Anglo-Italian Agreement.The most precise statement that I have been able to find in regard to con-sultation with Parliament before the entry into force of the Anglo-Italian Agree-ment of the 16th April is contained in the reply returned by the Prime Minister to Lieutenant-Commander Fletcher on the 11th July. The Prime Minister said that the Agreement was to be &quot; brought into force on such a date as the two Governments shall together determine. There will be an opportunity for further discussion by the House when that date has been determined.&quot;On the 13th July Lieutenant-Commander Fletcher asked whether the Prime Minister would give an assurance that the Agreement would not be brought into force during the summer recess. The Prime Minister refused to give any such assurance, but referred to his reply to Lieutenant-Commander Fletcher quoted above. &quot; In reply to a supplementary, however, he did say that &apos;&apos; it might be that it would be necessary to call the House together again to consider the matter.&quot; The Prime Minister repeated this last statement on the 25th July.It will thus be seen that, while no assurance has been given that the Agree-ment will not be brought into force without prior consultation with Parliament, there has been an undertaking that there will be further discussion in Parliament when the date for the entry into force of the Agreement has been decided upon.Foreign Office, October 4, 1938.ANNEX III.Note communicated by the Prime Minister&apos;s Private Secretary, August 4, 1938.SIGNOR CROLLA, Charge d&apos;Affaires of the Italian Embassy, called on the Prime Minister at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, the 3rd August. He came to enquire as to the meaning to be attached to a reference by the Prime Minister in his speech in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the 26th July, to a settlement of the Spanish question. The Prime Minister assured him that there was no intention of imposing any new condition on the entry into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. After expressing his satisfaction at this intimation, Signor Crolla drew attention to the fact that, under the time-table published by the Non-intervention Committee, while all volunteers were supposed to have left Spain by the one-hundredth day, another fifty-seven days were allowed before the committee was to certify that the withdrawal was complete. He asked if this certification had to be awaited before His Majesty&apos;s Government considered vtheir condition fulfilled, pointing out that the Russians might delay matters indefinitely. To this the Prime Minister replied that His Majesty&apos;s Government had always reserved to themselves alone the right to say when their condition was fulfilled, and that he personally should consider it fulfilled when the volunteers had gone; he would not consider it necessary to await an official certificate to this effect.C. G. L. SYERS.August 4, 1938.
ANNEX IV.Italian Embassy, 4 Grosvenor Square, W. 1, Dear Mr. Prime Minister, August 10, 1938 (XVI). &apos;WHEN I had the pleasure of seeing you on the 3rd August you were good enough to give me certain elucidations which I did not fail to communicate to Rome.Signor Mussolini has now instructed me to inform you that he considers that the situation has now been clarified in the sense that the only condition for the application of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April is the total, of substantial, withdrawal of volunteers from Spain.In conveying to you this communication from Signor Mussolini, I beg you, Mr. Prime Minister, to accept the expression of my highest consideration.Yours sincerely,GUIDO CROLLA.ANNEX V.The Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 4.)(No. 642.   Immediate.) Rome, October 3, 1938.- COUNT CIANO sent for me this evening and said to me that he had a very important statement to make to me. Italian interest in Spain had now weakened. Italian Government felt that object for which they had originally assisted General Franco, namely, to prevent establishment of communism in Spain, was more or less achieved. In these circumstances, Italian Government had decided, on their own initiative and without reference to the withdrawal on Barcelona side, to withdraw a very substantial part of their forces in Spain. They had therefore given definite instructions that 10,000 infantry should be brought home, constituting a full division. Further, some 2,000 men had recently been repatriated from Spain, though these were mainly sick, wounded and men who wanted to return for special family reasons. The 10,000 men would be con-centrated in Cadiz and leave for Naples. Minister for Foreign Affairs asked that, in order to verify withdrawal, His Majesty&apos;s Government should send observers both to Cadiz and to Naples for the purpose.He then said: &quot;I wish to talk about Anglo-Italian Agreement.&quot; That agreement, he remarked, was signed more than five and a half months ago. Italian Government officially proposed, in view of action they were taking in Spain, it should be put into force now at once. If not, he said, it will lose its interest for Italy. Italian public opinion will never understand that, once more than half of the Italian troops have been withdrawn from Spain, why His Majesty&apos;s Government still hesitate about the agreement. Count Ciano remarked that he had spoken about Spain to the Prime Minister in Munich and that the latter had suggested entry into force of the agreement might perhaps be postponed until a Four-Power Conference had been held about Spain. This the Italian Government considered would constitute a new condition and they could not see their way to accept it. It was not, however, precluded, though he could not take any official engagement, that after the agreement had come into force Four-Power Conference might be held if this was thought desirable. Signor Mussolini had, in view of the great emergency, agreed to go to Munich and assist at conference there, but he must warn me very solemnly that Signor Mussolini would not feel it possible again to participate in a further conference, with representatives of States, however important, which had not recognised the Empire.His personal belief was, though again he could take no official engagement, that once the agreement came into force negotiations between France and Italy could be resumed, even though, in view of the attitude of the French press, this [18093] ^ c 2
would not be easy, and that general European detente would follow. If agree-ment did not come into force, Italian Government would be compelled to adopt a different attitude and to take certain action which up to now they had definitely refused. He said that the Grand Council was meeting on 6th October, that decisions about foreign policy would be taken at the meeting, and he must ask me, if possible, to let him have an answer by then.I replied that, in the first place, time was extremely short. Matter was of greatest importance, and Cabinet would have to meet to discuss it. I doubted whether it would be possible to obtain an answer in such a brief time. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he might of course arrange for discussion on foreign affairs to be postponed perhaps until 7th October, but he observed that, as Italian Government had ordered a withdrawal of troops from Spain on a .&quot; considerable scale &quot; according to condition (b) laid down in the memorandum I had given him on 20th June, he could not see that any long time should be required for a decision. Surely Signor Mussolini&apos;s recent action in supporting and helping recent initiative of British Government ought to tell strongly in Italy&apos;s favour. I said that while I greatly appreciated that action, I could have wished withdrawal had been on a larger scale. Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that withdrawal of more than half of the Italian forces was surely considerable and would be clear evidence to the public that Italy had no territorial or other ambitions in Spain. The theory had been that [group omitted] wished to obtain permanent foothold in the country; this would now be proved to be false. It was not out of the question that within two or three months the rest of the Italian forces might be withdrawn, though here again he would give no pledge. In any event, the remaining Italian forces would depart when Non-intervention Committee plan came into execution. Italian Govern-inent stood committed to previous engagements in this respect. He added, but asked that information should be kept secret, i.e., not used for public statement, that there would remain after withdrawal one division, nine battalions of 700 men each plus certain services.I asked whether some pilots and aeroplanes could not return simultaneously. He replied that this was a new question, and that here again some withdrawals might take place later but hardly at present; the number of pilots in any case was only 150; surely, he urged, it was worth while to accept Italian withdrawal to bring agreement into force and thus to obtain a real European detente which he considered would be the result. He mentioned a possible visit by the Prime Minister to Rome. I emphasised as strongly as I could that.we wanted a with-drawal which would strike public opinion, but Count Ciano reverted to the wording of the aide-memoire of 20th June, and said that Italy would have fulfilled completely the conditions laid down therein.ANNEX V.LThe Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 4.)(No. 643.   Immediate.) Rome, October 3, 1938..MY immediately preceding telegram.I feel that we have come to parting of the ways. If it is possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to authorise me to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they are prepared to put Anglo-Italian Agreement into force and to recognise the Empire once 10,000 troops have either left Cadiz or reached Naples, then I believe that Signor Mussolini.will work for a European detente and general pacifi-cation. If we fail to do so he will consider that although he has fulfilled condition (b) of the memorandum of 20th June by withdrawing Italian troops on a consider-able scale we still refuse to give the desired equivalent and that we have deliberately adopted and are still trying to adopt a policy of chloroforming, and that we have no desire and do not intend to bring agreement into force. Consequently he will conclude a definite military alliance with Germany even though, this is against his innermost wish and would be unpopular in the country. -
* Signor Mussolini is, of course, hoping that his action in connexion with the crisis will receive concrete acknowledgment by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the shape of bringing into force of agreement and recognition of the Empire.I think that he feels while Prime Minister has come back from Munich with a signed agreement with Herr Hitler for consultation with Germany, he, in spite of his active intervention in support of the Prime Minister&apos;s proposals, has been left out in the cold and that the bad boy has secured a reward while the good one goes empty away.; I appreciate that the request for a reply within such a very short time may create a very unfavourable impression. But the Grand Council has already been postponed once and a second postponement would hardly be possible.If His Majesty&apos;s Government consider essence of Italian proposals to be acceptable, then I would suggest that Count Ciano might perhaps give me an official message that Italian Government had decided to withdraw or had with-drawn more than half of their effectives from Spain, thereby effecting a &quot; with-drawal on a considerable scale.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government might send a suitable reply to the effect that in view of this substantial withdrawal the Anglo-Itajian Agreement will come into force immediately.. In any event, we are not asked to bring agreement into force by 6th October, but to indicate that we shall agree to do so, for instance, very soon after troops withdrawn have reached Naples.ANNEX VII.The Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 4.)[By Telephone.](No. 646.  Most Immediate.)     &quot; &quot; Rome, October 4, 1938.&apos; MY telegram No. 642.I fear the words I used therein, viz., &quot;An answer if possible by the 6th October,&quot; may be misleading. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear that the Grand Council which meets from the 6th October to the 9th October would take definite decisions about Italian future foreign policy, and that it was therefore essential to have by then a clear indication of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the Italian proposal for immediate entry into force of the agreement. Count Ciano did not, in fact, mention German-Italian military alliance; his language on this point was very vague. &quot; &quot;We shall have to take up a different line and do things we have not done up to now&quot; represents approximately what he said. This is certainly likely to mean a formal alliance with Germany; the sentence probably implies that the Anglo-Italian Agreement dies and all arrangements connected with it will be ended. Signor Mussolini may also have in mind the withdrawal of Italian Ambassadors from those countries which have not recognised the empire.ANNEX VIII.The Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 4.)(No. 648^.   Most Immediate.)  R. Rome, October 4, 1938.I SAID to Count Ciano that while, of course, I had not yet received any reply from my Government to proposal which he made to me last night there were certain points to which I knew my Government would attach great importance when they considered the matter.Assuming that His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted could they be certain (1) That no further Italian troops would be sent to Spain? Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he could give me, the most definite assurances that-no more would be despatched.   (2) That no further pilots or aircraft should go to Spain?
I remarked that we should not be able to agree to an arrangement by which the Italian Government took away infantry forces but sent instead a number of air squadrons to assist General Franco.  .Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the Italian Government had never for a moment haoMhe idea of sending compensatory air forces. As regards pilots he did not think that there would be much difficulty in giving assurance of the kind I wanted, but he must consult Signor Mussolini. As regards machines this was more difficult. Barcelona Government were continually obtaining supplies of fresh machines, and these came from abroad, since the Government were not able to manufacture aircraft themselves. He would, however, also consult Signor Mussolini on this point, and promised to let me know results this evening. .-.I then made a personal and strong appeal to him that bombing of British ships should cease. He answered that these bombing operations were not in any way under the control of the Italian Government. I answered that perhaps Italian influence could be used with General Franco to help.Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that he would talk to Signor Mussolini and see what could be done. He told me that the 10,000 men were due to leave Cadiz on 16th October and would arrive Naples about 20th October.ANNEX IX.Viscount Halifax to the Earl of Perth (Rome).(No. 446.   Immediate.) Foreign Office, October 5, 1938.YOUR telegrams Nos. 642, 643 and 648 [of 3rd and 4th October : Anglo-Italian Agreement.]1. I have discussed matter with Prime Minister, who, like myself, is personally favourable to early action. We. fear, however, that it cannot be quite so immediate as Italian Government hope. It will be necessary, in view of Prime Ministers position vis-a-vis Parliament, that decision, as soon as it can be taken by Cabinet, should be brought before Parliament. Parliament is now entirely occupied with discussion of Munich Agreement and adjourns to-morrow until 1st November; and it will thus be impossible, before the latter date, to lay the matter before it. I am also bound to say that, from point of view of public opinion here, worst possible impression would be caused if suggestion were made that Prime Minister had felt obliged to take decision under pressure of time-limit suggested in your telegram.2. Signor Mussolini should be under no illusion as to the. difficulties which we are likely to encounter here in bringing the agreement into force. His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate the significance of the withdrawal which Signor Mussolini contemplates, but if there is no reduction of Italian air forces in Spain, and if bombing of British ships continues, we shall have considerable difficulty in carrying public opinion. These difficulties cannot be overcome immediately, even in the better atmosphere that has resulted from Munich meeting and from the decisive part played by Signor Mussolini in bringing that meeting to a successful conclusion. -3. Prime Minister therefore hopes that Signor Mussolini might find it possible and be willing to adjourn discussion at Fascist Grand Council until we may be able to agree on precise measures of withdrawal contemplated, and until we may, as we hope, be in a position to take definitive action.4. If Signor Mussolini can meet us on the point of time, and if he can, in the interval, effect the withdrawal which he now contemplates, Prime Minister will bring matter before Cabinet at first opportunity, and if they agree, His Majesty&apos;s. Government will at once lay matter before Parliament on reassembly.5. His Majesy&apos;s Government do not intend to add new conditions, but it will make their task much easier if Signor Mussolini could, in fact, make a-reduction of Italian air forces in Spain and secure diminution in their activities. This would be of great value for public opinion here, both as regards immediate: issue-and also as regards prospects of closer co-operation in wider fields,
6. You will make it plain to Count Ciano that once matter of this import-ance &quot;has been approved by Cabinet, it will become matter of confidence in the Government when it is brought to Parliament.ANNEX X.The Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 5.)(No. 653.   Most Immediate.)   R. Rome, October 5, 1938.MY telegram No. 648.Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me this morning that, after consulta-tion with Signor Mussolini, he was prepared to give me the most forma! assurance that, if the present Italian proposals were accepted, no further troops would be sent to Spain. ... He added that, although he could take no pledge, it was quite probable that remaining Italian infantry would be withdrawn soon. He could not either give me any assurance that no further pilots nor machines would be sent. The present intention was not to send more of these, but any formal under-taking which was made public would result in a considerable weakening of Franco&apos;s position, and it was for this reason that he could not give it to me. He confirmed that &quot;withdrawal of 10,000 men with their arms would not be compen-sated by increased forces in other respects. He emphasised that as regards Italian forces generally, Italy would maintain the engagements she had taken at Non-intervention Committee.He repeated much of what he had said before about Italy not now being afraid of establishment of a Bolshevik Government in Spain.He indicated, though it would not be fair to quote him on the point, that before long some arrangement between the two sides might be feasible.ANNEX XI.The Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 8.)-(No. 660.   Important.) Rome, October 7, 1938.-     MY telegram No. 658.Count Ciano asked me to come to see him this evening. He said that he had shown memorandum I left with him yesterday to Signor Mussolini. I gather that the latter had not considered it as satisfactory as Count Ciano had done.(R.) Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Signor Mussolini was prepared to wait to end of month, by which time he assumed matter would have been sub-mitted to the Cabinet. I observed that I thought this was likely to be the case, hut it must not be taken for granted that it could be brought before the House of Commons during very first days after it had assembled. Count Ciano stated that Italy was not prepared to take any further action in Spain beyond withdrawing 10,000 men of which he had already spoken. As a matter of fact, the number would probably be slightly larger.I pressed him with all the force I could command about the cessation of hombing of British ships and said to him that, in my view, it was this that roused public opinion at home more than anything else. Minister for Foreign Affairs again claimed that Italian pilots and machines in Spain were in no way under Italian control and solely under orders of General Franco and the Spanish military authorities. I remarked that rumour had it that planes went directly from Italy to Barcelona to drop bombs there and then proceeded to Balearic Islands to refill. Count Ciano categorically denied this was the case! He said all Italian planes and pilots fighting in Spain were based either on Balearic
Islands or on places in Spain. I asked if at least Signor Mussolini would not use his influence with General Franco to stop this bombing of British ships, to which Count Ciano replied that Signor Mussolini hesitated to do so and they  both felt sure that bombing of British ships was in no way deliberate, but accidental.. (End of R.)I had the impression that Signor Mussolini had been in a difficult mood when Count Ciano discussed problem with him, and from an incidental remark of the latter I am not altogether without hope that something more may ultimately be forthcoming from Italian side, and I feel sure that Count Ciano will do his best in this direction.ANNEX XII.Viscount Halifax to the Earl of Perth (Rome).(No. 458.) Foreign Office, October 12, 1938.YOUR telegram No. 660 [of 7th October : Anglo-Italian Agreement].I see from paragraph 2 that Signor Mussolini is prepared to wait till the end of this month, by which time he assumed that the matter would have been submitted to the Cabinet, and I note that you warned Count Ciano, quite correctly, that it must not be taken for granted that the matter would be brought before the House of Commons during the first days after it had assembled. In point of fact, the House can only meet on 1st November for the purpose of prorogation and will not reassemble till 8th November, when the first business must be the debate on the address, which will certainly last several days.It is impossible, therefore, to anticipate precisely at this stage what may be necessary parliamentary time-table, in the event of the Cabinet deciding to bring the matter to Parliament. I am anxious that there should be no misunder-, standing on this point.I approve the language you held in paragraph 3 of your telegram under reference regarding bombing. What strikes the public mind in this country is. that British ships should be bombed by aircraft and personnel over which, rightly or wrongly, they think that Signor Mussolini, if he wished to, could exercise control. It is for this reason that I am so anxious to secure from the Italian Government assurances which I can make public in order to allay these apprehensions.So far as I understand the situation at the moment, we have the following statements by Count Ciano :  (a) That it is not out of the question that within two or three months the restof the Italian forces might be withdrawn.  In any event, the remaining . Italian forces would depart when the Non-intervention Committee,plan comes into execution (your telegram No.-642, paragraph 4).(b) That no further Italian troops will be despatched to Spain (your telegramNo. 648, paragraph 2).(c) That it might be possible to get an assurance that no further pilots should go to Spain (your telegram No. 648, paragraphs 2 and 3).(d) That the Italian Government had never for a moment had the idea of sending compensatory air forces in place of the infantry forces they were withdrawing (your telegram No. 648, paragraphs 2 and 3).The only firm assurances are (b) and (d). I should like to know whether I may make public use of both of them when the appropriate moment arrives; and to-avoid all possibility of misunderstanding you should endeavour to agree with. Count Ciano upon a suitable form of Words to embody them.I need not conceal from you that the above will scarcely suffice to combat the-volume of criticism which 1 anticipate will be aroused in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government deciding to bring the agreement into force. For this; reason it is highly desirable that efforts should be made to obtain valid assurances which can be made public on (a) and (c) above, and that as.regards the question of bombing (see paragraph 1 above) I should, if possible, be empowered, by Count
Ciano to say that Signor Mussolini had at any rate consented, if he had not already actually done so, to use his influence with General Franco to put an end to this practice, or at least to refrain from using Italian pilots and machines against targets which may involve damage to British shipping. I leave to your discretion to choose most appropriate moment and language to attain best results you can secure. For your confidential information, I should hope to bring the matter before the Cabinet at erfd of next week.ANNEX XIII.The Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 14.)(No. 672.) Rome, October 14, 1938.YOUR telegram No. 459.You will see from my telegram No. 670 that I have already taken the action required regarding the Italian support for Mr. Hemming. I hope to know more of Signor Mussolini&apos;s reaction this evening, but, as I have indicated in my telegram No. 660, he is in a stiff frame of mind.As regards the second method suggested in your telegram of approaching the Spanish problem, I am clear that nothing in that line could be usefully attempted in Rome until the entry into force of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Count Ciano has already given me Signor Mussolini&apos;s views about the suggested four-Power conference (see my telegram No. 642), and I have no reason to think that these have altered in any way, indeed rather the reverse. Neither, I fear, will the Italian Government consent to participate in any appeal to General Franco for an armistice. I am convinced,, to put it bluntly, that it is useless for us to expect Italian co-operation for any further measures connected with the cessation of the Spanish war apart from those agreed by the Non-intervention Committee until the agreement has come into force. Once that has taken place, I personally believe that we shall find Signor Mussolini helpful, not averse to a four-Power meeting about Spain, if this were desired, and anxious generally to help towards a European detente.I fully share the apprehension set forth in the penultimate paragraph of your telegram. If it were feasible for me to be informed of the result of the Cabinet meeting towards the end of next week, and if, provided that the decision is favourable, I could pass on the information confidentially to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Signor Mussolini, it would greatly ease the situation and it might possibly be easier to obtain assurances in the sense you desire about bombing and other points set forth in your telegram No. 458, but even then I doubt whether any steps about mediation would be acceptable until Parliament has signified its approval of the agreement. Further, I feel that it is of the first importance to avoid, if possible, keeping Signor Mussolini guessing for another three weeks.ANNEX XIV.The Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 17.)(No. 254.   Saving.) Rome, October 15, 1938.MY immediately following telegram, Saving, contains the text of a memorandum which I handed to Count Ciano yesterday evening. As fore-shadowed in last paragraph of my telegram No. 669, I explained to his Excellency that the memorandum contained certain personal proposals which I submitted to him. After reading it, his Excellency said that as regards the first set, (a), (b) and (c), there was no difficulty whatever; as for the second set, it would not be possible for the Italian Government to agree to (a) being made public. As regards (6), he had already given me Signor Mussolini&apos;s answer. This was also the case as regards the bombing of British ships.[18093] d
I begged him, however, to think over the points I had raised and to discuss them again with Signor Mussolini. &quot;There was no immediate hurry, since if there were to be a debate, it could not take place till after the 10th November, and, in my view, it would be regrettable if these suggestions, which were made, not in any way for bargaining purposes but because I knew the task of the Prime Minister was ,going to be difficult, were rejected immediately by the Italian Government; perhaps events in the near future might facilitate Italian agreement to some of these proposals. In saying this I had in mind the possibilities of a four-Power conference at Venice to deal with the Hungarian-Czech difficulties, about which Count Ciano had already spoken to me, though as you will have seen from my telegram No. 676 this project has now been abandoned. I added that I attached the greatest importance to the coming into force of the agreement, because I believed it would be a great step towards a real detente in Europe.Count Ciano promised to give my memorandum further and careful consideration.  &apos;ANNEX XV.The Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax.-(Received October 17.)(No. 255.   Saving.) Rome, October 15, 1938.- MY immediately preceding telegram, Saving. The following is text of aide-memoire handed to Count Ciano yesterday evening : &quot; Statements which I assume could be used publicly in Parliament.&quot; (a) That the withdrawal of 10,000 Italian infantry constitutes a withdrawal of more than half the Italian infantry forces in Spain.&quot;That the remaining forces of all categories will depart when the Non-intervention Committee&apos;s plan comes into execution.&quot; (b) That no further Italian troops will be despatched to Spain.&quot; (c) That the Italian Government had never had for a moment the idea of sending compensatory air forces in place of the infantry forces they were withdrawing..&apos;&apos; A ssurances which would be extremely helpful if they could be given and made public in Parliament.&quot; (a) That it is not out of the question that within two or three months the rest of the Italian infantry forces will be wihdrawn.&quot;(b) That no further Italian pilots will be sent to Spain.&quot; There remains : &quot; The question of the bombing of British ships.&apos;&apos; I know that it is this point which affects greatly public opinion in my country. It feels deeply the fact that British ships are bombed by aircraft and personnel over which they believe, rightly or wrongly, that Signor Mussolini can exercise control should he so desire.&quot; Would it be possible for Count Ciano to agree to a statement that Signor Mussolini had consented to use his influence with General Franco to put an end to this practice or at least to refrain from using Italian pilots and machines against targets which may involve damage to British shipping. If any suggestion on such lines were acceptable to the Italian Government, I feel convinced that the effect would be great and highly beneficial.&quot;
ANNEX XVI.The Ea?i of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received October 19.)(No. 677.) V&apos; Rome, October 19, 1938.YOUR telegrams Nos. 467 and 468.If Cabinet decision is favourable and if you feel it possible to inform me of it for confidential communication to Count Ciano and Signor Mussolini, who can be thoroughly relied on to keep secret any information of such a character, I would much prefer, for reasons given in last paragraph of my telegram No. 672, to wait for this before approaching Count Ciano afresh about statements which could be used publicly. /ANNEX XVII.Extract from Foreign Office Memorandum dated October 21, 1938.WHILE the world&apos;s attention has been concentrated on the affairs of Central Europe changes of a fundamental character have been taking place in the Spanish situation.The Spanish War originated in the extreme inefficiency of the Spanish Government, whose weakness resulted in the infiltration of Bolshevik elements. This state of progressive chaos was followed by a military revolt.Help for the rebels was immediately forthcoming from Italy, whose action caused serious anxiety in France on account of her land frontier.Spain thus became the danger spot of Europe and the policy of non-inter-vention adopted by the French and ourselves appeared to be the only means of circumscribing hostilities and preventing an outbreak of an open European conflagration.Prior to the crisis in Czechoslovakia there had been no possibility of putting to the test the intentions of the aggressive Powers or the risks they were prepared to take of blundering into war. The policy of non-intervention therefore passed through a precarious phase while foreign intervention was continuing in favour of both Spanish parties under cover of the Non-intervention Agreement, and it was impossible to foretell how far this surreptitious intervention would be pressed.The policy was consequently generally condemned because it failed to put an end altogether to the flow of foreign help and material to Spain for one side or the other. . It never, in fact, set out to achieve this. It was only the ambitious -provisions of some of the later proposals connected with the committee&apos;s non-. intervention plans which gave the public the impression that it aimed at an impossible ideal. Its real object was to keep all the Powers concerned as long as possible round a table in London and thus keep the Spanish War within bounds until such time as it either petered out or the two parties came to terms, or uiitil the intervention Powers grew weary of their efforts and found that there was no profit to them in continuing their assistance.This latter contingency was beginning to manifest itself at the time when the attention of Europe became concentrated on a far more urgent war cloud hanging over Czechoslovakia, v Even the combatants in Spain could not fail to become aware of this new development; which brought home to them the danger in which their foreign connexions placed them of becoming, however unwillingly, involved in the threatening turmoil.Both Spanish parties reacted at once and in the most significant way to the new crisis.The Spanish Government announced at Geneva their determination to remove from their ranks all foreign assistants for the promotion of the war. They asked that a League Commission be appointed to supervise and verify the withdrawal
of foreign elements from the Spanish forces. A commission has been appointed and has proceeded to Barcelona, where the supervisory work is to take place. This action was taken by the Spanish Government ostensibly in order to convince the adherents of General Franco that there was no foundation for their conviction that the Spanish Government was under Bolshevik influence..General Franco, on his side, having received reports that in the event of a European war France intended to occupy Spanish Morocco and possibly Catalonia, proclaimed his neutrality and offered, through His Majesty&apos;s Government, an assurance to the French Government that his military operations were purely a Spanish affair and that he would in no circumstances violate the French frontier, provided he was not himself attacked from that quarter. He hoped that this assurance, given without regard to the obvious interests of his German and Italian advisers, would convince the French Government that their fears for the Franco-Spanish frontier were entirely unfounded. This move was intended to pave the way for better relations between his Administration and the French Government.Even before the crisis became acute, General Franco had, in the hopes of securing an early recognition of his rights of belligerency, consented to the withdrawal of some 10,000 Italian troops, whom Signor Mussolini had decided to remove from Spain. The latter&apos;s motives were partly that this action might bring the Anglo-Italian Agreement into early operation, and partly that he was becoming disillusioned over his Spanish enterprise and disgusted with General Franco&apos;s methods of conducting his military operations. In addition to this unilateral action, the Italian Government professed their readiness to carry out the arrangements for withdrawal of foreigners from Spain under the committee&apos;s plan as soon as that plan was brought into operation.Meanwhile, the European crisis had been settled without recourse to war. It has thus afforded the test of the danger of a general war which had hitherto been lacking, and the absence of which had given the Spanish conflict an inter-national importance out of all proportion to its intrinsic merits.The Powers who did not fight over Czechoslovakia will surely not fight over Spain. A settlement in Central Europe has given them a mass of more urgent problems nearer home to consider, and those among them who have allowed some at least of their volunteers to be withdrawn from Spain can hardly be suspected of the intention of sending others back or of rendering further assistance to the civil war.The original causes of the conflict are also disappearing. The Spanish Government are coping with their extremist elements and hope in this way both to strengthen their own position and also to come to terms with General FrancO,: The removal of some of the Italian forces and Franco&apos;s relations with and. attitude towards his foreign allies has afforded a clear indication that he will not allow himself to be dominated by foreign elements. In both parties the moderate elements are under the surface gaining ground and the abyss which first divided the leaders of both sides is thus being to some extent narrowed. General Franco&apos;s declaration of neutrality vis-a-vis the French in the circum-stances in which it was made should also remove any fear from France of the danger of a Fascist State being established on her southern border.May it not therefore be said that from the international point of view the Spanish conflict is partly losing, if it has not already lost, its importance as.a European powder magazine?
