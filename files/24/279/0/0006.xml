THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1938.SECRET. Copy NorCP, 206 (38).CABINET.CENTRAL  EUROPE.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith two despatches from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris, describing recent conversations between the military attache and members of the French General Staff.H.September 23, 1938.No. 1.Sir E. Phipps to Viscount Halifax. (Received September 23.) (No. 1079.)My Lord, ,        Paris, September 21, 1938.I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith a report by my military attache containing the most recent information which has been supplied to him by the French Ministry of War in regard to the present stage of German mobilisation.2. I would invite your Lordship&apos;s particular attention to the remark made by Colonel Gauche, the head of the Deuxieme Bureau, that &apos;&apos; Of course there will be no European war, since we are not going to fight/&apos; and to his frank justification for this statement, namely, that the French could not face the risk of the German air threat, since Germany&apos;s material was so superior that the French were powerless to deal with it.T have. &amp;o.ERIC PHIPPS.Enclosure in No. 1. Colonel Fraser to Sir E. Phipps.(No. 849.)The Ambassador,IN amplification of my memorandum No. 845 of the 20th September, 1938, the distribution of the German divisions on the Czech frontier, as given to me by General Dentz, is as follows : Silesia 4 Active Divisions (8th, 18th, 28th and 2nd Mechanised). 10063   [17956]
Saxony 4 Active Divisions (4th, 14th, 24th and 13th Mechanised). 1 Armoured Division (3rd). 1 Mobile Division (1st). 1 Reserve Division.Bavaria 3 Active Divisions (10th, 17th and 27th). 1 Armoured Division (1st). 3 Reserve Divisions.Austria-3 Active Divisions (44th, 45th and 7th). 1 Mobile Division (4th). 1 Armoured Division (2nd). 1 Reserve Division.In addition there is the Sudeten Free Corps, which the Germans estimate at 40,000 (possibly exaggerated).On the Western Front, from Aachen to the Swiss Frontier, there are three Army Corps (nine divisions) in the front line, supplemented by units of certain other corps a short distance in rear and at present employed on strengthening the German defensive line in the Rhineland.This may be described as a thin &apos;&apos; couverture &apos;&apos; and by no means able to hold the French if they really meant business. There are, of course, reserves in the interior, of the country and in East Prussia, although a proportion of these are required to watch Poland.But pointed at Paris (and at London) is the threat of the German Air Force, and the Fiihrer found a most convenient ambassador in Colonel Lindberg, who appears to have given the French an impression of its might and preparedness which they did not have before, and who at the same time confirmed the view that the Russian Air Force was worth almost exactly nothing.Yesterday evening I had an interview with Colonel Gauche. I told him that I had been that morning to pay my respects to Lieut.-General Kuhlenthal, the German Military Attache, who was convinced that there would not be a Euro-pean War, to which Colonel Gauche replied, &quot; Of course there will be no European War, since we are not going to fight.&quot; He went on to say that they could not face the risk of the German air threat^-since their material was so superior that they (the French) were powerless to deal with it.To sum up then, the military situation is that the German Army is mobilised, and that it has completed its concentration against Czechoslovakia. The &quot; couverture &quot; in the West is very thin because Hitler is convinced, in spite of all statements to the contrary, that the threat of his Air Force is sufficient to keep the French, and consequently ourselves, quiet under all circumstances. The German Army has been mobilised at leisure under the almost impudent pretext of a practice mobilisation designed to remedy the defects discovered earlier in the year during the annexation of Austria. Czechoslovakia has been prevented from mobilising partly by the covert threat of instant action by Germany if she did, and partly by the exhortations of France and Great Britain, and now she finds herself like a bird in front of a snake, afraid even to take the measures necessary to defend herself.The French estimate, and this is confirmed by our intelligence, that Hitler can press the button at any time from this evening onwards, and that if he does it he will not content himself with the occupation of the Sudeten areas, but will seize the whole of that part of Czechoslovakia which lies between Germany and Austria.Will he do it?v The situation is another triumph for Hitlerian diplomacy. There is every reason, moreover, to suppose that once more it has been achieved in defiance of the opinion of his military leaders, and it cannot fail to increase enormously his prestige with the Army, and, if that be possible, with Germany as a whole.W. FRASER, Colonel,Military A attache.Paris, September 21, 1938.
No. 2.Sir E. Phipps to Viscount Halifax. (Received September 23.)(No. 1081.   Immediate.) y . &apos;HIS &apos;Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit copy of a despatch from military attache, Paris, dated the 22nd September, 1938, regarding German troop movements.Paris, September 23, 1938.Enclosure in No. 2. Colonel Fraser to Sir E. Phipps.(No. 852.   Secret.) The Ambassador,I SAW General Dentz this morning. He told me that the latest information received by the French General Staff was that German troops would occupy Czechoslovakia on the 24th September. The original date had been the 28th, but, on Hitler&apos;s demand, the military authorities had speeded up their preparations by four days.Further, General Dentz said that, in his opinion, when Mr. Chamberlain arrives at Godesberg he will find that the Sudeten question is no longer in the forefront, but he will be faced, in addition, by the demand for the return to Poland and Hungary respectively of the areas occupied by their minorities and for the occupation by Germany of the line of the White and Little Carpathians; a neutral Czech State to be established in Bohemia and demilitarised, and a Slovak State of the same nature east of the W nite Carpathians.I said : &quot;What then, since you don&apos;t intend to fight ? &quot; and went on to suggest that the situation had deteriorated since Colonel Lindberg&apos;s visit and his stories of the German Air Force. General Dentz did not react; he merely pointed out that French cities would be laid in ruins and that they had no means of defence. They were now paying the price of years of neglect of their Air Force.He left me with the. impression that the French did not intend to fight, more particularly as he went on to describe the situation in South-Eastern Europe as it will be after the virtual annexation of Czechoslovakia by Germany, which he appeared to regard as a fait accompli.W. FRASER, Colonel,Military A attache.
