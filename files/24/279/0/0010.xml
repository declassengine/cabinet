Exports of United Kingdom products ( 36.3 million) declined by  6,2 million.EMPLOYMENT.    Employment at 15th August showed a slight improvement as compared with 18th July.      It is provisionally estimated that at 15th August, 1933, the number of insured persons, aged 16-64 in employment in Great Britain, exclusive of persons within the agricultural scheme was approximately 11,402,000.      This was 31,000 more than at 18th July, 1938, but on a comparable basis, about 320,000 less than at 23rd August,  1937.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.      For the four weeks ended 28th August, 1933, railway traffic receipts decreased by  936,000 or 6.7$ compared with the corresponding period of 1937.

The Chamber of Shipping Index number of freights was 126.4 in August as compared with 120.2 in July and 193,3 in August, 1937.      The shipping trades continued to reflect the prevailing political uncertainty.

There was little sign of improvement in the placing of orders during August although employment was maintained &amp;y existing contracts. &apos;FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.      France.    Early in July the Bourse was brighter, hut was again depressed in August.    The franc was subjected to two sharp attacks, but was firmly supported at just under 179.Germany.    During July and August,  share prices on the Berlin Stock Exchange experienced a severe fall, which appears to have been a downward readjustment in the face of decreasing industrial profits, rising taxation,  the depletion of industry&apos;s financial resources, and nervousness about the international situation.Holland.    The economic situation continued to be unsatisfactory, and Stock Exchange prices fell sharply towards the end of August as a result of the international crisis.Switzerland.    The money market remained liquid and share prices reflected the trend in international affairs.      The Swiss franc participated in the improvement of the dollar.United States.    The upward movement in commodity and stock markets continued in July, although in consumer goods rather than in capital goods.      Markets were quieter in August, but there was an improved trend in loans to businesses by New York Banks.    The dollar was strong.COAL,.

The export trades wereunsatisfactory, coal exports in August showing a decline ofi, - 399,000 as compared with a year previously.IRON AND STEEL.    There was little change in the general position, and new business remained moderate.      Output of pig iron in August at 443,000 tons was 271,000 tons less than a year ago.      Production of crude steel at 653,900 tons was 328,800 tons less than in August, 1937*

New registrations of mechanically-propelled vehicles in July were 29,458, a decline of 8,315 compared with the corresponding period of 1937.COTTON.

Sales of food and perishables Increased in value by 4.b% and. of non-food merchandise by 2.8^.      Preliminary returns for August indicate a continuance of this trend;australian .LIAN TRADE.    Imports of merchandise in July were  10.8 million (Australian currency)  compared with  11.0 million last year.      Bales of wool received into store for July were 74,450 as compared with 110,190 last year, quantities sold or shipped being 1,520 and 3,960 respectively.

The drop in Argentine exports and the accumulation of an import surplus during the first five months of this year has been followed by a decline in imports and a small export surplus during June.      The United States has now overtaken Great Britain as the principal exporter to the Argentine.Brazil.    The adverse trend in foreign trade continued during the second quarter of 1938 and hopes of a resumption of the foreign debt service are remote.      Brazil is now recovering lost ground in world coffee markets.
Peru.      There was a substantial fall in exports for the period January to May as compared with a year before, mainlytowing to.a decline in cotton shipments.      The cotton crop for this year is below normal in quantity and quality owing- tt) unfavourable weather and to pests.
