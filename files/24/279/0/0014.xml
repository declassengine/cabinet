October 1938.MOST SECRET.       ^ p Copy No,CP. 214 (38).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.CENTRAL EUROPE.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT the request of the Prime Minister, I circulate to my colleagues herewith records of his conversations with Herr Hitler at Berchtesgaden and Godesberg, Sir H. Wilson&apos;s conversations with Herr Hitler in Berlin and the proceedings of the Munich Conference.H.Foreign Office, October 6, 1938.1. Translation of Notes made by Herr Schmidt, the German Interpreter, of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s Conversation with Herr Hitler at Berchtesgaden, September 15, 1938.AFTER Mr. Chamberlain, in the course of his introductory remarks, had averred that he had always worked for an Anglo-German rapprochement, he said that he now had a feeling that the opportunity of a direct conversation was calculated to improve the relations between the two countries. Before us lay the extraordinary gravity of the situation during the last weeks. He had therefore undertaken the journey to Germany in order, by means of a direct conversation with the Fuhrer, to attempt to clarify the situation.The Fuhrer answered that he was well aware of the full significance of the Prime Ministers journey. The German nation also welcomed it. Fundamentally, he also, the Fuhrer, had always worked in the sense of an Anglo-German rapprochement, as much in his speeches as in his writings. He must, however, admit that in recent years his faith in the possibility of such a rapprochement had suffered very severe blows. Nevertheless, he would regard himself as fortunate if means could be found of improving the political relations between the two nations.Mr. Chamberlain answered that he fully valued the words of appreciation which the Fuhrer had spoken to him. It was, in fact, for a man of his age, no light thing to undertake a journey of this character. The fact that he had undertaken this expedition to Germany should serve as evidence to the Fuhrer and to the German nation both of the importance which he, Mr. Chamberlain,10081   [18028] b
attached to an Anglo-German rapprochement, as well as&apos; of his sincere desire to attempt everything which was possible to find a way out of the present difficulties.His first conversation might perhaps most usefully serve to exchange general ideas in regard to the situation, so that both parties could rightly understand one another and see whether agreement was possible or not. He, Mr. Chamberlain, must frankly &quot;&quot;admit that many Englishmen regarded the* Fuhrer&apos;s speeches solely as words, behind which were concealed carefully prepared plans. He, Mr. Chamberlain, however, regarded the Fuhrer as a man who, from a strong feeling for the sufferings of his nation, had carried through the renaissance of the German nation with extraordinary success. He had the greatest respect for this man, and he had come to Germany in order to seek, by means of a frank exchange of views, the solution of the present difficulties. He hoped that on the basis of this exchange of views with the Fuhrer, that both parties should be precisely informed of the views of the other, and that, on the basis of this precise knowledge of the attitude of the Fuhrer to the various political problems of the day, he could then, with double confidence, work further for an Anglo-German rapprochement.The Fuhrer then declared that above all problems to be discussed stood the Sudeten German question, which at the moment had left the sphere of theoretical expressions of opinion, since the situation was moving from hour to hour to an open crisis. It therefore seemed to him necessary to make a beginning with this question at once since it was decisive for the future development of Anglo-German relations. He did not wish to spend too long discussing the past, for in the past there lay too much separating their two countries and too little in common between them.. What was decisive was whether, and how far in present circumstances, agreement could be reached between the two countries on a common attitude to adopt towards this question.The situation was very grave and a decision must be reached, by one means or another, in the quickest possible time. Under these circumstances he must state quite openly that there would be no point in carrying on. a discussion in the manner of previous diplomatic conversations. The long journey which the Prime Minister had made would not have proved worth while if they Avere to stop short at mere formalities.For a better understanding of the situation he could assure the Prime Minister that the whole importance of his own position rested upon the confidence which the German people had in him. He wras no Dictator, and had not established his power in Germany with military force, but had built it up on the confidence of the nation, whose mouthpiece and representative he was, and whose interests he had to protect. He also, therefore, was not a free agent. He could not go against the promises and assurances which he had once given to the German people and which secured him their confidence. He could not, therefore, either remain silent or inactive in a situation in which the whole German nation expected him to take effective action. Were he to fail to fulfil these expectations he would lose the confidence of the people, and the path he was to take wag therefore deter-mined for him in advance. If other statesmen were subject to the influence of their Parliaments he must govern his actions in accordance with the wishes, not indeed of a Parliament, but of the people and, in particular, of the Party. Were he to fail to do what was expected of him he would not simply do away with the problem at issue but rather undermine his own position.He had; then, given the German people certain promises : first of all to free them, by one means or another, from the suffering caused by the Treaty of Versailles. For the road he had to take to attain that end he had received from the German people a Power of Attorney in the form of an Enabling Act passed by Parliament. If he were not to carry out his promises this Power of Attorney would cease to be valid. Even if this would perhaps have no immediate result, the 4 psjrchological effect of the non-fulfilment of his assurances could be very considerable.He must add that the objective which he had set himself when building up the Party and later the State had been a limited objective. He did not wish to go into details of the reasons for or value and advantages of this policy: he only wished to point out that the fact of the racial basis of the National Socialist Party and with it of the German people excluded any form of Imperialism. Further-more, he had never left the outside world in any doubt that he knew perfectly well how to distinguish between what was possible and what was impossible.  He&apos;knew
that it was impossible to unite all the Germans in Europe. Nor did the German national groups who lived far away from the Reich expect to be united within it. Furthermore he had excluded all questions of this kind which would open afresh old wounds and in which the success to be attained would be disproportionate to the weight of sacrifice involved.People in England Had often reproached him because they thought that appetite grew with eating and that after the attainment of one objective he would always proceed to new demands. But he must draw attention to the fact that no support for this was to be found anywhere in the whole attitude he had taken up. Where Germany had admitted final frontiers, this admission had been carried into effect with a most exact precision in all spheres of policy, literature and practice. The present position was in fact that (1) Germany had brought about an understanding with Poland in spite of comprehensible difficulties.(2) Germany had limited the strength of her fleet, of her own free will, to a certain proportion of British naval power. The precondition for this agreement was, of course, the mutual determination never again to make war on the other contracting party. If, therefore, England Avere to continue to make it clear that in certain circumstances she would intervene against Germany, the pre-condition for the Naval Agreement would cease to hold, and it would be more honest for Germany to denounce the agreement.On the British Prime Minister interpolating the question whether this denunciation would be contemplated by Germany before a conflict broke out or at the outbreak itself, the Fiihrer replied that, if England continued to recognise the possibility of intervention against Germany, while Germany had herself concluded the Naval Agreement with the intention of never again making war on England, a one-sided disadvantage for Germany must ensue; it would, there-fore be more sincere and more honest in such a case to terminate the treaty relationship.(3) Germany had assured Holland and Belgium of treaty guarantees.(4) After the settlement of the question of the Saar, and without taking up again the problem of Alsace-Lorraine, Germany had declared to France that there were now no more territorial questions outstanding between the two countries.Germany had nevertheless put forward a general demand in all clarity : in any circumstances return to the Reich, to which they had belonged for a thousand years, must be made possible for the 10 million Germans who lived in Austria and Czechoslovakia, and whose earnest desire it was to return to Germany. In the case of the 7 million Germans in the Ostmark this demand had been met. The return to the Reich of the 3^ million Germans in Czechoslovakia he would make possible at all costs. He would face any danger and even the risk of war for this end. Here the limit had been reached where the rest of the world could do what it liked; he would not yield a single step.Mr. Chamberlain asked in this connexion whether then the difficulties with Czechoslovakia would be at an end with the return to the Reich of the 3-^ million Sudeten Germans. The question was being asked in England whether this was all that Germany demanded or whether she did not aim beyond this at the dis-integration of the Czechoslovak State.The Ftihrer replied that apart from the demands of the Sudeten Germans similar demands would, of course, be made by the Poles, Hungarians and Ukrainians living in Czechoslovakia, and that in the long run it would be impossible to ignore these demands.The Ftihrer then continued his former argument by referring to the fact that, in the case of Austria, Italy might at first quite understandably have supported her own interests, but that she had recognised the justice of the necessary development of things and had taken up an attitude of truly loyal friendship. He had therefore immediately after the &quot; Anschluss &quot; guaranteed for all time the Italo-German frontier as an expression of the thanks of the whole German nation, and bad thus set the seal on the sincere and lasting friendship between the two nations. Germany&apos;s frontiers with Yugoslavia and Hungary were also regarded as final.There therefore remained only one problem, that of Czechoslovakia, which he would solve by one means or another.  This he was absolutely determined to do.[18028] .-   -.   -&quot;&apos;  b 2
He would do it in his lifetime and would bring about a rapid solution. He was 49 years old, and if against his wishes Germany were to be involved in a world war over the Czechoslovak question, he wished to lead his country through this crisis in the full strength of manhood, and not to have to carry out this task at an advanced age or to leave it to a successor. ,The Czechoslovak question was nevertheless the last major problem to be solved.Finally, Germany would of course always maintain her demand for colonies. This was, however, not a bellicose demand. But it too must one day be granted and Germany would never give it up.With regard to the Czechs he must, however, state once more that he would solve this problem by one means or another. He wished there to&apos; be no doubt of his absolute determination no longer to allow a small subordinate country to treat the great German Reich, with its thousand years of history, as something inferior.Y/ith regard to the Fiihrer&apos;s remarks about the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British Prime Minister observed that he could quite understand the German attitude up to a certain point. A very reasonable agreement had been made about naval strengths in the belief that there could be no question of war between the two countries. If conditions had now so altered that the possibility of a war must be taken into account, the basis of the naval agreement had, indeed, disappeared. Up to that point he could follow the Fuhrer, but he must add that no proper distinction was made on the German side between a threat and a warning. After 1914 England had been reproached on many sides because she had not made her intentions clear enough. The war might perhaps have been avoided, these critics objected, if England had taken up a clearer attitude. When two people are on the point of going into conflict with one &apos; another they must be perfectly clear in advance of the consequences of such a conflict. Britain had acted in this sense, and had made no threats but had only uttered a warning. It was now the business of the Fuhrer to make a decision on the basis of these facts which were known to him. No reproach could be made against England for giving this warning: on the contrary, she could have been criticised for failing to give it.The Fuhrer replied that he could follow the Prime Ministers thoughts to a certain extent, but he believed that things often reached such a point that, after a certain moment, little could be done to change the unalterable course of events. In his opinion a British warning would have come too late in 1914 as well, since the difficulties had by then reached too advanced a stage.Turning to the naval question, the Fuhrer declared that he must adhere to the fundamental view whereby the basis of this treaty was. to be seen simply and solely in a kind of obligation of both parties in no circumstances to make war on one another. If therefore England showed from time to time that she must, nevertheless, in certain circumstances, reckon with a conflict against Germany, the logical basis of the Naval Agreement was done away with. While one party undertook a voluntary limitation of its naval strength, the other party left all possibilities open; and it was precisely at the moment&apos; when a warning was given that the disadvantage for the former party made itself felt.Mr. Chamberlain thanked the Fuhrer for his clear and frank explanations of the German attitude. He believed that he had rightly understood the Fuhrer to say that he had made the demand for the return of the 10 million Germans to the Reich for racial reasons. Seven million Germans had come back to the Reich by the incorporation of Austria. Three and a half million Sudeten Germans must, in any circumstances, be restored to the Reich. But the Fuhrer had given the assurance that, thereafter, no further territorial demands would arise in other spheres which could lead to a conflict between Germany and other countries. He, the British Prime Minister, had also understood the Fuhrer to say that he was ready even to run the risk of a world war in order to secure the return of these 3^ million Sudeten Germans to the Reich. He did not want at the moment to make any further observations than that it must be possible for the Fuhrer and for him to prevent a world war on account of these million Sudeten Germans.He had furthermore understood the Fuhrer to say that Czechoslovakia could not remain like a sort of spearhead aimed at Germany&apos;s side.   If, then, the
Sudeten Germans were to become once more part of the German Reich, would the remainder of Czechoslovakia be still regarded, as a dangerous spearhead at Germany&apos;s side?The Fuhrer replied that this would be the case so long as the Czechoslovak State had alliances witb^ other countries Avhich made it a menace to ^Germany. Moreover, Czechoslovakia had already become a great expense to Germany, for she had made it necessary for Germany to form an air force of double the strength originally intended.The British Prime Minister asked whether German objections regarding this role of Czechoslovakia avould cease to exist if it were possible so to alter the relations between that country and Russia that, on the one hand, Czechoslovakia would be released from her obligations to Russia in the case of an attack on that country, and, on the other hand, if she (Czechoslovakia), like Belgium, no longer had the possibility of obtaining assistance from Russia or another country.The Fuhrer replied that Czechoslovakia would, in any case, cease to exist after a time; for, apart from the nationalities already referred to, the Slovaks were also trying with all their energy to detach themselves from that country.The British Prime Minister referred to the fact that Great Britain was not herself interested in the Sudeten German question as such.. That was an affair between Germans (or Sudeten Germans) and Czechs. Great Britain was only interested in the maintenance of peace.The Fuhrer here interpolated that peace had already ceased to exist in Czechoslovakia. For whole decades the German population of Czechoslovakia had been oppressed, and with the growth of the prestige and power of the German Reich it was gradually beginning to rebel against this oppression. The violent measures taken by Czechoslovakia, the shooting of Sudeten Germans, and the Czech attitude, which, from day to day, took more menacing forms, were certainly not calculated to remove the difficulties. On the contrary, hatred was thereby only increased.The British Prime Minister continued that he, a practical man, had set himself the question how an eventual decision with regard to the inclusion of the Sudeten Germans in the Reich could be carried through in practice. The Sudeten Germans did not live in a compact area, but were fairly scattered, and even if one were to hand over to Germany those areas in which 80 per cent, of the total population was German, there would always remain quite a number of inhabitants of the remainder of the Czechoslovak State who were of German origin. It was therefore not only a question of a new delimitation of frontiers, but, ultimately, also one of a transfer of certain parts of the population.He (the Fuhrer) was, however, afraid that all these discussions were of a purely theoretical nature since the march of events was continuing at a rapid pace. Whole villages in these Sudeten areas had been evacuated. Ten thousand refugees were already on German soil. The number of dead and injured was enormous. It was clear that he could no longer look on inactive at these proceedings. At Nuremberg he had made his intentions clear, and it was a mistake to suppose that those had been but empty phrases.He could under no circumstances look on inactive at these persecutions of Germans, and he was firmly determined to act.The British Prime Minister then proposed to direct a common appeal to both parties in Czechoslovakia to make it possible for mutual conversations to be carried out in a quieter atmosphere. It was clear that, if the information which the Fuhrer had received was correct, conditions in the Sudeten area were practically impossible. But experience often showed that the reports which appeared grave proved on closer examination to be less serious.The Fuhrer then implied that it was impossible for him to address an appeal of this kind to the Sudeten German population. He could not be expected to give the Auctims of Czechoslovak persecution reprimands as well. One should also take into consideration the fact that the nervous tension of the inhabitants of the frontier districts had so increased as to be almost unbearable. From German territory could be heard the sound of artillery fire against defenceless Sudeten Germans. If Germany were to look on inactive, in all these circum-stances, while old German towns such as Eger were attacked by the Czechs, this would in the long run be unbearable.Moreover, one should also take the following facts into consideration. Germany had once, in 1918, taken a wrong step. But in the course of her 2,000 years of history she had always shown herself brave and heroic in action.   And
if Englishmen were just, they must admit that this was also the case in the course of the last Great War. Now Germans regarded the Czechs as cruel and inwardly cowards, and it was therefore not hard to imagine the feelings of the German population when they had to look on while their own countrymen were being oppressed by tfus inferior people. If he (the British Prime Minister) would imagine an England enslaved by a people of this kind, his blood would surely rise just as that of the Germans did in the case of Czechoslovakia.After the Fiihrer had once more emphatically rejected the idea of an appeal to the two parties, the British Prime Minister declared that he was now willing to drop this proposal, but that he must ask why the Fuhrer had let him come to Germany when he (the Fuhrer) was apparently determined to proceed in one quite definite direction and would not consider the idea of an armistice.The Fuhrer replied that he thought it necessary to-day or to-morrow to go into the question whether a peaceful settlement of the question was possible at all. He must, however, emphasise once more that he was firmly determined, in any circumstances, to bring this question to a decision by one means or another in the shortest possible time.Moreover, he observed that Czechoslovakia had made use of the British Prime Minister&apos;s journey to bring about a mobilisation and to call up ten classes of reservists.The British Prime Minister then repeated that, when it was a question of saving human life, all chances of a peaceful settlement must be explored to the very last. He therefore repeated his proposal to bring about a kind of armistice, and added -that he was prepared to consider a pause of this nature narrowly limited in point of time.The; Fuhrer replied that an immediate appeasement in the Sudeten area could only be brought about if the Czech State Police were withdrawn and the troops confined to barracks. It further seemed to him important, in answer to the question about the further continuation of the conversations, what attitude Great Britain took up with regard to the Sudeten area. Did England, or did she not, wish for the separation of these districts and a change in the present constitution of Czechoslovakia? If England could agree to a process of this kind, and if this could be announced to the world as a basic decision of principle, this would no doubt lead to a great degree of appeasement in the districts in question. The question was therefore to know whether Great Britain was now prepared to agree to a separation of the Sudeten German districts on the basis of the right of national self-determination. In this connexion he (the Fuhrer) must observe that this right of self-determination had not been specially invented in the year 1938 for the Czechoslovak question, but had already been called to life in the year 1918 in order to create a moral basis for the changes undertaken by the Treaty of Versailles. On this basis the conversations could continue, but the British Prime Minister must first of all state whether he could or could not accept this basis, i.e., a separation of the Sudeten areas on the basis of the right of self-determination.The British Prime Minister expressed his satisfaction that  he root of the question had now at last been reached. He was not in a position to make categorical statements for the whole British Government. Moreover, he must naturally also consult France and Lord! Runciman. But he could give it as his personal view that, now that he had heard, the Fuhrer&apos;s motives, and now that he. saw the whole situation in a clear light, he was ready to ascertain whether his personal opinion was also shared by his colleagues. He could state personally that he admitted the principle of the separation of the Sudeten areas. The difficulty appeared to him to lie in the practical execution of these principles. He wished, therefore, to return to England! in order to report to the Government and ftto obtain their approval of his personal attitude. At the same time he proposed that clarity should be reached on both sides in their own minds, about the practical method of execution of this principle, for there were a whole number of problems of organisation and administration involved.The Fuhrer declared! that he would gladly save the British Prime Minister a second journey to Germany, for he was much younger and could undertake a journey of that kind; but he was afraid that were he to come to England anti-German demonstrations would complicate rather than simplify the situation. But in order somewhat to shorten the Prime Minister&apos;s journey he proposed for their next meeting the Lower Rhine area, Cologne or Godesberg.
The British Prime Minister then asked the Fuhrer what would happen in the meanwhile, and whether it was not possible to take measures to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.The Fuhrer replied that there did, of course, exist dangers of such a deterioration-fcion, with the result tha^fc the great military machine which Germany had built up would have to be set in motion. But once this machine was in motion it would no longer be possible to stop it. If major incidents, frontier violations and events of that kind were to take place, the danger would increase to the most extreme degree.But even at the risk that this would be represented as weakness, as perhaps the British press would represent it, he was ready to give an assurance that in the course of the next few days, if at all possible, he would not give the order to set the military machine in action, unless a. completely impossible situation were to arise.  In that case, of course, all further conversations would be useless as well.It was clear that everyone in Germany would be glad when the inevitable and essential result above referred! to of the inclusion of the Sudeten Germans in the Reich could be brought about in a peaceful manner. He (the Fuhrer) would be particularly happy if, in connexion therewith, an improvement of Anglo-German relations could be brought about. The attitude of England and France had been incomprehensible to him. While England had given the Irish their freedom without a war, and while the French, in spite of possible economic and military objectives, had allowed the Saar to be returned to Germany, there was talk in both countries of warlike developments in an affair which was to them after all by no means a direct interest. France had allowed a plebiscite to take place in the Saar, but when a plebiscite was to take place in the Sudeten area, was she ready to go to war with Germany, a war which would naturally be a question of life and death ? That attitude was to him completely incomprehensible.The British Prime Minister declared that Great Britain had on her part never taken up an attitude of this kind, but had only sought a just and peaceful solution. Great Britain was.prepared to admit certain principles, and was only concerned with the practical exclusion of these principles. He asked the Fuhrer once more how order could be preserved in the political situation in the few days necessary for the deliberations of the British Cabinet.The Fuhrer replied that the British Government could bring Czechoslovakia to stop her mobilisation measures. These measures might lead to a. second 21st May, and in that case a very serious situation would arise.The British Prime Minister replied that he understood from the Fuhrer&apos;s words that both he and the Fuhrer wished to do everything in their power in order to keep the political situation as quiet as possible during the days in question. The Fuhrer had stated that he could do little with things as they were. But he hoped nevertheless that he would do what lay in his power in order to keep developments in peaceful channels, and he could say, on his part, that he would make every possible endeaArour on his side in that direction.The Fuhrer declared that he also would do everything, but could not issue a public proclamation.Finally, the following short press communique about the conversations was agreed upon : &apos;&apos; The Fuhrer and Chancellor of the Reich held a conversation to-day at Obersalzberg with the British Prime Minister, in the course of which a comprehensive and frank exchange of views took place about the present situation. The British Prime Minister returns to England to-morrow in order to consult the British Cabinet. In the course of a few days a further conversation will take place.&quot;September 15, 1938.2. Notes of a Conversation held at Godesberg, September 22, 1938.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the end of the last conversation at Berchtesgaden the situation was as follows : After he had expressed his personal opinion on the principle of self-determination, he had promised to consult his colleagues. He had gone home and had succeeded in getting not only his colleagues
but the French Government and also the Czechoslovak Government to agree to self-determination in principle. It appeared that the simplest plan was to tell the Chancellor what were the British proposals, and then perhaps to consider how they could be carried out.The Fuhrer &quot;had said at the last meeting that the question of the Sudeten was urgent,, and that a solution could not be delayed, but that a settlement must be reached before any other question could be discussed. This accordingly was the problem which he, Mr. Chamberlain, had set himself to attack. He did not know how much importance the Fuhrer attached to the principle of self-determination as such. But the Fuhrer had said at Berchtesgaden that a distinction must be drawn between the possible and the impossible. The Prime Ministers colleagues had agreed in the course of their deliberations in London, and were also of the opinion that the principle of self-determination need not necessarily be the basis of the existing system in all countries and in all circumstances; otherwise it might cause difficulties all over the world.Once the principle of self-determination had been admitted, however, in the case of the Sudeten, and it was agreed that they should be given the opportunity to return to Germany, the question arose of how this was to be achieved. The first solution which came to mind was that of a plebiscite, but this method gave rise to difficulties, delays, and possibly disorders. Since the Fuhrer had emphasised-sised his desire for a quick solution, it had therefore seemed to all simpler to achieve a settlement not by a plebiscite, but by the agreed cession of territory to the Reich, subject to the proviso that measures should be laid down to enable people to be transferred from one area to another.Some of the districts where there was an enormous preponderance of Germans presented no difficulties; but there were also mixed populations to consider. In the circumstances, when drawing up a new frontier, it seemed that some body must be set up for the purpose of frontier delimitation. They must be given a principle on which to work, and must at the same time have discrimination to draw a line having regard to political, geographical and military considerations, &amp;c, as well as to the wishes of the local inhabitants.He, Mr. Chamberlain, accordingly proposed that we should agree on a guiding principle and appoint a commission to carry it out. One could take as a basis a given proportion of Germans to the whole population, although that was a rough-and-ready calculation, since some Germans might prefer to remain in. Czechoslovakia. Where it was established that, for example, 80 per cent, of the population were Germans, there would, of course be no discussion. But a figure to be agreed upon might be established as a guiding principle for the commission, say, 65 per cent., subject to the use of their discrimination as defined above. The commission would consist of one German, one Czech, and one neutral chairman, with power to make a decision in the event of disagreement between the two other members.We thought it important that an option should be given to populations to transfer, because it was practically impossible to draw a line which absolutely divided Czechs from Germans. There were thus two problems to consider, namely, the transfer of territory and the transfer of populations. The second presented some difficulty, because of the fact that there were obviously a number of persons with property or fixed interests in the territories concerned. In view of this difficulty, it would be necessary to draw such a line as to minimise to the greatest possible degree the necessity for transfer, but, as the Fuhrer had himself recognised during the last conversation, it was impossible to avoid leaving certain minorities behind,, and there must accordingly be adequate safeguards for these people. There was also the question of State property, although this was not an immediate matter. He desired only to mention it, as it would have to be considered later, and he presumed that the German Government would take over such property as buildings, belonging to the Czechoslovak Government, banks, public works, &amp;c, at a valuation. There was similarly the ancillary question of the public debt, and he thought that the German Government would not refuse to take over an agreed proportion of the Czech public debt corresponding to the amount of territory which they received.There was, finally, one more matter which he desired to raise. The cession of the proposed property meant that the existing frontier fortifications would no longer be in Czechoslovakia, and her security would be pro tanto diminished..
He recollected that the Fuhrer had said that he only wished to get this Sudeten question settled and did not want any further territory. Nevertheless, we felt it not unreasonable that Czechoslovakia should want to substitute some other security for the loss of her strategic frontier. We had also considered what the Fuhrer had said at Berchtesgaden *ibout the threat to Germany of the Czechoslovak spear-head at her side. It seemed that the Fiihrer&apos;s objections could be met and the Czech requirements satisfied at the same time, if we substituted the existing Czech alliances, with their military obligations, by a condition of guaranteed security against unprovoked aggression. Consequently, the British Government had agreed to join in guaranteeing Czechoslovakia against unprovoked aggression in the place of her existing treaties involving military obligations. Czechoslovakia would thus be a neutral State, under no military obligations, and would only be guaranteed against unprovoked aggression. He desired to add that this guarantee would not necessarily mean that the present Czech frontiers would be guaranteed in perpetuity. They could be altered by negotiation, as was being done in the present case.HERR HITLER said that he would like to thank the Prime Minister for his great efforts to reach a peaceful solution. He was not clear, however, whether the proposals, of which the Prime Minister had just given him an outline, were those submitted to the Czechoslovak Government.THE PRIME MINISTER replied : Yes.HERR HITLER said that he was sorry, since these proposals could not be maintained. -It was not a question now of doing an injustice to Czechoslovakia, but of redressing grave injustices committed in the past. As a matter of principle a man who has committed an injustice can have no reason for complaint at the restoration to the victim of the rights of which he has been unlawfully deprived. Czechoslovakia was an artificial construction, which was called into being and was established solely on the grounds of political considerations. For this purpose a great wrong had been done to a number of other countries. Three and a half million Germans, against their will, which they vociferously proclaimed at the time, were forcibly incorporated into Czechoslovakia, as well as several million Slovaks together with a territory which was torn by violence from Hungary.and which contained almost a million Hungarians. Furthermore, the Czechs, at a time when the Poles were fighting the Bolsheviks, took advantage of the situation to tear the Teschen territory, containing about 100,000 Poles, from the Motherland. That was the genesis of a State which possessed neither a history nor tradition, nor, indeed, conditions of existence. These other nationalities did not want in any circumstances to be under Czech rule. Representatives of Poland and Hungary had recently visited him and said that they would not in any circumstances agree to their nationals remaining under Czech rule. During the course of 20 years the Czechs had in point of fact been unable to conquer the sympathy of any of these nationals. However that might be, he declared that as Fuhrer of Germany he spoke in the first place of Germans. He had been obliged, owing to the provisions of the Peace Treaties to leave so many Germans in other countries that the interests of Germans were his first care. It was, however, his duty to say that demands were being made by others which had his full sympathy, and peace could not be firmly established until these claims had been settled.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not wish to dissent.   He, theFuhrer, had said that the Sudeten question was of the utmost urgency and thatwas why he had addressed himself to this particular problem.   The others hadnot the same urgency. *,HERR HITLER retorted that, of course, for him as a German this problem was most urgent. But a Pole or an Hungarian would, of course, have maintained that theirs was the most urgent question.However this might be, he (the Chancellor) must emphasise that the problem was now in a most critical stage. In his view no delay was possible, and there seemed to be a slight difference between them as to the urgency of the matter. In his own view, a settlement must be reached within a few days. There were, as the whole word knew, military preparations on both sides, but this situation[18028] c
Gould not be held for very long and a solution must be found one way or another, either by agreement or by force. He desired to say, categorically, that the problem must be settled definitely and completely by the 1st October at the latest.Another consideration which reinforced his view was the unstable situation in Czechoslovakia,. Neither the Prime Minister nor he himself, could say what the situation would be in Czechoslovakia to-day, to-morrow, or in a week. To-day there was a Cabinet crisis, and there might well be a State crisis to-morrow. It was quite impossible, in return for vague assurances, to diminish his watch-fulness or to relax his military preparations. After twenty years of bitter experience the Germans had no confidence in the Czechs, and particularly in Dr. Benes, and would only put trust in Czech, assurances when they were imple-rnented by action. To-day, in Czechoslovakia, people of the streets were being mobilised, and the Bolsheviks were threatening to take the rudder. In the very interests of peace he was convinced that there must be no delay in reaching a clear-cut solution, since, if the Bolsheviks were to get the upper hand, he must say that the conditions for the maintenance of peace were definitely gone. He fully realised that the Prime Minister iand the British Government had done their best to perform the necessary surgical operation on Czechoslovakia in the most peaceful manner, and he was perfectly prepared in principle to co-operate.He added that another consideration present in his mind was the untenable position on the frontier. Since 1918, no fewer than 480,000 Sudeten Germans had emigrated from Czechoslovakia. The latest statistics compiled on the 20th September showed that since the present trouble started the number of refugees had reached the figure of 103,780. Whole villages were empty; in some, the men had gone and the women had stayed, in others, the men had been arrested or conscripted, whilst the women had stayed, whilst in others -there were only the children left wandering uncared for in the streets or the fields. -Meanwhile, the temper of the refugees was rising to fever (heat. These people could not be expected to view the problem with the same equanimity as Mr. Chamberlain and himself in the Conference Room. They had not left their homes for fun. He thought that in many cases they had abandoned their all proved that there was a catastrophical situation in Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, these refugees had swelled to such numbers that it had become impossible to keep them on the frontier and numbers had been moved into the interior of the Reich with the result that in these areas, too, feeling against the Czechs was rising daily.The result of this state of affairs on the frontier was a series of armed clashes. Not only Sudeten but Slovak, Hungarian and Polish soldiers were endeavouring to desert into Germany; in addition there was a constant stream of refugees. The Czechs endeavoured for their part to cut these people off, and there were shooting affrays every night right along the frontier. The refugees, hearing the shooting, crossed the border back into Czechoslovakia to help their comrades  in many cases their own kith and kin. If this situation on the frontier went on for three or four days, there would be a regular frontier war. 2,300 kilom. of frontier was impossible to guard. When considering this state of affairs, it was useless to discuss the question of guilt, responsibility, &amp;c. The fundamental fact was that neither the Sudeten nor the Slovaks nor. the Poles nor the Hungarians wanted to remain in Czechoslovakia, and the Czechs were attempting by force to thwart them.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was both disappointed and puzzled at the Fuhrer&apos;s statement. The Fuhrer had said during their previous conversa-tion that if he, the Prime Minister, could arrange for a settlement on the basis of self-determination he would be prepared then to discuss procedure. He (Mr. Chamberlain) had then expressed his personal opinion as being in favour of the principle of self-determination; he had recognised the basis of the German claim and the fact that it was not possible to expect the Sudeten to remain as citizens of Czechoslovakia. He had induced his colleagues, the French and the Czechs to agree to the principle of self-determination, in fact he had got exactly what the Fuhrer wanted and without the expenditure of a drop of German blood. In doing so, he had been obliged to take his political life into his hands. As an illustration of the difficulties which he had had to face, he mentioned that when he undertook his first flight to Germany he was applauded by public opinion. To-day he was accused of selling the Czechs, yielding to dictators, capitulating, and so on.   He had actually been booed on his departure to-day.
HERR HITLER interjected that he had only been booed by the Left, and the Prime Minister replied that he did not mind what the Left thought, but that his serious difficulties came from the people in his oWn party, some of whom had actually written to protest to him against his policy.: Why, continued Mr, CHAMBERLAIN, were the proposals Avhich he had made not been regarded as acceptable. It was, of course, inevitable that there should be incidents and faults on both sides. At this point, Mr. Chamberlain read a.note which he had just received to the effect that Sudeten bands supported by military had entered Eger, Herr Hitler declared that whatever the report might say, he could declare categorically that German troops had not crossed the border.   It was quite out of the question.THE PRIME MINISTER then picked up the thread of his argument and said that what he had hoped was to show the world that the orderly operation of treaty revision could be achieved by peaceful means. If the Fuhrer had any proposal to make to this end, he would of course be pleased to consider it.HERR HITLER declared that there was only one possibility : A frontier line must be drawn at once he did not hold with commissions, committees, &amp;c, he declared parenthetically from which the Czechs must withdraw the army, police and all State organs; this area would be at once occupied by Germany. The line he proposed to draw would be that of the language frontier, based on existing reliable maps. The Czechs might declare and from his knowledge of them would certainly declare that his line did not represent the real minority situation. If so, he would hold a plebiscite (he did not ask for gifts, nor did he desire to steal territory which did not belong to Germany) on the basis of the situation in 1918 when the Czechs took over the territory; that is to say, the Germans who had since left the territory would be entitled to vote and the Czechs who had since been planted there would not be entitled to vote. In this he would only be following the precedent set by the Saar plebiscite. He was perfectly ready for the plebiscite to be carried out by an international plebiscite commis-sion. The territory would be occupied by German troops at once. But international commissions could be sent out, and, since the plebiscite would not take place for some time he mentioned October or November there would be ample time for proper preparations to be made.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the Fuhrer really thought that it would be necessary to hold a plebiscite everywhere. Surely it would be necessary to hold one only in those areas where the issue was doubtful.HERR HITLER replied that he was in favour of holding a plebiscite everywhere. Where the result showed a Czech majority, he would be perfectly prepared to surrender the territory which he had occupied. He did not envisage given percentages, as suggested by Mr. Chamberlain, but would bow to a majority. In any event, it would be impossible to undertake any sort of frontier delimita-tion until after a plebiscite. The last communal elections were held under Czech terror and could not be considered as a reliable guide. Moreover, arrangements would have to be made for the Germans who had left the territory to vote, whilst the Czechs, as stated above, who had since been planted there would not vote.As regards the question of State property, he declared, with some heat, that the Czechs had no right whatever to indemnification, first, because the Sudeten had paid more in taxation in proportion to their numbers than the rest, and,, secondly, because most of the Czech property was inherited from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and was the fruit, for the most part, of purely German money. The property in question could only be regarded as belonging to the inhabitants, and he must add that any destruction or removal of such property by the Czechs would be regarded by him as a breach of the agreement and he would seek suitable indemnity. To go back to the parallel of the Saar, it was a fact that the Germans had been under Czechoslovak rule approximately as long as the Saar territory had been under the League of Nations administration. The Germans had not been asked to pay the League of Nations for the territory taken over, and there was no reason why they should be asked to do so in the present case.[18.028] c 2
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not intended to go into this question now, but had only raised it as one of the matters which he thought would have to be considered eventually.HERR HITLER said that, as regards the proposed guarantee, it was, of course, as far &quot;as the British guarantee was concerned, the affair of the British Government, and he had no observations to offer. But Germany would only join in such a guarantee if all Czechoslovakia^ neighbours and all the Great Powers, including Italy, also agreed to join in the guarantee.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not asked Germany to join in the guarantee; in fact, he had foreseen this objection, but he thought that perhaps Herr Hitler would agree, to the conclusion of a non-aggression Pact with Czechoslovakia, as he had done with other countries.HERR HITLER said that only if Czechoslovakia succeeded in placing her relations with Poland and Hungary on a proper footing could he agree. The Czechs would regard a non-aggression Pact with Germany as protecting them from any possible pressure on his part, and this would merely encourage them to flout Poland and Hungary and to maltreat the Polish and Hungarian minorities to their hearfs content. His relations with Poland and Hungary were excellent, and he did not desire to stab them in the back.As the spokesman of Germany, he must emphasise that there were only two solutions. First, peace and the establishment of a frontier on a national basis; or secondly, a military solution, which meant a frontier not on a national but on a strategic basis. As for the remainder of Czechoslovakia, it simply did not interest Germany.[At this point I left the room to take a message.]THE PRIME MINISTER said that his proposed guarantee was against unprovoked aggression and both Great Britain and France would object to Czecho-slovakia resisting legitimate claims.HERR HITLER retorted that it was impossible to define provocation or to know who in any given case was the provoker.THE PRIME MINISTER said that many people represented that Herr Hitler wanted to annex Czechoslovakia. He personally did not believe this, but he wished Herr Hitler to help him to prove to his critics that they were wrong. Moreover, he, the Prime Minister, was not a party to these negotiations, but rather only a mediator seeking to achieve a peaceful solution. As it was, public opinion in England was not favourably disposed towards the proposals now under con-sideration, and they would be less favourably disposed if it were known that Herr Hitler was increasing his pretensions. What he would like to be able to do would be to prove that the proposed solution was fair and that the plebiscite was to be held in conditions which ensured freedom from military or other pressure. Again he asked why it was necessary to hold a plebiscite everywhere.HERR HITLER said it was because the Czechs (and he knew them better than anyone) would question everything, and because he, Herr Hitler, wanted a plebiscite to show the Czechs how numerous were the solid blocks which did not want to stay in Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, a plebiscite would enable a fair frontier to be fixed. One would have to take into account regions rather than isolated villages. One particular village might have a Czech majority, but might have to be in a German region, and vice versa.THE PRIME MINISTER asked how Herr Hitler proposed to lay down his ^frontier.HERR HITLER replied that the preliminary frontier would be established on the basis of existing language maps.[There was a short gap here owing to my absence to fetch a message for thePrime Minister.]HERR HITLER continued that he had another demand to make, namely the immediate release of Germans from the Czech police and military forces.   The
Germans had called up no German citizens of Czech nationality because they reckoned on the possibility)? of their having to fight against their own countrymen, and this the German Government would not require of them.THE PRIME MINISTER said he saw no difficulty in satisfying this last demand. The difficulty fey rather in the fixing of an arbitrary line by Herr. Hitler, a line which seemed to him would be much further projected into Czech territory than he had anticipated and which English public opinion would not admit as fair.HERR HITLER said that if English public opinion took that view, it was because their information was based, on the Czech maps used in England.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought that, so far as he was aware, the German and Czech maps which they had seen in London roughly agreed.HERR HITLER said that in any event a plebiscite would prove that the German map and the proposed German line was fair. The population maps of 1910, 1920 and 1930, as well as the latest communal elections, showed how far the Czechs had succeeded in encroaching into Sudeten territory. But under his proposal for the plebiscite, the Germans as they had done in the Saar would come back to vote. The following were the numbers of Germans who had left Czechoslovakia since 1918: Overseas 150,000; in Austria 400,000; in Germany 270,000. All these would be entitled to vote, whilst the 200,000 Czechs planted by the Czechoslovak Government would not be entitled to vote. This was not a revolutionary or unfair proposal. It was based on the model of the Saar plebiscite, which was evolved not by himself or by the German Government, but by high international authorities.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Saar plebiscite was altogether a different matter. In any event, he could only ask once more why it was necessary to resort to the cumbrous procedure of a laige-scale plebiscite. He repeated that he was not here as a party, but as a mediator. He wanted to carry his country with him, and the Fuhrer was not helping him. Under the English proposal Germany would acquire approximately about the same territory as under Herr Hitler&apos;s proposal.; HERR HITLER replied that he wanted a plebiscite because the world would see how many Germans were living in Czech territory against their will. As regards any complaints which might be used against pressure exercised by the German military, he would be prepared to give the international commissions of control full powers. The German military would have nothing whatsoever to do with the plebiscite, and, of course, the German soldiers would have no vote.He, Herr Hitler, could only repeat that there were two solutions, namely (1) a peaceful one, and the drawing of a frontier on a national basis; (2) a military solution, which meant a military or strategic frontier.The Prime Minister had said that his task was not easy, but his the Chancellors was not easy either. The feeling of the German people&apos; was now -such that if he had bowed to their wishes he would not now be negotiating for a peaceful solution. The German people would prefer a solution by force and a military or strategic frontier.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that of course Germany could get what she wanted by the exercise of her might. But such a course would involve loss of life. Moreover, in war there was always an element of hazard, and it was difficult to see why, if Herr Hitler could obtain all that he wanted by peaceful means with complete certainty, he should elect to adopt a course which involved the loss of, German lives and a certain element of risk.HERR HITLER replied that he personally would much prefer a good understanding with England to a good military strategic frontier with Czechoslovakia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would not get a good friendship with England if he resorted to force, but that he would if he agreed to achieve his aims by peaceful means.
HERE, HITLER said that the &quot;decisive element was speed, because whilst they were sitting there they were at the mercy of events, and an irreparable incident could occur at any moment. His solution was the best, because it was the quickest. After the plebiscite which would follow, he would at once return any territory which did not opt for Germany.At this point it was agreed to inspect the map showing the line which Herr Hitler proposed to draw, based on the language boundary. [Herr von Ribbentrop, Sir Horace Wilson and Sir Nevile Henderson joined the discussions at this stage.]HERR HITLER, in reply to a question by the Prime Minister, said that he would be prepared to abide by a bare majority vote in the plebiscite. In reply to a further question, he said that if the plebiscite showed that Germans opted for Czechoslovakia, he would only be too glad to get rid of them. He did not want such Germans in the Reich. If the Prime Minister knew the territory and the people as well as he did, he would agree that the idea of a conflict between Great Britain and Germany on account of such people was simply absurd.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what exactly Herr Hitler meant by applying the result of the plebiscite by regions rather than by towns, villages, &amp;c. Did he have in mind voting by communes, or what were the districts he had in mind ?At this moment Herr Hitler received a message to the effect that twelve German hostages had been shot in Eger. This led him to a disquisition on the iniquity of the Czechs, and on the difficulty he had in refraining from military action against Czechoslovakia.THE PRIME MINISTER further sought to elucidate Herr Hitler&apos;s state-ment that the result of the voting would have to be considered regionally rather than locally.HERR HITLER vociferated, in reply, that after their behaviour during the last twenty years, the Czechs had no reason to complain of any solution. The essential element, he continued, was speed. If Prague fell under Bolshevik influence, or if hostages continued to be shot, he would intervene militarily at once.THE PRIME MINISTER reverted to the question of the plebiscite, and under pressure HERR HITLER agreed that he would have no objection to a plebiscite on both sides of the disputed border.THE PRIME MINISTER then asked Herr Hitler if he would take steps to control the Sudeten whilst we took similar action at Prague.HERR HITLER said that he could give instructions to his army, his S.S. and his police, and they would be obeyed. But he could not communicate with or control the hordes of refugees on the frontier. The solution was for the Czechs to withdraw from the army and police.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if he could not appeal to the Sudeten, he would make a personal appeal to them himself.HERR HITLER replied that this was practically impossible, since there was no Sudeten leadership, no telephonic communication and no one with whom one could get into touch. The Czechs had destroyed the whole organization, and the Sudeten refugees were now a leaderless rabble. So long as shooting affrays continued on the frontier, nothing could prevent the Sudeten from endeavouring to rescue their comrades and kith and kin involved in these affrays.THE PRIME MINISTER said that of course it was impossible wholly to prevent these incidents; they were, indeed, inevitable. But they could do their best and appeal to Prague, and he Herr Hitler could appeal to such Sudeten leaders and organizations as existed.HERR HITLER replied that he would do his best, but that it was an intolerable strain on his nerves to hold his hand in view of constant Czech provocation, when he knew that he could at any moment rout the Czechs with one armoured battalion. The friends of the shot hostages would be shouting to-night for revenge.
After further argument, Herr Hitler said that he would give instructions at once to General Keitel that no military action was to be taken. But Mr. Chamberlain must understand that the Czechs must be spoken to sharply and firmly, or an admonition would have no effect. He never believed himself that a peaceful solution could be reached, and he admitted that he never thought that the Prime Minister could have achieved what he had. That was why he,had made his military preparations and Germany was ready to-day to move at a moment&apos;s notice.After some further desultory discussion the Prime Minister and the Chancellor agreed to adjourn the conversation until the following day.3. Notes of a Conversation between the Prime Minister and Herr Hitlerat Godesberg, September 23-24, 1938.There were also present:Sir Horace Wilson. Herr von Ribbentrop.Sir Nevile Henderson. Herr von Weizsacker.Mr. Kirkpatrick.HERR HITLER said that he and the German people gratefully thanked Mr. Chamberlain for his efforts to secure a peaceful solution of this problem. He, Herr Hitler, knew that it had been a great physical effort for Mr. Chamberlain, and that, in addition, great political courage had been required on his part. Their negotiations were perhaps difficult. But he, Mr. Chamberlain, was an Englishman, and he, Herr Hitler, came from Nieder Sachsen, so that possibly they could in the distant past claim a common ancestor. Nevertheless, however this might be, it was difficult for them to regard this problem on a common basis, for they were obliged to look at it from different angles. For England it was perhaps a matter of general policy; but for Germany it was not only a national question of life and death, but also a question of national honour. All the same, he, Herr Hitler, still entertained the hope of a peaceful solution, and he could only say that, if this happy result were achieved, it would be largely due to the Prime Minister and his efforts.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he much appreciated the words of the Fuhrer, and his reference to his own efforts. He had listened with hope to what Herr Hitler had said regarding the possibility of finding a peaceful solution, but perhaps Herr Hitler could tell him more about that as it had been agreed that afternoon that we were going to have a memorandum to consider.At this point Herr von Ribbentrop produced the German memorandum, stating the German desiderata in regard to the execution of the agreement, already reached in principle, for the application of self-determination for the Sudeten.HERR HITLER said that the memorandum represented essentially the ideas which he had expressed in his letter to Mr. Chamberlain of the 23rd September, supplemented by the verbal statements which he had made.Herr Hitler went on to say that during the last years Germany had had a series of national problems to solve which were absolutely vital to her. Unfortunately, England in each case had. been either disinterested or had taken up an attitude opposed to that of Germany, particularly so far as the press was concerned. This was the first occasion on which Germany had had a feeling that England had endeavoured to solve the problem in favour of Germany&apos;s legitimate interests. If the efforts they were now making to reach a peaceful solution achieved *their object, it might well represent a turning point in Anglo-German relations.  He added that this was the last question that remained open.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Herr Hitler must know that it was or had been his ambition to get a peaceful solution. If it proved possible to achieve this peaceful solution even if it were not agreeable to sections of British public opinion-he was hopeful that the agreement so reached might, as Herr Hitler had described it, be a turning point in Anglo-German relations.    But he,
Mr. Chamberlain, must be able to show to his people that his efforts had met with some response on the German side. He must, however, say that hitherto he had had no such response. He had been told at Berchtesgaden that if he could get the principle of self-determination accepted by the parties concerned, we could then discuss method and procedure. He had succeeded in his task, not only at home, but with the French and Czechoslovak Governments, and he thought that on his arrival at Godesberg Herr Hitler would have been prepared to discuss the application of the principle to the Sudeten. But unfortunately Herr Hitler had categorically refused to consider the proposals which he had submitted. Instead Herr Hitler had adopted the line that this and that must be done, and done quickly, including not merely the immediate cession of both the Sudeten German areas and the mixed areas, but also their occupation forthwith by German military forces.HERE, HITLER at this point interrupted the translation of the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks to interject that the English were faced with a question which they naturally regarded objectively. But this was a problem which moved Germany deeply. In analogous circumstances if Englishmen in a foreign country had been subjected to mal-treatment, if England had been obliged to receive within her borders 120,000 refugees who had fled from such mal-treatment, they would find it impossible to regard the problem quietly. On the contrary, they would view it with the same feelings of deep emotion and exasperation as the Germans were now doing. This state of affairs had lasted fOr 20 years, and he must say -that they could not stand it any longer. They fully recognised and appreciated the English efforts, but for their part the English must understand that the situation demanded a quick solution. In any event, it would not be -entirely fair to regard the present as a test case of German methods.There was another point he desired to make in parenthesis. It was an error if Mr. Chamberlain thought that the Germans had not examined the English proposals. He, Herr Hitler, frankly admitted that he had had no idea originally that Mr. Chamberlain was going to fulfil the role of a mediator. He, Herr Hitler, had been determined to find a solution one way or another, and the methods which he had in view were very different. The latest German memorandum which had now been communicated was, in fact, the German response to English efforts; but for them it would not exist. The people here were ready, if need be, to bring about a German solution of the problem by force, and they would prefer a strategic frontier. He repeated that the memorandum was his response to Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s efforts.THE PRIME MINISTER, whose remarks had been interrupted by Herr Hitler&apos;s intervention, went on to say that if the memorandum only repre-sented what Herr Hitler had said the previous day, public opinion would not be satisfied. He emphasised the risks of a solution by warlike methods and the loss and suffering to vast numbers of people without adequate cause. He could not believe that Herr Hitler would deliberately gamble away all chances of working-together, the prospect of peace and a happy future for Europe merely for the sake of avoiding a delay of a few days. He, Mr. Chamberlain, was not an unreasonable person, and he understood the Fiihrer&apos;s desire for a speedy settle-ment, but to rush things like this was to take fearful chances.HERR HITLER asked what the Prime Minister meant by gambling every-thing away for the sake of avoiding a delay of a few days.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the memorandum and pointed out that it demanded that the Czech evacuation of the Sudeten area should begin on the 26tii September. Apart from anything else this was a quite impracticable date. Then there followed the timetable for German occupations. The whole thing was in terms of dictation, not in terms of negotiation.HERR HITLER retorted that he sincerely believed that the shorter the time limit the greater the chances of definite acceptance.At this point a message was brought in to Herr von Ribbentrop, who-announced in a portentous tone that M. Benes had ordered general mobilisation..HERR HITLER said that in that event things were settled.
THE PRIME MINISTER asked why things must be regarded as settled. Mobilisation was a precaution, but not necessarily an offensive measure. He must point out that there was mobilisation on the other side also.HERR HITLER said that when he talked of things being settled, he meant that the Czech mobilisation was a clear indication that Czechoslovakia did not intend to cede territory. .THE PRIME MINISTER dissented categorically. Czechoslovakia, he said, with the assent of the British and French Governments had agreed to the principle of self-determination, and they would not go back on it.HERR HITLER maintained that if Czechoslovakia was sincerely determined to abide by her acceptance of the principle of self-determination, she would not mobilise.THE PRIME MINISTER asked who mobilised first ?HERR HITLER said!: The Czechs.THE PRIME MINISTER retorted that on the contrary Germany had mobilised first; she had called up reservists and moved troops to the frontier.HERR HITLER replied that when mobilisation was ordered here, Mr. Chamberlain would see the difference between the peace and war strength of the German army.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that Herr Hitler had placed H million men under arms, and had moved his tanks, his aeroplanes and his troops to their appropriate stations. In the circumstances it was not surprising that the Czechs felt themselves threatened. Herr Hitler might declare that he had no confidence in the Czechs, but the latter, in view of what had been done, could not be expected to have much confidence in Herr Hitler&apos;s intentions.HERR HITLER said that he had already declared that the situation could not be held very much longer. No responsible statesman would assent to its indefinite perpetuation.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that there must be an early settlement.HERR HITLER said that the attempts to get a peaceful solution had been going on now for eighteen years.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Herr Hitler had emphasised that he was faced with an unbearable situation. He himself did not dissent. But did the Fiihrer not think that if he decided to achieve a settlement by war, many more persons would be shot ? There would be many more refugees and much more property would be irretrievably lost, even if it were only a localised war. He asked again whether the memorandum represented Hitler&apos;s last word and whether recourse to force was worth the sacrifice when the objective was already completely within his grasp.HERR HITLER said he would quote a German proverb to the effect that &quot; An end, even with terror, is better than terror without end.&quot; He added that the memorandum did, in fact, represent his last word. But quite independently of the problem before them, he must take the appropriate military measures to meet the Czech mobilisation.THE PRIME MINISTER said in that event there was no purpose in negotiating any further. He would go home with a heavy heart, since he saw the final wreck of all his hopes for the peace of Europe. But his conscience was clear; he had done everything possible for peace. Unfortunately, he had not found an echo in Herr Hitler.HERR von RIBBENTROP intervened to say that he did not understand what the Prune Minister meant by declaring that there was no purpose in further negotiation. The Prime Minister had that very afternoon asked for a memorandum, which he proposed to submit to the Czech Government for their immediate reply. The memorandum had now been dtrafted, but without even looking at it the Prime Minister had decided that the memorandum did not represent a possible basis for a peaceful solution. That seemed to him, Herr von Ribbentrop, an altogether novel procedure.[18028] i) -
THE PRIME MINISTER retorted that earlier in the conversation the Fuhrer had declared that the memorandum represented essentially his earlier proposals. If, however, the Fuhrer would consent to hold his hand until a reply was received, he would undertake to transmit the memorandum to the Czecho-slovak Government.HERR HITLER asked what exactly Mr. Chamberlain meant by the words &quot; hold his hand.&quot; It would, of course, be necessary to take immediate military measures in the face of Czech mobilisation.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what Herr Hitler meant by &quot;military measures.&quot;   Did this mean the invasion of Czechoslovakia?HERR HITLER said : No, of course it did not. He had undertaken already not. to invade Czechoslovakia during the negotiations, and he would abide by this undertaking.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had understood Herr Hitler&apos;s under-taking to be a limited one, and that when he talked about taking immediate military measures he meant that the undertaking was at an end. He took note, however, of Herr Hitler&apos;s fresh assurance, which was good so far.In the circumstances he was still willing to send the memorandum to the Czechoslovak Government and to ask them to give us an early reply. In the meantime he would not entirely give up hope of peace until it w^as actually broken.HERR von RIBBENTROP said that he did not altogether understand the Prime Ministers attitude. It was a fact that Czechoslovakia had agreed in principle to the cession of the Sudeten territory. Through no fault of the German Government, however, the situation had seriously deteriorated, and now came the mobilisation ordered by the Czech Government. Mr. Chamberlain complained that he had had no echo here. But what about the echo which he had received from Prague ? It seemed clear that what was wanted was strong-representations at Prague. There was, in fact, no difference of principle between the British, French and Czech Governments on the one hand, and the German Government on the other. The only difference lay in the fact that Herr Hitler deeply mistrusted the Czechs and wanted deeds rather than words and quickly. The mobilisation was evidence of Czech mentality, and would lead to the very-situation which the Prime Minister had been trying to avoid. Mr. Chamberlain had no reason to complain that his efforts had failed in Germany. It was at Prague that the fault lay, and it was there that quick action must be taken.SIR HORACE WILSON, who&apos; meanwhile had been perusing the German memorandum, called attention to the fact that it provided for a detailed time-table for the Czech evacuation of the Sudeten districts and for the immediate occupation by German troops, with dates and even hours. The evacuation must begin on the 26th September and be completed by the 28th.HERR HITLER asked how long he considered the time limit should be.SIR HORACE WILSON replied that communication of the Memorandum meant publication; and this peremptory time limit for the immediate military occupation of territory which was to be ceded by agreement would make the most profound impression on public opinion throughout the world.HERR HITLER replied that if the dates were taken out there would be no end to the ensuing negotiations. Now that Czechoslovakia had mobilised, Germany would take appropriate military measures, and other States might well follow suit.   It was quite impossible for such a state of affairs to last indefinitelyTHE PRIME MINISTER said.that it was his definite opinion that the time limit, as set forth in the Memorandum, would produce a deplorable effect on public opinion in England and probably elsewhere. The Memorandum was an ultimatum and not a negotiation.HERR HITLER said that it bore the word &quot;Memorandum&quot; on the top.THE PRIME MINISTER retorted that he was more impressed by the contents than by the title.
HERS HITLER said that they had now been negotiating for two days. Surely it was not unreasonable that at some point or other, a concrete proposal must be made which would have to be taken or rejected. He repeated that things could not be left as they were.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was to some extent a matter of form. The way in which the proposals were put would inevitably make people say that Herr Hitler was behaving like a conqueror. (Herr Hitler interjected : &quot; No, like an owner of his property.&quot;) It was the behaviour of a victor to a defeated foe. No time was given for the slightest discussion; there was no time even for the practical execution of the necessary measures. &quot;When Herr Hitler said that there was not time to lose, he would agree.HERR HITLER then asked the Prime Minister if he had read the memorandum.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he had already seen a pencilled translation of the most important passages written for him by Sir Nevile Henderson; he did not want to read any more of the memorandum, and if he did it. would not make him change his opinion.HERE von RIBBENTROP asked what exactly were the Prime Ministers objections to the document. General agreement had now been reached in principle to cede the territory. Evacuation, followed by occupation, must come some time or other. The only questin was the question of time. Why did they object to the time ?At this point, after some discussion, it was decided that Herr Schmidt should translate the memorandum orally into English. He did so, and when he came to the words &quot;The following demands are made by the German Government,&quot; the PRIME MINISTER pointed out that it was precisely this sort of aggressive language he had in mind when he criticised the tone of the memorandum. They were ostensibly negotiating a peaceful settlement, and the German Government was putting forward demands.HERR HITLER said that he had no objection to substituting the word &quot; proposal &quot; for &quot; demand.&quot;   The memorandum was accordingly modified.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out at a further point in the translation of the memorandum that the proposal for a German-Czech boundary commission was a slight departure from Herr Hitler&apos;s original ideas, which provided for the choice between an international boundary commission or a German-Czech one.HERR HITLER said that he thought it more practicable to have the work done by a German-Czech commission for the reason that once they had reached that stage he, Herr Hitler, would have no interest whatsoever in trying to incorporate Czechs into the Reich. On the contrary, he would do his best to have as few as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER said that however that might be, public opinion would prefer and would have more confidence in an international commission than in a German-Czech commission; he need not specify why.HERR HITLER said that if that were Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s view, he would readily add the words &apos;&apos; or international commission &apos;&apos; after the words &apos;&apos; German-Czech.&quot;After listening to the provisions of the memorandum dealing with the measures to be taken to put into effect the results of the plebiscite, the PRIME MINISTER examined the German map and asked how it was proposed that the wishes of the voters would be carried out. What, for example, would be the size of the units in which the existence of a bare majority would bring about a transfer from one side to another. After some discussion HERR HITLER said that this would be the task of the German-Czech or international boundary commission. Generally speaking, it was clear that islands could not be moved across the border, but any little blocks on the frontier line could and would be shifted in accordance with the votes to the other side of the border.THE PRIME MINISTER, when the memorandum had been read, said that he would like to repeat that as an intermediary his duty was to transmit proposals and he would do thus.  He had said from the first that the memorandum [18028] d 2
would have a bad effect on public opinion. The Fuhrer had asked him to read the document first and then to tell him why. After hearing the memorandum read he could say once more that the insertion of the dates would have a deplorable effect. The dates in themselves were wholly impracticable; it was now already the 24th September, and th*e Czechs were being required between the evening of the 24th, when the memorandum would reach them, and the morning of the 26th, to accept it and to issue the necessary orders to enable the withdrawal of the troops to begin. But he did not wish to lay stress on the impracticability of the dates, and it would not really help him if the time-table were put forward by a day. The fact remained that laying down a peremptory and rigid time-table of this nature would have a bad effect on public opinion.If Czechoslovakia accepted the memorandum, he, Mr. Chamberlain, agreed that no time should be lost in carrying it into effect. If they accepted, he would do his best to see that they carried it out in a reasonable time, and in this matter he would feel a certain responsibility.HERB, HITLER asked what exactly he regarded as a reasonable time ITHE PRIME MINISTER replied that he could not say now what would be a reasonable time, but he meant a reasonable time, and Herr Hitler could safely trust his sincerity in this respect.HERR HITLER said that the Czech mobilisation was the second of its kind. The first had taken place in May when Germany had not moved a single man. The action of the Czech Government meant counter military measures. Quite apart from the constant incidents on the frontier, to which he had drawn urgent attention, it was manifestly impossible for the German Government to wait indefinitely with 90 or 100 Divisions under arms. Other considerations apart, the cost was prohibitive.He would not be fulfilling his duty to his country if he did not take these military measures. The Czechs might at any moment change their Government and the new Government might reverse the decision of their predecessors in regard to the acceptance of self-determination of the Sudeten and cession of the territory to Germany. In that event His Majesty&apos;s Government would doubtless regard the action of the Czech Government as regrettable, and would condemn it. But the German Government would have to act. In the meantime he would omit the two sets of dates and substitute the 1st October.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could not, of course, either accept or reject &quot;the memorandum; he could only transmit. He appreciated the spirit in which his objections to the form had been made, and he thought that from this point of view, but of course from that point alone, the effect on public opinion would be better.The Prime Minister said that he would like to ask one more question, and he would put it to Herr Hitler for his own satisfaction. Big things were at stake and it would be wrong to forgo the slightest opportunity merely for the sake of a few minutes&apos; talk.Herr Hitler had said that the memorandum represented nis last word, but he had made a number of alterations of form. The question he now wished to put to Herr Hitler related to the occupation of the territory by troops. Under the proposals of the memorandum the whole territory would be immediately occupied by troops. Could the occupation by German troops be confined to that part of the territory only which had a considerable German preponderance, say, for example, 80 per cent.? Acceptance of this suggestion could not possibly make any difference in the end, but it might possibly be found helpful.HERR HITLER replied that the suggestion had, in fact, been previously niooted, and he had discussed it that very morning with his military advisers. In their view such a partial occupation was technically impossible in view of the character of the frontier and the distribution of the population. In some parts the doubtful areas were in pockets, and not on the border at all. If they were not to be entered by troops, troop movements in the whole Sudeten area would be gravely hampered, if not rendered impossible. Many vital roads and railways required by the Military authorities passed through some of these so-called doubtful areas, where the total number of Germans was less than 80 per cent.SIR HORACE WILSON pointed out that the road question would arise whichever of the two provisional boundaries was adopted.
HERR HITLER said there was a further important consideration in his mind. It was precisely in those areas in which the Czechs were the most numerous that it was most important to ensure public order. For this purpose it was necessary to have a strong visible authority, namely, the army. Germany would be responsible for the maintenance of order, and order there would be. , If, after two months, as he confidently anticipated, order reigned in the so-called doubtful areas, there would be no risk in withdrawing the troops for four, six or eight days during the plebiscite.SIR HORACE WILSON said that he was not quite sure that Herr Hitler had understood the Prime Ministers question. He would, therefore, repeat it in unmistakable language. The area shown in the Fuhrer&apos;s map should be the area to be ceded (subject to the method of boundary adjustment proposed in the memorandum), but the proposal for early occupation should be confined to an area based upon an 80 per cent, nationality basis the remainder to be occupied as soon as the results of the voting are known.HERR HITLER replied that he perfectly understood the matter. He would like to point out that there were large German language islands in Czech territory- he did not mention or propose a plebiscite for the large islands in the Carpathians, where the plebiscite would be held with Czech troops in occupa-tion. He did not ask Czech troops not to be in occupation in these areas, for he realised that it would be, for practical reasons, impossible for them to withdraw. But he regarded the occupation of the so-called doubtful areas by German troops as something in the nature of compensation for the presence of Czech troops in the purely German language islands. In any event, he had been convinced by his military advisers that the suggestion of partial occupation was technically impossible, and he regretted, therefore, that it could not be entertained.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was one last question he wanted to put. If the memorandum were accepted, German troops would occupy areas in which there would be Czechs and possibly even some Germans who had worked against the Anschluss with the Reich. What would happen to these people, and how would they be protected ? He did not suggest that they would be necessarily beaten and mishandled, but the question would certainly be addressed to him in England, and he would be grateful if Herr Hitler would provide him with an answer.HERR HITLER said he could only refer him to the experience of the Saar plebiscite. Critics of Germany had averred at the time that at least 100,000 persons would be the victims of revenge. But Herr Hitler was not aware of one single complaint against Germany on this score. The Germans bore.no grudge against a Czech for wishing to be incorporated in his own country; that was the attitude they expected Germans to adopt. If any man in the Sudeten area, however, had murdered a German, he would be well advised to flee in time before the local population wreaked their vengeance on him. As regards Communists, it was high treason to indulge in Communist activities in Germany, and this would apply to the Sudeten territory; but he did not mind and had never minded what a Communist had been before, provided that he abandoned his Communist activities. In general, his object was to exchange populations on both sides as quickly as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER then said he would submit the proposals to the Czech Government as soon as possible, and the conversation terminated.4. Notes of Conversation between Herr Hitler and Sir Horace Wilson at berlin at 5 p.m., September 26, 1938.(Herr von Ribbentrop, Sir Nevile Henderson, Mr. I. Kirkpatrick andHerr Schmidt were present.)The interview began by Sir Horace Wilson handing to Herr Hitler a short manuscript introductory letter from the Prime Minister.SIR HORACE WILSON then said that before asking the interpreter to read the further letter from the Prime Minister (copy attached as an annex) he would like to make a few observations to explain the background and the situation
in England which had called forth that letter. The German memorandum had, as the Prime Minister had anticipated at Godesberg, been published. Opinion in England had been profoundly shocked at its terms.HERE, HITLER interrupted to say that in that event it was no use talking any more. ,SIR HORACE WILSON asked Herr Hitler to listen to his remarks. When the Prime Minister spoke in his letter of the situation being extremely serious he was referring also to the difficulties he was experiencing in England.After the Prime Minister had returned from Berchtesgaden he had believed that Herr Hitler and himself could reach agreement on terms which would fully meet German wishes and have the effect of incorporating the Sudetenland in the Reich. He had succeeded in bringing his colleagues, the French Government and the Czech Government to his way of thinking, because he had convinced them that Herr Hitler and himself had agreed upon a solution within the framework of peace. The country accepted Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s proposals because they trusted him to see that the solution would be on these lines.HERR HITLER interrupted to vociferate in staccato accents that the problem must be solved forthwith without any further delay.SIR HORACE WILSON continued that the Prime Minister fully appreciated this, but the source of the difficulty lay in the manner in which it was proposed to proceed.Here HERR HITLER made gestures and exclamations of disgust and impatience.SIR HORACE WILSON said that he must emphasise again that the Prime Minister fully appreciated Herr Hitler&apos;s feelings and his insistence on speed, but the fact was that it was the way in which the proposals were to be carried out which had shocked and roused British opinion.At this point at Sir Horace Wilson&apos;s request Herr Schmidt began to translate the Prime Minister&apos;s letter. When Herr Schmidt came to the words &quot; the Czechoslovak Government .... regard as wholly unacceptable the proposal,&quot; Herr Hitler left his chair and made to leave the room, muttering that it was no use talking further; the time for action had come.SIR HORACE WILSON begged him to listen to the whole of the letter from which he would see clearly that the Prime Minister understood his impatience and was providing for a quick solution.HERR HITLER brushed these remarks aside with the angry interjection that he could not continue to tolerate a situation which brought 20,000 fresh refugees to Germany every day. M. Masaryk, he declared, branching off on to another tack, had proclaimed in London his intention to overthrow Mr. Chamberlain.SIR HORACE WILSON endeavoured to pacify Herr Hitler and to continue his remarks, but he was interrupted once more by the Chancellor.HERR HITLER declared that it was a question of giving to Germany something in theory but of boggling and delaying the moment it was a question of giving it in practice. Germany was being treated like niggers; one would not dare treat even the Turks like that. &quot; On the 1st October I shall have Czecho-slovakia where I want her.&quot; If France and England decided to strike, let them strike.   He did not care a farthing.SIR HORACE WILSON said that the Prime Minister was appealing to , Herr Hitler.HERR HITLER interrupted to say that it would be better to address an appeal to M. Benes since it was abundantly clear that the Czechoslovak Govern -ment had not the slightest intention of giving up an inch of the territory.SIR NEVILE HENDERSON said that the British Government would see to it that the Czechs did hand over the territory.HERR HITLER indicated by gesture dissent.
SIR NEVILE HENDERSON repeated that His Majesty&apos;s Government would see that the Czedhs handed over the territory; they were in a position to put adequate pressure on the Czech Government. Moreover Herr Hitler surely trusted Mr. Chamberlain.HERR HITLER retorted that unfortunately Mr. Chamberlain might be out of office any day. In any event, he only wanted action, not words. Soon he would have 400,000 refugees from Czechoslovakia in Germany.At Sir Horace Wilson&apos;s request Herr Schmidt, who had not been allowed by Herr Hitler to continue reading Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s letter, resumed translating it, beginning at the point &quot; I learn that.&quot; Herr Hitler only reluctantly agreed to listen to the translation. At the point where the letter talked of a meeting between representatives of the German and Czechoslovak Governments &quot; to discuss,&quot; Herr Hitler ejaculated: &quot;Incredible! Amazing!&quot;HERR HITLER, when the letter had been safely read, said that in his memorandum he had suggested that the Czechoslovak Government should send a representative to Germanj^. But it must be quite clear that this representative would have to discuss not modifications of the memorandum but merely means of executing it integrally. If he (Herr Hitler) could not get the territory Otherwise, he would take it.SIR HORACE WILSON urged that the British and French Governments could ensure that the Czechoslovak Government should hand over the territory. In the circumstances it was quite clear that the Germans could achieve what they wanted by peaceful methods.HERR HITLER interrupted to say that Signor Mussolini had sent him a message to-day to say that he admired his patience. But he could not further justify this patience before the German people. He simply could not allow M. Benes to lead him any further by the nose.SIR HORACE WILSON said that there was no intention of prolonging the negotiations or of allowing delay.HERR HITLER said that there was not only the Prime Ministers position in England to consider, but his own in Germany. He would not tolerate further delaying tactics from Prague.SIR HORACE WILSON said that more was at stake than the position or prestige of individual statesmen. Mr. Chamberlain had hoped that he had found in Herr Hitler a man with whom he could settle this difficult problem by negotia-tion. Once more he begged Herr Hitler to turn the matter over in his mind and to accept the Prime Ministers proposal to have a Czechoslovak representative sent to Berlin.HERR HITLER replied that the Czechs might certainly designate their representative, but it must be clearly understood that he came on the basis of the acceptance of the German memorandum and that there was no alteration in the German decision that the territory should be handed over and should be free of Czechs on the 1st October. Whether by negotiation or whether by the exercise of force, the territory would be free on the 1st October; and if he did not know for certain that the Czechs accepted in the course of the next two or three days the territory might well be cleared of Czechs before the 1st October. On reflection he must have an affirmative reply within two days, that was to say by Wednesday.SIR NEVILE HENDERSON asked, &quot; Midnight, Wednesday? &quot;HERR HITLER replied, &quot;No, by 2 p.m.&quot;Herr Hitler then asked whether it meant that we had abandoned our role of intermediary when we put forward the idea of direct Czech-German negotiations.SIR HORxACE WILSON said it did not and that we still hoped to exercise a Useful influence with the Czechs and we believed we could push through a quick agreement in accordance with the basic German requirements.
HERR HITLER then asked if he might put another question. Could he publish the fact that the Czechs had rejected his memorandum, or was it confidential ? ;SIR HORACE WILSON and SIR NEVILE HENDERSON explained that it was confidential because we still hoped to move the Czechs in the direction of a settlement.  We hoped that in his speech Herr Hitler would not slam the door.HERR HITLER replied that he hoped that Sir Horace Wilson would be present at the Sportpalast, where he could sense the feelings of the German people.SIR HORACE WILSON said that he doubted if he would have time to go, but he would certainly listen on the wireless.HERR HITLER said that he must go in person or he would not get an impression of the intense feeling animating the German people.Anyhow it was no use talking any further.  The time for action had come.SIR HORACE WILSON said he would think over the position and would ask to be received again on the following day.HERR HITLER indicated assent.On the way to the door Herr Hitler started again to inveigh against the Czechs. He said that they had intercepted telephone messages from the Czech Minister in London to M. Benes advising the latter not to cede an inch but to play for time. In the meantime opinion in England could be mobilised and Mr. Chamberlain could be overthrown. The epithets applied to Mr. Chamberlain and to Sir Horace Wilson could not be repeated in a drawing-room. Herr Hitler vociferated that, come what might, by negotiation or by force, Sudeten German territory would be in German military occupation on the 1st October.SIR HORACE WILSON, in taking leave of Herr Hitler, said that he would call upon him the following morning.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1, September 30, 1938.Annex to 4.10 Downing Street, Whitehall, My dear Reichskanzler, September 26, 1938.IN my capacity as intermediary I have transmitted to the Czechoslovakian Government the memorandum which your Excellency gave me on the occasion of our last conversation.The Czechoslovakian Government now inform me that, while they adhere to their acceptance of the proposals for the transfer of the Sudeten-German areas on the lines discussed by my Government and the French Government and explained by me to you on Thursday last, they regard as wholly unacceptable the proposal in your Memorandum for the immediate evacuation of the areas and their immediate occupation by German troops, these processes to take place before the terms-of cession have been negotiated or even discussed.Your Excellency will remember that in my letter to you of Friday last I said that an attempt to occupy forthwith by German troops areas which will become part of the Reich at once in principle and very shortly afterwards by formal delimitation, would be condemned as an unnecessary display of force, and that, in my opinion, if German troops moved into the areas that you had proposed, I felt sure that the Czechoslovakian Government would resist, and that this would mean the destruction of the basis upon which you and I a week ago agreed to work together, namely, an orderly settlement of this question rather than a settle-ment by the use of force. I referred also to the effect likely to be produced upon public opinion.in my country, in France and, indeed, in the world generally.The development of opinion since my return confirms me in the views I expressed to you in my letter and in our subsequent conversation. ,In communicating with me about your proposals, the Government of Czechoslovakia point out that they: go far beyond what was agreed to in the so-called Anglo-French plan. Czechoslovakia would be deprived of every safe-guard for her national existence.   She would have to yield up large proportions
of her carefully prepared defences and admit the German Armies deep into her country before it had been organised on the new basis or any preparations had been made for its defence. Her national and economic independence would automatically disappear with the acceptance of the German plan. The whole process of moving the population is to be reduced to panic flight. &apos;I learn that the German Ambassador in Paris has issued a communique which begins by stating that, as a result of our conversations at Godesberg, your Excellency and I are in complete agreement as to the imperative necessity to maintain the peace of Europe. In this spirit I address my present communication to you.In the first place, I would remind your Excellency that, as the Czecho-slovakian Government adhere to their acceptance of the proposals for the transfer of the Sudeten-German areas, there can be no question of Germany &quot; finding it impossible to have the clear rights of Germans in Czechoslovakia accepted by way of negotiation.&quot; I am quoting the words at the end of your Excellency&apos;s letter to me of Friday last.On the contrary a settlement by negotiation remains possible and, with a clear recollection of the conversations which you and I have had and with an equally clear appreciation of the consequences which must follow the abandonment of negotiation and the substitution of force, I ask your Excellency to agree that representatives of Germany shall meet representatives of the Czechoslovakian Government to discuss immediately the situation by which we are confronted with a view to settling by agreement the way in which the territory is to be handed over. I am convinced &quot;that these discussions can be completed in a very short time and, if you and the Czechoslovakian Government desire it, I am willing to arrange for the representation of the British Government at the discussions.In our conversation, as in the official communique issued in Germany, you said that the only differences between us lay in the method of carrying out an agreed principle. If this is so, then surely the tragic consequences of a conflict ought not to be incurred over a difference in method.A conference such as I suggest would give confidence that the cession of territory would be carried into effect, but that it would be done in an orderly manner with suitable safeguards.Convinced that your passionate wish to see the Sudeten-German question promptly and satisfactorily settled can be fulfilled without incurring the human misery and suffering that would inevitably follow on a conflict, I most earnestly urge you to accept my proposal.I am,Yours faithfully, (Signed) NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.His Excellency the Fuhrer and Reichskanzler.5. Notes of a Conversation between Herr Hitler and Sir Horace Wilson at Berlin at 12 noon, September 27, 1938.SIR HORACE WILSON said that he realised that the Chancellor had much to do, and he proposed to be brief in his &quot;observations. He (Sir Horace Wilson) had listened on the wireless to Herr Hitler&apos;s speech, and he desired to congratulate him on the reception he had received; it must be a wonderful experience for any man to have such a reception.Both the Prime Minister and he himself had noticed with appreciation the references Herr Hitler had made in the speech to subjects mentioned by the Prime Minister. Herr Hitler would by now doubtless have seen the Prime Ministers statement which had been published in the English press.HERR HITLER and HERR von RIBBENTROP said that they had just seen it.SIR HORACE WILSON said that in the circumstances he would not waste time reading it, but he wished to call special attention to the passage in which the Prime Minister had said that he felt himself morally responsible for the[18028] e
execution of the obligation which the Czechs had taken upon themselves. He (Sir Horace Wilson) was going back to London now, and he asked whether he could take any message in the light of the Prime Ministers statement.HERR HITLER said : &quot;No; only that I thank the Prime Minister for all his efforts.&quot; * ,SIR HORACE WILSON said that he would now report to the Prime Minister. The latter&apos;s next step would be to inform the Czechoslovak Government of the situation and ask them to decide.HERR HITLER said that they had only two courses : acceptance of the memorandum or rejection. The memorandum left them every possibility for their continued existence as an independent State. He (Herr Hitler) had given his word and he was in the habit of keeping his word, unlike M. Benes.SIR HORACE WILSON said that he understood the position perfectly and he would inform the Prime Minister.There was, however, one more thing to say, and he would try to say it in the tone which the Prime Minister would have used had he been himself present. Many Englishmen thought that there were many things which ought to be discussed between England and Germany to the great advantage of both countries. He would not waste time by enumerating these matters, but they included arrange-ments for improving the economic position all round. Many in England had noted a speech some time ago in which Herr Hitler had said that he regarded England and Germany as bulwarks against disruption, particularly from the East. In the next few days the coarse of events might go one way or another and have a far-reaching effect on the future of Anglo-German relations generally.They were now faced with two alternatives. If the Czechs accepted the memorandum, well and good. If they rejected it, the question arose where would the conflict end ?HERR HITLER interjected that the first end would be the total destruction of Czechoslovakia.SIR HORACE WILSON continued by saying that, if the Germans attacked Czechoslovakia, the French, as they had told us and as M. Daladier had stated publicly, would feel that they would be obliged to fulfil their treaty obligations. If that meant that the forces of France became actively engaged in hostilities against Germany (Herr Hitler interjected : &quot; That means if France attacks, since I have no intention of attacking France &quot;), the British Government would feel obliged to support her.HERR HITLER and HERR von RIBBENTROP both declared that, since Germany did not wish to attack France, the case of British participation could only arise if France attacked.Herr Hitler continued that what it boiled down to was that, if France elected to attack Germany, Great Britain was under an obligation to attack Germany also.  He could only take note of this communication.SIR HORACE WILSON said that it was clear Herr Hitler had not under-stood his statement. He would repeat.it once more slowly as the wording was extremely important. The situation was as follows : if Czechoslovakia accepted, well and good. If she refused and Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, France, as she had informed us, would feel that she must fulfil her treaty obligations, (Herr Hitler interjected once more : &quot; Which means that France must attack Germany.&quot;)Sir Horace Wilson continued by pointing out that he was using a particular form of words with care. The French Prime Minister had not said that France would attack Germany; he had said that France would fulfil her obligations. We did not know exactly in what form the French would decide to fulfil their obligations, but if in the fulfilment of these obligations France decided that her forces must become actively engaged (Herr Hitler interjected: &quot; To attack&quot;), then for reasons and grounds which would be clear to Herr Hitler and to all students of the international situation, Great Britain would be obliged to support her.
HERR HITLER repeated that it all boiled down to the following : if France attacked Germany, then Great Britain would support France and we should all be at war in six days. He (Herr Hitler) would, unless the Czechs accepted his memorandum, smash Czechoslovakia, then France would feel bound to fulfil her obligations and then Great Britain would also feel bound to fulfil her obligations. Speaking excitedly, he said that the real meaning was that, if France decided to attack Germany, then England would have to attack Germany also.SIR HORACE WILSON demurred, but-HERR HITLER interrupted him to say that the Czechs were faced with two alternatives. But he was convinced that they would reject the memorandum because they were sure now of getting French and British support. He would repeat that he would smash Czechoslovakia if they rejected his proposals. Whereupon France would attack Germany; whereupon England would also attack Germany. So in six days we should all be at war with one another simply because Czechoslovakia refused a proposal which meant the execution of obligations she had already undertaken.Herr Hitler added that in any event he had made preparations for all emergencies. It was not for nothing that he had spent 4-^ billion marks on fortifications in the west.SIR HORACE WILSON said that we must find a way to avoid war.HERR HITLER said decisively that there was only one way and it was a simple way. It was to tell the Czechs categorically to stop their frivolous game of precipitating.a world war and fulfil their undertakings. He used the term &quot;frivolous&quot; because the Powers were faced with a situation in which a small nation was playing for a world war simply because it could not bring itself to carry out its promises. Speaking very bitterly Herr Hitler said that what he resented was that Czechoslovakia seemed to be more important in English eyes than Germany.At this point Sir Horace Wilson rose to go; on the way to the door Herr Hitler again asked him to convey to the Prime Minister and to His Majesty&apos;s Government his thanks for the efforts they had made to avoid a conflict. He could not believe that Germany and England could find themselves at war, and he hoped we would do our best to effect a settlement.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1, September 30, 1938.6. The Munich Conference, September 29, 1938.The following is a brief account (written from memory) of the meetings at Munich which resulted in the Agreement of the Four Powers (Great Britain, Germany, France and Italy) for the settlement of the Czechoslovak question. [The organisation of the Conference was very imperfect, and there appeared to be no arrangements for the taking of notes. A Secretary-General had been appointed, but he took no part in the Conference for the first four or five hours, and was only one unit in the chaos that ruled for the last five hours.]On arrival at Munich aerodrome at noon on the 29th September we were at once taken by car to the &quot; Fuhrer House &quot; and were informed that arrangements had been made to begin the Conference at once. After a short ceremonial meeting, the Conference assembled at 12 - 30.  Those present were :  Germany  France-Herr Hitler. The French Prime Minister.t   Herr von Ribbentrop. M. Leger.Herr von Weizsacker.Great Britain  Italy The Prime Minister. Signor Mussolini.Sir Horace Wilson. Count Ciano.Herr Schmidt-Interpreter.(Sir Nevile Henderson and Sir William Malkin joined the Conference later in the day.)[18028] f
This meeting lasted till about 3 p.m., when an adjournment was arranged. It began by a brief statement by Herr Hitler thanking those present for their acceptances of his invitation and pointing out the need for speedy decisions. Mr. Chamberlain replied suitably, as did M. Daladier and Signor Mussolini. Towards the close of his remarks Signor Mussolini said that he thought the best way of making progress was for someone to produce a basis for discussion, and he therefore read the Memorandum attached. (Appendix A.) It was evident that this document was a reasonable re-statement of much that had been discussed in the Anglo-French and the Anglo-German conversations, and the Prime Minister was ready to accept it as a basis of discussion by the Conference.It was, however, the turn of M. Daladier to speak first, and to our relief he at once said he was prepared to adopt Signor Mussolini&apos;s document as a basis for discussion.   This was agreed.It then being proposed to take the memorandum clause by clause, the Prime Minister said he was willing to accept Clause 1, but he wanted to discuss carefully Clause 2. This clause proposed that we should guarantee that the Czechoslovak Government should complete evacuation by the 10th October, &quot; without existing installations having been destroyed.&quot; The Prime Minister pointed out that he could not give such a guarantee for a number of reasons, one being that there had been no opportunity to ascertain how far, if at all, the Czech Government were or would be disposed to consent. This led to a tirade from Herr Hitler (who was otherwise calm throughout most of the Conference), his line being that if  having asked him to stay his hand -we were not prepared to take the responsibility of ensuring the concurrence of Czechoslovakia we had better let him resume his way! He was, in due course, soothed, and there then followed an effort, lasting for more than half an hour, to explain that whatever others might feel we regarded the word &quot;guarantee&quot; as meaning a good deal.In the course of this discussion the Prime Minister raised the question of the representation at the Conference of the Czech Government. The conclusion was reached that the heads of the four Powers must accept responsibility for deciding -in the circumstances how the situation should be dealt with.Eventually we adjourned to reduce to written words what we meant, -and we produced a revised edition of this memorandum (Appendix B) containing a preamble (to introduce general responsibility) and an amended Clause 2 to show that the Czechs in turn would be held responsible.Then followed the first of what proved to be a long series of to-ings and f ro-ings to the other three delegations, first to explain to them what it meant and then to persuade them to agree.Thereafter at 3-15 followed an interval for lunch at our hotel and for reflection, with orders to be back at 4-30! We arranged with the French delegation to come to us at 3-45, but they failed us. During lunch we drafted a list of points to be settled.[In the meantime arrangements had been made for the Czech Minister at Berlin (M. Mastny) and M. Krofta&apos;s private secretary (M. Masarik) (who had flown from Prague) to be available at the hotel in the evening. It proved to be impossible for me to see them until 10 p.m. (after a late meal during the evening adjournment for dinner), and I then explained to them the position as it had so far developed, giving them a copy of the map showing the proposed stages of occupation.]On &quot;resuming the Conference at 4-30 the Prime Minister endeavoured to secure progress by concentrating upon the two immediate questions what was to be the area to be occupied on the 1st October and what was the extent of the area to be occupied by the 10th October, i.e., up to what line \ Thanks, however, to an intervention by M. Daladier, the discussion wandered to and fro over Clauses 3 and 4 of-this memorandum and over a number of other matters, and it was not until nearly 7 o&apos;clock that we heard what were the German proposals for evacuation and occupation.During this time the Italians produced a minorities draft (Appendix C) which we could not accept, as it seemed to imply, by the use of the words &quot;the same principles,&quot; that we were agreeing to the display of force for the transfer to Poland and to Hungary of the &apos;&apos; Polish &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; Magyar &apos;&apos; areas. We prepared a new draft (Appendix D) and secured its acceptance.The German proposals for evacuation and occupation surprised us by their moderation and by the degree of latitude which they left to the International
Commission. They were explained in detail by Herr Hitler by reference to a map, copies of which we were given.The next hour was spent in a prolonged argument between the French and German Delegations about the Brun &quot;neck&quot; and the fortifications south of Glatz. Eventually the two Delegations agreed upon a form of words which was subsequently embodied in the last part of Article 6 of the main Agreement.After a short adjournment for dinner, agreement was reached upon the evacuation areas and upon the time-table.We inserted in the preamble words to show that the Conference had been working in the light of the fact that it had already been agreed in principle that the Sudeten German areas should be ceded. We also secured the opting clause (Article 7).Meanwhile a Drafting Committee had been set up (Sir William Malkin representing us) and though they had no time for a proper revision, in due course they produced a less untidy document.The French Delegation then produced an &quot;individual and collective &quot; guarantee proposal which we felt unable to accept (no copy available). This Was eventually abandoned in favour of one prepared by Sir William Malkin. This draft, with a minor amendment, was accepted by Count Ciano (who proved helpful) and by Signor Mussolini and was then agreed to by Herr.Hitler. It emerged as shown in the first annex to the Agreement.Earlier in the Conference, when Article 2 was under discussion, we had suggested that any damage done to &apos;w installations &apos;&apos; could be deducted from compensation due from Germany to Czechoslovakia, for State property, loans, &amp;c. This led to an outburst from Herr Hitler who repeated the statements he made at Godesberg as to this property (so far as it is new) being built out of the proceeds of the additional taxation levied upon Sudeten Germans during the last twenty years. He denied that any compensation was due to Czechoslovakia. During dinner we had prepared and sent into the Drafting Committee a short clause (ho copy available) providing that financial and currency questions arising out of the transfer of the territory should be referred for settlement to a German-Czech Commission with a neutral Chairman. On returning to the Fiihrer House I learnt that this was unacceptable to the Germans (Herr von Ribbentrop in evidence) and that all that Sir William Malkin had been able to arrange was that the draft clause should come up to the Conference as a separate paper. When the draft Agreement came before the Conference this clause was absent. (On enquiry I was told (a) that it was not agreed and (b) that the draft we had sent in had been lost.)We took a stand on this, pointing out that there must be a number of questions property, currency, outstanding loans, &amp;c. of the kind contemplated by the draft clause.Eventually a way out was found by a clause (the Supplementary Declaration) providing that all questions arising out of the transfer shall be considered as coming within the terms of reference to the International Commission.After very long delays due to inefficient organisation and lack of control, the Agreement and supplementaries were signed a little before 2:4M. on the-30th September, and the proceedings concluded by brief expressions of satisfaction. &apos; .During the many tedious waits the Prime Minister had some useful conversations with Mussolini and with Count Ciano. jThen arose the question, what to do about the Czechs % It was agreed that each Government should transmit the Agreement to the Czech Government. The French and ourselves, however, had a special interest. M. Daladier declined a suggestion that he should take the Agreement to Prague. It was decided that he and the Prime Minister should together see the Czech representative (who had meantime been waiting at our hotel), and accordingly a meeting took place in the Prime Minister&apos;s room about 2-15. I gave M. Daladier the prepared copy (with map) so that he might hand it to M. Mastny. M. Mastny read, it and asked a number of questions. He was given a pretty broad hint that-having regard to the seriousness of the alternative the best course was for his Government to accept what was clearly a considerable improvement upon the German Memorandum. He and his colleagues said they would fly to Prague and at once place the documents before their Government. We agreed with the French the [18028] F 2
instructions to go to our respective Ministers at Prague. We sent Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin to Prague with the two Czechs so that he could both carry the instructions to Mr. Newton and add the necessary background. He was also to enquire about the international forces.It interested us to note that at no time during the Conference did the German representatives raise the question of Czech foreign policy, nor was Russia mentioned.H. J.

Appendix C to 6.The heads of the Governments of the four Powers declare that the same principles which have permitted the solution of the problem of the Sudeten Germans should be adopted also for the analogous problems of the Polish and Magyar minorities within a maximum delay of one month and according to a procedure which could be eventually fixed through the usual diplomatic channels or by means of another meeting of the heads of the Governments of the four Powers here present.Appendix D to 6.The heads of the Governments of the four Powers declare that the problems of the Polish and Hungarian minorities, if not settled within three months by agreement between the respective Governments, shall form the subject of another meeting of the heads of the Governments of the four Powers here present.7. Note of a Conversation between the Prime Minister and Herr Hitler, September 30, at the latter&apos;s Flat in Munich.PRIMEMINISTER : He was very pleased at the result of yesterday&apos;s pro-ceedings, and he hoped that Herr Hitler was equally happy.HERR HITLER : He was particularly happy, especially that the hopes of many millions of Germans had now been fulfilled and that the 3^ millions of Sudeten Germans were now going to be once more secure. Their sufferings had indeed been terrible, but now they would be the happiest of all about the result of the conference. In this connection he would like to thank the British Prime Minister once more for his great efforts to bring about a peaceful solution. The most difficult problem of all had now been concluded and his own main task had been happily fulfilled.PRIME MINISTER : He warmly appreciated Herr Hitler&apos;s words, but there was now something he wished to say to him by way of an appeal. He had been told that Herr Hitler intended, if the Czechs accepted the proposals, to treat them very generously. This was what he (the Prime Minister) would have expected from Herr Hitler, but he was obliged to consider the possibility that the Czech Government might be mad enough to refuse the terms and attempt resistance. In such an eventuality he wanted to ask Herr Hitler to make sure that nothing should be done which would diminish the high opinion of him which would be held throughout the world in consequence of yesterday&apos;s proceedings. In particular, he trusted that there would be no bombardment of Prague or killing of women and children by attacks from the air.HERR HITLER : Before answering that specific question, he would like to say something on a point of principle. Years ago he made proposals for the restriction of the use of the air arm. He himself fought in the Great War and has a personal knowledge of what air bombardment means. It had been his inten-tion, if he had to use force, to limit air action to front line zones as a matter of principle, but even if the Czechs were mad enough to reject the terms and he had consequently to take forcible action, he would always try to spare the civilian population and to confine himself to military objectives. He hated the thought of little babies being killed by gas bombs.THE PRIME MINISTER: He thanked Herr Hitler for these assurances and would now turn to another matter.- He wished to report to him a conversa-tion which he had had the previous evening with Signor Mussolini on the subject of Spain. He had suggested to the Duce the possibility that the Four Great Powers might call upon the two sides in Spain to establish an armistice and that they might offer their services in assisting them to arrive at a settlement of their differences. The Duce had said, in reply, that he was tired of Spain. (Here Herr Hitler laughed heartily.)   He had lost 50,000 men there; Franco had time
and again thrown away his opportunities of securing a victory. He, Mussolini, was no longer afraid of Bolshevistic domination. He had never had any territorial aims in Spain, and it was his intention shortly to withdraw a considerable body of Italians. As to the suggestion, the Duce had expressed his intention of thinking it over.  Had the Fuhrer anything to say upon this subject ?HERE, HITLER : First of all he desired to repeat what he had many times said before, that Germany had no territorial ambitions in Spain, and that all these rumours about her desiring to occupy Morocco or any other territory were pure invention. He had only supported Franco against bolshevism, of which they had had experience in Munich. He did not know whether it was true that the danger of communism in Spain was over (here the Prime Minister interjected : &quot; The Duce says so &quot;), and he did not know how it would be possible to induce the two parties to agree to a truce, but he agreed with Mussolini that the end of the Spanish conflict, would be welcome, and he would be delighted to withdraw the few German volunteers who were there as soon as ever the others were willing to do the same. If Spain were to become Communist, he feared that the infection would spread to France, from France to Belgium, from Belgium to Holland, and one did not know where it would stop.THE PRIME MINISTER : He too did not know how a truce could be secured, but he had thought that if the two sides received a call from the Four Great Powers they might well be induced to listen and that, once the truce had. been called, the Powers might be able to help in getting a settlement. However, he only now wished to report to the Fuhrer what had passed between himself and Mussolini on this subject and he hoped that the Fuhrer too would give it his personal attention.&apos; HERR HITLER assented.THE PRIME MINISTER: Whenever they began to talk about future Anglo-German relations, no doubt the Fuhrer would haA^e some requests to make and he would not be surprised if, in turn, the Prime Minister asked something from him. (Here the Fuhrer smiled broadly.) He was oppressed by the.thought of the increasing burden which was being imposed upon all countries by the expenditure upon armaments, which was eating up the capital which ought to be employed on building houses, on better food and on improving the health of the people. Accordingly he had listened with sympathy to Herr Hitler&apos;s views on the restriction of air action, but it seemed to him that the difficulty was in inducing people to believe that agreementS&quot;to abstain from air bombardment would in fact be carried out in practice. They could see to-day both in Spain and China how women and children and civilians were being blown to pieces by aerial bombing, but whenever a protest was made to those responsible for this bombing they replied always that they had been aiming at military objectives and that the civilians had suffered because of their proximity to them.Several efforts had been made in the past to bring about disarmament, but only one of them had been at all effective, namely, that which began as the Washington Treaty and was continued in London, in which the tonnage of warships and the calibre of their guns was limited. Basing his views on this experience, he concluded that the qualitative method of restricting armaments was the one which had the most practical results and, moreover, had the additional advantage that it was more easy to control. It was much more possible to see that a country was not constructing bigger weapons than it had agreed to than it was to make sure that it was not constructing more such weapons.Bombing from the air had now become a highly specialised affair for which machines with specialised devices and instruments had been developed, and it was no longer possible to maintain that it was of no use to abolish the bombing madhine because bombs could still be dropped from civilian machines. It was true that bombs could be dropped from any machine in the air, but to make an effective military use of them it was nowadays necessary to use the highly specialised instrument which had been devised for this purpose. Therefore the abolition of bombing aircraft seemed to him to be the practical thing to agree upon.     v..He knew what the Fuhrer would say in reply to this proposal. . He would say that it would be all very well if he were dealing only Avith him or with France and Italy, but there was Russia and. Russia would not agree.   Nevertheless,
bearing in mind the perfection which had been reached by the modern fighter machine and also the pitch of efficiency to which Herr Hitler had brought his anti-aircraft defences, and bearing also in mind that in future he need no longer regard Czechoslovakia as a starting-off place for Russian aggression, could he not feel that Russia could be left out of account ?HERR HITLER : The situation about air disarmament is just the same as it is in the case of the naval situation. If a single nation refuses to agree, all the others have to follow her example. One sees what has happened in the case of the Naval Treaty. When Japan refused to agree, all the other nations had to give up their restriction. It would be just the same if one tried to abolish bombing aircraft. It could only be accepted if all did the same. He himself had proposed years ago- 1. The abolition of bombing aircraft;2: If &quot; 1 &quot; could not be accepted, the abolition of bombing outside.a zone of15 to 20 kilom. from the front line; and 3. If neither &quot; 1 &quot; nor &quot; 2 &quot; were accepted, the limitation of bombing to azone which could be reached by heavy artillery.He himself was particularly attached to &quot; 1,&quot; which was, in his view, in line with the Geneva Agreement providing for the exemption of non-combatants from the effects of warfare. The development of bombing from the air extends the horrors of war to the non-combatant population and is therefore a barbarism.Modern bombers have a range from 6,000 to 8,000 kilom. Unlike Germany, whose ideology is confined to herself, Russia&apos;s ideology is an article for export.&quot; Poland intervenes geographically between Germany and Russia, but he had no very clear idea of her powers of resistance. The same is the case with Roumania. As to Czechoslovakia, he did not know whether the Czechs had changed their mind, but they had only got to prepare a few landing grounds and it would be possible for Russia to land from 2,000 to 4,000 machines in a space of from two to three hours. One ought not to over-estimate the effectiveness of anti-aircraft defences and devices, especially in the case of Germany, where her vulnerable industrial establishments were so close to the frontier that they, could be destroyed before the anti-aircraft defences had adequate warning to put themselves into operation. To give practical effect to the Prime Ministers suggestion, it would be necessary to effect an all-round international agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER : Then it is understood that Herr Hitler does not exclude the participation of Germany in such an agreement by the nations which, to be universal, would, of course, mean the assent of Russia and in turn of Japan.HERR HITLER : The most universal measure ever taken for the limitation of armaments was the Red Cross agreement when the Powers decided that they would not revert to actions which used to be, at one time, general, such as the killing of prisoners, &amp;c.  It was only possible because the whole world agreed to it.THE PRIME MINISTER : He would now leave this question and turn to another, namely, the relations between Germany and South-Eastern Europe. He had read expressions of German opinion indicating a suspicion that England desired not a military but an economic encirclement of Germany. This was a suspicion which, if entertained, was without foundation. He, however, desired to see an improvement in international trade. Yesterday&apos;s proceedings would certainly ease the political tension, but something more positive was required in the economic sphere and he would particularly like to see a relaxation in the restrictions on international trade which now existed. Had the Fuhrer any suggestions to make on this subject?HERR HITLER: In South-Eastern Europe German relations were economic, but there were no political ties.&apos; These economic relations were quite natural because Germany is a great producer of industrial articles and a large consumer of raw materials and foodstuffs. The Balkan States are the other way round. They produce the primary products and consume industrial articles. The greatest difficulties which Germany had experienced with the United States were because Germany was willing to import raw materials and food from the United States, but the United States could not accept payment in the only form which was possible to Germany, namely; the export of industrial goods, because
the United States was herself an immense producer of these goods and at the time had 12,000,000 unemployed. That was why Germany had been unable to settle her difficulties with the United States.One day, but not now when there was so little time, he would like very much to have a full discussion with the Prime Minister on these economic problems. His own idea -for the reconstruction of world economy was that it should not be on an artificial basis, but that it should be founded on national exchanges between primary producers and producers of industrial goods. International trade could not be permanently improved by artificial means such as tariffs or loans. He wanted a continuous flow of the exchange production of raw materials against industrial products, and that his theory was not wrong was shown by the fact that there was in Germany a considerable internal prosperity, and this was due to the fact that he had organised this exchange on the lines he had indicated.THE PRIME MINISTER: It certainly would be interesting some day to have a talk upon this profoundly important problem, and he would only say now that it seemed to him that there was a considerable difference between the internal conditions in Germany, which were under a strict central control, and the regulation of the relations between different countries where there was no such control. Moreover, he would have thought that, even if Herr Hitler&apos;s theories were not only correct but capable of being put into practice, there would still be required loans to facilitate this flow into the two directions mentioned by Herr Hitler.Now, he would not keep Herr Hitler any longer, but he wished to say that he thought it would be a pity if this meeting passed off with nothing more than the settlement of the Czech question, which had been agreed upon yesterday. What he had in mind was to suggest to Herr Hitler that it would! be helpful to both countries and to the world in general if they could issue some statement which showed the agreement between them on the desirability of better Anglo-German relations, leading to a greater European stability. Accordingly, he had ventured to draft a short statement which he w^ould now ask Herr Hitler to read! and to consider whether he would be disposed to issue such a statement over the signatures of himself and the Prime Minister to the public. As these observations were translated to Herr Hitler he ejaculated at intervals &quot; Ja ! Ja ! &quot; and when it was finished he said! he would certainly agree to sign this document. When did the Prime Minister wish to do so %THE PRIME MINISTER: Immediately.HERR HITLER : Then let us sign.At this point, they both rose, went to a writing table and, without any further words, appended their signatures to the document (copy attached as Appendix), of which the Prime Minister handed Herr Hitler one copy to keep and retained! the other.Appendix to 7.We, the German Fuhrer and Chancellor and the British Prime Minister, have had a further meeting to-day and are agreed in recognising that the question of Anglo-German relations is of the first importance for the two countries and for Europe.We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.We are resolved that the method of consultation shall be the method adopted to deal with any other questions that may concern our two countries, and we are determined to continue our efforts to remove possible sources of difference and. thus to contribute to assure the peace of Europe.(Signed) A. HITLER.(Signed) NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.September 30, 1938.
