Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   September 1938.Copy No. 119COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.EVACUATION OF THE CIVIL POPULATION IN TIME. OF WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department.I SHOULD be glad to have the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence for the measures which I propose to take, in connection with the impending publication of the Report of the Committee on Evacuation.2. Under the provisions of the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1937, evacuation is a matter for the Government, and the responsibility of the local authorities is con-fined to supplying information to the Government and carrying out such directions in the matter as the Government may give. To assist me in formulating plans in this difficult subject I appointed in May last a Committee of four M.P.S under the chairmanship of Sir John Anderson. The Committee submitted its Report in July. The Report was formally presented to Parliament before the House rose, and I stated in answer to a Question that, although there were major points of policy which would require Government decisions, the necessary preliminary work and organisation would be set in train without delay.3. The Report must now be published at the earliest convenient opportunity, and there should, be at the same time.a statement of the Government&apos;s policy on the question of principle raised in the Committee&apos;s recommendations. The Com-mittee stress the urgency of preparing detailed plans, but express the opinion that it would be unreasonable and might involve much waste of effort if that stage in the work were entered upon before matters of policy which the Government alone can decide were determined.4. The basic conclusion reached by the Committee is that it is desirable that facilities should be afforded for those who can be spared ,to leave densely populated industrial areas in time of war, and that arrangements should be made for them to be accommodated in safer parts of the country. The Committee point out that there would, in any event, be an exodus on a scale which cannot be-foreseen from any area which had been subjected to repeated air attack; and that, on grounds of humanity and to relieve the situation in congested industrial areas, the movement of non-essential persons from these areas should be facilitated. I do not think that the Committee&apos;s conclusions in these matters can be seriously questioned.5. The Committee emphasises the point that a wholesale evacuation of the main industrial centres in this country would cripple the nation&apos;s war effort, and that there must be clear guidance from the Government who should stay and who may go. The Committee hint that the compilation of a national register in time of peace would greatly assist in this regard. They assume one-third as the proportion of the population for whose evacuation from vulnerable areas provision might ultimately be required. [17877]SECRET. 298-A.f
6. Within this general framework, the detailed recommendations made by the Committee may be summarised as follows :- (a) Schemes  should be prepared on  a basis of voluntary evacuation.Compulsory wholesale evacuation would only arise in limited areas liable to intensive bombardment (e.g., the neighbourhood of docks) or for some other reasons (e.g., flooding) rendered uninhabitable.(b) Plans&quot; should be drawn up on broad lines designed&apos; to make the fullestpractical use of the facilities (transport, housing, feeding, &amp;c.) available. Within the limits of a plan, evacuation could then be carried out in time of emergency to whatever extent was decided upon by the authorities. j(c) In the areas used for the reception of refugees, they should be housed in private dwellings under a scheme of billeting, for which compulsory powers would have to be taken.(d) In the expectation that there will eventually be a substantial measureof support for the idea, plans should be prepared in complete detail for the transference of children of school age, school by school, in time of war, from vulnerable areas to places of greater safety. No child should be removed without the consent of its parents and steps should be taken to inform parents in time of peace of the detailed plans proposed and to ascertain their reactions.(e) Steps should be taken without delay to set up the necessary central and local organisation for working out schemes of evacuation. (/) The Government should bear the whole cost of schemes for the evacua-tion of school children. In the case of other members of the com-munity the first charge for subsistence allowances to&apos; refugees, pay-ments to persons supplying accommodation, &amp;c, should be upon the Government, but those who are evacuated would be expected to make a contribution towards their maintenance, according to their means.7. The Committee stress the point that schemes, if they are to succeed, must have the backing of the overwhelming mass of public opinion. This is, perhaps, particularly true of the proposal that school children should be removed separately from other members of the community. It is impossible to know what the view of parents will be until considerable information can be given to them as to the arrangements to be made for the children. //I propose therefore that plans should at once be worked out relating to school children in order that the parents may be assisted to an informed opinion on the subject.8. I suggest that we should announce our acceptance of the main lines of the recommendations made in the Report. There will be points, e.g., the allotment of reception areas to the various industrial centres, on which we may wish to modify the Committee&apos;s plans, but none of these points are fundamental. The proposal that evacuation should be voluntary in character is in accord with our traditions, and my advisers, including the Commissioner of Police, take the view that compulsory evacuation on an appreciable scale could not be enforced. Compulsory billeting, intended for the housing of millions Of refugees, will raise social difficulties of some complexity; but it is clearly impracticable to organise the reception of vast masses of persons on any other basis, and it should be noted that only accommodation, and not services, is being requisitioned. The financial burden must rest upon the Government in the first instance, though we should, as the Committee proposes, attempt to obtain contributions from those who can afford to pay wholly or partly for their maintenance.9. I have strengthened the staff of the Air Raid Precautions Department to enable it to deal with this additional work, and I have been in touch with the authorities concerned to ascertain what organisation should be provided in London and in the wide area which refugees from London will cover to provide for the transport, reception, accommodation and feeding of refugees. The organisation best suited for London should be applicable elsewhere without substantial modification.
10.   I accordingly seek approval for (a) the acceptance in principle of the recommendations of the Committee onEvacuation, and(b) the announcement of this acceptance, when the report is published, withparticular reference to the proposals that evacuation should in general be voluntary, that billeting in the reception areas should be on a compulsory basts, that the Government should bear the first charge of evacuation arrangements, and that refugees who can afford to con-tribute towards their maintenance should be required to do so.S.

)COMMITTEE ON EVACUATIONREPORTTo Lieutenant-Colonel The Right Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, Bt., G.C.S.I., G.B.E., C.M.G., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department.Sir,We were appointed by you on the 24th May, 1938, and the scope of our task was indicated in your answer to a question in the House of Commons on the 26th May, as follows:  Various aspects of the problem of transferring persons from areas which are likely to be exposed to continuous air attack, including the plans said to be in contemplation in other countries, have been examined by the Home Office. With the purpose of bringing the subject under full review, I have invited the Right Hon. Member for the Scottish Universities (Sir John Anderson) and the Hon. Members for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir Percy Harris), Balham and Tooting (Lieutenant-Colonel George Doland) and North Islington (Dr. Haden Guest) to serve on a Committee which will assist me in the preparation of plans. While this Com-mittee will, no doubt, begin its work on the problem of London, it will have in mind the application of its plans to other big centres of population &quot;.2. We have held 25 meetings and examined 57 witnesses.   A list of these witnesses and of the organised bodies which have sent witnesses or submitted written representations is given in I Appendix A.3. We have completed a review of the problem in all its i aspects and consider that we are now in a position to report upon I the general principles on which detailed plans for evacuation should be based. The task appears to us to be one of great urgency. The preparation of plans will clearly involve a mass I of work, to be undertaken by a great many authorities and il voluntary organisations. The completion of such plans in detail 1 need not take long, but it would be unreasonable and might in-P volve much waste of effort if that stage in the work were entered I upon before matters of policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government I alone can decide were determined.
4. In the time at our disposal it has not been possible to give detailed consideration to the special aspects which the problem may present in particular industrial areas. We have, therefore, given special attention to the question of evacuation in relation to (( London ^jvhich presents special difficulties because of its ,size and the density of population in certain areas. We believe that the course to be followed in working out plans for London will prove to be readily adaptable to other places where schemes of evacuation should be prepared.
CHAPTER I. General Survey.Introduction.5. We propose first to indicate the nature and proportions of the problem as we see it; and to present certain general con-r elusions at which we have arrived.6. In any future war in which Great Britain is at conflict with a great European power, air invasion would take place on a very much greater scale than the air raids on London and other cities during the war of 1914-18. Large numbers of planes would be directed against docks, public utility undertakings, important factories and recognised military objectives.7. Whether or not the civilian population were deliberately attacked, people living in industrial areas would be exposed to great dangers, especially those living in the immediate neigh-bourhood of important targets. Inner London contains many such objectives of attack and is, therefore, particularly vulner-able; and in different degrees the same is true of industrial areas such as Birmingham, Coventry, Derby, Liverpool, Man-chester, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle and Glasgow. Other places, for example the naval ports, might be exposed to special risks because of the existence of military objectives in the neigh-bourhood.8. Practical considerations, such as the number of aeroplanes available and the distance of possible objectives, are likely to restrict the number of places chosen for attack. Vast tracts of the country cannot be attacked simultaneously, and important places in the central and eastern parts of Great Britain are likely to bear the brunt of the first attacks.9. But if we turn from London and the industrial areas to the counties, with their small towns, villages, and rural areas, the likelihood of attack becomes very much less and the degree of safety correspondingly greater. No part of the country is likely in the future to be safe from attack in the sense that it will be out of range, but in many places the risk will not be substantially greater than that bombs might be dropped in error or to relieve an aeroplane of its cargo when it had missed its objective.10. Even in the industrial areas, there are great differences as between one part of the area and another. Some parts may be highly dangerous, others much less dangerous and some perhaps hardly dangerous at all.11945 A 2
Voluntary Exodus.ii. Whatever the Governments plans, it is to be anticipated that there would be an exodus, on a scale which cannot accurately be foreseen, from any- area which had been sub-jected to repeated air attack. Men and women engaged on work of an essential character would in the great majority of cases be moved by a sense of public duty to remain at their tasks, and the Government of the day may be expected to exhort them to do so, as their contribution to the national effort. The tendency to migrate would accordingly be found more especially among those whose presence could be spared. We have assumed that the Government would not normally attempt forcibly to restrain persons from leaving a vulnerable area. If large numbers of persons are determined to leave a district, it does not seem to be practicable, even if it were desirable, to prevent them from doing so.12. We have also assumed that as a general rule compulsion would not be exercised to require persons to leave a vulnerable area if they desired to stay. Limited areas in London and else-where might have to be completely evacuated for military reasons or on such grounds as the risk of flooding, but apart from these special cases we do not believe that public opinion would accept any scheme for the compulsory transfer from their homes of vast numbers of town dwellers.13. Without attempting to resort to methods of compulsion, the Government could, however, exercise a substantial measure of control over any movement of population. In the first place, if it has taken steps in advance to secure the necessary data, it can advise who should go and who should stay. We believe that the public spirit of the people of this country is such that in a time of grave national emergency they would be entirely responsive to guidance of this kind from the Government. If the advice were given in clear and precise terms, it would have a powerful effect in securing an ordered evacuation. A second respect in which the Government can influence any movement of the population is by the use made of the organised facilities at its disposal. Panic will be allayed if it is known that the Government has worked out plans and is ready to put them into operation; and the character of any large-scale exodus from the towns will be moulded by the arrangements made for employing the available transport and other facilities.14. Accordingly, in the examination we have made of the case for and against evacuation, we have had in mind, not any. attempt to regiment the population, but the direction in which the influence of the Government and the resources at its disposal should be employed.
Need for Active and Passive Defence.15. A very high proportion of the essential activities of the country is carried on in areas which might be exposed to severe aerial bombardment. This is notably the case in London. The vital place of the Capital in finance, commerce and government needs no elaboration. As regards industry, Greater London contains one in five of the insured workers of this country, and we were informed by the Ministry of Labour that 62 per cent, of the London workers are engaged in industry groups which would be particularly important in war-time for production, commerce and government.16. The cessation in time of war of industrial and other essential activities in London and the main centres of population would cripple the nation &apos;s war efforts and paralyse the life of the community by the failure to supply essential civilian needs. For these reasons the evacuation of the entire population from the larger towns, even if practicable, would be a disastrous step, not to be contemplated for a moment.17. Plans for evacuation are accordingly no substitute for measures of active and passive defence designed to enable production to be maintained in the large industrial towns throughout the country. The recommendations we make do not in any way detract&apos; from the urgent need for adequate active defences in the air and on the ground, and for proper shelter accommodation and other measures of air raid precautions to protect and succour those who will be expected to continue to live and work in vulnerable areas.Scope of Transference.18. It is, nevertheless, clear that a proportion of the popula-tion of industrial areas could be transferred from them without serious detriment to national efficiency.19. At our request, the Ministry of Labour made a general survey of the situation in London. Clearly children under 14 years of age and unoccupied and retired persons could go. A percentage of the employed population, composed of varying proportions in the different industries, could also be spared; and -while many housewives would remain to provide for the needs of the working population, a considerable proportion of the women in London need not stay.It is difficult to estimate the proportion of the total population of London which could be evacuated without serious loss to essential activities. The Ministry of Labour thought the pro-portion might be as high as a half; but they admitted that this estimate was very speculative.   In the absence of a detailed&quot;945 A 3
investigation, we should prefer not to commit ourselves to any definite figure, beyond saying that it would be substantial and would represent a very large number of persons in the aggregate.20. Substantial proportions of the population could be spared from other industrial areas, though the numbers would of course vary according to the extent to which essential industries were centred in an area.21. In the case of finance and commerce rather different con-siderations enter. We have been informed that plans are under consideration by the interests concerned for the removal from London in time of war of essential financial and commercial activities, where a transfer to safer areas is practicable. This matter is not within our reference, but is obviously of great importance, and will affect the numbers of people who should be evacuated, as also will any decentralisation of Governmental activities and the calls likely to be made on the civilian popula-tion for war service of various kinds.22. As a rough working hypothesis we have taken one-third as the proportion of the population for whose evacuation from vulnerable areas provision might ultimately be required.23. At this point we should explain that when we use the term &quot; evacuation &quot; we mean transference beyond the limits of the urban area concerned. We employ the term &quot; dispersal &quot; to denote redistribution within the same urban area.Difficulties of Evacuation.24. The transference of large numbers of people from their homes and accustomed surroundings to other and often un-familiar areas is not a task to be undertaken lightly. It raises problems of great complexity and difficulty at every stage, whether it be the collection and transportation of the refugees or their reception, accommodation and feeding at the other end. All the services which are delicately adjusted to meet the needs of the community on the present distribution of the population would have to be refashioned to deal with the new situation. Both in the areas from which persons are drawn and in the country districts to which they are taken, social problems and questions of public order of great complexity would be bound to arise. In time of peace such movement of the population would present difficulties of great magnitude. In war, there will be the added complications that the transfer will coincide with the dislocation inseparable from the transition from peace.to -war, and that it may have to be carried out after hostile air attack has begun and under conditions of considerable disorganisation.
Arguments for Evacuation.25. In spite of these difficulties we are convinced that the contingency is one against which the fullest possible provision must be made. It is a matter on which the whole issue of any future war may well turn. So far as concerns actual physical danger, people will be much safer in rural districts or in small country towns than in the heart of London. Even if a country district is bombed, the risks to life and limb will obviously be much less in a rural district where the houses are so dispersed that the density of population is 200 to the square mile, than in a metropolitan borough where the density is 80,000 to the square mile. A thinning of the population of congested urban areas will automatically reduce the number of casualties in the event of raids. It will also relieve the pressure on the essential services (including air raid precautions) in these areas. Unless enormous numbers were enrolled and vast stocks of equipment bought it is doubtful whether these services would ever be adequate to deal, with the situation which might be created in, say, the East End of London if it were continuously bombed and retained its full peace-time population. Nor might it be possible in the dis-location which would ensue to feed the population or supply the various essential services.26. Apart from the danger to life and limb, there are obviously strong objections on humanitarian grounds to the retention, in areas which are likely to be the object of deliberate attack, of persons whose presence is not absolutely essential. It is im-possible fully to envisage the horrors of intensive air attack by the forces of a major European power on a densely populated city; but events in Spain and China have at least given some indication of what might befall. No one would willingly expose children, the aged or infirm, or anyone whose presence could be dispensed with to the nervous strain entailed.27. There is another vitally important consideration. If the public know in advance that adequate plans of evacuation are ready to be put into force wherever circumstances require, the risk of large uncontrolled movements, resulting in widespread loss of morale and lowering of war efficiency, will be reduced to a minimum.28. It must remain a matter for conjecture whether air raids will be concentrated on certain specific targets, such as a dock area. If they are so directed, it may be necessary to arrange a compulsory evacuation of any residential area in the immediate vicinity. Workers housed in that area would have to be accommodated at a reasonable distance from their place of work, and if adequate shelters were provided it might be practicable after a period for them to return to their homes, or to other accommodation specially prepared at or near their place of work. 11945 A 4
29. On a careful review of the considerations set out above, we have reached the conclusion that this country will not be fully prepared for attack from a hostile power with a strong air force until schemes of evacuation covering the main industrial centres in the country have been worked out and the necessary organisa-tion has been set up to enable such schemes to be brought speedily into operation in time of emergency.Form of Plans for Evacuation.30. The ideal scheme would be one under which the Govern-ment would be in a position to determine with some degree of precision either in advance or on the occurrence of the emer-gency, which individuals should remain where they are and who should be exhorted to leave. Such a scheme, however, would seem to presuppose the existence of a plan to enable the authorities to assign to each individual his role in time of war. To discuss the full implications of such a plan would carry us far beyond our reference. We must content ourselves with pointing out that any effective step in this direction--for example, the compilation of a national register would be likely to contribute to the smooth and efficient working of any plan of evacuation.31. There are certain steps, however, independent of any elaborate organisation of national service, which can, and in our opinion should, be taken at once. These steps, which we - discuss in detail in a later chapter, comprise the organisation of transport services from industrial areas, the elaboration of plans for the reception of refugees in relatively safe areas and provision for their housing, feeding, and general welfare.32. We have indicated above that, except possibly in certain limited areas of high risk, we consider that evacuation should be on a voluntary basis. A proportion of the population will wish to go by their own transport to destinations of their own selection in the country. We see no reason why this movement should be restrained in any way, though it will require a great deal of careful organisation as a road traffic problem. We under-stand that in London the Commissioner of Police has already had this matter under consideration, in consultation with the London Passenger Transport Board.33. As regards those who may wish to avail themselves of the facilities afforded by the Government, it will be difficult to obtain any precise information in advance of the event, except in special cases such as school children with which we deal in detail later. Even as regards probable numbers, it may not prove to be practicable to do more than make tentative inquiries to form an estimate of the proportion of the population who would wish to go. It has also to be borne in mind that when war comes, intentions formed in peace may be drastically modified.
, 34- A further factor of uncertainty in the preparation of plans, to which many of those with whom we discussed those problems drew attention, is the timing of evacuation. If evacuation can be carried out before there are air attacks, the process will be far more speedy and far less difficult than if it is delayed until war has begun. It was, however, impressed upon us that any Government would be loath to put into force plans for evacuation until it was persuaded that all hopes of maintaining peace had gone and that there might well be little or no margin of time between that stage and the outbreak of hostilities. We recognise the force of these observations; and we believe that if there is war the probability is that it will have broken out before any large-scale scheme of evacuation has been put into full operation. Accordingly any plans which are prepared must be capable of execution under conditions of air attack, though no doubt at a slower rate than would be possible at an earlier stage. At the same time we would stress the importance of bringing the plans into operation at the earliest practicable moment, at all events so far as the school children are concerned.35. Until a complete survey of available accommodation in the safer areas has been made, it will be impossible to determine the scale on which evacuation can be carried out without overtaxing the resources of the country. We believe that accommodation will in fact prove to be. the limiting factor, in the sense that there will not be room in the relatively safe areas for all who could theoretically be spared from the vulnerable industrial areas. Our enquiries, however, justify the expectation that, except in Scot-land, the limit will be found to be well in excess of the proportion of one-third, which, as indicated in paragraph 22, we have taken as a working hypothesis on which to base the numbers to be catered for.36. The plans to be drawn up should be on broad lines, de-signed to make the fullest practicable use of the facilities avail-able. Within the limits of the plan, evacuation can then be carried out in time of emergency to whatever extent is decided upon by the authorities when war comes or is imminent.37. It would be difficult to determine in advance the exact pace at which, within the limits of available facilities, evacuation is carried out. So far as the wishes of individuals are con-cerned, the efflux of refugees would probably be in waves and some allowance for this tendency, the exact extent of which cannot be foreseen, would have to be made in any scheme.It would also be useful to classify areas within a vulnerable zone in the order of priority in which organised evacuation should take place from them. Facilities might be provided at the outset of hostilities for some of these areas to be thinned of&quot;945 A 5
IOtheir population, while the execution of plans in respect of others might be delayed until the nature and extent of the air attack directed against this country was known.In any event the initial stages would be bound to be difficult and we believe that some curtailment of the movement of persons into vulnerable areas such as might be achieved by the declaration of Bank Holidays in the first days of the war  would be of great value and would assist the outward movement of refugees.38. The results of our examination of the transport, reception, accommodation, feeding and welfare aspects of the evacuation problem, more particularly in their application to London, are outlined in the chapters which follow; and the recommendations which we make above are based on these detailed investigations.
CHAPTER II. Detailed Aspects.Transport Facilities.39. We discussed with representatives of the main line rail-way companies and of the London Passenger Transport Board the facilities which would be available for transporting persons from London to places of greater safety. As a rough basis on which to work, we suggested to the railway companies that they should assume that refugees in the first instance would be taken on an average 50 miles from the centre of London.40. It is clear that an exodus on the scale which is con-templated should be based primarily upon the railway system which has a carrying capacity far beyond that of motor road transport.41. The general character of the arrangements proposed by the companies was that road transport and the underground rail-ways should be used to feed the main line railways at selected entraining centres. It was thought to be undesirable to make the transfer from the underground railways to the main lines in vulnerable areas, especially where the London Passenger Trans-port Board tube system, is still in tunnel. The companies pro-posed that transfer from the London Passenger Transport Board system to the main lines should be at certain places on the out-skirts of London. In a few cases the Board&apos;s station is at some distance from the main line railway station, and it would be desirable to provide a certain number of buses to facilitate the exchange, especially in the case of the young, the infirm and the aged.42. It would probably be desirable to use a considerable pro-portion of the L.P.T.B. omnibuses on skeleton services in Central London, which would assist in taking members of the public from their homes to underground railway stations. There are also a number of districts which are not served by tube or district railways where bus services would have to serve as feeders to the main line railway stations.43. It was also proposed that in the case of one or two main line stations situated in congested areas, collection should be direct to these stations.44. Under a scheme on the lines indicated above, the main line railway companies and the London Passenger Transport Board have calculated that, with their combined resources, they could remove 100,000 persons per hour from London. The London Passenger Transport Board would probably have some
surplus capacity over this figure; and, if desired, this excess capacity could be used to take refugees to areas on the fringe of London.45. The figure of 100,000 persons per hour would fully occupy the sections of the line over which the trains would run and would leave no surplus capacity for any suburban or main line services and would exclude goods traffic entirely, including the transport of highly perishable goods. In the event of these services having to be provided in some measure, while evacua-tion was being effected, the rate of removal of persons from London would be slowed down, but presumably not to any substantial extent.46. The main line railway companies have informed us that the question whether trains were to be operated on a shuttle service to a few relatively large detraining centres, or to a number of stations along each line whereby the refugees would be distributed more nearly to their ultimate destinations, would be a matter of arrangement which would not substantially affect their carrying capacity.47. The figures supplied to us by the companies assume that seats in railway carriages would have to be found for all. This is in order to provide for the minimum of luggage which refugees would have to be allowed to bring with them.48. We recommend that, when the outline of a scheme for an area has been drawn up, the railway companies and other transport agencies concerned should be given the general plan and asked to prepare emergency time tables for the transport services required, which would be held in readiness for immedi-ate operation if the need arose.Reception Arrangements.49. We have not considered in detail the arrangements to be made for the reception of refugees at the detraining points, but we have had various consultations on the general character of the plans which will be required.50. We believe that, in a very large-scale evacuation from London, it would prove to be more convenient to take refugees to relatively large centres, and to organise the necessary arrange-ments from these places for the distribution of refugees in the surrounding districts. .  .To meet the contingency of possible delay in the transference of refugees to their allotted accommodation, it will be desirable to provide for the temporary reception of as many persons as possible in empty houses, halls and other large buildings, and to make arrangements for their feeding. These are details which must be worked out on the spot, according to the circumstances of each locality.
51. The use of camps could not be contemplated as a general rule but there might be cases where the inadequacy of accom-modation of a permanent character would necessitate the pro-vision in advance of temporary hutments at detraining centres.52. We are satisfied that it would be quite practicable to organise in the various country districts the necessary arrange-ments for distributing the refugees from the main line stations to the towns and villages for which they were ultimately destined. This would be a matter of detailed arrangement to be made locally, in which all available transport facilities would be pressed into service. In some cases where the distances were relatively short it would not be unreasonable to ask the refugees to walk the remaining distance, provided that they were given clear directions on the subject.Accommodation.53. Accommodation for large numbers of refugees can only be obtained quickly and economically by billeting in private houses, and we have consulted the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland on the accommodation which would be available if a proportion of the population of the more densely populated parts of the country were evacuated to relatively safe areas.54. The numbers that could be placed in private houses depend on the extent to which it is practicable, having regard to convenience and considerations of decency, to crowd persons into available accommodation. Broadly speaking, there are two recognised standards for peace-time conditions. By the Housing Act, 1935, and the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1935, a statutory minimum standard was laid down, non-compliance with which renders the offender liable to penalties. The Minis-try of Health have assumed, as a rough basis of calculation for our present purposes, that five persons might be accommodated in every four rooms. In the South of England this would be equivalent to doubling the present population.55. In building new houses for slum clearance and in calculat-ing the exchequer subsidy thereon, Parliament has laid down a standard on a quite different basis, which may be regarded as a good standard of occupation for working class houses. This provides roughly that a non-parlour house with three bedrooms should accommodate not more than five persons, or one person per room.56. The tables set out in Appendix B to this report show the accommodation available in the various counties in England and Wales and in Scotland on the standards indicated in para-graphs 54 and 55.  From these counties certain industrial areas
were excluded at our suggestion on the ground that they might be the*subject of evacuation schemes or that they were not safe enough for the reception of refugees.Overcrowding is a serious problem in the North of England and still more serious in Scotland; and it will be a matter of some difficulty to find enough accommodation in Scotland for an evacuation on a substantial scale from the larger cities.The maps given in Appendix C show how the country might be divided up to provide accommodation for one-third of the population from certain specified industrial centres.57. As indicated in paragraph 35, we have reached the con-clusion, on an examination of the information supplied by the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland, that the problem of accommodation provides the limiting factor to the scale on which facilities for evacuation can be provided. It is reasonably clear that in London, and probably in other centres, transport facilities can be provided to meet the needs of any orderly scheme of evacuation, but there is a definite limit on the extent to which billets can be found.58. We should have liked to recommend that billeting, in any evacuation scheme, should be on the slum clearance standard, but we are satisfied that this would not provide sufficient accom-modation, especially in the North of England and in scotland . It will accordingly be necessary to make preparations on the basis that private houses in the safer areas may have to be filled up to the standard laid down in the Housing Acts, 1935; and in Scotland even that low standard may have to be exceeded.59. We recommend that, as a first step in the detailed exami-nation of the evacuation problem, local authorities should be directed to make returns to the Home Office of the billeting accommodation available in relatively safe areas on the two standards given in paragraphs 54 and 55.60. It will be necessary to give the authorities the power in time of war to requisition accommodation for the billeting of refugees; and we need hardly, say that any compulsory billeting would have to be enforced without regard to class or other dis-tinctions. If the reception of refugees were worked out on a purely voluntary basis those receiving them would expect to be allowed to impose conditions regarding the type of refugee which they would accept and the circumstances and length of time for which they would take them. Moreover, it would be a matter of the greatest difficulty to keep a register up to date, and when the emergency arose people might change their minds and refuse to carry out their agreement. It appears to us&apos; to be quite impracticable to organise the reception of vast masses of persons on so uncertain a basis.
6i. At the same time, it would be unfortunate if the very real advantage of voluntary arrangements were to be lost. In the particular case of school children, there would be great practical advantages in securing, so far as possible, their reception in households which had expressed a willingness to receive them. The evidence we have had encourages us to believe that accom-modation for the full number of school children might be found on this basis. Householders volunteering to receive school children would, of course, be expected to receive them to the full limit of their capacity but they would have the assurance that they would not also be required to receive adults. In setting apart accommodation for school children a substantial margin will have to be allowed in respect of the probable addition to the normal population of the receiv-ing areas of persons seeking refuge with friends and relatives.62. It does not appear to be practicable to rely at the outset to any large extent on the use of camps for the permanent accommodation of evacuated persons. The capacity of existing camps of a permanent or semi-permanent character is very limited, and temporary camps (apart from the time occupied in their erection) involve questions of feeding, water supply, and sanitation which militate against their use on any extensive scale.At the same time, full use would no doubt be made of existing camps and of any that may be erected in the future for peace-time purposes; and it might be necessary in certain districts to erect and use hutments at a later stage in schemes of evacuation to relieve any severe pressure on accommodation.63. No matter how well a large-scale evacuation may be organised, considerable unevenness in the distribution of refugees in the available accommodation is inevitable; and in the North of England and in Scotland the overcrowding in all areas is already so serious that an influx of refugees into the safer parts may well create conditions which are only tolerable for a short period. We envisage, however, the possibility of a second stage in evacuation plans, when refugees who had been taken quickly to areas conveniently situated for the immediate evacuation of danger zones would be distributed over more distant areas where more accommodation was available.Food.64. The report of the Food (Defence Plans) Department for the year 1937 outlines the general plans in contemplation for the supply, control and distribution of food-stuffs in time of war.65. Arrangements have been made for the setting-up of local food control committees within the area of each local authority and it is intended that each committee should select a local food executive officer as its chief official.
66. The local food control committees will be responsible for-        (a) the registration of all consumers in their areas; o   (&amp;) the licensing and registration of retail traders in essential food-stuffs; and(c) the issue of rationing documents to consumers in their areas, if it were decided to ration consumers.67. We discussed with the Director of the Food (Defence Plans) Department of the Board of Trade the steps which would have to be taken to provide for the feeding of persons trans-ferred from industrial areas under schemes of evacuation, and we are satisfied that, provided that those responsible for working out the arrangements for the supply of food in time of war are given the necessary information and the time in which to com-plete their plans, there are no insuperable obstacles, from the point of view of the supply of food and of feeding, to schemes of evacuation on the scale which we have in mind. The detailed arrangements necessary represent a great deal of work which will have to be undertaken without delay, when the general framework of the evacuation schemes for the country at. large has been settied.68. It would be necessary to issue food for the first few days to the refugees as rations since it would take some little time for the transferred population to be brought within the rationing arrangements in the neighbourhood to which they were taken. The aim would, however, be to encourage refugees to settle down in their new surroundings with a minimum of delay and to link up with a local retailer. It was considered that if arrangements were made to cope with the situation during the first few days of the transference, the food trade could deal with the situation at all later stages.69. When detailed plans are being worked out we presume that those responsible will bear in mind that private householders providing accommodation for refugees could not be compelled to provide services, such as cooking. In many cases services of this kind, or at all events facilities, would no doubt be pro-vided by voluntary arrangements; but large-scale plans for communal feeding will have to be included in the scheme.General Welfare.70. As soon as.the schemes of evacuation have been worked out on a quantitative basis it will be necessary to proceed to make careful plans for safeguarding the health and general welfare of the refugees.71. Our preliminary enquiries satisfy us that in the country districts immediately round London, there would be no serious objection so far as water supplies and sewerage are concerned
to doubling the present population. There may be rural dis-tricts elsewhere where a shortage of water or inadequate sanitary arrangements will make it necessary to limit the number of refugees below the figure which they could otherwise absorb.72. The Health Services in the reception areas will have to be strengthened to deal with the needs of the augmented popu-lation. &quot;73. The arrangements may not serve at the outset to provide more than the bare essentials of existence. But these should never be lacking, albeit on a somewhat meagre scale, and persons who have been moved from places of danger to an area of comparative safety are not likely to be exigent. Nevertheless, it will obviously be of the greatest importance to take all prac-ticable steps to maintain the morale of the population in the reception areas, and it will be necessary to make a special study of ways and means by which this can be done. There may here and there be considerable friction, especially at first, between the inhabitants of these areas and the incomers who are billeted upon them, and who will find themselves in unfamiliar sur-roundings with a minimum of the necessities of life and very little with which to occupy their time. Such a situation will be fruitful of trouble unless special steps are taken to counteract the conse-quences of boredom and discontent. At a later stage conditions more nearly approximating to normal life may be attained, especially if, as may be anticipated, a large proportion of the refugees show a spirit of helpful co-operation.74. In the steps to be taken for the welfare of refugees, there will be great scope for voluntary service, and we are confident that this call will not go unanswered.Evacuated Areas.75. Large-scale movements of the civil population at the outset of the war will take the form of evacuation, as defined in paragraph 23, but thereafter a dispersal of the population within the urban area from which evacuation has taken place may pro-vide a further means of alleviating the situation either by ad-justing inequalities in the distribution of the population after evacuation or by enabling persons whose continued presence in the area for national purposes is essential to find greater safety through dispersal. This would no doubt have to be arranged by a system of compulsory billeting rather similar to that con-templated in the reception areas.76. We do not think it would be practicable to carry the principle of dispersing the population to the point of evacuating essential personnel and making plans to transport them back daily in order that they might carry on their work. The idea may have some limited application in certain areas; but as a general rule we believe that it would entail too great a strain on transport facilities and would not prove to be practicable.
CHAPTER III.School Children.Introduction.77. In our examination of the evacuation problem, we have devoted special attention to the manner in which children in vulnerable areas should be dealt with.78. In January last, the Board of Education and the Scottish Education Department, with the concurrence of the Home Office, issued circulars to local education authorities on the protection of school children in time of air attack. The question whether schools should remain open in time of war was left to the dis-cretion of local education authorities; but an indication was given that in areas where the risk of air attack was great the preferable course was to close the schools during the whole period for which raids might be expected.On the subject of the evacuation of school children from dangerous areas, the circulars went on to say:  &quot; In those areas which are especially exposed to danger the ideal solution would be to evacuate the children not all of whom will be of school age to safer districts, pre-. ferably in the country, where they could be dispersed in private houses or public buildings or possibly in small camps. The difficulties of any such scheme are obvious, but they should not prevent its careful consideration. De-tails would have to be worked out beforehand (and the consent of the parents obtained) as part of the general scheme of Air Raid Precautions for the district, and in co-operation with the authorities for the districts to which the children would be transferred. The Home Office would be prepared to advise authorities, so far as possible, in the preparation of schemes for the purpose.&quot;Local Education Authorities.79. The Air Raid Precautions Act, 1937, was framed on the basis that the initiative for schemes of evacuation rests with the Government, and the responsibility of local authorities is con-fined to making arrangements pursuant to any directions given by the Home Secretary. Local education authorities will, therefore, look to the Government for a definite lead before proceeding with the preparation of detailed plans for removing children from vulnerable areas.80. Following the issue of the circulars, a number of local education authorities have decided to close their schools on the outbreak of war and have expressed views in favour of the evacuation of school children from vulnerable areas.
8i. Thus the London County Council, by a resolution passed on the ioth May last, agreed:  &quot; (a) that the Council approves in principle the policy of a general closure of all its schools in London for a limited period on advice being tendered by the competent authori-ties that air raids are to be expected, and that the ques-tion of re-opening schools in any or all parts of London be considered at short intervals in the light of experience; and that the managers of non-provided schools and the governors of aided schools and institutions be advised to take similar action;(6) that, in the opinion of the Council, any scheme of evacuation of the child population should be dealt with as an integral part of the scheme of transfer of the civil popula-tion; and that the Council expresses its willingness to co-operate with H.M. Government and the Metropolitan Borough Councils in schemes of evacuation;(c) that the Council agrees in principle that, in case of emergency, children in its residential schools deemed to be exposed to danger shall be transferred to the Council &apos;s resi-dential schools deemed to be less exposed and the CounciFs training college students dispersed.&quot;Case for Separate Evacuation of Children.82. We received a substantial volume of evidence in support of the view that plans should be prepared for the evacuation of children of school age from vulnerable areas to places of greater safety. The London County Council were good enough to outline for us a scheme under which 500,000 school children might be removed from the County of London, under the care of their teachers, and billeted in the country districts surround-ing London. The National Union of Teachers, the Educational Institute of Scotland and representatives of the Secondary School Teachers Associations assured us that the Government could count on the full co-operation of school teachers in the working out and execution of any scheme for evacuating school children, and the Secretary of the Association of Education Committees gave us a similar assurance on behalf of the local education authorities.83. There are substantial advantages in favour of a detailed plan for the transfer of school children from danger zones in time of war. If men have to remain in these areas because they are engaged in work of national importance, their wives may wish to stay with them and they will be performing the very necessary task of keeping the home of the menfolk and feeding them. Very young children can hardly be parted from their mothers.
84. The children of school age, on the other hand, are a liability and not an asset from the standpoint of war-time efficiency. There is every reason for removing them frpm the physical dangers and nervous strain of repeated aerial bombard-ment. Instances were quoted to us of children in London during the last war who suffered serious and permanent injury, because of the shock to the nervous system of repeated air raids. While no one can gauge exactly the conditions that will prevail in any future war, we must assume that they will be infinitely worse than in London in the last war.85. The removal and billeting of school children would probably present fewer difficulties, as a problem of organisa-tion, than any scheme covering all the members of the com-munity who could be spared. As we have indicated above, any plans for the transference of masses of the population will have to be very general in character, because it is impossible to define closely the individuals who will participate in the arrange-ments made. With school children, on the other hand, the school can be taken as the unit and plans prepared on the basis that the numbers in attendance at any given school, or a pro-portion thereof, will have to be removed. This gives a precise basis for plans which is lacking in the case of adults. Further, the numbers involved, though very large, are more manageable than the total number of persons who could be spared from any area; and the collection, transport, reception, accommoda-tion and welfare arrangements are correspondingly more easy to arrange. As regards billeting arrangements, the social diffi-culties which may arise in the receiving areas are relatively small in the case of children. A householder in the country will be much more ready to receive some children into his house than a number of adults.Attitude of Parents.86. Those who appeared before us were all agreed that any scheme for the evacuation of school children must be entirely voluntary in character, that is to say the decision whether a child remains at home or is evacuated with other school children must rest with its parents. We are in complete agreement with this view. Whatever the attractions and practicability of a scheme for the transference of school children from dangerous zones, the probable attitude of the parent is, therefore, a most important factor in the situation.87. We had conflicting views on the attitude which parents were likely to adopt. It was represented forcibly to us by some witnesses that in times of severe stress many parents would refuse to be parted from their children, and that accordingly evacua-tion arrangements should be made on a family basis. -It was considered that mothers with children of school age might be
doubtful whether their children would be properly cared for under any evacuation scheme and would take the line that no part of the country was safe from attack. It was also argued that they would be deterred from parting with their children because of a fear that in war news- might not be forthcoming of the safety and well-being of their children. It was also thought that mothers, with children below or above school age as well as children of school age, might be unwilling to acquiesce in arrangements which treated the school children differently from the others.88. Some witnesses were of opinion that the first reaction of parents, especially if the question were put to them in a casual way in time of peace, would be to refuse to contemplate separa-tion from their children, but that if the dangers to which their children would be exposed, and a detailed scheme for their removal to homes in safer areas, were placed before them, they would probably be willing to agree to part with their children. The arrangement would in effect amount to a transference of the school, with the scholars, a proportion of the teaching and welfare organisation, medical services, books and other equip-ment, and viewed in this light should not be unattractive to parents.89. We have given much anxious consideration to this ques-tion, and in the short time at our disposal have endeavoured to inform ourselves of opinion on the subject. Among others, we have consulted representatives of the Standing Joint Com-mittee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations, the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild, the National Council of Women, the London and National Society for Women&apos;s Service, the Women&apos;s Con-servative Organisation, the Women&apos;s Liberal Federation, and the National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes: also the Dow-ager Marchioness of Reading on behalf of the recently formed organisation known as Women&apos;s Voluntary Services.Recommendations.90. It is our considered opinion that as a matter of organisation a detailed plan for the evacuation of school children, coupled with more general arrangements for the evacuation of other non-essential members of the community, offers a greater probability of success than general arrangements for the evacuation of the population on a family basis. While we do not wish to under-estimate the difficulties of bringing a proportion it may be a substantial proportion of parents round to the view that it is in the best interests of their children of school age that they should be evacuated separately, we believe that if detailed plans were prepared and properly explained the great majority of parents would allow their children to go.
gi. We accordingly recommend, that plans should be prepared in complete detail for the transfer of children of school age in time of war from vulnerable areas to places of greater safety. The school should be treated as the unit, and details should be worked out through the local education authorities with the co-operation of the teachers. It would have to be understood that in any evacuation plans the scheme relating to school children had first claim on transport and reception facilities. As indicated in paragraph 61, the children would be accommo-dated as far as possible in houses where they were assured of a friendly reception and which were conveniently situated with regard to the educational facilities available in the reception areas.92. So far as practicable, the education of the children should be continued in their new surroundings, possibly by the use of a shift system in existing schools and by classes in halls and other improvised accommodation.93. When arrangements in any area are sufficiently advanced for a connected account of them to be given, we think that meetings should be held at the schools when a suitable person can explain the proposals to the parents. We believe that these meetings would serve a useful purpose in removing doubts in the minds of parents and in enabling an estimate to be made of the proportion of parents who would allow their children to be evacuated if war came.94. If either generally or in particular areas there were no substantial response in favour of plans for the separate removal of school children, the idea might have to be dropped. Any work which had been done would not, however, be wasted since the arrangements so far as not used for school children would be equally appropriate apart of course from the role assigned to education authorities and school teachers to other classes of the population.95. If our proposals for school children commend themselves to the Government, it might be well to arrange for a scheme to be prepared for a sample area, before directions are given to local authorities throughout the country to proceed in the matter. London would seem to be a very suitable area for this test. The London County Council have already had the matter under consideration; and a scheme worked out for a portion of the London area by the London County Council and the neighbour-ing local education authorities would prove of great value to other local authorities and would throw up points of difficulty which could be discussed, and if possible settled, before general directions were issued to the local authorities in other vulnerable areas.
g6. We considered how far arrangements similar to those proposed for school children are practicable in the case of children under school age, the ^nfirm and the aged. The position of the sick and of expectant mothers is being dealt with by the Advisory Committee appointed by the Home Secretary on London Casualty Organisation. We believe that the balance of advantage in the case of very young children is not to attempt to separate them from their mothers, but to deal with them under any general arrangements made for the transference from dangerous areas of those who can be spared. The infirm and the aged should similarly be dealt with under any general scheme.
CHAPTER IV. Administration and Finance.Administration.97. The Home Secretary is responsible for giving general directions regarding schemes for the evacuation of the civilian population from areas exposed to attack.98. So far as concerns local arrangements, within the frame-work of general guidance from the Government, the procedure making for the greatest efficiency and despatch is for an exist-ing machine such as the local authority organisation, to be used. This seems to be the arrangement contemplated in the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1937, and the regulations made under that Act.99. The case of London, however, presents special features. We do not think it would be practicable to add to the existing responsibilities of the 28 metropolitan borough councils and there are strong reasons for treating the Greater London Area for this purpose as one unit. We suggest, therefore, that so far as the evacuation problem is concerned an ad hoc organisation should be set up with direct responsibility to the appropriate Depart-ment of State. Any such organisation should of course work in close co-ordination with the other branches of the air raid precautions service in the Greater London Area.100. We desire to emphasise strongly our view that the necessary organisation should be set up without delay, both centrally at the Home Office and locally, to work out plans in peace and to form the nucleus of the staff required in time of war to put these plans into operation.101. A central controlling authority will be required in each zone in which large movements of population are carried out. A general supervision of this kind will be necessary, since, for example, it may be necessary to slow down the evacuation process, either in the catchment area or at the entraining centres, because of difficulties at the reception end.102. As indicated above, we consider that, subject to special arrangements in London, local authorities should provide the executive organisation required in the areas from which evacua-tion will take place and in the reception areas. While there is a vast scope in this work for voluntary service all such assistance must function within the framework of an official machine, on which in the last resort rests the responsibility for planning and executing the schemes in all their details.
103. In the vulnerable areas where refugees must be given directions about routes, times of departure, luggage and so forth, and where transport must be arranged, the responsible authority will find it necessary to designate officers to control the movement of population, with many subordinate officials in charge of arrangements in sub-divisions of the local authority&apos;s area.104. In the reception districts, the billeting of refugees, the keeping of records and the payment of allowances to the owners of billeting accommodation will have to be carried out by persons appointed as paid officials of the responsible authority. There should be a statutory obligation on these officials to carry out the duties imposed upon them. Transport must also be organised in a similar way, subject to any general directions issued by the Traffic Commissioners, and it is to be antici-pated that official resources will be supplemented by large numbers of private cars volunteered for the task. Voluntary bodies could probably play a large part in arranging for the communal feeding of refugees, so far as this proves to be necessary, and for general welfare arrangements.105. If the general direction of schemes within each county comes under a committee of the county council, it might be found desirable to delegate the function of billeting and the general care of the refugees designated for a certain area in the county to the local authority of the detraining centre to which refugees were taken in the first place. There would be an alloca-tion of numbers for the centre and for its surrounding area, and once that number had arrived further refugees would be sent on into other areas.106. The responsibilities of the police are likely to be so heavy under the conditions we have to contemplate that we think it would be desirable as far as possible to avoid placing any specific responsibility upon them in connection with the organisation of evacuation.Finance.Toy. We do not anticipate that the preparation of schemes of evacuation will involve any substantial expenditure in time of peace. If, however, it should prove to be necessary to put these schemes into operation heavy expenditure would be incurred.108. In our view the Government should bear the entire cost of the evacuation and maintenance in safer districts of school children removed from vulnerable areas.109. In the case of any large-scale evacuation covering other members of the community, the cost of transport and free rations at the outset of the transference and the first charge for accom-modation, feeding and general welfare arrangements should fall upon the Government.
no. When evacuation has been completed and conditions have become stabilised, we consider that the authorities should take steps to ascertain the persons who can afford to contribute wholly or partly to their maintenance, and that they should require from such persons a contribution towards the general expenses which the Government are incurring. A man( in receipt of full pay or a soldier in receipt of a separation allowance could not expect to be in pocket by reason of the fact that his dependent relations had been evacuated to a safer place.in. Payments would have to be made in respect of accommo-dation requisitioned as billets and of any rations supplied by private persons. We have not gone into the question of appro-priate rates. There are scales in the Army Act for the billeting of troops and we were informed that the London County Council pay ios. 6d. a week for children boarded out.
CONCLUSIONS.h2. The more important conclusions at which the Committee has arrived and the main recommendations which it has to make may be summarised as follows:  (i) The whole issue in any future war may well turn on the manner in which the problem of evacuation from densely populated industrial areas is handled (paragraph 25).(2) Plans for evacuation are no substitute for measures of active and passive defence, designed to enable production to be maintained in time of war in the industrial areas of this country (paragraph 17).(3) The necessity for some measure of evacuation of non-essential persons from the principal industrial areas must be faced, both on grounds of humanity and to relieve the situation in congested industrial areas (paragraph 26). In any event there would be an exodus, on a scale which cannot accurately be foreseen, from any area which was subjected to repeated air attack (paragraph n).(4) The country will not be fully prepared for attack from a powerful foe until the necessary organisation has been set up and schemes of evacuation worked out (para-graph 29).(5) Schemes must be- on a basis of voluntary evacuation (paragraph 12). Compulsory wholesale evacuation would only arise in limited, areas liable to intensive bombardment or for other reasons, e.g. flooding, rendered uninhabitable (paragraph 28).(6) The plans to be drawn up should be on broad lines, designed to make the fullest practical use of the facilities available. Within the limits of a plan, evacuation could then be carried out in time of emergency to whatever extent was decided upon by the authorities (paragraph 36).(7) There appear to be adequate transport facilities, cer-tainly in the London area, for a scheme of evacuation on any practicable scale. The main line railways would be used, fed by underground railways and buses (paragraphs 41 and 44).(8) In the areas used for the reception of refugees, they should be housed in private dwellings under a scheme of billeting for which compulsory powers would have to be taken, though voluntary arrangements should be relied upon as much as possible especially in the case of school children (paragraphs 60 and 61).(9) Local authorities should be directed to make a survey of billeting accommodation available in suitable areas; and areas should be allotted for the reception of refugees from
each of the main industrial centres (paragraph 59). The areas suggested after a preliminary survey are shown on maps appended to the Report.(10) No serious difficulty is anticipated in the feeding of refugees provided that adequate arrangements are made in advance (paragraph 67).(11) Welfare services will be required in the reception areas and here there is a great scope for voluntary service (paragraph 74).(12) In a vulnerable area which has been partially evacuated it may be practicable to redistribute the remain-ing population more evenly in order to disperse them and lessen the risk (paragraph 75).(13) If, when the initial stage of evacuation is completed, it is found to have resulted in intolerable conditions of con-gestion in the receiving areas, a further transference from those areas to more remote districts should be arranged , (paragraph 63).(14) In the expectation that there will eventually be a substantial measure of support for the idea, plans should be prepared in complete detail for the transference of children of school age, school by school, in time of war from vulnerable areas to places of greater safety (para--   graph 91).(15) No child should be removed without the consent of its parents and steps should be taken to inform parents in time of peace of the detailed plans proposed and to ascer-tain their reactions (paragraphs 86 and 93).(16) Before schemes are prepared throughout the country for school children, there would be advantage in preparing a plan in fairly complete detail for a portion of the London area, as a sample scheme (paragraph 95).(17) Steps sh6uld be taken without delay to set up the necessary central and local organisation for working out schemes of evacuation (paragraph 100).(18); The Government should bear the whole cost of schemes for the evacuation of school children (paragraph 108).(19) In the case of plans covering other members of the community the first charges should be upon the Govern-ment, but those who are evacuated would be expected to make a contribution towards their maintenance (paragraphs 109 and 110).113. We are fully satisfied that a scheme on the lines indicated in this Report is entirely practicable. It could, we believe, be organised for the whole country in the course of a few moriths.
If the need for it were to arise before it had been completed emergency arrangements on the same lines could, we think, be improvised in a very short time.114. Though the operation of such a scheme might be subject to innumerable hitches and interruptions it would, we are con-vinced, enable the Government to keep the situation under con-trol whatever might betide. Thus the chief temptation to a potential enemy to stake everything on the hazard of a knock-out blow would be removed.115. We would emphasise, however, that no scheme of this kind can be considered complete until it is understood by the people and has secured the backing of the overwhelming mass of public opinion. There must therefore be a process of educa-tion of the public. This will begin while the details of the scheme are being elaborated. The instructions to the various authorities and voluntary bodies that will be concerned in the preparation of the detailed plan will be public and should be carefully prepared with this in view. The final stage in the education process will be reached after the completion of the scheme. Literature should then be widely disseminated explain-ing the problem and the measures prepared to deal with it. We attach very great importance to this. The resources of the Press and the British Broadcasting Corporation will no doubt be made fully available and should be freely used. The same agencies could be of the greatest service in the operation of the scheme if unhappily the occasion should ever arise.116. In conclusion we wish to express our acknowledgments to our Secretary, Mr. A. Johnston of the Home Office. He has left nothing undone which could conduce to the expeditious handling of the task entrusted to us and we are greatly indebted to him.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,John Anderson (Chairman).

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   September 1938.SECRET. ^ . Copy No.-       ENCLOSURF   ^COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 332nd Meeting, held on September 15,1938.(1)-EVACUATION OF THE CIVIL POPULATION IN TIME OF WAR.(C.I.D. Paper No. 296-A.)(Previous-reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 330th Meeting, Minute 6.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department covering a Report submitted to him by the Committee on Evacuation appointed on the 24th May to bring under review the problem of transferring persons in time of war from areas likely to be exposed to continual air attack (C.I.D. Paper No. 296-A).SIR JOHN ANDERSON, Chairman of the Committee, introducing the Report, said that his Committee had undertaken a general review of the problem in all its aspects, and in doing so had freely consulted with representatives of the Authorities and Organisations who would be concerned in the execution of any scheme of evacuation. They had assumed that the general public would respond willingly to any instructions for their guidance would be ready to do what was best in the public interest, that persons who could be spared would be encouraged to move, and also that evacuation would be carried out on a voluntary basis. There might, however, be certain areas which were so exposed to attack or so vulnerable in other respects that the Government would have to insist on their compulsory clearance. As regards the proportion of the population which could be spared from its normal location without impairing the wartime efficiency of the country, the Committee, basing its views on data prepared by the Ministry of Labour, considered that for practical purposes this proportion might be taken to be one-third in the case of the densely populated industrial areas. On the practical side the problems to be considered were the arrangements for getting people to the entraining centres; the organisation of transport; the distribution of transferees at the places of detrainment: the provision of accommodation; the arrangements for feeding; and measures for the general welfare of the transferees.As regards transport, London presented the most difficult problem, hut the Committee were satisfied, provided that conditions were not rendered totally impossible by the violence of enemy attack, that existing facilities would serve to remove within a reasonable time the probable number of transferees on the basis of their estimate. Underground Railways and main lines would be the principal means adopted; buses and other forms of -transport playing a subsidiary part.As regards distribution, their view, taken after advice by the London Passenger Transport Board and the main line railways, was that entrainment should be at suitable points on the main line railways other than the termini, and that the transferees should be conveyed by main line trains to fairly large centres up to 50 miles from London, from which they would be distributed by organised road transport.&quot; This would be obtained largely by requisitioning privately-owned vehicles and should not present any very great difficulties.[17904-1] b
As regards accommodation, it was clear that this could only be secured by billeting in private houses of all kinds, and filling them up to the limit. Any other form of accommodation, such as hutted camps, would only provide a very small proportion of the total required. Billeting would be carried out under compulsory powers. The Committee had assumed that these powers would only apply to provision of actual accommodation and not to services. Voluntary arrangements would have to be made in regard to the provision of cooking facilities. This bore directly on the question of feeding. It would be necessary not only to ensure that adequate supplies of food were available; but also, in certain cases, to make arrangements for communal feeding.As regards welfare, it was clear that the transfer of large numbers of people from urban to rural areas was likely to raise social problems of considerable magnitude. It would be necessary to see that an organisation came into being as quickly as possible to deal with questions of general welfare. For this purpose the Committee suggested that use should be made of the voluntary organisations.On the question of finance, he said that, prior to the emergency, no very substantial expenditure would have to be incurred. In the emergency the Govern-ment would have to undertake such financial obligations as were necessary to make the scheme work. In particular, the Committee thought they should be responsible, in the first instance, for transport and subsistence, but that in due course people who could afford to make some payment should be required to do so.Turning to the question of school children, Sir John Anderson explained that special plans should be worked out for dealing with school children as such. The scheme contemplated the removal of the children in school units, with special arrangements for their welfare and provision for the continuance of their education. For such a scheme to be acceptable it would have to be worked out in advance in very great detail. Parents would have to know exactly where their children were going, and to be assured that they would be cared for and be informed if anything went wrong. This was the only way in which parents could be induced to agree to this special plan. The Committee recommended that the Government should bear the whole cost involved in the evacuation and maintenance of school children. There were likely to be objections on the part of some parents to the scheme in any event, and it was thought that they might be more easily induced to agree if no part of the cost fell on them. He recognised, however, that this was a point on which the Chancellor might have- something to say.The Committee had attached to their Report a map showing roughly an allocation of reception areas to each of the main industrial areas of the country. In practice he thought that the accommodation available in the. reception areas would set a limit on the extent of evacuation, but the Committee&apos;s conclusion was that this accommodation would be sufficient to absorb one-third of the population from the vulnerable areas, with the possible exception of Scotland and Northern England, where the housing shortage was more acute than elsewhere.Sir John Anderson then drew attention to paragraph 113 of the Report in which it was stated that the Committee were satisfied that a Scheme on the lines of the Report could be organised for the whole country in the course of a few months, and that emergency arrangements on the lines of the Scheme could be improvised in a very short time. In this connection there were three matters to which he wished to draw special attention. The first related to London, where the crux of the problem was the maintenance of public order. The Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police would not be in a position to give any assurances on this matter unless his existing resources were substantially augmented. He urged therefore that Sir Philip Game should be told without delay how many troops he could rely on with certainty for this purpose. When he had this information he would know how best to make his plans and dispositions. He understood that the troops at present in the London area were hopelessly inadequate for the purpose. The problem, of course, was not confined to London, but it probably would arise there in the most acute form.Secondly, if troops were used they must be widely distributed. He recognised the military objections to dispersion^ but it was.necessary that the troops should be so disposed that they could be brought into any particular area very speedily if the need arose. Where there was a risk of panic, or an actual panic existed, the mere presence of a body of disciplined men had a steadying effect. Police Forces would have to be thinly distributed and would deal With incipient panic:
but to supplement them it was necessary to have available at short notice fairly large bodies of disciplined personnel. Thirdly, in any emergency plan he stressed the great importance of ensuring that food supplies were entirely adequate. Any evidence that the interests of the population had been cared for and provided against in advance, would also have a steadying effect. ,There was one other matter which also bore on this point, namely that, if the emergency came, it was essential that people should not be idle. Clear directions should be given to them what to do, and as far as possible they should be found some occupation at once, e.g., in digging protective trenches. Hanging about doing nothing would have a most prejudicial effect on morale.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that he was sure the Committee would wish to thank Sir John Anderson and the other members on the Committee for their work on this Report. The Committee was representative of all parties in the House of Commons. He had invited the leaders of the Opposition parties to nominate their representatives, and it included the member who was Chairman of the Air Raid Precautions Committee of Members of the House of Commons. To have produced a unanimous report on a subject on which wide divergencies of opinion might have been expected was a remarkable result, and he thought that the Government would have the backing of all parties in the House of Commons if the recommendations of the Report were put into effect.To implement in detail the recommendations of the Report would take several months, but it was perfectly practicable as an emergency matter to make a start and achieve considerable progress by an early date. He had already been in touch with several Ministers concerned, and had also seen Mr. Herbert Morrison and Sir George Gater.&quot; If the Committee accepted the principles of the Report, they could rely on the Home Office and other Departments concerned to get an emergency scheme on the lines of the Report into shape within a few days.Finally, his covering memorandum contemplated immediate publication with a broadcast by Sir John Anderson on the night preceding publication. This represented his intention before the present crisis arose. In existing conditions he hoped there would be general agreement that it was undesirable to publish the Report at the present moment. Mr. Morrison was in agreement with this view. If this was the Committee&apos;s decision, it became all the more essential to ensure that there was no delay in getting on with the preparation of a detailed scheme, so that when the Report was published they would be able to state at the same time the progress that had been made.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that, when the time came for publication, there were one or two matters Avhich the Air Ministry would like to see omitted from the Report.Mr. WALTER ELLIOT said he entirely supported the views of the Home Secretary. Steps had, in fact, already been taken by his department in con-junction with the Board of Education to set up the administrative machinery that would be required to put into effect the principles of the Report. This machinery was ready to start immediately.SIR THOMAS INSKIP pointed out that the preparation of a detailed scheme based on the principles of the Report would take many months to complete. The Committee was unfortunately faced with the possibility that it might be necessary to put a scheme into force within a period of three weeks to a month.,- SIR JOHN ANDERSON said that the Committee had always kept in mind, when formulating principles of a general scheme, the possibility that something-might have to be done very quickly, and they had avoided putting forward any proposals which would be completely valueless if an emergency scheme- was required rapidly. The part of the scheme which required considerable time to work out wajs that dealing with the School Children. The scheme, would involve a great deal of consultation with the various local authorities concerned, an explanation of the scheme to parents, and the securing of their acquiescence which might need much persuasion; Moreover, for children moving without their parents, greater care was required in selecting billeting accommodation. The general population, however, could be fitted in without so much discrimination. He thought it was quite practicable to work out at short notice an improvised scheme for the general public on lines which would later be capable of easy conversion to the long-term scheme if a sufficient interval ensued.[17904-1] B 2
LORD STANHOPE said that the Board of Education had already been in touch with the London County Council and they were satisfied that if the children were moved with their teachers a large proportion of the parents would be prepared to let them go. Both for the short-term or long-term scheme it was essential to know how much the Government were prepared to pay in respect of each child. He suggested that the children should be taken as far as possible away from London and in no case less than 30 miles. Within that distance there would be a large number of persons who would have to remain by reason of their occupation in an emergency, and it would be better to have the children outside that area. Secondly, he enquired how far the problem of feeding had been thought out. He recalled that a Committee had reported towards the end of the last war that if we lost control of the South Coast ports it would be impossible to feed London through the West Coast ports. It was therefore very important that the population from London should not be transferred eastwards or southwards unless arrangements were contemplated for their subsequent transfer towards the westSIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the last point raised by the President of the Board of Education was clearly one which must be kept in mind, but at the moment he suggested the Committee should concentrate on the conditions under which the school children would move. He was anxious to take Sir George Gater and the Local Authorities into consultation in order to work out a scheme in detail.Mr. COLVILLE said that he was anxious to have the same authority in regard to Scotland. He was certain that, if a start were made at once, they could make very substantial progress with an improvised scheme within three or four weeks, so that, if a crisis developed, it would be possible to carry out some very useful steps. In the case of Glasgow, if the crisis came in the winter, the estimated transferable proportion of the population could be moved very quickly to resorts on the River Clyde, which at that period of the year would have a great deal of vacant accommodation and were accustomed to receive and provide for visitors in very large numbers at other times of the year.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the discussion pointed clearly to the importance of giving general approval straight away to the recommendations of the Committee. The fact that immediate publication was considered inadvisable was, in fact, a positive advantage, as it would enable many necessary intermediate steps to be taken without interference from persons and organisations who other-wise might raise a great many questions causing delay.Mr. OLIVER STANLEY said that the food aspect was one of extreme urgency. The Board of Trade could do nothing on this until other Departments had made a good deal of progress. He appreciated that the extreme importance of the question of food supplies was generally recognised, and it was essential that the Food Department should be kept closely in touch with the development of the scheme.Mr. BURGIN thought that the Report should be approved. His Depart-ment was in the same position as the Board of Trade, in that they could not make their plans until a number of matters had been settled by other Departments. The distribution of refugees from the detraining points to their billeting places, for example, was a transport function, but he obviously could not approach the A.A. and R.A.C. until he knew where the detraining points were to be, the numbers that might have to be handled, and other essential information. In the meantime, a good deal of thought had been given by his Department as to the kind of arrangement that would be required at the detraining points.&quot;A discussion then ensued on the question of allocating Army units for the maintenance of law and order.Mr. HORE-BELISHA said that no proposals in regard to this matter had been circulated to the Committee. It was not referred to in the Report or in the covering Memorandum and he had no idea that the Committee were going to be asked to take a decision on the matter. The Army was a force made up of formed and organised units. It was recognised that it could be used in aid of the Civil Power in an emergency but that was not its primary duty, and it was required
* CP: 26 (38) ; also Annex to D.P; (P.) 21.for other purposes. It would be most wasteful to use the Army as a police force in view of its extremely expensive equipment and training for purely; military purposes.- -SIRKINGSLEY WOOD said that the question must be considered in relation to the conditions that might be anticipated. The first duty of the Army was the defence of this country, and this task had a priority higher than the provision of an expeditionary force.SIR THOMAS INSKIP referred to paragraph 2 of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War, dated the 10th Februarj7, 1938,* which reads as follows : &quot; Home Defence.In preparing the Army for war the menace of air attack is a primary consideration. On the outbreak of war defence against air attack may be the primary requirement; in this major respect Home Defence is in the first category of importance and in a form unknown in 1914. The priorities in Home Defence are :. air defence; Internal Security which assumes a widened scope in the light of air raid precautions; and Coast Defence.&quot;This appeared to represent what the Home Secretary was asking for.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that his requirements went a little further, for it was essential that, in the case of London, the Chief Commissioner, Metro-politan Police, should know exactly what troops he would have at his disposal.SIR WARREN FISHER said that he felt sure that the War Office fully recognised the demands that the internal security aspect of Civil Defence would make on the Army. The General Staff had been represented at a meeting of the Passive Defence Sub-Committee, of which he was Chairman, which had considered and approved the scheme for a Regional Organisation in time of war; and it was implicit in that scheme that the Regional Commissioner should be able to call upon the Army for assistance in regard to internal security. A liaison officer had been provided by the War Office at each Regional Commissioner^ headquarters for this purpose.Mr. HORE-BELISHA said there would be no disagreement regarding the general principles governing the employment of the Army, but he was not sure if he had fully appreciated the significance of the suggestion made by Sir John Anderson. If it were a question of how many units would be available, and the purpose and length of time for which they would be required, he thought the matter needed to be worked out in considerable detail.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he thought there would be no disagreement about the responsibility of the Armed Forces to assist the Civil Power in an emergency where the latter&apos;s resources were not adequate for the purpose. The emergency which they were now considering was of rather a special character, however, since the nature of it could be foreseen in advance and plans made to deal with it. One of the points to be covered by any plan would be the arrange-ments for maintaining internal security.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD drew attention to the fact that the problem would not arise only in London: Other large centres of pojpulation, for example Birmingham and Coventry, in which the Air Force were particularly interested, would also have to be provided for.SIR WARREN FISHER suggested that the matter should be referred to an informal Committee which he would convene, consisting of himself, the Chief Commissioner, Metropolitan Police, a representative of the Home Office and of the General Staff.THE COMMITTEE agreed to this course.; ...SIR JOHN SIMON said that, whilst he was prepared to give his&apos; approval generally to the Report as a whole, he would like the question of finance kept open for further discussion between the Departments concerned as regards the
details. In particular he was anxious that there should be no acceptance of the view that the whole cost of the evacuation of school children should be a permanent and unlimited liability on the Exchequer, regardless of circumstances.[Sir John Simon left the Meeting at this point.]THE COMMITTEE then considered how far the proposals in regard to the evacuation scheme should be disclosed to persons and organisations outside the Government Departments immediately concerned.SIR WARREN FISHER pointed out that the evacuation scheme was only a part of the Civil Emergency Defence Scheme, known as the &quot; Y &quot; Plan. He thought that in regard to all aspects of that plan Chief Constables and those Local Authority officials and representatives of outside interests who were immediately concerned with, or affected by, the arrangements contemplated therein should now be taken into confidence at the discretion of the Ministers of the various Departments concerned.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that he was a little nervous of disclosing the whole of the &quot; Y&quot; Plan until the actual emergency arose. When it did arise the Local Authorities would accept supersession by the Regional Commissioners acting on behalf of the Central Government. But if it was disclosed prior to an emergency this supersession might be resented by certain Local Authorities and this might lead to a good deal of discussion and dispute. On the other hand, he felt that they would all accept it in the actual emergency. His own feeling was to make an exception in the case of Chief Constables, and he thought they should now be instructed to open the sealed letters in connection with the scheme which they had already received. They would make themselves aware of their contents and would not take any action until further instructed.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that he would be content if this course was adopted.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that, in the case of County Clerks, a further consideration was what exactly to tell them. Were they to be told merely to get ready, or were they actually to start a billeting survey ?Mr. ELLIOT suggested that the County Clerks should be called together and the proposals discussed with them confidentially. An explanation could be given of the billeting scheme that was contemplated. He added that a great deal of information in regard to accommodation from the point of view of billeting was already to be found in the Housing Branch of the Ministry of Health.LORD HALIFAX suggested that if the absence to start an actual survey would involve delay in the preparation and, if needed, the operation of an improvised scheme, he did not think that Departments should be deterred from going ahead merely because a certain amount of publicity was involved.Mr. COLVILLE said that the information in the Housing Branches of the Health Departments only referred to working-class houses. He&apos; thought that it would be impossible to carry out a survey without publicity. Nevertheless, a canvass of possible accommodation should be proceeded with.LORD HALIFAX suggested that the matter could be left to the Depart-ments concerned on the understanding that they would not feel obliged to delay action merely out of regard for the publicity involved.LORD STANHOPE enquired whether in the short-term scheme it was proposed to deal with school children as suggested in the long-range scheme of the Report.THE COMMITTEE generally agreed that it would be impossible in any short-term scheme to deal with school children on the basis of the Report, and that in such a scheme the children must move with their parents in accordance with the arrangements, contemplated for transferees generally in the &quot; Y &quot; Plan.In reply to a question by Sir Thomas Inskip, SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that compulsory powers would be needed and would be included in the War Emergency Powers Act.
Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : (a) To approve in principle the following recommendations of the AndersonCommittee on Evacuation, as summarised in paragraph 6 of &quot;C.I.D. Paper No. 296-A, viz. : (i) Schemes should be prepared on a basis of voluntary evacuation. Compulsory wholesale evacuation would only arise in limited areas liable to intensive bombardment (e.g., the neighbourhood of docks) or for some other reasons (e.g., flooding) rendered uninhabitable.(ii) Plans should be drawn up on broad lines designed to make the fullest practical use of the facilities (transport, housing, feeding, &amp;c.) available. Within the limits of a plan, evacuation could then be carried out in time of emergency to whatever extent was decided upon by the authorities.(iii) In the areas used for the reception of refugees, they should be housed in private dwellings under a scheme of billeting, for which compulsory powers would have to be taken.(iv) In the expectation that there will eventually be a substantial measure of support for the idea, plans should be prepared in complete detail for the transference of children of school age, school by school, in time of war, from vulnerable areas to places of greater safety. No child should be removed without the consent of its parents, and steps should be taken to inform - parents in time of peace of the detailed plans proposed and to ascertain their reactions.(b) That Departments concerned take immediately such steps as theyconsider necessary to enable an improvised short-term scheme of * evacuation, based on the above recommendations except in regard to children of school age, to be put into force at the earliest possible moment in the immediate future. In this connection action should not be withheld on grounds of publicity involved if it would lead to an appreciable delay in implementing the scheme.(c) That, for the improvised short-term scheme, school children should not betreated as set out in (a) (iv) above, but should be dealt with in accordance with the arrangements for transferees set out in Civil Emergency Defence Scheme &quot; Y.&quot;(d) As regards finance, that the matter should be considered in detail by theTreasury with the other Government Departments concerned.(e) To invite Sir Warren Fisher in conjunction with the Commissioner,Metropolitan Police, and representatives of the Home Office and General Staff to consider the question of the disposition, number, duration and employment of Army units to be available in aid of the Civil power in the initial stages of a war. (/) As regards the operation of the Civil Emergency Defence Scheme (&quot; Y &quot; Plan) generally, to approve the confidential communication by the appropriate Departments of an outline of the scheme to Chief Constables and such representatives of Local Authorities and organisa-tions outside the Government Service as are vitally concerned with the arrangements upon which the Scheme is based.(g) To take note that, when the time came for publication of the Report,there were one or two matters which the Secretary of State for Air would like to see omitted : and that the Home Office and Air Ministry should consult together with a view to reaching agreement on the emendations which would be involved.(h) That C.I.D. Paper No. 296-A, together with a record of the discussion and conclusions of the Committee of Imperial Defence, should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet.* * * * * *Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1, September 15, 1938.
