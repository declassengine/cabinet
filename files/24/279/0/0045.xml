(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY No.__(4 I. SECRET.CP. No.  245/38.CABINET.INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 24th October, 1938.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 84th October,  1938, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.     Provincial Ministries.    The fall of the Assam Ministry was reported in the last Appreciation. The formation of a new coalition Ministry by the Congress leader of the Opposition brings the number of Provinces subject to Congress control up to eight out of eleven: but it remains to he seen whether a somewhat capricious legislature will keep the new Government in power.      As soon as the late Premier resigned,  those members of the Assembly whose defection was the cause of his resignation rallied again to his side.      As a result the new Opposition claimed a clear majority and tabled 56 motions of no confidence against the new Ministry.      The Speaker, however, adjourned the Assembly sine die and so prevented a trial of strength.      On the pretext of intervening holidays he has now fixed December 1st as the date of reassembling.      The new Ministry at first contained five Hindu Ministers:    recently three Moslems have been added.The position of the Sind Ministry remains precarious The Premier,  though a Mohamedan, has resisted the very strong pressure of the Moslem League meeting in Karachi to reorganise the Ministry under the aegis of the League. Its stability will be tested when the Assembly meets vnext month.In the Central Provinces,  the fallen premier Dr. Khare has been expelled from the Congres-s Party for 2 years by order of the Working Committee.      His attempt to organise a. revolt and upset the. new ministry has not met with success in the Assembly;-   and for the time being
the ministry is secure.Elsewhere, the position of the ministries callsFfor no remarks*2e Proyincial Administration.    The negotiations betweenthe Bengal Government, Gandhi and Subhas Bose for an arrangement about the release of terrorist convicts have broken down.      The Government are,  therefore, proceeding with their programme, which is to release at an early date prisoners who are in poor health or have only a short period of imprisonment to serve and to place the other cases before an Advisory Board.      Gandhi has issued a statement on the subject which suggests that he will make a particular effort to secure the release of all prisoners by April next.In Bombay,  the Trades Disputes Bill has made slow progress,  thanks to the dilatory tactics of the Opposition. The Tenancy Bill, which appears to have few friends, has not yet been introduced.      The bill providing for the restoration to the original holders of lands which were confiscated for non payment of land revenue in the civil disobedience campaign of 1931, has been passed in the Assembly by a large majority and also by the Council. Its terms have been strongly attacked as unfair to the present holders.Both in the Central Provinces and in Madras the Congress Ministries have taken action to curb the freedom., of the Press:    in the former Province a newspaper, which, in support of Doctor Khare, made a scurrilous attack on Congress Leaders and Gandhi in particular, was annihilated, by a demand for a large sum as security for its future behaviour:    in Madras an Editor is being prosecuted for sedition and stirring up communal hatred in the course- of the anti-Hindi agitation.
Agrarian agitation in a part of the North:West Frontier Frovinee has given trouble hut has been.dealt with firmlyt      Gandhi is now on a visit to this Province and is credited with a desire to curb the aberrations from strict Congress doctrine of Doctor Khan Sahib&apos;s Ministry.In the Punjab the agitation of non-agricultural classes against legislation designed to benefit agriculturists has. been dwarfed by striking demonstrations of satisfaction from the latter;    and, though the Ministry may lose some support in the Legislature, their popularity in the countryside appears to have been enhanced.In the United Provinces the Select Committee has at last produced its report on the Tenancy Bill;    the land owners on the Committee have submitted dissenting minutes and the progress of the Bill is likely to be marked by keen controversy.3.      India and the threat of war.      During the latter half of September the European situation was followed with close attention.      Sympathy with Czecho-Slovakia and hostility to the Dictators roused expectations among journalists and politicians which were disappointed by the terms of settlement.      The disappointment is further explained by the prevalent belief that India had much to gain, and little to lose, from a war in Europe.      For nationalists there was the hope of obtaining constitutional concessions, either as the reward of support or as the price for refraining from embarrassing agitation. Industrialists and agriculturists had reason to expect &apos; higher profits and prices.      It so happened that the All-India Committee was meeting in Delhi at the time:    a pronouncement of policy, and even discussion, was deliberately avoided,  and the Working Committee was entrusted with power to deal with the situation as it
developed.      What steps would have &quot;been taken can only be surmised: ^but there is reason to believe that the Working Committee was for the most part in favour of bargaining with the British Government for constitutional favours in return for co-operation? whereas Gandhi deprecated such opportunism and desired to impose his view that the principle of non-violence required complete detachment from the conflict.      Had his view prevailed the Congress Ministries could not have remained in Office for long,  since a war would have required in tue Provinces positive activities of various kinds.&quot;In contrast to the silence of the Congress,  the Premier of the Punjab, whence the Army is mainly recruited, took an early opportunity of pledging to Britain in impressive terms the unstinted support of his Province.The Munich Agreement gave extremists an outlet for their disappointment in condemnation of Britain[s attitude-represented as due either to timidity or to secret sympathy with the Dictators,      More sober opinion has tended to adopt the criticisms of the British Government which have been expressed in some quarters in England.      There has been little evidence of any sense of the incalculable disaster which another great war would inflict on the Wor&quot;ld. 4&apos;      T:ng Cor.;-r-ess Party.    The session of the Vforking Committee and the all-India Congress Committee, held in Delhi during the last week of September, was on the whole, unexciting.      Gandhi has for some time been concentrating on the necessity for purging the party of its violent elements,  and the lead he has given resulted in an important resolution being passed on &apos;&apos;civil liberties&quot;.      The purport is that,   as the theory of civil liberty has been abused to cover Various forms of violence,  Congress will support measures taken &quot;by Congress Governments in opposition to such
activities for the defence of life and property. Strong views were expressed on this subject;    left wing amendments were defeated, and about thirty members left the meeting&quot;&apos;in protest.      The predominance of the moderate element in Congress has clearly been favoured by experience of administration gained by Congress Ministries..A resolution on Federation merely endorsed the previous resolution passed at Haripura in February.      The equivocal attitude of Congress towards the States was again expressed in a resolution which deplored the action taken in various States against Congress agitators and at the same time reiterated a policy of non-interference in affairs of the States.      A resolution which was framed by the Working Committee, but did not come before the All-India Committee, apparently owing to lack of time, deprecated interference by the local Congress Committees in governmental administration.5.      The Moslem League..-   There has been a further interchange of letters between the League and the Congress High Command.&quot; The result is to leave the deadlock un-resolved.The Working Committee of the All-India Moslem League met in Karachi in the second week of October.      The speeches of Jinnah and of a number of others bitterly condemned Congress.      The unsuccessful attempt to bring the Sind Ministry under the control of the League has been already mentioned.      A resolution condemned the Federal scheme and recommended that the framing of a suitable constitution for India should be reviewed so that the &apos;&apos;honourable and legitimate status due to Moslems&quot; should be secured.     As regards Palestine, the Conference urged the British Government to cancel the Balfour declaration, withdraw the partition scheme,  and ^confer full independence upon Palestine&apos;&apos;1.      It uttered a warning, that if the present pro-Jewish policy is continued, the Moslems of India will
look upon Britain as the enemy of Islam and will &quot;adopt all measures that may he devised hy the Cairo conference for the protection, and freedom of the Holy Land of Lsla^1&apos;1&quot; 6.      Labour.  The situation in Bihar has been unsettled. There was a sudden strike in 2 collieries on September 26th. No grievances were stated and no notice was given, and an attempt was made to tamper with the pumps.      Police brought the disorder under control.      The strike at Gokak mills in Bomb ay has-been in progress for 3 months, but is now weakening.      In Madras,  about 1800 workers in the Government Press struck on September 22nd;    they returned to duty on 30th when threatened with dismissal.7.      Communal.    The great Hindu festival of Dussehra passed off peacefully throughout India.      At Multan in the Punjab a disturbance between Hindus and Moslems arose from a trivial incident, and about thirty persons were injured and a number  &apos; . of buildings set on fire.      In Delhi the trouble has continued. The order prohibiting entry on the disputed site mentioned in the last Appreciation has been persistently defied by parties of.volunteers, who have been arrested.      The Sadhu himself, on emerging from hospital, was served with a prohibitory order: this he defied,  and he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment.      On October 13th a Hindu procession held in furtherance of this agitation came into conflict with Moslems, and in subsequent street fighting three Hindus were killed and some fifty persons were injured.      This incident appears to have sobered the disputants.8* 4     Cg.g-.tral Legislature.    The meetings of both Chambers concluded in the third week of September.      Official Bills which passed through both Houses include a measure to strengthen the law penalising cruelty to animals;    a bill providing for emergency powers to prevent the spread of epidemics by air, and another designed to check &quot;un-assisted&quot; emigration of Indian labour.
9* General.      Another railway accident, attended withsome loss of life, occurred on the East India Railway on October 16th.      As in the accident of June 8th on this line, there is reason to suspect sabotage.As a result of prolonged drought the crops in the south-eastern areas of the Punjab have failed and scarcity conditions prevail.10. Y/aziristan.    Between 20th and 25th September a determined attempt was made to rid the Ahmadzai tribal salient north of Bannu of the band of hostiles who, under the leadership of Mehrdil, had made the area a base for their raids into the adjoining districts of Bannu and Kohat. After five days operations the columns withdrew, having dispersed the enemy and inflicted many casualties at little cost to themselves.      The R.A.P.  co-operated effectively throughout.The Faqir of Ipi has been in British tribal territory throughout the month in inaccessible country north-west of Razmak.     Air proscription of the area has effectually prevented any mass gathering of his followers, but scattered gangs have continued to harass camps and communications and to kidnap travellers on the roads.Raids into the settled districts have been numerous and two were particularly serious.      On September 27th a gang of about 100 tribesmen attacked a village in the Dera Gazi Khan district of Punjab and was engaged by levies and villagers.      In the course of the action a British District Superintendent of Police was severely wounded.      The raiders vlost several men in subsequent pursuit in which aircraft co-operated with Military Police and irregular forces in blocking their line of retreat.      On the night of 5th/6th October another village in the Dera Ismail Khan district was raided by a gang of about 80.      Some.shops and houses were, looted and burnt and 8 Hindus were wounded in resisting the raiders.
