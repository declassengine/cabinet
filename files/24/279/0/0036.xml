W. H. I.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1, October 19, 1938.Memorandum by the Admiralty.Summary of past events.&quot;WHEN the 35 per cent, ratio Naval Agreement was made with Germany in 1935 it was stated that Germany intended to complete the whole of her quota of 35 per cent, of our tonnage by the end of 1942. Accordingly a forecast of our tonnage in each category of ship for this date was given to Germany in July, 1935. The tonnage for capital ships represented 15 ships, and in a memo-randum handed to the German Naval Attache it was stated that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s-Government will communicate any alterations in those figures in due course, when the future British building programme has been decided upon.&quot;2   A modified forecast was communicated to Germany some 18 months later in March, 1937, immediately before the announcement of our 1937 building programme, but no alteration was made in the capital ship tonnage because (a) No decision having been taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to our future naval strength, it was not known what, if any, old ships would be scrapped when our new ships of the King George V Class were completed in 1940 and 1941. (M Germany had not laid down the fifth large capital ship &quot; H &quot; (to which she was already entitled), and as she would still have time to complete any additional ships which she might be allowed if we gave her a ^revised forcecast in March, 1938, a final decision on our future strength was not a matter of urgency.3. In November, 1937, further agreements were reached with Germany on the manner of giving forecasts of British strength. The German Government stated that they desired to receive adequate notice of any modifications which His Majesty&apos;s Government might decide to make, either in the forecast up to the end of 1942, or in any future forecast, and pointed out difficulties which might arise if they were to declare an annual programme in accordance with the 1937 Naval [18075] B
Agrecmient, and this were to be followed by a declaration of an annual programme by His Majesty&apos;s Government which would, in effect, upset the-long-term forecast previously&quot;given to the German Government, They were assured that the, nptifi-nations of modifications in a previous forecast would always reach the German Government in sufficient time to prevent a situation arising such as the German Government had^contemplated. The British representatives also stated that any modifications, either in the forecast up to the end of 1942 or in any subsequent forecast;: would be notified as long as possible in advance of the date of completion of the ships which would cause the figures in the forecast to be modified.4. It is considered that the above undertakings oblige us, in fairness to Germany, to inform her before each capital ship is laid down whether such a ship is in replacement of overage tonnage or is an addition to the strength of our battlefleet. Only:with such information could Germany hope to reach and maintain the full quota of tonnage in the capital ship category to which she is entitled by treaty. The Admiralty attach the highest importance to the preser-yation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and therefore favour the meticulous fulfilment of its terms, both in the letter and in the spirit.5. When the question of an amended forecast to Germany was again brought up, in the Spring of 1938, the position as to the future strength of the Navy was uncertain, as financial discussions regarding available funds were still proceeding. It was decided, therefore, to communicate to Germany a figure based on 15 ships, qualified by a note to the effect that in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government deciding to retain certain older ships which would otherwise be scrapped, the tdtaltonnage would increase to a figure representing 20 ships. This communication resulted in an enquiry by the German Naval Attache- in June, 1938, asking which figure Germany was to take as the basis for her quota, 15 or 20 .ships. The Naval Attache was informed that we hoped to give him a definite reply before the end of September, 1938, and though we have asked the German Government to delay a little longer, it has how become imperative to send k definite reply.6. Since the Spring the position is somewhat clearer, although, as the Government will be aware, no final decision has yet been taken as to the ultimate standard of the Fleet when completely rebuilt. Nevertheless, not only is it necessary to give the German Government an immediate answer, but the factors still uncertain do not really affect the position at the end of 1942.The question of scrapping.7. Now that the building programmes up to arid including the programme of 1938 are settled, the only question to be decided is the number of old capital ships that are to be scrapped before the end of 1942. It would not be necessary to take a tentative decision on the scrapping- question now, were it not for the necessity of communicating the consequent tonnage figure to Germany.General considerations in favour of early scrapping of our older ships.8. The following are reasons which may be advanced for scrapping our older capital ships :-(a) The general fighting efficiency of our older unmodernised ships (Royal Sovereign Class) is somewhat low in comparison with modern standards, due chiefly to their lack of horizontal protection which renders them vulnerable to air attack and long-range fire of large calibre guns.(6) The slow speed of this class of battleship (3 knots less than the next slowest ships of the Nelson Class) and their low endurance, impose considerable tactical and strategical limitations on any fleet of which they form part,(6) If we retain all our older ships we cannot afford to keep all in commission : some must be in reserve. The latter could not, therefore, be considered as fully efficient units from the date of mobilisation.(d) Considerable economy would be effected by their early scrapping, since a large number of Active Service ratings have to be riiaintairied ready to man ships in reserve on mobilisation. ,(e) If the ships are kept it will be necessary to spend more money on keeping them efficient, the four older ships having had no sort of modernisation done to
them up to date except for the strengthening of their anti-aircraft armament. It is not contemplated to reconstruct them; and moreover, it would not be practicable to undertake this work in the Royal Dockyards within the next year or two except at the expense of Other pressing work. Even then, modernisation takes 18 months to 2 years to complete.General considerations against early scrapping of our older capital ships.9.-(a) Our older battleships, whatever might be their value as ships of the battle line, which is certainly not negligible, would be of unquestionable use in subsidiary roles, such as escorts for important convoys against powerful raiders, or as base ships at any advanced or undefended base we might use in war.(b) The smaller the number of our capital ships the less is the margin avail-able for refits, large repairs, &amp;c, or for any casualties or mishaps which may occur in war.   This is a most important consideration.(6) Large sums of money have been spent on one ship of the Royal Sovereign class, Royal Oak and the Bar ham in the way of general refit rearmament and additional armour protection to, make them more suitable for modern warfare. Smaller sums, in the region of  200,000 per ship, have been spent recently on refitting the 4 older Royal Sovereigns and improving their A.A. armament.Effect of 35 per cent. Ratio A greement.10. There is a further important consideration introduced by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The more tonnage we retain, the more tonnage Germany is allowed to build, and although her allowance is only in the proportion of 35 per cent, of our tonnage her effective strength will be in a greater propor-tion than this for some years, because she is able to build new ships as against our old tonnage.11. The agreement is on the basis of the aggregate tonnage in each category, i.e., Germany is allowed to build in capital ships 35 per cent, of the aggregate tonnage of British capital ships, and there is an arrangement for the &quot; adjustment &quot; of a left over quantity of tonnage insufficient for the construction of a ship. Thus, the exact number of ships that Germany may build for the various numbers which we may retain is a matter of somewhat complicated arithmetic and interpretation of the treaty, and is also dependent on the size of ships which Germany constructs.* Broadly speaking, the situation may be summed up as follows : Excluding the 3 Deutschland class of armoured ships, Germany has. already four capital ships built and building, and on the figures already given to&apos; her (representing 15 British battleships) is entitled to lay down one additional ship.16 ships is the maximum which we can retain, while being reasonably sure* that Ger-many is restricted to     ....  1 more large capital shipgiving her a total      , \ of ....       ....  5 ships.19 ships    Ditto.    ....      ....      ...... 2 more    Ditto ....      .... 6 ships.22 ships    Ditto     ....      ....      .... 3 more    Ditto ....      .... 7 ships.12. As, apart from financial considerations, it is clearly to our advantage-to retain the maximum number of ships that will restrict Germany to 1, 2 or 3. additional ships, our choice of total should be either, 16, 19 or 22 ships.16 Ships.13. If we retain only 16 ships, we keep the German capital ship strength to the lowest possible figure, that, in fact, to which she is already entitled, provided that she continues to observe the terms of the Treaty. This she has shown every sign of doing so far, but if we were to give her this low figure,, which prevents her from increasing her capital ship fleet beyond her present allowance and at the same time gives us the power, at any moment in the next&apos;[: .. * See Appendix. .[18075] &apos; b 2
few years, to exceed our quota compared to hers by refraining from scrapping any of these ships, it seems at least possible that she would either disbelieve our statement or refuse to carry out the agreement. This last step she might conceivably justify by quoting paragraph 2 (c) of Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s letter of the 18th June, 1935, in Command Paper 4930 of 1935, and alleging that we were not maintaining &quot; the general equilibrium of naval armaments as normally maim tained in the past&apos;&apos; if we allowed our strength compared to that of Japan to fall so low. It is very much to our interest to avoid giving Germany any excuse for departing from the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.14. By adopting this figure we should also be reducing our strength dangerously low in comparison with that of Germany plus Japan. We should retain only 16 capital ships as against Germany&apos;s 5 and 3 Deutschlands and Japan&apos;s 12 or 13. Assuming all our ships to be available, this means that to face Japan in the Far East we could send only 8 British ships, although only one of these would be not fully modernised.15. We cannot avoid at any time having some of our capital ships out of action, undergoing long refits, and by our present forecasted programme we should have two in 1942, so that our available strength will be even less than that indicated above.16. Again, if we scrap down to 16 ships by the end of 1942, we must begin scrapping the earlier ships before they have reached the full period of 26 years, which normally constitutes the life of a capital ship. Amongst those scrapped would be the Royal Oak and the Barham, on which, as stated above, large sums of money have been spent in rearmament and additional armour protection.22 Ships.17. The date of completion of the two 1938 programme battleships is not certain, but, if no scrapping took place, we may expect to have 22 capital ships about the end of 1942 or early in 1943. If we announce the corresponding tonnage figure to Germany, she would be entitled to lay down in May 1939 3 ships instead of the one to which she is at present entitled, supposing she continues to build ships of 35,000 to 40,000 tons. Thus Germany would get 2 extra modern capital ships, or, if she chose to build them, a greater number, of smaller modern ships (making 7 in all), which might cause us much trouble in the most dangerous areas, the Atlantic and our home waters.* The result would be, therefore, that, while we should retain all our older capital ships, they would compare badly with the new German ships.18. Our numerical strength would be 22 as against Germany&apos;s 7 and 3 Deutschlands and Japan&apos;s 12 or 13. At the best, this would enable us to send a fleet to face Japan comprising 12 ships, but these would include the 5 old ships of the Royal Sovereign class.19 Ships.19. If we retain 19 ships Germany gets one ship more than she is at present entitled to, making her total 6 and 3 Deutschlands. Our total of 19 would compare with Germany&apos;s 6 and 3 Deutschlands and Japan&apos;s 12 or 13, and the Fleet we could send to the Far East might be 10 ships, of which 6 would be new or fully modernised.20. The ships we should scrap to reach this figure would be 3 of the Royal Sovereign class, which have not been modernised. This would not involve scrapping any of our ships before the year in which they became over-age, and the total figure 19 gives us a much better margin than does 16 to allow for ships undergoing long refit or repair, and is a more practicable figure than 22 from the point of view of manning and maintenance.21. Under this arrangement it would not be necessary to scrap our first ship until the completion of the last ship of the 1937 programme, i.e., towards the end of 1941.   We should, therefore, be maintaining the full strength that we*Npte.- The low limits by Treaty for a Capital Ship are 17,500 tons displacement and guns of not less than 10-inch calibre.
are able up till that time. Moreover, Germany is not entitled today down any new capital ships before May 1939, and these ships probably could not be completed before the end of 1942. Our position vis-a-vis Germany during the next 3 critical years would therefore be maintained at its best.22. The proposals here put forward do not in any way prejudge the decision of His Majesty V Government as to the final strength iii capital ships at which; we are aiming. It will not be for several years yet that we have to give a forecast to Germany involving a decision on scrapping or retaining our old but fully modernised capital ships of the Warspite class. In the meantime, unless we are to fall behind and get into a bad position, we are bound to continue the process -of replacing our old fleet by new ships. It would, indeed, be advantageous to endeavour to expedite it. But the increase in numbers herein proposed is merely the result of retaining some of our older ships during the next few critical years.23. Though it is necessary to give figures to Germany now, there does not seem to be any need to make them public until at least the presentation of next &apos; year&quot;o Naval Estimates to Parliament. It is thought that it will be necessary then to indicate our intentions as regards scrapping the older ships, and, in the opinion of the Admiralty, it would be impossible satisfactorily to defend a policy of scrapping so many (actually 6) of our ships as would be involved in reducing to 16 at a time when His Majesty&apos;s Government are pressing on with rearmament at full speed.24. It is, indeed, quite probable that the view may be taken that we should maintain the maximum number of 22 ships in order to preserve what could be represented as a two-Power standard vis-a-vis Germany and Japan. It is con-r sidered, however, that the advantages to be obtained from a reduction to 19 ships set out above are definite, and that when comparative strengths are considered as opposed to comparative numbers, the situation resulting from that course. cOuld be defended as giving the best security at our command.Admiralty Recommendations.25. It is therefore proposed to give Germany the figure representing the tonnage of 19 ships at the end of 1942, calculating the figure on the assumption that the 1938 programme ships have completed by that date (see Table G -attached). If those ships are completed our capital ship strength at the end of 1942 would consist of : 2 1938 Programme.   (New ships.)3 Anson Class.   (New ships.)2 King George V Class.   (New ships.)2 Nelson Class.   (Post-war construction.)3 &quot;Warspite Class.   (Fully modernised.)Hood.   (Post-war construction.)Renown.  (Fully modernised.)Repulse.   (Partly modernised).2 Barham Class.   (Partly modernised.)2 Royal Sovereign Class. (One partly modernised, one not modernised). Total 19 Ships, two of which may be in hand for long refit and alterations.Admiralty, S.W. 1, October 17, 1938.
APPENDIX.The actual wording of the 1935, 35 per cent. Agreement, and of the declara-tion accompanying the 1937 Anglo-German Treaty, are not exactly applicable to the present situation.Article 3 (2) of the declaration states :  &apos;&quot; If the German Government should at any time find that the total tonnage available in a given category on the basis of the 35 per cent, ratio is not exactly divisible by the figure of the maximum standard displacement permitted by treaty for individual vessels in that category, it shall, subject to the limitations and conditions set out below, have the right to effect an adjustment of tonnage; provided :  (i) That the German Government shall give prior notification to theGovernment of the United Kingdom of its intention to exercise this right.(ii) That the extent and duration of the proposed adjustment shall formthe subject of discussion between the two Governments.(iii) That in no case shall the adjustment be such as to cause the german fleet to exceed the 35 per cent, ratio by more than half the maximum standard displacement permitted by treaty for an individual capital ship, and(iv) That the maximum duration of any particular adjustment shall notbe more than ten years from the date of the notification mentioned under (i) above.&quot;2. The situation at the end of 1942 if we retain nineteen ships is that Germany will have &quot; available &quot; a surplus tonnage of 72,700 tons. On this she could clearly build her fifth large capital ship &quot; H &quot; of 35,000 tons and another similar vessel, but the surplus then remaining of 2,700 tons, even with the maximum permissible adjustment added, would not give her enough tonnage for any further large capital ship.3.   Also, since her 72,700 &quot;available&quot; tonnage is less than twice the-maximum tonnage of an individual capital ship (45,000 tons), we might fairly maintain that she is not enititled to any adjustment for a third ship.4. If, however, we retain twenty ships, Germany will have &quot; available &quot; a surplus tonnage of 83,000 tons. On this she could (without using any adjustment) build 2 battleships similar to &quot; H &quot; of 35,000 tons and ask for an &quot; adjustment &quot; of 22,000 tons in order to complete a. further battleship of 35,000 tons. Although we could use the argument set out in paragraph 3 above, we might find her request difficult to resist as regards 1942; in subsequent years as our old battleships are replaced by larger ones the amount of surplus tonnage &quot; available &quot; will increase and the amount of adjustment required by Germany to complete this additional ship will decrease, and we should certainly be unable to resist the demand.5. To sum up, if we announce 19 ships at the end of 1942, Germany could hardly claim to lay down more than 2 more ships; if we announce 20 ships she might claim 3 more ships, and we might find the claim difficult to resist. If subsequently our figure at the end of 1943 was announced as 20 ships, the total tonnage being larger than in 1942, we should find the German claim to 3 ships, impossible to resist.* This represents a total of 19 ships, those of the 1938 programme being of 40,000 tons.Note.
