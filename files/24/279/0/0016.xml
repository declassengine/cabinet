THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,SECRET. COPY NO. 4 5CP.  216 (38)CABINET.INSURANCE LEGISLATION. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. The principal law governing insurance business in this country is the Assurance Companies Act,  1909,      It is now in some respects out of date and it contains certain defects, more particularly in affording inadequate protection to life policy-holders and in exempting mutual indemnity associations from all or many of the obligations imposed on insurance , companies.      It was not designed to meet the case of compulsory insurance,  the principle of which was introduced by the Road Traffic Act,  1950,  in regard to motor vehicle insurance, by the &quot;workmen&apos;.s Compensation. (Coal Mines) Act, 1934,  in regard to workmen&apos;s compensation insurance in the coal industry and by. the Air Navigation Act, 1936,  in regard   to   third party aircraft insurance.2. A Committee was appointed in 1924 by the then President v of the Board of Trade, under the Chairmanship of Mr. A.C. Clauson, K.C.   (now Lord Justice Clauson) to enquire and report what amendments were desirable in the Assurance Companies Act, 1909.      The Committee reported in 1927 &apos; (cmd. 2820).3. In February,  1936 the introduction of the compulsory principle rendered a further review desirable and my predecessor appointed a Departmental Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Felix Cassel    to consider what changes in the existing law relating to the carrying on of the business of insurance were
191 JL &amp; a desirable in the light of statutory provisions relating to compulsory insurance against third party risks and by employers agaanst liability to their workmen.    The Committee reported in July, 1937 (Cmd.5528).4.   Amending legislation is overdue.    It has hitherto been delayed not only by differences of opinion within the insurance industry and the difficulty of carrying through Parliament a complicated measure concerning which the interests were not in agreement, but also by the introduction of the compulsory principle.    The Cassel Committee&apos;s Report and further discussions with the interests concerned have now made it possible to prepare a Bill which should he of a non-controversial nature,&apos; and I accordingly ask for authority to prepare a Bill on the lines indicated below with a view to introduction next session.5.    In regard to compulsory insurance, the Bill could follow the main conclusions of the Cassel Committee, as follows(1)    No insurer would be allowed to transact any class of compulsory insurance business unless licensed to do so by the Board of Trade, under a system of control which in practice would be exercised largely by the insurance interests themselves through advisory committees set up by the Board of Trade, the ultimate responsibility resting with the Department.(2)    All insurers transacting compulsory insurance would be required to make full returns of their business to the Board of Trade.    This requirement would apply to mutual indemnity associations and&apos;also (subject to certain special adaptations) to Lloyd&apos;s.
1 9 9jL Cti w(3) A Central Fund contributed to by all insurers licensed to transact compulsory motor vehicle insurance would be&quot;&quot; set up for the purpose of meeting valid third party claims for which insurers are not liable by reason that a policy was obtained by fraud or that the conditions subject to which it was issued have not been observed.    The Central Fund would also be available to meet third party claims where the motorist was uninsured or in the (unlikely) event of the insolvency of a licensed insurer.    The contribution to the Central Fund per policy would be very small.An analogous Central Fund was recommended for aircraft insurance but not for workmen&apos;s compensation insurance where the position is widely different,,    (The insurance provisions of the Air navigation Act, 1936, however, are not yet in force,)6*    In consequence of their consideration of the questions connected with compulsory insurance, the Cassel Committee stressed the necessity of giving effect to certain important recommendations made by the Clauson Committee,    I therefore propose to provide in the Bill for the following points:-(l) The Life Fund,    Assets relating to life and other classes of insurance business involving permanent : contracts would be effectively separated from the assets relating to other business.    This point to which the insurance interests attach great importance, to 4 emphasised by the failure of the London General Insurance Company Limited on account of its motor vehicle business*    The life funds were used to
9 0support this business;    and the failure of the company caused serious loss not only to motor vehicle policy-holders and third parties who failed to obtain their compensations, but also to the company1s life policy-holders.(2) Mutual Indemnity Associations.      Ihe Olauson Committee recommend that mutual indemnity associations transacting workmen&apos;s compensation insurance should be required to furnish returns of their business in the same way as insurance companies and ought to be subject to the same control as such companies.      This had been the conclusion of the Holman Gregory Committee on Workmen&apos;s Compensation, which reported in 1920;, (Cmd.816), .and it was recommended by the Cassel Committee.     Whatever may be the outcome of the deliberations of the forthcoming Royal Commission on Workmen&apos;s Compensation, it is, in my view, essential from the insurance point of view that this recommendation should be carried out.      When, in 1934, the . Bill to make workmen&apos;s compensation compulsory in the coal-mining industry was before Parliament anxiety was expressed as to the financial position of the mutual indemnity associations.     The Government spokesman promised that careful consideration would be given to the question of bringing such associations within the scope of the Bill dealing with insurance business generally which the Government were then contemplating.  .(3) Deposits.     The Cassel Committee endorsed the broad conclusion reached by the Clauson Committee that the deposit made by an insurer is of comparatively little value as a guarantee to policy-holders and should be regarded as caution . I money on.y.     They accordingly recommended that no insiirer &apos; should be required to deposit more than  20.000Snd should have the
deposit returned to him as soon as he attained a sufficient standard of solvency.      The recommendation is one to which the insurance interests themselves attach considerable importance on grounds of principle and I am in full accord with their views.7. There are, however,  three matters on which, after consultation with the insurance interests, I have come to the conclusion that there is no sufficient case for adopting the Olauson re commendations:-(l) The Committee recommended that Marine and other classes of insurance business not now subject to control should be brought under control.    While, in the case of life or even fire or motor vehicle business, it is arguable that special supervision is necessary for the protection of the policy-holder, this is not the case with marine business as those effecting contracts of marine insurance are well able to look after themselves in selecting their insurers.    A company which transacts marine business in addition to classes such as life and fire which are of general importance, has to make&apos; full returns of its marine business, so that in such cases the safeguard of publicity exists.(2) Industrial Assurance.    A Departmental Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Farmoor, reporting in 1920 (Cmd. 614) recommended that industrial assurance should form a separate class of assurance business for the purposes of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909.    This recommendation would require companies transacting such business to make a separate deposit of  20,000 and to
X&apos; 2 c)show separately from the other assets of the company in the balance sheet the assets of the industrial, life assurance and annuity funds.     The Industrial Assurance Act, 1923, however, although &quot;it provided that industrial assurance should be a separate class of assurance business with a separate deposit and also with a separate fund, did not entirely separate the industrial assets from the other assets.The Glauson Committee recommended that the industrial assets should be separated, not only from the general assets, but also from the ordinary life assets.      The insurance interests have represented that it is not necessary or desirable for the industrial assets to be separated from the life assets.     I am not satisfied that further separation of the industrial from the ordinary life assets would be any safeguard for the industrial policy holder;    and the Industrial Assurance Commissioner sees no sufficient reason to take such a step in connection with the present legislation.    I propose that the accounts of the industrial business should continue to be kept apart from, those of the ordinary life business, and for the rest to give effect to the wishes of the companies in this matter.     If there should be any strong pressure (which I do not anticipate) for reverting to the Clauson recommendation in this respect, the matter is one ?/hich could be reconsidered.(3) Employers&apos; Liability Fund.      Lastly, the Clauson Committee recommended that the assets of employers&apos;  liability business should be entirely separated from the assets of all other business, or, as they put it, that employers&apos; ^ liability business should have a separate statutory fund of its own with separate assets.      The Cassel Committee have pointed out that this class of business is more properly assimilated to the classes not involving permanent contracts as the insurer has the right to terminate the contract of
insurance, whereas in the case of life assurance, for example, he has not.      I propose to follow the Gassel,  and not the Clauson,  recommendation in this matter.0*3?. G. Sj.Board of Trade,13th. October,  1938.
