THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1938.SECRET. ^ Copy No. 48CP. 224 (38).CABINET.CREATION OF A WAR POTENTIAL FOR AIRCRAFT PRODUCTIONIN CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.ON the 29th June the Cabinet considered a memorandum by myself (OP. 143 (38)) and the conclusions (OP. 148 (38)) of a conference of Ministers which had examined that document. Approval was given to the despatch to Canada of a Mission with the primary purpose of negotiating ad referendum a scheme for the production of large bomber aircraft. The scheme contemplated was one for the creation of a potential capable of providing aircraft in war rather than for the early production of aircraft in peace. Such a scheme, it was felt, would give us a valuable resource in war beyond the range of enemy aircraft; would operate in peace to diminish the tendency in Canada to detachment from concern with imperial defence; and would immediately impress opinion on the Continent.The Mission, which was headed by Sir Hardman Lever, has succeeded in negotiating a scheme on the lines contemplated. Copies of the Report of the Mission have been sent to the Ministers of Departments immediately concerned, and I will refer here only to aspects which require Cabinet authority.Broadly, the investigations of the Mission show that it is possible to create in Canada a potential which would be capable of being gradually developed in war to a capacity of 500 large bomber aircraft per annum. The Canadian aircraft industry is, however, embryonic and the Mission decided that an educational order would be desirable before manufacture was attempted on the large bomber types which are now in the design stage. It will be recalled that doubts had previously been expressed on the desirability of embarking on manufacture of the large types from the outset and the Mission had been instructed to arrange for an educational order for aircraft of the Hampden type as a preliminary to the main scheme, if these doubts were confirmed. The immaturity of the Canadian aircraft industry is even greater than had previously been supposed and the Mission concluded that it will need a larger educational order than had been originally contemplated, and one spread over a longer period, in order to attain to efficiency in production. The industry, reorganised as proposed, should be capable of completing an educational order for 80 Hampden aircraft by the end of 1940 and thereafter of carrying out during 1941 and 1942 the construction of perhaps 100 large bombers of the most modern design. The placing of this order would, however, be subject *to the conditions obtaining at the time and no present commitment is involved. The aim with which we sent the Mission to Canada can therefore be fulfilled, though the potential we desired to create will not be available before 1941.The immediate financial commitment would be limited to the cost of the 80 Hampden aircraft, which is estimated at  1,300,000. This cost is approximately the same as is estimated for a like educational order recently placed with the English Electric Company in this country and is about  300,000 in excess of the&apos; estimated cost if the parent firm, Handley Page, Ltd., undertook the order[18064]
on the basis of subcontracting which is now called for as a normal condition of manufacture in England. The order would be an addition to the present programme of aircraft production.No further liability accrues under the scheme beyond this initial order except that compensatory payments might arise in respect of the maintenance of the manufacturing capacity so created over a period of ten years, during which a lien on output would be secured for the United Kingdom. This contingent liability, assuming no further orders, would be about  100,000. It will not materialise in so far as supplementary orders are given. The total financial liability which the scheme entails is less than that which I estimated prior to the despatch of the Mission.In inviting the approval of the Cabinet to my entering into these commit-ments, I must refer to a somewhat difficult question of imperial relations which my proposals raise. The purpose of the scheme described is to provide capacity for aircraft production in war and this purpose would be frustrated if, in correspondence with the doctrine of neutrality current in the United States, the Canadian Government were in time of war to refuse to allow the capacity to be used.This political issue was, of course, not one for the Mission, but they were impressed with the cordial co-operation offered to them by the Canadian Ministry of Defence. The Canadian Prime Minister was informed, through the High Commissioner, of the progress made by the Mission, and invited to concur in a press communique to be issued when the members of the Mission left Canada. Mr. Mackenzie King proved willing to agree to the communique only after amendments had been made designed to emphasise that his Government was in no way involved in the arrangements contemplated, which would be made directly between the United Kingdom Government and Canadian industry. He even objected to a reference to the delivery of the big bombers by air across the Atlantic as tending to suggest a restriction on the freedom of the Canadian Parliament to decide what action they would take in the event of war.It appears that the Canadian Government are in a position of political embarrassment in regard to this Mission, as also in regard to that which had visited Canada at the same time to discuss the training in Canada of pilots for the Royal Air Force. On the one hand the proposals are feared as likely to prejudice the &quot; neutrality &quot; of the Dominion, whilst on the other hand there are strong advocates for support for such measures of imperial co-operation. The scheme^ here discussed can, however, proceed successfully without any commitment on the part of the Canadian Government, and in my judgment it is desirable in existing circumstances that it should proceed on that basis. I do not think we can expect to obtain from the Canadian Government here and now a specific assurance that the production capacity which the scheme is designed to create will certainly be available to us in war. If political discussion in Canada should., result in the question being raised in Parliament we should reply that an assurance had neither been sought nor offered.In seeking the approval of the Cabinet to my entering into the agreement with the Canadian industry which this scheme contemplates, I would mention also two secondary matters dealt with by the Mission. These were within the Mission&apos;s instructions to discuss, but on the basis that His Majesty&apos;s Government-was in no way committed to them even in principle.The first relates to two Canadian companies whose factories are situated in Western Canada, and thus could not be brought within the principal scheme. These companies are each willing to create increased capacity, and to give the Air Ministry a lien upon its output for ten years in return for a single order without subsequent commitments. The total of the proposed orders would not exceed 40 Fighter aircraft and 20 General Reconnaissance aircraft (or equivalent types), v and the total cost would be within  500,000. This sum might exceed the cost of production here by  100,000, but, in return for this, valuable potential capacity would be created. In the Mission&apos;s view, the omission of any representatives of Western Canada from the Air Ministry&apos;s plans would have an adverse effect Upon Canadian opinion, and I would ask the approval of my colleagues to the conclusion of agreements as indicated above, subject to the satisfactory settlement of the&apos; types to be made and the prices to be paid.The second matter relates to engine production in Canada.    The Mission made only a general investigation into this matter, but they were hopeful that a
group scheme could be formulated, analogous to that proposed for aircraft, capable of a potential in war sufficient to provide the engines for the bomber aircraft to be built under the main scheme. I would invite the approval of the Cabinet to sending an Air Ministry engine expert to Canada to make a detailed investigation, but without in any way committing His Majesty&apos;s Government. In sum my proposals a*re :  - ,(1) That an educational order for 80 Hampden aircraft at an approximate cost of  1,300,000 should be placed, coupled with the execution of an agreement for the effective maintenance and development over a period of 10 years of the manufacturing capacity so created.(2) That this action should be taken without any attempt at the present time to secure an assurance from the Canadian Government that the productive capacity thus created would certainly be available to this country in war.(3) That orders for a maximum of 40 fighter aircraft and 20 general recon-naissance aircraft (or equivalent types) (at an approximate cost of  500,000) should be placed with firms in Western Canada.(4) That an Air Ministry engine expert should be sent to explore the possibilities of a Group Scheme on a modest scale for producing aero-engines in Canada, but without in any way committing His Majesty&apos;s Government.I think we are greatly indebted to Sir Hardman Lever and his colleagues for their successful conduct of this complex and difficult undertaking, and I should like to convey to them an appropriate expression of the appreciation of His Maiesty&apos;s Government.K. W.Air Ministry, October 13, 1938.
