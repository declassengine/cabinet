CRET.ft 9F.329(38). COPY NO._* -C A B I N E T. Prevention of Fraud (investments) Bill.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.It was decided at the end of July,  (Cabinet 33(38), Conclusion 9) that the Prevention of Fraud (investments) Bill should be introduced in the House of Commons before the Recess, with a view to its consideration by the financial and commercial interests concerned and its reintroduction,  as early as practicable, next Session.    It will be recollected that this course appeared to be desirable in view of the difficulty of drafting a measure which would prevent fraud in share dealing and similar matters without at the same time hampering legitimate and necessary activities.The Bill has been favourably received.    A few criticisms and suggestions of a minor or drafting nature which have been made for improving it and for meeting special points of difficulty are under departmental consideration.    I propose to consult the Attorney General on them,.but none is of sufficient importance for me to trouble my colleagues.There will undoubtedly be pressure for proceeding with the legislation and I ask,  therefore, for authority to re-introduce the Bill as soon as possible after Parliament meets, with such amendments as may prove necessary to meet the points at present under consideration,% . ^ O.F.G.S.Board of Trade,20th October, 1938.
