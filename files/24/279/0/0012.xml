CZECHOSLOVAKIA.THE MUNICH AGREEMENT.Note by the Secretary.The Prime Minister has instructed me to circulate to his colleagues the accompanying Memorandum setting out the main differences between the Munich Agreement and the Godesberg Memorandum.The texts of the Godesberg Memorandum and of the Munich Agreement are appended.(Signed) E.E. BRIDGES. Secretary to the Cabinet.6* Richmond Terrace, S.W.I. 1st October,, 1938.SECRET. CP. 212 (58).
hottjS on the main differences between tks Munich agreement and the GOdbsberg MEUQpJSlDTOji.1, The Godesberft Memorandum, though cast in the formof proposals, was in fact an ultimatum with a time-limit of six days.The Munich Agreement now accepted by the Czechoslovak Government, reverts to the Anglo-French plan (which is referred to, though not in express terms, in the preamble), and lays down the conditions for the application - on the responsibility of the Four Powers and under international supervision - of the main principle of that memorandum,,2. Under the ivlunich Agreement the evacuation of theterritory to be occupied by the German military forces and its occupation by those forces is to be carried out in five clearly defined stages between 1st October and 10th October (Article 4), instead of having to be complete in one operation by 1st October,,3* The line up to which the German troops will enterinto occupation is no longer the line drawn by Herr Hitler as laid down in the map attached to the Godesberg Memorandum but is a line to be fixed by an International Commission on which both Germany and Czechoslovakia are represented,, (Article 4*)4. Under the Godesberg Memorandum the areas on theGzjech side of the Hitler line which were to be subjected to plebiscite were laid down by Germany in the map, while those on the German side of that line were left undefined.
Under- the Munich AgTeement, all plebiscite areas will he defined &quot;by the International Commission (Article 5) o     Tire &quot;green areas&quot;, therefore, like it he Hitler line itself, disappear^     The criterion is to be the &quot;predominantly German character&quot; of the areas concerned, the interpretation of which is left to the Commission,, The Hitler line took in some areas which were certainly not of a &quot;predominantly German character&quot;Q5. The Godesberg Memorandum provided for theoccupation of plebiscite areas by Cferman and Czech forces (as the case might be) up,.no. the time of the plebiscite and their evacuation by those forces during the plebiscite^Under the M&apos;taich Agreement, the plebiscite areas are occupied at once by an international force (Article 5).6, The Munich Arrangement,by stating (Article 5)that the plebiscite is to be based on the conditions of the Saar plebiscite, indicates that the vote is to be taken by small administrative areas such as communes.The Godesberg Memprjmdum did not indicate on what kind of areas the vote would be based;, and gave rise to fears   on the Czech side that the possible insistence by Germany on large areas might work to the disadvantage of Czechoslovakia,7, The Czech Government, while bound under thet Munich Arrangement to carry out the evacuation of the territories without damaging &quot;existing installations&quot; (Article 2), Is not placed, under the oppressive and
humiliating conditions of the appendix to the Godesberg Memorandum, which even provides that no foodstuffs, goods, cattle or raw materials are to be removed.Under the Munich Agreement, the conditions of evacuation (Article 3) are to be laid down in detail by the International Commission, which will no doubt do its best to secure fair terms for the Czechs,     Under the G odesberg Memo ran dum the detailed arrangements for the evacuation were to be settled between Germans and Czechs alone,8, Unlike the Godesberg Memorandum, the MunichAgreement has provisions as regards (a) right of option (Article 7);    (b) facilitating transfer of population (Article 7);    (c) all other questions arising out of the transfer of the territory (Supplementary Declaration); and also (d) gives the Czechs a period of four weeks for -the release of Sudeten Germans from army and police, and for the release of Sudeten-German political prisoners,9, The Annex to the Munich A.rreement gives the czechoslovak State an assurance of the joint guarantee by the United Kingdom and Prance of their new boundary against umprovoked aggression.     It thus gives the Czechs an essential counterpart which was lacking In the Godesberg Memorandum.     Germany and Italy also undertake to give a guarantee when the question of Polish and Hungarian minorities has been settled.10, Finally, there is a Declaration by the Four powers that if the problems of the Polish and Hungarian minorities in Czechoslovakia are not settled within three months by agreement between the respective Governments, another Four-Power meeting will be held to consider them.
ANNEX A.The Godesberg Memorandum. ,Memorandum handed by the Reichschancellor to the Prime Minister on September 23, 1938 (with a Map).(Translation.)Ebpoets which are increasing in number from hour to hour regarding incidents in the Sudetenland show that the situation has become completely intolerable for the Sudeten German people and, in consequeiice, a danger to the peace of Europe. It is therefore essential that the separation of the Sudetenland agreed to by Czechoslovakia should be effected without any further delay. On the attached map(-.) the Sudeten German area which is to be ceded is shaded red. The areas in which, over and above the areas which are to be occupied, a plebiscite is also to be held are drawn in and shaded green.The final delimitation of the frontier must correspond to the wishes of those concerned. In order to - determine these wishes, a certain period is necessary for the preparation of the voting, during which disturbances must in all circumstances be prevented. A situation of parity must be created. The area designated on the attached map as a German area will be occupied by German troops without taking account as to whether iii the plebiscite there may prove to be in this or that part of the area a Czech majority. On the other hand, the Czech territory is occupied by Czech troops without regard to the question whether, within this area, there lie large German language islands, the majority of which will without doubt avow their German nationality in the plebiscite.With a view to bringing about an immediate and final solution of the Sudeten German problem the following proposals are now made by the German Government  -1. Withdrawal of the whole Czech armed forces, the police, the gendarmerie, the customs officials and the frontier guards from the area to be evacuated as designated on the attached map, this area to be handed over to Germany on the 1st October.2. The evacuated territory is to be handed over in its present condition (see further details in appendix). The German Government agree that a plenipotentiary representative of the Czech Government or of the Czech Army should be attached to the headquarters of the German military forces to settle the details of the modalities of the evacuation.3. The Czech Government discharges at once to their homes all Sudeten Germans serving in the militaiy forces or the police anywhere in Czech State territory.4. The Czech Government liberates all political prisoners of German race.5. The German Government agrees to permit a plebiscite to take place in those areas, which will be more definitely defined, before at latest the 25th November. Alterations to the new frontier arising out of the plebiscite will be settled by a German-Czech or an. international commission. The plebiscite itself will be carried out under the control of an international commission. All persons who were residing in the areas in question on the 28th October,. 1918, or were born there prior to this date will be eligible to vote. A simple majority of all eligible male and female voters will determine the desire of the population to belong to either the German reich or to the Czech State. During the plebiscite both parties will withdraw their military forces out of areas which will be defined more precisely. The date and duration will be settled by the German and Czech Governments together.6. The German Government proposes that an authoritative German-Czech commission should be set up to settle all further-details.Godesberg, September 23, 1938.(2) See at the end of this Paper a sketch map based upon the original.[17984]

The remaining territory of preponderantly German character will be ascertained by the aforesaid international commission forthwith and be occupied by German troops by the 10th of October.5. The international commission referred to in paragraph 3 will determine the territories in which a plebiscite is to be held. These territories will be occupied by international bodies until the plebiscite has been completed. The same commission will fix the conditions in which the plebiscite is to be held, taking as a basis the conditions of the Saar plebiscite. The commission will also fix a date, not later than the end of November, on which the plebiscite will be held.6. The final determination of the frontiers will be carried out by the international commission.
