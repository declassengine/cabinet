Printed for the Cabinet, November, 1938Copy No.   50THE CABINETPROVISION OF A PRACTICE RANGE FOR ARMOURED FIGHTING VEHICLES AT LINNEY HEAD, PEMBROKESHIREMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. The provision of a range for the training of units equipped with armoured 43fighting vehicles is urgently necessary.  Reconnaissances have been carried out all Tankover Great Britain and I am advised that the only possible site which meets 496 requirements is one of 6,000 acres at Linney Head, Pembrokeshire.2. The&apos; cost of purchase is approximately  250,000. Representations have been made to me that the acquisition of this site will involve tq some extent interference with agriculture and amenities. The matter was discussed at a meeting of the Treasury Inter-Service Committee on 6th October, 1938, at which representatives of the War Office and the Ministry of Agriculture were present.3. The Treasury agreed that on financial grounds the War Office case for the acquisition of this site had been made out. They pointed out, however, that, regard being had to the conflicting interests involved, it would be for myself or the Cabinet to decide whether the site should in fact be purchased. As some of my colleagues have expressed interest in the proposed acquisition of the Linney Head site and, in view of the possible unfavourable reaction of the public to such acquisition, I thought it right to inform my colleagues, in advance of any further announcement, of the intention to purchase this site to which no reasonable alternative seems possible.   A more detailed note is appended.L. H.-B.The War Office,4th November, 1938APPENDIX1. The provision of a new practice range for units equipped with armoured fighting vehicles has become a matter of urgency, owing to the large increase in the number of armoured lighting vehicle and cavalry mechanized units.At p/resent the only armoured fighting vehicle range existing is at Lulworth, and this range is completely inadequate for the training of all the units requiring annual practice, and at the same time it provides no facilities for battle practice for units armed with the 2-pdr. gun. A comprehensive-sive reconnaissance has accordingly been carried out all over England, Wales and Scotland, with a view to finding an area suitable for a new range, particular attention being given to all suggestions put forward by interested parties. After full consideration it has been decided that the only suitable site is an - area of approximately 6,000 acres at Linney Head, Pembrokeshire, which forms part of the estate of Lord Cawdor. The Board of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have been consulted, see paragraph 3 below.SECRET. CP. 244 (38).
2. An area of this size is the minimum which is necessary, and can only be kept to this minimum by reason of the fact that a sea danger area can be obtained ; if an inland range were to be con-structed, an area of at least 20,000 acres would be required. The reason for this is to be found in the nature of the weapons and vehicles with which personnel have to be trained. Range practices for armoured fighting vehicles include firing on the move the - 303-inch machine gun, the - 5-inch machine gun and the 3-pdr. or 2-pdr. service shell at ranges from 1,500 to 100 yards. Each range thus requires a manoeuvre area at leas^i^oo yards in depth, an area in which to instal moving targets, and a danger area. Moreover, in addition to exercising personnel in individual practices on these ranges, sub-units must be exercised in battle practice, which requires very much greater manoeuvre, target and danger areas.The site selected at Linney Head for a new armoured fighting vehicle range is the only area which adequately meets military requirements, and the cost of acquisition to cover all interests, and including compensation to tenants, has been estimated by the War Office Chief Land Agent and Valuer at  250,000.3. Representations in regard to the proposal have been made by interested parties, both local and national, and in particular by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. That Department has felt itself unable to support the War Office in this matter, in view of the fact that the site which has been chosen comprises a large area of good agricultural land, of which there is a very small proportion only in the Principality, and the sterilization of which, it is claimed, will have a harmful effect upon the interests of agriculture. The War Office, however, consider that in a case of this nature the claims of national defence must be regarded as paramount; no other site than Linney Head can be found which is of less value from an agricultural point of view, while at the same time adequately meeting military needs. Moreover, unless the site can be purchased, no arrangements can be made for the adequate training of armoured fighting vehicle units, and, unless early possession can be obtained, it will not be possible for more than 6 of the 17 armoured fighting vehicle units now in existence to carry out their practice camp training in 1939.(B38/8)    70   11/38   w.o.p.    2486 -
