THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).  . E C R E T.COPY NO.   14-J-j.P. 211(58).CAB I N E T0CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Copy of letter handed today to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by M.-, Masaryk on behalf of the Government of Czechoslovakia,,(Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,)23rd September, 19380Sir,My Government has instructed me just now, in view of the fact that the French statesmen are not arriving in London to-day, to bring to His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s notice the following message without any delay.The Czechoslovak people have shown a unique discipline and self-restraint in the last few weeks regardless of the unbelievably coarse and vulgar campaign of the controlled German press and radio against Czechoslovakia and its leaders, especially Mr. Benes.His Majesty&apos;s and the French Governments are very well aware that we agreed under the most severe pressure to the so-called Anglo-French plan for ceding parts of Czechoslovakia.     We accepted, this plan under extreme duress.     We had not even time to make any ^   representations about its many unworkable features.Nevertheless we accepted it because we understood that it was the end of the demands to be made upon us and because it followed from the Anglo-French pressure that these two Powers would accept responsibility for our reduced frontiers and would guarantee us their support in the
event of our being feloniously attacked.The vulgar German campaign continued.While Mr. Chamberlain was at Godesberg the following message was received by my Government from His Majesty*.s and the French representatives at Prague: &quot;We have agreed with the FrenchGovernment that the Czechoslovak Government beinformed that the French and British Governmentscannot continue to take the responsibilityof advising them not to mobilize&quot;.My new Government, headed by General Syrovy, declared that they accept full responsibility for their predecessors&apos; decision to accept the stern terms of the. so-called Anglo-French plan.Yesterday, after the return of Mr. Chamberlain from Godesberg, a new proposition was handed by His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Prague to ray Government with the additional information that His Majesty&apos;s Government is acting solely as an intermediary and is neither advising nor pressing my Government in any way.     Mr. Krofta in receiving the plan from the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Prague, assured him that the Czechoslovak Government will study it in the same spirit in which they have co-operated with Great Britain and France hitherto..My Government has now studied the document and the map.     It is a de facto ultimatum of the sort usually presented to a vanquished nation and not a proposition to a sovereign state which has shown the greatest possible readiness to make sacrifices for the appeasement of Europe.     Hot the smallest trace of such readiness for sacrifices has as yet been manifested by Mr. Hitler&apos;s Government.     My G0vernment is amazed
at the contents of the memorandum.     The proposals go far &quot;beyond what we agreed to in the so-called Anglo-French plan.     They deprive us of every safeguard for ou&quot;r national existence.     We are to yield up large proportions of our carefully prepared defences and admit the German armies deep into our country before we have been able to organize it on the new basis or make any preparations for its defence.     Our national and economic independence would automatically disappear with the acceptance of Herr Hitler&apos;s plan.     The whole process of moving the population is to be reduced to/&apos;panic flight on the part of those who will not accept / the German Nazi regime.     They have to leave their homes without even the right to take their personal belongings or, even in the case of peasants, their cow.My Government wish me to declare in all solemnity that Herr Hitler&apos;s demands in their present form are absolutely and unconditionally unacceptable to my Government..    Against these new and cruel demands my Government feel bound.to make their utmost resistance and we shall do so, God helping.      The nation of St. Wenceslas, John Hub and Thomas Masaryk will not be a nation of slaves.We rely upon the two great Western democracies, whose wishes we have followed much against our own judgment to stand by us in our hour of trial.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JAN MASARYK.
