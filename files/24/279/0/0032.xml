hi      JL(THIS    DOGU MENTIS    THE   PROPERTY   0 F HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJ E S T Y&apos;S    GOVERNMENT).SECRET. CP.232(33) .ESTABLISHMENT OF CANCER SERVICE.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister gjf Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland.1..    A Bill for the establishment of a cancer service making available modern facilities for diagnosis and treatment over the whole country was included under category B(II)   in the list submitted by the Home Affairs Committee to the Cabinet before the opening of last Session, with a note attached that consultation with the Treasury was necessary.     The Cabinet adopted the Committee&apos;s classification (Cabinet 36(37) Conclusion 11).     Further progress with the Bill in the last Session was impracticable, but the necessary consultation has -now taken place and the Treasury agree generally with the proposals outlined below.2.     The mortality rate from cancer has been rising steadily for many years.     At the present time cancer causes nearly 70,000 deaths a year and an incalculable amount of suffering, and we regard it as a matter of urgent public necessity that a sustained and organised attempt should be made to deal with this problem on the broadest national lines.Although the causation of cancer is still obscure, the great advances in the use of radium and 2-rays of late years have made the outlook more promising in the field of diagnosis and treatment.     The disease is curable if the growth is accessible and treatment is undertaken at a sufficiently early stage.      It is therefore vital to success that the necessary facilities should be easily available to all persons who are suspected of suffering from the disease,  and at the present time this is not so.     It is- reckoned that not more than one case of cancer out of every four in an accessible site,COPY   no       o  o   *   ir e   *  oCAB I N E T.
Q ft O 4 44 and less than that where the cancer is more deeply placed,  is given the chance of cure or substantial alleviation offered by the prompt application of methods based on the knowledge now at on? disposal.      This means that a very large number of cancer sufferers who could be cured are not being cured nor are having their suffering alleviated.The existing facilities are manifestly inadequate and the position is such as to cause serious disquietude. Outside London, whose needs are comparatively well met, there are 22 National Centres providing radium treatment in voluntary&apos; hospitals under the auspices of the Radium Commission.It is considered that the establishment of 12 additional treatment centres at least is urgently required in order to cover the needs of Great Britain.3.     The principal provision of the proposed Bill would be to lay on the major local authorities (in England, the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs - in Scotland of Counties and Large Burghs),   the obligation, after consultation with the local medical profession and other interests, to prepare and submit for the approval of the Minister - in Scotland the Secretary of State - a scheme for meeting their needs, having regard to the provision already made in the area by voluntary agencies.     The scheme would involve- (1)    the provision of consultation centres for diagnosticand follow-up purposes organised and staffed by theTreatment Centre; (2)    the provision,  either directly or through selectedvoluntary hospitals, of an adequate number of beds * for patients undergoing treatment;(3)    contributions towards the cost of establishment ofTreatment Centres, the travelling expenses of patients (with their attendants, if necessary)to and from the Centres, etc.
0^9&amp; ht eJThese proposals are in accordance with the views of the Radium Commission, and also would he favourably received by the leaders of the medical profession, so far as we have &quot;been able to ascertain their views&apos;in confidence.4*      The duties imposed by the Bill would involve contributions from the Exchequer as contemplated by Section 135 of the Local Government Act, 1929, and by Section 78 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act,  1929, towards the cost of a new public health service.      It will be necessary to provide for an Exchequer grant averaging 50 per cent, (as for the new midwives service), until the matter can be adjusted in the block grant.     The Exchequer contribution on this basis is- estimated at  300,000 per annum for England and Wales, and  50,000 for Scotland, when the service is in full operation, which would probably be some five years hence.     At a very rough estimate the charge on the Exchequer during the first year of the operation of the scheme would not exceed.  70,000.5.      In addition, the National Radium Trust requires  . finance, not only for the purchase of new supplies of radium, but also, and more immediately, for meeting commitments already incurred in respect of ,radium which they hold and use on loan.     This radium will shortly have to be paid for, and this, will cost some  90,000.     The Trust1s remaining resources are not sufficient to provide more than about 5 per cent, of that amount.It is clearly desirable that the supplies of radium should be kept under central control and we propose that the *   National Radium Trust should continue to be the authority for this purpose.      The total cost of the necessary radium for Great Britain would be about  500,000 spread over five years. Radium has a life of 2,500 years and is by its very nature an almost permanent investment.
6.      Under its existing Charter the Radium Trust (acting through an executive body, the Radium Commission) has power to lend radium to hospital authorities and charge a rent equivalent to the administrative expenses of handling the radium.     We suggest that,  if the necessary alteration of the Charter can be secured (a matter which we. are now exploring), or other suitable arrangements made, a sum should be advanced to the Trust from the Exchequer sufficient to enable the necessary new supplies of radium, including the radium mentioned in the preceding paragraph and now held by the Trust on loan, to be procured, and that the Trust should, be empowered to charge rents sufficient to cover the service of the loan.      On the basis of a 60-year loan period the loan charges would, amount to about  20,000 a year.7.     The Treasury, who have been consulted, agree generally with the proposals outlined above.     We should be glad to receive authority to proceed on the lines indicated.W. E. E. -J. C.28th October,  1938..
