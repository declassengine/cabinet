Paper No. 1465-B).2. As is explained in the Air Ministry&apos;s covering letter and in Appendix A to C.I.D. Paper No. 1465-B, in December last the Chancellor of the Exchequer was unable to approve the full proposals of the War Office and Air Ministry for gas provisioning (under which an expenditure of  3 millions was contemplated to provide a combined output of 520 tons a week, 90 per cent,  of which was for* R.A.P. use) until certain strategic and political aspects, to which he drew attention, had been considered by Ministers.3. Pending the consideration of these strategic andpolitical aspects,  the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in December -era&amp;%, authorised the immediate construction of a factory at Kemet with a capacity of approximately 170 tons a week.CABIN E T.THE MANUFACTURE OP TOXIC GAS FOR USE IN WAR.-1-

August 1938.SECRET.1465-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE MANUFACTURE OF TOXIC GAS FOR USE IN WAR. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1383-B.)Copy of a letter dated July 26, 1938, from the Air Ministry to the Secretary,Committee of Imperial Defence.(S. 44651/S. 6.) Sir,I AM commanded by the Air Council to refer to the minutes of the 115th Meeting of the Treasury Inter-Service Committee, Item 10 (Projected arrange-ments for Gas Manufacture). At this meeting of the Committee the Treasury representatives reported that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was unable to approve the full proposals of the War Office and Air Ministry for gas provisioning until certain strategic and political aspects to which he had drawn attention had been considered by Ministers.The enclosed memorandum dealing with the strategic and political aspects of the subject has accordingly been drawn up by the War Office and Air Ministry acting in collaboration, and the Council suggest that it could appropriately be considered in the first instance by the Committee of Imperial Defence.I am, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES EVANS.Copy No.   119Enclosure.Memorandum prepared by the War Office and the Air Ministry.1. The Government policy regarding the possible offensive use of gas was laid down in 1925, in the following terms* : &quot; (v) That all Service schools and commands be authorised to study the employment of offensive gas, since the study of offensive gas is necessary to the study of protection against gas, and also in order that we may be in a position to retaliate immediately should the use of gas be forced upon us by our opponents.(vi) That steps should be taken to ensure the bulk production of gas should necessity arise, and that stocks should be provided and held sufficient to bridge over the period required to bring the machinery of production into operation.&quot;2. For various reasons no action was taken to implement this policy until 1936, when, as a result of recommendations by the Committee of Imperial Defence, an interdepartmental committee was set up to. consider plans for producing, storing and filling the gas required for Army and Royal Air Force use. The conclusions of the Committee and the subsequent interdepartmental consideration of the problem provided the basis for a War Office Memorandum! recently* C.I.D./193rd Meeting, Minute 4. f Not reproduced.B[17666]
submitted to the Treasury Inter-Service Committee, which included proposals for the erection of two factories at a total cost of some  3,000,000 for the manufac-ture of mustard gas with a combined output of 520 tons a week, of which 470 tons (90 per cent.) was for R.A.F. use. One of these factories with an ultimate capacity of S50 tons a week was to be established at Kemet (Merseyside) where authority had already been obtained for the establishment of a &quot; pilot &quot; plant of 40 tons per week output capacity which is now nearing completion.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave personal consideration to the War Office proposals, and, while prepared to approve a limited amount of work being undertaken at the Kemet site, he was unable to agree to the proposals in full since (a) they involved, in his opinion, a political and parliamentary question, which should be brought before the Cabinet, and (b) because he wished also to raise the question whether, in the latest view, gas was, as compared with H.E. and incendiary bombs, as effective against the civil population.The Chancellor&apos;s views were conveyed to the Treasury Inter-Service Committee at their 115th Meeting, relevant extracts from the minutes of which are attached to this Memorandum as Appendix &quot;A.&quot; The present Memorandum has accordingly been prepared to deal with the political and strategic questions to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has drawn attention.1 -   4.   The main questions for consideration appear to be the following :  (i) Since gas will only be used by Us as a retaliatory measure, the extent ofour preparations for its manufacture and employment must be.conditioned by the degree of preparedness in possible enemy countries..What knowledge do we possess on this subject and does it justify us.in initiating immediate measures to enable us to retaliate if gas is used against this country ? (ii) Is gas in the latest view considered to be as effective against the civilpopulation as H.E. and incendiary bombs ? (hi) Assuming that an enemy has used gas against us, is gas the mostsuitable weapon with which to retaliate ? &apos;-(iv) What are the strategic considerations which should govern the amountof gas required for retaliatory purposes, and the proportion of our&apos;war effort which should be allotted to the gas offensive? (v) What will be the political reactions at home and abroad to our prepara-&apos; &quot;   ;    tions for the manufacture of gas ?In view of the very large proportion of the proposed gas output (90 per cent.) which is required by the Royal Air Force, it has been agreed to restrict considera-tion of these problems to the air aspect.Our Knowledge of German Preparations....... 5.   On the 23rd December, 1937, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defencecirculated to the Committee of Imperial Defence a note on Chemical Warfare,, enclosing an intelligence summary of the position of Gas Warfare Preparations in Germany up to the 25th November, 1937 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1383-B).   The recommendations of this paper were approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 307th Meeting.-   In paragraph 2 of his note the Minister says : &quot;In the present situation it seems essential that our defensive prepara-; :   tions in every field should be conditioned by, and as far as possible keep pace with, those of Germany.&quot;t  Germany then should be the &quot;yardstick&quot; with which to measure our own preparations for chemical warfare.6. It is clear from the intelligence summary attached to the Ministers note that Germany has made remarkable progress in her preparations for gas warfare,&apos; which are considerably ahead of this country. In particular, there has been a. considerable development in the technique of spraying mustard gas from aero-1 planes, and a glass bomb filled with mustard gas, probably for use from aero-3 planes, has been developed and large quantities are being ordered. Offensive gas units have been in existence in the German Army since 1936, the formation
of Mechanised Gas Battalions has already begun, pioneers are equipped with gas, and tanks are capable of disseminating gas. There is evidence that the German Government are assured of the ability of the I.G. Farben Industrie to manufacture an adequate wartime supply of toxic substance at short notice, and that their policy is to hold sufficient stocks of gas to bridge the period until the factories are producing in bulk. &apos;7. The conclusion to be drawn is that Germany is making the most thorough preparations for the employment of gas in war, and in this respect is very much ahead of this country. Furthermore, the form of her preparations shows that she will possess the ability (though not necessarily the intention) to employ gas against the civil population.The Characteristics of H.E. Bombs, Incendiary Bombs and Gas.8. High explosive bombs, incendiary bombs and gas provide the Royal Air Force with three weapons which are entirely different in their characteristics and limitations. To deal with question (ii) of paragraph 4 it is necessary to consider these differences.9. The principal air weapon is the high explosive bomb. This weapon can be used against a great variety of vital targets, and will cause dislocation and disorganisation far exceeding the actual destruction achieved.10. The primary function of the incendiary bomb is to spread the damage caused by high explosive. There are some targets susceptible to attack by the incendiary bomb alone, but their importance is likely to be limited. Thus the incendiary bomb is supplementary to the high explosive bomb.11. The most suitable gas for war purposes at present known is considered to be mustard gas. At normal temperatures this material is, in fact, a liquid which may be either sprayed from aeroplanes or dropped in bombs and containers.. The liquid causes severe blisters on any part of the body with which it comes in. contact and will burn through ordinary clothing material. It damages the lungs if inhaled and is liable to cause blindness. Mustard gas is a &quot; persistent &quot; liquid which may remain active in contaminated areas for several weeks under suitable climatic conditions. Persons passing through a contaminated area, or touching ja contaminated article, will themselves be contaminated. Foodstuffs, livestock and crops contaminated with mustard gas will be severely damaged and probably ruined.The use of Gas against the Civil Population.12. Turning now to the Chancellor&apos;s question summarised in question (ii) of paragraph 4, it must be clearly understood that direct attack on the civil population as such forms no part of our strategic policy. A different policy may be forced upon us by way of reprisal as the war develops, but our policy will be to direct our bomber attacks only against legitimate military objectives. The definition of such objectives is a problem of great difficulty. It is true that it will probably include many installations manned by civilian personnel and situated in populous areas, and attacks upon such targets are likely to involve heavy incidental damage to the civil population. But indiscriminate bombing with the object of inflicting moral and material damage and loss of civilian life forms no part of our war plans. As, however, we cannot be certain that an enemy will not resort to action of this sort, it is only prudent to ensure that we should be in a position to retaliate. Moreover, the result of sustained attacks even upon unquestionably legitimate targets in populous areas will be to produce consider-able interruption in the national life, and throw a serious strain on the morale of the community. Those in the immediate neighbourhood of targets being bombed are bound to suffer considerably, while their work will be subjected to constant interruptions. Repeated experiences of this kind will undoubtedly help to lower the national morale.13.   Gas may be employed in conjunction with high explosive bombs and incendiary bombs.   Used in this, way it extends the effect of the high explosive and the incendiary bombs by hampering the work of rescue, repair and fire [17666] B 2
fighting parties. Practical experience of this form of attack is happily non-existent, but from numerous experiments it is possible to form a reasonable forecast of its efficacy. A crowd of unprotected persons such as workmen leaving a factory might suffer even as much as 100 per cent, casualties if subjected to gas-spray attack from the air. Large areas can be contaminated and will remain a source of danger to all persons passing through until the difficult work of decontamination has been completed. Heavy and sustained attacks which include the use of gas might well, at the worst, render the life of the community intolerable and at best would cause the most serious interference with normal activities. An important factor in such attacks is the delay which occurs in the development of the effects of mustard gas, which will result in large numbers of people being left in uncertainty whether they have received an effective dose of the gas. The cumulative effect on the civil population of such attacks is likely to produce a profound deterioration of national morale. which in default of adequate counter preparations might well approach a state of panic.14. If a belligerent were to resort to a heavy and sustained offensive entailing the use of gas against an unprotected civil population, the result might be to bring all normal activities for the time being to a standstill. Protective measures are therefore a vital necessity and will throw a very heavy burden on the national resources. The possibility of gas being used against the civil population has already compelled the Government to provide gas masks for the entire population of the United Kingdom. Great numbers of decontamina-tion squads will be needed who will require large quantities of decontamination material for their work. Anti-gas measures therefore make considerable demands on the industry and man-power of the country.15.   If, therefore, high explosive, incendiary bombs and gas attack on the civil population were added to the effects of air bombardment of legitimate objectives, there can be little doubt that the resulting disorganisation and . demoralisation would be very serious indeed, even assuming the existence of organised A.R.P. measures.16. To summarise, therefore, gas, incendiary bombs and high explosive, are in no sense alternatives : rather are they complementary. The incendiary bomb extends the destructive effect of the high explosive bomb, while gas, if employed in conjunction with these weapons, will add seriously to the strain on the morale of the civil population. Furthermore, defence against gas will certainly necessitate the diversion of a considerable portion of the available man-power, effort and resources from offensive to defensive activities.The Retaliatory Value of Gas.17. It has already been stated that gas used in conjunction with high explosive bombs and incendiary bombs increases the effect of these weapons Gas must also be regarded as a potent weapon in itself. This is particularly noticeable in the effect of gas attack on land forces. High gas spray used against all echelons of an army in the field, with the exception of the foremost areas, will seriously reduce mobility. Apart altogether from any casualties which may be produced, considerable delay will be caused by the necessity for changing and decontaminating clothing, and for observing the necessary passive defence measures such as taking cover and wearing anti-gas clothing. An army subjected to frequent attack with high spray will suffer severe dislocation and loss of fighting value. Low gas spray attacks on concentrations of troops at base ports, entraining or embussing centres, or in columns on the march would produce considerable casualties. Add to these the contamination of areas through which t the troops have to pass, and the dislocating and delaying action of gas on an army in the field is likely to be very serious indeed. It is obviously imperative that we should be in a position to use gas from the air against the enemy ground forces immediately it is employed against our armies. If we are not in a position to do this, the advantage which will accrue to the enemy from the use of gas may well prove decisive.18. Gas can also be used with effect against Naval and Air Forces. The contamination of naval ports would cause considerable interference in the work
essential for the rapid turn round of ships, while gas attacks on aerodromes and aircraft in the open would cause delay and disorganisation, thus considerably reducing the operational effectiveness of an Air Force. From the above considera-tions it is clear that gas is a potent weapon for the attack of armed forces, inducing delay and seriously affecting fighting efficiency.f19. The above considerations determine the reply to question (iii). In war with a first class Power it must be assumed that a maximum effort in the air will be deployed from the outset. Should the question of retaliation against the use of gas by the enemy arise, therefore, the means could not be found to an increase of our bombing effort. On the other hand, it would be possible, as has been shown above, to increase the effectiveness of our air effort by employing gas in substitu-tion for a proportion of our high explosive and incendiary bombs. Quite apart, therefore, from the desirability from the point of view of morale of turning against the enemy the weapon he has chosen to employ, is the fact that there exist important tactical and strategic aims, which would be served by so doing.The Amount of Gas Required for Retaliatory Purposes.20. It has already been shown that high explosive bombs, incendiary bombs and gas are complementary weapons and that the best results are likely to be obtained when they are used to reinforce one another. To determine an appropriate basis of gas provisioning it is therefore necessary to decide upon the proportions in which the three weapons should be combined in order to obtain the optimum effect. A careful study of a wide range of possible objectives leads to the conclusion that the most suitable proportions are 25 per cent, of gas to 75 per cent, of high explosive and incendiary bombs. There are, of course, exceptions to this general rule. Against some targets it would be uneconomical to use gas. On the other hand, there are other targets, notably land forces in the field, presenting large numbers of persons and animals in open country, which are very vulnerable to heavy gas attack. A gas provisioning policy based on 25 per cent, of the bomb lift of the Air Force would, however, enable a comprehensive-sive range of targets to be engaged effectively with gas, and would permit heavy gas concentrations at frequent intervals against targets particularly vulnerable to this form of attack. The Air Force requirements in gas have, therefore, been based on this proportion, which when applied to the total bomb lift of the Metropolitan Air Force under Scheme &quot; F &quot; amounts to 470 tons a week. This is the quantity for which factory capacity was requested in War Office Memorandum^ No. 228.21. While the considerations referred to in paragraph 20 must, in default of practical experience of modern gas warfare, remain the strict basis of gas provisioning, it is appropriate that some indication should be given as to the priority which should be accorded to gas in relation to other defence requirements. In this connection the following factors may legitimately be taken into consideration.-(a) In view of the Government policy to refrain from the use of gas unless it is first used against us, it is necessary that any gas provided shall be additional to, and not in substitution for, H.E. and incendiary bombs. It. would be illogical to reduce our offensive or defensive . capacity in more important directions in order to include an ideal, scale of provision for a weapon which it is hoped will never be used. Gas provision is therefore a direction in which some risk might legitimately be taken.(b) Although a reduction in the amount of gas provided would limit the potential effectiveness against certain objectives of our air striking rorce, it would not reduce the total weight of attack which could be delivered.22. For these reasons some reduction in the standard basis of gas pro-visioning could be imposed without serious damage to the interests of defence. The extent of the reduction permissible is not easy to calculate, as once a.[17666]* Not reproduced.
reasoned basis of estimation is departed from it is difficult to know where tp draw the line. In all the circumstances, however, it is considered that the maximum possible reduction from the standard basis would be roughly 50 per cent.It is therefore suggested that an initial scale of gas provisioning should be accepted amounting to approximately one half the original estimate; that is to say a total output capacity of 300 tons per week of which 50 tons would be for Army use and 250 tons for the Royal Air Force. In order to provide this output it will be necessary for the Kemet Factory to be constructed and prepared to operate to the full capacity.23. A reduction of this order in the scale of gas provisioning will make it necessary to adjust the proportions of H.S. to H.T. gas manufactured; the former is suitable for bomb filling, but not for spray, while the latter, primarily required for spraying, could be used in bombs. The proportion proposed in War Office Memorandum No. 228 was 75 per cent. H.S. to 25 per cent. H.T. This proportion if applied to the reduced scale of gas provisioning now contemplated would place undesirable - operational restrictions on the employment of the weapon, which could, however, be removed by manufacturing the two forms in equal quantities.24. It will take some months to raise the output of the Kemet factory from peace to full war capacity. If, therefore, we are to be ready to use gas effectively immediately on the outbreak of war a reserve of some 2,000 tons will be necessary, for which storage capacity should be provided.25.. If these proposals are accepted, the gas available at the beginning of a war in which the enemy makes immediate use of gas should be sufficient to enable the majority of strictly military targets to be attacked with an adequate propor-tion of gas, and occasional heavy gas concentrations to be employed against the enemy land forces. There may not be sufficient gas, however, to enable it to be employed effectively against the enemy civil population should it be decided to take this retaliatory measure against a similar attack on our civil population.26. In view of the advances which Germany has made in her preparation for gas warfare, it is important that factory capacity to produce our own require-ments should be made available without delay. If we wait upon the event it will be too late, since the enemy will be in a position to bring a most potent weapon to bear against us and we shall be unable to retaliate with effect.The Political Considerations.27. There remains to be considered question (v), a political question which is approached with some diffidence. The following comments are, however, submitted :  The air raid precautions measures which the Government have found it necessary to initiate have required the formation of a special department at the Home Office, the expenditure of large sums of money, and the widest publicity embracing all sections of the community. These measures have included the manufacture of gas masks for the population and the issue of instructions for their use. Official pamphlets are on sale to the public explaining the precautions which householders should take to protect themselves and their families against gas. The nation has even been informed that special gas masks are being made for children. Public reaction to these grim realities, far from being alarmist or panicky, has until recently been somewhat apathetic. If the general public are so little affected by these far-reaching precautions, they are perhaps unlikely to be perturbed by the knowledge that we have the means of retaliating effectively should an enemy employ gas against us. Indeed, there seems some reason to expect that the knowledge would be welcomed. The provision of gas with which to reply to enemy attacks is, after all, a natural corollary to the provision of gas masks for our own protection.28. Reaction abroad to our preparations for manufacturing gas will depend upon the way in which it becomes known and the characteristics of the various countries. If the knowledge is confined to Governments and their military advisers, then it can do nothing but good. In the event of war such countries as Germany and Italy would be reluctant to initiate the use of gas because of the
reaction on their own nationals which our gas counter-offensive would produce. Positive knowledge that we did not possess gas, however, might have just the opposite effect, since the enemy might well be tempted to use it at the outbreak of war in the hope of gaining surprise and of forcing us into submission before we had time to develop our manufacturing resources. As pointed out earlier, these manufacturing resources cannot be developed quickly without preparation beforehand. The provision of. gas for our own retaliatory purposes should therefore act as a powerful deterrent against its employment by other nations at the outbreak of war.29. Should our preparations for the manufacture of gas become a matter of general knowledge abroad, world reaction may well follow the course it took when, the re-armament programme was announced. Doubtless it also would be regarded as a wise measure forming part of a general policy of re-armament which has already been welcomed as a powerful guarantee of peace. Dictator Governments may deliberately misrepresent our intentions and use it as a bogey with which to frighten their own people into further sacrifices in the cause of National.Defence. But the Governments will nevertheless know that should they engage in war with us, their best protection against gas will be to abjure the use of it themselves. Indeed, they may well be forced into making a public declaration of policy on the lines of our own.It is important, however, that our preparations should be kept secret until we are actually in possession of factory resources for the manufacture of gas. To say that we intend to manufacture gas to be used in retaliation would be dangerous. To say that we possess gas with which to retaliate should it be used against us, will be a powerful deterrent.Conclusions.30.   The conclusions reached in this paper may be summarised as follows : (i) There is no doubt that Germany is making very thorough arrangements for the provision of gas and its employment in war. She is well ahead of this country, and consequently it is necessary that measures should be initiated at once to enable us to retaliate, should gas be used against us in war.(ii) Gas is not alternative to, but complementary to the high explosive bomb and the incendiary bomb, and if used in conjunction with them will hasten the work of dislocating and disorganising the national life and demoralising the community.^iii) The employment of gas as well as high explosive and incendiary bombs would augment the effectiveness of our air offensive to a degree unattainable by other means..,(iv) Arguing from strategic considerations alone, it is concluded that the amount of gas required by the Metropolitan Air Force under Scheme &quot; F &quot; will be equivalent to 25 per cent, of the total bomb lift, -(v) A reduction of the standard basis of gas provisioning by approximately one-half could be accepted without vital damage to defence interests. This will leave a total output capacity of some 300 tons per week (including 50 tons for Army requirements) which should be provided at once. The proportion of this output capacity required by the Royal Air Force should be provided on a basis of 50 per cent. H.S. and 50 per cent. H.T. In view of the Government^ policy, the gas provided for the Royal Air Force must be additional to and not in substitution for, H.E. and incendiary bombs.-(vi) The output required should be ensured by the development of the Kemet Factory to that output capacity.(vii) Storage capacity should be provided for the 2,000 tons reserve supply of gas required to tide over the period during which the Kemet&apos; factory is being raised from peace to full war output, ^viii) All practicable means should be employed to accelerate the completion of passive defence measures in order to offset in part the reduction in our power to retaliate.
(ix) The production of gas for offensive purposes is a corollary to the provision of anti-gas measures. The knowledge that we possess gas to be used in retaliation will have a reassuring effect at home, and be a strong deterrent to its employment by -potential enemies abroad. Positive knowledge that we do not possess gas, however, is likely to be dangerous and to, encourage its use against us.Appendix A to Enclosure.Extract from the Draft Minutes of Treasury Inter-Service Committee MeetingNo. 115 on December 21, 1937.War Office. Projected arrangements for Gas Manufacture.Item 10.Mr. Barlow referred to the proposals in War Office Memorandum No. 228 for the erection of factory capacity for the manufacture of gas at a total cost of some  3 million, which had been considered by the Committee at the 114th Meeting, item 4, and reserved for submission to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The&quot; Chancellor had given the matter close personal consideration and had reached the following decisions.1. The proposal involved a political and Parliamentary question which, in the Chancellor&apos;s opinion, should come before the Cabinet.Hitherto our gas production had been represented to the public as being &apos;&apos; for defensive purposes,&quot; i.e.t in order that we might experiment how to protect our-selves. In July 1936 the Committee of Imperial Defence decided on a further-step, viz., the provision of gas to enable us to retaliate without delay and the-formation of a nucleus of production to be used in war if retaliation called for it.But under the present proposal the Kemet factory alone would produce 200 tons a week for the Air Ministry, i.e., preparations were being made for extensive gas attacks on the civil population in the enemy country. Such extensive prepara-tions could not hope to escape notice and would need to be justified on political grounds.2. The Chancellor also wished to raise the question whether, in the latest view, gas was, as compared with H.E. and incendiary bombs, as effective against, the civil population.3. In order to avoid delay the Chancellor was prepared to agree to the-following steps being taken at once in advance of the review of policy by Ministers : (a) The Chancellor authorised the immediate construction of a factory atKemet.(b) On the other hand he did not consider that provision should be made.in peace of four units with a total capacity of 250 tons a week.. In his opinion, as regards a substantial part of the factory (amounting to at least one 80-ton unit) peace-time construction should be confined to the provision of such services as would enable the factory to be.-rapidly completed in war.i    4.   In the opinion of the Chancellor any provision on a higher scale than, that indicated above would be bound to attract great public notice, and it was therefore essential that no further steps should be taken before the political, implications had been reviewed by the Cabinet.Mr. Stevens stated that the Secretary of State for Air had studied the^ discussion of this matter recorded in the minutes of the 114th meeting of the Committee, and had given instructions that the Committee should be informed/
that any proposal for a reduction in the scale of gas attack involved important strategic questions on which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, the Committee of Imperial Defence was. the appropriate body to take a decision.Mr. Barlow said thai, the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not dissent from the Secretary of State&apos;s view. The Chancellor desired, however, to emphasise that political as well as strategical questions were involved and that the political questions were of such importance as to require a Cabinet decision.Mr. Whitham drew attention to the terms of the Chancellors decision in favour of the immediate construction of a factory at Kemet on a reduced scale. He inquired whether that decision might be interpreted as authorising the War Office to enter into immediate commitments with Messrs. LOT Limited for the construction of the Kemet factory, provided that those commitments were reduced below the full scheme in War Office Memorandum No. 228, the amount of the reduction being an 80-ton unit or its equivalent. Mr. Barlow replied in the affirmative.The Committee agreed as follows : (1) The War Office should conclude arrangements forthwith with Messrs. LCI. Limited for the erection of the Kemet factory on the reduced scale authorised by the Chancellor; the Committee to be informed in due course of the nature and cost of the modified scheme.(2) The War Office and Air Ministry should consult together and decide on the procedure for bringing before Ministers the strategical and political questions outstanding.

Copy No.    4?COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 333r^ Meeting, held on October 6, 1938.W TV^ TV(6)-THE MANUFACTURE OF TOXIC GAS FOR USE IN WAR.(C.I.D. Paper No. 1465-B.)(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 307th Meeting, Minute 4.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a copy of a letter dated the 26th July, 1938, from the Air Ministry to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence, covering the Memorandum prepared by the War Office and the Air Ministry (C.I.D. Paper No. 1465-B).SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that the proposals contained! in the War Office and Air Ministry Memorandum for the provision of toxic gas for use in war had been under consideration for some time. The question of the manufacture of gas on the scale proposed was, of course, a matter for Cabinet decision, and the Memorandum had been drawn up with a view to setting out the strategic and political aspects of this question. It was desirable that early decision should be reached on the question whether we were to proceed with the manufacture of gas for two reasons first, because it would take 12 to 18 months for the proposed factory to get into full production, and secondly, because orders for the weapons for the use of gas could not be placed pending this decision.Referring to the summary of the Conclusions in paragraph 30 of the memorandum he called particular attention to the very thorough arrangements which Germany were making for the provision of gas and its employment in war (sub-paragraph (i)) and the fact that gas was not an alternative, but complementary to high explosive and incendiary bombs. To place us in a position to retaliate, if necessary, against the employment of gas against this country, the recommendation was made in sub-paragraph (v) that immediate steps should be taken for the provision of gas on an initial scale of 300 tons per week.SIR WARREN FISHER said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was prepared to agree to the immediate construction of the factory at Kemet. For the rest, the Chancellor thought that a second factory should not be set up, and that the question of the extent to which poison gas should be manufactured and used was a matter of policy for decision by the Cabinet.* Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed -(a) That the question of the policy to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment regarding the use of gas as a retaliatory measure in war was a matter for Cabinet decision.[18034-6]
(b) To endorse the conclusions recorded in paragraph 30 (i), (ii), (iii), (viii)and (ix) of the Memorandum, which were as follows: &quot; (i) There is no doubt that Germany is making very thorough arrange-ments for the provision of gas and its employment in war.   She is well ahead of this country, and consequently it is necessary ^    that measures should be initiated at once to enable us to retaliate, should gas be used against us in war.(ii) Gas is not alternative to, but complementary to the high-explosivebomb and the incendiary bomb, and if used in conjunction with them will hasten the work of dislocating and disorganising the national life and demoralising the community.(iii) The employment of gas as well as high-explosive and incendiary bombs would augment the effectiveness of our air offensive to a degree unattainable by other means.Ji, JJ, JA. ,V* M, M, JJ,* TV VP &quot;TV&quot; -7T TP TV(viii) All practicable means should be employed to accelerate the completion of passive defence measures in order to offset in part the reduction in our power to retaliate, (ix) The production of gas for offensive purposes is a corollary to the provision of anti-gas measures. The knowledge that we possess gas to be used in retaliation will have a reassuring effect at home, and be a strong deterrent to its employment by potential enemies abroad. Positive knowledge that we do not possess gas, however, is likely to be dangerous and to encourage its use against us.&quot;(c) To authorise the Departments concerned to take action forthwith : (a) To complete the Kemet factory so as to provide capacity for a weekly output of 300 tons (including 50 tons for army require-ments) (paragraph 30 (v) and (vi)).(b) To provide storage capacity for 2,000 tons reserve supply of gasrequired to tide over the period during which the Kemet factory is being raised from a peace to full war output (para-graph 30 (vii)).id) That, pending the Cabinet decision on the question of policy, no further factory for the manufacture of toxic gas should be- built.(e) To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to submit C.I.D. Paper No. 1465-B, together with the above Minutes, to the Cabinet.*Jt. -it- -ii. J&amp;. jf.   &apos;     .*Jv&quot; *n* &quot;Tv&quot; flr *JFRichmond Terrace, S.W. 1, October 6, 1938.
