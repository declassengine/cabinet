THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.K. 898.COPY NOCOMMITTE&apos;TEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE.STANDING SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE CO-ORDINATION OF DEPARTMENTAL ^CTION PRIOR TO THE OUTBREAK OF jAR.By direction of the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence we met to-day with instructions to make recommendations to the Cabinet as to the nature, extent and sequence of the action recorded in the Government War Book, and such modifications of it, as might he thought necessary to meet the situation which now confronts us.As sump.t ions.2. As a basis of our examination of this problemwe proceeded on the following asstunptiond:-(i)    Immediate war with Germany.(ii)    Full precautions against Italy.-(iii)    A watchful attitude towards Japan,-3. Until recently the &quot;-far Book provided only forthe measures that should, be taken: -(i)    After the formal institution of the Precautionary Stage;    and(ii)    After war had been declared, or broken out.REPORT.-Purpose of Meeting.
4, Most of the action required, in the PrecautionaryStage could not he kept secret.     It is therefore possible that any Government might hesitate to authorise its institution for fear of precipitating a crisis.5.       &quot;&quot;Last July plans were prepared., with the authority of the Committee of Imperial Defencesfor the immediate setting up in the event of a war?in which this country might &quot;be subjected, to air attack, of a Regional Organisation throughout the country.     in view of the rapidity with which air attacks can he launched, it became apparent that this Organisation could not be brought into being in time to meet the critical conditions of the initial period, unless certain preparatory measures could be put in hand before the formal institution of the Precautionary Stage.     It was therefore decided to introduce the innovation of a &quot;Preparatory Period&quot; into the scheme of our defensive preparations.     The conception of this Period is that only such measures should be taken therein as are unlikely to become generally known, or if known, to be-misinterpreted.6.        Our review of \7ar Book arrangements has shown, however,that there are a number of measures which can and should be taken, even before the formal institution of the &quot;Preparatory Period&quot;,     Such measures fall into two categories, namely:-(a) Those which can be taken on the authorityof the responsible Ministers.     Recent progress in regard to a number of these are details d in Annex I0(b) Those which require Cabinet decision.     Theseare detailed in Annex II together with our recommendations in regard to certain of them.
7o In Annex III we   set out the action involvedin the formal institution of the &quot;Preparatory Period&quot;.8. The measures which will require Cabinet decisionwhen tne situation is such that overt precautions are necessary are set out in Annex IV;    while some of the measures which will require consideration by the Cabinet after the War Stage has been reached are set out in Annex V.9..       We have been informed that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee have to-day submitted a Report in which they emphasise the absolute necessity for a Precautionary Stage of at least 48 hours, if the Navy, Army and Air -Force are to be on a war footing by the time that war breaks out.       This time margin is equally essential for the completion of the arrangements contemplated in this Report.Signed on behalf of the Committee NoFo.

AMEXII.MEASURES WHICH THE SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMEND FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE CABINET FORTHWITH IN ADVANCE OF THE FORMAL INSTITUTION OF THEPREPARATORY PERIOD,Serial * No.lcWar Book ReferenceoChap. I p.2,1Subject,Defence of the Suez Canal,To he raised by.First Lord, Admiralty,Connected C,I,D, Papers.Remarks.The Cabinet considers the question of putting into operation the plan for the defence of the Suez Canal including control of traffic.NOTE: .Action under the plan entails consultation with Egypt under Articles 6 and 7 of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the necessary procedure for this is embodied in the plan.     It is suggested that consultation with Iraq, which is also obligatory under the Anglo-Iraq Treaty, should be considered at the same time.     None of the principal steps laid down in the plan (&quot;Preparation for Canal Control,&quot; &quot;Canal Control,&quot; &quot;War&quot;) may be instituted without the authority of the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Admiralty have already taken preliminary steps to collect naval personnel required to be sent from the United Kingdom,jl.
Protection of Vulnerable Points.Formation of mobilisation &quot;pools&quot; at R.A.F. Stations.Issue of respirators to the general public.S/S for War.S/S for Air.Home Secretary.The protection of vulnerable points from sabotage in a sudden emergency is carried out in the first instance by Regular Army units.     If the National Defence Companies could be embodied now they would relieve the Army units for more arduous duties. The measure would involve a good deal of publicity.If this measure was taken in advance it would greatly facilitate Air Force mobilisation.     The Air Staff point out, however, that considerable publicity v/ould oe involved.The policy hitherto approved has been to hold back the public issue of respirators until the latest practicable stage.     It is now suggested that the policy should be changed and a start made with the issue of respirators.     There are indications that the public in some areas is expecting this step to be taken.THE SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMEND that a start should now be -made with the issue of respirators to the public.DO
Construction of trenches in paries etc.ico IHomeSecretary.Arrangements have been provisionally made with contractors in the London area to construct trenches to accommodate half a million persons within 48 hours.     This would necessitate the employment of s ome 70,000 to 80,000 men working in three shifts.     The supply of this labour is in the hands of the Ministry of Labour and should be practicable given sufficient time. But if the precautionary stage is short, it may prove impossible to complete the work before hostilities commence.     The measure is purely defensive in character and cannot be considered to have any offensive implication.     It would of course involve widespread publicity, but it would have a high morale value particularly in relation to those persons who will be required to stay in London by reason of their work.THE SUB-COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS that steps should be taken forthwith to construct trenches in London to accommodate half a million persons, and to arrange for Local Authorities in the provinces to take corresponding action.

Where it is possible, subject to the above restriction&apos;to adapt premises now, it should be done.The scheme for increased home production of food is ready and can be considered by the Cabinet at any time, Consideration in the Preparatory Period would relieve pressure on the Cabinet during the Precautionary Stage.-do-Similar considerations apply to such Defence Regulations as are now ready for approval.

W.1 para. 26.j C.I.D. 120-B paras. 54-58.The Cabinet considers the institution of the Precautionary Stage.,NOTE.The institution of this Stage involves the despatch of the Warning Telegram to British Authorities throughout the Empire and other precautionary measures, e.g., the manning of Post War Signal Stations and Coast Defences, the issue of the Proclamation for requisitioning shipping and the taking up of Auxiliaries for the Fleet, the protection of j  vulnerable points, routeing and control of Merchant Shipping and Civil Aircraft, and preparations for the control of Aliens. It does not automatically involve the mobilisation of the Fighting Forces, the institution of Censorship.     Separate decisions will, therefore, have to be taken by the Cabinet on these questions.NOTE.As regards the Warning Telegrams it will be necessary for the Cabinet to decide whether any reference to the probable attitude of Italy and/or Japan should be included.

If Parliament is not sitting the King makes (in respect of each Service to be mobilized) a Declaration that a case of Great Emergency has arisen, and proceeds to hold a Council at which the Proclamations etc., are dealt with as above.The Cabinet considers further measures in connection with the Home Security organisation and Air Raid Precautions. NOTE:This Organisation is referred to in item 1, Annex III.   Measures in the Precautionary Stage include the clear-ance of films from lardour Street, preparations for requisitioning of transport as ambulances, arrangements for civil defence broadcast announce-ment, clearance of foodstuffs from London docks, constitution of Pgrt Emergency Committees, introduction of Air Raid Warning system and general air raid precautions arrangements.

Paper No. 295-A.The Cabinet considers the introduction of the scheme for the dispersal of Government Departments, and should decide on the move of the insurance parties of the Service Departments to prearranged locations outside London,HOTB.   This scheme is based on the assumption tiiat the Government should be able to give sufficient warning to enable it to he carried out.   It has been specifically laid down by the Committee of Imperial Defence that a definite and vital responsibility will rest with the Government to take this decision in time.THE SUB-COMMITTEE SECOMLEND that, even if the Cabinet decides that dispersion should not take place in the precautionary period, the Post Office and Office of Works should be authorised by the Cabinet to requisition the necessary premises and install communications. If this is not done the practicability of the move, if proved necessary at a later stage, would be dangerously imperilled.The Cabinet considers the introduction of the special scheme for broadcasting in time of war.NOTE.   Detailed instructions in regard to this scheme have been issued to the B.B.C. (see Annex to Chap. X of War Book).
