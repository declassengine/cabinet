BIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)E OH IT. ,P. 283 (38).CAB I N E to aircraft AND BOMBARDMENT RISKS.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.I circulate herewith, for the consideration of my colleagues, a copy of the Report of a Sub-Committee on Aircraft and Bombardment Risks (C.I.D0 Paper No.l467-B, Enclosure No,l),    and the relevant extract from the 333rd Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence at which this Report was considered (Enclosure No. 2).2.     The main conclusion of the Committee was that in a major war nothing more could be attempted than a scheme of partial compensation at the end of hostilities.      To carry out this scheme, central and regional organisations should be set up by the Board of Inland Revenue, and a Joint Committee of the Departments concerned should be established forthwith to assist the Board of Inland Revenue in working out the detailed plans for the administration of the compensation scheme,,3.     The destruction of property on an immense scale would, however, also give rise to a number of urgent problems which would have to be dealt with immediately, such as emergency reconstruction of working-class houses and of essential property;    special assistance to Local Authorities and Public Utility Undertakings in respectCOPY NO.
of damage;    and the possibility of special provision to meet the case of Building Societies.      It is proposed that a strong Committee should be set up, tinder the Chairmanship of a Minister, to investigate these matters.40     The Committee of Imperial Defence recommended that the proposals in the Report should be endorsed by the Cabinet and that the Cabinet should approve the detailed recommendations set out in Conclusion (a) (See Enclosure NocS).(Intld)    T.W.H.I.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I., 14th October, 1938.

ENCLOSURE.CABINET.AIRCRAFT AND BOMBARDMENT RISKS COMMITTEE.REPORT.THIS Committee was set up in accordance with a Cabinet decision of the 21st April, 1937, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the President of the Board of Trade, with the following terms of reference : &quot;To consider the implications of a scheme for compensation of property owners whose property in Great Britain and Northern Ireland is damaged or destroyed .by hostile action or as the result of defensive measures taken against such, action : to consider what preparatory work can usefully be undertaken in time of peace in anticipation of a scheme being put into operation in time of war for making such compensation as is possible : and to be generally responsible for seeing that any such work is undertaken and completed as soon as practicable.&quot;2.   The following were appointed to serve on the Committee : Sir Frederick Phillips, Treasury (Chairman).Mr. A. L. Dixon, Home Office.Mr. H. H. George, Ministry of Health.Mr. E. H. Hodgson, Board of Trade.Mr. E. N. de Normann, Office of Works.Mr. P. J. G. Rose, Scottish Office,Joint Secretaries: Wing-Commander W. Elliot, Committee of Imperial Defence. Mr. E. A. Shillito, Treasury.As the work of the Committee proceeded, it was found desirable to add to the membership of the Committee, and the following additional members were appointed -Mr. D. L. Paton, Inland Revenue. Mr. E. H. Ritson, Inland Revenue.&quot;Wing-Commander P. Warburton, Air Raid Precautions Department.3. The Committee, having been authorised by Cabinet instructions to consult in confidence representatives of outside interests as might be necessary, have consulted Mr. R. Y. Sketch of the Phoenix Assurance Company Limited, Messrs. K. K. Peters and G. H. Whiteman of the London Salvage Corps, and Mr. A. S. Hinshelwooer, Chairman of the Fire Offices&apos; Committee.Two members of the Committee, Mr. de Normann and Mr. Paton, also consulted on behalf of the Committee the Secretaries of the following bodies : Royal Institute of British Architects. . Chartered Surveyors&apos; Institution.Institution of Civil Engineers. - Institution of Mechanical Engineers.Auctioneers&apos; and Estate Agents&apos; Institute.&quot; [17294] &apos; ----- B
Mr. J. H. McC. Craig, Treasury, Mr. W. Madge, Treasury Valuer, Mr. F. A. Barrett, Inland Revenue, Mr. C. J. Pyke, Board of Trade, and Mr. E. M. H. Lloyd, Food (Defence Plans) Department, also attended meetings of the Committee.State of the matters referred to the Committee.4. The position that the Committee has had to consider is one in which insurance against war risks on land in this country, whether through the insurance companies or under a Government scheme of insurance, will not be available in the event of a future war. In October 1936 the Committee of Lloyd&apos;s followed the example of the insurance companies in refusing to accept insurances against such risks. As regards the possibility of a Government scheme for insurance, the President of the Board of Trade reported to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 12th April, 1937, that he had reached the conclusion that no scheme of insurance would be appropriate to the circumstances of a future war, so far as they could be foreseen, and that the only practicable course was to assume that the Government of the day would make available to property-owners such compensa-tion as might be practicable in the light of all the circumstances of the time. This conclusion was accepted by the Cabinet, and an announcement was made in Parliament as follows : &quot; After a careful review of all the circumstances the Government have reached the conclusion that no scheme of insurance of property in this country against war risks on land would be appropriate to the conditions of a future war so far as they can be foreseen to-day.In the opinion of the Government the most effective form of protection against air-raid risks lies in the effective prosecution of their present pro-gramme of rearmament. If, however, the conditions arise which any scheme of insurance would be designed to meet, it will be for the Government of the day to consider making to owners, whose property had suffered damage, such compensation as may be possible at that time.&apos;&apos;The reasons for which the idea of an insurance scheme to cover the risk of war damage to property on land was rejected as impracticable may be briefly summarised as follows : (a) It is impossible to forecast the scale of the damage that may be anticipated in a future war. The material damage caused in this country by air raids during the Great War was  14,250 per ton of bombs dropped over the whole period, and over the period of twelve months ended 20th May, 1918,  35,000 per ton of bombs. According to the latest Air Staff estimate, which has been endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff and accepted by the Committee of Imperial Defence, the scale of possible attack from the air in this country in a future war might be at the rate of 600 tons per diem on various targets throughout the country for the first few weeks, with a possible maximum drop of 3,500 tons on the first day. Thus, on the basis of the average amount of damage caused by bombs over the . period of twelve months ended the 20th May, 1918 ( 35,000 per ton), the possible damage may amount to about  250 millions in the first week, and about  300 millions in the following fortnight. In the light of these figures it would be necessary to envisage the possibility of damage amounting to some  550 millions in the first three weeks of war, even if thereafter the scale of damage diminished. The total value of property insured against fire at present throughout the country is about  10,000 millions.(5) No estimates are available of the scale of attack after the initial period. Assuming, however, that for the remainder of the first year the average drop fell off by as much as six-sevenths, viz., from 600 tons a day to 600 tons a week, the damage in the first year on the basis of  35,000 per ton of bombs dropped would amount to over  1,500 millions. The amount of the damage would depend to some extent upon the proportion in which the total weight of bombs might be distributed between explosive, gas and incendiary bombs, but the figures which we have given will serve at any rate to indicate the scale of the problem.   The premiums which should be charged under a
self-supporting scheme put into operation on the outbreak of war; are very uncertain, but on the basis of the above figures they could hardly be less than an average of 15 per cent, over the whole country and much higher in particular areas. It is extremely probable that the bulk of property owners would prefer to face the risk rather than pay what wouW seem extortionate premiums. If insurance were made ; compulsory, it would remain impossible in practice to collect severalmillion pounds a day in premiums from property owners, and the attempt (besides depleting the yield of many revenues which are vital to the State), would produce in a most aggravated form the very disturbance in the flow of business which it would be one of the chief objects of an insurance scheme to avoid. (c) If the scheme were to be initiated during peacetime, it might indeed be possible in theory for the rate of premium to be fixed at a lower level, but a premium even one-tenth as high as that necessary in war would still seem extortionate in time of peace. It might besides be a ruinous bargain for the State, for an insurance scheme would impose upon the Government a definite contractual obligation to pay the full amount of the damage to insured property, irrespective of the amounts received by way of premium or of the condition of the national finances generally.5. The Committee has considered various suggestions and proposals which have been put forward in the Press and elsewhere in favour of a complete or partial scheme of insurance. None of these, however, appears to be practical, and in general they are based on a misapprehension of the scale of the problem. For example, the proposals made in more than one quarter that an insurance fund could be built up by calling for a proportionate increase in the payments of property owners under Schedule A of the Income Tax obviously fail since (a) the total yield of Schedule A with Income Tax round 5s. in the  , is of the order of  50 millions a year; (b) there are many exemptions in respect of persons with incomes below the taxable level, charitable institutions, &amp;c, and a complicated system of deductions for repairs which would make the existing machinery for collecting Schedule A very unsuitable for our purpose; (c) while perhaps roughly approximate to building values in outlying districts, Schedule A assessments in large towns reflect in large part the value of the sites, whereas the damage to be insured against is to the buildings. .6. It is to be hoped that in the event of a war the present estimates of the scale of damage may prove to have been exaggerated. The Committee, how-ever, is bound by the estimates which have been approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence. On that basis the conclusion is almost self-evident that in the case of a major war nothing more can be attempted than a scheme of partial compensation at the end of hostilities. It follows that it will be necessary to defer the decision regarding the extent to which losses can be made good by way of compensation until the conclusion of hostilities, when the total amount.of loss sustained can be determined, and the capacity of the nation to bear the financial burden can be estimated. Moreover, if compensation were to be paid during hostilities, the amounts distributed might be used for the reconstruction of unessential property, which would tend to absorb labour and materials urgently needed for other purposes. There would also be the possibility of further damage to the reconstructed property in subsequent air raids.Reconstruction during hostilities.7. The decision to defer the payment of compensation till after the war will, however, entail consequences which need consideration in advance. In so far as damage results in loss of livelihood, the Chrystal Committee, which is considering the organisation and administrative machinery required for the prevention and relief of distress in the event of war, has, it is understood, adopted the principle that the scheme for the prevention and relief of distress should apply to all persons who are in distress as a direct result of the war and would otherwise be a charge upon the Poor Law Authorities. These persons would include those who lose their normal business or employment by reason of the emergency and are not entitled to Unemployment Benefit or Unemployment Assistance. The [17294] b 2
reconstruction or replacement of certain classes of property will no doubt be an urgent necessity both for the successful prosecution of the war and the main-tenance of vital trades, and in the public interest generally, for example, in relation to the housing of the working classes.The Committee is of the opinion that the wartime reconstruction of this type should not be treated as part of a scheme for the payment of compensation, and recommends the adoption of the measures set out in the following paragraphs to deal with this problem.Buildings.8. (a) In many cases, e.g., reconstruction of factory buildings supplying war materials, the problem of necessary rebuilding during hostilities will obviously fall within the sphere of a particular Government Department or Departments. Similarly the reconstruction or temporary repair of essential docks, bakeries, milk depots, railways, &amp;c, will all, as the Committee see the problem, be settled by Government Departments controlling those activities. Subject to proper liaison between these Departments and the central compensation authority there is little more than can be done in advance. The terms on which the properties will be reconstructed must be settled independently of the compensation ultimately to be paid for the destruction of the original property, which cannot be known till much later.(b) A general duty is laid upon local authorities by statute to keep in -constant review the supply of Avorking class accommodation in their district from the point of view of both quality and quantity, and the authorities possess wide powers with regard to rehousing and repairs. It seems best, therefore, that emer-gency repairs to and the reconstruction where unavoidably necessary of working-class houses during the war should be left to the local authorities working under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland, the financing of such activities to be effected, e.g., by borrowing from the Local Loans Fund. (The question of making temporary arrangements for sheltering persons rendered homeless by air raids is, it is understood, under consideration by the Air Raid Precautions Department.)(c) There remain all those cases which will not be covered by the activities either of Government Departments or of local authorities. Reconstruction during hostilities may nevertheless be essential or highly desirable; for example, factories which are very important from the point of view of employment or of export trade may need to be replaced.The Committee is not aware what arrangements are contemplated for restricting unnecessary building activities during any period of hostilities, and, in particular, whether building would be restricted to cases in which the formal assent of some central authority had been obtained or whether control would be exercised by means of restrictions on the supply of labour or the use of particular materials. The problem before the Committee is more limited in scope, viz., whether provision is necessary whereby actual assistance could be given in urgent and exceptional cases towards the repair or replacement of buildings destroyed by air attack. The Committee consider that this task, if undertaken, should be entrusted to a central body on the lines of the Special Areas Reconstruction Association, which might be authorised to advance capital for the purpose of reconstruction on the security of the new or reconstructed buildings which would remain private property.The Committee consider that the Central Body should be financed by lump-sum grants from the Exchequer; the initial grant might be, say,  20 millions.Property other than Buildings.9. While there are obvious- difficulties in giving more favourable treatment * to goods than to buildings, the overriding interests of the State may well require that whatever can or cannot be done in connection with buildings, such arrange-ments should be made as will ensure the supply of essential goods as well as tht maintenance of the export trade and of the import trade so far as permitted by regulation.As regards raw or semi-finished materials, the Board of Trade informed the Committee that 60 or 70 classes of essential materials will be either taken over by the Government at the outbreak of war or &quot; immobilized &quot; (%.*?., not allowed to be moved or sold except under permit).   In many cases &quot; immobilisation &quot;- will
be followed by nationalization, and new purchases from abroad will be effected to the order of the Government. The Committee think that it is not worth while to draw a distinction for their purposes between goods which are immobilised and those which are actually taken over, and, similarly, that it is not worth while to exclude from the area of control stocks which might be destroyed in the short interval between the outbreak of war and the control order. The Committee considers, moreover, that this fact should be made known in advance (either by an announcement or by confidential communication to the trading associations concerned), in order that the stocks of such materials should not be allowed to run down through fear of uncovered air raid damage risks. The drafting of such a communication by the Board of Trade and the Departments responsible for control schemes would, however, require very careful consideration in the light of the circumstances of particular commodities. Clearly Government responsi-bility cannot go beyond the period when the goods are in the wholesale stage.The Committee suggests that it may be desirable to consider also whether cover should be provided for export goods as from the shipper &apos;s warehouse to the ocean-going ship, and for approved import goods from the ocean-going ship to the consignees warehouse. It would be for consideration whether this could be arranged by some extension of the Government Marine Insurance Scheme, and whether the arrangement should be general or confined to particular classes of such goods.With these exceptions the Committee sees no ground for distinguishing between goods and buildings unless again for overriding interests of policy  special arrangements are thought appropriate in the case of ships in course of construction.Position of Property Owners.1Q. The postponement of compensation till after the,end of war and the probability that only partial compensation will then be paid will entail other consequences of great importance. There are bound to be a great number of cases where property-owners are unable, on account of the damage to their property, to meet financial obligations secured in the first instance on that property. This problem will arise not only in connection with mortgages on buildings, but also in regard to movable property. The Committee understands that the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department and the Treasury have under consideration a Bill to be introduced in the event of war, which would give Courts of Law power to postpone the enforcement of any debt if the debtor can establish that he is unable to pay by reason of circumstances attributable to the war. Legislation on these lines should protect persons with the type of Obligation we have in mind at least for the duration of the emergency, but the Committee is of the opinion that steps will have to be taken, before the withdrawal of such protection from them, to modify the financial obligations, if necessary by legislation. Such modification might take the form of apportioning compensation between creditor and debtor in full settlement of their contractual rights and liabilities.Some special attention may be needed in the special case of building societies, since they have over  600 million advanced on mortgage on \\ million different properties, while they have over 2 million shareholders, and, in addition, have attracted deposits withdrawable on short notice of upwards of  130 million from some 750,000 depositors. Their difficulties will arise from (a) the actual destruction of or damage to property in which they are interested, and inability for that reason of debtors to maintain payments on the mortgages; (b) inability of debtors to maintain payments on mortgages as a result of other causes, e.g.,.w&amp;l service; (c) a rush by depositors to withdraw their money in the belief that the position of the societies will be imperilled by war conditions.Some special arrangements or regulations may be required, but it does not seem to the Committee that it is in a position to deal with this particular question. It may be observed that the proposal in paragraph 13 below, under which ultimate compensation would be kept as high as practicable on individual small properties, should assist the position of the building societies by reducing the risk of ultimate insolvency on the part of their debtors.Position of Tenants.11. A somewhat similar problem will arise in the case of tenants in England and Wales who are liable under the covenants in their leases to rebuild the property concerned if it is destroyed or damaged by enemy action.  A letter
from the London Chamber of Commerce to the President of the Board of Trade raising this question and proposing that legislation should be introduced on the outbreak of war to relieve tenants from their obligation to make good damage due to enemy action was brought to the notice of the Committee. The Committee considered that this proposal raised legal issues outside its t competence, and recommended to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade that the Lord Chancellor should be asked to set up an expert Committee^ to consider the question. That Committee, which was set up under the chairman-ship of Mr. A. A. Uthwatt, is now actively engaged on the problem. The present, Committee is concerned only to point out that, in the event of it being decided to introduce legislation to relieve tenants of their liability to repair damaged property, it will be necessary to ensure that the person upon whom the liability to repair rests should be the recipient of the compensation.General Lines of Scheme. Government Scheme of Compensation.12. The Committee has considered in broad principle the basis upon which the amount of the damage in respect of which compensation is to be paid should be calculated. They have come to the conclusion that the most suitable basis for the determination of the amount of loss for this purpose in the case of immovable: property is the diminution in market value.Market value must be related to some particular point of time, and for this, purpose the Committee thinks a date six months before the outbreak of hostilities might be chosen. That is to say, the amount of loss is, in general, to be: determined as the difference between the market value of the property six months before the outbreak of hostilities and the market value which the property would have had at the same date if it had then been subjected to the damage actually suffered. In a certain number of cases this method of calculating loss, might result in a figure higher than the cost of reinstatement; in such cases the; measurement of the loss incurred would be subjected to an overriding maximum,, viz.. the estimated cost of reasonable reinstatement (on the basis of the level of costs existing six. months before the outbreak of hostilities) after allowing as-a set-off any consequential betterment.As regards movable property, the basis of assessment should be the cost of purchase of a similar article less any value remaining after the damage. In the case of property, e.g., furniture, likely to have been in the possession of the-owner before the outbreak of hostilities, the cost of purchase of a similar article should be calculated in terms of costs ruling six months before the outbreak of&apos; hostilities; in the case of consumable goods, the cost of purchase would no doubt have to be related to values at the time of damage.The Committee has no doubt that innumerable questions would arise on-particular cases in practice, but it does not consider that it is possible to deal with any but broad principles at present.13.   In view of the fact that it will be impossible to pay compensation in full, the Committee considers that it will be necessary to adopt a scale for the distribution of the funds it is decided to make available.    The  Sumner -Commission appointed in 1921 to consider claims for compensation for suffering and damage by enemy action, adopted for this purpose the following scale :  -    First  250 of assessment: in full.On any excess of  250 up to  1,000 :   50 per cent, dividend. ,,    ,,      ,,     ,,  1,000 up to  50,000 :  30 per cent, dividend. ,, ,,     ,,  50,000 up to  100,000:  25 per cent, dividend.,,    ,,      ,,     ,,  100,000, 10 per cent dividend.In^any instance where the compensation thus payable exceeded  50,000, payment, was limited to that figure.The Committee considers that some such scale as this will have to be adopted, but that the exact proportions in which it will be advisable to distribute the funds will have to be determined in the light of the circumstances prevailing. It is inclined, however, to the opinion that the scale adopted by the Sumner Commission was not generous enough at the upper end of the scale. In order to make such a scale fully effective, it will probably be necessary to require all applications for compensation by any one person or body to be considered together..
14. The Committee has also considered the question of the scope of the property to be covered by a compensation scheme. It is of the opinion that it will be necessary to define somewhat closely the types of property ^ in respect of which applications for compensation will be entertained, both in view of the necessity of avoiding any ambiguity on the question whether particular losses are proper objects for &quot;&quot;Government compensation or should be dealt with under ordinary fire insurance policies, and in order to exclude applications in respect of articles of luxury in regard to which it will be extremely difficult to obtain evidence of value. After consultation with the Treasury Solicitor and the Chairman of the Fire Offices&apos; Committee, the following formula has been evolved, and the Committee recommends that it should be adopted in connection with a scheme of compensation : Claims for compensation will be considered for loss or damage to property directly caused by any hostile aircraft; by any aircraft engaging the same; by any missile, gas or liquiddischarged from such aircraft (whether hostile or not), from guns engaging such hostile aircraft, from hostile guns not landed in the British Isles, or. from guns fired by the armed forces of the Crown whether on shore, on ship or in the air at an enemy objective not landed in the British Isles; by the concussion of the discharge of any such guns; by the explosion (wheresoever occurring) of mines, torpedoes or depth charges laid, launched or dropped at sea; or by measures taken under proper authority to combat fires directly due to any of the causes hereinbefore mentioned.For the purposes of this scheme &apos;&apos; property &apos;&apos; means property real or personal within Great Britain or Northern Ireland except-(i) money; valuable securities, jewellery or works of art which are not at the date of the loss or damage insured against loss or damage by fire, burglary or theft under a policy of insurance then in force; and (ii) property being ships or aircraft or cargoes carried therein, which at the date of the loss or damage is or, but for the failure of the owner thereof to take the necessary steps in that behalf, could have been insured against the risk of the event which caused the loss or damage under a policy of insurance or a war risks scheme then in force.Note. In order to avoid numerous, claims for trifling damage, e.g., broken windows, no compensation will be payable for the first  5 of damage in respect of which application for compensation is made.Administrative Machinery for a Scheme of Compensation.15. The tasks of assessing the amount of damage in respect of which compensation is payable and of supervising the distribution of funds made available for the pajanent of compensation will require a large organisation. In addition to local staffs throughout the country, some 400 or 500 persons may very probably be required for central administration and the co-ordination of a scheme of compensation. The work will be much greater than in the last war when a central staff of 100 persons was employed. Such an organisation ought, it would seem, to be attached to some important Government Department. In a matter of great political importance and one involving the allocation of enormous sums from public funds, it is essential that the organisation should be throughout under the control of a Minister who can obtain the necessary decisions on major issues of policy from the Government. The Department chosen would be responsible for the preparation made in advance of the emergency and for setting up the machine immediately its services are required.After careful consideration of the various possibilities, the Committee reached the. conclusion that the practical choice of a Department to be entrusted with these duties lay between the Board of Trade and the Board of Inland Revenue. ( The Committee accordingly sought the instructions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade on this point, and the choice fell on the Board of Inland Revenue. While, as the Committee understand, this decision was reached largely having regard to the multiplicity, of special duties in connection with the emergency which had already been assigned to the Roard of Trade, the choice of the Board of Inland Revenue does, as it happens, fit in extremely well with the plans which the Committee had envisaged. It is contemplated (see paragraph 20 below) that that Department will be responsible &quot;for the provision of specialised staff, most of whose work will be of a highly technical character.   The most economical disposition of that staff and the
co-ordination of the work of assessment in different localities will be work which no other Department will be in so good a position to carry out.   The Board shouldalso provide a channel of communication between the proposed organisation andthe Cabinet through the Chancellor of the Exchequer. &quot; .&apos; *       ...16.   While the payment of compensation should be postponed until afterthe end of the War, it is of the essence of the matter that the work of assessing the amount of the losses, in respect of which compensation will eventually be payable, should be undertaken as soon as possible after the occurrence of the:damage.Unless steps are taken immediately after an air raid, i.e., as soon as safety conditions permit, to ascertain the nature and extent of the damage caused subsequent examination of claims will be hampered by a lack of records, and there-will be considerable danger of aggravation of the damage, for example by looting, and of the deliberate removal of undamaged movable property (furniture, stocks. of goods, &amp;c.) by owners with a view to obtaining increased compensation.It is proposed that in the ordinary case an application, or notice of an. intended application, for compensation should be required to be lodged within, a period of 30 days from the occurrence of the damage, and that on receipt of&quot; such an application the work of assessment should begin as soon as possible.17. Some delay therefore is bound to occur before the work of expert assess-ment can be put in hand. Certain preliminary information regarding the. premises which are damaged, and, in a general way, the extent of the damage-could, however, be made available. It is understood that under the passive-defence emergency organisation being set up by the Air Raid Precautions Depart-ment provision will be made for collecting and collating particulars of the. location and nature of air raid damage, either by the police or, in the larger and. more important districts, through the medium of special report centres which would be established for the purpose. The information so collected which is required by the Air Raid Precautions Department for statistical and other purposes should be of some value as a rough preliminary check.The Committee considers that it should also be possible to arrange for the: collection by local authorities of somewhat more extensive information regarding the nature of the damage to property, and recommends therefore that every local authority should be required to render a return of all damage caused by air raids to property within its area, indicating in such detail as is possible the nature of the damage to buildings and other immovable property, together with a general indication of the damage to the contents of buildings. (A draft form for use in this connection is appended as Annex I to this Report.) The returns to be made-by the local authorities should be forwarded to the regional organisations, responsible for the assessment of damage to property (see below).18.   The assessment of the damage caused to property will be a task of a highly technical character and one which will require the existence of an expert-organisation of considerable size.The Committee is of the opinion that it will be desirable to set ,up (a) a central&apos; board to supervise the work of assessment and make recommendations regarding the distribution of such funds as are ultimately made available; (&amp;) regional, organisations to collect the necessary data regarding damage to property and to * put forward assessments of the amounts of loss in respect of which compensation. is due. The Committee&apos;s recommendations regarding the form that these, organisations might take are set out in the succeeding paragraphs.19.   Central Organisation. The Committee recommends that a central com-pensation board should be set up, presided over by a Judge and containing among its members expert representatives of insurance, banking and commerciak interests.   The question of Government representation on the Board will need, consideration.   The Departments mainly interested are the Treasury, the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Health, the Home Office and the Scottish Office.   The Committee feels, however, that the liaison between the Government and the-Central Organisation should be maintained mainly through the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Board of Inland Revenue, and that otherwise any direct repre-sentation of particular Government Departments should be very strictly limited.The Central Board, through the Board of Inland Revenue, should lay down the general principles of, and exercise general supervision over, the assessment of&apos; damage to property and, on the advice of that Department and subject to the-directions obtained by it from the Chancellor, make recommendations to the-
Government regarding the allocation of the moneys which may eventually be provided.20. Regional Organisations. Under the central board should be established regional organisations which can collect evidence regarding the nature of damage at an early stage afterjts occurrence, and put forward as soon as practicable,. for approval or, if necessary, revision by the Central Board, estimates of the amount of loss sustained by applicants for compensation. These regional organisations should consist of such persons as professional surveyors, estate agents, civil and mechanical engineers, architects and insurance company officials specially recruited for the purpose, working under the control of or, where that is not found practicable, as expert advisers to a Civil Servant. After surveying the field the Committee is convinced that the Inland Eevenue Valuation staff is much the best source from which suitable heads of the local staffs can be chosen. The Board of Inland Revenue have estimated that they might be able to provide about 120 Valuers and a similar number of Clerical Officers, who would form at least an invaluable nucleus for the proposed regional organisations. The various professional associations indicated in paragraph 3 of this Report have been approached, and have intimated that they do not anticipate any difficulty in regard to the co-operation of their members in such a scheme of organisation. The Fire Offices&apos; Committee have also indicated the willingness of the Fire Insurance Companies to earmark certain of their staffs in advance for the purpose.21. It is anticipated that much of the damage will occur to property such as machinery and stocks of goods in process of manufacture, with which, until other staff can be trained, fire assessors of experience alone can deal competently. It seems desirable, therefore, that the local organisations should secure the services of reputable firms of such assessors who are at present employed by the Fire Insurance Companies. In view of the smallness of their numbers, they will no doubt have to be concentrated in a few selected localities. It will be desirable to reach some understanding with suitable firms which would prevent any danger of all the available skilled staff being absorbed in the work of helping private claimants to prepare their applications for compensation. The Fire Offices&apos; Committee has been consulted on this point, and has expressed the view that it will be most unlikely that the assessors normally employed by the Insurance Companies would act for private claimants, and that they would undoubtedly agree not to do so if such a request were made to them on the outbreak of hostilities. The Fire Offices&apos; Committee have also supplied the Committee with a list of the firms of London Assessors employed by the Insurance Companies, whose services might be secured for the assessment of losses. This list is attached as Annex II to this Report.22. A further question that will arise in connection with the work of assessing damage is that of the information available for the purpose of verifying estimates of loss put forward by applicants for compensation. Valuable infor-mation in this respect will be available (a) in the records in the Valuation Offices of the Inland Revenue which, supplemented by the plans of buildings in the possession of local authorities, should cover the vast bulk of house property and a large proportion of the industrial premises in the country, and (&amp;) in the records of the Fire Insurance Companies. As regards the latter, the Committee under-stands that it is the practice for these to be regarded as confidential. It is recommended, therefore, that the form of notification of claims for damage should call for a statement as to the particulars of insurances effected by the applicant and require his consent in writing to the disclosure by the insurers concerned of any particulars in regard thereto required by the Central Board.There will no doubt be certain types of movable property, e.g., stocks of goods, in respect of which independent records will not be available for the purpose of checking the validity of claims. In such cases the assessing officials will have to rely upon such evidence as can be obtained, e.g., from the examination of traders&apos; books and warehouse records. Difficulties arising from this cause will, however, be limited by the fact that considerable classes of movable property will be removed from the scope of a compensation scheme through the operation of the Government schemes of control mentioned in paragraph 9 of this Report.23.   The Committee understands that it is at present contemplated that the Railways (in common with various other classes of property) will be requisitioned [17294] If %
by the Government on the outbreak of hostilities. The question will also arise of damage to the property of local authorities and public utility undertakings. The Committee contemplate that the services of the organisation proposed in their Report should be available if desired for the assessment of damage in these cases. Such property would, however, fall outside the scope of the compensation scheme at present under consideration and the general principles of any assistance to be given to local authorities and public utility undertakings would need to be settled separately by the Government. The Committee did not consider this matter as within its competence, but, generally speaking, it assumes that assistance in these cases would not take the form of compensation but of help towards ad hoc reconstruction schemes.24. The Committee has done its best in accordance with its instructions to draw up a suitable plan of organisation and if its recommendations are approved the task will be pursued in greater detail by the Board of Inland Revenue.The Committee cannot, however, leave the subject without again calling attention to the formidable character of the problem. It might at first sight seem easy to adapt our national fire insurance system to meet a new emergency. Such an idea is, however, completely mistaken. Our fire insurance system is second to none, but the whole of the existing organisation of fire insurance companies and fire assessors is fully occupied so far as the assessment of damage is concerned in handling fire claims to a total of, say,  10,000,000 a year. That figure might easily be greatly exceeded by a single day&apos;s air raid damage. A sufficiently large staff skilled in assessing damage simply does not exist. To fill the gap it will be necessary to call on Inland Revenue valuers, engineers, architects, surveyors, estate agents, &amp;c. The Committee feels that with a little experience such an organisation should function satisfactorily: in any case no other type of organisation seems practicable.Problems of Reconstruction after the War.25. The wholesale destruction of property of all sorts during a War would give rise to many problems of reconstruction, afterwards. It may very well be the exception that any considerable areas destroyed would be rebuilt on the pre-war plan, and probably many opportunities for redevelopment of areas would be presented. Substantially altered conditions of this kind would require the consideration of the Town and Country Planning Authorities under the superin-tendence of the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland. It is mentioned here, however, because it appears to be a matter for consideration when the time comes whether or not a grant of compensation for the destruction of, or damage to, a building should be associated with conditions relating to rebuilding or not rebuilding. It might be thought reasonable, for example, to provide that the payment of compensation for property destroyed should carry with it the requirement to conform to a town planning scheme covering the land on which the property had been situated and should be taken into account in connection with any claim to compensation under that scheme.26. In conclusion, the Committee would draw attention to the fact that the recommendations contained in this Report have been based on the assumption that the War in which this country may be engaged is likely to be one of major importance. It is, of course, clear that the conclusions reached might require considerable modification in their application to the circumstances of a War of minor importance, or of a conflict with a distant Power or Powers involving a much smaller risk of attack on this country from the air. In such a case some scheme of Government insurance might be practicable. The Committee has not thought it was necessary to work out such plans in detail. There is an abundance of material available as a result of our experience in the last War and of subsequent study from which a scheme could be rapidly developed.Questions requiring further consideration.27. Assuming that the general recommendations in this Report are approved, the preparation of the detailed plans necessary in respect of the following matters directly related to the question of payment of compensation should be put in hand immediately : (a) The setting up of a Central Compensation Board and regional assessing organisations and the administration of a compensation scheme (paragraphs 12-22).
(b) The collection of information regarding damage (i) by the Air Raid Precautions Department organisation,(ii) by the local authorities (paragraph 17).We recommend that a Joint Committee of the Treasury, Inland Revenue, Home Office, Scottish Office and Ministry of Health should be set up to give the Inland Revenue any assistance they desire on these matters.We further recommend that the Board of Trade should give early considera-tion to the possibility of exceptional provision for the maintenance of the trade in commodities outside the Government control schemes (paragraph 9).The question of the modification of financial obligations secured on property which becomes damaged by air raids (paragraph 10) and of relief to tenants from their obligations under leases to repair damaged property (paragraph 11) is already under active consideration by the Uthwatt Committee.28. Apart from the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph, the destruction of property on the immense scale which it has been necessary for us to contemplate and the postponement of compensation till after the end of the war will create urgent problems of public welfare and security which are somewhat outside the scope of our reference. These concern the provision of temporary shelter and maintenance for persons who are rendered homeless Or workless and the carrying on of essential services and industry. Some of them have been referred to in our Report.  These include : (a) Emergency  reconstruction  of and repairs  to  working-class  houses(paragraph 8 (6)).(b) Emergency reconstruction of and repair to essential property by or underthe instructions of the interested Government Departments (para-graph 8 (a)).(c) Emergency reconstruction in other essential cases (paragraph 8 (c)).(d) The possibility of special provision to meet the case of Building Societies(paragraph 10).(e) Special assistance to local authorities and public utility undertakings inrespect of damage to their property (paragraph 23). (/) The relation between Compensation Payments and post-war reconstruc-tion planning schemes (paragraph 25).So far as we are aware no consideration has yet been given to these and other cognate problems for which, if the emergency arises, carefully prepared plans should be available. In view of the number of Departments concerned we suggest that this aspect of the abnormal conditions likely to result from sustained and extensive bombardment from the air should be explored and the necessary plans prepared by a strong Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, containing representatives of the Treasury, Inland Revenue, Board of Trade, Home Office, Scottish Office, Ministry of Health and Office of Works with a full-time Secretary seconded for the work from one of the Departments concerned primarily, with whom should be associated an officer of the C.I.D. It may also be for consideration whether the Sub-Committee should be placed under the Chairmanship of a Minister.(Signed)F. F.PHILLIPS. A. BARRETT (on behalf of Mr. E. H. Ritson).L. DIXON.A. H. E. E.

JL. M, Jt,VT- ^ &quot;TV&quot; &quot;A&apos; *7V&quot; -A&quot; -7V1(3) AIRCRAFT AND BOMBARDMENT RISKS.(OLD. Paper No. 1467-B.)(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 292nd Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of a Sub-Committee on Aircraft and Bombardment Risks (C.I.D. Paper No. 1467-B).SIR JOHN SIMON said that the Report had been drawn up by a strong Sub-Committee which had reached unanimous conclusions. He suggested that, broadly speaking, the Committee of Imperial Defence should accept these conclusions. There were two main points, however, to which he wished to draw special attention. The first was that, owing to the incalculable nature of the risks involved in damage to property by aircraft bombardment, it was impossible to devise a system of insurance which would cover these risks. It was an uninsur-able proposition. The only feasible plan was to attempt a scheme of partial compensation by which the financial resources of the State could be applied at the end of hostilities in accordance with the extent of damage incurred and the; amount of money which was available. The necessity for postponing such compensation until the end of the war was due to the obvious fact that no payment could be made until the full bill was known. To arrive at this knowledge, however, it was necessary to have a machine which would be ready to measure the damage from the moment when it began to occur. The recommendation in the Report, with which he agreed, was that this machine should be set up now by the Board of Inland Revenue. The second point arose out of the announcement which would have to be made on this subject in Parliament. The recent crisis had produced a pressing demand that an announcement should be made without delay, and he had promised this at an early date. Such an announcement, how-ever, raised the very important political issue of the need for a corresponding announcement about the intentions of the Government to pay compensation for human injuries and loss of life. Claims would inevitably be preferred by persons who had been injured and by the relations of those who had been killed. It was therefore essential that any announcement regarding the intention of the Government to provide compensation for damage should be accompanied by a similar announcement regarding compensation for human injury and loss of life.SIR THOMAS INSKIP pointed out that the question of compensation to civilians for loss of life or injury from air attack had already been examined by a Sub-Committee whose Report* had been taken by the Committee of Imperial Deferrce on the 15th July, 1937.t The scheme recommended by this Sub-Committee had been approved both by the Committee of Imperial Defence and by the Cabinet,^ and. the Ministry of Pensions had been entrusted with the task of working out the necessary details, g* C.I.D. Paper No. 257-A.f C.I.P./297th Meeting, Minute 5.t Cabinet 37 (37), Conclusion 12.g Note : The Conclusions of the C.I.D. on this subject are attached as an Appendix to these Minutes.&apos;- - Copy No.[18034-3]
SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the announcement regarding the intention to? pay compensation for damage should be qualified by a statement that such compensation&quot; would entail an obligation on certain property holders to provide air raid precautions.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought that, whereas this might be possible in regard to new houses, it would be difficult to apply in the&apos; case of existing buildings.Mr. WALTER ELLIOT pointed out that difficulties would be encountered even in respect of new buildings, particularly those which were being built under the Government Housing Scheme. Here it was very desirable to avoid measures which would raise the cost of these new houses, such as. the provision of cellars or structural alterations for air raid precautions. The result of this policy might be to reverse the present tendency for houses to be built each with a small garden in which trenches could be dug for protection against air attack.Mr. STANLEY saw the force of Mr. Elliofs arguments with regard to dwelling-houses, but considered that it would be perfectly reasonable to demand that owners of big blocks of commercial and industrial buildings should provide air raid precautions as a quid pro quo for such compensation as they might expect to receive for their damage in the event of war.SIR JOHN SIMON agreed, pointing out that this could be regarded as being on a par with the precautions which householders were already required to take against the risks of fire by the provision of fire-escape staircases.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD suggested that the question of making the compensation which would be paid for damage in war conditional on the provision of air raid precautions in buildings was a matter which might conveniently be considered by the proposed Ministerial Sub-Committee mentioned in the final paragraph of the Report.Mr. STANLEY said that, while he agreed in general with the recommenda-tions of the Report, he felt it necessary to emphasise that the announcement of a decision to postpone compensation until the end of hostilities would probably result in an immediate and unfortunate diminution in certain industrial stocks. Whilst it would no doubt be possible to counteract this contingency in respect of commodities over which the Government would assume control in war, e.g., food, by taking the commercial interests concerned into the confidence of the Govern--ment, he was gravely apprehensive that there would be an immediate reaction towards reducing stocks of commodities outside Government Control Schemes.SIR FREDERICK PHILLIPS pointed out that this point had been given careful consideration by the Sub-Committee in paragraph 9, and that their recommendation (in paragraph 27) was that the Board of Trade should give early consideration to the possibility of exceptional provision for the maintenance of trade in commodities outside the Government Control Schemes. Continuing, he said that the Uthwatt Committee, which had been appointed by the Lord Chancellor, had now reported on the questions which had been referred to it, namely, the modifications of financial obligations secured on property which becomes damaged by aircraft (paragraph 10 of the Report), and the relief of tenants from their obligations under leases to repair damaged property (paragraph 11 of the Report), and suggested that the Report of the Uthwatt Committee should be taken into consideration by the proposed Ministerial Committee.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : -(a) To recommend to the Cabinet that the proposals contained in the Report of the Sub-Committee on Aircraft and Bombardment Risks (C.I.D. Paper No. 1467-B) should be endorsed by the Cabinet, and that the Cabinet should, in particular, approve :-*(i) the general principle that in the case of a major war nothing more can be attempted than a scheme of partial compensation at the end of hostilities (paragraph 6 of the Report).
(ii) the general lines of the Government Scheme of Compensationsuggested in the Report (paragraphs 12-14). (iii) the proposed Central and Regional Organisations to be set up by the Board of Inland Revenue for carrying out the Govern-ment Scheme of Compensation (paragraphs 15-22 of  the Report).(iV) the setting up of a Joint Committee of the Treasury; Inland Revenue, Home Office, Scottish Office and Ministry of Health, to assist the Board of Inland Revenue in regard to the execution of the proposed Government Scheme of Compensation, and that the Board of Inland Revenue should forthwith take steps towards this end.(v) the setting up of a strong Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence under the Chairmanship of a Minister, to be appointed by the Prime Minister, with a full-time Secretary, to consider the points set out in paragraph 28 (a) to (/) of the Report, namely : -. &quot; (a). Emergency reconstruction of and repairs to working-class houses (paragraph 8 (b) ). (b) Emergency   reconstruction  of   and   repair  to  essential property by or under the instructions of the interested Government Departments (paragraph 8 (a)). &apos; (c) Emergency reconstruction in other essential cases (para-graph 8 (c) ).id) The possibility of special provision to meet the case ofBuilding Societies (paragraph 10). (e) Special assistance to local authorities and public utility undertakings in respect of damage to their property(paragraph 23).(/) The relation between Compensation Payments and post-war reconstruction planning schemes (paragraph 25).&quot;and in addition a further point, namely : (g) The possibility of imposing an obligation on property owners to carry out Air Raid Precautions measures as a condition to their enjoying the benefits of the Govern-ment Compensation Scheme.  .(vi) the recommendation in paragraph 9 of the Report that the Boardof Trade should give early consideration to the possibility of exceptional provision for the maintenance of the trade commodities outside the Government Control Schemes.(&amp;) To invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs to take early steps to link up the above recommenda-tions in regard to a scheme for compensation to property owners whose property is damaged or destroyed by hostile action, with the recommendations put forward by the Committee of Imperial-Defence (C.I..D. Paper No. 257-A and C.I.D. Minutes of the 297th Meeting, Minute 5), and approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 37 (37), Conclu-sion 12) in regard to the question of the compensation to civilians for loss of life or injury from air attack, with a view to the preparation of a public announcement covering both these matters.(c) That the Report of the Uthwatt Committee on the question of the modification of financial obligations secured on property which becomes damaged by air raids, and of relief to tenants from their obligations under leases to repair damaged property, should be taken into account Joy the proposed Ministerial Committee;* * * * * *Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1, October 6, 1938.
APPENDIX.Conclusions^ of the Committee of Imperial Defence on their Consideration of the Report^ of the Sub-Committee on Compensation to Civilians for Loss of Life or Injury from Air Attack.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : To make the following recommendations to the Cabinet-(i) That the Report of the Sub-Committee on Compensation to civilians for Loss of Life or Injury from Air Attack (C.I.D. Paper No. 257-A) should be endorsed by the Cabinet as a suitable machinery, on the understanding that any decision as to whether or not a scheme of compensation should be put in force at the time of any future emergency is a matter for Government decision at the time, subject to-(a) the settlement between the Treasury, War Office and the Ministry of Pensions of the question raised by the Secretary of State for War regarding the relation of the - scale of compensation proposed to that which would applyto a private soldier; and(&amp;) the more precise definition by the Ministry of Pensions of the expression &quot; gainfully employed.&quot;(ii) That the Minister of Pensions, in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned, should work out the necessary details in accordance with the recommendations of the Report.(iii) That the necessary notations should be made in the War Book inorder to ensure that the Minister of Pensions should bring the matter before the Cabinet on the outbreak Of war.(iv) That no general announcement should be made regarding anynational compensation scheme, but that the Home Secretary should be empowered, in the course of his forthcoming discussions with the Local Authorities, to state that the principle of compensation to Air Raid Precautions Personnel was accepted by the Govern-ment, without specifying any particular rate or mentioning the fact that a National Scheme of Compensation was contemplated.[Note by the Secretary. The above recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence were approved by the Cabinet at a meeting held on October 13, 1937.
