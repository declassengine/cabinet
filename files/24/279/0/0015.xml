October 1938.Copy No.CABINET.ITALY.ECONOMIC SITUATION IN ITALY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a memorandum which has been prepared in the Foreign Office regarding the present economic situation in Italy which may be of some interest.H.October 3, 1938.ECONOMIC SITUATION IN ITALY.THE economic situation under the three militant Dictatorships Germany,. Japan, Italy is a question of tantalising importance. It is important because upon the economic strength or weakness of these countries depends their ability in the long run to force upon their reluctant neighbours the policies of expansion upon which, in different measure, they have embarked. It is tantalising because (a) one cannot rely implicitly upon the statistical data published by the three Governments or available in the press (many of the essential figures are suppressed altogether and many, one suspects, are unreliable), and (6) systems of closed economy in modern conditions have not continued long enough to provide any basis of comparison; in fact, the essential question how long these artificial economic constructions, depending as they do on a slow deterioration of the standard of living in those countries, can endure, has not yet been answered.It must be admitted that the laws of economics must tell in the end. The countries which have deliberately ignored them in order to push on with military policies must eventually pay for what they have wasted. The allocation of national capital to unproductive enterprises must result in national impoverish-ment and eventual weakness. Japan and Italy have, it is thought, wasted more proportionately of their economic strength than Germany. Italy is probably nearer to overstrain than Japan. But the examples of the U.S.S.R. and Germany have shown that centralised control within a closed economy can do marvels; in organising resources and controlling discontent; so it is much too early to count on an economic smash in Italy. On the other hand, the greater the economic stress the more necessary will Signor Mussolini find it to divert popular attention abroad and to produce foreign scapegoats to bear the blame for the difficulties in which his people may find themselves.The Foreign Office have recently received several despatches from Rome bearing on the situation in Italy, and the following memorandum embodies an attempt to co-ordinate and appraise this information. It should be emphasised that this memorandum represents only the views of the Foreign Office; it has not been submitted to any other department:  10074   [17995]SECRET.CP. 215 (38).
1. Ever since the period of sanctions Italy&apos;s economic situation has been the subject of close study abroad, and Signor Mussolini&apos;s speech at Aprilia on the 4th July last has brought it once more into the limelight of political controversy. It may therefore be convenient to summarise as briefly as possible our present information on Italy&apos;s economic position in general.       .2. 1936 was the year of sanctions, and Italian trade figures were therefore abnormal; the only feature of it that calls for comment here is that the wheat crop amounted to only 61 million quintals against a local consumption of a little over 80 million, so that a considerable quantity of wheat had to be imported at a total cost of about 1,389 million lire during 1937. The year terminated with an adverse balance of trade of 5,639 million lire.3. The trade figures for the first six months of 1937 were far from cheerful, showing an adverse balance of 3,159 million lire; but this included these excep-tional wheat imports, costing about 1,200 million lire, and olive oil, costing another 400 millions. The adverse balance on what might be called normal trade account was therefore, roughly, 1,500 million lire; this was regarded as satisfactory, since invisible payments were estimated to bring in 3,000 million lire a year, which would cover the deficit on normal trade account. Two facts must, however, be borne in mind in considering these and later trade figures : (1) an amount which cannot be estimated must be added to the deficit to cover the cost of direct imports into the Colonial Empire the corresponding direct, exports are at present negligible and (2) something must also be added to allow for the liquidation of old indebtedness, since many of the clearings made provision for this, as did the Anglo-Italian clearing. . -4. The wheat crop of 1937 was good (80 million quintals), as were most other crops, and Signor Guarneri, the Minister responsible for the allocation of exchange, stated that he proposed to take the twelve months beginning on the 1st July, 1937, as a test period in which to try to balance Italy&apos;s payment account. To do this he required to keep the trade deficit to 3,000 million lire, the maximum that could be covered by invisible exports. The figures given in a recent despatch from Rome (No. 714 E. of the 29th July) show that he has failed in his task, for, in the twelve months ended the 30th June, the total deficit on trade account was 4,528,498,000 lire. Unless, therefore, invisible exports exceed Signor Guarneri&apos;s estimate of 3,000 million lire, the net deficit to be met out of Italy&apos;s meagre resources must have amounted to over 1,500 million lire.5. The foreign trade figures have thus given little cause for satisfaction. Recently, however, there has been some improvement; the deficits for April and May were only just over 270 million lire; there was a slight rise in May to 327 million lire, but this figure may have been swollen by the inclusion of excep-tional items such as parcel post exports and imports for the first six months of the year; in July the deficit was down to 267 million lire. At this level the trade deficit could probably very nearly be covered by invisible exports, but it is to be noted that this result has been achieved by cutting imports to the lowest figure since the sanctions period, which may possibly involve increased imports of raw materials later in the year, if the export trade, largely dependent on imported raw materials, is not to suffer. It must also be borne in mind that, as stated above, these figures do not include trade with the colonies, on which there is certainly a deficit, and that Italy&apos;s invisible exports consist largely of receipt from the tourist traffic, which has not been very satisfactory this year.6. At one time it was feared that the wheat crop would fall far below the 80 million quintals required to meet internal consumption.&apos; As late as the beginning of July the Minister of Agriculture stated that the crop would amount to about 70 million quintals, but by the beginning of September this estimate had been revised, and it was announced that the crop would produce 80 million quintals, which, as indicated above, would be sufficient to meet Italy&apos;s needs. The most serious threat to Italy&apos;s economic position has thus been removed and it seems unlikely that wheat imports on an important scale will be necessary this year. The Minister of Agriculture in the speech referred to above claimed that the rice crop would be as good as last year, but the Embassy are inclined to doubt it,, and the mulberry (for silk-worm breeding), fruit, wine and beet crops will certainly be yer\ bad.
7. One feature of the wheat position calls for comment here. After the good crop of 1937 there should have been no need for wheat imports, at least until the later months of this year, especially seeing that since December 1937 the bread has been adulterated with 10 per cent, of maize. Yet in April and May of this year the Italians were importing wheat on sellers&apos; terms, and raised the percentage of adulteration to 20 per cent. In view of Italy&apos;s desperate exchange position they would hardly have done this unless it had been absolutely essential; the explana-tion is perhaps that considerable quantities of wheat have had to be exported to East Africa, so that even the large crop of 1937 was exhausted. Another explana-tion is that a large quantity of wheat stored in silos was found to have gone bad and to be unfit for human consumption, so that it had to be destroyed, and the stocks hurriedly replenished. It should be added that while the wheat position now appears to be satisfactory, there is still some anxiety regarding the maize crop and Italy&apos;s exports of such things as silk, fruits and wine will this year almost certainly be lower than usual. Cheese exports may also be affected by the slaughtering of cattle on account of the impossibility of getting enough fodder to feed them.8. To meet this exchange situation, Italy has but the slenderest resources. The published gold reserve of the Bank of Italy at the end of 1937 was 4,028 million lire. The gold contributions of the sanctions period have been utilised to balance the budget, but in whole or in part these may still be available as an additional State reserve. The foreign securities taken over under the Bolzano decrees appear already to have been disposed of. It thus seems that unless the balance of payments can be held level in the twelve months beginning the 1st July, 1938, the Bank of Italy&apos;s gold reserve may have to be sacrificed.9., Hitherto, the depressing picture of a persistently adverse balance of payments has been offset by a measure of internal prosperity, mainly based on armaments and the boom following the Abyssinian war; industrial profits have been comparatively high, there have been enough funds available to meet the needs of the Treasury, and there has been very little unemployment. Since the beginning of this year the trend has been slightly the other way (see paragraph 9 of Rome despatch No. 154 E. of the 9th February, 1938), and the latest figures quoted in Rome despatch No. 627 E. of the 28th June show that there was a marked drop in April in all spheres of industrial activity. If this trend con-tinues, internal conditions must become increasingly difficult. Despite rigid price control, the restriction of rents and the stabilisation of charges of public utility services, the standard of living seems to have been falling for some time and there certainly cannot be much margin; already there have been reports of riots in protest against the poor quality of the adulterated bread, and if short time and unemployment are to be added to the diminished return on poor crops, the resources of the Fascist regime and Signor Mussolini&apos;s personal prestige are likely to be strained to the utmost to pull the country through the coming winter. Moreover, the heavy burden of taxation will be more keenly felt, revenue will tend to diminish, and the budget deficit will less easily be covered by borrowing. It is unlikely that the financial situation will give such conspicuous evidence of stringency as the foreign trade figures; but on a long view it is, as the following figures show, no less precarious than the balance of international payments.10. Between July 1935 and June 1937 the accumulated deficit (including, of course, that on the extraordinary budget created to finance the Abyssinian war) amounted to 30,946 million lire. The deficit on the last financial year, despite windfalls from the capital levy and property tax, cannot have amounted to much less than 12,000 million lire, so that in four years the excess of expenditure over revenue has been of the order of  460 million an enormous total compared with an annual revenue amounting only to some three-fifths of that sum. It is true, of course, that by far the greater part of the deficit is accounted for by military expenditure in Abyssinia and Spain, and that Italy can reasonably count on a progressive reduction in the former and, sooner or later, a cessation of the latter. The fact remains, however, that the national indebtedness has increased with dangerous rapidity in the last four years, and that the ordinary budget has only been kept anjnvhere near a balance during that period by a series of expedients, such as the capital levy and property tax, which cannot be indefinitely repeated without serious effects on the industrial machine, public confidence and the standard of living.
11. To sum up, Italy has of late been living beyond her means, and, unless, she can improve her international trade position and cut down unproductive expenditure, she may well find herself, sooner or later, in the international bankruptcy court. It is true that in a totalitarian State controlled by a strong Government economic laws do not appear to operate in the s,ame manner as elsewhere; but, even so, assuming that the present trend in Italy continues without substantial improvement, it is hard to see how a crisis can,be averted indefinitely. The crash will not, of course, come in the immediate future indeed the day of reckoning may be deferred for a considerable time by concentrating on. export trade at the expense of the home market with the help of such expedients-as a new devaluation or export subsidies. These methods, however, are in them-selves forms of concealed taxation which can only depress still further the standard of living, and they offer no permanent solution of Italy&apos;s economic-difficulties.
