THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT k SECRET.COPY NO. LlS0 A B I N E T0CP.217 (38).AMENDMENT OF THE WHEAT ACT. Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries., the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for the Home Department.la It has already been announced in Parliament thatthe Government propose to introduce, as soon as possible, a Bill to amend in certain particulars the Wheat Act, 1932.     We now seek the approval of our colleagues to the preparation of a Bill for this purpose02. The Act provides for quota payments to be made bymillers and importers on all flour delivered in the United Kingdom., The quota payments are paid into the Wheat Fund,from which deficiency payments are made to wheat growers.     The Act is administered by the Wheat Commission, which includes representatives of the interests affected, with an independent Chairman (Lord Harlech, who has succeeded the late Lord Peel) and Vice-chairman.3. The administration of the Act has so far proceededsmoothly,  thanks to the co-operation of the interests concerned, but there are two important respects in which amendment is desirable^4*     &quot;Standard jpric e&quot; of wheat * **   The more urgent of these two matters, politically, is that provision should be made for the periodical review of the &quot;standard price&quot; (at present 10/-per cwt.) which determines the amount of the deficiency payments to wheat growers,, The Act of 1932 made provisionfor only one such review, which took place in 1935, and did not result in any change in the &quot;standard price&quot;.       The proposal
for further- reviews in 1939 and at three-yearly intervals thereafter will meet the urgent representations of farmers that machinery should he provided for the standard price to be reviewed. fJ&quot;om time to time and,  if necessary,&apos; amended, in the event of any substantial change in cost levels.5. Definition of liability to quot a payment, -     The secondmatter of importance relates tc liability to the levy known as &quot;quota payment&quot;.      Quota payments are not levyable on &quot;wheat cffals&quot;, which are defined as  &quot;the residual products which, in the process of milling wheat, are extracted therefrom as germ or for animal or poultry food&quot;.      Litigation arose ever certain imported products claimed by the importer to be wheat offals but held by the Wheat Commission to be flour (and thus liable) and the case finally went tc the House of Lords, whose judgment appeared to imply that documentary evidence that the goods were produced as residual or by-products for animal or poultry food, outweighed technical and. scientific evidence as to their nature,6. The Wheat Commission thereupon-represented to our predecessors that the administration of the Act on the basis of this judgment would be fraught with uncertainty and the possibility of fraud.,  and that eventually millers and importers would be able so to arrange the production and description of their products as to limit the liability for ,quota payments to their deliveries of flour for human consumption, which would be contrary to the agreed basis of the 1932 Act.      The Wheat Commission were accordingly invited to formulate,  in consultation with the interests affected,  proposals for 4amending legislation;    and in the meantime the National Associations representing millers and importers of flour and wheat offals entered into a Gentleman&apos;s Agreement with the Wheat Commission, whereby they undertook .&apos;-,o use Iheiv influence to ensure that no attempt was made to claim that-low grade flour should be exempt from quota payment,
1 9Q 1 ht &amp;7. The Commission have now placed, before us proposals,agreed with the Associations, designed to remove the present uncertainty.    In &quot;brief the Commission propose a new definition of wheat offals, based on proportion of mineral ash content, with a graduated scale of quota payments, also based on the ash content, for the small quantity of products intermediate between commercial wheat offals and commercial flour which have been the main cause of difficulty in the past.    We recommend that these proposals be accepted, 8. Wheat meal. - The Commission have also taken advantageof the opportunity to propose various other amendments of the Act which have appeared to them desirable in the light of their experience in the administration of the Act.    In the first place, the   Commission propose the withdrawal of the exemption from quota payment which the 1952 Act granted in respect of wheat meal used as an animal er poultry feeding-stuff.    In view, however, of the present difficulties of the poultry industry and the resentment which would be caused by-any action which could be represented as assisting wheat growers at the expense of poultry keepers and leading to an increase, however small, in poultry-keepers&apos;  costs, we have not felt able to accept this suggestion, and we propose that the present exemption of wheat meal from quota payment should continue, 9. Wheaten breakfast foods. - The Commission also proposethat wheaten breakfast foods should be made liable for quota payment.    We consider that such breakfast foods should only be made liable for quota payment on the recommendation of an independent committee, who would have to consider the competition of these foods not only with bread and biscuits manufactured from flour liable to the quota,levy, but also with non-wheaten breakfast foods which could not be made liable for quota payment in any case. 10* Other matters. -   The remaining projoosals of the   wheat commission appear to be non-contentions and are mainly for the purpose of removing doubts and anomalies In connection with the
administration of the Act of 1932,     They include provisions to enable the Commission to refund quota payments on flour used in the manufacture of exported goods,   and to contribute towards research and education activities in relation to the wheat&apos; industry.11. In accordance with the wishes of the Treasury we propose to take advantage of the opportunity of the amending Bill to provide that hypothetical charges in respect of pensions and rent shall be Included among the administrative expenses of Government Departments which are.recoverable from the Wheat Fund.I2 *     SLimrnary. -   We seek authority for the preparation of a Bill to amend the Wheat Act,  1952.      The principal provisions of the Bill would be -- (a) A committee to review periodically the (l standard price&quot;   (paragraph 4)(b) A new analytical definition of flour and wheat offals, to remove difficulties caused&apos; by recent litigation (paragraphs 5 to 7).(c) Provision for making wheaten breakfast foods liable for quota payment,  if recommended by an independent committee  (paragraph 9),A number of minor matters will also be dealt &quot;with in the Bill (paragraphs 10 11);    but we do not propose to adopt the suggestion of the Wheat Commission that the present exemption of wheat meal from quota liability should be withdrawn (paragraph 8).J. C &apos; S. H .12th October, 1938.
