(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET..CAB I N E T.AUSTRALIAN CO-OPERATION IN THE DEFENCE OF EGYPT. Hote by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.In the course of a talk with Mr. Bruce this afternoon I asked him how long it would be before Australian troops could arrive in Egypt, assuming that if we were involved in war Egypt would be attacked by Italy and become one of the danger spots.He replied that he thought it would take about two months.     If it was suggested that the Australians should   send a force to fight in Czechoslovakia or anywhere in Central or Eastern Europe there would be little enthusiasm.     But he thought there would be a really enthusiastic response to ah appeal for men to fight against &quot;the dirty Italians&quot; in defence of Egypt, the Suez Canal and Palestine.     He thought that a considerable force could be raised, and that they would be exactly the type of men for an Egyptian war. He added that he thought it would be a good idea to get the members of his Government thinking about this, and I have no doubt that he will telegraph to them on the point.COPY NO.CP.  509(58).(Intd.)   M.M.Colonial Office, S.W.1.24th September,  1958.
