CONFIDENTIAL. A.C.417.vfBOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE,OF TRADE    -    SEPTEMBER,  1938.Summary- of reports submitted by Members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.      Imports in September ( 75.0 million)  showed a decline of  IS.8 million as compared with September, 1937. Imports of raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were  8.5 million less, but imports of food, drink and tobaccc increased by  1*5 million.     Exports of United Kingdom products ( 39.8 million) were  4.5 million less than in September, 1937.EMPLOYMENT.     Employment showed a further decline in September as compared with August.      It is provisionally estimated that at 12th September the number of insured persons aged 16-64 in employment in Gt. Britain exclusive of persons within the agricultural scheme was approximately 11,380,000.  This was 23,000 less than at 15th August 1938 and 326,000 less than at 13th September, 1937.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.      In the four weeks ended 25th September, railway traffic recently decreased by  706,000 (5.35 per cent), as compared with the corresponding period of 1937.     As from the 1st October last, charges were increased by 5 per cent,  (except suburban passenger fares within the London passenger transport area).SKIPPING^      The general outlook remained unpromising. The Chamber of Shipping &quot;index number of freights at 126.3, (1935 a 100), was almost unchanged from that of August and some 37g- per cent, lower than in the peak month of September, 1937.
SHIPBUILDING.    The lack of new orders continued to cause anxiety, although shipyards have much Government work on hand.      There was a further fall in tonnage under construction at 30th September as compared with a year ago, and a substantial fall in tonnage commenced during the quarter (87,000 tons as compared with 219,000 tons in the corresponding quarter of 1937).BANKING.    The political conditions of the month were reflected both in the banking figures and in the state of the money market.      Clearing bank average deposits declined by  29 million as compared with September, and the withdrawal of foreign balances and of notes from the banks, made money very short.      The market eased again, however, after the tension had been relaxed.BUILDING. Apart from work on the Defence Programme and for local authorities housing requirements, there was a considerable diminution in general activitjr in the building industry. Unemployment in the summer months increased, contrary to the usual seasonal trend. Plans approved by 144 local authorities in August were 8.7 per cent higher in value than in August, 1957&apos;.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE IN SCOTLAND.    There has been a decided falling off in the drapery trade   during the past quarter,  as compared with a year ago,  owing to lack of confidence in markets.     All factories and workrooms, however, were well employed and prospects are. rather more hopeful.      Trade in the furnishing section has also been maintained.FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD. EUROPE.    Continental markets in September were under the influence of the international crisis.      Security prices declined generally,  and money rates hardened.
JAPAN.    The money market continued easy and Government bonds were in good demand.      The ratio of gold reserves against notes issued by the Bank of Japan is considerably less than a year ago.UNITED STATES.    Markets continued strong and business activity improved further.      Under the influence of the European political situation, the Dollar was in constant demand and improved to 4.61 on the 28th September..COAL.    The Coal trade was adversely affected by the disturbed political situation in September, and there was no general improvement in the export trade.      Inland demand was somewhat better in some districts.IRON &amp; STEEL. - The general position changed little during September.      But heavy steel makers were well occupied on the whole, and there was an improvement in demand in some other sections.      Pig iron output in September at 430,000 tons was 3% less than in August and 41$ less than in September, 1937.      Crude steel production was 755,000 tons as compared with 1.2 million tons last year.TIMBER.    Markets in September were firmer than in August, owing partly to the agreement of the Exporters&apos; Convention to a further reduction of export quotas., and partly to a slight increase (following successive reductions) in the prices issued by Russian shippers..ENGINEERING.    Owing to the International tension during the past month the recession in activity in the engineering industry was aggravated and the volume of new civil orders declined further..     Exports of machinery were valued at  4.5 million as compared with  4.3 million in September, 1937.CHEMICALS.    There was considerable buying in September owing to the international situation, but apart from this there was an improvement in general trade during the month. Sales of alkalis and heavy chemicals increased, and the demand for dyestuffs was slightly better.      The market for coal tar products however, continued to be depressed.
NON-FERROUS METALS.      Metal markets were dominated in September by the international situation, and there was some buying against Government orders.     Prices were irregular in September and have risen during October.MOTOR INDUSTRY.   &quot; New registrations of mechanically propelled vehicles in   August were 21,638, a decline of 1,879 as compared with a year before.      Exports of private cars in the first 9 months of the year were lower than a year earlier, the first decline since 1931.      The number of vehicles in use, however, in October this year was estimated to be considerably more than in October, 1937.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      The international situation affected the numbers of enquiries and orders during September but there was no very pronounced falling away.      Prices in the home market remained steady.      The value of exports of electrical goods and machinery in September was 3% greater than in September, 1937.      The amount of electricity generated was 6. 8% greater. .COTTON.     There was a small increase in activity during September, due partly to buying of textiles&quot; for possible war requirements.     Exports were appreciably greater than for some months, exports of cotton yarns being 10.7 million lbs. as. compared with 9.0 million lbs.  in August and 11.9 million lbs. in September, 1937.      Exports of piece goods were 117 million sq. yds. in September, as compared with 108 million sq. yds. in August, and 157 million sq.  yds.  in September, 1937.WOOL.      There was an improvement in the general activity of the industry as a whole in September as compared with the previous month.    Activity over the first nine months, however, as compared with the corresponding period of 1937 was considerably less.     Exports of tops and yarns in September showed an improvement in quantity over those of the year before, but exports of tissues declined considerably.&quot;
C4 Ci f%HOSIERY^     Trade in most sections continued to improve Tout it is doubtful whether the setback of the first six months of 1938 can he entirely overcome.RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of daily retail sales in August was 2. Q% higher than in August, 1937*      Sales of food and perishables increased in value hy 4.5$ and of non-food, merchandise hy 0.4$*     Preliminary returns for September indicate that as a result of the internalional crisis purchases of food increased, while purchases of non-food, merchandise were restricted, these effects being felt more  trongly in the London area.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.    Bales of wool received into store for the two months ended 31st August, 1938, were 344,000 as compared with 463,000 a year ago;    the quantities disposed of hy sale or shipment were 20,000 and 28,000 respectively.      Imports of merchandise during August were valued at  12*1 million (Australian currency) as compared with  11.2 million last year.CANADIAN TRADE.     Wholesale prices declined further after the beginning of July, although common stock prices remained fairly steady.      The index for business activity improved slightly.INDIAN TRADE.      Imports of merchandise into India (apart from Burma) for September, 1938, were less than in the previous month and considerably lower than those for September, 1937c Exports were also lower than a year ago.SOUTH APR!CAN TRADE.      Total imports In August declinedfurther by 15%*     Aggregate exports were 50,2% less thanAugust, 1937, shipments of gold being 60.1$ lower.      coal exports rose substantially as compared with a year before, but .exports of diamonds, wool, maize, fruit and sugar were t,considerably less.COLONIAL TRADE.

There has, however, been a slight hardening of prices of the chief products.
