(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY No._U-^SECRET.CP. No, 804/38.CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 21st September,  1938,Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
1. Provincial ministries.      Of the fourministries which were not under Congress control, that of the Punjab- continues to stand firm and that of Bengal survived without further incident the Assembly Session which ended on August 23rd.        In Sand, the agitation against the barrage assessment has continued with vigour, and the ministry has been under fire from both the Congress and the Moslem League parties.      The Congress High Command has intervened but has failed to turn the situation to its advantage:    and the ministry, which has not had occasion to face the Legislature since the beginning of June,  stands fast.      The other ministry, that of Assam, has fallen:    on September 13th, the Premier announced to the Assembly that he .and his colleagues had tendered their resignation.      The reason given was the defection of some supporters:    with a very, small majority, the loss of a few votes was sufficient to upset the Government, but the causes of the defection are not clear.      The Congress leader of the opposition has obtained permission of the High Command to form a coalition ministry but, here again, the close division of the parties is a handicap, and it is not yet certain that he will succeedOf Congress provinces the Central Provinces has continued to provide plentiful matter for political controversy.      The fallen Premier, Dr. Khare, and his supporters are vigorous in denunciation both of their local opponents and of the High Command, and entertain hopes of upsetting the new Ministry in the Assembly.      An elaborate statement by the Congress President is the latest contribution to this unedifying dispute within the party. The - ne/w Ministry has still not completed its numbers.. To enforce tfcieir demand for representation in the Cabinet the Harijans    (depressed.classes) have used against GandhiConfidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated 21st September, 1938, issued on the -   authority of the Secretary of State for India.
2,his own weapon of Satyagraha by descending in batches on his home and fasting outside it.      The stability of the Ministry will be tested in the Assembly Session which has just begun.2*     Provineial-Administration.    The Government in Bengal completed by the end of August their remarkable record of releases of all detenus and State prisoners.      Consultation has been proceeding with the Congress President, Subhas Bose, about the release of the terrorist convicts but no decision has been announced.In Madras the anti-Hindi agitation is dying down. More than 250 arrests had been made by the end of August. The opposition has attempted to exploit the use of a &quot;repressive&quot; law in dealing with-the agitation, but the Government had no difficulty in defeating In the Assembly a resolution disapproving of their policy or in throwing out. a Bill for the repeal of the obnoxious law.      Their success has been purchased by what is widely condemned in Congress circles and acclaimed elsewhere as a betrayal of sound Congress doctrine.     This province is one of the Jew in which something has been done to remove the secular disabilities of the depressed classes.      It was left to a private member to introduce a Bill with the object of removing these disabilities in regard to appointments to public office and access to public wells etc., privileges which were previously denied to them;    this Bill has been passed.      Another Bill to give them the right of entry into the temples was rejected but the Government promised to introduce similar legislation to be applied in one district only.In Bombay the Government have introduced in the Legislature a Trades Disputes Bill.-   &quot;This,  as aiming to make strikes illegal until arbitration has been tried, is
unpopular with the Left-Wing:    and a Tenancy Bill, more moderate than might &quot;be expected from a Congress Ministry, is criticised from different angles &quot;by both land-holders and. tenants.A Bill has &quot;been published which provides machinery for resuming from the present holders lands which were confiscated and sold for non-payment of land revenue in the civil disobedience campaign of 1931.      A modicum of compensation is provided, for and the lands will be restored to the Congress stalwarts who were then dispossessed.In the United Provinces, the Tenancy Bill is still with. Select Committee.   . The Council, meeting at the end of August&quot;, has once again disagreed with the Assembly over - amendments made to important Bills mentioned in previous appreciations:    the difficulty will apparently have to be solved by a joint session..  In Bihar, the agrarian leader, Swami Sahajanand and his lieutenants, still pursue their aim of fostering discontent by violent speaking:   but poor attendance at recent demonstrations seems to show a weakening of extremist influence, .In the Punjab, the attempts of the non-agricultural classes to work up feeling against measures designed to benefit agriculturists have been over-shadowed by enthusiastic rallies- in support of the legislation.      The audience addressed by Premier at Lyallpur on September 4th is estimated at 50,000 persons.      Two bills have received the assent of the Governor, and a third has been reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General.Meanwhile,  the dissensions in the Ccngress party in this Province have produced a split which will not he easily bridged.
3*      Labour calls for little remark.      In Assam, an attempt is being made to create, or exploit, dissatisfaction amongst workers in tea gardens.      Strikes continue in Bombay (Gokak mills) and in Bihar and the Central, Provinces.      In the.labour organisation at Cawnpore, recent elections have given the communists a preponderating influence.4&apos;      Communal troubles have caused some anxiety in various parts of India.      In Bihar,  the right of Moslems to kill cattle has been asserted in a manner which made it necessary in one area to issue a prohibitory order.      An agitation against the order has at times threatened disturbance of the peace.The tribal raid on Bannu in the North West Frontier Province described in the last appreciation was the cause of communal tension in that city.      The Provincial -Government have appointed two committees, to report on the situation generally and to go into the question of compensation to be paid to the victims.In the United Provinces, there have been&apos;two Hindu Moslem clashes.    In Fyzabad district, on August 21st, the police had to open fire on a crowd of Moslems;    no one was killed.      In Allahabad, on August 28th, the passage of a Hindu procession near a Moslem mosque at prayer time caused a riot, in which 3 persons were killed and 15 injured.In Delhi,  the claim of a Sadhu (ascetic) to conduct worship in a corner of a public garden led to a dispute which has aroused communal passion.      Attempts to eject the Sadhu caused an agitation amongst the Hindus and counter claims on the part of the Moslems.      The demonstrations of the Hindu faction became disorderly and many arrests were made.     After prolonged negotiations a settlement was strrived at, and accepted by the Chief Commissioner, on September 3rd.      On the morning of September 9th,  the Sadhu was stabbed by a.
Moslem.     A crowd of Hindus at once collected and used violence both against Moslems and against the police. The situation was threatening for a while:    but the police3 with, troops standing by, restored order. Occupation of the disputed site has for the present been forbidden, and the city is now quiet.5o      Palestine.    The leaders of the main Moslem crgan-isation in India,  the Moslem League, have hitherto refrained from encouraging agitation against the British policy in Palestine:    in accordance with a resolution of the League,  &quot;Palestine Lay&quot; was observed on August 26th, but without much display.The natural sympathy of the Moslems with the Arabs in Palestine is, however, liable to be turned into anti-British channels by propaganda conducted loy sections of the community,  including such as aim at discrediting&apos;the League: and a threat has been made of a civil disobedience campaign&apos; to begin after the World Islamic Conference in Cairo on October 7th,  if the Conference fails to achieve satisfactory results.      Moslem opponents of the League have also made capital out of the League&apos;s support of the Bill passed in the Central Assembly to penalise propaganda against recruitment in the Army.6&apos;      2Lfo:g.^Pl3n&apos;fcr&apos;Ql Legislature continues in session.      In both Chambers great interest has been shown in Defence affairs.In the Assembly the debate on the Bill designed to penalise anti-recruiting propaganda lasted for 4 days; some of the speeches from the Congress benches were in tone- similar to the propaganda conducted outside the H^use which the Bill is intended to check.      The Moslem League Party decided to support the Bill, and it was passed oh August 24th with certain amendments,, moved by the Moslem
.... 476.League members.      It was passed by the Council of State without further amendment,A resolution in the Assembly asking for a Committee to review the progress made at the Indian Military Academy, with a view to deciding whether acceleration of Indianisation is warranted, was accepted in principle by the Government. Another resolution prep, sing a Committee to examine financial control of military expenditure was carried against the Government.      The announcement of His Majesty&apos; s Governments intention to give financial assistance to the Government of India in various matters relating to the Army was received without marked enthusiasm in the Assembly, but more favourably in the Council of State.      In both Houses, there have been many questions demanding information on military matters. In the Council of State, a resolution demanding a Standing Committee to advise on defence policy was defeated:    another which recommended that the scheme for increasing the pay and amenities of the British Service in India should not be given effect to,  was withdrawn after discussion:,   and a third, asking for increased recruitment to the Army from Madras and other areas, which do not at present contribute a large number of recruits, was defeated.The main legislative business in the Assembly has been the passing of an elaborate and comprehensive Motor Vehicles Bill.      An adjournment motion, expressing concern about, the recent rioting in Burma, was carried without division.      It has been announced that an agent of the Government of India is being sent to Burma immediately.There  are pending in both Houses private Bills dealing with divorce and. polygamy, which show a desire to reform the marriage laws of Indian communities.17&apos;      General..      Floods have caused much damage in the United Provinces.     The situation in Assam and Bengal has
improved.      The failure of the monsoon in a part of the Punjab is^causing anxiety.      Elsewhere, prospects are normal.On August 21st,  there was a serious railway accident near Trichinipoly in the Madras Presidency.      A train was thrown off an embankment which had been breached by a cloud-burstj    32 persons were killed and 78 injured.8.     Wa^irlstaru    There has been no important change in the situation during the month.      The faqir of Ipi&apos;s efforts to establish a fresh base for his operations in British Tribal territory have been frustrated by immediate air proscription of the areas in which he has appeared.      In consequence he has spent a large part of his time in Afghan Tribal territory in the vicinity of the Durand Line.      On September 10th he -was reported to have returned to British Tribal area.    - His followers have been responsible for several minor raids into the adjoining districts of Kohat, Bannu. and Dera Ismail Khan in the course of which British subjects have been kidnapped and property looted.      In fa.ziristan while there   has been no incident of major importance small gangs have continued their aptivities. Troops have been sniped in camp and on the march;    civilian lorries held up and passengers kidnapped-    communications damaged and bombs planted on roads and parade grounds,
