The memorandum which follows has been prepared accordingly.2. The Committee of Imperial Defence also decided that the Cabinet should have before them concurrently a memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 1472-B) on the German aircraft industry.   This has now been circulated as CP. 222 (38).3. It was further agreed that the Cabinet&apos;s attention should be drawn to the view of the Committee of Imperial Defence that this country could not be regarded as safe until the Royal Air Force and the anti-aircraft defences had been increased and its passive defence arrangements had been substantially improved.The Present Situation.4. I should remind my colleagues that we are specifically pledged to Parlia-ment to the production by April 1939 of a first-line Metropolitan strength of 1,750 aircraft, with provision for the necessary reserves. Actually, so far as can be foreseen, the first-line strength due for completion by this date will be slightly exceeded though not all the first-line aircraft will be of latest types. There will be only a limited reserve of aircraft behind this force and an even more limited reserve of trained crews.5. The programme now governing the expansion of the Royal Air Force aims at increasing the Metropolitan strength by April 1940 to a total of 2,373t first-line aircraft, including 1,352 bombers and 640 fighters, together with the necessary reserves.6fc On the 27th April, 1938, the Cabinet! took note &quot; of the estimate of the aircraft industry that 12,000 aeroplanes could be produced within the next two years,&quot; and authorised the Air Ministry &quot; to accept as many aeroplanes as they could obtain up to the maximum of 12,000 in the next two years.&quot; Parliament was informed that, if the necessary labour were available, our programme of* C.I.D. Minutes of 333rd Meeting.\ The substitution of two Fighter Squadrons for two Army Co-operation Squadrons on a lower establishment has raised the total by 8 first-line aircraft to a total of 2,381.

production would allow of the attainment by March 1940 of a Metropolitan first-line strength of 2,370 aircraft, in addition to an overseas first-line strength of approximately 490 aircraft, with in each case the necessary reserves. It was also accepted by the Cabinet that provision should be made for the entry and training of the necessary personnel, both regular and non-regular, and Parliament was informed that the strength of the Royal Air Force would be increased by 40,000 men in the period up to March 1940.7. It will be noted that the programme authorised by the Cabinet in April last was dictated mainly by what were then considered to be the limitations of aircraft production and was not related to the possible German air strength by the date when it was due for completion.8. As a guide to future action, it is desirable to be able to compare the strength of our own air force with that of Foreign Powers at some future date; and since it is a matter of years before a new programme, once started, can be fully implemented, a comparison at a near date alone is not of much value; on the other hand, the inevitable margin of error in any forecast of the air strengths of Foreign Powers may be excessive if based on too distant a view. The information which we can obtain regarding Germany&apos;s actual strength, her capacity for production and expansion and her future intentions, leaves much to be desired. While there is no reasonable doubt that we have made an almost complete identification of the number of her first-line units and their strength in numbers, we are by no means sure of their bomb-load at long ranges. Equally, we cannot be at all confident that our assessment of stored reserve aircraft resulting from our estimates of German production is a true one : we know that German reserve policy two years ago was to maintain 100 per cent, reserves, but we cannot be sure that it is still being adhered to. As regards future intentions, we have some evidence of a plan for considerable expansion which we are confident can be fulfilled and will be fulfilled if it has not been superseded on which point we are in doubt. Our estimates in regard to Germany are therefore guided by the steady trend of known expansion since 1935 towards the plan referred to, supported by what we know of the increasing potentiality of the German aircraft industry to meet that programme and provide for rapid expansion on the outbreak of war.9. Because of our uncertainty not only of Germany&apos;s intentions but also of Russia&apos;s, and of the expansion capacities of the other countries concerned, I have felt it unwise to take our estimates beyond April 1940, and I show below how we estimate our strength in aircraft (including reserves) will compare with that of other nations at various dates between now and then, excluding ship-borne aircraft:  Present.

It is expected that the announced programme for Italian strength will not be appreciably exceeded, and that any additional capacity for expansion will be used to augment reserves:(c) Includes 800 obsolete bombers.   60. per cent, of the Russian air force is obsolete.
10., The allocation, among the various classes of aircraft, of the figures of British and German first-line aircraft and reserves given in the above table will probably be as follows at April 1940 :-Situation at April 1, 1940, by Classes of Aircraft..                          .

It is necessary to sound a note of warning on the all-important question of reserves. The assessment of reserves of aircraft in foreign air forces is not only largely conjectural, but is complicated by the fact that a large proportion of all European air forces, except Germany&apos;s, is equipped at the present time with obsolescent aircraft, which are in process of accelerated replacement. The replacement of obsolescent aircraft will tend to swell the available reserve of old types without correspondingly increasing the value of the total reserves in war. Our own reserve figures given in this paper include no obsolescent aircraft after the 1st August, 1939. Further, figures of aircraft in reserve have obviously no meaning except in relation to the number of reserve crews available to man them. Our own reserve aircraft shown in the tables above will not be fully matched with the equivalent number of trained reserve crews by the dates shown, but, by the 1st April, 1940, crews for a substantial proportion of our reserve aircraft, at least in the Fighter Command, will be available and the position will show a marked improvement by the summer of that year. We have reason to believe that Germany is, at present, similarly placed, but her position is rapidly improving, and, by the 1st April, 1940, her reserves in aircraft should be fully matched by an equivalent number of crews trained to reserve standards. France and Italy cannot fully jnatch their reserve aircraft with crews, and are unlikely to be able to during the period under review. We have no reliable information with regard to the reserve-crew position in Russia.12. A final point of importance in comparing our strength with that of Germany is that in the German first-line squadrons there is normally no excess of regular flying personnel over and above the first-line aircraft crews; but the German policy is definitely to operate only 75 per cent, of the first-line strength shown in the tables^ the remaining 25 per cent, forming, in effect, a reserve kept with the units.   On the same basis as Germany, we only expect, owing to the
technical requirements of maintenance, to be able to operate continuously 75 per cent, of our first-line strength. But we feel that even this proportion could not operate continuously at the high rate of intensity and wastage that we envisage in the opening stages of a war unless some additional provision is made in personnel. . Accordingly, our authorised establishments provide for the eventual inclusion of extra regular trained crews, on a scale 25 per cent, in excess of the first-line strength in aircraft. This will give our squadrons a valuable advantage over those of our potential enemies by enabling them to maintain a higher initial rate of operations in the face of casualties. To this extent, the figures of first-line strength for our own and foreign air forces in 1940 are not fairly comparable and tend to exaggerate the disparity between our own first-line strength and that of Germany.13. A further vital component of air strength is the capacity of the aircraft industry of the country concerned. There is no reasonable doubt that the German industry* can reach the rates of monthly output of military types shown in the table below. If these prove to be in excess of actual output, this will probably be because they are in excess of requirements. The figures given for Italy may prove to be too high because of economic difficulties, and those for France because of industrial difficulties. The figures for Russia show little change because there is no indication of intended expansion or new capacity for increased production. The fact stands out that Germany is industrially well able to provide for her expected expansion : her prevailing shortage of skilled labour is a limiting factor for rapid expansion of output, not for a continuation of her past steady progress.Estimated, Monthly Output of Military Aircraft.Present.       1.4.39. 1.8.39. 1.4.40.Germany ... 600 700 800 900Italy     ... ... 200 225 250 300France   ... ... 120 150 200 300Russia... ... 470 480 490 500The present output in Great Britain is about 300 a month, which should rise to about 500 a month by April 1939 and possibly 800 a month by April 1940.14. In comparing British and German output figures, two points should: be borne in mind. The first is that the German figures are believed to represent a planned expansion of output for which plant and labour are and will be adequate on, in general, a one-shift 44-hour week basis; but, if required by the projected increase in her first-line strength, or by other circumstances, there is nothing to prevent an increase in output by the 1st March, 1940, to 1,100 a month, if necessary resorting to some measure of double-shift, working. Single-shift working is the basis of their peace-time production and, so far, it has been adhered to with few exceptions. The British plant is not, and will not be,, able before 1940 to meet our requirements on a one-shift basis; till then, two-shifts will be nearer the general rule. The second point, which to some extent offsets this first disadvantage, is that our production figure for 1940 will include a proportion of heavy bombers which, it is believed, will be able to carry a very much greater bomb-load than that of German bombers then in production. The disparity in production in Germany&apos;s favour shown in the table above conceals this important fact.15. To achieve equality in air striking power with Germany does not necessarily involve matching every German bomber with one of our own, but it does mean that our striking force must be capable of delivering at least an equal load of bombs at the required range;    The policy of the British Air Staff aims at* See Appendix, which is a supplementary note to the latest report on the German Aircraft Industry (C.I.D. Paper No. 1472^-B) circulated separately by the Minister for Go-ordination of Defence as CP. 222 (38). ...
developing the large high-performance bombert capable of carrying very heavy bomb loads and a formidable defensive armament, while from our present informa-tion it appears that German policy is to distribute bombing capacity among a larger number of aircraft with smaller loads. Our present authorised programme thus involves the progressive replacement of the medium bomber class which, as explained in paragraph 27 below was introduced as an interim type in the Qarly stages of expansion, with heavy bombers of greatly superior bomb load and range. By the 1st April, 1939, twenty-four squadrons (288 aircraft) should be equipped with heavy bombers; this number should rise to forty-four squadrons by April 1940, and ultimately by 1943 no squadrons of the medium class, should be left. Our requirements in other classes of aircraft are determined by factors other than Germany&apos;s strength in corresponding classes. Our first-line strength in General Reconnaissance aircraft and Flying Boats is dictated by the requirements of Naval Co-operation and the protection of our sea-borne trade, and the number of the Army Co-operation squadrons depends upon the requirements of the Field Force. As regards fighters, the number required is related to the strength of the German long-range bombers, and has been the subject of a special review during the past three months, as a result of which it is certain that our requirements will involve an increase from 640 first-line fighters on the programme now authorised to a total of not less than 800.16. I have already emphasised the fact that the numbers of aircraft in first-line squadrons in peace are no criterion of our true air strength in war. It is obvious that if our war effort in the air is not to decline rapidly from the outset, we must have adequate reserves both of aircraft and personnel. The calculation of what we require in these respects for a future war is based on a number of factors, many of which are almost entirely conjectural. We have, for instance, no experience of air operations on a modern scale between two first-class Powers, with the result that our estimates of operational effort and wastage (which determine the strength of the reserves required) may well be proved wrong in the event. Nor can we assess with any certainty the rate of production of modern aircraft or of highly-trained crews under war conditions, when both our aircraft industry and training establishments are likely to be subject to enemy air attack and constant air raid warnings. A detailed review of our requirements which has recently been completed has, however, made clear, first, that the period before the industry can overtake our anticipated rates of wastage in highly complex modern aircraft will at least be considerably longer than we had estimated; and, secondly, that our requirements in trained reserve crews in peace and from the war training organisation in war will be of a very high order, to meet which it will be necessary to adopt special measures on the lines indicated later in this paper.17. The future expansion of our air strength must therefore, it is submitted, be based on the provision of adequate reserves of ahcraft and trained personnel; and the rate at which we can increase the proportion of our first-line squadrons that can be operated in war will be conditioned by that factor. We must make every effort to escape from the position in which we found ourselves during the recent crisis when we had less than one week&apos;s reserves behind the squadrons; this would have resulted in a rapidly declining scale of effort, especially in the Fighter Squadrons.   This does not mean that the number of regular unitsf The following table summarizes the difference in value between the future types now in view-and those with which the Air Force is at present equipped: 	Top Speed.

maintained in peace should be reduced^-indeed, if anything, the reverse. ; We shall make every effort to increase the reserve of aircraft and it will aiso be necessary to compensate in some degree for our deficiencies in reserve personnel by building up as soon as possible a reserve within the regular Service in the form of advanced training pools. But it does mean thatuntihour full reserve require-ments in aircraft and trained crews are available, it will continue to be necessary to &quot;roll-up &quot; a proportion of our first-line bomber squadrons on mobilization in order to provide the minimum essential reserves behind the others.      :The A cceleration of Production.18. Turning now to the problem of aircraft production, it should be recalled that of the total of 12,000 aircraft authorised by the Cabinet last April to be ordered for delivery to the Royal Air Force during the ensuing two years, 4,000 were to be delivered in 1938 and 8,000 in 1939.19. Repeated delays in deliveries made it clear early this summer that special steps would have to be taken to reorganise and direct production if this pro-gramme was to be fulfilled. Detailed and expert analysis of the whole problem of production, from the manufacture of the materials to the final assembly of the completed aircraft, was required. Two main facts have been made clear by this analysis : first, that labour, more than anything else, is the limiting factor in the acceleration of production; there are limits (varying in different areas) to the rate at which labour can be secured, trained and absorbed into the productive organisation; secondly, that the professional aircraft industry, even when augmented by the Shadow Factories,^ although capable in its own judgment of meeting the demand, would not in fact be able to make good its forecasts.20. To concentrate the whole of the required labour force at the assembly shops of; the aircraft firms would have been impracticable on grounds of delay and cost-quite apart from other difficulties and the general principle has been adopted of taking the work to the sources of labour by means of sub-contracting on as large a scale as possible. I have instructed aircraft firms that, as a minimum, 35 per cent, of their production as measured in man-hours should be put out to sub-contractors and this is being done. New organisations now being started for aircraft production by Vickers Armstrong, Metropolitan-Vickers and English Electric will carry this further and are being planned on the basis of central assembly shops fed by a flow of components from associated sub-contracting firms.21. The extent to which sub-contracting widens the field of production will be readily appreciated, as will also the fact that the fresh capacity obtained is relatively quickly available and does not involve the State in large capital commitments. Expert managerial and supervisory staffs are available in the sub-contracting firms and the further enlistment and training of workers are secured by carrying the work to firms which already have the labour and would otherwise, in many cases, be discharging it.22. The productive capacity of the aircraft industry itself is being further increased by large extensions of the works of, e.g,, Bristols, Glosters, A. V. Roe, Faireys and Short Bros., and the industry is being further strengthened by association with some of the principal engineering organisations, e.g., Short. Bros, with Harlands, Blackburn with Denny, Westlands with John Brown, and by the control of Vickers Aviation and Supermarines by Vickers Armstrong. Some of these steps are very recent. Involving, as they do, at least the provision of new assembly shops, the manufacture and installation of: jigs and tools, and the setting in motion of a whole chain of sub-contractors, they cannot be expected, tp give effective production in much less than 18 months.23, Concurrently, with the extension of airframe production, steps have been taken to extend the capacity for the manufacture of engines, various components and accessories, and of armament equipment. The erection of new engine works to supplement the capacity of Rolls Royce and of new factories for the manufac-ture of carburettors and airscrews, the organisation of quantity production of automatic pilots by Metro-Vickers and, of Browning machine guns by B.S.A., are, .:* The &quot; shadow &quot; organisation has recently been enlarged by enlisting the co-operation of Lord Nuffield,-who wihoperate a new factory at.Birmingham for the provision of ^Fighter aircraft.
examples of what has been done. Similar action has been taken to provide capacity for the production of materials with-a view to securing additional sources of supply and fabrication. The problem of maintaining a proper balance between the multifarious requirements from industry as a whole is under constant review, and it is clear that further measures may be needed. In particular, I have-in mind the need for ensuring adequate supplies of the constituents of 100 octane fuel in order that we may be able to get high speed performance from our aircraft. I have set up a small Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Harold Hartley to investigate and report on this problem, and it appears inevitable that further substantial expenditure will be necessary to develop a fuel supply organisation which will be adequate to meet the war needs of the Royal Air Force.24. The total capital liability, immediate or contingent, involved to the Exchequer by the measures to increase productive capacity taken since April last, and by certain measures which await the final approval of the Treasury, is approximately  M16. Some additional projects will be necessary, but I am hopeful that by utilising the existing capacity of the engineering industry on the principle of taking the work to the men, it may be possible to avoid setting up additional factories for aircraft production other than for assembly purposes  on any large scale.Proposals for A additional Aircraft.25. The present labour force employed on airframe production needs to be trebled during the next twelve months, and that employed by the regular industry alone needs to be more than doubled if the required rate of production is to be achieved. The present rate of increase in the industry now stands at about 8 per cent, per month. It must be emphasised that it is only by orders and orders on a long-range programme that the required labour force can be built up and kept working at high pressure. If, for example, the orders now held by a factory working at high pressure were due to end in, say, April 1940, and follow-on orders had not been given or had not been given at a sufficiently early stage, there would not only be a big gap and loss of labour before a further order resulted in production, but there would inevitably be a slowing down in output before April 1940.26. In order to build up our increased productive capacity and the requisite labour force, it has been necessary to place orders for delivery after April 1940, and therefore in excess of the orders which will give delivery by that date of the 12,000 aircraft authorised by the Cabinet. With the approval of the Treasury, a total of 17,500 aircraft has been ordered (including two special orders each for 1,000 Fighter aircraft): of these, 5,500 will fall to be delivered &apos;. after the 1st April, 1940. These orders, in addition, will equip the Service as rapidly as possible with types that are now available for rapid production.27. Hitherto, in the expansion of the Royal Air Force, we have been compelled to adopt for large-scale production the types which were immediately available; only by so doing could the existing sources of production be developed quickly. This step, however, has two disadvantages; it prevents the reduction in the number of types which is desirable, and it involves equipping many squadrons with aircraft of which the operational value is limited in one or other important respect, e.g., range or bomb load. &apos;-   &apos;28. I feel that it is of the utmost importance that these two weaknesses should be remedied as soon as possible, and I have the following proposals to lay before my colleagues. They contemplate a further development of the policy of associating firms into a number of production groups, and of limiting the number of types of aircraft to be produced. Each main group will concentrate on one. type, or, at most, on two. * ,.- ,     ,-      * Group A will build &quot; Manchester &quot;bomber aircraft and include as its principal&quot; firms- the ,A.: y.-.

Smaller groups will be created to -undertake other types of- aircraft.   Firms which cannot be brought . into the group form &apos; of organisation will continue, with other sub-contractors, as separate manufacturing --uhitsv-&apos;---&quot;-V-
29. As regards Fighter types, I propose to concentrate production on two-fixed-gun types and one free-gun type; actual selection will depend on flight trials during the next few months. As regards Bombers, I propose quantity produc-tion of two four-engined types, the Short &quot; Stirling &quot; and the Handley Page &quot; Halifax,&quot;&quot;Tind one twin-engined type, the Avro &quot;Manchester,&quot;! . ;80. In order to re-equip the Service as quickly as possible and to maintain production at the required pitch, I propose to work to a programme which will include these main types in the following numbers:  ; .; 3,700 Fighters. &apos;1,500 &quot; Manchester.&quot; 1,500 &quot; Stirling.&quot; 500 &quot; Halifax.&quot;t31. The programme will also include a total of about 4,800 other aircraft,, including a general purpose (metal and wood) bomber, and also General Reconnaissance, Army Co-operation and Fleet Air Arm types and aircraft indispensable for training. These additional numbers, together with those of the fighters and bombers referred to above, will bring the total programme to approxi-mately 12,000 aircraft for delivery before April 1942. For some of the types included in the programme jigs and tools are already in an advanced state.32. For the present, I ask authority to order half the number of bomber and fighter aircraft specified above, with a similar proportion, to be settled in detail with the Treasury, of the other types mentioned. On this basis, the orders for the -placing of which I now seek authority are :  1,850 Fighters.750 &quot; Manchester.&quot; ;750 &quot;Stirling.&quot;250 &quot;Halifax.&quot; 2,400 Other types.33. It is essential that at least these orders should be placed at a very early-date if we are to have any chance of equalling the German capacity for produc-tion. They are also essential if the Service is to be re-equipped as soon as possible on a scale that may raise our striking-power to a level of that of Germany.34. It is clear that in our previous programmes of expansion we have not taken a sufficiently long range view and have under-estimated both the capacity and intentions of Germany. For reasons which I set out in some detail in para-graph 52 below, I consider it essential that we should put ourselves now in a position to take prompt action in the future to increase our strength should the need arise. It will be too late to do so if we defer our preparations until the need has actually arisen. This involves planning for further production by arranging for the provision at once of the necessary jigs, tools and materials for the balance of the programme described in paragraph 30&apos; above, and I ask the i authority of the Cabinet to instruct the industry accordingly. I am satisfied that the capacity of the industry will be adequate for the programme now envisaged for the years 1940-42.*35. An important effect of the orders proposed in paragraph 32 above will be to hasten production on existing orders and thereby improve to a marked extentt See footnote to paragraph 15, page 5. - j In addition to 100 Halifax aircraft which it is hoped to obtain from.Canada in 1942 under the scheme which the Cabinet have recently approved for the creation of productive capacity in that Dominion.* It is important to bear in mind the desirability of the aircraft industry being in a position to undertake orders for the supply of aircraft of up-to-date design to the Dominions and to foreign countries, particularly those to whom we have Treaty obligations. Clearly, this can only be achieved without detriment to the Royal Air Force if the industry has a capacity that is larger than is needed to meet the bare requirements of this country. This emphasises the desirability of planning our future production oh generous lines, so that if it is necessary to increase our own . programme at a future date this can be achieved without it being necessary either to interfere with delivery programmes already agreed with the Dominions or foreign countries,, or to restrict the acceptance of further overseas orders. : r&quot;i; .&apos;   ,.
the situation.in 1940. By-that date, however, our strength will not be equal to that of Germany indeed, we shall have made but a limited advance in that direction, a situation which these orders are designed to rectify. A further con-sideration of immediate importance is that aircraft firms are already asking for further orders to maintain the flow of production, both of fighters and bombers, and, unless such orders are given, not only will there be a retardation of the pro-duction now in hand but skilled tradesmen will actually have to be discharged, particularly by sub-contractors^ in the near future.36. Hitherto, it has not been necessary to ask for abnormal powers to ensure that labour and manufacturing facilities are devoted, in adequate measure, to our rearmament programme. I do not consider that it should be necessary in peace time to take any abnormal steps regarding labour, though difficulties may arise with the unions in the matter of demarcation. Difficulties may also occur in ensuring that a sufficient degree of priority is given to essential rearmament work by the toolmaking and possibly other trades. The question whether any powers for the control of production should be taken raises many issues which will no doubt be considered as a general problem by my colleagues.37. It is also for consideration whether we should further enlist the resources of the American aircraft industry. The Mission which visited the U.S.A. earlier this year found that the American types of fighter and bomber aircraft were generally inferior in performance to the types coming into production in this country. For this, amongst other reasons, the 400 American aircraft ordered, were confined to General Reconnaissance and Training types. With the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I have recently supple-mented this order by 50 General Reconnaissance aircraft. I am now exploring actively the desirability of other orders, with the object of securing the rapid delivery of aircraft of a kind we require and the release of capacity in this country for the production of other aircraft urgently needed. This raises large issues of policy on which I should propose to consult my colleagues in due course.The Cabinet have recently approved proposals which I submitted for developing the production capacity of Canada.Scientific Research.38. Valuable progress has been made in recent years in scientific research and development affecting all aspects of air defence. I attach great importance to the fullest possible acceleration of this work, and I am sure that I can count on the support of my colleagues in any measures that may be necessary to further it.Development and Organisation of our Air Strength.39. I have set out in the following table our estimates of the war strength of the Metropolitan air force at various dates between now and the 1st April, 1942, which we hope to attain with the additional resources in aircraft thafshould be at our disposal as a result of the measures outlined above. The figures for the 1st April, 1940, and summer 1941 are to some extent conjectural, and, the former, in particular will necessitate special efforts within the next 18 months to increase the provision of trained reserve crews.

40. The situation thus disclosed, though it shows a progressive improvement over that obtaining to-day, Will be definitely unsatisfactory throughout the next 12 months, particularly as regards Fighters. We shall still be engaged in.the re-equipment of our fighter squadrons with Hurricanes and Spitfires, in the production of which, particularly the Spitfire, there have been serious setbacks, of which my colleagues are aware. The process of re-equipment inevitably means that until the first-line squadrons are fully equipped with the new type wo cannot accumulate reserves, while the old types thrown up on re-equipment have to be used for training purposes.41. Steps are being taken to improve the fighter &quot;position by rearming, as a temporary measure, three squadrons with Blenheim medium bombers fitted with a total of 6 Browning guns. &quot; This greatly increased fire power should make these aircraft, already of high performance, into formidable fighters, when certain technical difficulties have been surmounted. Arrangements are also being made whereby at least seven more squadrons of Blenheims will be provided with the necessary guns and fittings to enable them to be used in the alternative role of multigun fighter should they be required: This, of course, can only be done at the expense of our counter-offensive, but I feel -and in this I have the full agreement of the Air Staff that until we have achieved the minimum standard of fighter strength this course is inevitable. -42. There are in addition five regular army co-operation squadrons which will shortly be fully equipped with an aircraft, the Lysander, of definite value as a two-seater fighter. These squadrons would be available for employment in the more remote sectors of the fighter line in the event of war occurring before the expansion of the Fighter Command is completed with the necessary reserves.43. Thus, in an extreme emergency, it would be possible to reinforce the number of fighters shown in the table: above by a total of 164 aircraft of by no means negligible Value. Moreover, while there will be no appreciable stored reserves&apos; of fighters before the end of 1939, there would be, in war, some output from the industry, and the measures described below are designed to ensure that sufficient trained reserve pilots will be available to man these aircraft:   ;;. - ? -44. By the beginning of 1940, the limiting factor in the number of squadrons we can mobilise becomes the provision of trained crews instead of the production of aircraft. We are concentrating our efforts, in the first instance, on providing an adequate reserve of trained pilots behind the fighter squadrons,&quot; and these squadrons have been allotted the first call on our training organisation, both Regular and Reserve, with the object of matching the supply! of reserve fighter aircraft as they become available with equivalent numbers of reserve fighter pilots. Until these numbers become available, extra regular pilots will be allocated to the Fighter Command at the expense of the Bomber Squadrons, Which will therefore for some time be dependent almost entirely upon their own Regular personnel. The necessity for &quot;rolling up &quot; regular Bomber Squadrons to find reserves for others explains the difference between our peace. first-line and war strengths; the situation in this respect will show a marked and increasing improvement during the summer of .1940, by which, time the Reserve Training organisation should be showing substantial results. ..45. In accordance with the policy mentioned in paragraph 17 above, the future development of the Air Force would be based on the following general plan.46. We cannot assume that we shall not have to go to war before our programme is completed in every respect, but must take into account the possibility of another crisis occurring at any time within the next two years. We must face the.facts that our ground A.A. defences, guns, searchlights and balloons cannot be made up to the full scale for some time to come, and that our arrangements for passive defence and the organisation to fit the country to withstand air attack, though they have made marked progress in the past few months, have not as yet reached a very advanced stage.47.   For the present, therefore, I propose to give priority to building upi our fighter force as soon as possible with fully adequate reserves both of aircraft and personnel, and to aim at as high an output of fighter aircraft in war;as can be secured from that section of the industry devoted to the production of fighter [18101] - ^ E
aircraft. - As a general indication, the orders for which I am&apos; now asking immediate authority should enable us to build up our first-line fighter force to a total: of 640 aircraft, backed by substantial reserves, by the 1st April, 1940. Subsequently the first line will be increased to the required strength of approxi-mately 800, and finally the whole force will be made up to the full scale of reserves required, which I anticipate will be possible by the Spring of 1941. The arrangements for the provision of trained fighter personnel will be developed pari passu with the foregoing programme for the provision of aircraft.48. I therefore request the immediate authority of the Cabinet to increase as soon as possible pur first-line strength, in fighters from the 640 authorised in the present programme to a total of 800, together with the necessary reserves in aircraft and personnel, and to make provision for the necessary accommodation;49. On the assumption that the full scale of ground anti-aircraft defences are provided, that the organisation of the country for passive defence against air attack is undertaken on a scale commensurate with the development of bur active defences, and that an adequate counter-offensive striking force is available, I am satisfied that: so far as fighters are concerned the orders for which I am now asking authority^ will provide, when completed, adequate protection against the heaviest scale of attack that can reasonably be anticipated on the information at present available of the strength and intentions of any potential enemy.50. Turning to our bomber programme, I need not enlarge on the fact that a powerful counter-offensive striking force is an essential element of any sound system of air defence, as well as a strong deterrent in peace and a very effective means of bringing pressure to bear on an enemy in war. That fact is self-evident.51. The development of the bomber force must, however, necessarily be slower than that of the fighters. The orders for which I am asking the immediate authority of the Cabinet, combined with those already placed, should enable us to replace most of the older and less efficient interim types in the striking force, and to provide substantial though not fully adequate reserves behind the bomber squadrons, by the Summer of 1941. Later in that year we should be able to increase these reserves to a scale which would enable us to maintain our effort for a reasonable period; while the increased capacity, for the preliminary develop-ment of which I am asking authority in paragraph 34 above, will provide the means of securing a substantial output to replace wastage in war, or alternatively a basis for a further increase in strength should that become necessary. No bomber force is likely to be able to maintain indefinitely its rate of operational effort at the same level as that possible in the opening weeks of war, and it is in fact unlikely to be practicable to provide for heavy bombers a scale of reserves or war potential corresponding to that behind the fighters. I am, however, satisfied that somewhat lower standards can be accepted with reasonable safety. The provision of reserves and potential of trained personnel, bombs, fuel, &amp;c, will be developed to keep pace with this programme of aircraft production..52. I have already stressed the dangers of comparing estimates of our own and foreign air strengths, based, as they inevitably are, largely upon incomplete information and unconfirmed hypotheses. Subject to this warning, however, I am able to say that, on the best information available at present, we estimate that if the orders for which I am now seeking authority in paragraph 32 above are completed by the time envisaged, our first-line striking force by the Summer of 1941 should, in the aggregate, be able to lift a load of bombs comparable to that of the German long-range striking force mentioned in paragraph 10, and at considerably longer ranges. I am bound to point out that we believe that this German striking force could be completed by the Spring of 1940 and that, for 4 some time to come, our bombing capacity will be considerably inferior to that of Germany. So, far as we know,.the Germans do not at present intend to develop the very heavy type of bomber a fact which underlines the need for preserving the utmost secrecy as to our own intentions in this respect; it is, however, not impossible that they may, before the Summer of 1941, re-equip at least a proportion of their striking force with aircraft of this type particularly if they get any good\ :*; Subject-to any -alteration resulting from the review referred to in paragraph 15, which will-be completed in the course of the next few days.
indication - of the performance of our own types now in course, of development. In addition, it would probably not be beyond their capacity to increase still further the first-line numbers of their bomber force in the same period. If these things occur, it will be necessary to match the expansion of German bombing strength and order the balance of the programme the foundations of which I am now asking authority to lay-by securing the necessary manufacturing. capacity; in labour, jigs, tools and materials. This would result in a further very substantial addition to our bombing strength, and I believe would establish it in a satisfactory position relative to any standard that can at present reasonably be. foreseen in the development of the German Air Force. Failure to do so, however, would again leave us in&quot; a position of pronounced inferiority in striking power if the Germans were to re-equip their Air Striking Force with heavy bombers.53. I must repeat that the limiting factor in our war strength by the end of next.year will no longer be the supply of aircraft, but the provision of crews to man them, particularly in the reserve. The problem of personnel, in relation to the very large-scale wastage which may occur in modern air warfare, will thus become of increasing importance as the aircraft situation improves. I do not anticipate, according to present indications, serious difficulty in securing the necessary regular personnel by voluntary means. It may be necessary, however, to offer additional special-duty allowances in order to attract certain classes of non-commissioned flying personnel in the requisite numbers. With an adequate flow of recruitment; the great problem is that of training, and, above all, of&apos; the very complex training required for bomber crews- pilots, observers capable of navigation and bomb-aiming, wireless operators, and air gunners. It is reason-able toassume that, by adopting suitable measures, as, for example, the temporary diversion of some regular squadrons to training duties, the required numbers of regular crews will be trained by the time they are required.54. So far as the R.A.F.V.R. is concerned, the numbers required, which are of the order of 25,000, including pilots, must be well within the resources of the country to provide. The training of R.A.F.V.R. crews is, however, a much more difficult problem, and, although these should become available in considerable numbers in the summer of 1940, exceptional measures will be required to accelerate this programme. The Volunteer Reserve must be provided, without any&quot; avoidable delay, with the aircraft, aerodromes and buildings it needs; it will,&apos; in any event, be given a call on the services of those regular squadrons temporarily diverted to training. This alone, however^ will not suffice. The most difficult members of the bomber crew to train are the observers and wireless operators. Keen as the volunteer reservists are, it is estimated that under the R.A.F.V.R. ; system--whereby the airman&apos;s training is limited to periodical attendance at town centres during the week and at aerodromes at weekends, with a period of 14 days&apos; training each year the training occupies, on an optimistic estimate, a period from three to four times as long as that required for the continuous training which is a feature of those conscript forces with which our strength is being compared. I have therefore under preparation a new scheme of Reserve enlistment, whereby the Reservist joins initially for a short period of continuous-service on full pay for training, the inducement being a bonus at the end of the period and a substantial retaining fee during his period of Reserve service.Overseas Squadrons,   r. . : .. .55. Experience during the crisis has shown that a greater degree of self-sufficiency in overseas commands is essential. proposals to increase the present authorised figures of 474 first-line aircraft in overseas commands to a total of 644 were submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence last year in Paper D.P. (P) 12, but were not then proceeded with. The essential requirements are now being reviewed in the light of recent experience, and I would ask for approval in principle for an increase in. our overseas strength as soon as may be practicable, subject to consideration in detail by the Committee of Imperial Defence.      . -&quot; &apos;. &apos;. -&apos;.&apos;        . -    &apos; &apos;&apos;.The Cost Involved.      &apos; -       .; -; - &quot; - (.t &apos;. 56. The cost of the proposals which I have outlined above is truly formidable, but no more so than the menace with which we are confronted.   Provided that
(3)(4) (5) (6)there is no substantial rise in prices,-it is estimated that the immediate orders for aircraft proposed will mean that Air Vote 3, which covers all technical and warlike equipment and supplies, will rise from the current year&apos;s figure of  M. 72 to figures of the order of  M. 115 in 1939,  M. 175 in 1940 and  M. 110 in 1941 while a material expenditure will remain to be met in the succeeding years. Very roughly, I tfiink this would mean that Air Estimates for the financial year 1939 (excluding the provision for Civil Aviation) would be of the order of  M. 195, for 1940 about  M. 245 and for 1941* about  M. 180. The figure for. the current year, including the Supplementary Estimate: voted in July last, is approximately M. 123.. - . .; - ;      1Concluding Observations. .. . [57.   To sum up, I ask approval:  - ;:(1) To undertake such further expansion of our aircraft manufacturing facilities as may be necessary to enable us to achieve equality of output with the German aircraft industry.

To provide for any necessary increases of personnel, works and material consequent upon the above proposals.58.   In submitting these proposals for the approval of my colleagues, it may be convenient if I briefly summarise the situation as I see it.... 59. ; The rate,of expansion that we have now achieved will enable us to fulfil our specific pledges to Parliament (as set out in paragraphs 4 to 6 above) in the matter of first-line strength, but it has not yet produced the scale of reserves in aircraft and aircraft crews necessary to allow the first line to operate at full intensity in the early months of war. Had we now been at war, the intensity of our effort in the air would have very rapidly declined as our aircraft and their crews became casualties; it would, on the most optimistic estimate, have been very many months before war production of aircraft and war training of crews would have enabled us to resume the minimum essential rate of war effort.60. Looking duly to the immediate &quot;future, force of circumstances, i.e., our present lack of reserves, compels us to conserve as far as possible our limited strength and accept, in the event of war, a scale of initial effort lower than is strategically ideal, but one which we shall be. able longer to maintain. This means that bur full&apos;first-line bomber strength would not be deployed; part of it would be held back to provide a reserve of aircraft and aircraft crews for the squadrons immediately engaged with the enemy. Such a course is one which can, in the last resort, be adopted in our Bomber force.; It is, however, not one that we can 4 adopt for the: Fighters, since in this sphere the rate of operations is determined entirely by the&quot;enemy, and&apos;we must be prepared to deploy our maximum available strength at the outset to provide against the possibility of an attempt at a knock- -out blow. In order to reduce to a minimum our weakness in Fighter strength, I have made proposals for diverting immediately as large as practicable a propor-- * This figure, is based on the actual orders for which authority is sought. In the&quot; event of the full, programme -not being&quot;-ultimately implemented,&apos;:-some -additional orders,- and therefore some additional expenditure, would be required in 1941 in order to keep the industry in being in that year. &apos;At In the event of unforeseen delays in bringing the new types into prodiictiori, some further orders of existing types may be necessary to avoid loss of output through gaps in production&apos;.
tion of our available resources to the increase of our Fighter first line and of the reserves behind it. And I am asking authority for an eventual increase in our first-line Fighter strength by the equivalent of ten squadrons.61. Looking further ahead, the central problem seems to me to be that of the production of aircraft; even the training of the much needed reserve crews depends on this, since the primary graining need is a large supply of training aircraft. The Cabinet approved in April the ordering of 12,000 aircraft for delivery within: two years, and I have explained the steps which have been taken to expand and employ the production capacity necessary to secure such deliveries within the two years specified. They have involved the basing of production on a much wider, range of firms than hitherto, including leading engineering and shipbuilding concerns and the workshops of the railways. They have also involved the orgariisa-. tion of a large measure of sub-contracting of the components of aircraft to firms which have the machinery and the labour available. It is only by thus carrying the work to the firms which have the labour that the triple increase that is required in the total labour force engaged on airframe production can be achieved. I now propose to develop a system of regional grouping of productive units with emphasis on satellite sub-contracting and concentration on the production of a limited number of our latest and most promising aircraft types.62. An important object underlying the proposals submitted in this paper is that we should be enabled to achieve equality with Germany at least in pro-ductive capacity. Unless our facilities are comparable, the flow of production from British industry at any given time cannot be adjusted to our defence fequire-ments. The capacity resulting from these proposals when it is fully effective in the spring of 1940 will, I believe, give us a productive equipment and a trained labour force not markedly inferior to that of Germany, so far as we can at, present foresee, although it should be borne in mind that production here in war will always be more exposed to interruptions by enemy action. To enable that capacity to be organised and developed to its full extent, and to train the labour force of which, in large part, productive capacity consists, it is necessary to work: to a programme on a large scale for the production of aircraft in the. years 1941 and 1942. I am seeking the approval of the Cabinet to place, in the near future, orders for a proportion of this programme and to instruct the industry, thus expanded and organised, to plan and incur preliminary expenditure on the basis of the full programme. .63. As the capacity now created comes into full.production, the most urgent;: need will be the provision of trained crews for the reserves of aircraft that will be forthcoming. I have briefly indicated the steps which I propose to take, in accordance with the views of my advisers, to accelerate the programme of training of the R.A.F. Volunteer Reserve and simultaneously to increase the facilities for the training of regular aircraft crews.64. By proceeding on these lines, we shall, I believe, be able greatly, to strengthen our Fighter defence by the middle of next year and thereafter to build it up into an exceedingly strong protective organisation. Without emulating in numbers the first-line strength of the German bomber force,, we shall steadily, and progressively increase our counter-striking force both in capacity and Staying power. At the same time, we shall increase our overseas strength, while our reconnaissance and ancillary squadrons will be improved&apos;in efficiency and endurance.65. Measured in terms of first-line numbers, bombing capacity or other yard-, sticks, it would be difficult to maintain that the steps proposed will give full &apos;&apos; parity.&quot; with Germany in the near future so long as she continues her unlimited effort. But it wOuld, I think, be reasonable to claim that we should within a.reasonable period, so far as the Royal Air Force is concerned, be adequately equipped to fulfil the objectives stated by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on...the, 7th March, 1938, viz.:- ,- flMnl.,  (1) Protection of this country. .;;?.!    /?;;.;(2) Preservation of the trade routes. - &apos; .(3) Defence of British territories overseas.(4) Co-operation in the defence of the territories of our allies in, case-    \. of war. /  *  .     r..- i ,       ,K.

APPENDIX.(Secret.) &apos; &apos;       &apos; ; &apos;      ,  .      - -Note on.the Potentiality of the German Aircraft Industry in relation to german Air Force Expansion.(The views expressed in this Appendix on industrial matters have the concurrence of the Industrial Intelligence Centre by whom past papers on the industry have been compiled in collaboration with the Air Staff (Intelligence).)IN the last, conjoint assessment of the German aircraft industry (OLD. No. 1472 B) it was concluded that the output at the beginning of July 1938 was at the rate of 595 airframes per month, of which about 550 were of military types, including training aircraft. Since that date there have been insufficient reports of a quantitative or qualitative character to justify any further detailed assessment. At the request of the Air Staff, however, the Industrial Intelligence Centre has prepared an interim statement (I.C.F. 148 dated the 13th October, 1938), from which the following extracts are taken : &quot; Even had no extraordinary measures been taken to speed up output in preparation for and during the recent crisis, this would have attained a rate of about 600 aircraft of military types (including trainers) per month; ... The special measures taken may well have increased the rate of output by the 1st October to 750 aircraft of military types (including trainers) per month, and if it continues working at this pressure for two or three months, the German industry might realise by about January next a rate of output of at least 950 aircraft of military types.&quot;. f. 1 *A&quot;. TP &apos; &apos;     &apos;        ,-&apos; TP &quot;7V&quot; &quot;7V&quot;&quot; It is estimated that the theoretic plant capacity of the existing German air industry,. . . . working under mobilisation conditions on a 24-hour day, is about 1,500 aircraft of military types per month. But it is believed that the shortage of labour would not at present allow.this maximum.output to be attained. It is doubted if, taking all things into consideration, the present actual maximum rate of output with the plant and labour available, would be more than 1,100 per month, and a number of months would have &apos; to go by before this was reached.&quot;2. In the same report the Industrial Intelligence Centre point out, and the Air Staff desire to emphasise, that, whereas output may have increased, as estimated, to a rate of 750 aircraft per month as a temporary measure at the date of the crisis, there is, as yet, by no means sufficient evidence available to allow us to assume that this rate of. output was, in fact, attained, or is being continued, now that the crisis is resolved. Similarly, it is pointed out that the maximum output of 1,100 per month is, in our joint opinion, a rate only attainable at present under conditions of. national mobilisation.3. In a previous LLC. interim paper on the output capacities of the aircraft industries of certain countries in 1941 (I.OF. 439 dated the 11th October, 1938), the following statements occur in relation to Germany : &quot;If production expands at the rate at which it has been expanding in the last six months the output of aircraft by April 1941 will be about 1,160 per month on the basis of a 44-hour working week. If, however, expansion only continues at the-average rate of the last two or three years, output in 1941 (on the basis of a 44-hour working week) would be about 1,050 per month.&quot;* * * * * *&quot; Germany&apos;s principal difficulty is, and for some time will be, to find sufficient skilled and semi-skilled labour not only to man new factories, but to work existing plant to its full capacity on a 24-hour working day. . . . .
Nevertheless, arrangements for training additional labour are improving rapidly, and there is no doubt that by 1941 considerable labour cadres will be available, though even then thev will probably consitute the principal limiting factor.&quot;        &quot; &quot; i--4. The paper concludes with the statement that by 1941 the German output at normal peace-time working hours may be over 1,000 aircraft per rrionth, and that within three months of mobilisation it may be raised to 2,000 or 2,5001 per month. .  -5. Although it may be felt that the accepted and projected output figures err on the high side, it must be regarded as probable that an increase of 40 per cent, in output will be achieved by 1941, and that these figures could be achieved early next year, under conditions of national mobilisation.6. The view of the Air Staff is that the determining factor in the size of the German Air Force is not the capacity of the aircraft industry, but the training capacity within the organisation of the air force itself to produce aircraft crews and experienced unit commanders and staff officers. Unfortunately, it has not been found possible to assess with any certainty the rate of output of aircraft necessary to maintain and re-equip the German Air Force at various stages during its expected expansion towards a first-line strength of 5,000 aircraft which the Air Staff believe can be achieved by the end of 1940. The steadily ascending rate of output in the past two years has sufficed in that time not only to double the first-line strength, from 1,500 to 3,000, but also in the same time almost completely to re-equip the whole air force with modern aircraft and to lay up reserves which may amount to 75 per cent, in modern types. Such a general re-equipment is not anticipated in the next two years, and it appears quite certainly within the capacity of the aircraft industry to provide an output sufficient to meet-the requirements; of the anticipated expansion and partial re-equipment. If the industry is likely to fail in meeting the German Air Staff requirements, it will not be in regard to expansion and re-equipment of the air force, in peace, but in its ability to provide sufficient skilled labour to meet the requirements of war wastage when the air force has been expanded (as may well be the case) by a further 40 per cent, at the end of 1940.
