ENCLOSURE.770.copy NO.0COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.THE CZECHOSLOVAK CRISIS(Previous Paper No. CO. a   769) report.1P      We have heen instructed, &quot;by the Minister for Go-ordination of Defence, as a matter of urgency, to consider what action, both offensive and defensive, could and should be taken immediately in the event of Great-Britain breaking with   Germany in the course of the next few days.2-,     We have assumed that Italy ranges herself on Germany--s side from the start and that we shall not engage in hostilities before France has done so.3.     We wish to emphasise at the outset of this report that if we are to assume that we will be engaged in imminent hostilities against Germany, we are most strongly of the opinion that immediate general mobilisation is a first, and vitally essential, measurec4.     As regards1 the Navy, it must be realised that nearly t, the whole of the Reserve Fleet is at 14 days&apos; notice, and the fleet as a whole cannot be ready to carry out all the duties required of it until the Reserve Fleet has been
fully manned, and is complete with fuel, stores and ammunition.      In general, 14 days are required for this measure, hut even subsequent to this ships should he given time to shalce down and work up their efficiency before undertaking operations of importance.      In particular, our measures against enemy submarines are dependent on the commissioning of the Reserve Fleet destroyers.5. As far as the Army is concerned, any measures ofreinforcment carried out without mobilisation will prejudice the mobilisation of the Regular Army later.6. The mobilisation arrangements of the Air Force are based on a period of 14 days.     Although we have taken certain steps to reduce this period, and units could operate in a shorter time, they would only do so at a much reduced capacity.7. If the Government are prepared to take the risk .of deferring   the order to mobilise on the grounds that it might precipitate attack on this country, then the order for general mobilisation must be postponed for 48 hours after the decision has been taken to prepare for war.8. This period of 48 hours is essential to enable usto take certain vital defensive precautions, with special reference to our air defences.     In this period 100% of the emergency deployment scheme for the A/A artillery and searchlights would be effected, and without general mobilisation which includes the embodiment of tike Territorial Army as a whole.      In 12 hours not more than approximately 75Jo deployment could be effected, and in about the same time the fighter squadrons could operate at full peace establishment.
5?9. But we emphasise that as far as the Navy isconcerned, nothing short of full mobilisation of the fleet will really enable us to get ahead with our preparations.10.       Irrespective of mobilisation, however, various naval measures would be taken, e.g., to shorten the notice at which ships are at present, and to make certain additional fleet dispositions, if these measures had not been previously authorised.      The arrangements for the air reconnaissance of the North Sea would similarly be expedited during this period by the dispatch of coastal command squadrons to their war stations.11.       We show at Annex A a number of security and other measures which do not entail mobilisation but which we think it only prudent to ask for authority to put into force at once.     Apart from the immediate measures at home, the hostility of Italy and the attitude of Japan renders precautionary measures in the Middle and Far -East essential.12.       Furthermore we ask if we are correct in assuming that the field force will not initially be dispatched to France and that we should base our plans on this assumption.     We point out that if the field force is dispatched it would have to be accompanied by army co-operation and fighter squadrons unless the French are prepared to meet these requirements.      If any of our squadrons are set aside for this purpose, they will not be available for the defence of this country.
13.       In accordance with our terms of reference we have been directed to consider whether, consistently with the effective conduct of the war in the initial stages, it would be in our interests to refrain from initiating any particular form of offensive measures. We consider it essential to refrain from provocative action, such as bombing Germany, at least until we are definitely ready both to defend ourselves and to strike effectively.14.       To attempt to take offensive action against Germany until we have had time to bring our naval, military and air forces and also our passive defence services on to a war footing, would be to place ourselves in the position of a man who attacks a &quot;&quot;tiger before he has loaded his gun.(Signed)      C.L.N.
