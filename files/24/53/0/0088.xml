h WtwrX:  i (This Document fs the PropertyHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Covemmet-:-    -..........     . i., ,, ,COMMAND   IN   THE  MEDITERRANEAN., /aI think it desirable, in view of the failure cf the proposal tc oo-crdinate the Naval efforts cf the Allies in -the Mediterranean, tc put before the War Cabi.net tho present situation aThe Cabinet will realise that the Command cf the Mediterranean aud Aegean to-day it Frcucu, a&amp;ci the respond-biiity for holding the enemy in ohese Seas is French, with such Allied forces as are allot tod to them tc assist. Similarly the Italians are responsible in the Adriatic, and the British in all three Seas play a subordinate role with subsidiary responsibility cnly?    The particular responsibility of the British Cemmande r-in -Chief, Malta, Is anti-submarine and escort work, but everything he dees is under the Command cf the French Admiral at Corfu.      The Bc^r-d of the Admiralty there-fere can only bring the present unsatisfactory state of affairs to the notice of the War Cabinet, and has neither the right nor the means of taking any active steps to improve matters, exoept in the manner which we have already done, viz,,, by advocating co-ordination of the Allied effort&apos; and better use cf our Forces in those Seas..It is the opinion cf the Allied Naval Council that the capital ships at the disposal of the Allies in the Mediterranean are amply sufficient tc deal with those cf the enemy, but a redistribution cf Forces has recently become necessary in order tc meet the menace caused by the possibility of Germany commissioning the Battleships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which either have already fallen into their hands &quot; or may so fall in the near future.    At present six Russian Battleships of the Pre-Dreadnought Class from the Black Sea Fleet are in the hands of (fermany, and unless destroyed by the Russians it is probable that the two Russian Dreadnoughts will shortly also be captured.     Tc meet the threat of action of these ex-Russian ships it is necessary to increase the number of Allied Battleships in the Aegean, which .is at present two British Pre -Dreadnoughts, and consequently the Allied Conrmander-in-Chief, Admiral Gauchet, has ordered a reinferce-ment of four French Battleships to Mudros from Corfu, and this has carried vith it a transference of the Command of the heavy forces in the Aegean from a British Admiral to a French Admiral., The Cabinet and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may wish to consider whether this has any political import.To compensate for this reduction in the strength of the French main Fleet based on Corfu, it was proposed by the French and British Naval Authorities that Italy should&quot;send a Squadron of Battleships from Taranto to Corfu to work as a Squadron of the main French Fleet, under the direct orders of the French Co zander-in-Chief.    Such a combined Fleet at Corfu, trained tc work together under one Command, ought to be oertain&quot;of defeatI5gnfclie^Au^t!?iK Fleet^shoiildThe latter attempt tc leave the Adriatic.-This redistribution of Forces was discussed by the Allied Naval Council, and although all the representatives oi the Allied Navies agreed that the proposal was right in principle, Italy declined tc place any of her Battleships under French orders.    It will be noted particularly that Admiral di Revel - &quot;Agreed in principle with what had been 11 Proposed and thought it might be a useful and prudent &quot;measure to remove some Italian Battleships from Taranto to &quot;Corfu&quot;.   Also it was minuted that the Members representing
Italy, Pconsidered that in -principle, and apart from the ^question of maintenance of supplies, the transfer tc Corfu 1&apos;cf Italian Dreadnoughts would be desirable,,11   The subsequent discussicns at Abbeville and Paris at the Meetings of the Supreme War Council I will not recapitulate, but &apos;the fact remains to-day- that the French Force at Corfu is weaker than we have all agreed in principle it should be, and that even with the reinforcements sent tc the Aegean it is conceivable that in the future the ships there may &quot;be out-classed by the ships which the enemy can bring against them, and, it will be noted, quite unnecessarily outclassed because there is ample Force belonging to the Allies in the Mediterranean to do what is necessary,, and it -would he sheer waste tc send more Battle-; ships there if the Allies are to retain in commission and fuel the existing ForcesfcThe situation consequently as it is to-day is unsatisfactory, and the Admiralty cannot regard it otherwise than with misgivings    As will have been noticed from the proceedings cf the Supreme War Council which tcck place on the first-days of this month at Versailles, Admiral di Revel puts forward the contention that Battleships must be kept at their bases safe from submarine attack, and as far as possible also from aerial raids, only actually being required to engage the enemy&apos;s Battleships.    This theory, if carried out, r and it is being carried cut - must logically result in the Italian Fleet putting to sea tc meet the enemy in an untrained and consequently inefficient state, and the valour of the Italian personnel combined with the excellent material cf th6ir ships cannot make.up for the lack of training that is entailed by a Fleet remaining continually in harbour0      For effective co-op e rat ion my Naval Advisors are unanimous that combined train-ing is absolutely essential, and the testimony of Admiral Sims from his own experience with American Battleships joined with the Grand Fleet is cf great importance.     It is thus recorded in the minufes of the Allied &quot;Naval Council,,    His opinion was ftthai &quot;when the five United States Battleships joined the Grand Fleet &quot;they were net a real addition of strength, but possibly even &quot;the reverseQ    They have now beiaorap a source of strength,51 In Admiral 33mkx opinion at least six months training is required, and in that case no large difficulty existed; Admiral De Bon, in whose - opinion we have great confidences entirely concurs with Admiral Sims.,As long as the whole French Fleet was at Corfu its excess of strength over the Austrian Fleet was sufficiently great to enable it to act without the efficient co-operation of the Italian Fleet, but now that it has become necessary to detach a French Battle Squadron to the Aegean, the efficient cc-operation of at least one Italian Battle Squadron is under the circumstances essential, and this efficient co-operation cannot be obtained without combined training under one CommandIt is certain that the only way in which unity of action cf the Allied Fleets in the Mediterranean, Aegean and Adriatic, and the most economical and efficient use of those Forces can be obtained, is by uniting them under the strategic Command cv one Admiralissimo, and the Admiralty therefore suggest to the War Cabinet the advisability of making further efforts to obtain the adhesion of the Italian Government to the resolution agreed tc in principle by the Supreme War Council on the 1st&quot;June, but subsequently cancelled wring to its emasculation by the abjections put forward by Admiral di Revel.(Signed)       ERIC GEDDES,8th June, 1918.
