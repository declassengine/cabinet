tirC . &apos;.   46KBPKRSKUTAT10H OP THE PEOPLE ACT, 1918,.... mvm***w*,*,****H,****....... wMim MinmnwMwx ih-tMwww........nmum80LDIBRS1 AND BAILORS&apos; YOTS.In accordance with the deoioion of the War Cabinet at their meeting of May iHh I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a Memorandum on the electoral position of Soldiers and Sailors under the Representation of the People Act,&quot;ERNMENT BOARD,  j HA3Q2S31st May, 1918.HAVAL AND  tLXTAIC/2. ffiH&amp;I&apos;The Act confers a new and exceptional parliamentary franchise upon naval &amp;nd military voters, including in the t^rm not only men in the forces but other persons engaged abroad or afloat in connection with the war.   This class of voter is entitled to be registered for any constituency for which he or she would have had the necessary qualification but -for his or her service.   The vot$ is not given to every soldior and sailor as such, but virtually every man over 10 serving who has a residenoe In the United Kingdom can be an elector.In order to secure the registration of     large a proportion as possible of these voters the following arrange-ments have &quot;been made.   The officials engaged in the local collection of information respecting electors are instructed to obtain all particulars that they can of naval and military voters who would have been qualified in respect of residence etc. in their areas, end provision has been made in the form to be filled up by houoeholders for giving similar particulars.   But it is realised that auoh parti cu*-lars will not always he available or may be incomplete or inaccurate, and arrangements have been made for supplementing them as far as possible by particulars to be supplied by the naval and military voters themselves.   ?or this purpose after consultation with the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, Red Cross Society and other bodies, large numbers of cards have been prepared for distribution to the naval and military voters in which each voter can enter particulars of his rank, number etc. and of the address at home in reopeot of which he claims to be entitled to vote.   It wan recognised that it wan not possible to obtain information from men in distant parts of the world and from prisoners of war in time for use in connexion with the first Register, but the Admiralty and the Record Offices undertook to&quot;supply such information as they could with regard to these men.   All these arrangements were
made by the middle of Maroh and soon after that date the cards were distributed by the Naval and Air Force Authorities and by various organisations (Red Cross, Y.M.C.A. etc).   But events in France caused a postponement of the issue of Army inatruo-tions and cards, and it is only within the laot few days that the issue has been made,   Some time must elapse before the cardo can reach individual units, hospitals, stations, Camps, etc; they have then to be filled up by the soldier and returned through the post and find their way first to the Registration Officer, and thence to the local official engaged in the preparation of the lists.   The 15th of June was the date originally fixed for the publication of the lists of voters, but as soon as it was found that the Army Cards had not been issued it became clear that if these cards were to be of any material servioe in the preparation of the lists this date would have to be postponed.   The postponement of a fort-night which has now been authorised will give time for a large number of cards to be received, and arrangements are in con-tempiation for utilising the particulars contained in cards whioh are received too late for incorporation in the lists ae published.   It is not anticipated that there will be any disposition on,the part of any party organisation to question the inclusion of naval and military voters in the lists.II.   VOTING BY NAVAL AND MILITARY VOTERS.The question of the best means for enabling soldiers and sailors to record their votes has been considered and debated on various occasions during the progress of the war.   Voting by post, voting by proxy   ballot boxes in the trenches, have all been considered.   The Speaker&apos;a Conference, which was in the main occupied with devising a post-war system cf franchise and registration, did not go specially -into the question of the voting of soldiers and sailors In war time.   It merely recommended that provision should be made enabling absent voters to vote by post.   The Representation of the People Bill as introduced, following that recommendation, provided that each absent voter - including soldiers and sailors - should have a ballot paper sent to him in which he could record his vote.   V/hen the Bill came to be debated a fairly general feeling was manifested in favour of direct as opposed to proxy voting, but it was clear that if sufficient time was to be given to enable ballot papers to be sent out to men serving in the distant theatres of war and returned, the result of the election would have to be postponod for a very long period, to the great detriment of the nation&apos;s affairs. It was consequently decided that the counting of tho votes might be postponed for, not more than 0 days after the close of the poll, in order that absent voters who were within a moderate distance of this Country might record their votes by post, and that those who were too far distant thus to vote might appoint proxies to vote for them.   An Order in Council has to be issued deciding to what areas on land proxy voting is to be applicable.   All voters afloat are entitled to vote by proxy.   The determination of the areas on land must be large-ly a matter for the Postmaster General.   It has been generally assumed that voting by post will be possible in the oase of absent voters who are in the United Kingdom or on the French or Belgian fronts and that in the case of absent voters elee-where voting will be by proxy.Voting by post.   To make satisfactory arrangements for soldiers and sailors themselves to record their votes in
time of war is a matter of extreme difficulty, and it is recognized that no arrangement con &quot;be complete.   It involves sending the ballot paper to the man and his returning it. The ballot paper cannot be printed till the nomination has taken plaoe, and it must be properly addressed to the man. But in these days the fluidity of the Army and the Navy is so great that men are being constantly shifted from unit to unit, from ship to ship, from place to place, from the front to the base, to hospital and elsewhere.   Consequently the address given on registration will in a number of cases not be the address at the time of an election.   The far Office and the Admiralty have devised arrangements whereby iuaaediateiy on election is announced intimation will be given by Record Offices and Ships to the Registration Officers which will enable their records of addressee to be brought up to date.   Even so it ie too much to hope that this arrangement will be altogether successful as the Record Offices information itself percolates from a variety of sources and can never be really up to date.   No other better scheme has, however, been devised, and it is to be hoped that a very large number of ballot papers will reach the persons for whom they are intended and will be returned within the specified time.Proxy Voting.- It is intended that as soon as it is clear that a naval or military voter will be registered as an elector in respect of any constituency, the Registration Officer shall - without waiting for the completion of the Register - notify tho voter that he will be so registered and also inform him that if he is serving in a &quot;proxy area&quot; he is entitled to appoint a proxy and how to do so.   Proxy voters will of course not have any ballot papers sent to them.   At the time of an election the proxy will vote at the polling booth in place of the voter.The Canadian plan,.   The question of adopting the Canadian system wae considered but it was felt that it wob not possible to apply It to an enormous and widely scattered force such as cur Navy and Army in war time.   The Canadian plan was to postpone the final counting of the votes in Canada until local ballots had been held amongst the Canadian units here and in Prance and the results had been ascertained.   Polling booths were fitted up for the purpose; the soldier had to fill up on an envelope a form of affidavit as to rank, name, number &amp;c, and including the last place of residence in Canada.   This place of residence appears to have determined the electoral district for which the vote was cast.   If a man had never resided in Canada at all, he was entitled to select the electoral district for which he would vote.   A list of the candidates nominated for the several electoral districts was available in the polling booth and the voter could either vote by name for a candidate standing for the electoral division to which he was by residence or selection attached, or he could vote for a party.   The voting paper on which his vote was recorded was enclosed inside the envelope on which he had recorded the prescribed particulars mentioned above.When the polls were closed all the ballot papers, &amp;c. were taken to two centres, one in France and one in England.   They were sorted according to electoral districts and then counted and the resulting figures cabled to Canada. It is understood that allegations have been made of some Irregularities in the procedure.   Of the votes cast in this country about 5 per cent were rejected and some 15 per cent
besides were questioned and judgment upon them reserved. Similar figures regarding the votes in Franco have nrt been supplied.The reasons which seem to have determined Parliament not to adopt a similar system for the United Kingdom were -(1)   The vastly larger size of our forces, and their disposal in a number of Countries, stations, camps, hospitals &amp;c,(2)   The number of separate constituencies and the difficulty of determining the constituency in respect of which each individual would be entitled to vote.(5) The cost and difficulty of arranging for polls in piace9 convenient to all the units and of providing persons sufficiently versed in the matter to conduct the polls.(4)   The very long time which would have to elapse before the results of the election could be determined, and it could be seen what Government was to govern the Country.
