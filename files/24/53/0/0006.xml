BATTLE SITUATION - NOON - 31st MAY 1918.

1. The enemy has reached the MARNE at JAULGONNE and MONT-ST-PERE. Fighting continues with the greatest intensity throughout the whole Battle Front, especially north and south of SOISSONS and north-east of CHATEAU-THIERRY. Fighting continues on the outskirts of RHEIMS where the enemy claims to have captured LA-NEUVILLETTE and BETHENY.

The greater part of the IXth British Corps has either been withdrawn, or is in process of withdrawal from the Battle Front.

It is expected that the enemy will make strenuous efforts to capture RHEIMS to-day.

Our line appears to run approximately as follows :-

Northern outskirts of RHEIMS, THILLOIS - VRIGNY - SARCY - VILLE-EN-TARDENNOIS - ROMIGNY - ANTHENAY - PASSY - GRIGNY - JAULGONNE - MONT-ST-PERE (the last 2 places inclusive to the Germans) EPIEDS - COINCY - CUIGNY - HARTENNES-ET-TAUX, thence as described in last night&apos;s Battle Situation.

2.  On the rest of the Front the situation remains unchanged.
