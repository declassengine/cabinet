Colonel W. Dally&apos;Jones.125Political Intelligence Department, CONFIDENTIAL.Foreign Office,June 1st,, 1918.^^J^ Sweden /O04.((i, I  Jf)^^ SWEDEN   AMD   FINLAND.&quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; of the 26th April published an interesting article. It has special significance as the editor of this paper, Otto von Zweigbergk;, is an intimate friend of Mr. Hellner, Minister of Foreign Affairs.oThe article   begins by quoting from the Finnish &quot;Atto TJnderrflttelse&quot;,whose views, stated &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, on the subject Of Swedo-Finnishrelations are accepted by the Seedish Government as representing theFinnish po^nt of view.   &quot;Abo Un&amp;errflttelse&quot; has some doubts about thevalue to Finland of the agreement with Germany, which recalls both com-mercially and politically the Hanseatic domination of the Baltic, andis somewhat perturfeed by the probable extension of German influence tothe Arctic, which will result, in its opinion, if a Finland intimatelyconnected with Germany should acquire the territory between Ladoga andthe White Sea as well as the Kola peninsula.     Yet it is maintained bythis paper that Finland had to join Germany or go under.     In view ofthe Russian peril in the future, political isolation would have givenF6nland no security.     Consequently, for the protection of her EasternFrontier she was bound to turn to Germany who, by diplomatic pressurealone, was in a ppsition to give her the required security.&quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; points out that if this is so, there is not muchomeaning in a statement in &quot;Abo Underrfittelse&quot; in another connection that it is Sweden&apos;s fault (presumably in that she failed to come to the help of Finland) &quot;that the influence of the Northern nations in the political scales has been imperilled and has not become as great as it might, had Finland been at their side&quot;.Sweden, states &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, could not undertake to guarantee the security of the Finnish Eastern Frontier.     GermanyTs commandinga
nosition enables her, in Finland&apos;s opinion, to uphold Finland&apos;aasovereignty without the risk of/war, which Finland wishes at all cost3 to avoid.     Sweden could have only offered a brotherhood-in-arras in a fight &quot;which both had tiled before with very unsatisfactory results&quot;. &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; goes on to point out that Finland made her ohfcice long before she turned to Sweden.     &quot;We were asked to take action so that Germany might be released from a military expedition which she much wanted to be quit of&apos;*iWith regard to the bigger question of the tendenciee of Finland&apos;s foreign policy.     &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; maintains that it is now plain that the Finnish Government has decided that its policy shall be hsedd on a linking-up with the Central Powers.     Finland is bound to Germany for the present, and the important question is to what extent she shall in the future become dependent.    This depends, as has been pointed out by the Finnish teacher, Herr Pipping, on the extent to which her relations with tfte rest of the North can be maintained and developed and this is a matter for Finland to decide.&quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; points out further the absurdity of the argument that Sweden forced Finland into a line of policy which she did not wish to pursue, vyhile at the same time this policy is declared by the Finns to have been neoessary and they express great joy at the presence of those called in to their aid.The article concludes with a warning to Finland that if &amp;he future Swedo-Finnish relations are to be satisfactory, she must cease to   as-c ibe to Swedish &quot;treachery&quot; a state of affairs which she acknowledges to have been brought about by her own choice, and she should renounce connection as soon as   possible with those fanatical Swedes who main-tain that the policy of the Swedish Government has sullied Sweden&apos;sihonour with a stain which can only in part be washed out by the bloodI of her young volunteers.Allusion is made to an article by the pro-German Swedish ProfessorcHallendorf, who criticised the Swedish Hand expedition just because
it had no annexationist aims, and the Finns are assured that it isonly against such people that attacks such as those that hare oven, made,are. justifiable.     Such people, however, &quot;have no right to say thatthey represent Sweden&quot;.It is interesting to note that even those activists who, as &quot;DagensNyheter&quot; rightly jpoints out, do not represent Sweden are showing them-selves restive and critical of the Finnish policy.    **&apos; sandThe notoriously pro-German/activist &quot;Nya Dagligt Allehanda&quot; hascharacterised the Finnish claims in the Kola Peninsula as mogolomaniao.Other papers also strongly pro-Gorman though not activist deeplyresent the tone of the Finnish press.    A prominent provincial Con-servative pro-German paper, &quot;Norrktfpings-Tidningen&quot;, has protestedagainst the insults which, in the Finnish press, &quot;rain down on all anaeverything in Sweden&quot;,     This protest has no special reference to aFinnish Press statement which, according to &quot;Uorrko*ping3-Tidningen&quot;,expressed malicious joy that Sweden cannot^move her capital evenothough she may&apos; feel uneasy wi in a foreign Aland at her door.The Conservative and oro-German &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; strongly pro-tests against the anti-Swedish campaign in the Finnish Press with regardto the motives which induced the Swedish Government to intervene in othe Alands.&quot;Stockholms Daghladet&quot;, independent and pro-German, is seriouslyannoyed for the same reason.     This paper reoro&amp;uces an article from0its correspondent on the Alands, which points out   that the Finns have, in those Islands, teen carrying on a systematic agitation against the Swedes - special allusion is made to the Finnish priest, Hohenthal, who had grossly insuHed Swedish officers - and extracts from a private latter from Finland are given, full of abuse of the Swedes and fulsome praise of the Germans.     &quot;Stockholms Dagbladet&quot; oalls for a public apology for the accusations brought against Swedish soldiers.   &quot;When such accusations appear in an influential Finnish paper one almost be-gins to wonder whether at the present time in Finland a good understand-ing with Sweden is regarded as something to be worked against&quot;.
It is clear that the wilder Finnish territorial aspirations, the evidence inlletters from Swedish correspondents in Finland of the unpopu-larity of the Swedes, and, above all, the tone towards Sweden of the re-leased Finnish Press are bringing about a reaction in Swedish Conservativ circles, whose enthusiasm for the &quot;bourgeois&quot; Finns had already somewhat abated owing to the emergence of the fact that Finland had appealed for help to Germany before she a-proched Sweden.     It is now only extreme pro Germans who venture to criticise the sol icy of non-intervention, and Government organs are in a position to, and do, triumphantly point out that it is dwing to the bitter Conservative attacks on the Government that the Finns imagine that they can say what they like of Wweden and the Swedes.     The position of the Swedish Government has undoubtedly been strengthened by the complete justification of its policy towards Finland,-4&apos;
