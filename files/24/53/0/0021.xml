Immediate;.,MINISTRY Of SHIPPING, St. James&apos;s Park,London   S.W. 1. 3131 Kay, 1918..Dear Colonel Hankey,It      not without Borne hesitation I write this letter relative to a decision made by the War Cabinet on Friday, the 24th instant, about the combing out of colliers from the pits.. The position in Connection with coal, however, has become extremely serious.    We have had to send tonnage, which now amounts to hundreds of thousands of tons, away in ballast and/or suffer excessive detention during the past few weeks, and the position &quot;both in $ranee and Italy in regard to coal is grave, as well as at our ooaliag stations,In my opinion, sufficient evidence has not been pro-duced to show that the nocessary amount of coal can be produced to fill the necessary requirements under the altered circumstances, and I would like you to submit to the. Prime Minister a request that the matter be immediately considered, so that if necessary, action can be taken.   - I have&apos; spoken to the Prime Minister about the matter.Yours sincerely,(sd) J ..P*, Haclay.
