G.T.-4710.d(THIS DOCUMENT, IS THE IttiPERTY OF HIS BRIT AMI G KA.Jl?STYfS GOVERNMENT .)WAR CABINET.DECISION OF NSTHERLAND GOVEKTONT TO DESPATCH A COTvOY TO DUTCH EAST INDIES..  (Note by the Foreign pffioc.)
\\2. This note appears to raise an important question of policy for Hie Majesty&apos;e Government since it is unlikely that the Netherlands Government would go to the expense and trouble of fitting out and despatching the convoy unless they intended by means of it to send to the Dast Indies persons and goods as to whose passage&apos; there might otherwise be difficulties.    It ie true that in 191o the. Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs   gave a definite \assurance that no more goods of enemy origin should be sent to the Netherlands  last Indies as government goods, but he has since endeavoured to maintain that his assurance did not cover goods transported fcy a warship, so that it must be assumed that the Netherlands Government regard themselves as free to send out goods of enemy orirj:&apos;.n on board the converted merchantman sailing in this convoy.     Th3 paragraph in the note as to the production of certificates of origin ought to cover all the goods sent out, but it does not say, and probably does not mean, that the certifi-cates will be shown to His MajestyTs Government.   In short, the despatch of the convoy must be regarded aB a deliberate attempt to break the blockade.3.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore to consider, firstly, what rep&amp;y to return to the note from the Netherlands Minister, and, secondly, how they shall treat the convoy when it sails.4.    An regards the first question,, if the reply to the note contain.3 a definite statement that the ships will be visited and search.3i because they are carrying passengers and goods, it will give the enemy a handle for violent propaganda in Holland, and may Ye regarded by the Netherlands Government ae a threat whi/ch will make them insist all the more on sending the convoy. Mofceov^r, it would commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to an attitude $h.ich v, month hence they might not wish to adopt but could not abandon without loss of prestige.On the other hand acquiescence in the measures of the Netherlands Government would be tantamount to abandoning the position,&apos; always hitherto maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government, that vessels cannot be regarded as exempt from the exercise of the right of visit and search because they are under convoy.        I His Majesty&apos;s Government would - presumably be unwilling at the present stage of the struggle to abandon any well-established belligerent right which serves to maintain their position at sea;   and the right of visit and search of vessels under convoy is one on which Great Britain has insisted so strongly in the past that even the Netherlands Government cannot pretentl ignorance of it.&apos;6.    Taking all the circumstances into account, I would propose, subject to the concurrence of the War Cabinet, to send a short reply, merely thanking M. van Swinderen for the information contained in his note and reminding him that, as the Netherlands I Government must be well aware, Great Britain has never when a belligerent admitted the principle that vessels under convoy are exempt from visit and search;    I would not propose to add any request for assurances as to the origin of the cargo or the bunker coal carried by the convoy, aB this would weaken our case for searching the vessels, should that course ultimately be deemed! expedient, and might become unnecessary, should we be able to obtain the certificates of origin referred to in the penultimate I paragraph of the note.
111407.    As regards the actual treatment of the convoy, the questions of foreign and naval policy involved are so import-ant that I have felt obliged to submit the matter to the War Cabinet for decision.     I would merely observe that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to face the risk of the explosion which will be&apos; produced in Holland if these ships are searched, it could presumably be arranged that the convoy should not meet any British warships ,ren route&quot; while, if they are prepared to face the outburst, a warning can be convoyed to the Netherlands Government at a later date before the middle of June, and also if necessary, be made public, and the&apos; vessels searched In due course08-    I would add that I have been informed by the Trench Ambassador that a similar note from the Netherlands l&amp;gt&amp;iiw in.Paris has been received by the French Government who. desire to know what answer His Majesty1s Government propose to return to Li. Van Swinderen.9.    The Admiralty concur generally in the foregoing, but desire to lay the greatest possible stress upon the fact that nothing should cn any account be done to weaken the mainten-ance of. our right to visit and search vessels -under convoy.
