On the remainder of the Western Front no other movements of Aviation Units have boon established.     In the Flanders Sector the chief point of interest is that in many cases tent hangars have been replaced by sheds of a more permanent type. (i,e, steel or galvanised iron).    Bombing by day has been slight everywhere;   night bombing has been carried out behind our lines.    The enemy has paid special attention to the North Battle Area, where he has persistently bombed dumps and railway communications.    According to reports received German losses since 21st March have been -757 machines destroyed 281      &quot;       driven down out of control Total-TOT      MS&apos; kahO N IJL ANo, of E.A, brought down No. of E,A. driven down out of control No, of Kite Balloons destroyed No. of our machines missing Woight of bombs dropped No. of Squadrons in the Field,...,. ** * t. *.nilH3f tons 3$nemv,, Fore egNo change is reported.

Since February there has been an approximate Increase of 100 machines,    Recent changes in the aerodromes have boen more in the nature of re-grouping than an apv^rcciablc increase, this being probably duo to tho departure of all (?ornan Units from this front,U E3QPQT A H I A Wo Weekly Report has yet been receivedj Enemy Forces.M**i&apos;lhWIWH*ll*&quot;lMiil*&apos; ******* WWW&apos;No changes reported....TOTALS.
