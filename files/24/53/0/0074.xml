[TMs Document is the Properfcy^of Kis Britannic Majesty^ G-ovemmeat,]     j^iyjPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1918.SECRET.G.T.-4774.   (Amended.)THOUGHTS ON GERMAN COLONIES.DAILY rumours are reaching us from neutral countries to the effect that Germany is about to start a new peace offensive. For this the date usually suggested is the period immediately succeeding the next great German blow in the West, which, in its turn, is expected to occur within the next fortnight. If these stories be true, as they well may be, we may have brought into prominence certain territorial problems which have hitherto been little discussed with our European Allies, and not at all with the United States. I refer to the conquests of German and Turkish territory made outside Europe, mainly, though not wholly, by the efforts of the British Empire.Of course, only so-called moderate opinion in Germany need, in this connection, be seriously considered. The claims of the Military Party are so extravagant that they could never form part of a peace offensive, and indeed could never be imposed except upon an opponent already beaten to his knees. But what is it that the Moderate Party are likely to suggest ? It largely depends, I suppose, upon the success or failure of the Western offensive, but, in its main outline, it would be a policy conforming (so far as Germany and Austria are concerned) to the formula of &quot; no annexations and no indemnities,&quot; conceivably qualified by some compromise as regards Alsace-Lorraine, with some slight concession by the Central. Powers to Italy, and perhaps to Poland, and some concessions by Russia and Rou mania to the Central Powers.Translated into terms of territory, this would mean, in the main, that Belgium would be restored by Germany, and the German colonies by England, France, and Japan.The most obvious, but by no means the most important, criticism upon this scheme is that it places on the same level the conquest of German territory by Germany&apos;s enemies, and the conquest by Germany of a friendly neutral whom she was bound to protect. Ethically, there can be no comparison between the two operations, and the two kinds of annexation cannot in equity be made to balance each other when peace comes to be arranged.Quite apart, however, from considerations of abstract justice, there are the strongest practical reasons why Germany should not be permitted to regain any of her colonies in Africa, China, or the Pacific -reasons, the most important of which do not, in my opinion, affect the security of the British Empire much more seriously than the security of her European and American partners in the war.Before the lessons of this war were learnt, I was never an opponent of German colonisation. I negotiated a treaty by which, if for financial reasons Portugal had been forced to part with her African colonies, Germany would have obtained her full share of them ; and certainly before 1914 I saw no sufficient reason to regret this policy. Since then, however, two things have become plain: the first, is that Germany will decline to copy Great Britain and regard tropical colonies merely from the point of view of civilisation and commerce ; the second is, that she would not only have the will, but the power, to use them as a means of world domination.Nothing, 1 think, can be more certain than that, if this war ends in a territorial status quo ante; still more, if it ends in a German peace, Germany would set to work to organise a formidable native force in her restored African colonies. Responsible German statesmen are openly advocating the appropriation by Germany of a central block of territory running from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, where Germany could raise and discipline native forces which would threaten the security of every community from the Cape to the coasts of the Mediterranean. Even if she had to abandon these far-reaching schemes, and only regained her former Central Africa colonies, (which is the hypothesis I am considering), she could make them a constant menace, not merely to the Portuguese (who, unassisted, are perfectly helpless), but to the French, British, Italian, and Belgian possessions in that continent. [488]12
This danger is far from negligible ; but it is insignificant compared with the peril that would follow upon the German acquisition of naval bases in the neighbourhood of all the main trade routes in the world. If the Germany of .1018 or 1919 lias the same ambitions as the Germany of 1914, the experience of the war will have taught her what she did not realise before, namely, the best method of turning these bases to account, A few well equipped ports within striking distance of the Indian Ocean, and the great highways of the Atlantic-and Pacific, used as Germany is now using her ports on the Elbe, in the Baltic, and in Belgium, would paralyse the trade of the world. Such bases are easy to construct, and not, I imagine, very costly to maintain. Deep harbours, great clocks, huge repairing sheds are not required, Establishments on a comparatively humble scale, impregnable from the sea, and beyond hostile attack by land, would suffice for the main purposes of submarine offence ; nor am 1 aware of any answering precautions which it would be in the power of our Admiralty to contrive.The British Empire would no doubt be the most immediate sufferer ; for all its great lines of communication are maritime, and its widely scattered members are bound together by the ocean. But in a smaller measure most of the Allied Powers are in the same case ; and all without exception would be brought to the verge of ruin if Germany could sever at will the arteries along which alone they can carry on mutual trade and give each other mutual assistance. Indeed, we may go further and say that a piratical Power, prepared to use the submarine as Germany has used it in this war, and possessed of well placed bases in every ocean, could hold up the sea-borne commerce of neutral and belligerent alike, no matter what were the naval forces arrayed against it.I conclude then that, if peace and security he the objects of the war, it would be madness to restore any German colony to an unregenerate Germany. But it is not so clear that they should all be finally annexed by those who have conquered them. Japan is, indeed, the heir of Germany in China, and we promised to support her claims to the Pacific Islands north of the Equator, when the subject is brought up at the Peace Conference; while the territories acquired by Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa must not be torn from their new owners. So far we are committed. But whatever we may have to do elsewhere, I do not think we should endeavour to increase the area of our mid-African possessions.The contrary view has, indeed, been defended with great ability by Lord Curzon in a paper prepared for the Cabinet. It is not that he desires, any more than I, to add new territories to the British Empire. He is well aware that nothing was further from the thought of our people when they went to war than so-called &quot;imperialistic &quot; ambitions; and he does not suggest that Avar has stirred in us any new appetite for expansion. But he holds that, if Germany is not to regain her colonies, there is no tolerable alternative except taking them ourselves; and he argues that, whether this be best for us or not, it will certainly be best for the development of these great territories, and for the native populations that inhabit them.Now I deny neither of these two propositions. Indeed, I think them undeniable. If we concentrate our attention on the colonies themselves, Lord Curzon&apos;s conclusions are, as I think, irresistible. But if we consider the whole situation as it may present itself at a peace conference, we may see good reasons for taking a different view.The present situation is something of this sort: France hopes to get Alsace-Lorraine, half Togoland, and more than half the Cameroon s; Italy hopes to get the Trentmo, Trieste, and &quot; rectifications &quot;; Japan hopes to get Germany&apos;s former possessions in China and the Northern Pacific; the smaller States in South-East Europe have each their own scheme of expansion; Turkey expects to recoup herself east of the Black Sea, if she cannot regain the Arab territory from which she has been expelled ; Belgium looks forward to full restitution; Russia has no national policy; and the two Central Empires are frankly out for plunder. Among the greater belligerents there remain only America and England, and on them will certainly fall the heaviest responsibilities in connection with the world settlement which should accompany the re-establishment of peace.This is likely to happen, it seems to me, whatever be the termination of the Avar, hut it is most likely to happen if the termination is indecisive. If it he decisive, the settlement will be determined by the undisputed will of the victor. But in the contrary event then, whether the balance of success be on the Allied or on the German side, there will necessarily be compromises and concessions; and the Powers who, in such circumstances, would be best fitted to guide the course of international diplomacy will be the PoAvers Avho can most easily sustain a continuance of the Avar should peace negotiations break doAvn, and the PoAvers who expect least for themselves out of the
collision of opposing interests. America inevitably stands first in respect of both qualifications. We ought to stand second, and as near her as may be. It seems clear to me that, if we are going to make a struggle to retain German East Africa and part of Togolaud, in addition to the German colonies which we are bound to keep for the sake of our self-governing dominions, we shall seriously weaken our diplomatic position when we set ourselves to the task oi&apos; establishing an Arab State, of defeating attacks on our naval position, and rearranging the map of Europe. I would, therefore, be prepared to give them up, on proper conditions and for adequate consideration, to anybody except the Germans.So used, their diplomatic value may be great. Belgium, France, and Italy are all bitten with the mania for colonial expansion. It may be that we shall not find ourselves able to obtain for Belgium all the compensation to wjiich she is entitled, or for France and Italy all the territorial readjustments which they have a right to expect. Should these things happen, or any of them, our colonial conquests may smooth the path to a general settlement.Again, were the course of events to make it for other reasons desirable, I should not shrink from the hazardous experiment of a &quot; condominium.&quot; I admit, of course, that this is a bad form of government. I admit that where it has been tried it has failed. But it may well have international advantages which outweigh its administrative shortcomings. For it ensures two important advantages. It ensures that the produce of the internationalised territories shall supply markets and raw materials impartially to all the world ; and it ensures that in peace time they shall not be so organised as to become a military or naval menace to their neighbours should war break out. These are advantages which, as I think, may easily outweigh the intrigue, the jobbery, and the petty rivalries to which this form of government so easily lends itself..It may perhaps be thought that, in thus proposing to surrender lands which have been ill-governed by our enemies and fairly conquered by ourselves, I am sacrificing without sufficient reason legitimate British claims. And if the readers of this paper happen also to remember that, in a note I wrote some little time ago on peace arrangements in the Near East, I contemplated the possible surrender of Cyprus also, my credit as guardian of national interests may suffer serious eclipse.Yet it should not be so. It is quite true that (with the possible exception of Bussorah) the peace I contemplate as the result of a more or less successful war gives us no increases of territory north of the Equator. But, in the first place, it must be observed that, though the increases south&apos; of the, Equator are retained rather in the interests of the Dominions than of Great Britain, this is not an argument which will greatly appeal to the Powers assembled in the Peace Conference. That the British Empire has acquired every German possession, whether in Africa or the Pacific south of the Line (excepting the French portions of Togoland and the Cameroons), is the broad fact that will impress them. They will draw no? distinction between Britain and the British Empire ; nor, for my own part, do I think that in this they will be to blame.But there is a second point to be borne in nrind. Even though the establishment of an Arab kingdom in the Plejaz, of an autonomous Arab protected State in Mesopotamia, and of an internationalised Jewish &quot; home &quot; in Palestine will not increase the territories under the British flag, they will certainly give increased protection to British interests, both in -Egypt and in India. They will constitute &quot;buffer States,&quot; of all the greater value to us because they have been created not for our security but for the advantage of their inhabitants.From the various considerations thus set forth, my conclusions are as follows : 1. No conquered colonies should be returned to the Germans which could supply them either with naval bases or a recruiting ground for native levies.2. No conquered colony should be retained by Great Britain for British purposes. Some must be retained in the interests of the Dominions; the others should be surrendered to our Allies, or placed under some form of condominium from which Germany may be, but need not be, excluded.,,These surrenders should be used when the time comes to smooth the course of peace negotiations; andThey should be made on terms which would prevent their commercial misuse in the interests of one particular Power or group of Powers, or their military use by any Power whatsoever.A.
