In April total imports yito the United Kingdom amounted to 3.087,000 tons which is 1$ above the figure for April 1917 and 26$ below that of April 1913.2.    For particular imports the following points may be noted. In April 1918 imports of $rain and flour were-up by&quot; 9$ as compared with April 1917 and imports of meat by no&apos; loss than 46$.   There were also large increases in the importation of timber and of naper making materials.   On the first four months of 1918 ,as compared witjh 1917, wheat and flour were 24$ lower, meat 11% up, timber 24$ up and paper making materials 32$ up. Haw wool was down 28^ and &quot;raw cotton 6$.   For a number of important commodities comparison with the early months of 1917 is impossible because Government-owned goods (except food) were excluded from the returns before July 1917.3.    Total^exports in Anril amounted to 3,230,000 tons, which is onlybelow the-figure for April 1917.   Goal exports amounted to 2,786,000 tons, or 2,7$ more than in April 1917, Most important manufactures show a reduction in t.oimage on April 1917 - iron and steel of 25$, wool of 35,2$, joachinery of 5.6$,   Cotton, however, showed an increase of 2.2$ .   For    \ the four months ending April the tonnage of all manufactures -exported was .down 28.9$ as. compared with 1917 that of coal was down 9,8J6 ;and- the total weight of exports of all kinds was down 12.9%*  As compared with 1913 manufactures were down 64.4$, coal 55;5$, and the total weight.of exports of all kinds 57.2$.4.    While imports in April were down 26$ on 1913, the entrances of British and Foreign vessels (with car^p) were down 47$; and while imports were up 1% on 1917 tonnage entrances were up 4-L    Thus, as agai,nst the leading factor is AOp greater and as af*ainst 1917 &apos;3/0 less,5.    In April, British entrances with cargo (other than requisitioned vessels) amounted to 1,694,000 net tons, that isA.H. STANLEY.
10$ more than inAoril 1917.   In riaroh there had been a percental increase of 11//, on 1917.   The April and March figures are thus both remarkably p;ood, though it must be remembered that that British entrances in these months in 1917 may still have been affected in an abnormal wanner by the beginning of the submarine campaign,!   British clearance (other&quot;thai requisitioned vessels) \uxe 939,000 tons, -ZO/h less than m April 1917, compared v/ith a decrease of 23g *n ^-rc^*   Foreign entrances amounted to 303,000 tons, l$jc less than in April 1917 - as against an increase of 12% in, the previous month - and foreign clearances to 624,000 tons, 3% less&apos; than inAoril 1917.6,    In April total losses of British ships ing, of over 500 G.T. amounted to 233,000 ptoss tons of which 214,000 tons were due to war risk.   ;?ar losses during the preceding three months were at the rate of 204,000 tons&quot;per month.   hSJe April figure thus shows a slight worsening but is still under the forecast of 225,000 tons a month,7.    War losses of the Allies (other than British) in April were 44,000 tons as against 88.000 in uiarch and of neutrals 14,000 tons as against 52,000 in march.   The average of v.rorld war losses to British. Allied and Keutrals combined.) over the first four months of 1918 amounted to just over 300,000 tons a month.3.   *0n March 31st, - the figure for Aoril 30th, is not yet available - as coanared with February 28th, the employment of the British Mercantile steam fleet over 500 tons had changed as follows;-1000 tons at., Change sinceMarch 31,       February.____Vessels repairing and surveying        B23 -33.

It thus appears that during March the total tonnage fit for service increased by 75.000 tons, that there was a drop of 400,000 tons in the tonnage in the service of the ami and &apos; Navy, and that this, despite a substantial addition to tlie, .&apos; tonnage lent to liuropean Allies and a new commitment of 1^0,000 tons to assist tho transport of American troop:?, made possible an increase of 224,000 tons available for the&quot;trade of&quot;tho United Kingdom.9.

It will be noted that owing to the increase in.vessels undergoing repair and in vessels launched but not completed, a reduction of 11/; in tho total on the register has meant a reduction of tonnage fit for service of as much as 15;?,   Owing to the withdrawal of vessels in the service of the Army and Navy, Allies, Colonies and permanent trade abroad,&apos; it has been found possible to keen down &quot;the reduction in the tonnage available for british trade (other than oilers) to roughly 332,000 tons out of a total effective reduction of 2,456,000 tons.   This is only, a reduction of 3$ on the vessels available for United Kingdom trade in iiarch 1917,   Owing, however, to uncertainty in the figure of vessels permanently abroad, on account of the change made in&apos;January.in the method of classification no great stress can be laid:on&apos; the smallncss of this figure,   Further, it must be rememberee. that in Uarch 1917, when our comparison begins the tonnage Of vessels available for United Kingdom trade was already enormously diminished below the figure for normal times,10,   The following table shows the position of British ship-&quot;ouildlng as reported during the week ending 3rd, aay, 1918:

Of the tonnage of &quot;other merchant vessels&quot;, 166.000 tons are ships for carrying- meat and fruit.&apos; The total tonnage under construction is some&quot;49,000 tons more than a month before: and the tonnage of standard shins under construction has increased by 99,000 tens.During the last week of4April 137 merchant vessels of 495,COO tons wore being repaired in dry dock, and 230 of 636,000 tuns in all were being repaired afloat,.   Thus the total tonnage undergoing repair was just over l  million gro3S tons, or nearly tue same as a month ago.   This figure does not correspond with that givon in the Table in 8 8 and g 9 taken from &quot;the Ministry&apos;of  hipping Returns which include only vessels requiring more Serious repair.Sinco curtailment of output was orgamsea by tne Cotton Control Board unemployment funds have been found by neans of a levy on firms which are running more than tne recognisea normal amount of machinery - now 50%.  $ho Treasury agreea uo augment the fund, if necessary^ up;,. tee-June otn,. out ljs^^discharged but merely suspended from&quot;work for one week out of four or more;   but under the new scheme now in contemplation this rota system is to be abolished.  A new scheme isJ&apos;necess-ary to restrict the industry still further.   The one oroposed reduced hours outside the Egyptian section to 40 as the stan-dard, the percentage of machinery to be run under ordinary conditions&quot;being kept at 50.   At&quot; the same time it is intended to impose a levy on all working machinery, and tho effect of this will be to increase the fund.  A wages question is noil? sending in the industry and tho adoption in its entirety of the above scheme is conditional upon the nature of tho wages settlement.   The number of people out of work is about 47,000 of whom about 5,000 aro adult males, 3^,000 adult females,, an 10,000 juveniles.
hi hiA modification of tho volicy aojliod in the CottonIndustry has recently boon adooted In tho Dundee Jute,industry,. An order of December 1917 reauced the jutesupplies of spinners by 10/*.   the reduction could be meteither by spinning finer yarns or by stoooing machinery.by an agreement of February 27tl.u working&apos;hours in the&apos;spinning mills have been reduced from c&apos;o&quot; to 40 per week,is jute&quot;yarn is no-longer exported, e.,ccpt under license,the reduction of hours in weaving is less and variesfrom mill to mill.   As a compensation for reduced reearnings  wages were raised %o,u or 7/- a, week, whicheverwas least,  a joint committee of employers and workpeopleadminister relief in cases of actual discharge.   Tho fundsare found by the enrol overs.   The rates of fared % which haveboon in fore3 since&quot;March 14, aro 25/*- a week for malesand 13/- for females over IS.   They are only given tothose who havo boon unable to find&apos; other employment.   Thissystem should promote that transference of labour whichis desirable in the national interest, while safeguardingthose for whom other work of national utility cannotimmediato-lv bo found.11 ,In the Scottish Flax Industry  the 40 hour week and augmented wage has&apos; recently &quot;been adopted, as in Jute. The Irish industry is still relying on ordinary (uncornpeasated) short-time, but it is doubtful who the r this system can be continued.   In the ^pollen and Worsted Industries  schemes for a system of levies and compensated short-time have been discussed: but tho relatively favoured position of raw wool has made their application hitherto unnecessary.   The industry has recently reverted to the ::5f hour week.   There is appreciable unomploy-ment only in the wool combing&apos; branch owing to the reduced import of combing wool., dibout  400 a woek is now being    Id out by woolcombing employers by way of compensation.21st uiay, 1915.(5)
