BATTLE SITUATION - EVENING - 30th MAY, 1918.

Latest reports indicate that our troops are still fighting on the northern outskirts of RHEIMS. The enemy continues to exert the greatest pressure throughout the whole Battle front, especially at the point of the salient where he is apparently making strenuous efforts to reach the HARNE, between DORMANS and CHATEAU-THIERRY.

A heavy attack developed on our front west of RHEIMS at 12 noon to-day and large numbers of troops were observed on the BOURGOGNE-RHEIMS road.

This morning the enemy extended his attacks westwards as far as NOYON; these attacks were completely repulsed. No details are yet available as to the strength of this new attack.

Our line appears to run approximately as follows :

BETHENY - LA-NEUVILLETTE - CHAMPIGNY - THILLOIS - VRIGNY - MERY-PREMECY  (all inclusive to us), TRAMERY - LARGERY - VEZILLY - GOUSSANCOURT (all inclusive to the Germans), CHAMPVOISY - LE-CHARNEL - COURPOIL - BRECY - COINCY - NANTEUIL-NOTRE-DAME GRAND-ROZOY (all inclusive to us). Thence northwards through PARCY-THIGNY - LECHELLE -, east of CHAUDUN, thence along the west bank of the RIVER CRISE, east of MERCIN-ET-VAUX, east of PASLY, west of CHAVIGNY, West of JUVIGNY, BAGNEUX, west of CRECY-AU-MONT to our original front line about GUNY.

29 German divisions have been identified, and it is estimated that 45 divisions have been used.

3. On the rest of the front the situation is unchanged.
