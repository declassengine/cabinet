 ft ,Politioal Intelligence Department,\ &apos; foreign oracE.Confidential...........................Sweden /002,May 89, 1918.MEMORANDUM ON-   SWEDISH &quot;LAMDSTING&quot; ELECTIONS h FRANCHISE REFORMS.The elections to the County and Town Councils (Landstingen) give the following results:-Losses.        Gains.Conservatives 44 seatsFarmers&apos; Union &amp; Peasants&apos; Agricultural 39 seatsAssociationLiberals 25     &quot;Social-Democrats 17     &quot;Young (Extreme) Socialists 20    &quot;One election has been appealed against.The total number of seats in &quot;the various Town and County Cbun-eils is about 1,600 and as the elected members form the Electoral College of the First Chamber of the Riksdag, an indication is obtain-ed through the Landsting election^ of the probable composition of the First Chamber of the Riksdag next, autumn when five County Councils will elect representatives.The increase in the Social-Democratic vote is due rather to the working of the voting system than to any strongly marked change in the political views of the population.     The number of votes at the -disposal of any individual voter varies from 1 to 40, according to his rateable income, and as the large rise in wages during the War has given a greater proportionate number of votes to the working than to the wealthier classes, most of whom had already 40 votes to their credit, it is quite natural that the Social-Democrats, recruited al-most entirely from the industrial working-classes, should have gained a number of seats.The loss to the Conservatives of 44 seate is, it is claimed by/
thorn, to a considerable extent counterbalanced by the gain to the two Agricultural Parties of 139 seats,    This is probably true though, as both these parties have shown definite proofs of independence, it is by no means certain that tho Conservatives can in all matters reckon on their support.     It is curious that one of these two par-ties, the &quot;PoGDants&apos; Association&quot;, should cling to tho old electoral system (the 40 degrees soale) as it would appear that unless a change in it is brought about, the land population as an electoral force must inevitably be swamped by the town-dwellers, for the land values can never rise proportionately to the wages in the towns,The liberals and Moderate Socialists combined, i.e., the Government Parties, show a loss of 8 seats, - the Extreme Socialists a gain of 20.     In the Worth of Sweden the latter have achieved very considerable success and this they hate principally to thanlr to the vote of the labourers in the saw-mills and the peasant-faamiers of Hforrbotten (N. Bothnia).    The former^ rough and unruly, are of the stuff of.which Extremists are made;   the latter are followers of Lindhagen, tho &quot;Young1&apos; Socialist Mayor of Stockholm, a man of con-siderable influence, who has for years past championed the cause of the peasant-farmers.With regard to the effect of these elections on the constitu-tion of the First Chamber, the Liberal organ &quot;Dagens lyheter&quot; reclcon-ed in April, before the results were definitely laiovm, that they would result in a reduction in the number of Conservative seats from 26 to 22, and it added that the elections for the &quot;landsting&quot; show a slow but sure evolution towards eqiiilibrium of the two parties - &quot;an evolution which does not for a moment disturb the bizarre joy in-spired in the &quot;Right&quot; by the Electoral victories achieved by the Socialists at the cost of the Liberals&quot;.    According to later in-formation, it would seem that the Conservative majority in the First Chamber will at the next elections actually be reduced from 26 to 20 seats.    That the &quot;Right&quot; should, rejoice at the Socialist gains, ac--2- credited
credited principally to tho loung Socialist Party, is perhapa natural. Any results which adversely affect the strength of tho Government block is, they think, to their advantage,    They have indeod on oo-&apos;oasion not disdained to make common cause with the Socialist Ifetrom-ists, - an opportunist policy which plainly in tho long run oan bring thorn no permanent politioal advantage.With regard to the franchise reform Bills introduced by the present Government, it will bo recollected that it was only on the understanding that the Swart a Government v/ould resign if the autumn elections of 1917 went against them that Branting stopped in to res-train the Socialist demonstrators in the spring of last year.    The elections went against the Conservative Government and it resigned but no one doubted that the Conservative Party would put up a des-perate fight against reform measures which, if carried, threaten to rob it of a great part of its political power..... On the 27th of May, the first of these measures embodied in a Bill providing for women&apos;s suffrage&apos;and the eligibility of women to both Chambers of the Riksdag, was thrown out in the First Chamber by 62 votes to 36 after it had been passed by the Second Chamber by 120 votes to 49,The second democratic reform measure which will affect the con-stitution of the First Chamber is now before the Riksdag and the Government Bill on this subject will almost certainly suffer the same fate. Most of the Conservatives, favour, as a milder alternative to the. Government proposals, a rather vagae scheme securing &quot;representa-tion of interests&quot; (economic, agricultural, etc.)., which is, however, like the present system, founded on a plural and plutocratic basis.The moderate Socialists arc determined to bring matters to a head, should the Conservatives persist in rejecting the second Bill as they have done tho first.    On the 1st of May an open-air demon-strati on in Stockholm of 25,000 supporters of Branting passed a re-solution which, after advocating a peace founded on self-determin-ation and international right and energetic measures for an increase * /in
in the food-supplies and. their equitable distribution, expressed the expectation of the Meeting that &quot;if the &quot;Right1 insists on opposing the eaual communal vote as it has done in tho case of women&apos;s suf-pfrago, the democratically-minded majority in the Riksdag and their-Government shall not shrink from any possible legal means of pressure which may be regardod as calculated to carry through these democratic reforms&quot;,On the same day, Mr. Thorsson, Socialist Minister of Finance, insisted that the opposition (to reform) must be broken.     &quot;We shall get our rights and within legal limits.    There are ways in the Riks-dag to oomphl tho ,RIghtI to give way and in addition the working-classes have the right to demonstrate, which can be thrown with full force into the scale&quot;.As regards the first moans of compulsion, as it is only on fi-nancial questions that the two Chambers vote together and in this common vote the Government Parties have a majority of two, it would appear that some form of tax on capital is being considered.     It must, however, be taken into account that two is a very narrow majority in the two Chambers voting together and that the Liberal enthusiasm for electoral reform is not so strong as it was last year. It would seem from information received that events In Russia have exercised a damping effect on the reformers,As regards the second, it is to be noted that, according to statements made by Mr. Branting, the moderate Socialists are ar-ranging to organise doomnstrations on a large seals in the event&apos; of the &quot;Right&quot; maintaining their intransigeant attitude.
