the Property cColonel I, My Jones.129CIRCULATEDED TO THE&apos; -KING AND WAR CABINET.I circulate this memorandum tor the consideration of the Northern Neutrals Committee;1.   The Netherlands Government have publicly announc-ed their intention to. send certain Dutch merchant, vessels under convoy to the Dutch Indies.   A copy of the announce-ment as telegraphed by His Hajesty&apos;s Minister at The-Hague is annexed.. The convoying ships will consist of a regular man-of-war and a Rotterdam liner converted for this purpose into an auxiliary cruiser,,   A collier is to accompany the convoy.2.   In &quot;their public- declaration the Netherlands Government say they will not permit any ships so convoyed to be subjected to visit and search by a belligerent. They announce however their intention to submit to the belli-gcront information and documents concerning the cargoes to be carried,, and add that no mails will be taken*. &apos;5%,   These assurances purport to apply only to the con-voyed vessels under the merchant flag.    It is however to be remembered that the Butch Government have claimed the right to send, both mails and &quot;government goods&quot; by men-ef war, aud although we have contested their right to do so, they maintain their position.(--Signed)&apos; Robert Cecil..
4.    The- .claim-r1i]i8rt^^ vessels., arenot exempt-from search when under convoy of their own , national flag, is one which in former days this country has vindicated single-handed against all other nations; though in recent years Germany has supported the British doctrine,.    Vie have therefore to face the fact that out present allies are &quot;by their former attitude--.coimd1yted^&apos;-ta^ at least the theoretical recognition of the Dutch claims as in accordance with international law,5,    At the naval conference in 1.909-10 both &quot;&quot;&quot;tiie-.BritislT and German Governments expressed their readi-ness to adopt the view of the other Powers, with certain safeguards,    This was avowedly offered as a concession designed to promote a general agreement between the Great Powers as to the rules of naval warfare,.    Under the arrangement then proposed, whilst it remained &quot;open to&quot;.the belligerent naval commander to challenge the innocence of a particular convoyed cargo of which he was to he given all such particulars as might otherwise &quot;be ascertained by the right of visit and search as &apos; then exercised,the examination of the cargo was to have been left absolutely to the commander of the neutral convoy and it was only it the latter was satisfied that the cargo was not in fact innocent that lie was bound to withdraw ills protection-from ..the incriminated vessel.
&apos;6,    The general&apos;-agreement&apos;thus outlined was no-o, however, reached, and the concession offered by Great Britain and Germany did.not therefore he come a fact/That in tnese circumstances the British Government up-&apos;......    ...    . . .hold their traditional policy on the subject of convoys must he well known to;the Dutch Government.    Their declaration consequently is an act of defiance,    It -proclaims quite frankly the intention of breaking the blockade.    For it is clear that the blockade will become impossible if neutrals are allowed, to convoy their merchantmen with&apos;entire immunity from search./    A most important principle of naval warfare is at stake.7.    Whilst His Majesty5s Government cannot allow.&apos;, any doubt to prevail as to the rights which they claim in respect to neutral convoys, political considerations may&apos; arise which may make the practical assertion of those rights inexpedient at a particular&apos; moment. - If the exercise of our right were expected to lead to Holland&apos;s declaring war on us, clearly the present political- and military, as well as the general naval situation of -the allies would have to be taken into account before deciding on action having such consequences,8,    There is however nothing- whatever to snow that Holland contemplates any abandonment of her neutrality,&apos;   &apos; On/
On tiie contrary every tiling points&apos; to lie r determination to remain neutral at almost any cost.    It is more reasonable to suppose that the Butch, encouraged by the numerous instances in which His Majesty1s Government have, during the present war, either made concessions or waived the exercise of rights rather than provoke a quarrel., have persuaded themselves that in this matter of the convoys also they would be allowed in the end to have their way.    This . would mean that their attitude is one of bluffing,9.    Holland has much to. gain if she can have her way.    It is perhaps a minor matter that the Dutch would be able to export German or other enemy goods to the Par East;   that German agents and&apos; propaganda and secret correspondence could be safely carried;   that the setting up of large power wireless stations could be arranged with German assistance.    The more serious danger would lie in the transactions covered by the in-coming convoys.    ?or we must assume that the present will, not remain an isolated venture.    If it succeeds, it will be followed up,    And other neutrals will learn the lesson.    There will be streams of neutral convoys running the blockade.10 y
.10.   It accordingly seams essential to uphold the validity of the British doctrine in sucn a way as to frustrate all such attempts In the future.11,  The Dutch may count upon creating -special difficulties &quot;for us by making the first venture as Innocuous as possible.   It is more than likely that if the convoyed merchant vessel were brought -in, she would be found to carry none but innocent cargo; and the Dutch would then make the most of this fact.,especially if they had previously offered guarantees as to such innocence,12*   To interfere with the converted cruiser,even if she carries merchandize or civilian passengers, would on the other hand,present-practical difficulties not easily surmountable.&apos; It has therefore been suggested that.perhaps the least troublesome method of asserting our right of search might be to seize the collier, if, as Is likely to be the case,&apos; she carries German coal. We should have strong presumptive evidence justifying proceedings In.the Prise Court, and condemnation would almost certainly follow.   Moreover if the capture were&apos; so arranged as;to take place at a sufficient distance from home waters, so that by that time the bunkers of .. the convoy were near exhaustion, we should, ^preventing
** (3 **replenishment from the collier,. compel the Dutch, whatever their indignation, to appeal to the allies for coal and to come into our ports,13..    Enquiries are being made through His Majesty&apos;s Legation at The Hague to make sure whether the coal loaded on the collier will in fact he of enemy origin. Of course if it is not, if the Dutch have the iar-eDight, and the raeajhs. to supply themselves for the voyage with British coal,   the capture of the collier will not offer the desired solution.    Vie should then, presumably, have to seize the convoyed merchant ship and bring her in for examination.    If found innocent, she would  be allowed to proceed;    but our right would be vindicated,14,   If it may be correctly assumed that the Dutch do not mean to create a casus belli, it will be prudent to make it as easy as possible for them to accept the situation.     From this point of view it is of course regrettable that our answer to Mr, Van Swinderen&apos;s communication has he en delayed until the Dutch Government have committed themselves to a public declaration of their intentions.   It would be well now to address to them an unambiguous statement that we cannot possibly agree at this time to abandon a right which this country has consistently upheld and enforced and which having regardto/
to the intensive character of modern naval warfare had grown in importance,,15,   If, for political reasons, it were desired to go as far as we can to save Dutch susceptibilities, it might perhaps be feasible, whilst insisting on the full maintenance of our right of search, to offer an arrangement by which we undertook not to search these particular vessels on this particular journey (outwards) in return for specific guarantees to the following effect via:-A. Full particulars of the cargo and passengers on board any merchant ship sailing in the convoy to be furnished to us in the same way as is now Hone by the Netherlands Oversea Trust in respect of ships under their   control,    the ships not being allowed to sail until our-authorities have been satisfied that all is in order. -B, The..vessels, under the Dutch naval flag (includ-lng the converted auxiliary cruiser) not to carry any merchandise or passengers (other than Dutch Government officials);   the tens merchandize&quot;, however not to include stores certified to be for the exclusive use of the Dutch colonial authorities, provided always that such stores contain nothing wholly or partly ot enemy origin5 - this in accordance with tho official undertakingcontained/

Should it be decided, for political reasonsto offer the above compromise to the Netherlands Government, it is unlikely that any important allied interests would suffer provided it be fully understood that no precedent is created.   If^the Netherlands Government demand further j assurances respecting the return voyage, the matter would I have to be gone into more fully, The difficulties attending I the return voyage would probably be lens easy to meet,-IT.

t6 a definite intimation on our part that we shall insist on exercising our right of visit and search and that the responsibility for antf troubles arising in consequence must rest with the Netherlands Government.   In that case it is essential-that when the Dutch convoy is met it should find itself face to face with such superior force as will preclude armed resistance on its part.(Signed) E,A,Crowe.iPOEEIGN OFFICE,S.WY1..June 3rd,1918,
[This Document is the Property o! His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use.] 138(97101),1VIILI&apos;1ARY TRADE i^DT&amp;EAIi&quot;Telegram (en clair) from 3Ir W. Townley. (The Hague),D. May ?lstul913. II. /oy ^lst.1918.No. 1973.Following official communique published this morning begins;-With reference to articles in Press showing incorrect views regarding convoy to be despatched about middle of June i&amp;p&amp;rtmeno ol hi&amp;r xne coe^uunioaoes i on owing;February 16th, warship &quot;Hertog Hendrijc&quot; left for East Indies to relieve material and personnel of Netherland squadron there.   Voyage was to be made through Panama. Canal and. stock of coal would be replenished in certain ports of United States,   This vessel encountered heavy storm West of Faroe Islands incurring damage necessitating return to Netherlands for repairs.   On March 21st large part of Dutch mercantile Fleet was seized. After this event it was resolved to send the &quot;Hertog Hendrik&quot;,after completion of repairs, round Cape Good Hope accompanied by her own collierAccord-ing to plan fixed previously for 1918 warship &quot;Zeeland&quot; would likewise leave for &quot;ast Indies in June chiefly for relief of naval personnel in Colonies. As owing to adverse circumstances the &quot;Hertog Hendrik11 could only undertake voyage sd much later it was obvious that both ships should he -i despatched
,JeBpfcL-tch6d together-In. -consequence of Which one collier would suffice.   In connection with damage to holler or hoard old warship &quot;Kortenaer&quot; &quot;necessitating temporary withdrawal from home&apos; defence service it was considered desirable to keep the&apos; &quot;Zealand&quot; in Motherlands and it was resolved to transform a merchant steamer into warship according to rules of Seventh Convention&apos; of&apos; Second Hagu.e Peace Conference and to send this vessel to East Indies in place of the &quot; eeland&quot;..   As a&apos;large number of Government officials and officers of Indian Array have long Waited for shipping opportunity and it was moreover necessary to send Government goods urgently by merchant steamer or requisition one and to send it for needed (sic) in Color ins,Government resolved to charter transport of said passengers and goods with above mentioned warships in convoy, Warships will therefore only carry naval personnel and war supplies and the merchant ships only Government passengers with their families and Government goods. It is not intended to in-stitirte under protection of warships commercial intercourse which without such protection&apos;would not be permitted by the belligerents according to their views of commercial liberty of neutrals.   No mail will be carried, It is obvious that convoy commandant would not tolerate any examination of the convoyed ships. According to usage he will on meeting belligerent warships permit perusal of cargo documents inhis
** 3 wMs custody by Commander at latter&apos;s request. In fact those documentor &quot;will be communicated to powers concerned before departure from Netherlands. As is customary in these times when despatching warships with view to preventing misunderstanding in event of meeting belligerent warships notice has been given to Governments of belligerents of the despatch of the convoy. Besides warship &quot;Hertog Hendrik&quot; under command of Captain De Joncheere who is convoy Com-mandant,the convoy will consist of s,s* &quot;Tabanan&quot;transformed into auxiliary cruiser of Rotterdam Lloyd under command of Captain Gooszen and very probably steamer &quot;Noordarn&quot;of Holland America Line as passenger ship and s.,s,&quot;Bengkalis&quot; of Neder-land Company as collier. Ships will leave Roadstead of Texel about middle of June and avoiding on voyage areas de-Glared by belligerents to be dangerous win proceed round Cape; Goua Hope, .Stock of coal will be replenished as far as neces-eary cut of &quot;Bengkalis&quot;either in neutral ports or at sea outside territorial, waters of belligerents. Duration of voyage estimated at. about three and half months,   Ends.,(1,6. 8/4),
