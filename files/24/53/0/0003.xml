This Document is the Property of * His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government &apos;/ ,EGRET, /7       AWAR   CABINET.GOVERN ENT   ORGAII SAT 1033.Memorandum by Mr. A. Chamber 1 ain. (Circulated to War Cabinet only),4660. Mr. Long&apos;s Memorandum on the Ministry of Health Bill &amp; raises a broad question of Government organisation on which I think a decision of the Cabinet should be taken.It&apos;jjr. Long writes, &quot;I ask leave, with groat respeot, to say that having had many years&apos; experience of legislation, preparing Bil.ls &amp;c, I cannot believe that it is wise to ask a Minister who is not the Head of a Department, and therefore has not the immense advantage of the counsel, advice, experience, of the great Civil Servants connected with the Department to help him in his task to prepare a Eill dealing with a Department of which he has no personal knowledge, with which he is in no way connected, and which must of necessity resent this attempt to - as it were -override the Head of the Department, and ask him to accoipt a measure of which he disapproves, and in the preparation of which he has not even been allowed to take an active fpart. . V/e have had more than one illustration in recent years of the ill-effects which follow from this method of legislation and I confess I believe that the old plan is the better $ one, that the Cabinet should make up their minds that a , Eill is to be introduced for a particular purpose, should lay down broad lines upon which that Bill is to be drawn, and then leave it to the Head of the Department mainly concerned to produce the Bin for discussion and consideration by a Committee and ultimate adoption by the Cabinet.&quot;I heartily agree with the principle stated by Mr. Long that Bills should be the expression of the common policy of the Government and that both the policy and the Bills should be prepared and matured by joint ministerial con-si deration.   In ordinary times this result is secured by the normal working of the Cabinet system.   To-day it has broken down because the War Cabinet comprises only a few and not the whole body of the principle ministers and because the demands upon the time of the Cabinet leave its members no leisure for the careful discussion of the Bills and the problems with which they deal, and because in the absence of full Cabinet discussion the Ministers principally concerned are afforded no regular or sufficient opportunity for interchange of thought at the initial stage or for reconciling slight differences of opinion as they arise. The result is overlapping.and confusion of authority, friction between Departments and a growing feeling among ministers outside the Cabinet that they are insufficiently consulted on matters of general interest and inadequately supported by their colleagues and the War Cabinet.I venture to suggest What I believe would prove a satisfactory, solution of these difficulties.Sir E. Carson in his Report on the work of the Economic Offensive Committee clearly contemplated the estabUshmeht, under the name of a Committee of Economic Defenoe and Development, of a Cabinet Committee of Ministers to deal with all questions of Economic policy subject to reference to the War Cabinet on matters of high policy.   This&apos;proposal is now being considered and worked out by the Committee undeT* Mr. Barnes&apos;s Chairmanship.
(Initialled)   A,C.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., May 3oth, 1918.I  QUggCBtj-I  (1)   that a similar fstwxding CaW-tiot Committee of the I Interior (or of Homo Affairs) slwtf.d he apj^ujyko4to consider all questions of internal policy,(8)   that it should be composed of the Home Secretary, president of the Board, of. Trade, andLocal;&apos; Government Board, &quot;and the iVl ulsters of fleeon-struct ion, Education and Labour, under the&quot; Chairmanship of the Home Secretary (if, as I suppose, a member of the V/ar Cabinet is not available,,)(3)   that it should meet regularly once a week at a fixed hour.(4)   that it should bo the duty of the Committee toconsider all domestic questions which require the co-operation of more than one Department, or of such importance that they would otherwise call for the consideration of the Cabinet.   The Com-mittec should have a wide discretion in dealing finally with questions on which agreement is reached, and should refer to the War Cabinet only such large questions of polloy as require Cabinet sanction or questions on which they have been unable to reach agreement.(5)   that the Secretary to the War Cabinet should have i n at ruet i on s to r ofer t o , t ho Commi11 c e all questions falling within their competence before they are brought to tho Cabinet unless there &quot;are special reasons of urgency which make this course impossible.For reasons of convenience in practical working I think it is desirable to keep, tho Committee small, but the Chairman should have authority to invite the attendance of other Ministers as occasion might require, and these Ministers should be authorised to seek the assistance of the Committee where they feel the need for it.Wo have had several Committees of this kind for specific questions which have done excellent work, but the essence of my proposal is that there should be a standing Committee of Ministers meeting regularly and charged with the general survey and direction of domestic policy on behalf of the War Cabinet.
