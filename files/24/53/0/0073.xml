Report relating to the War Work of the Board, of Agriculture for Scotland for the week end-*ing June 5th.FOOD PRODUCTION.Strong sunshine has been experienced during the whole week with some frost at night. The growth of the turnip crop has been seriously hindered and large areas have required to be resown owing to the disappearance of the young plants. Vegetar; rtion and cereal crops generally continue to look well although as before reported traces of the wireworm are still to be seen in certain districts.1T Mechanical prajnafte.With a view to investigating the possibilities of land drainage in Scotland the Board have decided, on the recommen-rdation of the Highland and Agricultural Society to purchase an American type of draining machine for trial under Scottish con-tditions.    The machine selected is a No. 1 Buckeye caterpillar traction which is capable of digging drains Hi inches and 14-J inches wide by 4  feet deep.Hth regard to the arrangements for testing and using the drainer, the Board have asked the Highland and Agricultural Society to be responsible for the trial and hiring of the machine for one year and the Society have agreed to undertake the duties on condition that the Board meet any loss on the management of the drainer.    It may be added that the Society have agreed to prepare a report on the trial and to defray any expenses incurred in the production of the report from their own funds.3. Allotments.The Board are at present considering the question of introducing legislation for facilitating the provision of land in burghal and other areas for allotment purposes.    The ex-:tension of allotments in Scotland is demonstrated by the fact that in 1917 there were 22,817 allotments covering 1815 acres in burgal areas, and 3571 covering 262 acres in parishes.    Since the beginning of 1918 more land has been utilised for allotments and from returns to date 7074 additional allotments oovering 302 acres have been formed in burgal areas.3. Corn Production Act 1917.formation of Wages Committees.All the District Agricultural Wages Committees have been certified and in terms of the Regulations dated 23rd April already reported are in a position to undertake the duties imposed on them by the Corn Production Act.    fxom the five Combination Districts of the 12 District Wages Committees representatives of Employees and Workmen have been elected to the Central Committee.    The constitution of the Central Committee is as follows:*irman -      Sir James Wilson, K.C.8.I.ected /

COLLECTION OF STATISTICS AND RETURNS RELATING TO AGRICULTURE, BETBs UNDER THE POTATOES (GRQV/ERS^RETUKlIsTol^R. 1917.The tabulation of the Returns for let May has now been completed, and a summary table ie appended showing the results.    The quantity returned as consumed or delivered during April, viz., 93,800 tons, is less than that returned as consumed or delivered during March by 14,700 tons, or 13.5 per cent.III. SCOTTISH WOMgN&apos;8 RURAL INSTITUTES.At the last meeting of the Advisory Committee it waB decided that a Women&apos;s Institute Conference should be convened in Edinburgh at an early date to discuss the constitution of institutes.    This has been rendered desirable owing to the fact that there is at present no representative Committee to control funds which are donated to the Institutes and that such a Committee can only be formed satisfactorily at the instance of representatives of Institutes in all parts of the country. It is proposed to hold the meeting during the current month.The following table giveB a list of Institutes whichhave /

The local scrutiny of applications for the exemption ofmen decertified under the Royal Proclamation of 20th April is now praotically oompleted, and the disputed cases are under con-ssideration by the Ministry of National Servioe and the Board. The number of men actually posted towards the quota of 5500 up to 3rd June was about 1100, or one-fifth of the whole.    The proportion varies greatly, however, in ths different areas.2. Under the Decertification Order of 28th May all menengaged in-agriculture and allied industries are decertified as from 11th June, and will in future (if not called up for military service) be protected not by Tribunal certificates but by vouchers issued by the Board or in such other fashion as may be arranged with the Ministry of National Service.3. With a view to the completion of the quota of 5500, menfrom 23 to 31 will be called up for medical examination, and as many men of Grade 1 as may be necessary will be called up for service.    It is not, however, anticipated that it will be found necessary to go beyond the age of 27 for this purpose.Applications for the exemption of these men have to be made to the Secretary of the District Agricultural Executive Committee not later than the 6th June, if the man had been plaoed in Grade I before 28th May, or if he had not been ex-tamined at that date, within 4 days of the date of his ex-jamination and grading.    A circular has been issued to the Secretaries of District Agricultural Executive Committees on this subject.have been formed to date in Scotland:-County. No. of Institutes.
