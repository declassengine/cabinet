That is a question which has been in a good many people&apos;s mouths during the last few weeks, especially since the visit of the American Labour representatives. The unqualified refusal of the Americans, again and again repeated, to consider the possibility of meeting German Socialists in an International Conference until they have clone many things which they are quite certain not to do, such, as destroying their own militarists, has led to the most open cleavage which has yet occurred in the French party. On the one hand, the Minority press denounces the childish &quot; war-to-a-finish &quot; attitude of the Americans (&quot; jusqu&apos;auboutisme pueril et simpliste&quot;); on the other hand, a large section of the Majority, headed by M. Varenne, who accepted the Ministry of Public Instruction in M. Painleve s Ministry and only withdrew regretfully from a sense of party discipline, have published an address to the Americans emphatically welcoming the very attitude which is so distasteful to M. Longuet and the Minority. The two sections have never before acted in quite such open opposition to each other : What will come of it ?Their divergence has been steadily increasing for a long time. It has chiefly centred in the dispute &quot;about holding an International Conference. At first all except a few Extremists, less than half-a-dozen in number, were united in opposition to any proposals to meet German Socialists during the war. But the section headed by Longuet, the grandson of Karl Marx, and especially Longuet himself, have always at heart cared more about the International, than about the national, point of view. Longuet, a man of no very great ability, is the typical theorist who has got hold of an idea rather too big for him, and will not consider, or even admit the existence of, any facts that might compel him to the difficult task of adjusting his idea to new circumstances or modifying it in the light of experience. His acceptance of the renunciation of the old Liter-national Socialism which, of course, included Germany, was reluctant from, the first. And he and a considerable section of the party eagerly seized the opportunity created by the Russian revolution and the Russian desire for a Conference to push the party into accepting the idea of meeting the Germans at Stockholm. The Socialist delegates who had been in Russia, among whom was M. Thomas, believed that it was very important that some concession should be made to Russian opinion in this matter, and that to refuse altogether might lose the Allies the support of Russia in the war. The Majority felt that the concession was a large one to make, but they made it, both on public grounds and to maintain the unity of the Socialist party. But the French and other Governments declined to grant passports, so that the proposed Conference could not take place. Nor did the German Socialists ever accept the preliminary conditions which had been laid down by the French when they accepted the principle of a Conference.But the fact that the Conference, so eagerly desired by the one section, so reluctantly accepted by another, and not accepted at all by some members of the party, never, in fact, took place, did not prevent the divergence in the party continuing and increasing. There was too little common ground between the Majority and Minority to make it possible to hold them together by any accepted compromises. After all, the Right wing, headed by M. Varenne, and the Centre, headed by Thomas and Renaudel, meant one thing and the Left wing meant another. Longuet had indulged in pacifist agitations even in 1.915, and he and his friends scarcely concealed their desire to begin discussing peace terms at once, and with anybody, and without any guarantee as to what sort of peace it was to be. Thomas, on the other hand, and still more Varenne,. were definitely in favour of a vicboire integrate and definitely against a paix quelconque.[367-17] BCONFIDENTIAL. [may 30, 1918.]
The division came to a head at the Nationalist Socialist Conference at Bordeaux in October. Thomas went there with the intention of getting all but the handful of Kienthaliau extremists to unite on a definite policy at once Socialist and National. In this lie failed. Longuet would not break altogether with the Extreme Left. The result was a trial of strength between Bight and Centre on the one hand and all sections of the Left on the other. The result was that the Left, or the Minority sections, were defeated, heavily on a proposal to refuse credits, much less heavily on a resolution making passports for an International Conference a condition of Socialist participation in any Ministry. The Right, in fact, would have had a majority even if the Centre had gone with the Minority ; and the resolution carried, which demanded a vigorous prosecution of the war and advocated co-operation of Socialists in the work of national defence, plainly expressed their spirit and was the exact opposite of Longuet&apos;s.Thus the Pacifist Minority had, on the whole, a set-hack at Bordeaux where they had hoped to carry all before them. But soon after this came the fall of the Painlove Ministry and the accession of M. Clernenceau to power in the teeth of the opposition of the Socialists and of the whole of the Extreme Left of the Chamber. Labour as a whole, too, was extremely suspicious of Cleinenceau, who had dealt drastically with strikes during his former Premiership. The consequence of this was a certain further drift of the Socialists towards pacifism. Because Clemenceau&apos;s motto was &quot; Je fais la guerre,&quot; theirs tended to be &quot; Peace by understanding&quot; ! So when the largest of the Socialist confederations, that of the Seine, met in February, the startling fact was brought out that there, at any rate, the Minority had become the Majority, and even the extremist Kienthalians were able to elect two delegates to the National Council as agaiust three secured by the Majority and seven by the Minority. Resolutions were also carried against further support of votes of credit and against any participation in the Government, and one or two very Bolshevik speeches were made. This showed the seriousness of the drift in the Defaitiste direction. It was somewhat corrected when the National Council itself met immediately afterwards. M. Renaudel, the leader of the whole party, and M. Albert Thomas, insisted on a clear vote to show whether the old Majority was still the Majority or not. The result was that they had an immense majority on the acceptance of the text as to war aims which they had prepared for the London AUied Socialist Conference, although they had refused to include in it some points (such as a plebiscite about Alsace-Lorraine as a matter of right), which were demanded by the Minority. Here the Minority were no doubt afraid to go too far for fear of endangering the alliance with the English. Labour men whose leaders had just addressed them, and without whose co-operation it was obvious that neither the Conference or any of their other aims were likely to be obtained. The Majority had much more difficult^/ in carrying their second resolution affirming the policy of supporting the credits as a &quot; symbol of national defence,&quot; and it was only after some sharp passages of arms between Thomas and Longuet that it was passed by 1,548 to 1,415.This narrow division is the high-water mark, hitherto attained by the Pacifist Minority.&apos; The London Conference adopted a programme of war aims which was accepted by the Minority, and was, on the whole, not very different from those stated by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George. The revelations made by M. Pichon as to the amazing German demands about Toul and Verdun, the general discredit thrown on extreme views everywhere by the bluster of the Bolsheviks and their ignominious collapse as well as by their shameful desertion of the cause of freedom, the cynical and outrageous peace of Brest, the failure of the German Socialists, either to make any serious protest against that defiance of all Socialist principles, or to show any sign of interest in the Allied Socialist war aims, of which they could hardly fail to be wholly ignorant, all tended to open eyes that were capable of being opened. Then came the crash of the great offensive of the 21st March; and at once the whole party, or practically the whole, rallied to the cause of National Defence. Only seven deputies (against 490) were found ready to vote against the calling up the further recruits needed for the army. The Socialists who had intended to go to America decided to remain at their posts at home and &quot; share the common danger &quot; ; the workmen decided to have no May Day holiday; the Socialist official organ began to publish articles admitting that it was impossible to count on German Socialists, and that the only place in which German Imperialism could be dealt with was the field of battle.But it sOon appeared that the Defaitistes were merely silenced by the German guns; they had learnt no permanent lessons from them. Even before the long lull in the offensive began, the speech of Count Czernin and the subsequent discussion
about Austrian overtures for peace showed that they had not unlearnt either the blindness of their hatred of Olemenceau, or the blindness of their determination to believe that any talk about peace, from whatever quarter it came, powerful or powerless, sincere or insincere, was promising, valuable, and a thing to be encouraged. Their amazing detachment from realities was further shown by a proposal to celebrate the centenary of the German Marx, who had again and again expressed his desire that the French should be soundly beaten in 1870, had welcomed the German victory as the beginning of a German preponderance in Europe, and had declared that the Latin races were destined to disappear. Whatever counterbalancing virtues such a man may have had, and even though he had made a tardy protest against the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, his was obviously a.strange memory to propose to celebrate when German armies, with the applause of German Socialists, were thundering within a few miles of Amiens. The proposal had to be hurriedly abandoned in face of protests from all quarters.Into this atmosphere of reviving Pacifism and renewed talk about the holding of an International Congress came, early in May, the delegates of the American Federation of Labour. Just before their arrival M. Branting, ex-Minister and pro-Ally leader of. the moderate Swedish Socialists, had published a letter vigorously denouncing the German Socialists and saying that a party which behaves as they behave in presence of their Government &quot; had nothing in common with Socialism,&quot; and &quot; declared its own exclusive from the International.&quot; The American leaders soon showed, to the disgust of Longuet and in his presence, their entire agreement with this view. One of the Minority Socialist papers complained that some of these speeches were such as might have been applauded by the ex-Socialist Gustave Herve and the Royalist Maurras. The line the Americans took up again and again may be given in a single sentence from a speech by their president, who said, &quot; Never under any form will we agree to hold a conference with the German Socialists till they have themselves struck down German militarism, which forms an unbridgeable gulf between us and them.&quot;Branting&apos;s letter and the American declarations furnished the stimulus, which was all that had been needed to push the Majority Socialists into open action. There are about 100 Socialist deputies in the Chamber. Forty of them signed a letter to Branting applauding the line he had taken and declaring that the only object for which they would meet the German Socialists was that of seing them condemned and excluded by the judgment of the International, and that, even if a failure of the German offensive led the German Socialists once more to make pretences of supporting a democratic peace, they would remember the past and know what such pretences were worth. The same party soon afterwards handed an address to the Americans, saying that it was only to please the Russians that they had consented to revive the International, and that, as the Russians had deserted the common cause, they were entitled to withdraw their consent. &quot;There is no conversation possible, in our view, with men who have shown themselves strangers to the most elementary principles of liberty and right.&quot; They add that this is a definite decision which they mean to maintain and carry out. The documents were publicly issued by the forty, who included two or three Marxists ; though, of course, most of them were moderate men of the type of Varennes and Compere-Morel. &apos;Naturally the two addresses fell like a bombshell among the party. Thomas and Renaudel had not been consulted, and were embarrassed and indignant. The unity of the party, for which they had made such sacrifices to the Minority, especially in this very matter of an international congress, was now threatened by the indignant Majority, encouraged by the attitude of the Americans. Their position is indeed a very uncomfortable one, as between Longuet on one side and Varenne on the other their own following is reduced to about fifteen Deputies. Longuet has of course denounced both the Americans and Varenne as no true Socialists at all. The Executive Committee of the party has met and passed a long resolution regretting separate manifestations of sections of the party, and declaring that such action tends to compromise not only the unity of the party, but its agreements with the Socialists of Allied countries. There is no question of expelling Varenne and his supporters. Nor have they any intention of leaving, the party. They claim the right to remain even if the Majority of the party should disagree with them, as the Minority and even the Kienthalians have remained, though often in violent disagreement with the decisions of the party as a whole. At the same time, they announce their intention of lorming an organisation in support of their views.What will come of all this ?  The line taken by the Executive Committee, and.[367-17] B 2 &apos;
particularly by Renaudel in the &quot; Humanite,&quot; the official organ of the party, is to hush the whole affair up as much as possible, pretend there is no great difference between the Americans and Longuet, and assert that the unity of the party is not threatened. And it is quite true that the London Socialist Conference did not propose an unconditional International Conference. It required that all who were to meet at it should have precisely formulated their conditions of peace, which should be based on self-determination, and that they should be working with all their might to obtain guarantees of support for this policy from their Governments. But it is no use pretending that this approaches the position of Varenne and the Americans. Not only are the American conditions much stiller. The real difference is a difference of emphasis. The Minority want an International and in practice lay no stress on the conditions. The Americans do not want one at all and lay all their stress on the things that block the way. It is the same about peace negotiations. M. Renaudel, who is not himself suspect in this matter, is always insisting that not even Longuet desires a peace at any price. But in practice what Longuet wants is to begin talking about peace at once, and he does not wish to make any difficulty about conditions: what the Americans and Varenne believe is that peace is worthless unless it be the peace of security and of justice, and that talk about it is dangerous unless it is clearly understood that it is that peace and that only which can be discussed. These views are reconcilable on paper perhaps: but the men who hold the one sort can never co-operate very closely with those who hold the other.The truth is that all over the world the same parting of the ways is going on in the Socialist and Labour parties. It is at its sharpest in Russia where one party is in power and deals drastically with the other; it is conspicuous in Italy; it is visible in England, or may be seen in the speeches made yesterday (the 29th May) by Mr. Roberts and others.It is useless to try to smooth over these differences or hush up inconvenient words used by the Americans as Renaudel does. To do so has only provoked contradiction and reassertion by the speakers. The difference is vital. &quot;Dont talk so much about the war,&apos;&apos; called out Longuet to one of them : &quot; Tell us about the social movement in the United States.&quot; To which the speaker, Mr. Berry, replied : &quot; In the face of the enemy there is no social movement in my country; there is only a national movement.&quot; That is the vital distinction. One set of men think in terms of the International, the class struggle and so forth; they tend to be incapable of seeing any virtue in capitalists or any wickedness in the proletariat anywhere. They are very clear-sighted about the faints of M. Poincare or M. Clemenceau, and turn a blind eye to those of the German Socialists. The other set are primarily Frenchmen or Englishmen defending their own countries; and when they get outside the national issue their feelings are not so much those of workmen or Socialists as those of men defending the cause of humanity against a conspiracy of crime.What will be the result of M. Varenne&apos;s action on French politics ? No doubt the forty deputies will refuse in future to follow the Socialist party if it goes in ior the more violent sort of opposition, or takes any action inconsistent with the vigorous prosecution of the war. And probably Varenne and others will be offered, and will accept, office, which, it is known that Varenne desires. But will they from a public point of view serve the cause they wish to support more effectively by their present attitude than by their past? The answer is probably &quot;yes&quot; if they can remain in the party; &quot;no&quot; if they leave it or are driven out. The Socialist party aud the Confederation Generate du Travail include in their membership only a very small minority of the French working-classes, but they are the only bodies representing working-class opinion which are in constant touch, as they even now are, with the Government of the country. It is very desirable that the moderate element should be well represented in them. Good judges doubt whether Varenne has even now any very large following among the Socialist rank and file. He will have fewer still if he leaves the party. Longuet and the Minority may be right or wrong; but they are sincere, earnest with the earnestness of something like fanaticism, industrious and indefatigable. They have just founded a new paper, the &quot; Populaire.&quot; If the party is left to their management it will be a smaller party in the country, and a much smaller one in the Chamber, but it will be more aggressive. Without the support of Varenne&apos;s section Thomas and. Renaudel will be unable to control it, with the result that it will certainly drift more and more in the Pacifist direction. And it will perforce look more for support to the more extreme section of the workmen. In France, as everywhere, there is a dangerous ferment at work, as has been seen in the recent strikes in which some of the men defied and denounced
the leaders of the central organisation of metal workers, and showed a temper so suspicious of the Government that they were ready to believe a report obviously put about by German agents that they were being sent to the front in order that American workmen might take their places. It is said in Paris that the strikes were started by the Minority Socialists to show Clemenceau their power. This is, however, a doubtful rumour; all that is known is that the Socialist and Labour leaders were called into consultation by M. Clemenceau, and between his action and theirs it was settled. Still there is that temper, and it is obviously important that it should not become dominant in the Socialist party, and that the Socialist party should not get out of touch with the Government, as it might if Longuet and his friends got sole control of it.The gravity of the military situation will no doubt prevent for. the moment any acute development of the Socialist divisions. But it is difficult not to think that, however regrettable in the national interest, it will come before very long. In the end there generally comes a moment when the Whigs in a Liberal party find, as Lord Hartington said, that they and the Radicals &quot; do not mean the same thing.&quot; And the recent activity of both wings is ominous : the new Minority paper founded, on the one hand, and two new Majority organisations, on the other the Majority actively allying itself with the non-Socialist Americans, the Minority always making the best case it can for the Bolsheviks. Can such a union last ? Meanwhile, the principal, immediate, and visible result of Varenne&apos;s action is a further strengthening of the parliamentary position of Clemenceau, who, unless he makes some strange blunder, need have no more fear of seeing the whole Socialist party vote against him in a critical division about the issues of war and peace. That is a useful additional strength to the man who is already described by well-informed Frenchmen as more popular than any public mam in France has been for years.
