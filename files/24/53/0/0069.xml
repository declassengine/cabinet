(1)5th June. 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 4th June, 1918:-The Weather,Last week&apos;s weather was generally fine and warm.     In some districts rain is wanted, but in most the heavy downpours of the previous week, and subsequent heavy dews have kept the crops growing well.     The reports as to the condition of the crops are, speaking generally, very favourable, except in the case of fruit. The potatoes, on the other hand, look exceptionally well both on the old and new land,LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.   &apos; Agricultural Executive Committees. Gloucestershire.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 39 acres of land, forming an outlying portion of a gSebs farm near Andoversford, which the occupier appears to be quite unable to cultivate satisfactorily.     There are no buildings and all the produce is sold off the farm.     It will probably become necessary to take possession of the remaining 55 acres of the farm.Surreyb   The Committee have taken possession of 68 acres of derelict land at Chipstead, 60 acres of which form part of a building estate.     The whole of the land is covered with thorn bushes and has been let by the Committee to a tenant who will reclaim it, a money contribution being made to assist him in doing so.
Worcestershire,   The Committee have been authorised to take    q possession of 275 acres of land forming part of two farms occupied by the owner.     They are in bad condition owing to neglect, the arable land being foul, the grass starved, the hedges overgrown and the ditches uncleared.    The District Commissioner reports that it is hopeless to expect any improvement while the land remains under the owner1s control.     The Executive Committee took possession of, and let to a neighbouring farmer, 56 acres of the arable land on one of these farms in March, 1917, Prosecutions.   The Earl of Aylesford was fined  70 and costs for failure to comply with an order to plough up 15 acres of grass-land in Warwickshire.    The magistrates stated that they would have imposed the maximum penalty of  100 had this not been the first case of the kind that had come before thera.    a farmer at Rendcombe, Gloucestershire, was fined  15 and costs for non-compliance with an order to plough up 39&apos; acres.     It was stated in Court on behalf of the Executive Committee that 7,000 acres had been ploughed up in the Cotswolds in accordance with orders issued by them, and that the defendant was the only farmer in that district who had disobeyed such an order.     A farmer at Arlington, East Sussex, was fined  50 for not complying with an order to break up 50 acres of land.     Three farmers in Denbighshire were fined  45,  25 and  15 respectively for non-compliance with orders of this kind.     Five farmers have been fined for similar offences in Radnorshire,Drainage of Land.   The East Riding Committee are commencing work under Paragraph (h) of Regulation 2M on the Howden Dyke Drain. Determination of Tenancies.   During the week 4 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 323 acres, and 3 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 176 acres.
HORTICULTTJRAIi DIVISION. Provision of Land for Allotments..  Reports received from 1,167 districts show that 304,302 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order* 1917; (No.2), and that 277,283 plots containing 19 t\rr-es have been provided.Iiuring the week 7 Local Authorities have undertaken to acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above, 20 acres (291 allotments) including an additional 7 acres at Portsmouth.    The owner of 2 acres (9 allotments) at Chinnor* Oxford, had given the tenants notice to. quit, but the Department has been able to arrange for the continuance of the tenancy for the duration of the war,The aggregate area under allotments at Penarth (South Dfales) is now 80 acres, which is equal to 24 square yards per head of the population.     It is estimated that, including private gardens, 8 to 10 poles per house are under vegetable cultivation, Fruit Section.   Conferences have been held between the Ministry of Food and the Department during the past week in connection with the prices to be fised for soft fruits, such as gooseberries, strawberries, eto.    Special inquiries made by officers of the Department indicate that the fruit crops generally arp seriously below the average and are not likely to yield sufficient to provide the fruit necessary for jam-making purposes.    The Ministry of Food proposes to arrange for the purchase, on behalf of the controlled jam-making firms, of the larger part of the soft fruit crops, and to fix the prices at which fruit for jam-making may be sold.   This means that only the fruit produced by small growers will reach the market, and the large growers will have to content themselves with the prices fixed by the Ministry of Food.The Ministry of Food has fixed the price of gooseberries at  27 per ton, which should give a reasonable return to the average grower,The Ministry of Food has concurred with the suggestion made by the Department that active steps should be taken to
Jencourage the largest possible production of vegetable marrows to be used to supplement fruit In Jam-making.    Steps have been taken to. give wide publicity to the need for a largely extended^ acreage of this crop, and ,it is estimated that from 10,000 to 20,000 tons of marrows will be required.Agricultural^Baskets.   The Department has received Information to the effect that a large firm of Covent Garden merchants have obtained the delivery of 16,000 baskets from Holland, Preservation of Fruit and Vegetables.   107 demonstrations in bottling, canning and drying fruit and vegetables have been given during the past-week.    The Department gave demonstrations In fruit and vegetable preservation to nearly 14,000 people at the Brighton Exhibition, and at Bournemouth an exhibition was visited by 7,500 , people.The total number of jars for fruit.preservation ordered through the Glassware, Supply. Department, of the. Ministry Of Munitions now amounts to 6,373,860, of. which 2,426,784 have been delivered.TECHNICAL DIVISION.   . Failure of Corn In. East Suffolk... Ten fields, comprising about 100 acres; of newly-ploughed grassland-, were inspected by one of the Technical, Advisers accompanied by the. Executive.. Of floer and a member of the District Committee.    All, but one of the fields had been broken up in, or subsequent to., January 19.18.   It was too late to determine with certainty ;the, cause of the failed crops.&apos;    WIreworms were present, but no leather Jackets or slugs were seen..    Predisposing causes were Inadequate, preparation of the :seed-bed and the absence of readily available plant food.    The land appears to have been ploughed well enough but not consolidated;   it is quite hcllow below.    Only the usual Implements at hand were used.    No presses or disc harrows appear to have been available.     In most cases the farmers had made no attempt to mend the crops, the explanation being lackof labour and anticipation of compensation.     Suggestions for -replacing or otherwise&apos;dealing with the failures were made.
A new porn Drill.   An inspection was made of about 50 r\cres of corn sown with a-drill, invented by a Canterbury seedsman, which is adapted for sowing corn, artificial manures and lime In one operation.    The advantages of tne method are that it economises seed and manure, encourages strong plants, and permits of inter-ttillage by horse drawn Implements,    Some of the land sown with this drill gives promise of excellent crops, and although the drill is at present a crude and clumsy machine, the underlying principles appear to be sound, and the invention suggests useful lines of experiment.Inspection of Land.   The Department is arranging to inspect all farms taken over and farmed by Executive Committees, and under this scheme one of the Technical Advisers visited a farm recently taken over by the Worcestershire Agricultural Executive Committee,    The soil is a heavy clay and a considerable area of the foul&apos;and derelict land was being summer fallowed with a view to securing wheat in 1919,    The summer grazing of part of the grass land had been let at very satisfactory prices and a number of young cattle purchased to graze the rest of the pasture. The work of the farm was well in hand and the management appeared to be sound and energetic.Plant Diseases,    Experiments- with different insecticides against Caps id Bug on apples are in progress in the W-isbech district, and excellent results are reported,LABOUR DIVISION. Recruiting.   In pursuance of the policy arranged between the Department and the Ministry of National Service, namely to adopt greater de-centralisation in future as regards recruitment for Military Service of men from agriculture and kindred industries, the Ministry have issued a de-certification order withdrawing
exemptions held on occupational grounds by men in these occupations.    In future such men, except those who have been^j selected to form part of the quota of 30,000 Grade I men to be released from agriculture before the 30th June, will be entitled to receive;&apos; certificates from their County Agricultural Executive Committee.Soldier Labour..   The number of soldiers made available - to date for agricultural work is 61,673.    Of these men 57,952 are out on farms, the balance being accounted for by staff, men sick, men under training, etc*War Agricultural Volunteers.; Instructions have been issued to all Agricultural Executive Committees with reference to the scheme ;pf the Ministry of National Service for the enrolment of War. ^Agricultural Volunteers.     It will be the particular business cf the Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour to enrol and plase these volunteers with employers, but the Department are also musing the Agricultural Executive Committees for the ^enrolment&apos; and placing, of any suitable volunteers who may apply direct to them instead of to the Employment Exchanges.    As regards volunteers enrolled by Employment Exchanges, the approval of the County Agricultural Executive Committees will be obtained in every case before such volunteers are actually placed with farmers. ^Provision has been made that any man not already employed in /agriculture, and who has attained the age of 45 may be enrolled as a War Agricultural Volunteer without regard to his medical category.    , Men who have not yet attained the age of 45 years may be enrolled if ,tftey. are not liable for Military Service or are in medical Category-B3, C3 or Grade 3.1 Prisoners of WarTwo additional agricultural prisoner camps have&apos;been opened during.the week.    Information has been received   j from the $astern and. Southern Commands that up to the present time 134 combatant prisoners of war have been sent out withoi^
guard to bo boarded and lodged by farmers under the conditions of the scheme issued in January last,     The returns from the Northern and Western Commands have not yet been received.     The total number of prisoners now employed on farm or drainage work is as follows:-Prom 189 agricultural camps ........i...,10^652Employed,from other camps ............... 1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farm3 ,134&quot;117794Released aliens employed In agriculture.. 1,912&quot;&quot;13,706158 schemes for additional camps in fresh districts, providing for the employment of a further 9,605 prisoners in agriculture, are now with the War Office. Harvest Labour,   An estimate has been prepared of the extra labour that will be required for the coming hay and corn harvests and the Ministry of National Service has been asked to supply the labour required.women&apos;s Branch.Recruiting,    Recruiting in Trafalgar Square has been very brisk, 76 recruits having been enrolled during the week. .    Dinner hour meetings in the city have been continued this week with success, and have also bean held on the steps of the Royal Exchange and in St. Paul1s Churchyard.     46 recruits were enrolled in Hyde Park on Thursday, 25 on Friday, and 54 on Saturday.531 recruits have been enrolled by the Headquarters1 Recruiting staff this week, as against 334 last week.Very successful rallies have been held at Exeter, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Southampton, Ryde, Colchester, Hitchin. Uttoxeter, Luton and Derby*     The type of women who came forward at Plymouth last week was so good that 57 candidates were selected out of 60 interviewed at one of the Selection Boards.Housing accommodation is proving a great difficulty, and special camping arrangements are usually necessary, but equipment is not available,
The demand for.forewomen is growing, and in many counties they are found locally.     It is essential to send forewomen with gangs of untrained women.Training. 29 new Training Centres and Practice Farms to acoommo&amp;te&apos; 110 girls have been established during the week, Gang Hostels have also been opened in Stafford, Bedford, Denbighshire, and Shropshire,It is reported that,in the village of Long Melford, West. Sussex, there were only two women who ever worked on the land before the war, while at the present moment there are 62 working 48 hours per week.10.^626 women are accounted for in the Land Army as follows:-In Instruction Centres     ......   ...    1,734On Farm work   ... .........    7,641Lent to the Forage Department......        195&quot;   &quot;   Timber &quot;        ......        175Waiting for references to be placed inTraining Centres   .... ...   ... 672Waiting in their own Homes       ,..... 150Waiting in Depots       ... ...   ,.. 5910,626Women&apos;s Institutes.Fourteen new Institutes have been started this week, CULTIVATION DIVISION, The following statement shows the position regarding the provision of tractors, machinery and Implements owned by, the Department:-Total Number consigned   Number consigned to to Counties to date,     counties during week.Tractors      ...... -4,017                            2SPloughs        ...... 5,126                               33Cultivators 9/11 tine 1,351                             24&quot;    Disc Pattern 671 .:Pressers 3 ring     ... 202.                         .  -Trailer Boxes        ... 810&quot;          &quot;   Stones Patent  . 100Ford Box Vans        ... 960Ford &amp; other Touring Cars 48Threshing Machines... 128Horse Drawn Implements.Binders        ...Carts and Lorries .

Henry Ford and Sons.     Some 40 Tractors a day are being delivered to private purchasers in this way.Deliveries of Binders from the U,S. A* have decreased during the last few weeks.    Every effort is being made to expedite shipments, but the position causes a certain amount of anxiety. Technigal Seetion .   Owing to the objection of many farmers to a 12&quot; furrow, experiments are now being carried out with a view to making the Oliver ploughs (designed for use with the Fordson tractors) adjustable to turn either a 12n or a 10&quot; furrow. Herefordshire,   A tractor team In Herefordshire accomplished an amount of work equal,to 453 acres ploughed during the three months ended 3rd May.Lincoln (Holland).   A Fordson tractor cultivated 86 acres in 38 hours on a paraffin consumption of 1.34 gallons per acre. Gloucestershire.   A Fordson cross&quot;ploughed 23 acres in 40f hours on a paraffin consumption of 1.75 gallons per acre. Steam Tackle,   Most of the steam tackle sets are fully employed preparing land for roots, breaking up grass and stubble, and cultivating f al^ws 0 -Monthly Championship Shield.   For the second .time In. three months Hereford has secured the Championship Shield,.for the best month&apos;s performance, winning it from the Holland Division of Lincolnshire, which now appears second in the order of merit.The first twelve tractors are shown in order of meritbelow:-
SUPPLIES DIVISION,Basic Sla.g,     Special licences have been Issued to all makers of basic slag, authorising them to deliver 100,000 tons of     -J ground slag in&apos;England and Wales, during the next twelve months. Further licences will be issued shortly. Sulphate of Ammonia,   Special licences have been issued to makers to date for the delivery of 6,025 tons in the period June - August.    Enquiries for early June delivery are turnercus, and cover a larger quantity of sulphate of ammonia than will be,available between June and August.     This is most probably due to the reduction in price.Superphosphate.     The demand for superphosphate is now falling off.    Surplus stocks are available at Liverpool, Plymouth, Bristol and London.Lime *    At the&quot;end of 1917 arrangements were made for the sale of waste carbonate of lime produced at munition works in Cheshire to agents,appointed by the Department,     The lime is sold to farmers at 5/- per ton, and 5,600- tons had been sold up to the end of April,    The lime was merely dumped in the locality of the works before this arrangement was made. Nicotine,   Anxiety was felt last February with regard to the supplies of nicotine for the-present season.    Enquiries then made showed that one of the three firms engaged in the manufacture of nicotine ceased to produce last autumn, and another was much handicapped owing to the loss of men taken for Military Service, The Department immediately made arrangements whereby the former firm was enabled to re-start work.The following return has been obtained of the output and deliveries of nicotine in 1918 to the end of May, and inthe corresponding period of 1917:-Dellveries,1917 191822,394 lbs. 22,098 lbs.
3,608 lbs. of the 1918 output were produced by the firm   -which was enabled by the Department to re-start operations. But for this supply the amount available for the manufacture of insecticides would have been considerably deficient.Efforts are being made to divert supplies of nicotine to the fruit districts where a shortage is known to exist. Soft Soap.   Enquiries show that leading soap makers have up to the present been able to meet the demand for soft soap for the manufacture of insecticides. The Department has requested the Ministry of Food to ensure that ample supplies of raw materials are available.Binder Twine. Returns obtained from manufacturers and importers show that practically the whole of the privately manufactured and imported twine has been sold, and a demand is already being made for the supply held by the Department.Corn Sacks.   Arrangements are being made with the Army Contracts Department for a reserve stock of 500,000 sacks, suitable for the rail transport of British corn, to be held at the disposal of the Department.Wart DiseaseL (Potatoes).   The first reports proposing the certification of new infected areas under the Wart Disease of Potatoes Order of 1918, which came into operation on the 1st June, have now been prepared. The new areas will be certified as soon as possible.Steps will be taken by means of lectures, posters, notices in the press and other means to bring the requirements of the Order to the notice of occupiers of land in the affected districts.Prosecutions have been instituted against two merchants in Cambridgeshire referred to in last week&apos;s Report.   In one instance the offender has been fined  20 in all for two breaches of the Order, and in the other the fines in respect of eleven offences amount in all to  53. ;
Buckwheat Seed. 90 tons of the buckwheat seed which the Departme arranged to purchase in Prance has now been received and dispatch to the various selected agents who have purchased supplies from t Department.Exemption of Seed Exports.   The Order recently issued by the Mini of National Service with regard to the protection by Agricultural Executive Committees of certain classes of men connected with agriculture refers, so far as seedsmen are concerned, to men in t wholesale trade only.   The wholesale section of the seed trade fo only a very small proportion of the whole, and the Ministry of National Service Is being urged to allow retailers to be brought under the new arrangements on the same lines as the wholesalers.Unless prompt artion is taken to give protection to Hea of Departments and experts employed in the retail seed trade, the result as regards the supply of seeds in England and Wales will I calamitous.Revision of the Testing of Seeds Order.   The proposed alterations of the Testing of Seeds Order have, on the whole, met with the cordial support of the Seeds Advisory Committees of the Departmen A further joint meeting of these Committees Is to be held at an early date to consider the complete revised edition of the Order.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.,President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
