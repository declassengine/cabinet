r?5^^ I, milmiLWOmNIXJM FOR THE WAR CABINET.It r *^I am unable to agree with the view expressed . by several members of the Cabinet in our discussion yesterday that the proposals of the Irish Government entail an entire, /climb-down and acceptance of defeat by theBritish Government.The case ms argued yesterday as if the choice isbetween Conscription resulting in 150,000 recruits, or a voluntary system producing 20,000 by the 1st August, with a monthly instalment of 3,000.These are really not the alternatives.The Irish Government proposals mean - Firstly that Ireland is to be mads peaceful and law abiding, a difficult task perhaps, but one which will most certainly be accom-plished if the Irish Government are given a free hand and are supported by the Government in London,Secondly, that trained drafts can regularly be sent to France from the Regiments, quartered in Ireland. Thirdly that Unionists and Nationalists will unite in a real vigorous voluntary campaign, that a number (which I will not name, as I do not want to prophesy) of recruits will be obtained for the Irish Regiments, and that these Divisions will be kept up to strength.The other alternative means that the introduction simultaneously of Home Rule and Conscription will result in the Home Rule Bill - even if it were the most liberal that could possibly be conceived - being torn up and treated with contempt by the Nationalists all over Ireland, and vigorously resisted by the Unionists.Second, the Conscription Order will at once produceviolent
violent resistance in some parts of the country with con-sequent shooting and loss of life.    This will mean wide-spread disorder, and will prevent the release of any trained drafts i as Regiments will have to be kept up to their full strength, and the -number of recruits of any value which will be obtained is, to say the least, extremely problemati-cal owing to the ban of the Ghurch.    It seems to me that be-tween these two alternatives there can be no doubt as to the one which ought to be adopted.    But of course I recognise that the Government is in a difficulty, having announced their policy, and nailed their colours to the mast, and I am of course anxious to adopt a position consistent with credit and honour.    Personally I would have preferred, as I have pre-viously intimated, that the Government should face Parliament and the country and.state plainly that an entirely new sit-uation has arisen, not as the result of their policy, but in conseauence of the fact that the late Irish Government failed to deal vigorously and properly with disorder in the country; that in face of the fact that the Government are compelled to intern Sinn Feiners, to prosecute and sen^tto prison local leaders who are guilty of. disorder, it is impossible to accomplish the very difficult task of restoring law and order, and pursue at the same time the policy of reconstruc-tion and Cohsoription which some months ago was so far as their information went, capable of accomplishment. . I still think this would be the better course, but if it is rejected, then I submit that the only way in which the Government can maintain their position is by pursuing the policy npi? adopted in Ireland of a vigorous enforcement of the law and taking time to consider their general programme for the future. The Cabinet will remember that when we we dodiscussing
discussing the original proclamation, many or some of its members feared that the reference to the voluntary scheme would be regarded as an abandonment of their original policy. This no doubt has been the case in some quarters, but the Irish Nationalists and the leaders of local opinion in Ireland do not take this view.    They have stated quite plainly that so long as -the policy remains it is within the power of the British Government at any moment to enforce Conscription, and this is undoubtedly true.    The Irish people are by no means.fools. They are much cleverer as a race than the British, and unlike the latter, politics form a constant part of their daily life, and they know perfectly well that as long as the National Service Act remains, and the policy of the Government is.not deliberately abandoned, we can at any time apply Conscription. It is a fact - a curious, one perhaps but none the less a real one - that it would be easier to enforce Conscription than to carry Home Rule.    The former could be done, as I have already indicated, if my information is correct, at considerable cost of life and with very questionable results as regards recruits, but the latter is for the time being absolutely impossible. , To prove this I cannot do better than quote the words of a leading Nationalist, whose name I am unable to give, but with whom I discussed the whole situation at considerable length.    He said: &quot;You have made the position.in Ireland absolutely impossible.    If you had not introduced Conscription, and had gone on with Home Rule proposals, we who are not fools, would have realised that a National Government largely composed of Unionists could not by any possibility give us Home Rule powers similar to those contained in the Act of 1914, or in any way equal to that which we desire and mustdemand
demand, and if it had not been for the state of feeling created in the country by the Conscription cry we could,and many would, accept a very moderate measure, so anxious are. we for settlement, and we should justify our action by pointing to the fact that the measure came from a National Government and not from a Home Rule Ministry.But this you have made absolutely impossible.  The country is now from one end to the other, in a state of higji tension owing to its horror of Conscription, and whatever Bill you bring in it will be laughed at ard torn to pieces by every Home Ruler in the country, whether moderate or extreme. Now we think it is possible that you may bring in a Bill and when you find that Ireland will have nothing to say to it, you will abandon it and say &apos;We have done our duty, we have brought in a-Billj but Ireland won&apos;t have it, and therefore we withdraw it*.  In these circumstances what would be your position with regard to Conscription. You will have begun Conscription, you will have made an attempt at Home Rule which will blast your reputations for ever as statesmen, and you will have to decide whether you go on with Conscription without Home Rule, or whether you abandon it, and in my judgment you would be compelled by public opinion in England to abandon it and this after bloodshed and misery which the resistance of the people would have most un-doubtedly produced.    Further we Irishmen like to be treated as practical pssbple,arxl told the facts.    We hate being humbugged, we are very suspicious, we have been constantly deceived and ill-treated as we think by England, and we believe that if you were to adopt thia policy of abandoningHome
Home Rule in face of the apathy of resistance of the Irish that you would be deceiving us again, it would be said that you had never intended to carry Home Rule, that you had only sought to humbug us by attaching it to Conscrip-tion, and throughout the &quot;length and breadth of the land you would arouse a feeling of intense bitterness among our people      while at the same time by bringing in your Home Rule measure and bo burning your boats you will alienate all Unionist sympathy and support in the country.&quot;1 believe this to be an accurate description of the situation and for these reasons I hold that the policy of the Irish Government is the only way by which the objects the Government have in view can be attained for the present, and that as regards the future, we must wait upon events, and hope that if the Administration of the new Government in Ireland&apos;is as successful as most of us believe it will be, a condition of things may arise in which it may be possible to deal with other proposals&apos; and to bring about a real im-provement in Iceland.    For the present ,tima is of vital con-sequence, and I venture to express the earnest hope that the Government will not enquire in too much detail into the action of the Iricih Government0  This means delay, it means that the Irish Government are hampered and they cannot be blamed if they say that when they.are trying to do what they feel certain to be the right thing, and when they are all agreed on the other side of StoGoorge&apos;s Channel, the English Government here, not possessed of all the facts, not having the accurate and detailed knowledge which is at the disposal of the Irish Government, interfere and thereby produce the unfortunateconsequences
consequences which have been too often the result of a want of confidence in the Irish Government by the Government in London. I have willingly and cheerfully undertaken the difficult and rather laborious task of acting as the representative of the Cabinet with the Irish Government, but if every act of the latter is to be discussed and debated in Cabinet,, even when the Irish Government and I are in entire accord, I fear the wheels of the machine will be badly clogged,I believe the combination of Lord French and Mr. Shortt is an admirable-one. The Government of Ireland is being conducted on lines which have never been adopted before.   The Chief Secretary shows courage, determination, coolness, and has already acquired a remarkable  grasp of his work, and the union of the great soldier and the vigorous civilian administra-tor is, I believe, an excellent one,   and for the first time in my life for many; years \s-I am extremely hopeful of the future of the country.  But  everything depends upon the support given to. the Irish Government and their  freedom from undue criticism.,;      . . .  W.H.L,1/6/18. :
