SECRET. G.T.-4761.THE LABOUR SITUATION.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s ^(BUfte&amp;JJj JOlPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1918.12Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 5th June, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The demands of German Labour are described.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour .press on military affairs, on Russia, Ireland, Works Committees, and on food is discussed.Part III: District Reports.In the North-Western area the situation is very unsettled, and in the West Midlands and Scotland not entirely satisfactory; otherwise the country is quiet.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The strike at Messrs. Grayson&apos;s, Garston, referred to in this Report for the 15th and 22nd May has again broken out. That at the Tredegar Collieries in South Wales has been settled.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. A dispute affecting all the moulders in Scotland is in progress, and there is again some fear of trouble at the Vulcan Motor Works, Southport.   Otherwise no serious dispute is in progress.I.-General Remarks.The Demands of German Labour.During the past year organised labour in Germany has three times formulated a programme of reconstruction and of reform in matters affecting Labour. Of these the first was a statement which appeared in &quot; Vorwarts&quot; of the 1st July, 1917, containing a summary of the demands made by trade union organisations generally. The second was a programme of socio-political organisation put forward by the Social Democratic Trade Unions and pulished in &quot; Die Konjunktur &quot; of the 24th January last. The third was the draft of a Bill prepared by the same unions for the constitution of Chambers of Labour.The statement of claims made in July of last&apos;year refers specially to the transition period and covers a wide area. In its forefront is placed a demand for representation of organised labour on the Imperial Commission for transition questions. This Commission has since merged in the Imperial Economic Department, and the demand has been met with practically complete refusal, as on the Advisory Committee for the transition period, which consists of nearly 400 members, only 7 representatives have been allowed from organised, labour.After a suggestion that regulation of the food supply should be continued after the conclusion of peace, the question of Employment Exchanges is dealt with.   It is urged that the system should be regulated by a law applying to the whole Empire, that [1100-32] ^ . . - g
exchanges should be multiplied and be more efficiently managed, and that a central clearing-house should be developed and consolidated, in such a way as to ensure adjustment between supply and demand. Bail way facilities for all men who have to travel to or in search of&apos; employment are called for. In the case of discharged soldiers the memorandum calls upon the State to enforce the re-employment of all married men with families in the concerns in which they were employed before enlistment, but an Imperial Commission has rejected the principle of compulsion of employers to re-employ discharged soldiers.The Trade Unions also demand State employment for those out of work, one month&apos;s leave on full pay for all demobilised men, and further leave on pay for those for whom treatment is necessary, or who require a rest for purposes of recuperation. Great stress is also laid on a general measure of State Insurance against unemployment, and the enactment of other regulations of the usual kind for the protection of labour are demanded, such as, for instance, the prohibition of night work in oakeries ; 7 o&apos;clock closing time for shops ; reduction of the hours of work ; and special conditions for the welfare of women. It is not clear that these demands have as yet been considered in detail, with the exception of that for the re-employment of married men discharged from the army, but it is probable that the constitution of the Imperial Economic Department-has some connection with them, and doubtless they will engage its attention.The second definite statement of the trade unions consists of a long and considered memorandum on social and economic policy, and, incidentally, this indicates the fears at present in the minds of the workpeople. Provision is made in that programme for an Imperial Ministry of Labour, together with an Imperial Labour Office, consisting of (1) a Board to be constituted in equal proportions of representatives of the Government, representatives of employers, and representatives of workpeople; and (2) an Advisory Council consisting of representatives of employers and workpeople. Provincial offices for each city or province, and local labour offices for each town or rural district, are part of the scheme. A Labour Ministry has now been provided in the Imperial Economic Department, but its constitution differs very largely from that anticipated in the programme.. The demand for labour chambers has already been referred to in this Boport for the 15th May, and the difference between the system claimed by the trade unions and that actually formulated was there indicated.The Memorandum goes on to insist on the right of combination and strike, and particularly cancellation of the prohibition of combination among railway servants, Government workmen, seamen, agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and workmen of foreign extraction.It next demands the recognition of collective agreements and the statutory establishment of Conciliation Boards Imperial, Federal, and Provincial consisting in equal numbers of representatives of employers and workpeople ; it lays stress on the necessity for the codification of Labour laws, for the protection of Labour by legislation, for the insurance of all workpeople. It requires the regulation of Labour Exchanges by Imperial statute, private employment exchanges being prohibited.With regard to trade union affairs the statement claims the abolition of all statutory and administrative obstacles to the organisation of workpeople, and favours the compilation of statistics of all trade union activities for the whole Empire.One of the most remarkable sections of the Memorandum deals with international social policy. It is there suggested that Germans working abroad should obtain the greatest possible share of the benefits of Socialist labour legislation, while foreigners working in Germany should be placed on an equality with German subjects. These objects, it suggests, could&apos;be reached by means of international treaties for the regulation of labour legislation in every country by agreement. Should the proposals of the Memorandum be generally accepted, a universal eight hours&apos; day, universal enforcement of prohibition of employment of children under 15 years of age, universal prohibition of night-work and of the employment of women and young persons in dangerous occupations and in underground mines would result. The Memorandum then proceeds to deal with various other matters which are not strictly industrial in character, including public food supply, national education, provision of dwellings, and public health.A large portion of the demands made by organised Labour in these two memoranda will not be accepted by the Government or the employers. Doubtless more was demanded than Labour expected to obtain, but there can be little doubt that the standard of wages enjoyed by the working classes in Germany during the war renders a peaceful reversion to the inferior pre-war conditions exceedingly improbable. The provision made by the Government in the creation of the Imperial Economic Department
and the drafting of the Labour Chambers Bill does not appear to meet the legitimate requirements of the case, and it will be interesting to follow the developments which may be expected during and after the transition period.II. Peess &apos; Comments.Military Affairs.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; has an interesting article on the success of the German offensive. It suggests that the explanation lies in two advantages which the Germans have possessed interior lines and the opportunity for the intensive training of troops.It is probably true that the feats of the attackers on May 27th to 29th, as on March 21st to 23rd, could have been performed by no army but the German, and by very few divisions in that army except those which performed them. The demonstration amounts to a discovery, and all future generalship will take account of it.The Labour Press contains some comments on the bombing of hospitals. The &quot; Herald,&quot; denouncing the latest outrage, grieves that no words can adequately describe the horror of such proceedings or condemn too strongly the persons responsible for such infamies. If it is true that the German airman who bombed the hospital is a prisoner in our hands he should be put on his trial for murder with a jury selected from the British air service at the front to investigate the case and award punishment. In the &quot; Call &quot; is a lamentation on the unutterable foulness of war. Far from ennobling the human race, war degrades it. The lust to kill becomes the ruling passion ; the man gives place to the savage. How else can we describe the bombing of hospitals in Prance by German airmen than as acts of savages ?   The whole war is inhuman.Russia. ,The Labour Press, as usual, demands the recognition by the British Government of the Bolsheviks, and deprecates any armed intervention in either Prussia or Siberia. The &quot;Call&quot; asserts that, liaving successfully protected.Greece, the Allied Powers are planning the protection of Russia. According to recent assurances from high quarters, the protection is to be an entirely benevolent one, and is to be exercised in Russia&apos;s own interests. Russians, however, are looking rather askance at this proffered hand of protection, and all they wish is to be left alone. It is, moreover, possibly that the Germans, on seeing the efforts of the Allies to divert to themselves pare of the hatred which at present attaches, may think it wiser to make the Allies a present of the whole of that hatred by a change of attitude towards Russia.The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; agrees with the article by Mr. Ransome in the &quot; Daily News &quot; on Russian affairs. If there were any statesmanship left in the Government of the Allies Mr. Ransome:s account of the division of opinion in Russia would be a call to the allied Governments to take immediate action in the direction qf supporting the Soviet authority. The revolutionaries are the only definite anti-German party in Russia, and the privileged classes are looking more and more to Germany to save them from the masses. The relations between Russia and the Allies have recently become worse, and the threats of the occupation of Siberia are very greatly to be regretted in the interests of both parties. A different view is taken by the &quot;Clarion.&quot; Referring to criticisms like those quoted above, the writer expresses great doubts as to what more the Allies could have done to help the country. The only help the Russians wanted was imitation of their pacifist action. Look at the condition of Russia to-day chaos, anarchy, bloodshed, invasion, tyranny, and the Bolsheviks now pleading to the Allies for help against the German scourge. The only way in which Russia and its various republics can be helped appreciably is by smashing the Germans on the Western front.The &quot;Labour Leader.&quot; discussing the convention between China and Japan, thinks that the published version is&quot; neither full nor accurate. The declared purpose is to secure co-operation between Japan and China for the purpose of repelling German aggression in Siberia. The real purpose is to extend Japanese control over China and utilise that great Empire for purposes of assisting the Imperialist aims of Japan. It is not probable that Japan has a$ff immediate intention of invading Siberia. Its aim is the subjugation of China.
Ireland.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is still sceptical of the evidence for a Sinn Fein plot. Attacks on the Government in the Labour press are, however, less strong and there is even a certain support for its action. Mr. Nevinson writes on Dublin in the &quot; Herald.&quot; Ireland will trust nothing but herself; she will act for herself alone and will recognise Whitehall^ ordinance only by resistance. During the war the successive errors of the Government have multiplied the Sinn Fein followers, who continue to increase. Only in Liberty Hall is to be found a force which, though at present supplementing Sinn Fein, may absorb and surpass it. There the wrorkers cany forward the wide and ennobling purposes of James Connolly. Most papers consider the accounts of the evidence against Sinn Fein leaders are insufficient. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; compares the statement to that made in regard to the Maurice incident. If will fail to carry conviction to an impartial or judicial-minded person. If the charges have any foundation it is the duty of Government to bring the persons against whom these charges have been made to trial. The &quot; Call&quot; is even more contemptuous and describes the statement as an ex yarte production, worth no more than the paper on which it is written. The &quot; Clarion &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot; take a more moderate view. The former upholds the arrest of the Sinn Fein leaders by saying that Government wants to avert bloodshed. It accepts the view that Government holds positive proof of the planning of a rebellion to break out in the month of June. That rebellion must have been futile. Similnrly, the arrested men are not brought to trial through the anxiety to prevent bloodshed. An Irish jury would not convict; a British jury&apos;s verdict would be received by the rebels in Ireland with derision; and shooting the prisoners would merely swell the roll of martyrs and intensify hatred. Informers, who have always abounded in Irish conspiracy, would be murdered within a short time, &quot;Justice&apos;&apos;&apos; also accepts the view ,that a. German invasion would have been welcomed by some of the Sinn Feiners, though it thinks the statement of evidence could have been made more telling than it was. It warns Sinn Feiners that Great Britain cannot be intimidated.Works Committees.Criticism of the Admiralty scheme for dockyards is repeated in the &quot;Herald.&quot; A more elaborate article appears in the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; which reviews the report by the Ministry of Labour on works committees. After explaining the system of wrorks committees, and district and national councils recommended in the Whitley Eeport, it asserts that progress has not been rapid, and surmises that the new constitution is not going to be very widely accepted. The greatest blame, however, attaches to Government, the largest employer in the kingdom, which, in spite of the efforts of the Ministry of Labour, has refused to inaugurate in its own establishments .the constitution it is pressing others to adopt. The Post Office is peculiarly suitable, and experiments are possible in the establishments under the Commissioner of Works,, the Stationery Office, the Minister of Munitions, railways, and the mining industry in view of the Coal Controller^ powers. In particular, the new dockyard scheme is seriously at variance with the Whitley constitution and of sinister omen. Yard committees correspond neither to the proposed works committees nor to district councils, and should not deal with rates of wages or hours of labour. This new scheme ignores employers&apos; associations and rules out trade unionism. It resembles the employers&apos; schemes framed in Scotland. The yard committees are a grave political danger.In the trade journals the Whitley scheme is generally approved or at any rate recommended for fair trial. Thus the &quot; Journeymen Bakers&apos; Magazine&quot; presses strongly for favourable consideration, and specially notes the recognition of trade unions. The &quot;Gas World&quot; reports a meeting of the Manchester District Institute of Gas Engineers, at which further examination was left to the council. The &quot; Engineer &quot; approves of works committees properly constituted, and regrets the Admiralty scheme for its failure to co-operate with the &quot;unions. It adds that the Ministry of LabouFs report lays too much stress on the influence of shop stewards, and says that the evidence shows that these work in defiance of the unions. The writer is not prepared to deny the benefit of decentralisation, but employers demand a clear statement whether they are to deal with the union officials or with shop stewards.The &quot; Shipbuilding and Shipping Eecord &quot; and the &quot; Journal of Decorative Art &apos;r approve of the efforts of the Committee on Production. In analysing reasons for success, the former says the Committee has ability to appreciate technical points and has been sound on matters of principle, though inclined to split differences on wages.
It suggests the setting up of similar Committees for the Shipbuilding and Engineering Industries after the war. The latter, dealing with painters, points to the necessity of a national settlement of real wages, and hopes that the work of the Committee will help to cause a semblance of order in this problem, where chaos exists at present.Agitation in favour of Mooney, who was convicted at San Francisco, is continued in the &quot; Herald,&quot; which publishes further accounts of his trial. &quot;Justice &quot; aud the &quot; Call&quot; repeat the plea for mercy in favour of McLean. While not justifying his offence, these papers fear that his health will suffer.Food.Mr. Carmichael, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; deals with the Smitfrfield Meat Control Board and the simplification of the wholesale distribution of meat. He thinks that if a number of wholesale firms are closed hardships will be done to men who have been with firms for many years and are receiving good salaries. This will lead to a loss of trade union rates of wages.Mr. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot; has little but praise for the work of the Ministry of Food. He approves entirely of the proposal to bring the whole milk, supply of London under the control of the Ministry, so long as great milk combines do not impose too great a price on the community. In regard to cheese he says the fact is that adequate supplies are not available, and cannot be brought from abroad till some time in June. He disbelieves the scientific opinion that bread as now made is sufficiently nourishing. He praises the Food Ministry for pushing the question of labour and co-operative repre-sentation on all local food councils.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Very little unrest is reported in the area, and this is chiefly of a trivial and unimportant nature.At the Fitters&apos; National Gauge Factory dissatisfaction prevails owing to the shortening of the hours and the discontinuance of a night-shift, which involve a considerable loss of wages. The men are losing half-days at intervals, in order to show their disapproval.An apprentice of high technical qualifications in the Royal Gun Factory is said to have been drafted into the Guards, though his release was granted only to enable him to enable him to join the R.A.F. Both the Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factory and the shop stewards are taking this case up.A meeting was held at Woolwich on the 30th to hear the report of the deputation upon dilution which has visited Parkhead, Dalmuir, York, and Elswick. It was agreed that dilution must in future be accepted in the Royal Gun Factory. The report upon conditions in the North, however, caused considerable indignation at the meeting, and some speakers suggested that trade unionism there was absolutely dead.A protest was recently made at a meeting of Woolwich workers against the nomination of a pacifist, A. G. Cameron, as Labour candidate for West Woolwich, and the association of his name with that of Mr. Will Crooks.At a conference held in London, attended by representatives of twenty-two Jewish Trade Unions and labour organisations, it was decided to form a Jewish National Labour Council of Great Britain. It is proposed to establish intimate relations with the British Labour Party, as a Jewish section.West Midlands.Conditions in this district still remain unsettled, and numerous small strikes are reported.Unrest still continues to prevail at the Austin Works, Birmingham, where a renewal of the strike was threatened, owing to an alleged case of victimisation. Although it is hoped that this has been averted, the workers show keen dissatis-faction with the management of Sir Herbert Austin, and state that they consider him a hindrance to the output of munitions.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The situation in this area still remains very satisfactory, and few reports of unrest Lave been received.[1100-32] C
The visit of the King and Queen to the industrial centres of Yorkshire has given great satisfaction, and has resulted in demonstrations of loyalty on the part of the workers.Some unrest has occurred among the Leicester tramway employees owing to the proposed appointment of five women inspectors to take the place of men, as it is con-tended that plenty of men are available.&apos; William Gallacher is making efforts to stir up agitation in Sheffield, where he spoke at the A.S.E. Institute on the 24th May. His speech criticised on the usual lines the higher command in France, and he held that peace might have been secured in 1917 but for the action of capitalists. He concluded with a strong protest against the arrest of John McLean.NorlhWestern.The situation in this area still remains very unsettled, though work has been resumed at Messrs. Cammell Laird&apos;s, Birkenhead.A violent dissension has arisen in Liverpool between the Tramway and Vehicle Workers&apos; Association and the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, which held opposition meetings on the 2nd. Only about 150 attended the meeting of the former, at which the principles of the union were described and reference made to the benefits which it had procured for the workers. At the meeting of the latter, at which as many as 1,500 were present, it was stated that the tramway and vehicle workers were backed in their opposition by the Liverpool Tramway Committee. It appears that the M.E.A. is recognised by the Welsh and Scottish, though not as yet by the English, Trades Congress, while it caters for all municipal employees in opposition to the Tramway and Vehicle Workers&apos; Union, which covers only tramwaymen and women. The aim of the M.E.A. was stated at the meeting to be the prevention of sectionalism in the Liverpool Trade Union movement.The strike at Messrs. GraysoiVs, Garston, mentioned in Part IV of this report for the loth and 22nd May, has again broken out.At the meeting of the Shop Stewards&apos; Eeconstruction Committee on the 28th May, the disputes at Messrs. Grayson&apos;s Works and at Messrs. CammellLaird&apos;s came up for discussion among other subjects. In the former case no pledge of support was given until the facts had been submitted to all the shops in the district, while, as to the latter, it was determined that no support should be given to either side in the case of demarcation disputes.The question of pacifism has once more been to the fore in this district, and a meeting of about 300 conscientious objectors has been held in Liverpool. The tone of the meeting was moderate, though it carried a resolution protesting against the. victimisation of conscientious objectors and endorsing the appointment of a committee of members from various pacifist societies to protect them against such treatment.The Women&apos;s Peace Crusade met at Liverpool on the 3rd, but the attendance was small. The proposed public demonstration was postponed, but arrangements were made for the distribution throughout the district of leaflets entitled &quot; Peace by Negotiation.&quot;Northern.The situation in this area seems on the whole to be satisfactory. There is, how-ever, a considerable degree of discontent prevailing among boilermakers owing to the non-payment of a promised advance in wages. An agreement was reached in February last for an advance to men engaged on repair work, but this has not yet been ratified by the Government. A mass meeting was to be held on the 3rd to discuss the situation, and fears of a strike are expressed if further delay occurs.South Wales.Some improvement is manifest in this district, and with the settlement of the dispute at the Tredegar Collieries, little active unrest exists and the general situation seems to be satisfactory.Scotland.The situation in this area is more unsettled, and at Ayr, in particular, numerous disputes are in progress, the most important being one among the bakers which is dealt with in Part IV.
In Glasgow conditions are at present very quiet and at the C.W.C. meeting on the 1st only six delegates were present. A. statement was made that four shop stewards had been dismissed for carrying on C.W.C. propaganda, but it was agreed that it would be useless at present to try to arouse agitation for their reinstatement.A demonstration under the auspices of the Clyde District Defence Propaganda Committee was held on Glasgow Green on the 2nd at which about 2,000 people were present. Various well-known agitators supported a resolution calling upon the Government to release all persons in custody for offences under D.O. R.A. in connection with speeches ; no very great enthusiasm was, however, displayed by the audienge.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation is on the whole decidedly more disturbed than last week, and a larger number of disputes is reported.The Shipyard Labour Department reports seven new stoppages of work involving in all about 2,700 men. Thirteen old cases were still remaining from previous weeks, and of this total work has been resumed in nineteen cases.Messrs. Barclay, Curie, and Co., Glasgow, are again involved in a small strike of about forty apprentice riveters, who ceased work owing to a dispute regarding wages. The matter has been referred to the Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding.At Messra. Armstrong, Whitworth. and Co., Newcastle, 250 squads of riveters ceased work on the 27th May in connection with the demand for a 35 per cent, increase. The case was heard by the Committee on Production on the 2ird, but the men had become restless owing to lack of information as to the position of the negotiations. Work was resumed on the 31st and the discontent is now apparently at an, end.The demarcation contest at Messrs. Cammell, Laird, and Co., Liverpool, ended on the 30th May, after a conference at which the firm agreed that the work in dispute should be accepted as boilermakers&apos; work.At Messrs. Grayson&apos;s, Garston, a second strike of about 1,600 men lias occurred owing to the retention of Rennison, a head lime-keeper, who refuses to join a union. In this he is supported by the firm on the ground that his pay exceeds 200/. He is very unpopular, and on the 3rd June the rest of Messrs. Grayson&apos;s employees came out as a protest against working with him. The men refuse to arbitrate, which was suggested by the Industrial Commissioner, unless an arbitrator is,agreed upon by both sides. No certain prospect of a settlement is indicated, but, according to the latest information, the representative of the Ministry of Labour, who has gone to the works, has arranged a conference between the parties.The Ministry of Munitions reports 10,238 men involved in strikes for the week ending 29th May.- In consequence of a demand for the 12-  per cent, bonus, a number of plumbers in the Scottish chemical trades struck on the 23rd May. The men resumed work pending negotiations and the case has now been referred to the Chief Industrial Commissioner.The War Office Contracts Department has two new stoppages of work to report.A short strike occurred at Messrs. Light and Co.&apos;s, Peckham, owing to an alleged reduction by the firm in the piece rates paid for machining khaki drill frocks. The firm received a further continuity contract for these articles, and reduced the rate. The workers are suspicious that some of the old contract work is included, and are dissatisfied with the whole attitude of the firm as regards the rate.The second strike mentioned, which was short and unimportant, involved only thirty girls.The Coal Controller reports twenty-seven new stoppages. Work has, however, been resumed in twenty-four of these, cases.After involving a total of 50,000 men, the&apos; strike at the Tredegar Collieries ceased on the 31st May, upon a settlement which seems to constitute a victory for the unofficial Reform Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation, as the amount of wages which had been stopped was paid, and the conference with the Combine Committee was held, before the actual resumption of work. There was a general resumption of work throughout the coalfield on the 1st June, with the exception of the Ebbw Vale steel workers, who remained out until the 3rd June.Two stoppages have occurred in Yorkshire on account of the exemption as indispensable of men in the electrical departments; the men&apos;s action is not, however, supported by the association.
(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 34 new and 101 old controversial cases, 41 of which have now been settled.At Scottfs Shipbuilding Company, Glasgow, the platers have refused to work overtime ; this also involves the helpers, though the latter are willing to do the additional work.   Investigations are now being made by the local Shipyard Labour Department.All moulders throughout Scotland are threatening to strike unless their demand for time and a half for overtime and double time for Sunday work is conceded. The employers are willing to allow the claim, but only after a full week has been worked.The Ministry of Munitions reports that there is again some fear of a strike at the Vulcan Motor Works, Southport, where the men, though aircraft workers, are claiming the increase of 2d. an hour in the building rate.*The discontent at the National Ordnance Factory, Hunslet, seems to have subsided; the shop foreman, over whom the dispute arose, having obtained a Government appointment with which he has expressed complete satisfaction.The War Office Contracts Department has two new controversial cases to report.The Scottish Ironmoulders&apos; Association recently made an application to the Employers&apos; Federation that the time worked oach day should be counted separately for the calculation of overtime earnings. The employers rejected this application, and the men threatened to refuse to work overtime. The Federation has been advised to refer the matter to arbitral ion.Considerable unrest is apparent in Dewsbury owing to the non-payment of the recent &apos; advance in war bonus to local textile workers.There seems also to be some prospect of a strike among the curriers in Scotland, in consequence of a demand for 4&apos;/. an hour increase. The Union has notified the Employers&apos; Association of its decision to call out the men upon the expiration of their notices, unless a decision is reached.The Coal Controller has only two new controversial cases to note, but these appear to be unimportant, and no details are given.The bakers&apos; dispute at Ayr seems to be still unsettled; the men demand an increase Of 14*. a week, which the employers fully admit to be reasonable. They maintain, how-ever, that they cannot afford to pay this advance, unless Government will consent to raise the price of the 2-lb. loaf by a farthing or reduce that of flour by 5s. a bag. The master baker.0 decided to warn the public that no bread would be on sale on the 4th June and after unless a settlement was reached.The Committee on Production has heard forty-one cases in London during the week.These included applications for the 12^- per cent, bonus by ammunition box makers, asphalters, and some of the Cunard Steamship Company&apos;s employees, and one for a substantial advance by the stuff and woollen warehousemen of Bradford.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 155 differences for the week ending 1st June, thirty-two of which are claims for the 12^- per cent, bonus. The greater number continue to fall in the engineering, shipbuilding, and metal group.G. H. EGBERTS.
