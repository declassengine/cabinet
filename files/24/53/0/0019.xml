Ctrl - *IThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]65Printed for the War Cabinet. May 1918.SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 53. Week ended 25th May, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS. Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight and in the approaches to the Thames. North Sea.On 23rd May the armed merchant cruiser &quot; Moldavia &quot; was torpedoed and sunk 14 English miles from Newhaven.   The vessel was carrying United States troops of whom 56 have Channel, been lost.  No casualties occurred among the crew, and 435 naval ratings and 415 United States troops were picked up by the destroyers &quot; Scourge &quot; and &quot; Grasshopper&quot; and landed at Dover.In addition to the anti-submarine operations carried out by aircraft in different areas, FUnderi R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, employed on Naval duty, have carried out a number of area-patrols and reconnaissances.During the night of 18th-19th May three 550-lb. and twenty-eight 112-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge.On 19th May twelve 230-lb. bombs were dropped in the Zeebrugge warehouseon the Mole being set on fire and one enemy machine was brought down in flames.On 20th May twenty-one 230-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge and vicinity, a direct hit being obtained on an enemy destroyer, which however, proceeding very slowly, was able to reach port. One direct hit on the seaplane base was also observed and three enemy machines were driven down out of control.On the night of 20th-21st May three 550-lb. and fourteen 112-lb. bombs were dropped on St. Denis Westrem aerodrome.On 21st May six 230-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge, a direct hit being obtained on an enemy destroyer in the fairway. A later reconnaissance showed that this destroyer had sunk.On 22nd May ten 230-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge and fourteen 112-lb. bombs on Thourout.During the night of 22nd-23rd May over 2 tons of bombs were dropped on Bruges Docks.On 25th May eight 230-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge and six 230-lb. bombs on Mariakerke.  It was noticed that there was very little activity around the block ships.Except on the 19th May, when one of our machines was missing, all of our machines employed in the foregoing operations returned safely to their base.Two survivors from the special service vessel &quot; Bombala,&quot; the presumed loss of which Atlantic, was reported in the Naval Weekly Appreciation for the week ended 4th May, 1918, have arrived at Dakar.   They confirm the loss of the vessel, and that she was in action with two submarines on 25th April.On 21st May four Allied machines carried out a raid on Cattaro, and one ton of bombs Mediter-was dropped on the seaplane base, submarine station and arsenal.  Direct hits were ranean. observed on the submarine headquarters, which were set on fire, on barracks and on arsenal buildings.  All machines returned safely, one, however, having been badly damaged by gunfire.(C1181) Wt.     55   5/18  H&amp;S
ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines During the week..under review.about 15 large enemy submarines have been located, operating. ^wo Demg vessels of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type, one of which was homeward bound, and is now probably of! the Faroe Islands and the other somewhere off the North American coast. The remaining large boats were chiefly operating in the entrance of the&apos; English Channel and the southern approaches to the Irish Sea. Enemy submarines on passage are now taking the route round the North of Shetland, doubtless on account of the hunting to which those using the Fair Island Channel have been subjected and to the greater concentration of the Northern Barrage force.

Submarines possibly sunk are not included. .....* One of these was sunk by a French Armed Trawler, and the one interned in Spain had sustained damage inflicted by French aircraft and not British, as stated in last week&apos;s Appreciation.The two &quot; Results &quot; achieved during the week under review are a submarine of the U.B. Class, which was torpedoed by Submarine H. 4 about 38 miles south of Cattaro, and &quot; U.C. 56,&quot; which entered the port of Santarider and was interned after having been damaged ofi the Loire by depth charges dropped by the-U.S. Armed Yacht &quot; Christabel.&quot;The number of actions specified in the above Table for the week ended May 25th includes actions in Foreign Waters, whereas for the three previous weeks the figures relate only to actions in Home Waters. It is proposed, in future, to include each week actions with enemy submarines which are reported both in Home and in Foreign Waters.MERCANTILE LOSSES BY ENEMY ACTION.The following is a Comparative Statement of the Number and Tonnage of all Merchant Vessels sunk in recent weeks by enemy action : 	British Vessels.

The losses during the week under review, both of British and Allied and Neutral vessels, are the lowest recorded in any week since the commencement of unrestricted ....;/] submarine warfare, the smallest total of losses in any previous week being 27,410 tons (17,105 tons of which were British) in the week ended 19th January last. Although the figures this week are more satisfactory, it must not be expected that they can be maintained at this low level.The Table in Appendix 1 shows the numbers and tpnnage of sailings and of losses Losses of by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings, of British merchant steamships P/^1,. of over 500 tons gross register, and the Table in Appendix Ia gives similar information as, in Traded regards all merchant ships, both British and Foreign.   The Table in Appendix II is a summary of the percentages of losses to sailings of British ships for the last six weeks.The tonnage of British vessels engaged in United Kingdom trades which arrived at or left United Kingdom ports during the week under review shows a further slight reduction, but no such vessels engaged in Overseas trades were lost during the week, and only one ! was lost in Cross-Channel and in Coasting trades respectively. The percentage of losses to sailings as regards all United Kingdom trades was last week only .09 as against .71 the previous week, and .19 in the week ended 19th January, which was, hitherto, the lowest percentage recorded since these Tables have been prepared.It is proposed in future Naval Weekly Appreciations to discontinue the Table given in Appendix I, which relates to British ships alone, and to substitute therefor the Table which is this week set forth in Appendix Ia giving similar particulars as regards all merchant steamships, both British and Foreign, of over 500 tons gross. It is necessary that the various aspects of the submarine problem, particularly as regards losses, should be considered from the point of view of World tonnage rather than British tonnage alone.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by in which enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.Enemy activity on the ocean routes is much reduced this week, and on the East Coast no attack whatever has been reported, but the activity in the English Channel shows some increase from the low level recorded for the previous week.The number of British and Foreign Merchant Vessels sailing in organised convoy, Vessels which have completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such convoyej. convoys, compared with the corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows : 	Weekly average,		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		April, 1918.		llth May.		18th May. &apos;		25th May.

This is explained by the fact that the Table on page 2 deals with losses which actually occur during each week, whereas losses in convoy are not included in the above table until the convoy reaches its destination, when the losses during the whole period of convoy are entered.fC 1181) 1.1
ENEMY MINES.Minelaying, During the week under review mines have been laid by the enemy of! Berwick-upon-Tweed, in the approaches to the River Humber and in the Lowestoft and Harwich areas.The Humber approaches have not been mined during the last 18 months, and the mines which have now been laid in that area are probably directed against our mining operations in the Heligoland Bight the Humber being the principal base for minelayers engaged in those operations and against the Humber portion of the Scandinavian convoys.It is anticipated that further mines will be found of! the Humber, in order to account for the total number of mines usually carried by a submarine which uses the delayed releasing system.In the Lowestoft and Harwich areas no less than three focal points were mined during the week.Casualties. The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.	Number of Enemy Mines Destroyed.

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.A force of about 600 infantry with field guns and machine guns, and engineer details has been sent to Murmansk under the command of General Poole, and should by this time have arrived. General Poole is to command all military forces ashore both at Murmansk and Archangel, and his special duty will be to organise the Czech, Serbian and other units which are reported to be in those localities. The River Dwina at Archangel is now clear of ice, so that ships can approach that harbour safely.Owing to the recent activities of German submarines in the Arctic, the President of the Murmansk Committee has asked the Central Authorities for permission to organise defensive forces against enemy submarines.Commander Pilotski is being sent to Berlin as head of a Naval Mission to discuss Naval details of the peace terms and to demand information as to German intentions regarding the Russian Fleet.Arrangements have been made for the Japanese to supply any reinforcements which may be necessary at Vladivostock, in order to prevent the removal of stores by the Bolsheviks.Spain.A German submarine, reported to be &quot; U.C.&quot; 56,&quot; entered the port of Santander on 24th May, having been forced to take refuge owing to machinery defects, which rendered her unable to dive.  The vessel has been interned by the Spanish authorities.There are now four German submarines interned in Spanish ports. The Spanish Government state that the report that one of these submarines attempted to escape from Ferrol on 21st May is incorrect.Naval Staff,30th May, 1918.
