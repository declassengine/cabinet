Colonel 1, Dally ImiJty&apos;s Covei70SECRET.MINISTEY   OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, May 29, 1918.Jf-ySZj    7^&apos;        PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.Allied Requirements.--Mr. Hoover, who expects to visit England in July in order to have consultations on the whole food programme with, the various Allies, has cabled to Mr. Sheldon as follows : &quot; Present export of beef from the United States represents about what can be counted on; it can be continued and gradually somewhat increased as freezer facilities enlarge; it would not embarrass our problems if beef export were somewhat decreased but we do not desire it and should be kept informed in advance.   Pork situation is very different; stocks are large and prospects of increased production good.   Necessary in order to hold this favourable situation that we have steady and large orders particularly in fall and -winter months.   Appreciably lower prices for beef or pork are inconsistent with our promises to farmers and with continuation production on present scale ; on general question we are clear that we must insist that on account of our production situation United States meat exports should continue to be largely pork.   Tentative pork programme, 10,000 tons British army, 15,000 British civilian, and perhaps 15,000 French and Italian civilian, is small but would not embarrass us for summer months, but prefer your suggestion of 50,000 tons monthly, but by fall desirable that very much heavier pork orders be made, which we should like to see at about 100,000 tons monthly for all Allied requirements.   Any part of this may be frozen or mild cure if refrigeration available.   United States packers can continue storage of accumulated pork on this side if regular programme assured.&quot;In this connection Sir Guy Granet has been asked to inform Mr. Hoover that all possible measures will be taken to reduce the demand for imported meat in the United Kingdom and to substitute therefor hog products. It is anticipated that the total military and civil frozen meat Allied demands on North America will not exceed 32,000 tons a month, and will probably be considerably less. This will provide for a meat ration of 20 ounces per capita per Aveek after July 15th. Sir Guy Granet has also been informed that the total weekly shipment of bacon and hams should be about 20,000 net tons to the end of June, half to be delivered at Liverpool, and the other half at London and other ports.The Meats and Fats Executive have suggested to Sir Guy Granet that the . specification and conditions of contracts for British, French, and Italian purchases in the United States should be identical, and that the arrangements made for the inspection of frozen beef purchased on British account should also be available to the other Allies.Sir Guy Granet cables that considerable difficulty has arisen in the transport of hams, bacon, and lard to seaboard, owing to the inability of the American railways to provide for the re-icing of cars; in consequence the existing contracts with packers as to guarantee, inspection, and mode of delivery have had to be amended, but that urgent efforts are being made for reconsideration by the railways of this matter.As a result of conferences between the Admiralty, the Ministry of Shipping, the Wheat Executive, the Commission for Relief in Belgium, and the Ministry of Food, the Prime Minister has cabled to Mr. Hoover, in his capacity as Chairman of the Relief Commission, stating that the British Government are willing to provide one half the tonnage necessary to make up the monthly shortages of the Commission for Relief, and expressing his gratification that the United States Government have agreed to take responsibility for the other half.a   (83)5683-5   Pk 1   130. 0/18   E k S AControl of Supplies.
9-IBacon, Bams, and Lftrfi.--DifHcuIties in distribution are still experienced owing to the very heavy arrivals at Liverpool and Glasgow, and the shortage in London and the South of England. The week lias, however, shown a considerable diminution in the congestion on the quays, which had for some time been causing anxiety.Final meetings have been held with representatives of the trade on the 24th May, in connection with the proposed Order fixing definite maximum retail prices for the principal&apos;cuts. The proposals embodied in the draft Order were generally approved by the wholesalers with tho exception of the provisions on the relationship between the primary and secondary wholesaler. The representatives of the retailers held that the prices were for the most part satisfactory, though the retail profit on lard was criticised as insufficient. ,Butter. A purchase of 165 tons of butter at 43^ to 44 cents per lb., f.a.s., in New York, has been made. During the week ending 25th May 4,129 tons of butter arrived, in this country, the stocks in hand being 13,854 tons, and the quantity on passage 13,830 tons. On 27th May the usual fortnightly distribution was j made ; on this occasion the amount issued was 4,050 tons.Cheese. Advice has been received of a further shipment of 1,656 tons of cheese from New Zealand and 219 tons from Canada ; 8,807 tons are now on the way from New Zealand, 1,109 tons from Australia, 1,134 tons from Canada, and 1,105 tons from the United States of America, where 5,972 tons of stock remain unshipped ; 1,155 tons of Australian and 1,472 tons of American cheese have arrived in this country.The British&quot;Cheese (Requisition) Order, 1918, dated 29thMay, 1918, provides that British-made whole milk cheese manufactured in Great Britain on or after June 1st, shall be placed at the disposal of the Pood Controller. The Order does not apply to Caerphilly, Wensleydale, Stilton, or soft cheese, or to any cheese made - by a person who normally manufactures less than 56 lbs. per week.Cocoa. In consultation with the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Shipping, arrangements have been made for the shipment of 16,000 tons of raw cocoa at the rate of 4,000 tons a mouth during June, July, August, and September. 15,000 tons will be allocated to British West Africa, and 1,000 tons to British West Indies;The Cocoa Butter (Requisition) Order, .1918, dated 21st May 1918, provides that the occupier of every factory or workshop engaged in the production of cocoa butter from the cocoa bean shall place at the disposal of the Food Controller the whole of the cocoa butter which he has in stock on June 29, or which is produced after that date.   The Order also provides for the taking oyer of imported cocoa butter.Coffee.-The Advisory Committee having reported that the stocks immediately available for the home market have dropped to five months&apos; supply, and that it is necessary to keep three months&apos; supply in bonded warehouse in order to facilitate trading, the alternatives of requisitioning foreign holdings (8,000 tons) and the Admiralty Marshall stock (40,000 tons), or allowing fresh&apos; imports, are being examined.Dried Fruits. The scheme of general distribution has now been worked out and will be put into operation as soon as the currants ship which arrived at Bristol last week has discharged her cargo. It will follow the same general lines as the Persian date distribution, which the trade reports to have worked satisfactorily.Importers are now settling down to work under the new conditions which have succeeded the Dried Fruits (Restriction) Order. There was some grumbling at first at the lowness of prices, but now it is reported from Greece that a ship is being loaded at Patras with 4,000 tons of currants. A shipment of South African raisins is on the way, and contracts for the shipment of Spanish raisins and Indian sultanas have also been reported. A consignment of mixed fruits has been shipped from Australia.Meat. Large consignments of frozen meat continue to arrive from North America, and as the cold stores are full to congestion it is necessary to expedite its disposal. Concessions have to be made to the retailers to induce them to take this meat; this will cause a certain loss to the Ministry of Food, but it is hoped.to recover a considerable amount of it from the shippers in North America.The situation is being greatly eased by the marked decrease in the number of live stock coming into the;markets; for instance, in the Birmingham area-home-grown stock recently provided 95 per cent, of the meat consumed, but this week the entire supply will consist of frozen meat.       &apos;..
The public is now receiving a larger meat ration, taking bacon and meat together, than at any time since the initiation of the scheme; the present scale can be maintained for some time, as, though the supplies of home-grown stock cannot be, accurately foretold, the supplies of imported meat will be fully adequate for some months to come.    -Milk. As a result of inquiries held throughout the country during the past few weeks, as regards the cost of production of milk, some increase in the price of milk appears to be inevitable. The matter will be discussed with representatives of the English and Scottish Boards of Agriculture next Monday.The Use of Milk (Licensing) Order, 1918, dated 21st May 191.8, provides that, on and after June 17, no one shall, except under licence, (1) use any milk, skimmed milk, separated, dried, condensed or butter milk, or any milk preparation in the manufacture for sale of any chocolate, sugar confectionery or other sweetmeats,.or for any other manufacturing purpose except that of articles intended for human con-sumption ; (2) make for sale any condensed or dried milk, milk preparation, butter or cheese (this shall not apply to butter or cheese made on the farm where the milk is produced); (3) sell, or offer for sale as milk, or under any description of which the word milk forms part, any liquid in the making of which dried or condensed milk has been used.Oil and Fats. Purchases of Australian tallow are now proceeding on the basis of allocations made by the ilustralian and New Zealand Governments avhich have been so arranged as to relieve the various meat works; this will facilitate the export of meat to the United Kingdom.The Ministry of Munitions have agreed to hand over the Whale Oil Contract to the Food Controller in order that whale oil- may be used for edible purposes, previous arrangements having been made that the output of glycerine for explosives should not suffer thereby. The whale oil will be bought f.o.b. in the producing countries and allocated on arrival here.At a meeting of the Seed Crushers and Refiners of the United. Kingdom held on 28th May it was decided to form an Association, to enter into direct relation with the Ministry of Food with a view to taking over raw materials and arranging for their allocation and distribution. A Committee of representatives from the chief crushing-centres will be elected immediately to frame the articles of the Association, and the first general meeting of the Asssciation will be held next week. These steps are taken in view of a possible shortage of raw materials in the near future, which would either necessitate short working in all mills and refineries, or the closing down of some among them.Potatoes. Supplies of old potatoes will not be more than adequate till the end of June. Potatoes will have to be imported into Scotland from Ireland, and an Order is being issued prohibiting the movement of Scottish potatoes south of the Tyne, except by license. &apos;.As regards Jersey potatoes, arrangements have been arrived at by the Federation of Wholesale Potato Dealers whereby the retailers are allowed an adequate profit. At present supplies are short, due largely to shipping difficulties. The Jersey crop is now mature, and large supplies may be expected if transport can be provided.The Early Potatoes (Prices) Order, 1918, dated 21st May. 1918, fixes maximum prices for new potatoes from May 20 to July 31. The price is id. per lb. till the end of May, and will be gradually reduced by \d. each half-month to 2d.The Potatoes (Registration of Wholesale Dealers) Order, 1918, dated 22nd May 1918, revokes all certificates granted under the Potatoes Order, 1917, to potato dealers by Food Control Committees. Applications for new certificates of registration in Great Britain are to be made by such persons and in such manner as the Food Controller may direct. &quot;&apos;,Pulping Stations. Premises have been inspected, and negotiations are progressing at Walpole. Cross Keys, Norfolk. It has been found that the existing stations at Newnham-on-Severn and Cheltenham can provide for the fruit district at Dymock. Premises have (been secured and arrangements, for equipment are being carried out at Worcester, ..Barith Bridge, Faversham, Doncaster, Flvesham, Wisbech, Upton-on-Severh, Taddock Wood, Newnham-on-Severn.Rabbits.--5,000 cases (120,000 rabbits) of colonial rabbits were distributed during the week..  This quantity will be increased weekly by 10 to 20 per cent.a 2
Ships&apos; Stor&apos;es.-rVhe Ships&apos; Stores Restriction Order, which came into force in December last, has been copied by the U.S.A. Authorities and the South African Government. The Order has prevented thousands of tons of foodstuffs leaving this country, and many evasions have been detected on the part of neutrals, who still endeavour to take large quantities of foodstuffs out of the country by making false declarations as to their surplus stores remaining on board.On the 14th May the master of the Norwegian ship &quot; Magnhild &quot; was fined 1001 and costs at. Swansea for making a false declaration, that there were no surplus stores on board, with a view of obtaining larger quantities, when in reality he had sufficient on board without coming upon the home markets.; Tea. A new contract has been made with the Indian tea growers, by which this Ministry agrees to take 66 per cent, of the Indian crop in the year ending the 31st May 1919. The terms are substantially the same as those in the former contract.It has been arranged that approved claims for pilferage, loss, or damage in transit of National Control tea, will be met by this Ministry.Organised Distribution.District Reports. In connection with the suggestion put forward in the Third Report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure that the bakers are in some instances allowed an undue margin of profit, it may be noted that the Glasgow Branch of the Operatives Union have demanded as from 15th July an increase in wages of 17. a week together with other conditions, the financial value of which is estimated at 10s. a week or 50 per cent, increase in all. Smaller demands bringing the Ayrshire wage up to the level of the present Glasgow wage have been made upon the master bakers and co-operative bakers of Ayrshire, who have informed the Divisional Com-missioner. that such an increase would leave no working profit whatever. The Costings Department are investigating the figures.The milk retailers of the borough of Saltcoats in Ayrshire were not contented with the maximum retail prices fixed for the summer months by the Local Food Control Committee. The costs were examined by the divisional accountant, who advised that the margin fixed was adequate. The retailers stopped supplies and thereupon the Food Committee took over retail distribution. This is the first instance in Scotland of quasi-municipal distribution, as the Local Authority have supported the Local Food Committee.The Commissioner for the Midlands notes that the feeling amongst a large number of labour representatives whom he has recently met fully approves the general policy of the Ministry as regards labour representation on Local Food Committees.It is reported from the North-Western Division that arrangements are being made for road transport where the congestion on the railways is great. The Commis-sioner points out that a contributing cause of the pressure on the railways is, that transport rates by rail are now lower than those by road, or canal, whereas, before the war, the railway was the most expensive mode of transport of the three.The Commissioner for North Wales reports that at conferences of representatives of Food Control Committees recently held at Bangor and Newtown, one suggestion put forward was to the effect that all river fishing should be made free for the duration of the war.Press Comments. Practically no criticisms of the Ministry of Food have appeared during the Aveek.Supplementary Rations. Returns have been received from 1,526 Committees. These returns show that the number of cards issued is as follows : Cards Issued.Class F. &quot;Very heavy workers       - 582,054,, E. Heavy agricultural workers ... 214,888 ,,   D. Heavy industrial workers ...   1,560,841Total number of cards issued to heavy workers       -   2,357,783 Class D. Adolescent boys -        -        -        -        -     179,673Grand total  -        -        -        -        -        -   2,537,456
This total is 2 per cent, of the total number of cards issued to heavy workers.On comparing the number of cards issued with the aggregate population of those districts from which returns have been received, it is found that the percentage of the population in possession of supplementary ration cards varies (in England and Wales) from 14 per cent, in the Newcastle Division to 3 per cent, in the Carnarvon Division.In Scotland the figures vary from 6 per cent, in the Glasgow Division to 1 per cent, in the Inverness Division. The average over the whole of Great Britain is 8 per cent, instead of amounting, as was expected, to something like 14 per cent. ; the returns in the adolescent boys&apos; class, in particular, are very much lower than was anticipated.Enforcement of Orders.There is a decrease in the number of prosecutions, in comparison with the previous week, of 126. The total number of cases for the week is 704, 612 of which were successful. The North-Western Division heads the list, for the first time, with 103 cases and 91 per cent, of convictions. Glasgow is the only division (sending in over 12 cases) which has obtained 100 per cent, of convictions. The prosecutions are distributed over 63 Orders this week, four of which appear in the list for the first time : Persian Dates (Retail Prices) Order.Meat (Licensing of Wholesale Dealers) Order.Ships&apos; Stores Order.Cocoa Powder Order. :The number of rationing cases is increasing by degrees, particularly those in connection with meat, which numbered 28 as against 10 in the previous week. A series of heavy fines, in amounts of 100Z., 751., Q51., 21., and 21. respectively, with costs to the extent of 151. 15s., were imposed on a Stepney butcher, under the Edible Offals (Maximum Prices) Order.The illegal profits accruing worked out at about 100 per cent.Messrs. Lipton, Ltd., have reappeared in the prosecutions returns at Blyth (Newcastle), and at Willesden (H.C.). Both prosecutions were under the Conditions of Sale Order in the former place a condition was imposed on the sale of tea, in the latter butter was refused to the customer unless she also purchased her sugar there. Fines of 10L in the former and 131. 15s. (including costs) in the latter case were imposed.Forty persons wrere detained by the police in the East End of London on May 28th as the result of investigations made by Scotland Yard and the Enforcement Branch of the Ministry of Food during the last few weeks into alleged extensive food card thefts and frauds.A 3The number of cards issued to adolescent boys represents only a small proportion of the number of boys actually entitled to receive them.Class D. includes women and girls engaged upon heavy work.The numbers of cards actually issued to women and girls are as follows : Cards issued to women - - - - - 52,051 To girls (ages 16 and 17)  -        -        -        -        -      3,752Total     - -       -       -       -     55,803
PART II-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.The falling oil in cereal imports, having regard to the amounts on passage and the stocks awaiting shipment, need not be regarded as indicative of a&apos;restriction in supplies. Imports of bacon, ham, and lard, continue to be unusually heavy. Attention is called further on to the improvement in. the prospects of the live stock.  ,Imports.Owing to smaller arrivals of wheat and sugar, imports of food showed a further decline during the week ending May 25th, the total quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs received (Table A), being 210,900 tons compared with 261,500 tons in the previous week. In commodities other than wheat and sugar the amounts were not unsatisfactory.Arrivals of wheat and flour at 75,700 tons were the lowest for several weeks past and compare unfavourably with 175,100 tons, the figure for the corresponding week of last year, Smaller consignments of maize and oats balancing larger ones of rice and barley, left the total of other cereals at nearly the same level as in the week before. .; :..^-!v      ti -,.Only 13,000 tons of sugar were received, compared with 29,900 tons in the previous week and with 32,500 tons a year ago. Imports of sugar during May though up to anticipations have been far below requirements.Bacon and hams totalled 24,300 tons, an increase of 11,400 tons ; a falling off: in mutton and in meat unenumerated reduced the increase in total meat to 3,800 tons.Nearly 5,000 tons of lard and 3,800 tons of butter were received. Imports of cheese, although better than last week, were at a comparatively low level; only 32,200 tons have arrived since the commencement of the year, compared with 47,800 tons in the corresponding period of 1917.Consumption.Meat. The supply of imported meat at the four markets included in Table B for the week ended May 18th was the same as for the previous week. An increase of 5 per cent, in home-fed supplies led to an increase in total supplies (home and foreign meat taken together) of slightly over 2 per cent. Compared with a year ago, the fall in total meat amounted to 24 per cent. ; last week a comparison with a year before gave a decline of 31 per cent. For the week ended May 25th home supplies at the Central London Markets showed a welcome fall of nearly  7 per cent. Imported supplies were 33 per cent, higher. The net increase in aggregate supplies was 5 per cent. Of the total, 82 per cent, was imported as against 65 per cent, in the week ended May 18th.Variations weekly in,the number of fat stock passing through markets in England and Wales during the present year and during the corresponding period of 1917, are shown in Table C. Owing to changes in organisation and consequent delay in receiving returns, the figures for the later weeks shown are subject to slight revision. The noticeable fall on the week before for the week ended May 18th, 1918, amounting to 18 per cent, in the case of cattle, and to 14 per cent, in the case of sheep, is satisfactory. Later figures that are available for a comparison with 1917 show a decline on the corresponding week of that year of 56 per cent, for cattle and of 62 per cent, for sheep for the week ended May 25th.    &apos; ,Flour. Pending the tabulation of the bakers&apos; returns for the four weeks ended May 25th, some indication of the consumption of flour may be obtained from the records of millers&apos; deliveries : 	Deliveries from	Add one-ninth for	Foreign Flour		Controlled Mills.

Compared with a month before all the classes improved. Both cattle and sheep are now approaching the level of June 4th, 1917. The increase in the number of sows kept; for breeding is particularly gratifying.     -  ;The average for the four weeks to April 27th (the four weeks covered by the last bakers&apos; return) is 786,000 sacks ; the average for the three weeks to May 18th is 812,000 sacks. These figures do not show actual consumption, but have to be adjusted for changes in bakers&apos;, retailers&apos; and biscuit makers&apos; stocks. ] They never-theless suggest that consumption during May has not been below the April figure.Fish. In parti owing to the market being closed on Whit Monday, the total quantity of fish arriving at Billingsgate during the week ended May 25th showed a fall of 30 per cent.; on the previous week. Supplies aggregated 1,9*21 tons. For the week ended May 26th, 1917, the total, including an extra, day&apos;s return, was only 67 tons greater.Stocks.During the week ended May 18th, stocks of bacon and hams, and of lard showed further substantial increases. The former rose 10,200 tons to 56,300 tons, the latter 3,100 tons to 10,400 tons. Cheese has fallen to 6,300 tons., Estimated stocks, of principal cereals during May are shown below. Smaller importations during the past week have led to a lowering of the stocks of wheat.   They are, however, still higher
