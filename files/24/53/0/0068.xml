U.......Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. -Report for the week ended 4th, May. 1018*Land Division.S-nall Holding Colonies. &quot;Patrington.    Under favourable weather conditions, the farming operations referred to in last week&apos;s report are making satisfactory headway-    Sheep shearing is now in progress.    The crops, produce and stock disposed of during the week included 5 cvrt. potatoes, 400 cwt. palm nut meal, 51 lbs. butter, 61 pints milk, 5 pigs, 3 laying hens, 9 dozen chicks and 749 eggs.Heath Hill.    It is hoped to finish the planting of potatoes in a day or two, the total acreage completed to date being 52 acres. The remaining ground is being prepared and cleaned for swedes and turnips.    During the week approximately 40 tons oat straw and 20 tons wheat straw have been sold to the Army Forage Department.Holbeach.    Thehorsee have been kept busy amongst the potato crop, and have carted materials for the builder at suitable opportunities.    The settlers on the whole are progressing satisfactorily.Kelham Estate.The recent spell of sunshine, following the period of showers has been most favourable to the farming operations, and the crops generally are doing well.    The wheat, oats and barley are in good condition, with the exception of a few fields.    Owing to a very bad attack of weevil, it has been found necessary to re-sow two mangold fields with swedes.     The remainder of the mangolds are looking well.    The beet crop promises to be very successful. The horses, cattle, sheep and pigs are doing well, and the Oxford Down sheep especially appear to be a success on the class of land . at Kelham.The results of the Prisoner of War scheme have been good, taking into account that the maximum amount of work has been obtained out of both prisoners and horses.fflax Production Branoh.The weeding of the flax crop is nearing completion, and some of the camps are now being disbanded.     The work done &quot;by the various forms of labour employed has been fairly satisfactory, although in some districts the dirty condition of the land combined with the inexperience of the volunteers must result in a high cost per acre.    The flax crop as a whole is growing well, no case of serious damage by wire-worm being reported, although in some instances several acres have been destroyed by leather-jacket, and have had to be ploughed up.    The surveys and working plans of all factories and deseeding stations are now practically complete.    The only serious item outstanding being the decision regarding the site; for the Peterborough factory.    The consideration of this question is dependent on the result of retting trials now being conducted with the local water supply.    In the meantime, arrangements are being made for the use of temporary premises for deBeeding the crop in this area.
Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheriesand the Ministry of flood aDuring the week the Joint Committee circulated a large number of the leaflet &quot;Brief Particulars of School Boy Labour&quot; issued by the Ministry of National Service.     In one particular district -Brockenhurst, Hants - it &apos;has brought about an interesting development. Immediately on receipt of the leaflet, a Representative of the Committee interviewed the Headmasters of the Secondary Schools in Bournemouth who responded in a very sympathetic manner and promised to furnish the labour, as far as possible, provided sufficient demand was forthcoming-     There does not seem to be much doubt as to thiso The Camp is to be near the village of Sway;   the accommodation and feeding will be undertaken by tho Military Authorities and ths boys will be sent cut to work in small parties as dssivecU    The boys will be of 16 years of age or ovor and be under proper supervision^ It is proposed to begin the Oanp early in June, and to keep it going by relays until the potatoes are harvested.     District Representatives in other counties are also hoping to organise similar Camps.A well attended Meeting was held at Rye (Sussex) on the 29th of May, to consider the question of Home Cheese Productions    A Committee of ladies was appointed to assist in furthering the industry in the Countyc     A well attended Meeting of Farmers was held on the 3rd of June at St. Ives, Huntingdon.Pig Production Section.A large number of requests for information as to the formation of Pig Clubs have been dealt with.    Letters as to the difficulty in obtaining feeding stuffs have again been numerous and the matter has been brought to the notice of the Ministry of Pooda The Local Government Board on the 28th ulto issued a Circular Lector as to the amendment of Regulation 2 o in which was set out the Ilulos made by the Board and Hints on pig feedingo &apos;   Inquiries for copie3 of the Rules and Hints have been numerous-Ordnance Survey.During the week ending 5th June 1918, 94,317 maps were sent to Prance, 28,866 to the.Admiralty, and 3,655 to Air Ministry. 10 relief models were sent to Francec     1 draft of Royal Engineers for the Field Survey Companies was sent to France.Publications Branch.The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 978, in response to which 4,016 copies of Leaflets were desnatchedo     In addition 26 ,250 copies of Leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution^    During the week Ibod. Production Leaflets Hoc 39 (The Control of Pests of Fruit Trees in Gardens and Small Orchards) and Hoo 43 (Practical Hints on Potato Spraying) were published, copies being distributed to 10,000 and 11,500 persons respectively on the Leaflet Lists    200s000 copies of the latter leaflet are being supplied to the Food Production Department for direct distribution^Fisheries DivisionsOfficers of the Department have attended a Meeting of the Admiralty Sub-Committee on Reconstruction with regard to questions It       affecting the protection of Deep Sea Fisheries, and a Deputation of the National Sea Fisheries Protection Association has been received
partly in connection with the same subject, and partly with regard L     to future oentral control of British FisheriesJ     The Treasury have made a grant of . 6,000 to compensate fishermen of Hallsands for the damage done to that fishing village through the removal of the shingle for dockyard works:   it is proposed to appoint a ropresenta-tive of the Department ori the Local Committee administering the grant. Complaints of great destruction of fish off the Coastsof Cornwall have been received:   in one case the damage was caused by the stranding of a Norwegian ship laden with sulphate of copper: and on the East Coast of Cornwall complaints are made of the damage caused by the discharge of oily water from tank steamers.S SSi.l-&amp;S2l.4fiS*     53 Permits have been issued to fishing boats and 20 cancelled..jotor Loan .pommittcc.   The work of the Motor Loan Committee necessarily extends a^good deal beyond the actual installation of motors and is largely educational.    At the outset it was necessary to convince fishermen of the advantages of motor power for their boats, and the reports have on many occasions spoken of the difficulties and successes of this task.     It has further been necessary to spread a conviction that not every kind of motor nor every standard stern gear would make a satisfactory installation, and the object lesson of successful installation has not been enough to do this without some experience of failures where advice has been neglected.    Hor has it been enough to instal motors simply.     There have been many troubles through inexperienced management, and the Committee have had to attend to many adjustments, advise as to the best lubricating oil for each type of engine, and give instructions for its use The very small proportion of failures in tho engines they have installed is a testimony to the care in selection and the high quality of workmanship.     Where it was advisable the Committee have required improvement in details of manufacture, in addition to making arrangements for the construction of a special typo-     In several      instances by the courtesy of makers it has been possible for men to receive instruction at the works in the running of engines.     It could not be expected that all should go smoothly and there should be no serious breakdowns, but the number of these has been very small and far the greater majority of engines installed have proved more and more satisfactory as the owners gained experience in handling them.Freshwater ffjsh Committee.    Members of the Committee have visited certain waters on the Coasts of Hampshire and Dorset and have made a Report,1 which will be presented to the Fish Food Committee in a few days advocating the establishment of Eel fishery stations at four of the places visited, viz. Radipolo Lake, near Weymouth, The Fleet Water Chesil Beech, Poole Harbour and Christchurch Harbour.    The proposal is that the appliances should be provided by the Freshwater Fish Committee, who should employ fishermen to operate them under the supervision of the District Inspector.    The fishermen should be paid on a wage and Commission basis and be encouraged to form Co-operative Societies as soon as possible.     A note has been inserted in the Public Press urging owners of traps and other   eel capture appliances to operate them to their furthest capacity and if there are persons owning or controlling waters where such appliances do not exist, to instal them forthwith.    The Committee offers assistance and in special cases financial help.Fish Food Committee.Russian Fishing.    All supplies have now been obtained with the exception of&quot;the &quot;necessary Hemp Lines, of these the stock in the hands -Of the manufacturer is small and wholly inadequate, and the
Committee.&apos;s representatives have hecn visiting Glasgow, Sheffield, and Bridport, and are now going to Belfast to endeavour to secure such stocks as there are, and to divert to the manufacture of the necessary lines as much of the labour of the various Firms as can be utilised.     The required .stocks have to be delivered &quot;by the 15th. of -June, and tho matter is therefore most urgent.     Xt is feared that it will be impossible to obtain more than a proportion of the roqulred quantity *Ifcssei 3?ishing*   The Secretary accompanied by a Civil basins&amp;r has visited Teignmouth with a view to selecting a suitable spec for the erection of Tanks, the place is a difficult one owing to the fact that the Railway runs close to the shore.of the Istuary, and the expense of Tanks will be considerably increased by placing them on the landward side of the Railways    They, however, came to the conclusion that this is inevitable, and three alternative sites have been selected, one of which it is hoped may prove su:Uab&apos;ie*The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines indicated in previous Reports8Secretary*7th June, 1918.
