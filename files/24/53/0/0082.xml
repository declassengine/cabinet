Mr. Hoover has cabled to Mr. Sheldon asking if arrange-ments cOuld be made to censor the &quot;highly-glowing telegrams with regard to European harvest conditions.&quot; Mr. Hoover adds, that the publication of these telegrams in America &quot; tends entirely to destroy the energies of the American peoplea  (33)5875-1   Pk 1   130   6/18  e &amp; s a
&quot; and are destructive in every way and greatly weaken our abilities to supply the &quot; great deficiency in English production.&quot;Sir Guy Granet has sent the following important cablegram regarding the exports from America of bacon, hams and lard : &quot; The present position of stocks and anticipated exportable surplus of bacon, hams and lard in autumn and following months is result of fully deliberated policy of Mr. Hoover since his appointment as Food Administrator. At our early interviews with him in October lie made it clear that he was looking far ahead and was basing his whole policy upon the assumption that the war was to continue for a long time and that not only during the continuance of hostilities but for&apos;some time thereafter Great Britain and her Allies would require to draw from United States considerably larger supplies of hog products than they had been accustomed to do prior to August, 1914.   Last autumn the hog population in this country was considerably below the average for the time of the year, and therefore he was faced with the problem of providing not only for our anticipated requirements of the finished product, but also at the same time increasing the stock of hogs to assure sufficient supplies in the future. The corn crop of 1917, as you know, was very large, and to encourage the raising of stock and to discourage the marketing of any but heavy hogs Mr. Hoover decided to practically guarantee to the farmers such a price (by stabilising price of finished products) as to make it more profitable for them to feed corn into hogs rather than put it on the market.   Simultaneously the farmers were really forced to comply with Mr. Hoover&apos;s wishes owing to the fact that large quantity of the growing corn was so damaged by early frosts that it could only be used for feeding purposes. Further, Mr. Hoover publicly discouraged the marketing of sows believing that the level of prices he had established could be sufficient inducement to the raisers to breed as freely as possible, and all our private information goes to prove that the coming season&apos;s crop will exceed all records.   The domestic demand for hog products at that time was very large and in order to build up reserve available for Allied require-ments Mr. Hoover instituted voluntary porkless days.   This scheme was so enthusiastically supported by the people in the United States that stocks at the packing points accumulated much more rapidly than was anticipated, and in order to relieve the situation Mr. Hoover requested us to make the special purchase referred to in our previous cables as he did not then wish to reverse his policy of porkless days.   The effect of the porkless days continued so marked that again in March we were asked to make the special purchase of 200,000 tons referred to in our message embodied in Lord Reading&apos;s cable to Foreign Office of 6th March and subsequent cables, and at the same time Mr. Hoover decided reluctantly to relax his restrictions on home consumption. The people of this country, however, having evidently become accustomed to con-sume less pork took little advantage of the discontinuance of porkless days and the domestic demand is still more than 50 per cent, below normal.   Another factor having considerable bearing on the whole situation is the practical cessation of exports to Scandinavian countries, which, as you know, was a very large trade.   To-day the position is that after completion of present orders it is estimated that as a result of Mr. Hoover&apos;s policy and in order to prevent his being forced to completely reserve same it will be necessary for the Allies to purchase during the months of July, August, September about 50,000 tons per month, and approximately 100,000 tons per month from October onwards. While it may not be possible for you to definitely decide the quantities you are prepared to purchase for the next six months, it is really essential that you closely estimate the largest quantities you can arrange to take care of in order to enable Mr. Hoover to continue his general policy of making provision far ahead and not merely dealing with situations as they arise.&quot;The situation, as outlined in the foregoing cablegram, has been discussed at the American Board, and in conference, with the Shipping Controller. Sir Guy Granet was asked to suggest to Mr. Hoover that orders should be placed through the Meat and Fats Executive for two months, and that the remainder of the programme and the larger issues raised in Sir Guy Granet&apos;s cablegram should be discussed personally with Mr. Hoover on his arrival in this country. Sir G-uy Granet will return to England to be present at the conference with Mr. Hoover.
a -iBacon, Hams, and Lard.-The Ministry of Food has been in communication with the Local: Government Board on the condemnation and destruction of imported bacon alleged to be unfit for human food. The Local Government Board will make, arrangements to prevent the destruction of such bacon until an opportunity has been given to a representative of the Ministry of Food to inspect it.It has been decided to set up a Claims Committee in Liverpool to consider the incidence of the loss incurred through tainted bacon.The question of allowing bacon to be sold free of coupons in public eating places is under consideration.Butter. A purchase of 00 tons of butter at 431 cents per lb. f.a.s. in New York has been made. During the week ending 1st June, 1,607 tons of butter arrived in this country, 15,769 tons were in stock, and 12,168 tons were on passage.Cheese. Advice has been received of further shipments of 1,075 tons of cheese from Canada, making a total of 2,209 tons on passage from that country; 410 tons have arrived from Australia, and 1,109 tons are still on the way; 1,189 tons have arrived from the United States of America, where 5,198 tons remain in stock, and 2,061 tons are still on passage. ,Farina. The Government Farina Mill at Brayford has been run in an experi-mental way for some weeks past, and the tests made showed that certain alterations of the plant supplied by the contractors were necessary. These are now being carried out, aud the mill will start running on a commercial scale as soon as they are completed.The Agreement with the British Farina Mills, Ltd., has been completed in respect of the four mills which are to be set up at Boston, Hull, King&apos;s Lynn, and Monikie, and the Company have received authority for placing a considerable part of the necessary machinery and accessories.Meat. Instructions that only prime fat beasts are to be sold for slaughter diave been followed by the farmers, and a very considerable reduction has been effected in the number of live stock coming to market. The weather will, however, govern the situation, and if the present dry spell continues it may be difficult for farmers to keep back their stock. In the meantime the demand for frozen meat has been much increased, as was intended, and the consumption of imported meat has been greater during the past Aveek than at any time since the rationing scheme was instituted. It is estimated to have been over 8,000 tons, and it is hoped to maintain this output throughout June and July. The available stocks are sufficient to meet such a demand and at the same time supplies from North America are sufficient to provide a sub-stantial reserve by the time that the home supplies again come more freely into the market.The increase in the ration has undoubtedly given great satisfaction to the public ; measures have been taken to avoid issuing very inferior beef to the retailers, thus reducing the number of complaints received on that score. Meat set aside as un-suitable for retail use will be utilised by the manufacturers. -Milk. The Consumers&apos; Council, on 5th June, unanimously resolved that it was &quot; essential that the Government should forthwith take steps to control the wholesale collection, utilisation, and distribution of milk, on the lines indicated in the report submitted by Major Astor&apos;s Committee.A new Sub-Committee has been appointed to the Astor Committee on Milk to consider the prices for milk during next winter. The Sub-Committee held its first meeting on Monday, June 3rd.A proposal that the producers, wholesalers&apos;, and retailers&apos; prices of milk should be raised by id. per gallon throughout the summer until 30th September has been approved by the J oint Orders&apos; Committee of the Board of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food, and by the Consumers&apos; and Agricultural Councils.Tea. The registration of retailers is almost completed and the registration of consumers is proceeding. It has been decided to extend the period for the registration of consumers until the 15th June.Wine. The restrictions hitherto existing with regard to the withdrawal of wine from bond for consumption in the United Kingdom have been removed as from June 3rd. ,-...
The Inter-Allied Scientific Committee composed of two physiologists from each of the four conntries-Great Britain, France, Italy, and America have already visited Pans all(-l Rome and are now holding their session in London. They are supplied by the respective Food Administrations in each country with the statistics of actual and prospective supplies, and examine these with reference to the health requirements of the respective populations.At a meeting of the Agricultural Advisory Committee held at Palace Chambers on 4th June, Mr. Anker Simmons, with the concurrence of the Board of Agriculture, submitted a proposal that the Committee should be amalgamated with the Advisory Committee of the Board of Agriculture, that provision should be made for the repre-sentation of Scotland and Ireland, and that there should be one strong committee under the presidency of Mr. Prothero with an independent chairman.Lord Selborne said that he had expressed his feelings very clearly in the House of Lords and elsewhere as to the necessity for clear agreement between the Board and the Ministry on all matters concerning agriculture. The Advisory Committee was a very strong body and therein lay its danger; it might give advice on agricultural matters which was at variance with the advice offered by the constitutional authority. He understood that the duty of the amalgamated committee would be to watch the national interests of agriculture from the point of view of both producer and con-sumer, of Departments of Agriculture and Ministry of Food, and give the Government the best advice they could. They would, moreover, be in touch with the Consumers&apos; Council and thus have unrivalled facilities for that process of mutual education which would make it clear that the interests of producer and consumer were ultimately identical, whatever rifts in the lute might appear at first sight.Lord Northbrook expressed satisfaction with the proposal, which was carried unanimously.Organised Distribution.In many parts of the country the supplies of meat and bacon appear to have been fairly satisfactory. In some places complaint is again made of the condition of consignments-of frozen meat not being good-notably in Glasgow and the South Midlands. The Commissioner for the North of England reports a serious shortage of meat in the past two weeks, which he attributes, in part, to the Whitsuntide holidays. He adds that he is glad to be able to say that arrangements have now been made for providing the seamen on weekly boats with their week&apos;s supplies.Food Control Committees have been authorised to raise the weekly fat ration in .their area from 4 ozs. to 5 ozs. if there is sufficient farmers&apos; butter to provide the increased amount. Arrangements are being made whereby this increase may be extended, it is hoped, to the whole country after Kith June.It has now been decided that registration and rationing of lard will be separate from that of butter-margarine as from 14th July, and a separate leaf in the new Ration Book will be used for the rationing of lard.As showing the large supplies of butter now available, the Commissioner for the North Eastern Division says that it was found possible to stop the entire quota of margarine for Hull for one week, the amount being 24 tons.The returns of sugar allotted to caterers suggest that the effect of the Public Meals Order which came into force on the 3rd February has been to reduce the amount of sugar required by caterers by exactly one half. A return has been obtained which shows that the stocks of sugar in the hands of retailers in Great Britain amount in the aggregate to 26,725 tons, or rather more than ll- lbs. per head of the resident population.The Commissioner for the West of Scotland reports that a series of meetings is being conducted in the shipyards on the Clyde for educational propaganda with regard to food supplies. It appears that the meetings are well attended by the men, who show an intelligent interest in the questions under discussion, are on the look out for any wastage of cargoes or unnecessary loss owing to slow handling, and express the opinion that profiteering is not yet eliminated.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions reported in the past week was nine hundred and seventy-five, 846 of which were successful.   These returns compare favourably
with tliose of the previous week, showing an increase of 271 cases. The average line for England, Scotland, and Wales, was 31. .13s. 9c/., for Ireland, 3s. 5dL The Home Counties Division sent in the largest number of cases, namely 129 (124 of which resulted in convictions), closely followed by the Newcastle Division with 112, and the North-Western Division with 105 cases.The prosecutions were in connection with 63 different Orders, one of which  the Milk (Registration of Dealers) Order was new to the list. The most noticeable rise in the number of cases was that under the Meat Rationing Order, which increased from 14 in the previous week to 99 this week. The Tea (Provisional Prices) Order claims the largest number of cases, the total being 198, with 168 convictions.. Two cases of imprisonment were recorded this week from Blackpool, where G. A. Smith and F. Law were sentenced respectively to one month and two months, with hard labour, for obtaining ration cards unlawfully.At Bilston there were no less than 13 cases for selling new bread. Fines varying from 10s. to 101. were imposed.At Bilston a fine of 50Z. with SI. 3s. costs was imposed on W. Newman for sending in a false statement as to the number of meat cards in his keeping, and thereby obtaining 850 lbs. in excess of what he was entitled to, and selling same without coupons.Hardy&apos;s Crown Brewery, Manchester, were lined 100L and 25 guineas costs, under the Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order, and the manager was also fined 1002.PART II-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Among the more important features recorded in the tables, and commented on in the following paragraphs, are 1. The heavy supplies, especially of cereals, which have been received duringthe past week.   A continuance of these on anything like the present levelwill place beyond doubt the replenishment of the stocks by the autumn. 2. The satisfactory decrease in the number of home cattle coming forward forslaughter.   The effect of this will be seen in the herds in the late summerand autumn.3. The bread consumption figures, which show a decline, and compare favourably with those of last year.. . Imports.-Arrivals of cereals during May were high, and, except in the case of rice, were above anticipations. Imports of rice were satisfactory, but were about 20,000 tons below the estimate made at the beginning of the month. Foreign meat was received in larger quantities than for many months past. Imports of sugar, though barely sufficient&apos; to meet current consumption, were well above estimated arrivals. There was a marked deficiency in cheese.For the week ending June 1st, 1918, the aggregate quantity of the principal foods and feeding stuffs received amounted to 261,000 tons compared with 210,900 tons in the previous week and with 240,900 tons in the corresponding week of last year. The improvement on the week before was due to an increase in the imports of wheat and wheaten flour, which were received in larger quantities than in any week since July last. In equivalent grain they amounted to 161,500 tons against 86,300 tons in the week before. Other cereals declined on the week and amounted in all to 54,300 tons. The decline was in rice and barley ; the quantities of these commodities that were received were, however, above the average weekly importations during the previous weeks of the year.Owing to a marked increase in mutton, imports of which were higher than in any week during the past three months, the total for meat was well above that of the previous week.   Bacon and hams fell from 24,300 tons to 12,500 tons.Sugar rose from 13,000 to 17,800 tons ; in the corresponding week of 1917 the amount received was 19,700 tons.A 3
Butter was lower than in any week since the week ending February 16th, 1918. There was a welcome improvement in cheese, which at 3,000 tons was well above the figures for recent weeks.Consumption.Meat. The total quantity of meat, home and foreign, at the Central Market, London, and at Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool, increased slightly in the week ended May 25th over the week before. A marked increase in the amount of foreign meat, which formed 69 per cent, of the total, was responsible for the maintenance of supplies at the level [of the previous week. The figure for home-fed meat was the smallest for several years and 62 per cent, less than that for the corresponding week of last year.At the Central Market alone supplies for the past four weeks and for the corresponding weeks of 1917 were as follows : 	Home-fed Meat.

The percentage of foreign meat in the total was 86 as against 82 in the previous week.The receipt of later information has led to the revision of certain of the figures shown in Table C giving the index numbers of fat cattle and sheep stalled at various markets in England and Wales. The significant feature in the returns for the week ended May 25th is the further large decrease, amounting to 22 per cent., in the supply of fat cattle. The index fell to a lower level than in any week since February. For the week ended June 1st the number of cattle stalled was 60 per cent, less, and the number of sheep 64 per cent, less than in. the corresponding week of 1917.Final estimates for April (Table F) show that during the first month of national rationing the total consumption was 3 per cent, below that of March and the same as in January of this year. Supplies of foreign meat were 5 per cent, more than in March and more than three times as great as in January ; they were the heaviest since September, 1916. The consumption of home-fed meat was 42 per cent, less than a year ago.Bread and Flour. The returns of consumption and sales by bakers and retailers of flour for the four weeks ended May 25th, 1918, show a fall of 2 per cent, on the previous four weeks and on the corresponding period of last year (Table F). The amount of potatoes used in bread showed a slight increase, but is still negligible.Bakers&apos;stocks show little change : 	Four Weeks&apos; Consumption to May 25th, 1918.	Stock, May 25th, 1918.

Qd. to 60s. per quarter. That of oats has fallen from 47,s. Hd. per quarter to the lowest since December last, namely 44s. 9d. per quarter. A year ago the price of barley was 65s. lid. per quarter and the price of oats 54s. lid. per quarter.
