Colonel ft Dally Jones,, t^^f^i^^^        188MEMORANDUM FOR THE WAR CABINET.[        I em not quite sure whether I...rightly, understand the object of the Report of the Sub-Committee of the -Economic Defence and Development Committee.    In paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, there are references which appear to me to affect the position and work of the Imperial Trade Relations Committee over which I preside, and as I feel confident that there is no intention either to overlap, or still less to interfere, with the work of my Committee, I think, it right at once to point out what I believe to be necessary if any suggestion such as that in the Report of the Subcommittee is to be adopted.    In the re-commendation there is continued reference to economic questions, and I fail to see how, if these proposals are adopted, it would be possible to avoid direct interference with the work of my Committee.    When the Economic Offensive Committee was first appointed, I pointed out to Sir Edward Carson that there was a risk of overlapping and possible interference, but he made it quite clear&apos; that he would in practice avoid anything of the kind, and it was understood I think, that the work of tho Economic Offensive Committee would be confined to recommending measures for immediate adoption which were intended to have a deterrent effect upon the Germans by threatening their future trade.    Personally - I only give my opinion for what it is worth - I think the time is past when any policy of the kind is likely to affect them in the field.    Tho Germans are out for their existenceas
as they think, and they will fight to a finish, be the consequences what they may.But apart from this aspect of the case,&apos;I must, make it clear that my Committee is not only a Committee of the Cabinet appointed by the Prime Minister, but that it is a Committee solely of Ministers;   it is not even possible for permanent officials to represent Ministers at our meetings:   wo were given a distinct reference which was drawn up and approved by the Cabinet, and it would be impossible for me to assent to any-proposal which would make it necessary for my Committee to report to any other body other than the Cabinet itself.    I confess that I do not understand how any other body is going to enquire into economic questions without doing over again the work which we have already done, or anticipating the work upon which we are now engaged.    Apart altogether from the question of interference, it seems to me to be most undesirable that two different Committees, acting under different Chairmen, should be engaged upon what will practically be the same work.    My Committee covers the whole field, so far as I understand it, of economic questions, and I don1t think it is possible for any other enquiries to be made without encroaching upon our work.    I hope therefore, that before the recommendations of the Sub-Oommittee are considered in the Cabinet, we shall have a full statement of wjiat the intentions are, as the proposals vitally affect the Committee of which I am Chairmen.I submit that for reasons given above all questions of Economic policy must be left to the Imperial Trade Relations Committee.W.H.L.OOLGNIiiL OFFICE, 6.VI.1G.
