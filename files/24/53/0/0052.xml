Colonel W, Dally fees&apos;-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Goverpmenl.ltPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1918.SECRET.INDIAN COMMISSIONS.[Note by Lord Quezon.]THE Secretary of State has circulated a note explaining with greater fulness the recent proposal of the Government of India (which was refused by the Cabinet) to give 200 temporary King&apos;s Commissions to selected Indians, and we also have the reply of the Viceroy (18th May) to our telegram (27th April) stating our objections.The Government of India renew their proposal.   We must therefore re-examine it.Mr. Montagu uses the field-marshars baton-in-the-knapsack argument, and says that &quot; this is a method of earning by gallantry and good conduct in the field purely temporary commissions for the term of the war only.&quot;If that were the nature and object of the commissions, no one, I think, would object; for it is precisely that character of commission with which we all sympathise, and which we have already authorised with a not illiberal hand since the beginning of the war.But I gather from the later passages of Mr. Montagu&apos;s note, and still more from the Government of India&apos;s telegram, that the proposed commissions will not be mainly of this character. The great majority of them are to be of an entirely different description.The Commander-in-chief puts in the forefront the desirability of recognising services to recruiting rendered by men of influence, more especially in the Frontier Province, Punjab, I\T. India, and certain native States.In other words the commission will not be given for military service in the field, but is to he a reward to country gentlemen fpr assisting in raising the 500,000 men promised for the Indian army in fact, a sort of Indian Deputy-Lieutenancy. That this is the real ground of the proposal is again made quite clear in paragraphs 12, 13, and 14 of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of the 18th. May.Mr. Montagu further explains that these young gentlemen, if they are willing to come with their ryots are to be trained in Cadet Corps in order that they may take their share, if fitted, in leading those whom they have helped to secure.I turn to the earlier telegram, 20th April, for a fuller explanation of the procedure to be adopted. This telegram is not very clear, for in one place (paragraph 3) we are told-(a.) That these civilian candidates are to be nominated by Local Governments. (6.) That from the list the Commander-in-chief is&quot; to select names for submission to the Viceroy.(c.) That approved candidates are then to be given temporary commissions subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval.This undoubtedly implies that the commissions will have no connection with active military service, but will be in the nature of political rewards.But a lijtle. kter we are told-I. That a fair standard of education and some knowledge of English will be-demanded.2. That all nominees will undergo preliminary instruction at an officers&apos; training school, during which they will be graded and paid as cadets.3. And that only after these tests have been satisfied will the commissions be, granted.These are two entirely different conceptions ; for in the one case tjie commission is to be the result merely of nomination, in the other.of a modicum of instruction and certain elementary-tests of fitness.
Iii either case, however, it would appear that the commissions are to be given (a) apart from any field service ; (6) after a period of instruction that cannot fail to be utterly inadequate according to any standard hitherto applied. When the Imperial Cadet Corps was founded no commissions could be Avon in the Indian army until after a course of three years. But the, new type of officer is to be created at the rate of fifty every six months, after a preliminary training that would be deemed inadequate in any army in the world.I cannot help wondering whether this is really the type of officer that we want or the character of commission that we ought to create. Remember that these commis-sions arelto carry the right to command British troops, and British officers of lower ranks, in the field. And if the reply be that &quot; All officers are to be eliminated who fail to attain the professional standard demanded or who prove themselves otherwise unfit,&quot; the question arises whether the bulk of the commissions thus&quot; given may not have to be withdrawn, and whether the discontent thus aroused may not outweigh the compliment originally conveyed.The Commander-in-chief speaks of confining this class of commission to native gentlemen of the lighting races. I wonder whether this will be found possible. Will not the Zemindars of Bengal, Madras, and other non-fighting parts of India, when they see the prize of a British commission so lightly won, urge that the doors should equally be open to them ? When the Commander-in-chief speaks of nominations by local Governments, can he pick and choose between the local Governments ?I do not consider that the Commander-in-chief has given an adequate reply about the probable effect on British parents of the grant of commissions thus proposed. He says that the Government faced the risk when we announced in the House of Commons on the 20th August, 1917, the removal of the bar which had hitherto precluded . admission of Indians to commissioned rank. We did nothing of the kind. If the Secretary of State&apos;s reply be referred, to, it will be seen that all that he did was to announce the grant of commissions to Indian officers who had served in the field, and to promise a carefully considered scheme after consultation with the Army Council later on. No such project as this was then dreamed of, nor has it any logical connection with the proposals thus contemplated, and of which I was and remain the most ardent advocate.The effect of a too hasty or ill-considered grant of native commissions in India upon the future officering of the Indian army cannot be ignored. It is a consideration of capital importance. The more you hand over the civil administration of India to the Indians, the more will you have to depend in the last resort for the stability of the British connection upon the prestige and authority of the army. That army has hitherto attracted the pick of young Englishmen aspiring to a military career. In India soldiering was in earnest, there service was to be seen, there military fame might be won. If we in any way shake the popularity of the Indian army with our people here we shall pay a heavy price later on. It would be a poor bargain to run any such risk on the mere chance of favourably affecting recruiting in India at the present stage of the war.My colleagues should realise that the sentiment on the matter is universal and profound. Only the other clay I had a letter from a Lieutenant-General of fifty years&apos; service in the army, who rose to high military command in India, and was known there for his influence and popularity with the Indians. He said that he would not suffer any &quot;relation of his to enter a service in which he might be commanded by an Indian. This sentiment may be prejudiced or stupid, or both; the point is that it exists and is widespread ; and that, if it is to be ignored, it should only be in cases which admit of strong defence.If the Cabinet, therefore, is to be invited by the Secretary of State to reconsider its decision, I think we should realise exactly what we are asked to do ; and that if these temporary commissions are to be granted at all to the class of persons proposed, it will be most undesirable to name a total of 200. I would not myself publish any k number. I would gladly give the commissions to those who have won them in the field ; but I would be very chary about granting in large numbers what will in reality be a complimentary rank, and will rest upon qualifications admittedly inferior to those possessed by British officers in any other part of the Empire. For this would not be to remove a racial bar, but to create a racial privilege.C. of K.June 3, 1918.
