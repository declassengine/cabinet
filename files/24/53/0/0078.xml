Negotiations for an agreement &quot;between Denmark and tho United States have been opened in Washington.    The Danish Govern-meat desire that it should be a general agreement, to remain in foroe for twelve months.    They are disposed to treat as binding the terms to which they assented in the previous negotiations, to guarantee that no exports shall be made from Denmark other than those which shall be permitted under the Agreement, and to pro-hibit absolutely all exports, save under export-licence, to tho Central Powers,     But, under pressure from Berlin, they insist that 400,000 tons of Danish shipping shall be reserved for Danish use;   and that any exportable surplus of Danish produce, which is not required for the use of neutral powers, shall be equally divid-ed between the Oentral Powers and the Associated Governments.    The &quot;far Trade Board consider that 350,000 tons of shipping ought to be sufficient for tho national trade of Denmark.     They also propose to insist that any tonnage arrangement which they make with Denmark shall hold good for the period of the war.On May 23 Iceland concluded with the representatives of Great Britain, France and Italy an agreement which supersedes that pre-   I viously concluded with Great Britain alone.    The Allied Government!oromise unconditionally to facilitate the importation Into Iceland I1of fixed quantities of coal, cereals and petroleum.    The Agreement).&apos;: also specifies rations of other commodities (such as salt and tim- I ber) which Iceland may import if they can be spared by the Allies.t The Allies are to have the option of purchasing (a) all the wool of the 1j16 and lul7 clips which still remains in Iceland, except I 60 tons already bought by the Danish Government;   (b) all the salt and driod fish, fish oilsv fish meal, cod roes, mutton, wool and   j skins which become available for export from Iceland up to the enil of lul8.    Goods for which the Allies docline to exorcise their
.   ... 206 ioption may be exported to the United States, to Allied Countries or to approved consignees in approved neutral countries.   Iceland is permitted to export, under certain conditions, 50p000 barrels of herring to Sweden and 1,000 ponies to Denmark.   She is required to facilitate the shipment of dried fish to Italy, and to buy 30,000 tons of coal from the United Kingdom,   Her rations of cereals, pet-roleuin and benzine are to be bought through the British and General Trading Association Ltd.   The terms are extremely favourable to Iceland^ indeed the German press is complaining that Iceland has been bought by the Allies.   The Agreement will hold good until May 1, 1919.   It has still to be ratified by the French and Italian Governments.SWEDEN.    On June 5 an agreement with the British, French and Italian Governments was signed in London by the Swedish negotiators.   The United States War Trade Board have.already signified their adhesionto it.Under this Agreement Sweden will be allowed to Import, sub-ject to certain provisos and gaurantees, specified rations of a largenumber of articlesj she may also iraport without guarantees someother articles, to be enumerated in a &quot;freelist&quot;.   Rationed goodsif imported for private accounta will be consigned to approved Asso-ciations of Importers? if required by Government Departments theymay be consigned to the Swedish Government or the official Viotuall-ing Commission.    In consenting to recognise private Associationsof traders for this purpose the Swedish Government yield a pointwhich they have long contested. &apos;They have also undertaken to relaxsome provisions of the War Trade Law which have in the past made itimpossible for us to verify the good faith of Swedish importers.Among the advantages which the Associated Governments secureby the agreement, the following may be specially mentioneds-(a)   Sweden undertakes to prohibit effectively the exportto the Central Powers and their Allies both of rationed imports and of a large number of her native products and manufactures.
(b) She agrees that she will not export to the Central Powers, directly, or indirectly, more than 3,500,000 tons of iron ore per annum;   not more than 750,000 tons of slag and ores of low phosphorus content may be included in this total.(c) Her annual exports to the Central Powers of wood-pulp, paper and paper products are not to exceed the figures of 1&apos;j17,(d) Limits are put upon her exports of ferro-silicon and carbide.(e) She agrees to facilitate exports to tho Allied countries.(f) She will permit the passage of transit goods in stated quantities to and from Russiu and Finland, without de-man ding compensation.(g) She will cede to the Allies 400,000 tons deadweight of her shipping, and will permit one half of this tonnage to be employed in the war zone.(h) She will grant monthly credits to Francer Italy and the United Slngdom to facilitate their purchases in Sweden.?he Allies, on their side, grant some additional points of importance;(a) .Great! Britain agrees to license 150*000 tons of coal a month for export to Sweden.(b) The Allies v/ill purchase 2,000,000 tons of Swedish iron ore in the year ending July 1, lyi9.(o) Swedish wood pulp and,paper may henceforth be imported into the United Kingdom, subject to certain conditions as to the disposal of the purchase money*HffiriafiLAflD$*    The Dutch Government are now prepared to negotiate with the Associated Governments for supplies of foodstuffs and other over-seas products *    It is not expected that Germany will permit the itn-fjotftatioh of the full rations which the Associated Governments are /pfspared to concede.    Dutch exports to Germany will be negligible, exoept for cattles which will be exported in large quantities owing to the conversion of pasture into arable.The Dutch Government have decided to send a merchant vessel under convoy from the Netherlands to the -Dutch Sast Indies about the middle of June.    The convoy will avoid tho danger zone and will take the Gape route.    Only Government officials and Government cargo will bo carried; the cargo will not include goods of enemy origin, or
notmails.   The Dutch Government state that they will/agree to any examination of the convoy.Germany, in her present negotiations with the Netherlands, appears to have abandoned all hope of obtaining any large supplies&apos; of Dutch foodstuffs, and to be content with asking for certain assur-ances as to the future commercial and financial policy of the Nether-lands,   She asks for the following guarantees(a) That the Dutch Government will not prohibit the importation of foreign securities or the float-ing of foreign loans in Holland.(b) That they will not impose import duties of a protective character.(c) That they will not allow the import and export trade of the Dutch East Indies to be centralised in the hands of the colonial authorities.There is a rumour that the German Government are also asking preferential treatment, after the war, in respect of exports from the Dutch East Indies.   However this may be, the negotiations are in suspense.   The strong card in the German hand is the anxiety of the Dutch Government to obtain German safe-conducts for Dutch vessels inward bound with necessary supplies,   Germany is refusing to issue safe-conducts for particular vessels until a general agreement on the subject is arranged.Meanwhile M, Louden appears to be authorising exports of sand and gravel to Belgium on a scale far greater than that announced in the decree of larch 2,     The exact figures of this traffic are in dispute; but M, Loudon himself admits exports, between March 2 and May 5, of 273,000 tons.   The average annual exports of sand and gravel to Belgium were, before the war, only 350,000 tons,   H,M, Government are inviting explanations of what appears to be a breach of faith on the part of the Dutch Government.SWITffiiUfoANj).   The Germans are considerably embarrassed by the announce ment that the United States will convoy two vessels carrying wheat cargoes for Switzerland.
War Trade Intel 11 p;ence Department 7th June 1918,The Federal Government have learned that Germany and Austria Hungary will permit the sale to Switzerland of certain enemy vessels now interned in Spain.   The German vessels must he restored at the conclusion of peace, but it may be possible for Switzerland to keep the Austrian vessels for a slightly longer period.   The Federal Government can only afford to buy from 50,000 to 70,000 tons of shipping at current prices.   They need 240,000 tons for the essen-tlal imports of Switzerlandj   but they propose to depend chiefly-upon chartered neutral shipping0GERMAN SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.
