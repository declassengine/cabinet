PETAILliD REPORT ON BOMB RAIDS Cr.RRIhJD OUT ON lot JUNE 1918.12 De HavlXland 9s left it 7 aim-, to bomb METZ-SABLON rail-ay Station,   - Six machines were forced to return with engine trouble. Tho remainder reached their objective and dropped 12 112-lb, bombs from 13,500 feet.,     The wind being stronger than anticipated, 40. miles per hour from North East, the shooting was not good, and as the formation was  attacked by 4 enemy aircraft over the objective very few bursts were seen.     Smoke, however-, was seen to rise from a Farm about 1,000 yards from the triangle-.Anti-aircraft fire was very Intense and accurate, one of our observers being slightly wounded in the head.     A total of 10 plates were exposed.All our machines returned safely at 9.45 a.m.Pilots and observers report the building of a large Rod Cross right alongside the Main railway station which has been our objectiv for so long..    This Cross, which is confirmed by photograph, is at present unfinished,12 De-Havilland 4s left at 4.20-a^m. to bomb the important Railway Station and Communications at the Gare de Triage at KARTHAUS.     One machine was forced to return with eng.1ne trouble.. The remainder reached the objective and dropped 20 112-lb bombs from 14,800 feet,     Many bursts were observed beside the railway and round the objective, though the shooting was not particularly good.     This is probably due to the very high wind, in fact the target ran obliquely to it.In all,. 7 enemy aircraft were seen at various points; but, however, did not approach our machines, but fired rounds at long range,   . One of our machines fell in pieces near M33T714     Some observers think this was due to the observer shooting the tail partly off while aiming at enemy aircraft, as the enemy aircraft was at very long range at the time this occurred it. could hardly have been his shooting which caused the machine to break,31 plates were exposed. The return journey was done via VERDUN at 16,000 feet. All the remaining machines returned , safely at 8.20 &amp;.nu(sd ,) 0 .L..N,Newall, In the Field.
