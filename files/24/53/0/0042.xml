SECRET.I &apos;    &apos; - &quot; WAR CABINET,.;ff.T. 4742,-IMPERIAL WAR OSBIEBT. 1918 SESSION. PROVISIONAL DRAFT AGENDA AID TIME-TABU!.. Report of Lord Qurzon.&apos;s Committee. (Reference War Cabinet.411, Minute 18).1.   General Sjmuts, Mr. Long, Mr. Montagu and myself were-deputed by the War Cabinet to draw up a provisional Agenda for the forth-coming meetings %f the imperial War Cabinet.-3.   We had the example of last year to guide Us and were of opinion that, broadly speaking, it would be well to follow a , (-similar procedure.1:&apos;0n the other hand experience has shown that a .. too mathematical programme cannot be adhered to, and that after thefirst&apos;ten days or fortnight the Agenda is apt to adjust itself. . It seemed better therefore, after providing for indispensable ...... subjects in a certain order, to Indicate rather than to make&apos; arrangements for the remainder. .3.   The 1917 Session apened onMaroh SOth and closed on May 3rd..  During that period the Imperial War Cabinet held 14 meetings, sitting as a rule on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Friday afternoons.   The oversea members and the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and India attended meetings of the Imperial war Conference on the other days.   For a. great part of April the.   meetings of the full imperial War Cabinet were suspended in order to find time for the deliberations of the two main Committees en Territorial and Non-Territorial..Desiderata in the Terms of Peace. It may be assumed that the arrangemsntB.this year will follow a similar course, i.e. that the Imperial. War Cabinet will sit normally on three days a week, a partial suspension taking place at a later stage if It is found desirable to appoint Committees,4.   As regards the Agenda itself the broad principle adopted in 1917 was that the Imperial War Cabinet should discuss questionsIaffecting the conduct of the war and the terms of peace, while the Imperial War Conference should discuss matters of general Imperial interest less directly concerned with the conduct of the war, or arising: after the conclusion of peace..  This was generally-followed., though in the case of Imperial Preference, a subject -properly within the sphere of the Conference,  the introduction of an agreed Resolution at the Conference wa3 preceded by a full . discussion in the Cabinet.   The general question of future con-stitutional arrangements in the Empire was left.for discussion at the Conference,   But the Imperial War Cabinet naturally reserved for itself the discussion of its-own future constitution and &quot;arrangements..   In these respects the proceedings of the 1918 Session will probably follow the precedents set in 1917.-  5*   The. Agenda in 1917 provided for statements at the earlier sittings in which the effort and policy of the Imperial andIDominion Governments were reviewed and discussed, the later  -sittings being reserved for problems of future policy,, mpre par-ticularly those affecting the.terms of peace.   This procedure was,, to some extent,, modified in practice by the habit of
- 2 -carrying on at the Imperial War cabinet meetings the daily discussion of events or questions arising out of the war, reserving for the -alternate meetings of the British War Cabinet, as far as possible,,, questions of mainly domestic concern.   Ho doubt the same practice will be followed this year, and the Imperial war Cabinet, while in session, will be charged from day to day with the general conduct of the war.6.   Departmental papers;or memoranda bearing on the subjectb to be discussed at the Imperial War cabinet, whether specially prepared or selected from the memoranda prepared for the British war Cabinet during the last, few months, will be circu-lated in due course.&apos;7.   In the following provisional outline of an Agenda and Time-table., the first fortnight alone has been mapped out. ITo dates have at present been assigned to the other subjects that will probably come up for discussion-provisional Bates. - Subjects.1st Day (June 11th;) . General Situation.
