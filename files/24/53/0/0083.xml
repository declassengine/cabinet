*0 &apos;    oCirculated by the Secretary of State for India,SECRET. /This Document is the Property ofHjs Britannic Majest.y&apos;s Government.)O ) coil )^sr ^ I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet two telegrams -regardiug Afghanistan.7th June 19]8.E. S. M.7jFrom Secretary of Slate lo Viceroy, Foreign Department,1 st June 1918.Foreign Secret. Afghanistan. Sec telegram from Chief of General Staff; India, to War Office, No. 30890, .10th April. Have you any recent information regarding military preparations in Northern Afghanistan,, or further indications of Amir&apos;s attitude towards situation in Bokhara and Turkestan ?From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 5th June 1918.Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 1st instant. We have no further information of military preparations in northern Afghanistan. It is pretty certain that Amir sympathises with Bokhara as Moslem State striving for independence. Bokharan envoy to Kabul lias been treated with marked respect, but&apos;Amir shows no present intention of intervening to assist Bokhara.Recently I instructed British Agent at Kabul to ask Amir for an interview in order to deliver copy of my Delhi speech with translation and a friendly message from myself (vide papers sent with Foreign Secretary&apos;s letter No. 36 M., dated .10th May). Amir appointed 11 a.m. on 18th June1. British Agent appeared punctually, and after being kept waiting some time was asked to send any papers he had to Amir at different palace. He did, and after further delay Amir telephoned that he regretted he could not see British Agent at present, but had received speech and message with much pleasure, aud would answer both this and my letter of 10th January very soon ; that there was no cause for apprehension about his long silence, and that all was well.Amir&apos;s action in not seeing British Agent was doubtless lacking in courtesy, but 1 do not think we need regard it as ground for offence or mistrust. &quot;Amir himself asked us (vide Lord Hardinge&apos;s telegram dated 8th February 1916) not to judge him by appearances, and it has been our consistent policy to make every allowance for the extraordinary difficulties of his position and to believe that he means to adhere to his neutrality. He is said to have announced this again lately in Durbar.1 Date as telegraphed, but obviously wrong.
