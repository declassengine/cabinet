May 30, 1918-LJ-^W        I EM 0 H A O U M^^S5S5^^S ONPOLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT FOKEIGN OFFICE.rgermany/oo$.CERTAIN POINTS IN THE BASIS FOR THE PROSPECTIVE NEWA.U3TR0-GERMAN    ALLIANCE.The four main points in the &quot;basis which has been laid by the Imperial meeting at General Headquarters for the future Treaty of Alliance between Germany and- Austria-Hungary are represented fox the benefit of German public opinion as follows(a)  - TLs new treaty will not, like the old, be valid for only six years, but will run for a much longer period.   Twenty and twenty-five years ai^o mentioned.(b;     The old treaty was directed primarily, for defensive purposes as was always proclaimed, against Russia.     Russia is no longer formidable and is not likely to become so in the nearfutureoCn the other hand the War has ranged &quot;a whole worldof enemies1&apos; against the Central Powers,&apos;and the new Alliance must therefore be arranged to confront the menace of a future e-caliticn from whatever quarter it comes.(o)     With a view to military efficiency, the unity of con-caption and action, which is described as having characterised the Alliance during the v/ar, is to be maintained in peace-time, by assimilating and facilitating the transport and food supply services, and by coordinating the mobilisation and the munition-ing of the two allied Powers by a permanent agreement on the basis of complete parity.    The supreme commands in the hands of two monarchs will remain as before independent;   yet it is
contemplated that in the event of another war, the armies of the two Empires shall at the first deoisive signal aot like one body.(d)     The Alliance, which is described as having hitherto only contemplated the case of war, is to be converted into a perma-nent community of interests in tho economic sphere.2.      On the subject of the contemplated military unifi-cation or assimilation of the two armies, there has been a certain amount of independent criticism followed by reserva-tions and assurances.    These have naturally come in the main from the Dual Monarchy and particularly from the Hungarian side, where jealous maintenance of the special characteristics of the Hungarian army has always been a fundamental plank of the national programme.    The Minister-President, Dr.Wekerle, hastened to reassure Count Karolyi on this subject and said that agreements, even in war time, might deal with common action and armaments, without trenching upon the organisation of the army.     They in Hungary would maintain their rights of disposition (VerftLgungsrechte) in every regard.The chief &quot;German criticism comes from the organ of the Governmental Socialists, the Vorwflrts, which says that only a common German Austro-Hungarian Parliament could direct such a harmonious military, economic and political policy as that which appears to have been outlined when the Emperors met at military headquarters. Since this is evidently not intended, headquar-ters alone know how the harmony is to be preserved.Hertling, in an interview with the representative of a Hungarian newspaper, dealt chiefly with other aspects of the contemplated Alliance.     As to its military aspects his main endeavour was to make out that it bore no aggressive character and would not preclude an eventual Peace league of the World, a&amp;out the prospects of which he betrayed his private opinion by
na somewhat sceptical smile&quot;.    Speaking from the Austro-German point of view he said: &apos;&quot;We only want to consolidate the existing situation, and we desire after the peace to remain closely allied, as the war has &quot;brought us close to one another&quot;.The great military leaders, of the Wo countries were satisfied.&quot;I conversed with General von Arz and then with field Marshal von liindenburg and with Ludendorff. All three expressed themselves as very satisfied.&quot;It may be safely assumed that whatever Pan-Germans in politics or in the German Army may have dreamed of, the new Alliance will not, from the military point of view, reduce Austria-Hungary to the level of Bavaria or Wftrttemberg.in its military relations with the German Empire.    The conditions of the pro-blem on the ens side and on the other do not admit of any such radical solution.    There is not even now, in the fourth year of the war, any ds jure supreme command of the Central Allied forces, although doubtless there has in the later stages of the war been a very effective de facto one.3*      As has been already mentioned, Hertling repudiated the idea that the new Alliance would preclude an eventual Peace . League of all Nations,     Indeed he claimed for the existing Alliance that it had alv/ays been a Peace League and that it was even now fighting for peace.    He was optimistic enough to enter-i tain a confident opinion that further events on the Western front would bring an end of the war and that &quot;we shall have peace in the course of this year&quot;.     In this connection he had, he confessed, based hopes upon the attacks on Mr. Lloyd George &quot;which pointed to a strengthening of the idea of peace&quot;.   But his expectations in this regard had not been fulfilled.Dealing with the economic aspects of the future Treaty, Hertling said that he quite expected the adversaries of the Central Powers to insinuate that the new Alliance v/ould have an
aggressive character aril would therefore justify the Entente&quot;-s contemplated &quot;economic war after the war&quot;.    This would be untrue, fox all that the Central Powers wanted was their &quot;plaoe in the sun&quot;.     They were well within their rights in establishing the identity o:l: their common interests end consequently taking common action.     &quot;We desire to make the most of the possibilities which our union implies - nothing more&quot;.It may eventually occur to the Chancellor that the Western Allies might very well take a similar view of the desir-ability of &quot;establishing the identity or their common interests and of taking common action&apos;,     There is no lack of inducements for then to take this course.     The German Foreign Secretary, Rerr von Ktihlmann, has recently (kay 23) delivered an address to the Berlin Chamber of Commerce on the Treaty of Peace with Rumania      After enumerating all the economic advantages and privileges which Germany had succeeded in extorting from Rumania, he observed:&quot;Formal war indemnities are not demanded by Germany, but tho numerous privileges we have secured are equivalent in the opinion of experts to anything which would have been yielded by war indemnities.&quot;Herr von Ktlhlmami is really very modest.    Vihat Germany has irn-posed upon Rumania far transcends a war indemnity in its tragicsignificance.     A war indemnity is either paid virtually outrightlike the indemnity imposed by Germany upon France in 1871, or atworst it represents a charge upon the finances of a state spreadover a long period of time.   Rumania, on the other hand, is fetter*ed in her whole eoonomio activity and becomes the tributary vassalof Germany in respect of her leading natural resources, her grainproduction, her oil-wells and her Danube and Black Sea shipping.Ktlhlmann lifted a corner of the veil which coversGermany&apos;s similar schemes with regard to the Allies in the eventof a German victory.    He went on:
&quot;It would be a mistake, however, to turn our eyes only to the East.    There are the mouths of the Rhine (which, by the way, are for the present in Holland) and of the Elbe in the North Sea,    Future policy will have to see to it that German trade strives with redoubled daring and energy to travel once, more on the open sea&quot;.In what sense future German polioy is to supplement on the open* i i  -sea the economio enslavement of Rumania, is revealed by a note-.worthy article in the Muncheney Neueste Naohrlohten (No.2$0*May 18, p.4.)  /After pointing out that for Germany the flnan-clal burdens of the war will be beyond her oapaoity to bear un-aided, and ;that it will be impossible for her to transfer themdirectly to&apos;&apos;the shoulders of her beaten enemies, the articleproceeds: ;&quot;The course of events has meanwhile shown us a method which nevertheless would make our enemies participate in the gradual relief of our war burdens, without demanding from $hem more than they can do in proportion to their economio capacities, and without preventing them from repairing their ojm financial and economic systems which the war has ruined.    The model :s&apos; example of this method is the, Treaty of Peaoe.with Rumania.&quot;The article enumerates the lien established over Rumanian cornproduction for tens of years to come, the 90-yeare German leaseof the oil-wells, the institution of a monopoly company underGerman control to exploit the wells and the transference of therights of the expropriated foreign companies to German hands.England and $ranee have been expelled from the Danube Commissionand &quot;thus for the Central Powers there had been created the pre-liminary conditions for the realisation of tbosk great planswhich were bailed upon the development of traffic on the InlaMwaterways and which were of the greatest importance, more es-peoially for Bavaria.&quot; - v-v     a,;,v;The article concludesi&quot;Anyone who takes into consideration the totality of the advantages which we have even now seoured for the conduct of the war and for the nourishment, of the people, and wljo adds to them the abundant securities for future opportunities of economio development which the Eastern Peace opens for us,must confess that.....we   have&quot;made a very good bargain with theseindirect- war Indemnities and that we may be pleased if we succeed in making peace with the rest of our enemies on a similar basis.    The wounds dealt us by the war would then heal quicker than if we obtained war contributions like those
of former centuries in the shape:jrt. f 1 nan a 1 al^lnfl^amnltles&quot; and oessions of territory.&quot;4.     Dernburg, former Oeiman Colonial Seoretary, has recently developed the same thomo in the Vienna Neue Freie^ ^mnimK......urn mmm m mwmProsse.    An aoQount of his article was given in the &quot;Times&quot; of lay 29.    Dernburg, fully appreciating the value of the terri-tory and the economic sphere which Germany&apos;s conquests have opened up for her and whence &quot;she can strike her suction-roots deep into the heart of Asia&quot;, urges that neither these political and economic conquests, nor even the return of the German Colonies with a good slice of Africa thrown in, could enable the Central Powers to satisfy their own requirements in raw materials.&quot;Freedom of the seas therefore and the supply of raw materials must not only be demanded, but it must be possible to extort them by force, if neoessary.     So too, with our exports to the raw material countries, since only this trade can create the counter-values&apos; without which large imports of raw materials are not feasible.&quot;Under the specious phrases of &quot;freedom of the seas&quot; and &quot;supplyof raw materials&quot;, we know very well that Germany, if victorious,would impose according to the recipe of the Mttnohener BeuesteHachrichten a Rumanian Peace upon the world.    The same phraseswere used with regard to Eastern frontier States and Easternshores until Germany, still somewhat prematurely perhaps,thought herself in a position to throw off the mask.It may be noted in passing that Dernburg has beenproposed by the Radical (progressive) Party as their candidatefor the Berlin i/est-Iind seat, which has just become vacant bythe death of the President of the Reichstag, Herr Kaempf.   IfDernburg is retoned he will have increased opportunities ofstrengthening his influence in the country, but a seat in theReichstag need not, even under the altered conditions of today,bring him any nearer to ministerial office.
5,-     Already, in the case of Austria, demonstration hasbeen furnished of the one-sided method with which Germany appliesher economic methods and of the way in which she snubs her lesspowerful Allies when they venture tentatively to interpreteconomic arrangements in an impartial sense.    The AustrianMinister-President, Dr,Seidler, receiving a deputation of German-(l)Austrian agriculturists on May 16    said that the AustrianGovernment could not yet state the manner in which agriculturalproduce was to be collected from the producers, because theGerman Empire, Austria and Hungary, would probably be treatedas a common area for collecting purposes, and would be subjectto the same system of collection.     (Difficulties, it will beremembered, have been experienced in Germany in getting theagriculturalists to disgorge their stocks of produce at Govern-ment prices, while Hungary, the mainstay of the Austro-GermanAlliance, has systematically withheld supplies from Austria).Wolffs Agency, the mouthpiece of the German Government, prompt-ly leapt upon Seidler, whose position is at present one ofextreme feebleness, and declared:&quot;There can be no question of treating Germany and Austria-Hungary as a common area for collecting purposes,     Sermany must, no doubt, demand that, in dealing with the harvests, the same severe measures for obtaining possession of it (Erfassungsmassnahmen) which are enforced in Germany, should also be applied in the Dual,Monarchy&quot;. (2)As a matter of fact these &quot;severe measures1&apos; havenot even now, been universally enforced in Germany;   and, asfor the Hungarian landowners and peasants, they will probably  .snap their fingers at such announcements.    Meanwhile Germany(1) Quoted in Mflnchener leueste aachrichten, May 17, Ho.248, (g)       &quot;      &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; May 18, I0.249.
-a- .has thrown a sop to the half-starving Austrian^ &quot;by promising the export of a certain quantity of food-stuffs across the &quot;border, hut on very strict conditions as regards distribution.
