the attention of the home secretary and the commissioner of police has recently been drawn to many oase3 in which lotteries, or prize-drawings, or competitions in the nature of lotteries, have been advertised to take place on behalf of war charities.hitherto, the practice of the home offioe and the police has been to take no notioe of lotteries for charities unless some complaint was made.   if a oomplaint wa3 made, the promoters of the lottery were informed that it was illegal,and that.they would be liable to prosecution, with the result that the lottery was usually abandoned.     in view, however, of the inoreasing frequency and wide advertisement of lotteries on a considerable scale promoted on behalf, of war oharities, and of numerous inquiries asking the police to riti\* say explioitly whether .a lottery would be allowed or not, it beoame impossible for the police to continue to turn a blind eye to these breaches of the law, and the commissioner of the police, with the approval of the home secretary, issued the.following press communique oalling attention to the illegality of such schemes:r,- . &quot;the- commissioner of police of the metropolis desires to call the special attention of all who are interested in the conduct of war - - 1 oharities, and of the public generally to the fact that to advertise, to hold or to promote a lottery, tombola, sweepstake, raffle, prize-drawing, or similar sohome is an offence against the law.&quot;while fully sympathizing with the good objects to which nearly all war charities are dirooted, the police wish to make it known that thoy fflay be compelled to take action (being allowed no disoretion in the matter) when their attention is called to what, prima facie, are breaches - of. the law. ....&quot;this public notice is issued as of late there has been a growing tendency to adopt these methods cf collecting money for oharitable war purposes.after the issue of this warning notice, the commissioner of police reoeivod appeals from many oharitable war funds of undoubted repute and utility to bo allowed to oontinue sohemes already inaugurated, and, as he cannot now ignore breaches of the law of whiah he has official cognizance, he may shortly be put in the position of having to initiate proceedings which not only would be extremely unpopular but would result in the loss of a considerable proportion ^of the income of these charitable war funds.in london the belgravia 7/ar hospital supply depot, lady paget&apos;s fund, the children&apos;s jewel fund, the ivory cross fund have, on the representations of the police, agreed to abandon draws which have been advertised;   but they complain bitterly of the serious monetary loss thereby entailed.tho red cross have seoured the help of&apos; legal experts in the hope of devising some scheme for apportioning prizes in a way that will not too obviously bring them within the purview of the lotteries acts, but such devices oan at best be spacious evasions.     it is said that in the last resort it has been deoided that the prize drawing shall take place abroad, but the sale of tiokets or advertisement of the drawing in this country would still be a criminal offence.&amp;LOTTERIES PROMOTED Og BEHALF OF WAR CHARITIES.Memorandum prepared and submitted to Y/ar Cabinet by direotion of the Home Secretary.
A letter from the Lord Mayor of Liverpool&apos;s Prisoner of War Fund addressed to the Attorney General makes the point that about  6,000 a month is needed for this fund and that the only effective way of tapping the resources of the working olasaes is by providing the inoentivo of a mild gamble.    If lotteries are closed down, Liverpool will not bo able to raise the money required for this and other war oharities.   iIt has been suggested that the situation might be dealt with muoh in the same way as the sales of &quot;premium&quot; War Bonds by Selfridge&apos;s and Harrod*8, namely, by intimating that lotteries whioh were already advertised would not be interfered with, but that no new ones must be started.    In view, however, of the fact that several lotteries have already been dosed down by the Commissioner and that many localities, as in the case of Liverpool, look forward to those means of raising money as the only way of maintaining the flow of charitable contributions, this does not appear to afford a solution of the difficulty.    It would cause disoontent on the part of those charities which have already abandoned these lotteries on being told they were illegal; and it would wholly fail to satisfy those who look forward to lotteries as a regular source of income.It would seem, therefore, that there is but.one satisfactory solution, which would be to introduce a short Bill suspending the operations of the Lotteries Aots.in respect of all duly registered War Charities and possibly also of Hospital Collections during the oontinuanoe of the War.   The fact that all War Charities are registered and under effective control is a strong safoguard against abuse.An Act (the Gaming Amendment Act, 1910) has been passed in New Zealand which allows lotteries to be held for War Charities provided the prizes are gifts, and it may be that there has been similar legislation in our other Dominions.4R101-S.
