ENCLOSURE   TO   G,T. 4733.,P. 89 ECONOMY AND MOBILITY OP LABOURReport by the Permanent (Labour) Sub-Committee of the V/ar Priorities Committee, in accordance with War Priorities Committee 14th Meeting, Minute 2.The Committee have considered the scheme proposed by the MiniBter of Munitions for increasing the mobility of labour, as set out in the Cabinet Memoranda G.T, 4306, dated April 21st, and G.T. 4577, dated May 17th, particularly with regard to its extension to AdMralty firms.With the exception of the Admiralty Representative the Committee are of opinion(a) that short of industrial compulsion the scheme offers the only means for making full use of the labour of the country, for providing a system for rationing labour, and for directing it to the point at whichit can be most usefully employed.(b) that it should be adopted immediately and should be extended to Admiralty firms including Marine Engine Shops hut excluding Shipyards.   The exclusion of Shipyards is in the opinion of the Committee prac-ticable owing to the more migatory and distinctive nature of the labour involved.The Admiralty Representative opposed the scheme on the g-rounds that in the opinion of the Admiralty it involved industrial compulsion and would give rise to grave disturbance among the employees.     Unless Marine Engine Shops as well as Shipyards are excluded from the operation of the scheme the Admiralty desire that the matter should be brought before the War Cabinet.The other members of the Committee recognise the possibility of industrial unrest being caused by the adoption of the scheme;   but they feel that the urgency of providing men both for the maintenance of the Forces and the output of munitions is such as to compel the immediate adoption of an effective scheme, which will comprise not only the mobility of labour but also the enforced economy of manpower in manufacturing establishments.The Committee is of opinion that unless the scheme is applied universally, with the exception of Shipyards, the scheme is impracticable; and that incidentally the danger of industrial unrest would be much increased by any partial application.The Committee notice the references to the scheme that have recently appeared in the public Press, and they are of opinion that the matter is one which calls for an immediate decision.In view of the opposition of the Admiralty Repres-entative the Committee feel that the matter is not one within their powers to decide and they accordingly report to the War Priorities Committee in the above sense.(signed)   P. LLOYD-GEEAME.3J.5.18.
