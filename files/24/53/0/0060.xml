Colonel I, Dally Jones,irAcquisition of i Bull ding a. Memorandum &quot;by the Army Council,The following observations are circulated vrith reference to 0.T.4142J-In considering whether they are justified in talcing possession of the premises for office accommodation under the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations, the Army Council have &quot;been guided by the legal opinions which have from time to time been given on the subject.2,      The guiding principle is that, in order to justify the use of these powers, it must be shewn that possession of the premises in question is necessary for securing the public safety or defence of the realm.   This principle has &quot;been treated as covering the case of office accommodation required for any of the Defence Departments (Admiralty, War Department, Air Ministry and Ministry of Munitions) or for any other Department engaged on work which can clearly be regarded as essential for the public safety or defence of the realm, e,g. The Ministry of Food and The Ministry of National Service,3.There are, however, cases which donotso clearly fallWithin the principle.   Tho Ministry of pensions, for instance, is mainly concerned with payment of pensions to discharged soldi ere and it is arguable that thin work, however necessary it may be in the national interest, is not strictly necessary for the public safety or defence of the realm.   There are, however, arguments on the other side and the Army Council have been advised that, although the case is near the line they would be justified in using Defence of the Realm powers for this purpose in cases of very urgent necessity, and the Office of Forks has been so informed.4,tho ArmyXn the case of other Departments (o.g. Labour Exchanges)Council have been advisedthattheseought notto be exercised for the purpose in question.5,        It is admittedly difficult to draw the line in these oases and it may be argued with some force that under present conditions the work of, substantially, all Government Departments is so closely connected with the war that it is impracticable to discriminate between them.   Koreover, it is most desirable, from an administrative point of view, that all property required for Government purposes shall be taken under the same procedure andbe paid for on the same basis.   Otherwise the competing demands of the various Government Departments are bound to have a -prejudicial effect not merely on the prices which have to be paid for accommodation that cannot be requisitioned but also on the sums whioh may have to be paid for the accommodation which iB requisitioned.6.      The Army   Oounoil, therefore, consider that it is desirable to provide by legislation that the purposes for which possession of property may be taken under the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations shall include the purposes of all Government Departments and the staff of Allied Governments,7.      These proposals cover, those contained in 8 (a) and (b) of the Memorandum submitted by the War Cabinet Committee Accommodation,on
0, With regard to the proposal contained in 8 (c) ofthat Memorandum the Array Council are advised thav, as the le^al position stands at present, they would only be justified in tailing possession of premises under Defence of the Realm powers for the purpose of re-housing displaced persons or firms when they are en^ed on war work.   The Amy Council consider that the powers in question should cover the re-housing of local authorities or quasi-public &quot;bodies as well as of business firms, whether engaged on v/ar worl; or not, but that it should only authorise the talcing for this purpose of vacant premises,9. The Army Council realise the possibility of anylegislative proposals of this description giving rise to Parliamentary criticism of the   basis on which compensation is at present paid in respect of property taken under emergency powers, but similar criticism will inevitably be aroused by tfta Bill, which has been approved by the \7ar Cabinet in principle and is at present believed to be under consideration by the Law Officers, by which it is proposed to give statutory sanction to that basis.   The Counoil consider that the basis is a just one and that it can be successfully defended against attack,10,       The Council further consider that the possibility of delays in the acquisition of required buildings would be reduced to a minimum if the power to commandeer buildings required for the housing of Government Staffs were to be conferred upon H      Office of \7orks.5th June, 1916,
