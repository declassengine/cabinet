BATTLE SITUATION - NOON - 1ST JUNE 1918.

1. The Battle in CHAMPAGNE continues with the greatest violence. It would appear that the Germans are making every effort to push on in the direction of PARIS. There are indications that he will launch further attacks astride the OISE with the object of advancing down that valley.  It is reported that he occupied CHATEAU-THIERRY last night, and was making further progress between this town and ST-REMY.

The French carried out a counter-attack last night south west of SOISSONS, and besides regaining a little ground have prevented further progress, down the valley of the AISNE.

Our line runs approximately as follows :- northern outskirts of RHEIMS - ORMES - COULOMMES - ST.EUPHRAISE -CHAMBRECY - BOUJACOURT - J0NQUERY - VANDIERES - VERNEUIL -(inclusive to Germans ), thence along the southern bank of the MARNE to CEATEAU-THIERRY. The French hold a bridge head at DORMANS. From CHATEAU-THIERRY (which the Germans hold) the line runs northwards through ETREPILLY, west of EPAUX, west of PRIEZ, west of NEUILLY-ST-FRONT, west of CHOUY, west of ST.REMY, west of VIERZY, west of CHAUDUN, west of MERSIN to the AISNE.   From the AISNE the line runs north west through OSLY - LINGRE - CHEVILLECOURT, south of VASSENS, south of NANTCEL - CAISNES - to the OISE at SEMPIGNZ.

It Is difficult to obtain Identifications but extent of front etc. point to 45 to 50 German divisions having been used

2. On the rest of the front there is no change in the general situation.
