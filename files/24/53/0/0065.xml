[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Mrjestys Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. [June 1, 1918.]Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office,Finland /002.MEMORANDUM - onFINLAND AND TNK POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE NORTH OF EUROPE.THE political centre of gravity of Northern Europe has shifted to Finland, for with the definite abandonment of dreams of Constantinople after the Revolution of March 1917 the northern routes into Russia have acquired a peculiar importance  a fact which Germany lias not been slow to perceive, and she has laid her plans accordingly.The complete volte-face of feeling in Finland, the anti-Entente attitude of the leaders for the time being in power, and the policy they are pursuing, are not the result of a sudden impulse, but of a steady propaganda which has been worked with persistence and growing intensity since 1914.The foundation on which the propagandists built was the bitter anti-Russian feeling that has marked Finnish politics, and even Finnish social amenities, for more than twenty years past. The strength of this hatred should always be borne in mind if the trend of Finnish politics during the last few years is to be understood.Internally Finland has always had a troubled political existence. Its population i6 a mixed one partly Finns of pure Swedish, descent, due to the country belonging to Sweden until 1809 partly pure Finns, of Mongol stock, and in the East an atlmixture of Bussians.Somewhere in the last half-century the stirring of Nationalism among the Finnish elements led to an attempt to assert their individuality, and to secure for their language, literature (they began to collect their legends and to write) and customs, the premier position in Finland.This movement, sedulously cultivated and growing in intensity, was in direct conflict with the ideas of the Swedish-Finns, who contended that Finland owed its culture, forms of society and of government to Sweden. The fight, once joined, between Svecoman and Fennoman (as the upholders of Swedish and Finnish claims were respectively called) has continued. So clear-cut is the division that in Finnish education, from folk schools upwards, Finnish and Swedish institutions are maintained separately. The struggle was really one for the supremacy of a certain national culture, including language hardly racial, for among the Fennomans were to be found many of Swedish-Finn origin. Still less was it political, until very recentlyr when it has pretty definitely assumed a character that places the Fennoman party on the side of the Central Powers.Apart from this cultural division of the population there were and are definite political divisions Alt (old) Finns inclined to coquet with Russia and make the best of the Russian connection ; Young Finns, nationalist and violently anti-Russian ; Agrarians, whose policy is indicated by their name ; Sivedish party-representing the political interests of the Swedish Finns, and Socialists of the Marxian type, who from a negligible quantity grew to nearly one-half the population (as judged by proportional representation in the Landtag) in November 1917.- Political feeling among the various parties has always run high, but, during and since the Bobrikof regime, one common hatred, the hatred of Russia, made the various parties all but solid in opposition to the autocracy. They sank their personal differences in the face of the common &quot;enemy.In spite of the constitution granted by Alexander I, and sworn to by succeeding Tsars, the last Tsar and the Council of Ministers were bent on a complete Russification of Finland, whose very success and progress as an autonomous part of the Empire roused jealousy and told against it.There is no need to labour the point. Suffice to say that the loathing inspired by Governor-General Bobrikoff and hk acts led to his assassination; while of the intensity of the hatred he aroused, it. is only possible to judge after living among Finns.Followed some years of security and political sympathy under Governor-[367-18]B
General Gerard, a man of tact, and delicacy, who was finally brutally dismissed and replaced, first by Governor Backman, then by Prince Obolensky and finally by Governor-General Seyn, who came with an unenviable reputation earned in the so-called &quot; pacification &quot; of the Baltic provincep after the abortive revolution of 11105.He roused the anti-Russian feeling to a pitch of intensity that even exceeded all former manifestations. Finland&apos;s autonomy practically disappeared. The usual Russian methods of press and post censorship, house visiting, spiriting away of suspected or prominent persons, and espionage followed, and were in full force, right up to and after the outbreak of the great war.Against this all parties, political or cultural, were united, and against this a dignified passive resistance was exerted. Every legal, constitutional, and parliamentary means was employed to defeat the aims of the Russifiers, and the dogged resistance offered provoked admiration, and drew sympathetic protests from the nations of Western Europe, not once, but many times.This was the state of feeling in Finland at the outbreak of war in 1914; a deadly hatred of Russia and all things Russian, joined to a frank and deep admiration for Britain and things British. In 1918 feeling has swung round into the opposite direction as regards Britain, while a third party Germany has become almost an object of adulation among a considerable section of Finns. The process by which the change was brought about was simple. Hatred of Hussia had prepared the soil; German propaganda sowed the seed ; Finnish desire to recover autonomy, which rapidly grew to Finnish desire for independence and expansion, ripened the plant, which was watered by the extraordinary apathy manifested by Britain towards Finland.From the outbreak of the war German propaganda in the north was intense and openly practised, especially in Finland and Sweden.In Finland it aimed at weakening Russia, always a sympathetic proposition to a Finn. It was helped by the close connection that existed commercially and education-ally with Germany amongst leading Finns. Political life in Finland has always been closely associated with the University, the Imperial University of Helsingfors, and for long years the leaders have been either actual professors of the University or closely connected with it That is why, to-day, the majority of the Government are juris-consults, lawyers, or professors ; that is why &quot; Professor &quot; and &quot; Doctor&quot; are titles that recur constantly when leading men are discussed.For a long time Finland, spite of everything, remained loyal to the Russian connection. It provided volunteers, took its share of war-work, raised money for loans upwards of 800,000,000 finmarks for Russia. ,It was openly stated, and hope steadily obtained that the alliance between Britain and Russia would produce a modification of the conditions prevailing in Finland, and provide a security for the recovery of its autonomy. This feeling prevailed right into 1916. But so fai&apos; from the Russification being stopped, or even modified, it. went on more brutally than ever. Some of Seyn&apos;s acts were notorious, and a despairing feeling that they were abandoned by Britain to their fate took possession of the Finns.Meanwhile German propaganda had been active. Aided by Fennoman leaders and by University professors, some of whom owed their livelihood, reputation, and scientific standing to England, the educated youth of the country was captured.Underground intrigues went on all over the country ; rumours of revolt were rife, of arming and patrolling, most of which were probably spread by Russian agents hoping to guide the young Finns into some desperate action that would justify a definitive repression by Russia.Finns in Germany were treated with marked deference and sympathy, though Russian subjects, and no opportunity was lost of insinuating that Germany was the only friend on whom Finland could rely.At length, in the autumn of 1.915, young men up to the number, finally, of nearly 3,000 fled into Germany, using the pretext of an athletic meeting at Wasa as a means of escaping from Russian surveillance. They went ostensibly to get a military training, for Finland had no military establishment; really to fight against Russia.Now, in 1918, more than two years after the event, the plea is put forward that internal troubles were foreseen, and that these young fellows went to Germany to prepare themselves as officers for the service of Finland in the struggle that was ahead of the country. The fact remains that after the revolution of March 1917 they were allowed to return under an amnesty ; and the statement that the present troubles were foreseen&apos; is disposed of by the frank avowals of Finnish leaders and.-by statements
published by the Finnish Press Bureau in Stockholm, that even in January 1918 the outbreak took the Government completely by surprise.It was not till late in 1916 that letters began to speak in vague terms of the possibility of trouble and fighting inside Finland ; people were becoming nervous about the future, but it was more an obscure apprehension than intelligent foresight, and it is doubtful if any clear conception of the trend of events in Finland since March 1917 existed in the mind of anyone.It is equally doubtful whether the idea of independence (to which the megalo-maniac Fennorhan has now added that of expansion) was present to the minds of more than a few, though it is now averred as a justification for the flight of the Jagers to Germany in 191 (3.These ideas are due in the main to Germans and Geomarippliile Finns, ideas that have grown from week to week with the break-up of Russia and the determination of Grermany, if possible, to isolate Russia from the Western Powers. 1 n that isolation Finland would be an important factor ; an independent and enlarged Finland, enlarged, that is, eastwards, would control the northern routes into North and Central Russia, to the exclusion not pnly of British and American, but also of Swedish and Norwegian influence.In rousing a feeling in the country to support, these intentions, propaganda of the most virulent kind has been employed. Rumours have been spread broadcast that Britain is the direct cause of the internal troubles in Finland ; that she has subsidised the Finnish Bolsheviki; that her officers have led them both in the South and the East; that she is deliberately starving the country by holding up food cargoes; and that she is the instigator of the&apos; Swedish non-possumus attitude towards Finland  rumours that are highly effective in a country where the censorship is rigid, only a few Finnish newspapers of a violent type are published, and few Swedish or other papers penetrate.But propagandists have been most successful in playing on the anti-Russian feeling, and on the ultra-nationalistic sentiments of the Fennomans, until to-day the pro-German and anti-Entente section is largely composed of the Fennoman party. Leaders of this party who possessed names of Swedish origin are translating them into their Finnish equivalents a significant action.It is not without significance also that some Finnish M.P.S and some politically influential professors, who are well-known and esteemed in England, whose leanings have always been towards England, are at the present moment more or less pro-German. The pressure of recent events was the predisposing cause of this.And it is instructive to note how skilfully the pro-German Finn leaders have used recent happenings to foment an anti-Entente disposition in the public, while making the dependence on Germany as complete as possible.It is not proposed here to study the civil war in Finland as a special phenomenon. It will only be mentioned as one of the factors which go to make up the present political situation. Suffice to say, in passing, that what was at first a struggle between the Socialistic and non-Socialistic parts of the- population became swiftly a fight between the more conservative elements and a Bolshevik-inspired idealising Socialism, and has now degenerated into a life or death struggle between the lower non-possessing class and the bourgeois. Its causes are complicated with labour questions, war conditions and their sudden cessation, such as are dormant or partly active in nearly all countries, hut which became acute in Finland owing to its peculiar position.In the general political situation the Civil War is important because of the tension which it brought about between Finland and Sweden, or rather, which it made evident. For it is a mistake to suppose that this tension is a sudden phenomenon. Friction, irritation against Sweden had been growing for some years-the Fennoman %. Svecoman agitation accounts for that and all this in spite of the recognised natural orientation of Finland towards a Scandinavian federation.The refusal of Sweden to intervene actively in Finland, and her passive resistance to private help being given were but the last straw, the ultimate push that tipped the balance of feeling definitely against Sweden.It is still hotly disputed by the Finns whether appeals were made simultaneously to Sweden and -Germany, or first of all to Sweden. Whatever the truth may be, Sweden&apos;s refusal gave the pro-German Finns their chance, and they seized it at once. Application was made to Germany, and promises were received. But these can only have been the final act of the comedy. For, many months before internal trouble was scented, before even the country was declared an independent State, pro-German Finns, in 11317, had visited Berlin to lay the foundations of the German alliance and [367-18] B 2
propose to institute a Finnish monarchy with a German Prince as King. In the words oi a prominent Finnish political, &quot; they committed themselves deeply,&quot; and these men are now in power, working to justify their promises.The so-called promises of Germany produced an explosion of gratitude throughout &quot;White&quot; Finland, a gratitude carefully stimulated by the pro-German leaders, in spite of the fact, recently revealed, that Germany has never made any promises of food to Finland. The appeals were made in January and February of 1918, but help did not materialise till quite recently, end of March 1918. In the interim the action of Sweden in Aland had still further embittered Finnish relations, while the subsequent action of Germany there gives colour to the supposition that the delay was due to the difficulty of settling the price to,be paid by Finland for German assistance.What that price may eventually be was disclosed in the draft oi: a Finnish-German treaty made public on the 4th March. That treaty makes of Finland a vassal State dependent on Germany. Its foreign relations, control of its territory, commercial relations, industrial and shipping development, even its citizen rights, are all placed at the disposal of Germany. And whether ratified in its entirety or with modifications, it is a striking proof of the truth of the opening statement of this study that Germany intends, if possible, to use Finland as a barrier to Western penetration of Russia.The propaganda begun in 1914 as a means of weakening Russia by fomenting discontent within her borders, has culminated in 1918 in proposals for a A^assal State with a definite function to fulfil towards its master.What that function is I have indicated above. For it is worthy of note that it is after the publication of the draft treaties that hints begin to make themselves heard of a greater Finland. Suggestions of a Finnish &quot; Irredenta &quot; in Norwegian Finmark and Russian Karelia are made. Dark hints are thrown out about deputations of Karelians asking for help and incorporation, stories are told of Bolshevik irruptions in the far north all the usual mechanism of the preparation of public opinion for an actual claim and a definite movement is set going. And though, when the whole plot was disclosed a fortnight ago by the &quot;Politiken,&quot; Finnish politicals derided the suggestion and disavowed any intention of forming a greater Finland, the German-Finnish plan of an extension of territory which shall include the Russian government of Olonetz, up to the White Sea, and the entire Kola Peninsula with, of course, the Murman Railway throughout its entire length, is too appropriate to the rabid Fennoman temperament and to German interests in the north for these disavowals to be respected. Besides which, recent Finnish action has thrown a curious light on the disavowals; and the Finnish press at Wasa is hard at work vituperating Britain and repeating, unchecked, the stories that have been denied officially times&apos; and again. It is the old story  having no case they are abusing the plaintiffs attorney.With her foot in Aland, Germany commands the Baltic ; with an obsequious Finland extended northwards and eastwards, she blocks the trade routes into North and Central Russia, with an ice-free port on the Arctic in the possession of her vassal, she has a free hand in the exploitation of the timber and minerals of Kola, and of the vast mineral wealth, of Lapland, of which since 1917 the Finnish Government (and therefore, of course, the German Government) is fully aware.The pieces of the puzzle fall into their proper places, and the design is clear.One - tiling may yet disarrange these carefully-laid plans. The Fennoman v. Svecoman controversy bids fair to become in the near future a bitter political struggle.The Fennoman section stand almost solidly committed to the German alliance.Among the men who are governing is only one representative of the Svecoman section, all. others of that party have been prevented by the fortunes of the civil war from any public appearance, action, or pronouncement up to the present date.Although the opinions of many of these were knowui to be opposed to the ultra-Fennoman ideas, it would he unsafe to assume that the clash of opinions will be such as to overthrow at once the pretensions of the pro-German Fennoman Government.But as soon as ordinary life is restored to the extent that governmental institutions can function normally, the Landtag lie summoned, and free expression be given to the opinions of leaders and prominent men of all parties, it may be assumed that some derangement of the plans, some modification of the calculations of the pro-German Fennoman section will be possible.Till that moment arrives opinions are swamped in a wave of gratitude, of emotional outpouring towards Germany for the help that has definitely crushed the hopes of the Reds.Trading on that, the Fennoman-pro-German leaders are working desperately to make the alliance with Germany, politically, economically, and commercially, an irrevocable one.
They show an almost cynical disregard of the general public which is kept in an ignorance of the political machinations and their eventual issue, that is well-nigh absolute. In place of information they (the public) are fed on rumours and tendancieux&quot; statements calculated to inflame them against the Entente and especially against Britain. In fine, the present rulers of Finland are playing &quot; le grand jeu.&quot; , To a natural desire for the recovery of autonomy, even independence, they have passed to a brutally Imperialistic plan quite at variance with the traditions of the country ; and in gambling for that they are assisting, by all the means at their disposal, the well-defined plans of Germany for the control of Northern Europe.WM. T. GOODE.April 25, 1918.P. S.- Since writing the foregoing, two announcements are made which bear on the opinions expressed. They are confirmatory of the view taken of the general political situation General Mannerheim&apos;s push into Eastern Karelia with White troops, and the occupation of Sveaborg by the Germans. This latter is of a piece with the occupation of Aland It completes the control of the Gulf of Finland, just as the possession of the Aland ensures the control of the Gulf of Bothnia and paralyses Sweden.Some Notes and Dates that explain Statements in the Article.1914-Bobrikoff, assassinated by Eugen Schauman.

. The above is issued by the Political Intelligence Department with the following reservations: 1. With regard to statements, on p. 2, Finland provided volunteers for Russia in hundreds, while her assistance to Germany in this form numbered thousands. Her share of war work was not undertaken in a particularly liberal spirit.2. With regard to statements on p. 3, it should be borne in mind that the Swedish. Government knew that the Finnish Government had approached the German Govern-ment unofficially for help before seeking it officially from the Swedish Government.3.. It is incorrect to suppose that the Young Finn section of the Fennomans is almost solidly committed to the German alliance &quot; (p. 4)&apos;
