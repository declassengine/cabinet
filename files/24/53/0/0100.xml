SECRET.IMPERIAL WAR CABINET,  1918.Memorandum on Events in India, 1017-18, circulated by theSecretary of State for India.1. The Frontiers. The situation on the&apos;North-West Frontier of India lias been generally satisfactory (lining the past year. It became necessary in June 1917 to undertake military operations against the Mahsud tribesmen of Waziristan, who had been guilty of a series of outrages during the preceding months. The operations were successful, and a settlement was effected with the tribe on the 10th August. Since then, there has been no serious recrudescence of trouble in the North-West Frontier Province ; but difficulties arose in Baluchistan in February 1918 owing to the defiant attitude adopted by the Marris, a tribe occupying the hill country east of Si hi, over the question of the supply oi! recruits to the army. The Harris were subsequently joined by their neighbours the Khetrans, but the trouble did not spread further. Punitive measures were undertaken, and were successfully-concluded by the end of April, a formal settlement being effected with the tribesmen on the 2nd May.On the North-East. Frontier the external borders have been quiet; but towards the end of 1917 disturbances, also traceable to unrest caused by recruiting operations, took place in the Chin Hills district on the Assam-Burma border and among the Kuki tribesmen of the Manipur State and adjoining British territory. Owing to local conditions, the task of dealing with these risings has been one of some difficulty, and the situation, though believed to be well in hand, has not yet been finally cleared up.2. Tibet. The situation on the east frontier of Tibet remained unsatis-factory. Desultory hostilities proceeded between the Tibetans and Chinese throughout the year, and constant appeals for ,assistance reached the Government of India from the former. A British Consular Officer from China is now on his way to the frontier in the hope of arranging a temporary truce.3. Afghanistan and Central Asia. The Amir of Afghanistan maintained his attitude of neutrality throughout the 3rear, and there is no reason to believe that his loyalty to his engagements with, the British Government has been in any way shaken. But the general situation in Central Asia has been profoundly modified by the elimination of Russia from, the war, and the collapse of her authority over her Central Asian subjects. It is impossible to forecast what will ultimately emerge from the present chaos ; but it is quite clear that circumstances have furnished the enemy with a new field for political (and perhaps military) penetration, and a new means of striking at the British position in the East, and the indications are that he intends to take full advantage of them. The situation is engaging the attention of the military and political authorities. In Persia the situation has not developed satisfactorily, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have been compelled to incur increased military liabilities both on the eastern and western frontiers of the country. Quite recently tribal disturbances have taken place in South Persia, leading to a conflict with British Indian troops.4. Aden. An important decision was taken in August 1917, when the political control of the Aden region was transferred from the Government of&apos; India to the High Commissioner, Cairo, and the control of military operations from the Government of India to the War Office. The object of the former change was the better co-ordination of all matters affecting the Arabian policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Government of India remain responsible for the local administration of the Aden Settlement.SS.022   100  6/18 AA.-EXTERNAL AFFAIRS.
5. Mesopotamia. Sir Percy.Cox, Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia, pro-ceecled to England in March 1918 to discuss with His Majesty&apos;s Government the question of the future administration of Mesopotamia. He is now on His way back. Considerable progress has been made during the year with the settlement, development, iVc, of the occupied territory, a task in which officers of the Government of India have taken a prominent part.B.-WAR CONTRIBUTIONS OF NATIVE STATES OF INDIA.Since the 1st June 1917, the Native States have continued to make generous contributions for the purposes of the War. These contributions have usually taken the form of gifts of money, which Government have been asked to employ, either at discretion or for some specific purpose, e.g., the provision of aeroplanes, motor-boats, or tanks, the maintenance of Indian troops at the front, &amp;c. Such gifts have been received, among others, from the Chiefs of Baroda (5 lakhs, 33,0001.), Indore (5^ lakhs), Bikaner (20,000/..), Nabha (35,0001.), ditch (3,000/, monthly till the end of the war); Patiala, Kotah, Sirohi, Faridkot and Navanagar (I lakh in each case); the Shan States (5,000/,) and the Begum of Bhopal (2,000/.). Half a lakh was contributed by Udaipur, Danta and Bharatpur respectively. The Maharaja Scinclia of Gwalior gave 0,000/.&quot; for the benefit of naval officers and. men, and 30,000 francs for Belgian relief.In addition to the above, various munificent offers have, according to reports published in the Press, been made in connection with the War Conference held at Delhi at the end of April last, These include a contri-bution of 100,0007. per annum from the Maharaja Scindia of Gwalior for the duration of the war ; 100,000/. from the Nizam of Hyderabad, for tanks and aeroplanes ; a similar amount from the Gaekwar of Baroda; 20,000/. per annum each, from the Chiefs of Kashmir, Jaipur and Navanagar; three battalions of infantry from Patiala ; another camel transport corps from Chamba, and two additional double companies of Sappers and Miners from Maler Kofi a. Offers to raise new battalions have also been made by Bikaner, Kolhapur, and Dholpur.The miscellaneous contributions included 18 tons of tea from the Prime Minister of Nepal.Apart from the foregoing contributions, the units of Imperial Service Troops on active service are maintained by the Native States at full strength. Recruitment for the Indian Army from the Native States was placed in June 1917 under the direction of the Central Recruiting Board, on which the Maharajas of Gwalior, Bikaner, and Patiala were invited to serve. A scheme has recently been initiated for the formation in Native States for the period of the war of battalions of Indian troops enlistecVmainly in the State concerned, but officered, equipped, paid, and maintained by Govern-ment. The project was favourably received by the Princes present at Delhi during the War Conference, when they were informally consulted.0.-INTERNAL SITUATION, 1917-1018.The economic conditions produced by the AVar, especially the rise of prices of foodstuffs and. cotton goods, have proved a cause of anxiety, but on the whole tranquillity lias been preserved.Political Developments.--From a constitutional point of view the most important, event of the year was the announcement of policy which I made on behalf of His Majesiy&apos;s Government in the House of Commons on the 20th August. For convenience the terms of the announcement are reproduced below: &quot;The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with which the Government of India are in complete accord, is that of the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration, and the- gradual development of self-governing institutions, witn a view to the progressive realisation of responsible Government in India as an integral part of the British Empire. They.have decided that substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as possible, and that it is of the highest importance
as a preliminary to considering what these steps should be, that there should be a free and informal exchange of opinion between those in authority at home and in India. His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly decided, with His Majesty&apos;s approval, that I should accept the Vieeroy&apos;s invitation to proceed to India to discuss these matters with the Viceroy and the Govern-ment of India, to consider with the Viceroy the views of Local Governments, and to receive, with him the suggestions cf representative bodies and others.&quot; I would add that progress in this policy can only be achieved by successive stages. The British Government and the Government of India on whom the responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of the Indian peoples must be the judges of the time and measure of each advance, and they must be guided by the * co-operation received from those upon whom new opportunities of service will thus bo conferred, and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can be reposed in their sense of responsibility.&quot;Ample opportunity will be afforded for public discussion of the proposals which will be submitted in due course to Parliament.&quot;The announcement was followed in the autumn by my visit to India. The Earl of Donoughinore, Mr. Charles Roberts, ALP. (formerly Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for India), and Sir William Duke (a Member of the Council of India) accompanied me. The results of my mission are embodied in a report signed by the Viceroy and myself, which is shortly to be published. It is sufficient to state here that the report contains recom-mendations designed to give effect to the announcement of the 20th August, and the conclusions therein set forth have been the result of consultation with the Government of India, Local Governments and non-official opinion of all kinds.Internal Situation and the War. On the 2nd April the Prime Minister telegraphed&apos;to the Viceroy appealing for an increase in India&apos;s contribution to the war not only in troops, but in equipment of all kinds. The action that is being taken on this appeal is dealt with in other portions of this Memorandum. The importance of the appeal in this connection lies in the action that it enabled the Viceroy to take with a view to combining all classes of Indian society in a heightened effort to increase InchVs war effort in all. directions. I was in India at the time the&quot; appeal was received, and after full discussion with the Viceroy, it was decided to convene a Conference representative of all India at Delhi on the 27th April, by which date I had already left for home. The Conference was presided over by the Viceroy. It, was attended by Members of the Executive Council of the Viceroy, by representatives of the Provincial Governments, by non-official members of the Imperial Legislative Council and about 100 representatives selected by the Provinces from all shades of political opinion. Sixteen Ruling Princes were also present. The Conference, which was the first of its kind ever held in India, passed the following Resolution in response to a gracious message sent by His Majesty :  &quot; The Conference of Ruling Princes and representative leaders of all classes of the people of India assembled at Delhi to-day have authorised me (i.e., the Viceroy), in a resolution passed unanimously, to convey to His Majesty the King-Emperor an expression of India&apos;s dutiful and loyal response to his gracious message and an assurance . of her determination to continue to do her duty to her utmost capacity in the great crisis through which the Empire is passing. India is determined that His Majesty&apos;s confidence that she will not fail the Empire in its hour of crisis shall be fully justified and that man-power and resources of the country shall be utilised to the greatest possible extent in the cause for which Empire is lighting.&quot;This message embodies the keynote of the Conference. The Viceroy reports that the meeting exhibited a cordial desire to furnish further assistance to the Empire, and it is hoped as a result of the enthusiasm stimulated by the gathering and the measures to be taken in accordance with the resolutions passed by it to obtain half a million.recruits for the Army during the ensuing year. The Government of India have expressed the opinion that the object of the Conference, which was to enlighten India
generally on the situation and to enlist the co-operation of prominent men of all classes in the measures necessary to increase-her war effort-, was achieved. The continuance of energetic recruitment upon a voluntary basis and the formation of publicity and employment bureaux were approved. The immediate constitution of Provincial Committees was recommended for the purpose of co-operating with, the Munitions Board and other authorities in furthering economy of railway traffic and the encouragement of consumption locally of local products, and with a view to controlling supplies and promoting the immediate development of a programme for the construction of shipping, and the production of foodstuffs and war requirements.The Ruling Princes present at the Conference renewed their assurances of unswerving loyalty to the King and of attachment to His Imperial Majesty, and their determination to continue unabated to the utmost of their abilities and resources their efforts for the successful prosecution of the war.Civil Services in the War. It is worth noting that while duty in India, which itself is of real importance during war, has necessarily absorbed the bulk of the civil services, no less than 340 civil officers of the Indian Services have been lent in this country either to the Army or to civil depart-ments, while many civil servants have been released in India for military duties. Indian officials have also been able to give material help to the United States authorities in the detection and punishment of anti-Ally conspiracies in America.D.--THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY INDIA IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR DURING 1917-18, AND THAT CONTEMPLATED DURING- 19.18-19.Attached is a copy of a memorandum on the military assistance givenby India in&apos; the prosecution of  the Appendix I. wai.( conjpiled jn Marc]l 1917) and laidbefore the last Imperial War Conference. It shows what had been done up to March 1917, and attached, are copies of telegrams between the Secretary of State and the Government of India, which were also presented to the Conference, showing the programme of recruitment and formation of new units for the ensuing year .191.7-18.Operations, 1917-18.Mesopotamia. Daring the past year Indian troops have continued to form the bulk of the force operating in this theatre ; all the Divisions being-Indian except the 13th, which was despatched from Egypt to Mesopotamia when the troops, under General Townshend, were besieged in Kut-el-Amara.Egypt, There has been a very considerable increase in the number of Indian troops employed in this theatre. The Indian Cavalry portion of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions, who had been serving in France since 1914, have been, sent to Egypt, Two complete &quot;Indian Infantry Divisions&quot; have been added to the Force, and four British. Divisions are now in process of conversion to &quot;Indian Divisions,&quot; the necessary Indian Battalions being sent for the purpose of relieving British units for service in France.N.B. The main difference between a British and an Indian Division is in the Infantry. The latter includes only three British Battalions, with ten Indian Battalions.France. As stated above, the Indian Cavalry have been withdrawn and despatched to Egypt,Approximately, 40,000 Indian labourers have been sent to this theatre,, but the majority were enlisted for one year only, and these are now in. process of repatriation to India. A large number of Indian artillery personnel have arrived, and are being employed with divisional, ammunition columns in order to relieve the British ranks formerly employed with these units. The conversion, is being effected gradually as men can. bp raised, trained in India, and despatched to France.East Africa. Practically all the Indian troops have been withdrawn from this theatre.
Salonika.-Only a few Indian units (artillery and transport) are employed in this theatre, and these have been maintained during the year.Aden. The control of operations at Aden was taken over by the War Office-in August 1917, but the Force has continued to be maintained by India.India. During the past .12 months operations have been undertaken on the North-West Frontier against the Mahsuds (May to August 1917), and against the Morris (March to April: 191.8). In both cases punitive forces advanced rapidly into the tribal country, with the result that the tribes submitted to the terms dictated by the Government of India. Disturbances have also occurred in the Chin districts of Burma. These last have been dealt with by the military police without assistance from regular troops,,Gas i! a i/n ks.The Indian casualties reported up to 31st March 1.91.8 from the various theatres of operations were : --	i Killed and died of Disease.

It was estimated that this programme would require the recruitment of 101,453 combatants during the year. Actually, about 285,000 coni-batants were enlisted, and consequently the formation of a further .33 Battalions of Infantry, and 20 Squadrons of Cavalrywas authorised.In April 1018 the formation of a further 28 battalions was sanctioned, and, as they were urgently required in Egypt, 22 of them were formed by taking companies from Indian units already in the field, the men so with-drawn being replaced in their original units by drafts of young soldiers with not less than six months&apos; training from India. The remaining six battalions are being formed in India.This very considerable increase in the strength of the,Indian Army necessitated a reorganising of recruiting methods and a widening of the field of operations so as to exploit classes other than those recruited under normal conditions.The Central Recruiting Board was established in 1917 under the Adjutant-General to deal with the question, and Provincial Recruiting-Boards were formed by all the Local Governments. A strong Indian element was included in the Provincial Boards, which, work in the closest touch with the local civil authorities.Idle broadening of the basis of recruitment may be divided into : (1) Recruitment of races whose martial traditions have faded through long years of peace and who had ceased to be recruited for the Indian Army.(2) Increased recruitment of races normally recruited in small numbers only for the Indian Army, but who have done well in the Field during the present war.The method of work which has been adopted by the new organisation is for the Central Board to inform the Provincial Boards of the number of recruits, combatant and non-combatant, it is hoped to obtain monthly from each Province. The method of obtaining the allotted quota is left to the Provincial Boards, who are in close touch with local conditions.It must be understood, of course, that the Central Board restricts the recruitment of combatants to classes who have proved their worth in the field or who possess martial traditions. In the latter case the normal procedure is to enlist, say, one Company, and from this Ho form an opinion on the possibilities of the class under trial.Indian Labour Corps.In order to economise shipping, recruiting has now been limited to men willing to serve for the duration of the war, and companies from these drafts, together with men under 12 months&apos; contract williug to sign on for further engagement, are being formed in France.Indian Artillery Personnel.About 20,000 Indian ranks have been recruited, trained, and despatched to France, Egypt, and Salonica, where they are being emplo.yed to replace British personnel with Ammunition Columns.Indian Defence Force.Prior to the war a volunteer force existed in India; the units, however, were only liable to serve in their own locality in case of disturbances, aud their training left much to be desired. This volunteer force was converted in 1917 into the &quot;Indian Defence Force,&quot; in which service is compulsory for all Europeans and Anglo-Indian British subjects. The training and discipline of this force is far more thorough than was the case with tbe former volunteers and the liability for service more extensive. There is an Indian section of the force recruited by the voluntary enrolment of Indians.   The
/total strength Is rather more than 50,000 men as against 40,000 of the former volunteers.Munitions.The Indian Munitions Board was organised at the beginning of 191.7, and undertook: its formal duties as a Department of the Government of India on 1st April of that year for the purpose of concentrating attention on the expansion of Indian sources of munitions supply, or relieving other Departments of overlapping duties relative to war supplies, of preventing injurious competition in buying between different Government Departments, and of aiding the British Ministry of Munitions by centralising scrutiny, and by standardising the principles which regulate the disposal in India of applications from India for plant and stores of military significance.This new Department has taken over control of the existing ordnance factories in India, and considerable extensions are now being made to certain of them, with a view to increasing the daily output of gun ammu-nition from 5,000 to 25,000 complete rounds. An acetone factory is also . nearly complete, and. suggestions are now being made for the manufacture of machine guns. This, however, is only a small part of the work of the Munitions Board. A great deal has been done to develop the manufacture in India of military requirements other than guns and ammunition, such as boots, saddlery, serge and drill for clothing, kit bags, brushes, knives, forks, -spoons, and many other articles which formerly were imported from home.The result of this has been that India is rapidly becoming self-sup port-ing in many military necessities, such as clothing, leather goods, blankets and textiles generally, and supplies nearly all requirements of the Mesopotamia Force and many articles to Egypt and East Africa, thus effecting considerable economy in shipping and relieving the strain on home manufactures.Programme for further Expansion of the Indian Armyduring 1918-19.On 2nd April 1918 the Prime Minister sent a message to the Government of India asking them to consider how they could increase their efforts towards the successful prosecution of the war. As previously stated, this message arrived when I was in India, and after discussion with the Viceroy a Conference was assembled at Delhi to consider all aspects of the question. On loth May the Government of India telegraphed that they hoped to enlist half a million men during the 12 months ending 1st June 1919. Should this proposal be accepted, together with certain other proposals calculated to stimulate recruiting, and carried out it may be of interest to note that the normal pre-war recruiting figure for the Iudian Army of about 15,000 men per annum will have been increased to 500,000, or for every man formerly enlisted over 33 will now have to be obtained. A large number of these men will, of course, be required to provide reinforcements for the numerous Indian contingents serving overseas and to cover wastage among units in India, but after making a liberal allowance for the above, it is considered that the following new units can be raised for Imperial Service : 7 Squadrons Cavalry, 14 Batteries Mountain Artillery, 91 Battalions Infantry, 21 Companies Sappers and Miners,7 Divisional Signal Companies.In other words,, this programme will provide the necessary Indian man power for seven Divisions less Field Artillery and certain ancillary troops. The Army Council have not yet (3rd June) stated officially that they will be in a position, to arm, equip, and employ the new units as above.There are still a number of units from the past yeaFs programme which -are not yet on service overseas, but which will become fit for the field during the current year.. The present programme for their employment is (1) complete the conversion of four British Divisions in Egypt to &quot;Indian. Divisions,&quot; and (2) similarly to commence conversion of four British Divisions at Salon ica to &quot;Indian Divisions,&quot; (3) strengthen the Field Army in India.
It is hoped to complete this programme during 1918, when the &quot;Forces serving in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Salonica, and Aden will consist mainly of Indian troops drawing reinforcements from India, thus relieving, to a great extent, the calls on British lighting man power.Grant of Commissions to Indiana. In the summer of 1917 the War Cabinet decided that the bar that, had hitherto prevented Indians from obtaining commissioned rank in His Majesty&apos;s Army should be removed, and in accordance with this decision commissions were conferred, on nine Indians who had rendered distinguished service in the war. Proposals are now under consideration for the grant of a number of temporary commissions to Indians for the period of the war in connection with the increased effort that India will contribute towards the prosecution of: the war in 1918-19.E.-SUPPLY OF FOODSTUFFS AXI) MATERIAL FOR PURPOSESOF THE WAR.A year ago a memorandum was laid before the Conference describing . the extent to which the Allies were dependent on India for commoditiesessential for the prosecution  of  the Appendix II. war, and it was explained that had theresources of India not been available the difficulties of the war would have been enormously increased, if, indeed, its prosecution on the present scale would have been at all possible.During the past year the help so given has been continued, and large quantities of essential commodities have been supplied mainly under State control or by State purchase. In many cases, such as manganese ore, wolfram, saltpetre, mica,, shellac, jute, jute goods and castorseed, India is the sole or main source of supply ; in other cases, such as raw and tanned hides, wheat, rice, tea, and oilseeds, Iudia&apos;s contribution represents a substantial portion of the total world supply.Shortage of shipping has necessarily restricted the material aid that can be rendered by India, but war conditions have created special, cliffi-culties of another kind connected with the financing of exports, and these are now operating in the same direction. The resources of the Exchange Banks have, however, been mobilised with the object of giving preferential finance to exports of national importance, and it is some indication of the importance of these exports that, in 1917, out of a total export trade of 150,000,0007.., they accounted for nearly 88,000,0007. This was the value of exports of direct war importance, but many other exports, such, for example, as jute goods required for the movement of the crops of other countries, are no less important, and it would be within the mark to place the value of Indian, war exports at 1.10,000,0007.Numerous measures of State control and State purchase have been adopted, each adapted to the trade concerned and each designed to * ensure adequate supplies to the Allies at a reasonable price. Profiteering has been restricted, and in some cases, such as wheat, oilseeds, and hides, produce is obtainable at prices much lower than those ruling in other markets.Some of the more &quot;important commodities are dealt with below very briefly:  Wheat and other Grains. Indian wheat is for the most part required -for the Mediterranean Allies and Egypt, and in 1917 1,383,838 tons, of the value of .11,836,5217., were purchased and exported by the Government of India on behalf of the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies. The special measures taken last autumn to increase production resulted in the planting of the record area of 34,088,000 acres, and to ensure the harvesting of the crop recruiting was temporarily suspended in the Punjab, the most important wheat province. The crop will, it is estimated, yield an exportable surplus of 2,000,000 tons, and as it is highly important to avoid any inflation of
internal prices purchases will he made by&quot; the Royal Commission at an average price (certainly less than 50s. per quarter) much lower than that riding in other markets.In the past year 700,01)0 tons of other grains were supplied for military purposes in Egypt and Salonica, and India also supplies the grain required by the Forces in Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, Aden and East Africa, rice and flour lor Egypt, and flour for Salonica.Rice and Beans. Arrangements have been made for the Government purchase of 100,000 tons monthly at a favourable price, mainly for our European Allies, and this quantity, approximately, is now being shipped. Freight and finance difficulties may, however, bring about a reduction of this programme, and these causes will also operate to reduce the jmrchases of Rangoon beans.Tea-In 191.7 over 200,000,000 lbs. (0,757,9691.) were exported to the United Kingdom, and towards the close of the year a contract was entered into between the Food Controller and the Indian producers for the supply of all the tea required for the troops and for the civil population of this country. This contract has recently been renewed and the new contract involves the purchase during the next J 2 months of about 250,000,000 lbs., worth, roughly, 10,000,0001Wolfram, Chrome, and Manganese Ores.-The vigorous measures taken by the Indian Government to increase the production of wolfram ores have borne fruit, and, against a pre-war export of 1,700 tons, 4,839 tons (735,08,U.) were exported in 1917 to the United Kingdom, at a fixed price, for the manufacture of tungsten. Of chrome ore 9,057 tons (against 1,296 in 1915) were exported. India is practically tho only source of supply of manganese ore to this country, and in addition to supplying 354,276 tons (431,303/.) to the United Kingdom, considerable quantities (127,348 tons) were exporfed to the Allies.Saltpetre. The trade is under the strictest control, and with the exception of small quantities supplied to the Colonies the whole production is exported at-fixed&apos; prices to the United Kingdom and Allied countries for the manufacture of gunpowder. Last year 515,374 cwt. (677,8561.) were exported almost entirely to this country, which for this essential commodity relies solely on India as a source of supply.Tanned and Raw Hides and Tanning Materials. In addition to the large quantities of leather required in India for the manufacture of army boots .and accoutrements, this country depends very largely on Indian tanned hides, which provide upper leather for 60 per cent, of the boots manufactured. The whole exportable surplus is reserved and purchased for the War Office; tanning is under strict control, and the tanning of skins has been prohibited in order to encourage hide tanning. The war has brought about a marked development and improvement of Indian tanning, and in 1917 the value of the tanned hides exported was 3,346,185/.Paw hides, though less important, are still, in. view of the enormous demand and the shortage of supplies, necessary to the tanners of this country, and it is estimated that Indian raw hides supply from 5 to 10 per cent, of the upper leather manufactured here.The exportable surplus is purchased by the Government of India on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s and the Italian Governments, and last year 413,138 cwt. (2,151,404/,) were exported to the United Kingdom and Italy.Large quantities of tanning materials are also supplied, and in .1917 778,206 cwt. (294,241/.) of myrabolams alone were exported to this country.Mica. The trade is under the strictest control, and to ensure that suitable grades of mica are reserved for the Ministry of Munitions practically all mica is shipped to this country for selection. In 1917, 58,785 cwts. (474,744/.) were exported to the United Kingdom.Shellac. Shellac required by the Ministry of Munitions for this country and France is supplied at a fixed price (roughly half that now ruling), and in 1917 about 44,042 cwts. (311,6661.) were exported to the United Kingdom.Oils and Oilseeds. In 1917, in addition to considerable quantities of linseed and castor oil, 288,143 tons (3,425,188/.) of oleaginous produce (castor,SS (il!2 C
It is hoped to complete this programme during 1918, when the Forces serving in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Salonica, and Aden will consist mainly of Indian troops drawing reinforcements from India, thus relieving, to a great extent, the calls on British lighting man power.Grant of Commissions to Indiana. In the summer oil 101.7 the War Cabinet decided that the bar that had hitherto prevented Indians from obtaining commissioned rank in His Majesty&apos;s Army should be removed, and in accordance with this decision commissions were conferred, on nine Indians who laid rendered distinguished service in the war. Proposals are now under consideration for the grant of a number of temporary commissions to Indians for the period of the war in connection with the increased effort that India will contribute towards the prosecution of the Avar i,n 1918-19.E.-SUPPLY OF FOODSTUFFS AND MATERIAL FOR PURPOSESOF THE WAR.A year ago a memorandum was laid before the Conference describing. the extent to which, the Allies were dependent on India for commoditiesessential for the prosecution  of  the Appendix II. ^ -t wag eXpiajne(] jilat ]]a(j tiieresources of India not been available the difficulties of the war would have been enormously increased, if, indeed, its prosecution on the present scale would have been at all possible.During the past year the help so given has been continued, and large quantities of essential commodities have been supplied mainly under State control or by State purchase. In many cases, such as manganese ore, wolfram, saltpetre, mica,- shellac, jute, jute goods and castorseed, India is the sole or main source of supply ; in other cases, such as raw and tanned hides, wheat, rice, tea, and oilseeds, Iudia&apos;s contribution represents a substantial portion of the total world supply.Shortage of shipping has necessarily restricted the material aid that can-be rendered by India, but war conditions have created special cliffi-culties of another kind connected with the financing of exports, and these are now operating in the same direction. The resources of the Exchange Banks have, however, been mobilised with the object of giving preferential finance to exports of national importance, and it is some indication of the importance of these exports that, in 1917, out of a total export trade of 150,000,000/,, they accounted for nearly 88,000,000/. This was the value of exports of direct war importance, but many other exports, such, for example, as jute goods required for the movement of the crops of other countries, are no less important, and it would be within the mark to place the value of Indian war exports at 1.10,000,000/.Numerous measures of State control aud State purchase have been adopted, each adapted to the trade concerned and each designed to.ensure adequate supplies to the Allies at a reasonable price. Profiteering has been restricted, and in some cases, such as wheat, oilseeds, and hides, produce is obtainable at prices much lower than those ruling in other markets.Some of the more &quot;important commodities are dealt with below very briefly:  W-heat and other Grains.  Indian wheat is for the most part required for the Mediterranean Allies and Egypt, and in 1917 1,383,838 tons, of the value of .11,836,521/., were purchased and exported by the Government of India on behalf of the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies. The special measures taken last autumn to increase production resulted in the planting of the record area of 34,088,000 acres, and to ensure the harvesting of the crop recruiting was temporarily suspended in the Punjab, the most important wheat province. The crop will, it is estimated, yield an exportable surplus of 2,000,000 tons, and as it is highly important to avoid any inflation of
internal prices purchases will be made by the Royal Commission at an average price (certainly loss than 50.s\ per quarter) much lower than that ruling in other markets.In the past year 700,000 tons of other grains were supplied for military purposes in Egypt and Salonica, and India also supplies the grain required by tho Forces in Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, Aden and East Africa, rice and Hour for Egypt, and flour for Salonica.Rice and Beans. Arrangements have been made for the Government purchase of 100,000 tons monthly at a favourable price, mainly for our European Allies, and this quantity, approximately, is now being shipped. Freight and finance difficulties may, however, bring about a reduction of this programme, and those causes will also operate to reduce the purchases of Rangoon beans.Tea-In 1917 over 200,000,000 lbs. (G,757,969Z.) were exported to the United Kingdom, and towards the close of the year a contract was entered into between the Food Controller and the Indian producers for the supply of all the tea required for the troops and for the civil population of this country. This contract has recently been renewed and the new contract involves the purchase during the next J 2 months of about 250,000,000 lbs., worth, roughly, 10,000,0001Wolfram, Chrome, and Manganese Ores.--The vigorous measures taken by the Indian Government to increase the production of wolfram ores have borne fruit, and, against a pre-war export of 1,700 tons, 4,839 tons (735,08,1L) were exported in 1917 to the United Kingdom at a fixed price, for the manufacture of tungsten. Of chrome ore 9,057 tons (against 1,29(5 in 1915) were exported. India is practically the only source of supply of manganese ore to this country, and in addition to supplying 354,276 terns (431,303/.) to the United Kingdom, considerable quantities (127,348 tons) were exported to the Allies.Saltpetre. The trade is under the strictest control, and with the exception of small quantities supplied to the Colonies the whole production is exported at fixed&apos;prices to the United Kingdom aud Allied countries foi; the manufacture of gunpowder. Last year 515,374 cwt. (677,8561.) were exported almost entirely to this country, which for this essential commodity relies solely on India as a source of supply.Tanned and Raw Hides and Tanning Materials. In addition to the large quantities of leather required in India for the manufacture of army boots and accoutrements, this country depends very largely on Indian tanned hides, which provide upper leather&apos;for 60 per cent, of the boots manufactured. The whole exportable surplus is reserved and purchased for the War Office ; tanning is under strict control, and the tanning of skins has been prohibited in order to encourage hide tanning. The war has brought about a marked development and improvement of Indian tanning, and in 1917 the value of the tanned hides exported was 3,346,185/.Paw hides, though less important, are still, in view of the enormous demand and the shortage of supplies, necessary to the tanners of this country, and it is estimated that Indian raw hides supply from 5 to .10 per cent, of the upper leather manufactured here.The exportable surplus is purchased by the Government of India on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s and the Italian Governments, and last year 413,138 cwt, (2,151,404/,) were exported to the United Kingdom and Italy.Large cmantities of tanning materials are also supplied, and in.1917 778,206 cwt. (294,241/.) of myrabolams alone were exported to this country.Mica, The trade is under the strictest control, and to ensure that suitable grades of mica are reserved for the Ministry of Munitions practically all mica is shipped to this country for selection. In 1917, 58,785 cwts. (474,744/.) were exported to the United Kingdom.Shellac. Shellac required by the Ministry of Munitions for this country and France is supplied at a fixed price (roughly half that now ruling), and in 1917 about 44,042 cwts. (3.11,666/.) were exported to the United Kingdom.Oils and Oilseeds. In 1917, in addition to considerable quantities of linseed and castor oil, 288,143 tons (3,425,188/,) of oleaginous produce (castor,SS 622 C
copra, cotton, groundnuts, linseed,&apos; rape and sesamum) were shipped to the United Kingdom for the manufacture of food and munitions. Of these perhaps the most important is castor seed, now reserved entirely for the European Allies, which has become of vital importance in view of the development of aircraft manufacture.Jute and Jute Manufactures. The Calcutta mills continued to supply at favourable rates enormous quantities of sandbags&apos;for war purposes. Recently, on the initiative of the American Food Administration, arrange-ments have been made under which the total hessians required in the United States of America for the movement of crops will be supplied at a fixed price.The total value of the jute and jute goods exported in 1017 was over 31,000,000/&apos;., and as jute is so universally used for the movement of crops the greater part of these exports was of direct war importance.Wool. Large quantities of Army blankets are manufactured in India, the exportable surplus of East Indian wool being reserved for the War Office and taken over on arrival in this country at fixed prices. In 1917, 44,360,075 lbs. (2,508,6577,) were shipped.2. In addition to supplying large quantities of commodities essential to the prosecution of the war, and herself providing for the needs of the Army in.India and the Eastern theatres of war, India has by the mobilisation and. development of the industrial resources of the country materially lessened the strain on this country. The Indian Munitions Board have by a rigid scrutiny of indents reduced the demands made on the United Kingdom and America for manufactured articles, mainly steel and iron goods, and by utilising to the fullest extent local sources of supply and manufacture many articles which were formerly imported are now made locally.Considerable quantities of timber are being shipped overseas for war purposes ; somejndian woods will probably be found suitable for aeroplanes and rifle stocks; new tan stuffs have been brought into use; arrangements are being made for the manufacture of glycerine; the Avhole of the cotton and the greater part of the woollen textiles required for army purposes are manufactured locally; shipbuilding has received a great impetus, steel and composite barges, motor boats and steam pinnaces being built in large numbers; and large quantities of rails, sleepers, rolling stock and railway materials have been supplied to the war areas.3. Reference may also be made here to the valuable services rendered by Indians in the mercantile marine. Statistics of the number of lascars, foremen and stewards at present employed are not available, but in 1914 the number was over 50,000, and during nearly four years they have continued to work on British ships, largely in the danger zones. The restrictions on their employment during the winter months in the Northern Atlantic have been relaxed owing to the pressure of war conditions; many of them haVe been killed or wounded as the result of enemy action, and many are now prisoners in Germany.4. Railway Position. -Difficulties in the railway position b,ave been great. Indian railways have been depleted by the Avar of European staff, both supervising and subordinate, to the extent of 30 per cent. The Railway Board itself has given one member for service on the Munitions Board and another for the control of coal. In addition to personnel, India has supplied to military railways overseas a large quantity of engines, rolling stock, and other materials. Certain open lines have been pulled up to furnish rails for the purpose. The requirements of traffic have grown beyond all expectation as shown by the gross receipts which have increased from 42\ millions ( ) in 1913-14- to 50  millions ( ). The strain on railways has been enormously increased by the reduction of seaborne traffic. There has been an abnormal traffic in troops and military stores and coal, as well as in wheat and other grain, and in manganese and other supplies for military purposes. To conserve the railways and to use resources to the best advantage, passenger train mileage has been reduced, and fares, and to some extent freights, have been enhanced. A traffic Priority Committee has been created to regulate traffic, a Controller of Traffic was appointed some time ago, and now Major-General Freeland, R.E., has been appointed additional member of the Railway
Board for transportation duties with full necessary powers to pool railway resources and to make the best use of them.From early in the war Indian demands for replacement of rolling stock and for material for its repair have been reduced to a minimum. The demands so reduced have been allowed by the Ministry of Munitions, who have also recently agreed to arrangements being entered into for obtaining 100 engines and 5,000 wagons in replacement of stock sent overseas or worn out, If India is to go on meeting the requirements of overseas railways further assistance will be necessary,&apos;whether by the supply of additional stock and material, or by the supply of machinery enabling Indian firms to provide from local resources such railway material as may be possible.F. FINANCE.Military Expenditure. In accordance with the Resolutions passed by Parliament in the early stage of the war, India has continued to contribute-towards the cost of the Indian Expeditionary Forces a sum equivalent to what the ordinary expenditure on the troops sent out of the country would have been had they remained in India. Tho net amount so contributed in 1917-18 was about 4,250,000/., and it is worth noting that as by.Statute the revenues of India are not applicable, without the consent of Parliament, to defraying the expenses of any military operation carried on beyond the Indian frontier by troops on the Indian establishment, fresh Resolutions of Parliament would he necessary to increase the share of the cost at present borne by India.But the figure just mentioned only represents a small part of Iudia!s military expenditure. In 1917-18 this amounted to about 28,750,000/., as com-pared with an average of about 19,700,000/. in the years immediately preceding the war. This increased outlay has been occasioned partly by military measures required for the better protection of India and partly by active operations on the North-West Frontier, to which reference has already been made. In addition India is sharing with His Majesty&apos;s Government expenditure in Persia of a military or semi-military character.General Financial Situation. Reference has already been made to the vast quantities of commodities of all sorts that are being supplied by India for the purposes of the war. The purchase of these commodities has in the main to be financed in India. In addition the Government of India are financing, against repayment in England, the expenditure in. the Pi eld of the-troops in Mesopotamia and East Africa, the cost of the food and equipment, &amp;c. supplied to these forces from India and to the Indian troops in other theatres. The requirements are on a continually increasing scale, and in 1917-18 the expenditure so undertaken on behalf of the Imperial Government amounted to no less than 60,000,000/.&quot; The financing of this vast expenditure has entailed the most serious drain on the currency resources of the Government of India, and though every effort has been made to obtain silver from any available quarter, and to popularise the circulation of currency notes (efforts which, considering the circumstances, have been far from unsuccessful), the currency situation of the Government of India has always been most anxious throughout the year and on occasions critical. The world supplies of silver have been short, and the world demand abnormally heavy. In 1916-17 and 1917-18 India imported silver to the value of 29,000,000/. sterling. Other measures were also taken to increase the utility of the available resources for financing exports of war importance. First the portion of the Paper Currency Reserve that may be held or vested in British securities was largely increased. Secondly measures were taken to ensure that, so far as possible, the available means of financing exports from India should be devoted to commodities necessary for the prosecution of the war. But these measures were insufficient to meet the needs of the case, and recourse has been had to the assistance of the United States Government, A representative of the India Office was deputed to America, and the special features of,the Indian situation were explained to the United States Govern-ment. India is a country where the average of individual wealth is very small and it has for generations been accustomed to an abundant supply of metallic money.   The Government of India were convinced that if they
could not meet the demands on their treasuries for rupees there would be a financial panic which might seriously jeopardise their ability lo obtain the supplies of goods required for the war. These considerations impressed the United States Government aud they have readily responded to the request that they should sell to the Allies a large quantity of silver held in their Mint reserve. A special Act of Congress was required for this purpose. It was passed last April and the first shipment of silver to India under it took place in May. This measure will, it is hoped, tide the Government of India over their immediate difficulties, but it will be realised that the efforts made by India to finance the requirements of the Allied Governments have been attended with extreme difficulty and with much danger to the currency system, a danger which has not; yet been entirely surmounted, and which has compelled the Government to consider whether the demands on India cannot be restricted to some extent in the future.Direct Contribution by India towards the Costs of the War.The outstanding event of 1917-18 was the carrying into effect of the Resolution of both Houses of Parliament passed on 14th March .1917, under which, authority was given to the Government of India to make a direct con-tribution of 100,000,0007. towards the cost of the war. The intention was to raise as much as possible of this sum by loan in India, and to liquidate the balance by the Government of India, taking over the required amount of British war debt, meeting the interest thereon and gradually discharging the principal. In accordance with this arrangement a War Loan was raised in India in 1917-18. The response far exceeded all expectations, for, whereas before the war a loan of 4,000,0007. would have been regarded as exceptional, a sum of 36,000,0007. was received, and was in due course transferred to the Imperial, Government, and at a later date in the same year about 30,000,0007. was raised by the Government of India in the form of Treasury Bills for the purpose of financing war expenditure in India. The applications for the War Loan from all classes were &quot;most satisfactory, Large subscriptions were also received from the principal Native States. The Government of India state that the splendid response to their loan appeal was due in great measure to the patriotic efforts of Provincial and District War Loan Committees working under the auspices of the Heads of Provincial Governments,, as also to the. cordial co-operation of the Presidency Banks.In estimating the meaning to India of this contribution, which forms a landmark in her history, it has to be borne in mind that she is a poor and backward country, lacking many elementary advantages of civilisation which England and the Self-Governing Dominions have long possessed. It is not a case of denying herself luxuries, but of severely restricting expenditure on education, sanitation, and industries. The contribution represents nearly two years of her net revenue as it stood at the beginning of the war.Prospect for 1918-19. In 1918-19 it is proposed to continue as far as possible the various forms of assistance referred to above.&apos; Iudia&apos;s contribution to the cost of the Indian Expeditionary Forces is estimated at 4,750,0007,, her military expenditure at 29,000,0007. The military expenditure in India and in the field to be financed on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government is now estimated at over 75,000,0007. A. fresh Indian War Loan will be raised, and the proceeds will be handed over -to the Imperial Government as in 1917-18. The cunency difficulties which have been discussed above have up to the present time prevented the Government of India from coming forward with any further offer of direct financial assistance for the prosecution of the war. I discussed this question with the Viceroy and Government of India when in India, and I am satisfied that had it not been for the difficulties of the currency situation it would have formed one of the. issues at the Conference at Delhi.E.. S. M.June 1918.
APPENDIX I.MEMORANDUM ON THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY INDIA IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR.The connection of India with the war opens up large questions affecting the constitution of the British Empire and the place occupied in it by India. These questions it is not proposed now to discuss. The object of this Memorandum is to present a concise yet fairly comprehensive account of the military assistance which India contributed in the first months of the war in despatching trained troops to France and Egypt; in supplying subsequently men, officers, munitions and materials ; and lastly in conducting considerable operations in Mesopotamia and East Africa. It is proposed first to indicate the general military position in India prior to the outbreak of war ; then to describe the military arrangements made by the Indian Government and the extent of India&apos;s military contribution; and lastly to set forth the present situation, both, external and internal, so far as India is concerned.I.-The General Military Position in India- prior to the Outbreak of the War.In -July 1914 the Army of India consisted of9 Regiments of British Cavalry. 39 Regiments of Indian Cavalry. 52 Battalions of British Infantry. 138 Battalions of Indian Infantry. 5C Batteries of Horse and Field Artillery. -6 Batteries of Heavy Artillery.8 Batteries of British Mountain Artillery. 12 Batteries of Indian Mountain Artillery. 21 -Companies of British Royal Garrison Artillery.1 Company of Indian Garrison Artillery.3 Regiments of Indian Sappers and Miners (19 service companies).The above, together with certain subsidiary units such as Signal Corps, Ammunition Columns, &amp;c, aggregated an Army of about 78,000 British troops and 158,000 Indian troops. The Military Budget was approximately 20,000,0001. -There were also 18,000 Imperial Service troops. So that the wdiole combatant Regular force may he roughly estimated at a quarter of a million lighting men.In addition to the above there were about 34,000 Military Police and. Border Militia, as well as 37,000 Volunteers of varying quality.The Army in India was organised in 10 Divisional Areas, including Burma, and four Independent Brigades including Aden. Under the so-called &quot; Kitchener Scheme &quot; it was devised to provide on mobilisation a Field Force of 9 Infantry Divisions and 8 Cavalry Brigades; but as a matter of fact the proposed organisation was incomplete, and India was only really capable of mobilising about 7 Divisions and 6 Cavalry Brigades with due regard to Internal Defence.India also furnished a certain number of native regiments for Imperial Service in China and the Colonies. At the outbreak of war there were 8 Indian battalions and one Indian Mountain Battery so employed.Prior to the declaration of war India was enjoying profound peace. The Frontier was tranquil, and so far as Military India was concerned there was not a cloud on the horizon.II. Military Arrangements consequent on the Declaration of War.. On the 29th July 1.91.4 the War Office intimated to the India &apos;0ffice the adoption of what is styled &quot; The Precautionary Stage,&quot;   A telegram was atss 622 D
: uonce despatched to the Viceroy and the Resident at Aden. On the 30th the Government oi&apos; India acknowledged the telegram, and intimated their ability to despatch overseas a Force consisting of 2 Divisions and one Cavalry Brigade. On the 1st August all officers on leave were recalled, to duty by the India Ollice, while retired and unemployed officers were circularised regarding re-employment. On the 4th August war was declared. In the course of the next few days it Avas arranged (1) That the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meernt) Divisions, and one Cavalry Brigade should be sent from India to Egypt. This Force Avas originally styled Force &quot;A,&quot; as its destination was then undetermined.(2) That four officers from every British unit of Cavalry and Infantry, as Aveil as a proportion of Engineer and Artillery Officers, on leave in England, should be transferred to the War Office, and that some 280 officers of the Indian Army on leave should similarly be placed at their disposal.(3) That Forces should be organised for despatch to British East Africa, and for offensive operations against the German Colony.Those measures were, however, only a beginning, and as the weeks and months wore on further demands Avere made on India to which she loyally and promptly responded (1) A battalion of Indian Infantry participated in the Japanese attack on Kiao Chao.(2) Reliefs of Indian troops, in place of British Avere furnished for Singapore and Mauritius.(3) On the 27th August it Avas decided to send Force &quot; xV &quot; to France, and with this in vieAv the Cavalry for Force &quot;A &quot; was increased from one Brigade to two Divisions of three Brigades each. At the same time more Artillery Avas recpiisitioned from India, including four additional Royal Field Artillery Brigades for Force &quot;A.&quot;(4) On the 18th September a portion of Force &quot; E &quot; Avas despatched from Bombay to Egypt.(5) On the 22nd September the Government of India Avas informed that the substitution of Territorials for Regulars iii India in all but the three Frontier Divisions had been authorised by the Cabinet, and steps to carry out this&apos; order Avere at once taken.(6) On the 26th September the India Office put forward a scheme for the despatch of troops to the Persian Gulf. These proposals aarere accepted in principle by His Majesty&apos;s GoArernment on the 28th September, but definite orders Avere not given till the 2nd October. The 6th or Poona Division was originally detailed for these opera-tions. On the 5th November Avar with Turkey Avas declared and on the 6th the leading Brigade of the Division commenced hostilities. This force, designated Force &quot; D,&quot; had been expanded by April 1915 to a strength of tAvo Divisions and one Cavalry Brigade.(7) During October arrangements were made for sending further reinforcements of Indian troops to Egypt for the defence of the Canal (Force &quot; E &quot;). These ultimately consisted of an Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, and the equivalent of two Divisions of Indian Infantry, including one Brigade of Imperial Service Troops.(8) Later in the autumn 20 Horse, Field and Heavy batteries and 32 battalions of British Infantry were sent to England for incorporation in the Field Army for France.(9) The equivalent of a Brigade together witli tAvo Indian Mountain - Batteries Avas detached from Force &quot; E &quot; to the Dardanelles hi May 1915.(10) The garrison of Aden Avas reinforced by a Brigade from Force &quot; E &quot; during the summer of 1915.
The total of all these&apos;various forces, detachments and reinforcements nm^peidiapsbeslf be stated in terms of units.   Up to June 1015 India had given for&apos;servic6 beyond&apos;its political limits :- &apos; 0 Regiments British Cavalry. 41 Battalions British Infantry. I Battalion Territorial Infantry. 0 Batteries Royal Horse Artillery. 34 Batteries Royal Field Artillery. 1 Battery Territorial Artillery.5 Batteries Heavy Artillery (Royal Garrison Artillery).2 Batteries British Mountain Artillery.2 Companies Royal Garrison Artillery.Various volunteer detachments. 18 Regiments Indian Cavalry. 7 U- Battalions Indian Infantry.4 Batteries Indian Mountain Artillery.3 Signal Companies.8 Companies Indian Sappers and Miners. 2 Companies Indian Railway Sappers. 5 Regiments Imperial Service Cavalry. 7 Battalions Imperial Service Infantry. 2 Companies Imperial Service Sappers.in place of the above India had received from England :  29 Territorial Batteries. 34 Territorial Battalions.Approximately stated, the number of troops despatched from India up to the summer of 1915, exclusive of drafts to make good wastage, was-60,000 British troops.80,000 Indian troops. .And 330 guns.As regards drafts India had to arrange, so far as the troops sent to France were concerned, for an immediate-reinforcement over and above .war strength of 30 per cent, of Indian ranks as well as for a constant flow of 10 per cent, per mensem of Indian ranks and British officers to the several Exped itionary Forces.As a matter of fact, the excessive casualties incurred by the Indian Army Corps in France and later in Mesopotamia necessitated the despatch of reinforcements on an even larger scale..Apart from personnel India had. been of great assistance to the Empire in furnishing supplies and munitions of war. Practically everything for Forces &quot;B &quot; and &quot;D &quot; had been sent from India, while large quantities of Ammunition, Clothing and Equipment were despatched to Forces &quot;A&quot; and &quot; E &quot; and to the Colonies.HI. Military Operations.Facts and figures from the outbreak of war up to June 1915 have been given separately, as the period prior to that date not only synchronises with Mr. Asquith&apos;s administration before the Coalition Government was formed, but also covers certain definite phases in India&apos;s direct connection with the war, such as the despatch of troops for the expedition to East Africa to protect British interests, the defence of Egypt, the despatch of troops to France, and the invasion of Mesopotamia. In the early days of the war the military resources of Great Britain were described as &quot; contemptible.&quot; The prompt and efficient military assistance of India helped to falsify that description and to save the situation in several theatres of war.Nearly one-third of the whole British Army in France in the winter . of .191.4-15 had been drawn from India, viz., the 27th and 28th British Divisions and the Indian troops, consisting of two Cavalry and two Infantry Divisions. The arrival of the leading Indian Brigades on the Belgian frontier in October 1914 was most opportune. , The timely arrival
IV.-India&apos;s Net Contribution to the Empire in Men andMaterial.The assistance contributed by-India may best be given under several, heads. The figures are by no means complete or final, as they are based on reports furnished up to the autumn of 1916. They include the figures of the first phase (.1914-15).British Officers.On the outbreak of war, as already mentioned, 530 officers of the Army in India who were on leave in England were made over to the War Office for employment with the New Armies or otherwise. Since then, apart from those who accompanied the Expeditionary Forces out cf India, the following-officers have been placed at the disposal of the War Office or sent from India as reinforcements: British Service Officers - 503Indian Army and Indian Army Reserve of Officers     -   1,606making a total of 2,639 British officers drawn from India, apart from those who accompanied their units abroad.On the outbreak of Avar the Indian Army Reserve of Officers consisted of 40 members. It now comprises over 2,240, of whom about 800 are on Field service.&apos;Apart from the Indian Army Reserve of Officers, Commissions have been given in the Indian Army to 271 Cadets from Quetta and Wellington, where military schools corresponding to Sandhurst have been established since 1914.of troops in East Africa, though at first attended with, failure in the field at least protected the British Colony from an invasion which might have been disastrous. The Indian troops were practically the only fully trained soldiers in Egypt, and it fell to them to repel the first Turkish attack on the Suez Canal. The swift and brilliant, stroke which gave us Basra in November 191.4 assured the protection of the installations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan and the oilfields, in which the Admiralty are so largely interested, and probably arrested a Pan-Islamic movement on a large scale throughout Mesopotamia, Persia and Afghanistan, which might easily have developed into &quot;Jehad&quot; on the Indian Frontier. It may justly be asserted that this timely offensive stroke saved India from being-involved in a great war on her own borders, the consequences of which would have been a serious strain on the vital resources of the whole British Empire,Since the summer of 1915 India has played in some respects a subsidiary role in the war. The Indian troops with the exception of five Indian Cavalry Brigades and a Brigade of Mountain Artillery, were withdrawn from France and the Balkans. The conduct of operations in East Africa passed largely into the hands of Generals and troops from South Africa, while the defence of Egypt fell mainly on the troops withdrawn from the Dardanelles and on new formations from England and Australia. On the other hand, the development of the Mesopotamian expedition into an offensive campaign up the Tigris and Euphrates led to a critical change in the military situation in those regions, one which has placed an immense strain on the resources of India, both in men and material. The small Expeditionary Force of two Divisions has grown into a great army of more than 140,000 men. The history of the campaign has been one of alternate success and failure, beginning with the brilliant operations at Nasiriyeh and Kut-el-Amara, and culminating in the pyrrhic victory of Ctesiphon and the retreat on Ivut, the historic defence cf that important strategical point, the lamentable failure to relieve the beleaguered garrison, and the consequent surrender of General Townshend&apos;s gallant Division. British prestige in these regions has now been restored by the rout of the Turkish forces by General Maude and the capture of Baghdad.
The casualties amongst Officers of the Indian Army and Indian ArmyReserve of Officers have been heavy. According to the latest returns they, comprise : Killed or died of wounds and disease - 084Wounded     -          -          .-           - - 857Missing and prisoners of war -        -        - - 187.

Since June 1916 recruits have been coming in at the rate of about 7,000 per mensem.The Burma and Assam Military Police have been increased by 2,300 men in order to provide a flow of drafts for the Army.Thanks to the loyal co-operation of the Nepalese Durbar, 10 Battalions of Nepalese Infantry have been placed at our disposal and have been armed and trained by us for incorporation in the Field Army on the Frontier.Miscellaneous 1 *crsonnel.Apart from the regular combatant units, India has given considerable assistance to the Empire in the shape of non-combatant services. About 2,100 British soldiers have been temporarily transferred to Departments for war purposes.The Supply and Transport Department, which corresponds to the Army Service. Corps, has given about 300 officers and over 600 British ranks for service overseas, while more than 35,000 Indian personnel have been found for Supply and Transport duties.Again, over 350 officers and 1,500 subordinates as well as 6,300 artisans, labourers, and menials, have been sent from India for service with military railways. In this connection it may be mentioned that railways have been constructed, repaired and worked by Indian personnel in East Africa, Aden, and Mesopotamia.India has also enlisted a large number of coolies for employment in Labour Corps, in Mesopotamia, the Dardanelles and elsewhere. Arrange-ments are also now being made for the despatch of Labour Corps to France.Materiel.In addition to the troops a very large quantity of munitions of all sorts such as ammunition, rifles, clothing, military equipment, medical equipment and. stores, railway and engineering plant and supplies of all kinds for man and beast were despatched for the use of the several forces.India&apos;s abnormal output of war material may be gauged by a comparison of the figures for a few items between the years 1913-14 and 1915-16.
: Remounts, Transport, &amp;c.The output of India under these heads has been remarkable. The Remount Department alone has despatched 29,000 horses and ordnance mules, while the number carried overseas of horses, mules, camels, and bullocks for transport purposes exceeds 50,000.Twenty-eight Mule Corps and over 5,000 transport carts represent Indian transport with the several forces. Even mechanical transport has been found to a limited extent by India. About 300 motor and armoured lorries, cars, vans and mobile kitchens have been sent overseas.Shipping.The services of India to the Empire in this respect have been on a notable scale. Since the-outbreak of war close on 200 vessels have been chartered for the conveyance of troops, animals and stores, while nearly 100 steamers, 150 launches and 300 barges have been provided for local use in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. Apart from, the work done for the Royal Navy nearly GOO transports have been fitted or refitted at Bombay. Nine hospital ships have been equipped and manned in India, also six stern-wheelers as hospital river boats and several barges fitted specially for ambulance use have been sent to Mesopotamia. Nearly 100 hospital ships have been repaired or refitted in Bombay. These figures show the heavy work which has fallen on the Indian Marine Department.V. The Present Situation.The course of events described.above has denuded India of the bulk of its troops and has drained off the cream of its armed forces, thus leaving it with the bare minimum required to maintain internal order aud to defend the frontier. It is not too much to say that at the present moment the military security of India rests largely on a well-established military prestige and on the trust reposed in a just and paternal administration.The military forces left in India are not only numerically deficient but also of inferior quality. The British troops are largely composed of Territorial and Garribon Regiments, which naturally are not equal to the old &quot; regulars &quot; withdrawn from India. As regards Indian troops, owing to the constant demands for reinforcements to make good the wastage of war, regiments in. India have been depleted of many of their best men. Some regiments have given from 200-400 men each as drafts for the forces at the seat of war, and in consequence are short of trained soldiers and have an undue pro-portion of recruits and elderly reservists unfit for any strenuous service. They are also very deficient in experienced officers.The Government of India have now undertaken to release 12 Terri-torial Battalions from India for service elsewhere, as&apos; well as to relieve the 13th Division in Mesopotamia by troops from India. They are also arranging to expand three battalions now in Egypt to a strength of six battalions. In place of the above the War Office have engaged to send five more Garrison battalions to India and also to return an Indian battalion from Ceylon.In order to carry out the above engagements the Indian. Government, has had to take steps to embody 1 \ battalions of Volunteers and raise 16. new battalions of Indian Infantry. They have also passed an Act imposing the obligation of military service on the European population.It is unnecessary, to state in detail the exact number of units of all kinds remaining in India, but the aggregate strength of the Army may be taken at about a quarter of a million men, of which nearly one-third are British. In addition to the above, there are about 11,000 Imperial Service troops and 46,000 Volunteers, including Volunteer Reserves. The strength of the Volunteer Force will doubtless be augmented under the recent enactment, but to what extent is not yet known. The question may arise in the course of the Conference whether the troops in India are sufficient
to cope both with Frontier troubles and with the internal situation.   A few remarks on that subject are therefore added.The essential factor from a purely Indian point of view is the defence of the North-West Frontier, for on that largely depends the internal peace of India. On the whole, the position on the Frontier is at present reassuring, but there is undoubtedly a certain amount of unrest, more particularly on the Waziri and Mohmand borders. There are mutteriugs of &quot;Jehad&quot; all along the Afghan marches, and though the Amir is believed to be thoroughly loyal to us, that safeguard, depends on his life. At any moment he may be assassinated or die a natural death, in which case we might expect an upheaval in Afghanistan. Should this occur the whole Frontier might possibly be in a blaze. The imperative necessity for a watchful policy and preparation for instant action is therefore obvious. From the comnience-ment of the war this necessity lias been fully recognised, and Lord Crewe in 1914 authorised the maintenance of three Divisions and a Cavalry Brigade on a mobilised footing in addition to the troops comprising the Independent Brigades at Kohat, Bannu and the Derajat.If Afghanistan should proclaim, war, all the tribes from the Black Mountain to the Takht-i-Suliinan would be up, but they can be, held and defied provided that the Landi Kotal position is occupied in sufficient -force in good time.As regards the other main lines of approach, the line through Bajaur and Swat is securely barred by the strong positions at Chakdara and the Malakand, while the hill country to east and west of the Malakand route can be effectively watched by small columns near Rustam and Shabkadr respec-tively. If the Afridis were to throw in their lot with the Afghans, and thus menace communications with Landi Kotal through the Khaibar, it would be necessary to occupy Bazaar. The other route from the Afridi country down the Dara Valley can be &quot;easily closed by a small column operating from Peshawar.The next line of approach to India is the Kurram. This is effectually closed by snow at the Shutargardan from Christmas till the end of March or often much later. Small columns at Thai, Mi ran Shah, Bannu, and Ton It should be able to deal effectually with raiders from Khost or Waziristan. The Gomal Pass has in the past been frequently utilised as a line of invasion by various Asiatic conquerors, but modern conditions, coupled with our flanking position at Quetta, should preclude the use of this line by any Afghan army at the present time,The next and most southerly line of invasion is that from Kandahar through Quetta. Our position at Quetta, if adequately defended, is one of the strongest imaginable, and a Division is ample to deal with any Afghan and tribal forces likely to attack in this direction, at all events under present conditions.This brief survey of the frontier is incomplete without some remarks regarding Chitral. Chitral would be isolated; the troops there for six months are cut off by snow from both Kashmir and the direct route over the Lowari Pass through Dir. If the Chitralis were so ill-advised as to join in a &quot;Jehad,&quot; the situation for the Chitral garrison would be one of extreme peril, but this is a risk that would have to be taken. It is improbable, how-ever, that the Chitralis would join their hereditary enemies, the Afghans.Apart from a possible Afghan invasion, the only storm centres are the Mohmand country and Waziristau. As regards the Mohmands, a blockade can always be easily established, and much further trouble need not be * anticipated. Waziristan is always a sore spot and petty raids and ambuscades are a constant source of annoyance, but the Waziris are incapable of taking any formidable offensive, though their hostility would doubtless result in locking up troops in the Derajat, Baunu, and Tochi areas. The Afridis have always hitherto been considered a danger, and as they, together with the Orakzais, include a considerable number of well-armed men trained as soldiers in the Indian Army, they doubtless are not to be despised as an enemy; but the very fact that they know our power and their own inability to withstand it in the plains produce a restraining influence.SS 622 F
From Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, Army Department, -&apos; 2Si/i. March 19.17.3157. Indian representatives, Imperial War Cabinet, want to know what additional effort they cau promise on behalf of India on the assumption that Avhilst doing all we can this year, decisive result will not be obtained till next year. The most important consideration is what fighting man-power&quot; can you produce and train to be fit to put into the field in early spring of 1918 in addition to numbers to which you are already committed. This fresh effort would be primarily directed to the relief of British troops now serving in India, Mesopotamia, or Egypt. &apos;   -Even if a &quot; Jehad &quot; were proclaimed, and a wave of fanatical enthusiasm thereby created, it is doubtful, if 100,000 troops aud armed tribesmen could be brought into the field at any one time ; and considering all the advantages that modern scientific equipment, such as aeroplanes, armoured cars, machine guns, and quick-firing artillery gives, the situation may be regarded with equanimity so long as the Indian Army remains loyal. The same remarks apply to the internal defence of India, unless the Nepalese should, recede from their long standing alliance or serious trouble arise on the eastern frontier of Burma. .As regards the Thibet and Yunnan frontier, there is no reasonable probability of trouble. It is true that a very large proportion of the Yunnanese are Mahomedans, but they are ill-armed, unorganised, and have no leaders ; and it is hardly conceivable that the Chinese Government, weak as it is, would permit incursions across the&apos;i&apos;.rontier.The Indian Government can easily cope with internal disorder by itself, but if such should synchronise with Frontier disturbances on a large scale the situation would be serious, especially as it Avould be difficult to send reinforcements of British troops from home, while the Indian Government would no longer be able to continue to send Indian drafts to the army in the field. In any case the difficulty of supplying efficient and adequate drafts to the several Forces and the shortage of trained officers renders the position one of some gravity.This shortage of officers is unquestionably serious. Indian regiments are reduced to four or live regular officers each. The rest are either boys newly joined or Indian Army Reserve, by which term is meant not, as in England, a reserve of ex Army officers, but one of half trained planters, clerks, engineers, and other civilians. The difficulty of providing trained officers for drafts is therefore extreme. In fact, in the matter of officers we are now down to the bone, though India is doing its&apos; best to train young officers at Quetta and Wellington. Besides this about 250 young officers are being-transferred from the British Army, mostly &quot;Territorial,&quot; &quot;Special Reserve,&quot; and &quot; New Army &quot; officers trained at home or in France.The general conclusions which result from this survey are (1) that as regards the safety of India the military situation may be regarded with equanimity save in the case of an Afghan war coupled with a frontier rising on the 1897 scale. In either case it might be necessary&apos;to apply for rein-forcements from England. (2) That, as a base from which to maintain the troops in the field at their present strength, India is sorely strained. (3) That in spite of certain failures and deficiencies the Indian Army has been of great assistance to the Empire in this world, war, and that in France, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere not only has its intervention been opportune, but under most trying conditions it has worthily upheld its fame and prestige. Occasional instances of disloyalty or desertion or faintheartedness have been immeasurably outweighed by the loyalty, devotion, and fortitude of the Indian troops as a whole. India may justly lie proud of her contribution to the Empire, while England has every reason for grateful recognition of her services.India Office, 11th March 1917.
From Viceroy, Army Department, llllt April 1917. (Received 10 a.m., 12th.)4973. Your telegram of the 28th ultimo, 3457. The Government of India cordially welcome all suggestions tending towards development of India&apos;s contributions in personnel in the prosecution of this Avar, with the urgency of which they are fully conversant. As you indicate, the recruiting problem is the dominating factor in relation to the expansion of the Indian Army, hut it would appear from your telegram that you arc not fully aware what has recently been done to readjust and enlarge the machinery which deals with this subject. During the past five months a plan has been drawn up with the concurrence of the Punjab, United Provinces, and Bombay Govern-mcnts, whereby active co-operation of the civil authorities and the assistance of the influential local citizens is being utilised to the fullest extent. The system has not been extended to Madras owing to the prospect of recruiting being so poor in that province. Representatives of the Adjutant-General&apos;s branch have visited the highest civil authorities throughout greater part of India to discuss matters relating to the provision of men and to solicit advice and assistance. Civil representatives of all provinces have assembled at &quot;Delhi and conferences have been held with a view to promoting combination and co-ordination between military and civil authorities. In other parts of the country efforts have been made to tap different classes of society that did not previously find men for army, but the results have not been encouraging. You refer in your telegram to the experiment of Bengal double company and recommend-its large extension. This policy was taken in hand about two months ago. Governor was urged to expand flow of recruiting, lie was recommended to invoke aid of local magnates to encourage recruiting in that province. With a view to progress beyond double company supplied, Bengal was asked to find men for one battalion and a signal company supported by a sufficient quota at the depot to enable these units to keep the field should they be sent on service. There are at present no indications that this demand will be found.   Although we haveBut you may be able to spare or raise units not suitable for use against Turks.   In that case it might be possible to employ them in France.. Do yon think you could, for instance, raise 100,000 men for these objects ? I realise that to do so you will have to resort largely to enlistment of classes that have hitherto not been considered the best for providing lighting men. In particular, I wish you. to consider whether experiment of Bengali double company might not be largely extended. Consider also particularly tho possibility of obtaining more Jats and Mahrattas, but please pass in review all possible resources of India. Present recruiting methods seem capable of considerable improvement, and recruiting organisations would have to be largely expanded. I suggest introduction of some new blood in your recruiting agencies and much more use than has been made up to date of the authority of riding Princes and Chiefs in their States, and of our own civil authorities and local magnates in British India. The unofficial classes should also, I think, be called upon to assist. Perhaps some suitable developments of advertisement agency might also be made use of. You will understand that the necessity for exerting the maximum strength of the Empire is so great that every means that can be devised should be employed, and all possible sources of recruitment thoroughly examined afresh. 1 realise that it may not be possible to make such a large addition to the Army under the conditions on which the Indian soldier now serves. I suggest that you consider whether temporary enlistment for the term of the war might not meet the case; also that as present pay may not be considered sufficiently attractive by classes who have not hitherto provided many fighting men, some form of temporary pay or bonus may be necessary. Please report fully by telegraph what you think could be done. I will then ascertain whether arms and eqniment will be available. I assume that you will be able to draw many officers from Territorials now in India, as you will be able to give them nearly a year&apos;s training.
deemed it advisable to try and secure units from all parts of India, we do not lose sight of the fact that the creation of fresh units from non-fighting races is an innovation which can only be followed to a very restricted degree whilst war is in progress. We have not now a sufficiency in officers and non-commissioned officers to justify our embarking largely in such an experiment which in the case of each unit formed demands a full complement of officers, non-commissioned officers and a proportion of trained private soldiers. Possibility of obtaining more Jats and iVIah-rattas has also been investigated. In the latter case certain difficulties have been experienced which if is hoped are being surmounted, but in a voluntary system of recruiting expectations formed are not always realised. In fact it can be stated that there are practically no classes of Indians who are not taken for some form of service. You recommend, it is noted, that much more use should be made for recruiting purposes of authority of Ruling Chiefs and Princes. Experience does&quot;not offer solid hopes for this source. Units of the Chiefs which are now on service had reached such a -condition of depletion that I felt it necessary to address a letter to each. Chief urging him to stimulate recruitment for their upkeep. With regard to your suggestion that India should raise an additional 100,000 men it will be well that you should understand that we have in contemplation :   (1) Raising of the following additional units, viz., 3 Mountain Batteries, 8 Companies of Sappers and Miners, 4 Divisional Signal Companies, and 23 Battalions of Infantry; (2) Increasing of the establishment of all Indian Infantry Battalions serving overseas to British War Establishment; and (3) Recruitment of the 4,641 gunners and 13,646 drivers plus 1,098 non-commissioned officers demanded in your telegram of the 30th ultimo, 603. The foregoing measures will entail recruitment of 101,453 additional men as an initial step, and the maintenance of a monthly rate of recruits amounting to 17,239 men as compared with an average of 8,095 men a month enlisted during the war, and the monthly average of 1,225 which represented the normal peace requirements of the Indian Army prior to the outbreak of the war. We cannot expect either to raise the additional units and increased&apos;estab-lishments or to maintain the necessary high monthly rate of recruitment given above, under present conditions of pay, and further inducements will be needed which will shortly be discussed in Council. But any extension of cadres in India must be carefully watched in reference to the number of British officers available. Units of the Indian Army must be controlled by officers conversant with the language, habits, aud customs of men they command. The number possessing these qualifications is not unlimited and Mesopotamia forms a heavy drain on. our resources in this regard. In the recent fighting, 88 British officers have been killed, whom we have had to replace. The Territorials in India have not responded as a source of supply to the degree anticipated, and with the prospect of their units being sent out of India we cannot obviously expect that many will care to join the Indian Army. Moreover, no British officer whose experience with Indian troops is limited to a year can be regarded as fully qualified for his position.. You will see from the foregoing that our aims more than anticipate the 100,000 men you mention. We are not at present certain that we shall be able to complete the programme outlined above, but at any rate the substance of this telegram offers proposals of sufficient promise with which Indian delegates can approach Imperial War Conference.^* This word should be &quot; Cabinet.&apos;&quot;
APPENDIX II.MEMORANDUM  ON  THE  ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY   INDIA  IN SUPPLYING COMMODITIES ESSENTIAL TO THE PROSECUTION OP THE AVAILHitherto the value of India as a working member of the Empire has been measured by her contribution in men and money, and the extent to which this country and the Allies are dependent on India for commodities essential for the prosecution of the war is not generally understood, nor is it realised that in many cases India is the sole or main source of supply. It is not too much to say that had the resources of India not been placed at the disposal of the Empire the difficulties of the Avar avouM have been enormously increased it&apos;, indeed, its prosecution on the present scale would have been at all possible.The list of these commodities is a long one, and it has recently been calculated that the value of the Indian exports of direct national import-ance is over ,3,000,000/. monthly, a figure which may reach or even exceed 5,000,000L during the season of heavy wheat shipments. The significance of these figures will be appreciated when it is stated that the total value of Indian exports to all. destinations is roughly 12,000,0001. monthly and to this country 4,000,000LThis adjustment of trade to meet the necessities of the Avar has led to the adoption in India of elaborate measures of State control, not merely in regulating the destination of exports and in providing transport facilities, but in direct State purchase, in fixing prices, in ensuring that adequate supplies are forthcoming, and in stimulating production. In adopting these measures differences in trade methods have made it impossible to follow any uniform&apos; plan, and the schemes of State control and purchase are almost as numerous as the commodities themselves. One day the student of State collectivism will find in these schemes an interesting field of research, but no attempt is made in this memorandum to describe in detail the measures taken. It may, hoAvever, be stated broadly that three guiding principles have been observed. The existing agencies of trade have been utilised; the existing methods of trade have been followed, no attempt being made to devise new trade methods ; and in regulating prices the aim has been on the one hand to meet the demands of the Allied Governments at reasonable rates, and on the other hand to secure a reasonable profit to the Indian producer, so that while profiteering is prevented, production is stimulated.It may be interesting to describe generally and without statistical detail some of the directions in which India has, by her contributions in material, assisted the common cause, it being remembered that this description takes no account of the supplies provided by India to the troops in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and East Africa.Since the outbreak of Avar large and continuous supplies of manganese ore, wolfram, and saltpetre have been removed from India,   All three are of vital importance in the manufacture of munitions, and India is the sole source of supply of manganese ore and saltpetre.   In the case of manganese Manganese ore prices have remained moderate, and no special interference with the ore. trade has been required beyond ensuring that the whole output was reserved for firms manufacturing munitions for the Allies.   With the help of special railway facilities adequate supplies have been maintained, and up to the end of last year over a million tons were shipped.   Of saltpetre practically the Saltpetre. Avhole main production, has been reserved for gunpowder manufacture, and.&apos; the trade is tinder the. strictest control.   Maxima prices have been fixed, but on a scale sufficiently high to stimulate the production of this essential commodity, which it is estimated will this year reach 30,000 tons against 14,500 tons in 1913.In the wolfram mines of Burma the Empire possess an asset of the greatest Wolfram, value, neglected before the Avar when the whole output about 1,700 tons-was exported to Germany ,for the manufacture  of tungsten.   With theSS 022 G
establishment ol tungsten manufacture in England shortly after the outbreak of war the vital importance of the Burma deposits, first worked in 1009, was realised, and it became apparent that the output must be speedily increased. To this end vigorous measures were taken by the Indian. Government. The mining rules were relaxed, efficient working insisted upon, communications were improved and assistance given in the recruitment of labour.The full effect of these measures has not yet been felt, but last year 2,787 tons were exported, while this year the monthly shipments approach 400 tons. When it is remembered that before the war the world production was less than 1.0,000 tons annually, the significance of these figures will be understood. Exports are strictly controlled, and the moderate price of 55s. per unit fixed. Had this not been done, and had there been a free market in wolfram, the price to the British manufacturer would have been many times that figure.In the case of mica and shellac, both widely used in the manufacture of munitions, India is the main source of supply, and special measures have been taken to ensure that national demands are met. The export of high grade mica used in the manufacture of electrical condensers has been prohibited absolutely, and a Government agent has been appointed to supervise the mine owners, and to purchase for Government all high grade mica offered for sale. The shellac market has always been speculative, and recently as prices threatened to become excessive, arrangements were made to ensure that the requirements of the Allies about 50,000 cwt. annually  shall be supplied at a fixed rate considerably beiow the market price. This has been clone by making it a condition precedent to the grant of a license for private export that one-fifth of the amount so licensed shall be sold to Government at the preferential rate.Jute bags. - The consumption of sand bags by the British, French, and Russian Armies is enormous, and in August 1915 the Calcutta jute mills contracted to supply 50,000,000 bags monthly at a price yielding only a small profit on the cost of manufacture. This is roughly two-thirds of the total require-ments, the balance being manufactured at Dundee. From Calcutta alone about 800,000,000 bags have been supplied, and the Public Accounts Com-mittee, reporting in August 191.6, calculated that on the sand bags contracts a saving of 3,000,OOOL had been effected.   Even more favourable are theRaw jute. arrangements made for the purchase of raw jute required by the Dundee mills for the manufacture of these bags. A. group of Calcutta shippers are now supplying the War Office with 00 80,000 tons annually for this purpose at cost price.Hides. For the manufacture of boots, saddlery and accoutrements for the Alliedarmies Indian hides, raw and tanned, have been very largely drawn upon. Last year over 270,000 cwts. of tanned hides of a value of over 2,000,000L were exported to this country providing upper leather for over 3,000,000 pairs of Army boots, while large quantities of raw hides, of a value of over 2,500,0001., were sent to this country and Italy to be tanned. In an agricultural country like India the supply of cowhides is enormous, and has been estimated at 11,000,000 annually, but it has now become apparent &quot; that the whole of the surplus available after meeting the heavy demands of the Indian factories engaged in the manufacture of Army boots, will be required. Arrangements were made some months ago for the purchase of the whole surplus of tanned cowhides at a price which, though reasonable, is sufficiently high to encourage local tanning, and increased quantities are now being shipped. At the moment a more ambitious scheme of State control is being considered. This is the purchase on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s and. the Italian Governments of the whole surplus of raw cowhides estimated at 5,000,000 annually. When this is introduced Indian hides, tanned and untanned, will provide leather for the uppers of 1.2,000,000 pairs of Army boots annually, sufficient for the whole of the British Army and a portion of the Russian and Italian armies.This adjustment of trade will indirectly serve a useful purpose. Before the war, although Indian hides were used in this country, the trade in rawMica. Shellac.
hides was entirely ill German hands and the use of Indian hides had been for some time past abandoned by British tanners. Now that military necessities have driven British tanners to use Indian hides and that British firms have to some extent entered into the raw hide business in India, it may be anticipated that this valuable trade will be diverted permanently from Germany to this country.British tanners have also obtained from India large quantities of tanning Tanning materials, and of myrabolams alone over 40,000 tons were shipped last year materials, to this country.The Indian mills are manufacturing large quantities of Army blankets, Wool, and although, compared with Colonial supplies, the surplus of IndiVs wool that can be sent to this country is small (about 60,000,000 lbs. annually, worth 2,500,000/.). these supplies have proved exceedingly useful. Following the measures taken to acquire the home and colonial clips, arrivals of East Indian&apos; woof are now taken over by Government and distributed at fixed prices.This country depends mainly on India for its supply of oil seeds used Oil Seeds, in the manufacture of glycerine, margarine, and lubricants, and our present security in regard to stocks is largely due to the steady stream of supplies received from this source. Hitherto these supplies have come forward through the ordinary channels of trade, and it has been unnecessary to regulate prices or to set up any system of State purchase. The appointment, however, of a Controller of oils and oil seeds will not improbably be followed in the near future by the establishment of some system of State control of purchase in India.It would be wearisome to examine in detail the quantities of the various oils and oil seeds exported and the uses to which they are put, and it may be sufficient to state that during 20 months (April 1915 November 1916) no less than 700,000 tons of oleaginous produce, of a value of 7,000,000/., were shipped, from India to this country.Since the outbreak of war, India has supplied this country with Wheat. 25,000,000 cwt. of wheat of a value f.o.b. of nearly 1.1,000,000/. &apos; But as India is herself the largest consumer of wheat in the Avorld, it was necessary to regulate&apos; exports very carefully in order that excessive internal prices might be avoided. This control has passed through several phases. In the early months of 1915, stocks were exceedingly low, and although exports were restricted, internal prices became dangerously high. Then followed State purchase on a large scale which lasted until April 1916, and during this period over 10,000,000 cwt. were bought by the Indian Government at prices fixed by them, shipped to this country and sold. These sales realised over 4,500,000/,, yielding a profit of about 160,000/., which will be devoted to agricultural improvements in India. Had the scheme been Avorked on purely commercial lines, larger profits might have been made, but the result may be taken as an indication of the success Avhich attended the endeavour to balance three sets of interests those of the Indian consumer, the Indian producer and this country.On the arrival of the new crop in 1916, private export was reopened Avithin fixed limits of quantity, but with the appointment of the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies, State purchase was resumed, and the Wheat Commissioner in India now purchases on behalf of the Allied GoA^ernments.This year cultivators have been encouraged to increase their Avheat sowings, and. the area sown is expected to reach the record figure of 33,000,000 acres. Given favourable Aveather conditions the outturn will be over 10,000,000 tons and large supplies should be available from May onwards.The Royal Commission has recently taken over the control of rice of Eice. AAdiich India, Avith over 70,000,000 acres under this crop, enjoys almost a monopoly. Now that rice may be diluted Avith Avheat in standard bread, increased quantities of this staple will be needed, and Italy, Avhich in the past has not draAvn on India to any considerable extent, will require large supplies both for dilution with Avheat and for consumption as rice. It is estimated that in 1917 anything up to 800,000 tons may be required by the two countries, and purchase arrangements are now being made.
There have been some indications of speculation since the harvesting of the new crop a month or two ago, and should this endanger the supply at a reasonable price of the quantities required here and in Italy the necessary measures to stop profiteering will be taken without hesitation.In another direction the agricultural resources of India have proved very useful, and to help dollar exchange as well as to economise tonnage Indian maize, grain and barley are now replacing oats from the Argentine and North ximerica as forage for Army horses in Salonica and Italy, purchases on Government account being controlled by the Wheat Corn-missioner to India. As these arrangements have only recently been introduced returns are not available, but it may be taken that, exclusive of the large quantities supplied to Mesopotamia and Egypt, about 40,000  50,000 tons are being shipped monthly to Mediterranean ports.Ordinarily, India imports large quantities of coal from the United Kingdom, Natal, Japan and Australia, mainly as bunkers for steamers leaving Bombay. These supplies are now necessarily restricted, and on India has fallen the burden not only of making good the deficiency, but of providing largely increased quantities to neighbouring coaling stations (Colombo, Singapore and Sebang) for the Admiralty and the mercantile marine. The Australian strike has added to the difficulties, which have only been overcome by the severe restriction of the use of first-class coal by Indian factories and railways.The foregoing account which, as already stated, does not deal Avitli the assistance given in the campaigns in Mesopotamia, Egypt and East Africa, is sufficient to justify the claim that had the agricultural and mineral resources of India not been made available the prosecution of the war in Europe on its present scale would not have been possible, and it is perhaps unnecessary to add to the length of this memorandum by describing in any detail the assistance given in such commodities as teak for the Admiralty, raw silk, hemp and coir, tea for the troops, opium for the manufacture of morphia, rubber, oil cakes, skins and petroleum. While these are of direct national value they do&quot; .not bulk so largely as those already described, and in most cases supplies from other sources are available. But representing as they do an aggregate annual value of over 5,000,000?., they are not unimportant, and in the case of teak and opium India is the only source of supply.India Office, -5th March 1917.
