(This Document fs the Property of &apos; His Britannic Ma]esty&apos;s Government.)   yThe work of the Admiralty Controller&apos;s Department under Anderson, K,B,E,     _____________^ .........ggALTY MOPilDUM H TH7J WAR CABfflET,^HALL C^J^Iu is now a year since Sir Edward Carson d to introduce the Controller&apos;s Organization into the Admiralty, arid although 1 was the first Controller, my time in that position was very short, ard the credit for the great strengthening of our position which has taken place in ships and materiel, is. due to Sir Alan Anderson, who is now relinquishing; the position of Controller, and to his Officers.I feel that the War Cabinet would like to see the attached report of the work of his Depart-ment, as he Irs now handed over the Merchant Shipping si.de to the Controller-General^ and the naval si.de is being handed over to combined Controller and Third Sea Lord.To bring the great industry of shipbuild-ing into order and progress, and. to create a large new out put of na^al munitions, which are in a process of design in many cases, is at no time an easy task;  but under existing conditions it is one of special difficulty    and I think that the great-est possible credit is due to Sir Alan Anderson and the various departmental heads and other offi-cers who have assisted him in giving the results which his report shows.    I feel sure the Cabinet would wish to see his very satisfactory report.ERIC (OPES 8th June, 1918,
6th June., 1918 THE ADMIRALTY CONTROLLER&apos; S -DEPARTMENTI was appointed Admiralty Controller in August 1917, arid I now send yon a record of my 10 months1 term of office.The Admiralty Controller was charged with the materialside of our anti-submarine campaign: he was appointed whencur looses were at their worst, and because of tho crushing weight of th se losses,    He was impartial as between theNavy and the Merchant Service,, and it was his duty to ex-pand our resources and to put them to the best use for allconcerned.The supply of armament and warships for the Navy wasentrusted to him, but his critical duty was to maintain oureffective fleet of merchant shirs for oversea surplv.This does not mean that he had to concentrate uponmerchant shipbuilding.     Our gross output of merchant shipsmostis only one, and not the/important, factor in the problem of maintaining an adequate merchant fleet,The losses from submarines in the quarter which im-mediately preceded my appointment were much too heavy to be met by building merchant ships.     The solution to the pro-blem lay in the offensive and defensive against the submarine. I found no difference between the Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping on this general policy,    . Attack on the submarine, protection and repair of existing ships were given the first call on our resources by the Shipping Controller as freely as by the First Lord,     The building of new merchant ships comes lower in the scale of urgency,and receives only about a quarter of our shipyard effort, measured in manpower.

The number of similar anti-submarine craft under sonstruction in -August 1917.......... 576May 1818.....6.......848The burden of repairs involved by this new Navy is shewn -by the&apos;fact that eleven tim.es the number, but not of course the tonnage, of Naval vessels were repaired and refitted during the last quarter of 1917, compared with the corresponding quarter of 1913 - 3,276 in the latter against 895 in the former period,The Admiralty Controller took complete control of our repair facilities and this control has very greatly increased the effectiveness cf our existing ships,,     I have this year ex-tended our repair organisation to France, Italy and SouthAfrica, and I look forward to great improvement as a result,particularly in the Mediterranean.TANNAGE OF MPJRCM T VESSELS 0QI.1PI.ETED REPAIRS IN UJLWeekly Average during March 1918............,467,822&amp;o do &apos; August l&amp;i?......... ;-....282;289The anti-submarine campaign required new munitions and the creation of a new Navy, which put a great and continuing tax upon the shipbuilding industry.     These light craft hunt the submarine, convoy and keep the sea in all weathers, and their need for repairs is constant and oppressive.Tho completions of anti-submarine craft excluding Destroyers and submarines for four years are:-Displacoment Tons

These figures shew what an economy is theoretically possible, but although the average speed of building will increase it will not approach the speed of the fastest builder,The following table shews this comparison:-(see page 7 over)

O VThese figures do not show the full process that has booi made, as many important branches of production arc quite nowt and have not yet come into bearing.The falling cur\o of losses from submarines shows to wha&quot; good use all...this material has boon put0   The improvement in our position is well shewn by comparing some figures which were given in Parliament in August, 1917, with the actual result.   For reasons given above no absolute estimate should over be given of merchant ship output, and the estimate of output given in Parlia-mcnt was quite out of reach - all the same, the actual result was much better than could have been estimated when I took office, even on the most sanguine basis of output,TONNAGE POSITION.      sTho gross production of merchant tonnage inthe U,Iu, mentioned in the House of Commonsin August for last six months of 1917 was(excluding overseas purchases),............... 1,.090*000On ha sis of losses during previous quarter to30th June 1917 losses during the last sixmonths of 1917 would have beon................ 8,725,000Net forecast of deficiency in six months onHouse of Commons estimate of production,.,..... 1,635,000Actual losses____,. 1,794,336Actual U-X Production,,   667,904............. 1,126.,932Net Improvement of fact over forecaste........These figures show what an advance has been made during my 10 months of office.   In August 1917 we were faced with losses that would soon cripple our oversea supply.    Oat? problem is not yet solved, but we have seen production steadily mounting,, as loss steadily falls, till last month production exceeded war losses as at present known,       I have been equally
concerned to increase production and to decrease loss.I have given figures to snow our material results, tut I cannot show in figures the whole change which has talc on place in the last few months,,Our now department,&apos; with its big programme and constant rapacity for labour and&apos;material, was as welcome to other depart-marts as tho last late comer in a crowded train.   On the material side friendly working relations have been gradually established, and I have no doubt that recent changes in personnel and organisation will bring about a similar improvement in our relations with other departments over labour.   The essential difference between a new department which expands act the rate show in this record and an established department which has passed the peak of/production has never, I think, been fully realised by my colleagues in other departments.With &quot;the shipbuilders also our relations have under-gone a happy change in the last 6 months.   In the well established industry of shipbuilding the active support of the individual shipbuilders is the corner stone of success.   For reasons which I need not explore, some of which date back to the early days of the war, I found the shipbuilders and their men suspicious cf Government interference and resentful of control.   Theatmosphere had changed when I handed ovor merchant shipbuilding, Wo had removed or reduced some causes of friction, and mutualconfidence had boon established.It was not a difficult task, as in all essentials our object were the same as theirs.   I will refer in detail to the . remarkable partnership between Shipbuilding Employers and . Employed, but I hope that every possible indulgence will beshown to this young organisation in its early troubles, and
that with such a good spirit the slxiphuildiiv; industry ma,y show us all the road to industrial control without State interference-
