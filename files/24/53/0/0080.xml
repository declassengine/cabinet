June 1918.SECEET.. f\ NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION--N0. 54.Week ended 1st June, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight and in the northern approach to the North Sea. Dover Straits.On 30th May, at 11.45 a.m., while on patrol from Yarmouth, one of two large America seaplanes in company was forced to come down owing to engine trouble. The other machine stood by for 40 minutes, when she was attacked by two enemy machines, which she drove off. On returning to look for the defective machine she was unable to find her, although search was made for two hours. A message, however, was received from the damaged seaplane, by carrier pigeon, stating that she was being attacked by three enemy seaplanes at 8.50 p.m., but no information as to her fate has been received, and further search for her has been without result.On the same date a large America seaplane on patrol from Killingholme sighted and attacked a Zeppelin, but after an engagement lasting 10 minutes the Zeppelin got out of range.   A second seaplane also gave chase but was unable to get within striking distance.On 31st May the destroyer &quot; Fairy&quot; rammed and sank the enemy submarine U.C. 75 about 12 miles south of Flamboro&apos; Head, but was herself badly damaged and sank shortly afterwards.   Her crew was taken on board the destroyer &quot; Greyhound.&quot;Many reconnaissances and anti-submarine patrols have also been carried out in various areas by R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty.Machines from Dunkirk have, in addition, made the following raids :  Flanders.

Irish Sea.Meditor-ranean.On 30th May a fishing fleet was attacked by an enemy submarine off Dundrum Bay (north-east of Ireland). Five vessels were sunk by gunfire, but their crews reached shore safely. ............................ ................_______On 26th May the transport &quot; Leasowe Castle,&quot; with 3,200 troops on board, was torpedoed and sunk about 100 miles from Alexandria.   The following were the casualties: Crew       ...........       9 (including Captain).13 officers 79 other ranks.TroopsTotal101On 27th May enemy aircraft carried out a raid on Otranto, but no damage was done.On the same date four Allied machines carried out a raid on Durazzo. A direct hit was made on a Destroyer, which capsized and sank. Direct hits were also observed on buildings around the seaplane station, causing fires.   All our machines returned safely.On 28th May seven Allied machines from Otranto carried out a bombing attack on Cattaro ; l\ tons of bombs were dropped, direct hits being observed on the Teodo Dockyard and on the submarine base.  All our machines returned safely.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines During the week under review it is estimated that 10 to 14 large enemy submarines operating, have been operating, two being vessels of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type, of which one has probably just arrived home and the other is reported as having recently attacked American vessels of! the United (States coast south of New York. Of the remaining large boats, one was operating in the neighbourhood.of the Azores but is now homeward bound and another was operating in the Atlantic to the west of the Bay of Biscay. There has this week been an unusual concentration of enemy submarines on the East Coast, six having been located between the Firth of Forth and the Humber. These boats have, however, been unceasingly harried and have achieved little success.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines duringwith enemy recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and also the submarines, number of submarines destroyed or interned: 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		May 11th.

Class, which was sunk by depth charges dropped from an Armed Yacht, and the other a submarine of the U.C. type, which was first damaged by a merchant ship sailing in convoy and was subsequently rammed by one of the escorting Destroyers.

The percentage of losses to sailings in Overseas trades is 2-11 as against no losses last week, in Cross-Channel trades is -28 as against -30, and in Coasting trades is -10 in each of the weeks, while as regards all United Kingdom trades the per-centage is - 94 as against -12 in the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas as well as British, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy in which craft and by mine, classified according to areas. vessels lost.The principal feature of the week is the concentration of enemy submarine activity which has been experienced in the North Sea.   In the Atlantic Southern area also the operations of the enemy have met with more success than usual.The number of British and Foreign Merchant Vessels sailing in organised convoy, yesseis which have completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst convoyed, in such convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods are as follows : 	Weekly average, April, 1918.

ENEMY MINES.Minelaying The week under review has been quiet from an enemy mine-laying point of view, mines having been laid only in the neighbourhood of the Fame Islands and in the Harwich area.During the week a further 19 mines have been swept up in the areas to seaward of Montrose and Peterhead. I,t is believed there are still some 30 mines unaccounted for in these areas.Casualties.

No enemy ships have entered, or left Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.Russia.On 24th May an ordeT wras issued, to the Baltic Fleet that only bluejackets signing contracts may remain with the Fleet, and that none except those signing will be entitled to pay.On 27th May a courier left Moscow for Novorossisk with orders to Admiral Sablin for the immediate destruction of the warships at that poit.It is now fairly certain that only the two dreadnoughts and. 10 destroyers are at Novorossisk, and that the rest of the active fleet (with the exception of the cruiser &quot; Prut,&quot; which is reported to have been taken to Constantinople) are at Sevastopol. When the Germans occupied Sevastopol these ships hoisted the Ukranian Flag, and placed themselves under the protection of. the Ukranian Government, and a Russo-Ukranian Peace Conference sitting at Kief! is to decide their fate.The Germans have demanded that ships at Novorossisk should return to Sevastopol, failing which they would be attacked and seized. The Russians replied that they would disarm the ships at Novorossisk in order to carry out the terms of the Peace Treaty, but at the same time they pointed out that Germany was violating the Treaty by patrolling outside the harbour with submarines, and terrorising the crews by means of seaplanes.There are two Russian gunboats and two despatch vessels in the Caspian Sea. The G.O.C., Mesopotamia, has received instructions to use any means available to obtain control of these vessels and of all steamers which, may be in the Caspian Sea&apos;.&apos;France.r The French torpedo boat destroyer &quot; Temeraire &quot; has been torpedoed and sunk by a submarine. This vessel was of recent construction, with an armament of four 4-inch guns, and a speed of 32 knots. She formed one of a class of four destroyers originally built for the Argentine Navy.
Naval Staff,Qtk June, 1918.[Appendices.Portugal.A report from Lisbon states that the minesweeping service for the Tagus and Dojiro is being maintained in an efficient manner.Spain.Owing to the strong opposition on the part of shipowners, it is believed that the Spanish Government will abandon their scheme for requisitioning the Spanish mercantile fleet.i
