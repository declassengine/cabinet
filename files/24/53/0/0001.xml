RumbokTs weekly reports and to another &quot;sure source &quot; for the information on which this memorandum is based.](i.) Turkish War Aims.ON the eve of the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, the war-aims of the Turkish Government might have been summed up as (i) independence, both in internal affairs and in international relations ; (ii) territorial integrity; and (iii) Turcifi cation. There has been little sign of weakening in these aims during the five months that have elapsed, nor is there likely to be any so long as the Ottoman State can keep itself in being, for the aims are bound up with the existence of the Turkish governing class.The interest of the governing class is the common object underlying- them all; for the governing class is the official class, and independence, integrity, and Turcifica-tion are all means towards securing for Turkish officialdom the widest possible field of opportunity. In a general way they have been the aim of the Ottoman State ever since the State began to decline more than two centuries ago, and they were of course the aims of the dynasty, which was the ruling power in Turkey till 1908. But the dynasty was never touched so directly by failure in these directions as its official servants were. So long as his civil list was not cut down, and he could maintain the traditional pomp and ceremony within the walls of his palaces, the Sultan hardly felt the cession of outlying provinces, the subjection of Ottoman finances or gendarmerie to foreign control, or the rise in wealth and power of the non-Turkish elements in the Empire. Indeed, all these developments might be welcome to him if they tended to confirm his autocratic power in the sphere still left under his control ; and it was just because they realised that the Sultan&apos;s interests were different from theirs, and that theirs were not safe in his hands, that the Turkish official class-military and civil  made the Revolution of 1908For this class the loss of each province meant so many less posts available for its members. Foreign control of branches of the public service threatened to close these branches, or at any rate the highest positions in them, to Ottoman officials, and the decline in status of the Turkish nationality, and particularly of the Turkish language, exposed the Turk to the competition of the abler and better educated non-Turkish peoples Greeks, Armenians, and Syrians-in the administration of the Empire. The Committee of Union and Progress exists to combat these tendencies. It was founded by men of the official class. From an early period of its history, non-Turks were excluded from it by statute, and, after the Revolution, when it came out into the open and established local branches in the provinces, it became a thoroughly representative[367-16] 13
organisation of the Turkish official class, com missioned to control the government of the Ottoman Empire in that class&apos;s interest.The immediate occasion of the Revolution in the summer of 1908 was a belief that the independence, integrity, and Turcification of the Empire were in unusual danger. To secure, restore, or extend them has been the policy of the C.U.P. ever since it has been in power. It was the principal cause of Turkey&apos;s entry into the war a far more important cause than German bribes or the arrival of the &quot; G-oehen. &quot; and the &quot;Breslau&quot; The C.U.P. needed no bribes or coercion to take a step by which they thought that their class interests would bo immensely furthered. They joined in the war to promote their three aims ; they have avowed them in the course of it; and a survey of official pronouncements during the last five months will show that in public, at any rate, they are adhering to them as strongly as ever.(ii.) Recant Turkish Pronouncements oh War Aims.(a.) The Turkish Croion Prince declared, in an interview with the &quot; Vossische Zeitung&quot; at the beginning of January 191.8, during a visit to Berlin : -&quot;We demand, as a condition of peace, territorial integrity and the religious freedom of our Caliphate. We also demand complete liberty for our economic development and a guarantee for the safety of our national religion and culture. We are reorganising our State fabric on European principles. . ...&quot;(b.) Fuad Selim Bey, Turkish Minister at Berne, declared in an interview with the &quot; Bund &quot; on the 13th January last:-&quot; We demand : (1) The integrity of the whole Ottoman territory. We reject even veiled cessions of territory disguised under the names of autonomy or suzerainty. (2) The recognition of our right (which is admitted by the States allied to us) to be our own masters at home, politically and in the economic sphere.   With these terms we stand or fall.....&quot; What applies to Austria-Hungary applies to us. We wish to be masters in our own house, but also to provide a home there for all inhabitants corresponding to the spirit of the age.....&quot;(c) Talaat Pasha declared in an interview with the &quot; Vossisehe Zeitung&quot; on his way through Berlin to Brest-Litovsk :  &quot; The Turkish conditions of peace include the restoration of the pre-warfrontiers.....   If these conditions are not fulfilled Turkey will remain armedto the teeth.&quot;(d). Ilal.il Bey, the new Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared in a speech before the Foreign Affairs Committee of - the Ottoman Parliament on the 6th [?] February last :-&quot;While aware of the great value of peace, we shall never conclude a peace at any price. . . .&quot; The fate of national groups which were not independent before the war cannot be regulated otherwise than by institutions created in accordance with the constitution of each individual country. ...&quot;He rejected all proposals, from whatever quarter, which would mean any interference in the internal affairs of the country, and declared himself in complete accord with Count Hertling&apos;s and Count Czernin&apos;s replies to Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson.(e.) Talaat Pasha declared in an interview with the Vienna correspondent of the &quot; Vossische Zeitung &quot; about the .14th February last:  &quot;If President Wilson will renounce intervention in the internal affairs of Turkey, then, perhaps, a way to peace negotiations can be found. But as things stand, Turkey, as a State composed of many nationalities, must decline every offer of intervention, just as Austria-Hungary has done.&quot;
(/.)&apos; Talaat Pasha declared in an interview with the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; about the same date : &quot;President Wilson&apos;s speech offers the possibility of further development on condition that, in regard to Turkey, for example, certain principles are maintained, especially that of preserving her territorial integrity and her unrestricted sovereignty.&quot; Mr. Lloyd c!eorge&apos;s speech, on the other hand, does not admit the possibility of discussion-especially in regard to his comparison of Belgium with Syria, Mesopotamia, and Arabia. It cannot be doubted that these regions are vital component parts of Turkey. The preservation of her possessions is a vital necessity for Turkey.&quot;(g.) From a confidential source, dated the 18th April, 191.8, it is reported that Talaat Pasha appears still to be in favour of carrying on the war to the bitter end. He protests emphatically against the &quot; pretensions &quot; of the British Government in Palestine and Mesopotamia, and declares that Turkey will continue to fight so long as the British remain on Turkish territory.(iii.) The Ascendancy of Nationalism.In the pronouncements quoted above there is doubtless an element of bluff, but the definiteness and, above all, the consistency of the views put forward by different representatives of the Turkish Government points to the likelihood of their being held seriously in the&apos;main.The strongest note is the rejection of any compromise regarding the non-Turkish nationalities. The grant of autonomy is refused as emphatically as outright cessions of territory. Both Talaat and the Minister at Berne equate the Turkish standpoint in this respect with that of Austria-Hungary, and the same attitude appears in the concrete cases that have lately arisen.For example, since the British Governments declaration about a national home for the Jews in Palestine, it has been of urgent importance for Turkey and her allies to retain Jewish sympathies, and with this object Talaat gave an interview to the Constantinople correspondent of the &quot; Vossische Zeitung &quot; at the beginning of last January. Yet in this interview he boasted of the advantages which the Jews already enjoyed under Turkish rule, repeated several times over that they could be given no privileges above other Ottoman citizens, and ended up with nothing more substantial than a promise that they would benefit by the forthcoming general municipal statute for the Ottoman Empire.A few days later, in an interview with the &quot; Lokal-Anzeiger,&quot; he professed &quot; an unshakeable belief that the whole of Palestine would remain under Turkish sovereignty,&quot; and added that, &quot; so soon as Jerusalem was again in Turkish hands,&quot; the Jews and Christians would see their problems regulated to&apos;their satisfaction.Against this there is nothing to set, except a reported statement by the Turkish Minister at Berne towards the end of February that &quot; autonomy will be granted to Palestine under Turkish suzerainty, so that contact with Egypt may be maintained &quot;  an extremely ambiguous pronouncement.This attitude of no compromise is still more evident in the case of Armenia, for the Moslem element in Turkish Armenia is largely Turkish-speaking, and Turkish officialdom appears to regard the country as its patrimony in a more intimate sense than, for example, the Arab.provinces. It is true that Javid Bey, in an interview with the Budapest &quot; Az Est &quot; towards the end of December 1917, talked of &quot; special treat-: ment after the war for the Arab and Armenian districts, which have suffered especially during it&quot;; and at the end of April 1918, after the reconquest of the occupied territory in the north-east, it was rumoured that the Turkish Government were preparing a general amnesty &quot; for all peaceful Armenians,&quot; to be followed by their repatriation. But the ulterior object of this was probably to prevent the surviving Armenian exiles in the Mosul district and the Hauran from being rescued by the British forces, and there is no trace of any genuine concessions. In the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the unconditional and immediate evacuation of the Turkish-Armenian districts occupied by Russia was . insisted on, and when Javid Bey, in his Budget speech on the 21st February, 1918, introduced, an additional estimate for the repatriation of Moslem refugees, he received vehement applause.Turkish nationalism is also rampant in the economic sphere. The plundering cd the Armenians and Greeks, the inflation of the paper currency, and the attraction of
new money into the country through purchases made by the Central Powers has momentarily placed capital in Turkish hands. There is a fever of company promoting by Turks, especially in the towns of Anatolia, and much complacent talk of a new national Turkish bourgeoisie. A financial crash is probably inevitable, but for the moment Turkish nationalism is stimulated by the illusion of economic self-sufficiency, and Javid Bey proposes to raise an internal loan of   T. 40,000,000 during the coming financial year* (though he was careful to add in his speech that if this sum were not raised the deficit would be lent by Germany).There is a movement, too, for building up a national merchant marine-this in connection with the ambition of making the Black Sea a &quot;Turkish Lake&quot; and the question of the Black Sea Straits is regarded as settled in the sense of Turkey&apos;s complete sovereignty by the treaties with the Ukraine and Russia. Finally, the Turco-Geiman Conventions replacing the Capitulations (which have been balm to Turkish pride, though the advantages obtained by them are largely illusory) have been supplemented by a similar series of conventions with Austria and Hungary ; and it was reported in January that the Swiss and Dutch Governments were negotiating with Turkey for the extension of the rights secured to Germans under the new conventions to their own nationals, at any rate for the period of the war.Altogether, the Turkish official class, far from despairing of its war-aims, believes itself, since the peace with Russia, to be on the road to their realisation-so much so that it has raised its demands from mere &quot; territorial integrity &quot; to &quot; dis-annexation.&quot;(iv.) Demands for &quot; Dis-Annexation.&quot;The concept of &quot; Dis-annexation &quot; is characteristic of the policy of the Turkish official class. The Ottoman Empire, like the Hapsburg Monarchy, is an artificial State held together by force, and must therefore base its title to sovereignty not on grounds of national unity or the consent of the governed but on the right of conquest. When a State of this kind is on its decline, the right of conquest becomes the prescriptive right of possession, and the Turkish claims to &quot; territorial integrity &quot; and to the &quot; dis-annexation &quot; of territories already lost before the present war are both based on this idea. Turkey has never, indeed, abandoned the ambition, inherited from her conquering days, to be a Moslem world power; it has survived in her pretension to the Caliphate, and reappeared since the Russian breakdowu in her policy towards Persia and the Moslems of the Russian Empire.f It is reported, for instance, that when the signature of peace at Brest-Litovsk was announced in the Ottoman Parliament on 6th March, a deputy criticised the Government for failing to secure guarantees for the Moslems in Russia such as Germany had obtained for Livonia, Esthonia, and Finland, to which Enver replied that Turkey would recognise and support autonomous Governments set up in the Caucasus or in other regions adjoining the Ottoman frontiers. But, on the whole, the Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turanian movements seem to have comparatively little root in Turkish sentiment. They are effective weapons for ensuring the disruption of Russia and for embarrassing Great Britain, but the Turkish official class evidently cares far more for retaining or recovering old Ottoman provinces than for extending its power over other Turkish or Moslem lands.The following claims to &quot;dis-annexation&quot; have been raised by the Turkish Government during the last five months : (a.) To the trans-Caucasian districts of Batum, Kars, and Ardahan. These districts were ceded to Russia in 1878 in part settlement of a war indemnity. In the final draft of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Russia renounced her sovereignty over them, and their destiny was left to be settled by the inhabitants in conjunction with the neighbouring members of the Quadruple Alliance. Turkey has since occupied these districts by force.(b.) To the disputed frontier districts of Maku and Kotur, in the Persian Province of Azerbaijan. The old claim to these districts is reported to have been revived last March in the Turkish press. In April they were occupied by Turkish troops, and detachments have since arrived at Tabriz. The Persian Government fears that Turkey may claim the whole province of Azerbaijan, which she held at periods during the 16th and 17th centuries, and has always coveted; but there is no evidence for this at present.* Entente nationals with businesses in Turkey are apparently to be incited to subscribe their bank credits, an amazing proposition when it is remembered that the coupoua on this loan are to be paid in gold, t Discussed in a previous memorandum on Moslem countries, No. 001.
(c.) To the territory west of the River Maritza in Thrace, ceded to Bulgaria in the autumn of 1915, and to further territory in Western Thrace, including Dedeagatch and Gumuijina, and extending to the Rivers Arda and Karasu, which was ceded to Bulgaria after Jie Haitian war m 1913. Turkey claimed these territories as compensation for the acquisition of the Dobruja by Bulgaria. Bulgaria vehemently opposed this claim, but Turkey would not give way, and the question is perhaps still ^ unsettled. In April there were rumours in the German press that Turkey had been offered the Crimea in lieu of Gumuijina, but this is reported to be untrue.(d.) To Egypt-Tho Turkish claim to Egypt on grounds of historical right was more or less dropped after the failure of the attacks on the Canal. It is all the more significant that it has been revived of late, in spite of the British advance in Palestine. In the session of the Ottoman Parliament in which the Peace of Brest-Litovsk was ratified, Halil Bey, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, made a formal protest against the British occupation; and the Turkish Minister at Berne is reported to have remarked in conversation, early in March, that Germany had signed an agreement with Turkey not to make peace until England gave up Egypt which would then be restored to independence under Turkish suzeranity.These claims to dis-annexation, as has been suggested above, are rather extensions of the principle of k&apos; territorial integrity,&quot; arising out of the breakdown of Russia, than ambitions for new expansion. At the same time, they indicate a surprising confidence in Turkish prospects, in view of the large and increasing area of Ottoman territory under British occupation. This confidence is based on the prestige of Germany, with, which it will stand or fall.(v.) The State of German Prestige.Since the fall of Bagdad and the establishment of a British army in Palestine, the Turks have virtually admitted that they cannot reconquer the territories under British&apos; occupation by themselves, and have had to look for their recovery to Germany.This situation has gradually created serious friction between the two Governments. The Turks have not so much doubted Germany&apos;s ability to recover their territories for them the impression made upon them by her immense conquests in Europe and by her apparent military superiority over her opponents could not easily be effaced but they have more and more doubted her goodwill. The Turks naturally demanded that German troops* should be despatched to the Palestine and Mesopotamian fronts at an early date and in sufficient numbers to drive the British over the frontier. The&apos; German staff, however, was determined to spend as little as possible of its resources in Turkey ; it was bent first upon the disintegration of the Russian army, and then upon a military decision on the Western front, and it was the task of German diplomacy to explain this to the Turkish Government, and to convince them that Palestine and Mesopotamia would be recovered, not at once or by local operations, but by a decisive victory at the favourable moment in France.As time passed and the British advance continued, German credit in Turkey was put to a constantly severer strain. The .Kaiser&apos;s visit to Constantinople in October 1917 marked a critical moment. On this occasion he is said to have guaranteed to the Sultan that Turkey should retain her complete independence and integrity, that her allies would do their utmost to recover her lost territories for her, that the Sultan should retain the Caliphate, and that Armenia and Arabia should be dealt with by the Ottoman Government at its discretion.The period between the fall of Jerusalem and the conclusion of peace with Russia saw the lowest ebb of Turkish moral. It was known that the Pope was opposed to the return of Jerusalem to Moslem rule, and it was apparently believed in Turkish official circles that, in deference to clerical influences, the Central Governments had begun secretly to work against the re-establishment of Turkish sovereignty. It was reported last January that Talaat, in conversation with General Liman von Sanders at Constantinople, had hinted his suspicion of this, whereupon von Sanders telegraphed to Hindenburg, and Hindenburg made the Kaiser send an autograph letter to Enver, promising that Ottoman soil should soon be cleared of enemy troops. Copies of this letter were placarded, it is said, in the streets of Constantinople.There is another report to the effect that Selim Fuad Bey, Turkish Minister at Berne, was instructed about the same date to insert articles threatening the defection* When Bagdad fell there were actually Turkish divisions serving on the Dobrudja, Galicia, and Riga fronts. The difficulty of securing the return of these troops to Asia considerably increased the Turks&apos; resentment.1367-16] C   &apos;f    ; I
of Turkey in the Swiss Press. Simultaneously, a memorandum was presented to the German Ambassador at Constantinople stating that Germany&apos;s delay in sending troops to Palestine was &quot; having a disastrous effect in Turkey upon public opinion and in the army,&quot; and that a military revolt and the overthrow of the Government were not impossible. In response to this, it is declared, von Kuhlmaim confirmed certain earlier verbal assurances by an answering memorandum, stating that &quot; Germany would not fail at the proper moment and that in the near future--to lend Turkey the necessary military aid to expel the British from Palestine and Jerusalem, and that in any case the return of Palestine and Jerusalem would be made a fundamental condition of the evacuation of Belgium.&quot;During the Brest-Litovsk negotiations the Turks were evidently sceptical of Germany&apos;s intention to support Turkish aims, and still more of her ability to bring about a general settlement. About the end of January Turkish officials, in Switzerland and elsewhere, were talking freely of making the best terms they could with the Entente about the occupied territories if Germany failed them in these respects. u Turkey could not continue the war for such questions as Alsace-Lorraine; &quot; &quot; if the Germans wished to continue the war, they must use their own troops to fight the British ; &quot; and so on. Half-way through February, when Talaat was on the way home from Berlin and Brest-Litovsk, his relations with Kuhlmann were reported to be very strained indeed. He had demanded, it was said, at least 300,000 troops to drive the British out of Turkish Territory, but had received no assurance of obtaining them. He was openly accusing the Germans of betraying Turkey, and was declaring that there was no longer any hope of saving Palestine and Mesopotamia.The peace with Russia, when it came, seems to have taken the Turks (or, at any rate, the Turkish press,) by surprise. The overthrow of the Power which had been Turkey&apos;s most formidable enemy for the last century and a half, and the dis-annexa-tions in Trans-Caucasia which were added as an afterthought to the final draft of the treaty, naturally caused satisfaction, and the belief in Germany&apos;s military power was confirmed. This has doubtless been still further enhanced by the Western offensive, but we have no information yet as to how Turkish opinion has been affected by the pause, and already, at the beginning of April, Suleiman Nazif Bey, an important member of the C.U.P., was saying that, if the offensive did not bring a general peace, Turkey would be obliged to come to terms with the Allies. This doubt about the prospects of the offensive in Turkish official circles is confirmed from another source, with the addition that &quot; Turkey would not be much better off, even if the Western offensive succeeded.&quot; Such reports emphasise the weak point in the Brest-Litovsk peace from the Turkish point of view ; it neither recovered Mesopotamia and Palestine directly, nor produced that general decision from which their recovery would incident-ally follow, and towards the end of April the Turkish Ambassador at Vienna was rumoured to be speaking just as freely about the omission of the Germans to send military help to Palestine as Talaat had spoken in February.The participation of German troops in the operations east of Jordan, which have twice resulted in the withdrawal of the British forces to the west bank of the river, may have somewhat pacified this feeling, but the German activity in Palestine has produced new causes of tension. Whatever may have been the truth about clerical influences in the counsels of the Central Governments, there is no doubt that Germany is making every effort to conciliate the Jews, who even in Germany and Austro-Hungary have been drawn towards the Entente by Entente policy with regard to Zionism ; she has put pressure on the Turkish Government to come into line, and the Turks have not taken it in good part. At the end of April there seems even to have been a rumour afoot in Turkish circles that, whereas Germany had always hitherto declared that the fate of Palestine would be decided on the Western front, she was now thinking of reconquering the country by a local campaign with German troops, and of &quot;establishing an independent State under Turkish suzerainty, but under German-Jewish management&quot; a solution that would stink in the nostrils of Turkish officialdom.Falkenhayn, too, during his Syrian command seems to have quarrelled not only with Jemal, but with all four provincial Governors the Valis of Aleppo, Beirut, and Damascus, and the Mutesarrif of the Lebanon. Falkenhayn insisted on taking over the whole control of civil and military supplies. The Turkish officials regarded this as an encroachment upon their functions ; and when they could secure neither a decision in their favour nor the acceptance of their resignations, they are said to have secretly incited the population to resist the German measures.No doubt the Valis&apos; control of supplies was corrupt, but Turkish officials regard
corrupt gains from their functions as their perquisite, and Germany is on the horns of ii dilemma. She must either allow Turkish official corruption to imperil the joint prosecution of the war or, by taking steps against it, she must wound and that on their tenderest point---the susceptibilities of the class in Turkey whose good-will is essential to Tureo-German co-operation. For a long time Germany confined herself to argument and conciliation. In February, for instance, it was reported that Talaat, Javid (Minis;er of Finance), Ismail Hakki (Food Controller), Panjeli Bey (ex-director of the Ottoman Bank), the Ambassadors at Berlin and Vienna, and other prominent Turks had been attending conferences at. Berlin on the Turkish economic situation. But since then, if reports arc true, the Germans have been forced to adopt a harsher method. Early in May they are said to have told Enver that if he did not moderate his peculations he would produce a revolt in the Turkish army and a split in the ( MI.P. &apos; a step which is said to.have been taken by Enver in. very 1 ad part. And later in the month they appear to have sent a virtual ultimatum to Ismail Hakki, threatening to withhold the Turkish share of the food supplies from the Ukraine unless Hakki guaranteed that he would distribute the foodstuffs equitably without the intervention of the profiteers in the C.U.P.These invidious reprimands must have vastly diminished Germany&apos;s popularity with the Turkish official class, which more fortunate than the corresponding classes among Turkey &apos;s allies-can oppress the masses to any extent without apparent danger of revolution.* But the masses, too, are becoming more and more anti-German. The Greeks and Armenians believe that the Germans are responsible for the massacres; and the Moslems, in their ignorance and fanaticism, find relief for their present misery in hatred of the German unbeliever, without perceiving that he is doing them the best possible service by attempting to check the abuses of the C.U.P. At the beginning of April a neutral resident in. Constantinople, who had just left Turkey, stated that the Germans were execrated there; and towards the end of April it was reported that the anti-German movement was being led by the ulema and hojas. A few months before the use of the word &quot;Giaur&quot; bad been punished by. the police, but recently the phrase V Alleman-Giaur&quot; was audible in the streets in the peopled conversation.(vi.) Symptoms of &quot;Defeatism.&quot;This tension in Turco-German relations, continuing and growing more acute for over a year, has produced symptoms of &quot;defeatism,&quot; or desire to get out of the war without counting the cost, on the Turkish side.Last January Mahmud Mukhtar Pasha, late Turkish Ambassador at Berlin, stated that the Ottoman Government were preparing public opinion for the announcement that autonomy was to be granted to Palestine; and he added, in conversation with another interlocutor, thatmArabia and Mesopotamia would have to be given autonomy too, and that the Turkish policy towards the Arabs had been folly. In February Dr. Lutfi Bey declared that the Turks were getting used to the idea of losing a province or two permanently. Taiaat&apos;s expression of pessimism about the occupied territories during the same month, in connection with his resentment against Germany, has been referred to already. At the beginning of March a Turkish deputy and a leading Turkish journalist on a visit to a neutral country agreed that the Turkish Government had reconciled themselves to the loss of Palestine completely. In April it. was reported that the Turks were much impressed by the cutting of the Hejaz Railway and the arriv-al of British troops at Ana. The recovery of Bagdad was despaired of, and the British position on the Jebel Hamrin regarded as impregnable. This impression must have been deepened by the recent advance to the Lesser Zab, and what is more important the informant declared that the Turks were feeling that, the British pressure was preventing them from reaping the fruits of the collapse of Russia,and expanding quietly towards the north-east. Talaat, he said, was set upon peace now that the Russian menace was disposed of, and he, the informant (being an Ottoman senator), had told Talaat that Syria and Palestine were lost to Turkey for over. Finally, a neutral resident in Turkey has stated that &quot; the fact that there are Arabs fighting with the English against the Turks is regarded as almost too&apos; painful to be mentioned,&quot; and that &quot;it is felt that the English have struck Turkey on a very tender point.&quot;* The Ami rican Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief has calculated that a quarter of the population of Turkey may have perished from massacre, disease, starvation, and Casualties during the war. A Government that can survive this can practically disregard the factor uf internal opposition.[367- 16J D
T iose seem to be genuine signs of discouragement; but against them must be set the reiteration of the Turkish war-aims of independence and integrity, and Talaat s never-endian &quot; mood in April, recorded above Defeatism in Turkish official circli s is counteracted by powerful considerations the fact that Turkish war aims are identical with the private interests of the Turkish governing class, the profit which members of this class are making our, of the war, their practical immunity from the danger of a revolution, and their almost unshaken faith in an ultimate military decision in Gei&apos;nmny&apos;s favour. The resentment at Germany&apos;s procrastination, in relieving the local military situation on the Turkish fronts, strong though it has been, has not availed to carry &quot;defeatism &quot; into the ascendant. But it has produced one important result -a rift in the (?.(:.?.(vii.) The Rift in the O.U.P.During the past five months there have been growing rumours of political dissension in Turkey, but they need careful analysis. Movements to overthrow the O.U.P. altogether must be distinguished from movements within the C.U.P. to replace the present Government, though not necessarily the entire personnel of it, by other members of the Committee. And in estimating the importance of internal factions the possibility must always be reckoned with that Government and &quot; Opposition &quot; may be acting in collusion. Furthermore, it is difficult to exaggerate the part played in Turkish politics by personal motives, and it must not therefore be assumed too readily that a change of persons will involve a change of policy.To begin with the opposition touthe C.U.P. from outside, there is evidence of it from two quarters--from the Turkish &quot; Liberals &quot; in exile at Paris and Geneva (who maybe dismissed herewith, as they have not the slightest prosrject of coming into power), and from the officers.in the.army.There is considerable evidence that the discontent among the officers is serious, and Mukhtar Bey, a member of the Turkish Prisoners-of-War Commission which negotiated with British representatives at Berne, declared last January that the aim of the.-movement was a separate peace;* On the other hand, the Turkish military attache in Switzerland declared that it was merely bluff with the object of putting pressure on Germany to send military help ; and this is borne out by the memorandum, alluded to above, which was handed by the Turkish Government to the German Ambassador at Constantinople about the same date, and in which Germany&apos;s procrastination was described as &quot; having a disastrous effect on the army.&quot; On the whole, however, it, is probable that the Government were exploiting a movement that was genuine in itself. At the beginning of April the Commanders of the Second and Third Army Corps were reported to have joined it, and the C.U.P. were said to have organised a body-guard of 4,000 to hold Constantinople in case of a military erneute. Presumably the bulk of the malcontents belong to the junior ranks, and the question arises; Do these feel a solidarity of class interest with the ruling clique of the C.U.P. ? If they dp, the over-throw of the C.U.P. by them (an unlikely event at the best), would not bring any change of policy. But it is just possible that the scandalous corruption of the older gang during the war may have produced a real schism in Turkish officialdom, and that the younger officers may feel towards Enver and Talaat in 1018 as these and their contemporaries felt towards Abdul flam id and his entourage in 1008.The malcontents have a possible leader in a certain Colonel Kemal Bey, who is said to have saved the situation for the Turks at Suvla Bay, and to have been retired, out of jealousy, by Enver. There is reported to be resentment in the army at the way he has been treated, and he is rumoured to have a considerable following. There is also said to be special discontent among the officers at Smyrna, and this is significant in view of the character and policy of Rahrni Bey, who during the period of the war has been Yali of Aiding Rahmi Bey has always taken a strong line of his own. In 1915 he would not carry out the Government instructions for exterminating the Armenians. He has left the Entente nationals in his province at large there is, of course, an important foreign colony at Smyrna and allowed them to carry on their businesses. And the economic conditions in Aidin though this is no doubt largely due to the natural richness of the country are notoriously better than at Constanti-nople.   Rahmi is evidently too powerful for the Government to attack him, and in* A new opposition parly, supported by officers, and aiming at a separate peace, was also reported from two sources in December. It was said to include 120 Deputies in the Turkish Parliament, under the leadership of Husein Jahid and Nejm-ed-din Mollah.   But nothing- further has been heard of this group.f The Smyrna Province.
April it was rumoured that certain (unnamed) members of the CD.P. hoped to make him an intermediary for negotiations with Great Britain. They were said, however, to be acting only half-heartedly for fear of his growing power. Yet it is doubtful whether he has great influence beyond his province, and though he has been humane and conciliatory in his administration, there is no evidence whatever that his war-aims differ from those of his class. At the same time, Rahmi, as a strong character and the possible leader of a party,, is a factor that must be borne in mind.To turn to the dissension within the C.U.P., it seems to gather round three personalities : Enver Pasha, Fethy Bey, and Shukri.The trouble with Enver is of old standing. Outwardly it takes the form of rivalry with Talaat-in April, for example, there was a quarrel between them as to whether a soldier or a civilian should be made Ambassador ,at Berlin-but evidently Talaat has behind him the Executive of the O.JJ.P., who resent Enver&apos;s inordinately shameless and lucrative peculations, and consider that he, is betraying the interests of his class to Germany in order to further his personal career. About the beginning of January there was a very serious scene between Enver a,nd&apos;Kemal Bey, the Secretary of the Committee,* over the question of Turkish reinforcements demanded by Germany for the Salonika front; and there seems to have been an-attempt;,to assassina e Enver in February though the motives of the plot were apparently purely personal and went back to a long-standing feud. Possibly EnveFs colleagues suspect that he might become an instrument for the imposition of German control upon Turkey ; but the Germans probably do not consider Enver&apos;s services worth the unpopularity&apos;he has aroused, and this may be the explanation of the German remonstrance to him in May, which has been mentioned above. Enver may have returned to the bosom of the CUP. in consequence of this rebuff. Already in April, after Talaat&apos;s return from Berlin and BrestrLitovsk, it was reported that a reconciliation had&apos; been effected at a secret meeting of the C.U. P. Executive, as thp result, of an emotional speech by Haljl Bey, who has come into sudden prominence since he succeeded Nessimy Bey as Minister for Foreign Affairs.The other elements of opposition are of more recent appearance. Fethy Bey, -the&quot; leader of one opposition group, was Turkish-Minister at Sofia during 1917, and was only elected a deputy, as one of the members for Constantinople, in December last. In March Fethy made a violent attack on the&apos; Government in Parliament for countenancing the food profiteers, to which the Government made no reply. But another report referring to the same (or possibly to aTater) debate states that the attack was directed specifically against Enver, that the responsibility for the speculation in foodstuffs Avas attributed to him, and that a demand was made, not for the dismissal of the Government but for its reconstruction. It is-added that, after a long debate, it was decided to make no change till the war was over. This bears out the view, which is put forward by almost all informants, that Fethy has been acting in collusion with lalaat from the beginning, and that his &quot; opposition party &quot; is merely a device of Talaat and the C.U.P. Executive for overthrowing Enver, or at any rate shaking his position.   If this is true, Fethy&apos;s movement must be dismissed as of no: account.On the other hand, Shukri Bey&apos;s opposition seems to be genuine. Shukri was Minister of Education in 1917, in which capacity he made a tour of inspection in Germany during the summer. In September he was apparently elected General Secretary of the C.U.P.,&quot;p but in December he suddenly resigned his portfolio. It appears that he was selling various economic rights to nationals of the Central Empires, and was also embezzling a sum of   T. 500,000 assigned for the education of soldiers&apos; orphans. The War Office (or, in other words, Enver), hearing of this, instructed Javid Bey, the Minister of Finance, to call for Shukri&apos;s accounts. Shukri produced none and resigned, but he retaliated by demanding that Enver should produce his  an act of which Enver was, of course, equally incapable. Out of revenge, Shukri went into opposition, and has set himself to do the maximum injury to all groups in office.Early in February it was reported that Shukri, Dr. Nazim, Jemal, and Beha-ecl-din-Shakir (the pan-Islamist) were acting together, and that they had had &quot; a heart-to-heart talk &quot; with the Government on two subjects the failure to obtain German reinforcements for the Palestine and Mesopotamian fronts, and the economic misery in the interior. The Government, it was added, &quot; could give no assurances and offered to resign,&quot; but &quot;the party&quot; rejected this, and insisted that the men who had made the situation must mend it. This report evidently emanates from Slrukrfs camp, for it contains the incidental statement that Shukri really resigned because &quot; he did not wish* Not to be confused with Oolouel Kemal Bey. t Unless this Shukri is another individual.
to share the responsibility of the Government when the break-up comes &quot; a statement which is obviously a very one-sided account of the matter. But ShukrPs activities are certainly to be taken seriously. In March ho wai3 reported to be gathering adherents,, and by April he had started a newspaper at Constantinople.In this three-cornered duel between Shnkri, Enver, and Talaat the position of&apos; Jemal Pasha is difficult to define. When Talaat went to Brest-Litovsk, Jemal acted in his absence as Minister of the Interior -an indication that the two were working together. On the other hand, his adhesion to Shukri&apos;s party is claimed in the report quoted above, and JemaPs wife stated in April that Shukri hoped to persuade Jemal to join him. In April, too, bills .were surreptitiously posted up in Constantinople, demanding the resignation of the Government and the appointment of Jemal as Grand Vizier. Conceivably this was a move in Shukri&apos;s campaign, for such evidence as there is gives the impression that Jemal is being used as a stalking-horse by other people. At the beginning of May, for instance, the Germans were said to be encouraging him as an oil-set to Enver. Shukri has no doubt conceived the same idea, Jemal evidently retains a certain reputation, but his career as an independent politician of the first rank probably ended with his Syrian Command, and even his wife admitted that he had at present very few followers.The question remains : What is Shukri&apos;s attitude towards war-aims? In April it was reported that his party, if successful in overthrowing the Government, hoped to negotiate with the Allies; and in March a Turkish journalist, who&quot; has since been mentioned in connection with Shukri&apos;s new newspaper, came to a neutral country to spy out the land and talked there in a &quot; defeaiist&quot; tone. Certainly a blackguard like Shukri is more likely to betray his class and nationality than a man of honour like Rahmi Bey, and ShukrPs energy is unquestionable. But even supposing he wishes eventually to negotiate with us on a &quot; defeatist &quot; basis, will he obtain the necessary backing in Turkish official circles ? The fact remains that the present Governments war-aims of territorial integrity, internal independence, and Turcification are expressions of the corporate interests of Turkish officialdom, and it is difficult to believe that factiousness towards colleagues or resentment against Germany will induce any considerable section of the governing class to throw these interests over. At the same time, Shukri Bey&apos;s opposition does very seriously embarrass the position of the Government, more seriously than any previous political event in Turkey during the war, and is therefore an advantage to the Allies as a disintegrating force, though not, perhaps, as a direct means towards peace with Turkey on the Allies&apos; terms.(viii.) Conclusions.1. The Turkish Governments war aims integrity, independence, and Turcifica-tion are identical with the interests of the Turkish official class, which has been the real sovereign of the Ottoman Empire since 1908. During the last five months the Government has proclaimed these aims as loudly as ever, and there has been an increase in chauvinism, both political and economic. Since the breakdown of Russia, for instance, the principle of &quot; integrity &quot; has been expanded into &quot; dis-annexation.&quot;2. The steady British advance has not sobered this temper, because the Turkish belief in an ultimate military decision in Germany&apos;s favour still persists. On the other hand, the Turks have become exceedingly doubtful of Germany&apos;s goodwill. The German Staffs plan of concentrating on a decision in the West and leaving the Turkish fronts to look after themselves has caused great resentment, and Turkish officialdom has been touched on the raw by German interference in Turkish administration. Hence symptoms of &quot; defeatism &quot; have appeared under the tension in Turco-German relations since the fall of Bagdad.3. This tension has also produced a rift in the Turkish official ranks. There is evidence of discontent among the officers, which may find a rallying point in Rahmi Bey, the Governor of Smyrna ; while within the C.U.P. dissension has been produced by the corruption, ambition, and pro-Germanism of Enver and the corruption and revengefulness of Shukri. The &quot; opposition&quot; led by Fethy Bey is probably in collusion with Talaat. On the other hand, ShukrPs opposition seems to be genuine. Shukri is playing for his own hand, and is quite capable of a &quot; defeatist&quot; policy, but it is doubtful what support he can get for a policy which is irreconcilable with the interests of the official oligarchy.The corporate interest of this oligarchy in the Governments war aims and the strength of Germany&apos;s military prestige remain the dominant factors in the Turkish political situation.o
