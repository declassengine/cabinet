DESPATCH No. 8.From General Fairholme, Military Attache, Athens.British Legation,Athens, 11th May, 1918.My Lord,I have the honour to report that I returned yesterday from Salonika, where I * spent a fortnight in visiting the various units of the Greek Army actually in the war zone.These were: (A.) In front line, in the French sector, the National Defence Army Corps commanded by General Zymbrakakis, consisting of :-(1.) The Cretan Division (General Spiliades). (2.) The Archipelago Division (General Yoannou). (3.) The Seres Division (General E. Zymbrakakis).In the British sector, the following unit of the 1st Army Corps:  The 1st Division (General Nider).(B.) Still under instruction at Naresh camp, near Salonika. The 13th Division (1st Army Corps, General Negroponte).The National Defence Army Corps is holding a portion of the line west of Lake Doiran and, together with a French Division on each side of it, is under the command of General Gerome.Two of its regiments had been withdrawn temporarily to rehearse an attack which may be undertaken shortly.I was able to visit most of the other units during the three days I spent with the Corps and my impression confirmed the favourable opinion which was expressed to me by General Gerome, who considers these troops to be &quot; aguerries &quot; and fit to be trusted.He also said that whereas in the beginning they hated digging and ran away at the sight of a pick or a spade, now they work exceedingly well, and I was able to confirm this when visiting some of the most advanced trenches which had been cut in the solid rock and were being deepened and developed most efficiently under the guidance oi professional miners in the ranks.The physique of the men was distinctly good, and they seemed to be in excellent health and spirits.   The percentage of sick was extraordinarily small.These are probably the best troops Greece will be able to put in the field, consisting as they do to a considerable extent of volunteers, some of whom came from distant countries, sacrificing their situation or business. Many of these spoke English, generally with an unmistakable American accent.The corps and divisional commanders did not all appear to be up to the same standard. Neither the first-named nor his namesake commanding the Seres Division are highly thought of as commanders, but General Yoannou, an old Evzone, is a thorough soldier and would be a credit to any army, while General Spiliades, of whom I saw little, is well spoken of.General Gerome praised all four chief staff officers, of whom the general staff officer, 1st grade, of the Cretan Division, a graduate of the French Ecole de Guerre, seemed to me particularly efficient.The 1st Division (Larissa) was the first unit of the Greek regular Army to be put in the field after Greece became our Ally. It was made up to war strength without drawing on any reservists, as the political situation was not considered ripe forP(B18/276)  35  5/18  H4S  6927wo
mobilization at the time. Thus, except for the non-commissioned officers, many of whom were older soldiers, the majority of the men were recruits belonging to the 1916 and 1917 contingents, which only began their military training a few months ago. I am informed that some 2,300 reservists are now being drafted to this division, but at the time of my visit it appeared to consist mainly of mere boys, and in physique it contrasted very unfavourably with the divisions described above and with the (&apos; 13th Division.The moral, however, appeared to me to be good, and this is borne out by the tone of the men&apos;s letters home which have been scrutinized by our censorship.The division is under the orders of General Briggs, commanding the XVIth British Army Corps, and has recently taken over a section of our line on the Struma. It has taken part in the recapture of some villages south of Seres which we had evacuated voluntarily last year, and, I am informed, did its part satisfactorily on the whole, making allowances for the inexperience of the troops. There were some failures at first, and General Nider informed me that 15 men are being tried for cowardice. General Briggs appears to consider that this Greek division promises to become efficient when it has got over its rawness.General Nider, an Engineer officer, is a good and reliable commander who may be * trusted to do his duty. He is of Bavarian origin, though entirely Greek in sentiment and a staunch supporter of Venizelos, and has apparently inherited German thoroughness.He confided to me that many of his officers, especially those of junior rank, are slack and inefficient, which he attributes to their too rapid promotion, rendered necessary owing to the abnormal situation. He was particularly dissatisfied with the officers of the 38th (1st Evzone) Regiment.The health of the division is satisfactory though the proportion of sick was greater than in the National Defence Army Corps, owing no doubt both to the youth of the men and to the unhealthiness of the Struma Valley.The 13th Division, which I visited at the training camp at Naresh, was the first of the divisions of the Greek Regular Army to be normally mobilized, and the presence of its reservists naturally gave its units a far more mature appearance than that of the 1st Division troops. The physique of the regiments was distinctly good, and I was especially struck by the fine appearance of the men of the two mountain artillery groups and of the Eyzone Regiment (42nd Infantry Regiment).There was^ however, wanting that active service look which men only acquire after having been in the field for some time, and which was so noticeable in the National Defence Army Corps troops.I did not gain the impression that the training was being as strenuously conducted as ought to have been the case in a unit on the point of going up into the line, and this may have been due both to shortcomings on the part of the commander and to a less efficient squad of French Mission officers than those with other divisions.General Negroponte, whose acquaintance I had made during the recent visit of the Duke of Connaught to Athens, when he was attached to the Staff of His Royal Highness, is an officer of Engineer origin who has been an instructor at the Evelpides school in the past and has written military text-books. - He speaks English perfectly, and I understand is partly of British origin. He is a very agreeable gentleman and very talkative, but has had no experience in command of troops, and seemed to me to attach more importance to the childish ornamentation of the men&apos;s camps than to matters connected with their training.The 13 th Division is to begin to move up to the Struma front on 15th May and will no doubt be followed before long by the 2nd (Athens) Division, which moves from Cozani to Naresh at the same time. General Paraskovopoulos and the 1st Army Corps Headquarters will move from Athens to the Struma Valley very shortly and will no doubt be joined there by the 2nd Division when it has completed its training.The Greek Commander-in-Chief, General Danglis, is to shift his Headquarters to Salonika in June, and he will be accompanied by General Bordeaux and the Head-quarters of the French Military Mission from Athens.I am informed that the mobilization of the Ilnd Army Corps in the Peloponnesus is proceeding quite smoothly in spite of the misgivings which had been expressed in various quarters, notably by the British and French secret services. The 3rd Division reservists were called out on 8th May and those of the 4th and 14th are to join on the 25th June and 25th July respectively.The 3rd Division as soon as mobilized is to come to Athens for training in the first instance and will, I understand, be followed successively by the other two.
Of the Army Units in preparation, the first groups of three 6-inch howitzer batteries trained at the British Artillery School has already gone up to the National Defence Army Corps front. General Onslow is satisfied with the results obtained so far, and especially praised to me the Greek Artillery non-commissioned officers, to whom it appears their officers are inclined to leave more than is the case with us, and he also spoke favourably of the gunners. A British officer remains with each of the batteries for the present.A French trained group of two 120-mm. batteries has also gone forward and a third battery is ready.Throughout my trip I was much struck by the way in which the British and French auxiliary services are doing what may be called all the dirty work for the Greek units at the front, and both the British and French Commanders-in-Chief spoke to me very strongly indeed of the imperative necessity for the provision and organization by the Greek Army at the earhest possible moment of all that is required to make it independent in this respect. This would involve the mobilization of a number of the older classes, only the men up to 30 years of age having up to now been drawn on in Greece, whereas I understand we are utilizing men up to 50 years of age in Great Britain.In principle there ought to be, in addition to the reserves for replacing casualties, at least one man in the &quot; services de 1&apos;arriere &quot; for every man in front line. These men are required for Lines of Communication troops, Supply and Ordnance depots and Engineer park personnel, repair workshops for arms, clothiDg, vehicles, guns, aircraft, &amp;c, mechanical and other transport drivers and artificers, telegraph and telephone services, railway and road construction and maintenance, hospitals and veterinary hospitals, remount depots, &amp;c.All the above are now practically non-existent in rear of the Greek Army.I discussed this question with General Bordeaux to-day, and he informed me that its importance had by no means been overlooked by the Greek War Office or by himself. The reason why no more has been done up to now is that the Greek Government has not considered it judicious to attempt to impose on the country at the present stage of its political development the further sacrifices entailed by the mobilization of additional classes of reservists. He pleaded the great difficulties the Government has still to contend with owing to the effects of the sytematic poisoning of the public mind and of the Army under the late regime. He remarked that Constantinisin is still alive in many quarters and will not die out until its partisans are convinced that the ex-King can never return to the throne. He stated that there is reason to believe that German money has quite recently arrived in this country for propaganda purposes, and that local minor troubles in the Army are still not unlikely to occur. He estimates that quite 500 of the officers now serving are at least lukewarm as regards participation in the war and have no &quot; bonne volonte &quot; whatever.      *It is impossible to dispense with their services as there are no others ready to replace them.General Bordeaux assured me that every effort would be made to provide the auxiliary services as soon as practicable and that Monsieur Yenizelos firmly intends to call up as many additional classes of reservists as may be required for the purpose as soon as the political situation allows him to do so.It is only natural that the Allied Commanders-in-Chief should press for the provision of these services to relieve their own whose &quot; rendement,&quot; marvellous as it has shown itself to be, must have its limitations, and one can well understand that the Greek mobilization by successive units should appear to them to be going at snaifs pace, but to those who, like myself, were in this country while it w7as under the domination of the late regime, and who have been present during all that has happened here in the last two years, it may perhaps seem surprising that so many difficulties have been overcome, and that the same troops who were firing on British and French bluejackets on the 1st December, 1916, should to-day be fighting on our side with the enthusiasm which I observed in the units at the front.Wherever I went I was received with the warmest cordiality by all the commanders, who vied with each other in entertaining me, and in showing me as much of their commands as the limited time at my disposal allowed. There could be no mistake as to the genuineness of the pro-British sympathies of officers and men. Those of the 1st Division were obviously delighted to be in the British sector, and were enthusiastic regarding their treatment by their British comrades, while those of the 13th Division expressed their ardent wish to be sent to the British portion of the line.
This report would not be complete without a reference to the work of the French Military Mission, which has detachments of officers of all arms and services with each of the Greek higher units.The valuable services of this body of officers are acknowledged alike by the Greek officers and by our own. The mission of Lieut.-Colonel Vary, attached to the 1st Greek Division, is particularly efficient, owing in great measure to the ability and tact of its chief.I have the honour to be,My Lord, Your Lordship&apos;s obedient Servant,W. E. FAIRHOLME, Brigadier-General, Military Attache.
