The only routes available for additional imports of coal are, therefore, the rail-cum-sea route via Bouohes ,du Rhone ports, and the all-sea route.   To tho former route has be&apos;en allocated the transport of&apos;6,000 tons per day and, in aotual practice, even this rate of import has not been realised owing to the lack of Italian.shipping for the lifting of this quantity from the Bouohes du Rhone ports.   Apart from the shortage of shipping at the disposal of the Italian Government, there would be great difficulty in finding rolling stock for transport to the Bouohes $u Rhone ports, which would necessarily affect other important traffic^It appears to the Council, therefore, that the all-sea route is the only route by which the proposed reserve can be built up. Recently, when the all-rail route was temporarily occupied by troop movement, and coal traffic ha&amp;* consequently, to be suppressed, import by the all-sea route was increased so that the monthly rate of imports  became for the time being  50,000 instead of 150,000 tons.   It appears to the Transportation Council that every effort should be made to keep all, or at any rate a considerable part, of this Additional tonnage in this trade, and that before it is diverted to other purposes the   * opportunity should bo taken of building up the proposed stook of 150,000 tons in Italy.   If this is not done, the Council are convinced that when troop movement to Italy does take plaoe the Allied Governments will be forced to make arrangements for again diverting shipping to the Italian coal trade., thereby causing  ar greater dislocation of other traffic than if the reserves wore accumulated now.ISgd.)
