Colonel I, Dally lmdocumt is the property.of.his britactic. majesty1 s GovBHprasryU.....nu 4745 *TO CABINET.DESIRABILITY OF INCREASING THE. QUANTITY OF HEWS-PRINT.,(Msmorandum?by the shipping Controller)vI have read the Memorandum by the Minister of Information on the subject of increasing the quantity of News-print (paper G.T.4611) and also the Memorandum of the 28th May by the President of the Board of Trade (G.T.4680)., Under the existing ration as agreed with the paper Con-troller and when account is taken of the actual imports for the first 4 months of the year, the average import for the remainder of 1918 of all paper and paper making materials appears to work out at just over 30,000 tons a month.   I should hesitate to say that an increased import from Norway could be managed at present without risk of excluding essential cargo such as ore, but if, as is probable, the import of pulp from Sweden is resumed as a result of the recent agreement with that country, there would be no objection on tonnage grounds to an increase in the pulp ration not exceeding 5,000 &quot;tons a month on the understanding that the quantity in question would be Swedish pulp to be carried in Swedish bottoms and without any liability upon the Ministry of Shipping to make good any deficiency from other sources if the Swedish tonnage did not In fact lift the full quantity.(Sgd.)    J.  . MACLAY .Ministry of shipping, 3rd June,, 1918.,
