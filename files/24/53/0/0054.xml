HEALTH.&apos; .  &apos; &quot; ........ &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Note by tho President of the Local Government Boardii r rIn view of the&apos; prospective absence of the Home Secretary I circulate a letter which he has addressed to me with reference to the Draft Bill for the establishment of a 2 Ministry of Health.W. IUYES FISHER,5th June, 1918.Home Office,Whitehall, S .1.1. 4th June, 1918.My dear Hayes Fisher,As I shall probably be abroad when the Ministry of Health Sill is discussed, I write ti say that I am in agreement with your memorandum.The question of name is not very important;   but if the head of your Department is called the Minister of Health, the greater part of hie duties will not be represented In his title. In any cace I deprecate Long&apos;s proposal to call the new department the &quot;Ministry of the Interior&quot;, as I consider that expression to be French for &quot;Home Office&quot;.As to the proposed Consultative Council, I think it would put the Minister of Health in a very difficult position. It is true, as Addison says, that the Home Office often consult other bodies interested in their work;   but these informal conferences have no analogy with the- position proposed to be given to the Consultative Council under the Bill.Of course I recognise that the position of the Insuranco Commissioners should receive consideration.    Would it be possible to retain the Commissioners as a statutory body working under the Ministry of Health, as the Prison Commission and the Board of Control work under the Home Office?As to your third point, I do not see that much is gained by including paragraph 1 of the first schedule.    That paragraph is merely declaratory and is contingent on future legislation;   and it is impossible to say in advanco what form the legislation would take.      It may put the Home Office, which has many other unpopular duties, in charge of the Poor La?/ Institutions.Yours sincerely, G30. CAVE.
