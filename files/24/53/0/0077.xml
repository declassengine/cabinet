Colonel W. Dally km.0,   /jj WAR CABINET. ,204Censorship of Illustrated Technical Papers.memorandum &quot;by General Staff. V/ar Office.Illustrations of British technical devices are chiefly found in technical papers.It became evident to the War Office, many months ago, that the present &quot;voluntary&quot; censorship exercised by the Official Press Bureau entirely failed to prevent tho publication of such illustrations and (what is more important) of the detailed descriptions accompanying them.In vievy of the objections raised by otlrer Departments to a proposal to render compulsory the submission to censorship of all scientific and technical matter &quot;before publication;, it is left to the Var Office to take all possible steps, by means of the Postal Censorship, to deprive the enemy of technical information published in this country0It has been found that the mere examination of papers passing through the post is, for reasons which need   not here be explained, a totally inadequate method of control,&apos; and the War Office propose that the Postal Censors should be authorized to stop the export of all technical papers the editors of which have not consented to submit each issue, or certain parts of each, as required, to a designated authority before publication.In order to make this restriction as little irksome as possible, and to encourage the idea of &quot;censorship by scientists for scientists&quot;, it is proposed to give editors the option of consulting a Committee of the Conjoint Board of Scientific Societies instead of the Press Bureau.   This Committee is to be kent fully informed of the views of the Departments concerned as to tho subjects which it is inadvisable to discuss at any particular time and of certain facts, ascertained by the Postal Censorship, which will enable them to judge to what extent the foreign circulation of various kinds of technical information should he restricted.The Conjoint Board of Scientific Societies have agreed to act but the Home Office, at the instance of the Press Bureau, take exception to the establishment of a separate authority for censoring scientific and technical publications and express the opinion that, if the proposed fJoirmittee is necessary, it should aot as an advisory committee to the Press Bureau.   Since, however, the censorship as intended to control export, and since the control of all postal communication with foreign countries has been placed in the hands of the Var Office, it appears that the intervention of the Press Bureau would offer no advantage sufficient to compensate for the absence of direct contact between those who wish to send technical matter abroad and the authority responsible for deciding to what foreign destinations, if any, it may be sent.The United States authorities, in reply to representations as to the inadequacy of their control in this respect, have recently pointed out that the existing British system of censorship does not succeed in stopping leakage of information of this kind.   The Admiralty, Ministry of hunitions and Air Ilinistry have already agreed in principle with the War Office scheme and the approval of the &apos;7ar Cabinet is desired in order to enable the Postal &quot;bens or ship to^caTry drTit&apos;b&quot;work under the best possible conditions and to demonstrate to the authorities in America that the question is treated seriously in this country.neral Staff, &apos; &apos;ar Office,6th June, 1918
