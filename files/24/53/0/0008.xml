Numerous requests for the Board1s explanatory-memorandum continue to he reoeived, and many additional copies are being asked for by the Agricultural Executive Committees,As soon as arrangements can be made for printing, the Board hope to issue a fuller leaflet giving a farmer all the information he would ordinarily require, and containing hints as to the method of keeping a simple form of acoounts, in order that he may be in a position to claim to be assessed, in effect, on his actual profits instead of on twioe the amount of his annual rent.land Division.Small HoIdin^Colonies.Patrington,    The farming operations for the week consisted of ploughing baclTand quartering fallows, scuffling beans for the third time, hand-hoeing wheats, -spring corn and peas, and harrowing and rolling potatoes.    As a result of the favourable weather conditions during the week all the crops have made rapid progress, and with very few exceptions are looking very well.    The crops, produce and stock disposed of during the week included 560 sacks of &quot;pulls&quot; or cavings, 4 pigs, 13 dozen chicks and 904 eggs.Holbeach.    The horses have been busy hoeing, harrowing, and scarifying amongst the potatoes, also occasionally helping on the settlers&apos; plots.    The settlers are all progressing satisfactorily and appear keen to learn.    Thirty pigs have been disposed of during the week, and all the crops on this colony are looking well.Heath Hill.    The farming operations have been held up by thunder atoms with hoavy rainfalls, approximately 3&quot; of rain having fallen in two days, with very beneficial results to all the crops on the colony.    The King Street Grange Hostel for women workers is nearly equipped for them, and three skilled trained workers have arrived and will be starting farm work immediately.Two Pordson Traoteaw have started on this colony and are working well.Kelham Estate.    Arrangements are in hand for obtaining priority \ certificates for materials for building the two concrete cottages upon the Estate, which are required for the housing of farm labourers. The farming operations are taking their normal course:   the live stock generally is doing well, and further purchases of horses, pigs and sheep have been made.    The first Rent Audit was held at the Kelham Estate Office on Thursday, 23rd May, with satisfactory results.3*lax Production Branch.The weeding of the flax crop is still proceeding:   the organisation, at short notice, of the weeding camps has been of considerable value in giving the necessary experience for the much wider organisation required for the harvesting in July and August, This organisation has been carried out in co-operation with theColonel \l Dally Jones.
Ministry of National Service, and through them the Boy Scouts&apos; Asnooiation, the War Office, the Ministry of Labour, and so far as women labour is concerned, the National land Servioe Corps.The preparation of existing premises being requisitioned, by the %r Offioe under the Defence of the Realm Aot is being made at high pressure in eo-operation with the Office of Works.    In addition to the factories for retting and scutching, a large number of temporary premises have been taken and adapted for reoeiving, de-seeding, and reducing the weight of a bulky crop.    These premises are situate in the heart of the various growing areas, the object being to reduce transport to a minimum, requirements under this head being an important faotor in the efficient and prompt dealing with the crop so as to provide in the first instance sowing seed in time for next. year!s sowing.Tithe, Copyhold, Commons^and Survey Branoh,During the past week eleven copyhold tenements have been enfranchised from the incidents of their tenure, while eight fresh . applications for enfranchisement have been reoeived.

Both farmers, orushers and merchants appear to be dissatisfied with the present policy of storing oil seed cakes in bulk in order to conserve supplies for next winter. Such action must cause congestion of transport, increased labour and a considerable expenditure for rent, insurance, supervision and handling, which must eventually increase the price of the cakes to the farmer.Pig Production Section,A number of inquiries as to the formation of Pig Clubs have been dealt with and a large-number of callers seen.    The correspondence as to the difficulty in obtaining feeding stuffs is very large and the matter is frequently being brought to the attention of the Ministry of l?ood, the Director of Pig Production having taken active personal steps in the mattdr.    On Saturday last Mr. Cautley opened a piggery at East Barnet that had been established by a Committee formed for the purpose.    Inquiries for speakers continue to ccme in and the appointment of officers for this work is now being proceeded with.Ordnance Survey.mmmmmmfmmmmmmmmm*mmi.....mmmDuring the week 75,016 maps were sent to Prance and 112,485 to the Admiralty,    10 relief models were sent to Prance,

The Board have issued one consent to the institution of proceedings under this Act during the week.Fisheries Division*Ad^nl strati ve.......ggotion.    Endeavour is &quot;being made to obtainRussian trawlers in exchange for raw material and gear needed for the development of fisheries on the Hurman Coast.   Enquiries are being made in connect ion with complaints of pollution, in the Rivers Tyne and Trent.   Proposals for dredging for tin in 8t, Ives Bay have &quot;been considered and recommendations made to the Board of Trade in the matter,   -Enquiry has been held by officers of the Division into questions affecting fishing operations in Christ church Harbour,Permit Section.    68 pemits to fish have been issued, prinoi-pally tor herring fishing, and IS have been cancelled,    A notice restricting trawling in a portion of the Dover Command has bsen circulated among fishermen concerned,    A report has been received and communicated to the Admiralty relating to the sinking by enemy action of three Lowestoft smacks,Yt8haraen*e Registration and Recruiting Section, 1 sheraen tand tNaval Service,    A letter has heen addressed to the SecretarF^lHi^^ofHaffWsKery Board urging the immediate adoption of the standard proportion of two Scottish fishermen to one from England and Wales in the drafts periodically furnished for the trawler section from the Royal JTaval Volunteer Reserve, Seotion This proportion was agreed in principle some months back at a , Conference with t&amp;e Admiralty, at which both Boards were represented,Fishermen, Fish prods, and Military, Service,    A formal case has to en made and presenteofto ihe Ministry of National Service for the release of fishermen from the Army, a project which was sympathetically considered by that Department at a Conference with this Section with la view to facilitating and as far as possible to ensure the revum of fishermen employed In controlled establishments to the sea.    Oases of fish salesmen and carters at Brixham called to military service have drawn attention to ttie position at that port.    The oases have been considered with the Ministry of Food and further enquiries are being made,
Motoran^^rnmi11e.    The Committee are finding it difficult with tEelr preseiTPe^af^of mechanics to oope with all the work which is urgently demanded in preparation for the summer fishing.    An     .&apos;: installation has &quot;been completed, at Shorofcam;   two are on hand at Hastings and only delayed by the difficulty of procuring materials while manufacturers are so short-handed.    A twin-screw installation, at Lowest oft is also likely to be delayed for the completion of one :-part of the outfit.    The question of running repairs is also very &quot; urgent, and there is great demand for the services of the Committee&apos;^ mechanios.    It is hoped that in the case of the fishing fleets the : difficulty will be surmounted by an arrangement between the owners-of motor-boats and the Committee for the payment of a mechanic solely for the purpose of attending to the motor-boats at the particular ports.BJiSMl^^:^&apos;^* work of the Committee has been largelydevoted to obtaining at the request of the Admiralty the equipment for the Russians in accordance with the arrangements made for the acquisition of Russian trawlers.    The Comaittee have suoceeded in securing practically the whole of the equipment Squired.    The principal difficulty is in obtaining sufficient quantities of fishing lines,    A representative of the Committee has visited Glasgow and Aberdeen to obtain supplies.    The necessary licences and priority -certificates have been or are being obtained.The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines indicatedin previous reports.Secretary,30th May, 1018.
