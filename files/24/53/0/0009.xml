(1)29th May, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 28th May, 1918!*The leather.In spite of the extremely variable weather which has been experienced throughout the country the prospect of both corn and hay crops has greatly improved during the past week.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION, Agricultural Executive Committees. Buckinghamshire.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a farm at Little Missenden.      The tenant is short Of capital but will not avail himself of credit facilities offered to him by the Committee.      Moreover, the buildings have recently been destroyed by fire, and in these circumstances, there&apos; was no likelihood of the cultivation being carried, on unless the Committee had taken possession and cultivated the farm themselves, as they are now doing.Gloucestershire.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a 100-aore farm at lestbury-on-Severn, the owner-oocupier not being in a condition to cultivate it.      He has been prosecuted and,convicted for failure to comply with an order directing him to plough up 6 acres of grass land and to cultivate properly 10 acres of existing arable.    The farm has been inspeoted since the proceedings took place, and the report shows
that there is no likelihood *of improvement unless possession is taken.    The buildings are falling down from neglect. Suffolk, West - The Corar.ittee have been authorised to take posses.!; of a 200-acre farm at Hundon which has been seriously neglected. This farm had been under observation for a year and on two occasion! the tenantfs sons, who are farming elsewhere, undertook to eeeure the proper cultivation of the land if their father would not inter fere.     They have, however, been unable to carry out their undertaking,Surrey - The Committee have decided to take possession of a farm of 320 acres at Lingfleld which includes only 21 acres of arable, It is occupied by the son of the owner and was once carried on as s dairy farm, but all the cattle were sold off about five years ago, The ditches have not been cleaned out for years, and the farm is practically waterlogged.     It will be let rent free to a neigh-bouring farmer on the condition that he spends a specified sum on hedging, restoring culverts, etc. Prosecutions *- In the North Riding a farmer at Oswaldkirk has been fined  75 for failure to plough up 51 acres of grass land, the Ben stating that they treated the offence leniently as it was the firs1 case that had occurred in Ryedale.     In Norfolk a farmer at Kirby Cane has been fined  25 for failure to plough up 12 acres, and in Somerset a farmer near Selwood has been fined  15 and  5 costs for, failure to plough up 30 acres. Determination of Tenancies - During the week 3 Orders have been ma authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 231 acres, and 1 Order has been made by the Department determining the tenancy of 9 acres,HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Marketing Organisation - Seven additional Societies, making a total of 11 to date, have been organised for the Marketing Scheme during! the week. The chief difficulty to be overcome in connection witlfc these Schemes is that of securing the necessary supplies of Petrqjj1
in order to collect the produce.     Negotiations on the subject have, however, been opened with the Road Transport Board. Provision of Land for Allotments - Reports received from 1,166 districts show that 302,089 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No,2), and that 274,684 plots containing 19,875 acres have been provided.During the week seven Local Authorities have undertaken to acquire, In addition to the area mentioned above, 32 ceres (470 allotments).    At Tarporley (Cheshire) each of the 600 householders is cultivating either a garden or an allotment.   Southampton has already provided 242 acres (3,000 allotments), and the Local Authority is endeavouring to obtain a further 20 acres for next season.     At Daventry (Nor-thants) 572 out of the 800 householders are cultivating allotments, all of which have been acquired privately.The Department has been successful in arranging for the -. continuation of tenancy of two groups of allotments, the holders of . -which were under notice to relinquish their plots. Y.M.C.A.Huts - A field of 14 acres has been, obtained for cultivation by the Australians stationed at Weymouth.     6 acres ere to be sown with wheat, 5 acres reserved for vegetables, and the rest for fruit, The Australians wish to establish this land as a centre of instruction for troops leaving England for Australia. Fruit Section - 80 public Demonstrations in fruit preservation have been held during the week.     The total number of jars for fruit preserving ordered through the Glassware Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions now amounts to 6,275,628 of which 1,976,256 have been delivered;Pteports received from the principal fruit districts showthat the prospects of the soft fruit crops are exceedingly poor.In the Norwich and Wisbech area it is estimated that, except in thecase of raspberries, from which three-quarters to a full crop maybe expected, other soft fruits will yield as followsBlackcurrants   ...     ......1/3 - l/4 cropGooseberries     .........1/4 - &quot;Strawberries......... l/4 - 1/2     &quot;tm 3&quot;&quot;
Greenhouse Cultivation - An inspection which has been made of the premises of the large firms in the Swanley district of Kent shows30)that practically all the glasshouses formerly devoted to flowers and strawberries are now being set aside for tomatoes, while during the winter the glasshouses1 have, in many cases, been left empty owing to lack of labour and fuel.Belgian Basket Factory, Hammersmith - 80 persons are now employed in basket making at this Factory, and it is hoped to increase the number to 100 within the next fortnight.     Good progress is also being made at the Surbiton Basket School, where crippled Belgian soldiers are employed.TECHNICAL DIVISION.mmm*mmmm*m n.-^..,-.1.......**** ********** -.......Wintering of Hill Sheep,     The inspection of hill farms and sheep stocks in the north and west of England and in Wales has now been completed, and a-report on the condition of the stock and the possibility of improvements in grazing and management will be submitted.     The figures collected indicate a considerable variation in the quantity of mutton and wool produced per acre on hill farms in different districts.Lucerne.   An enquiry has been addressed to farmers and others who are known to have grown lucerne successfully, and on the basis of the information thus obtained it is proposed to carry out experiments at different centres for the purpose of ascertaining the conditions necessary for successful cultivation. Breaking-up Grassland.   A report of an enquiry made into 85 cases of grassland (1,658 acres) in Oxfordshire broken up during the period July 1st, 1917, to March 51st, 1918, shows that failures occurred chiefly with land ploughed from November to March and that earlier ploughing gave consistently good results.     From this enquiry there appeared to be little doubt that If the land is not ploughed before taking the hay crop ploughing immediately afterwards Is desirable. f )
Plant Diseases *     The Plant Diseases Sub-Committee have submitted a report on the Occurrence of Insect and Fungus Pests during 1917,. &quot;Sunshine&quot; Harvester.   It has been decided to secure the importation, for experimental purposes, of one of these machines, which harvest and thresh grain in one operation, and are widely used in Australia. .LABOUR DIVISION., &apos; Recruiting.   The County Agricultural Executive Committees are examining&apos;the cases of all men,of Grade I who are 3till engaged in agriculture and under 31 years of age, with&apos; a view to deciding which men can be released in order to make up the county quota with the least possible detriment to food production.    The Committees are loyally endeavouring to carry out the decision of the War^ Cabinet, namely that 30,000 men are to be selected.from agriculture for Military Service, and that, save in exceptional cases, all men of Grade&apos;I under 23 years of- age are to be released. Soldier Labour.   The number of soldiers now out on farms is 57,707.     Of these men 4,000 have been sent out for instruction in horse ploughing, 4,093 for instruction as tractor drivers and ploughmen, and 212 for training with steam ploughs or threshing tackle,Prisoners of War,     Prisoners have arrived at five additionalprisoner camps during the week, making.,the total number ofprisoners now employed on farm or drainage, work as followsFrom 71 ordinary agricultural camps ....   6,226&quot;   116 ploughmen camps ...     .... 4,220Employed from other camps        ......   1,008&apos; .     11,454Released aliens employed in agriculture r 1,912.. 15,566161 schemes for the establishment of additional campsare now with the War Office.     These camps, together with the
larger numbers of prisoners required at many of the existing, camps, will provide for the employment of 9,649 additional prisoners in agriculture.Danish,Labour.   The Department have been informed by the Ministry of Labour that a small number of Danish workmen are being recruited in Denmark for employment in agriculture in this country. Farmers are being communicated with in order to ensure the placing of thesfe men immediately on their arrival;     It Is feared that the number of men who will come to this country will be so small that only a very small proportion of the applications will be met.WOMEN*S BRANCH. Recruiting,   The chief features of the week&apos;s recruiting in London have been (1) the successful employment of a band with the Headquarters Recruiting Staff, (2) the popularity of the new Enquiry Bureau in Victoria Street, and (3) the very excellent meetings held on Thursday and Friday on the steps of the Royal Exchange.Mid-day meetings have been held this week in Oxford Street, Holborn and the Royal Exchange.    At the latter places the meetings were most enthusiasticThe new Enquiry Bureau has been thronged with enquirers during the week and since Tuesday morning 117 women have enrolled there.     40 have also signed on,at the Y.M.CA. Hut in Trafalgar Square.Apart from any direct influence which these various meetings may-have had on the recruiting figures.for London during the week, and excluding the possible results of the Royal Exchange meetings, the members of the Headquarters Recruiting Staff are directly responsible for the enrolment of 374 recruits.The appeal in London has brought in such a good type of recruit that the percentage of those finally approved and selected is the highest in England except in the South Western area, where very few and only specially suitable recruits aref)enrolled.
9 ra 514 rallies in different centres have been held during the weekoTraining *   During the.week 28 new training centres1 have been opened to accommodate 95 women.     Three new gang hostels have also been sanctioned to accommodate a further 160, and at one of these at Ousefleet in Yorkshire, a further 40 will be accommodatedoSouth Court House at Leighton Buzzard, Bucks, is to be opened next week as a training centre for 50 women.,;&apos;An efficiency]test of 21 members of the Land Army was held at Shrewsbury on May .10th.    . There were 13 entries in milking, 3 in ploughing. 5 in harrowing and 9 in grooming and gearing.      The highest point of efficiency was reached by one* * * *woman in ploughing and another in grooming.. -    Several came as high a3 99%, 98$ and 95$ and none of the entries lower than 75%. The work accomplished was very satisfactory and the farmers expressed great.appreciation pf.it,10.299 women are-accounted for in:the Land Army as follows..

Up to the 25th of this month 1^570 Fordsons have been despatched from the factory at Manchester.    This figure includes those delivered for the use of the Department and those f*r disposal by the makers.    An equivalent number of Oliver ploughs have also been despatched.Price Control.   After consultation with the Advisory CommitteemmmnmmmmmmpmtmMmm......1 n&apos; 4 ......of ivlanufaoturers and Dealers, the Ministry of Munitions are sub-mitting to the Department and its equivalent authority in Scotland and Ireland a proposal for the control of prices of all agricul-tural and dairying implements.Petrol. Tests have been made in connection with a request by the Petroleum Executive that the Department should consider the
advisability of using petrol in place of paraffin as a fuel for tractors &quot;(with a view to saving tJuIfc shipment).    ^ report has been submitted to the effect that whilst no material saving in the bulk of fuel used can be looked for, less lubricating oil is needed when petrol is /used, and there is also less wear and tear on the engine.Easing calculations upon the prices given by the Petroleum Executive and the number of tractors at present the property of the, Department, it is estimated that the use of petrol in place of paraffin would involve an extra cost of over  900,000Aper annum, plus  30,000 for alterations to carburettors, against a saving of  60,000 per annum in lubricating oil, and an estimated saving of mechanical repairs of 25 per cent.In view of these facts the Department is unable to agree to the proposed alteration in respect of Government tractors, but have suggested that it should be made optional as regards privately-owned tractors.Horses.      10,000 Government owned,horses are now at work.     Thewvmmwmmtmim W* ****** * isteps taken to check and cure mange have proved moat satisfactory. Directions have been circulated that all horses working binders at harvest time shall be double-shifted.Threshing.   Satisfactory progress is being made in connection with the formation of Threshing Sub-Committees in the, counties. In  most cases the policy of dividing the county Into areas and allotting a certain number of threshing sets to each area has been adopted.Organisation Inspectors.     The Inspectors recently appointed, one for each eight counties are proving of great service.    They visit each Engineer Contractor to see that he has a proper whole-time staff as laid down in the Contractors&apos; Agreement, an(* that his premises are properly fitted up to carry out the work.      They examine the premises placed at the disposal of the Department for
rthe storage of fuel and spare parts, and have been able to effect some considerable Improvements in this respect.They also examine the vvork of the Supplies Clerk and ; a result of their investigations several inefficient clerks have been discharged.   Their work in every way tends to safeguard the interests of the Department.Berkshire *   The following is an extract from a report receivedfrom the District Commissioner for Berkshire.&quot;The tractors under the control of the Committee continue to be usefully employed, being mostly engaged in cross ploughing and cultivating., I have had a good illustration during the week of the development of the use of tractors, privately-owned, on an arable farm.   The farm in question, on the light chalk soil In Berkshire, consists of 500 acres of which 430 are arable. The occupier has two Overtime tractors, and has just bought a third.   He has sold one stable of six horses and declares that his work is better done and more up-to-date with his two tractors and six remaining horses than It was before.   The small size of the staff employed is very remarkable.   For his one stable of six horses he has one head carter, one under carter (his wife) and a boy; for the mechanical side there are two traotor drivers and he himself is employed,- apart from supervision full time as mechanic and smith.1   In addition there is one day man.   This farm is a good Illustration of war-time farming, all conditions being adapted to obtaining the maximum amount of cereal produce as quickly as possible with the minimum of labour power.   The flock of hurdle sheep have been disposed of for the period of the war, the labour power necessary for root growing reduced to almost nil and the largest acreage possible of the farm -   devoted to corn growing with the assistance of a free use of artificial manures.&quot;Lincoln, Holland Division.   Considerable satisfaction was expressedat a recent meeting of the Holland Executive Committee that theadministrative county had won the tractor championship for Englandand Wales for the preceding month.   The Chairman of the MachineryCommittee aaid that it was clear that the inaugural work done bythe Department would bear fruit in years to come, and thatagriculture would have reason to thank the promoters of the TractorScheme for the assistance they had given to the country In the hourof its necessity.   He also stated that their county would not havebeen so successful had it not been for the enthusiasm andefficiency of the officers selected to work the scheme.   A memberof the Executive Committee stated that during the time the drivers
and ploughmen were at work on his land they were &quot;an example to the men working on the farm.&quot;A specially interesting report was submitted to the same Executive Committee.this week, summarising a month&apos;s work of nine Fordson tractors and nine Titan tractors respectively. The month in question ended April 12th.     The total acreage cultivated, harrowed, rolled, ploughed and dragged by the Fprdson tractors amounted to 2,472 acres, and the total amount earned was  974. 2s.   The nine Titan tractors cultivated, etc 1,335 acres of land, and earned  730. 15. 6.     In commenting on the,above work, the Machinery Officer states that there will be a great demand for Fordson tractors immediately after harvest. At the same time it is necessary in a county with varying types of soil that an average of 25% of the heavier type of tractors such as the Titan should be available. &apos;   The results from, the Titan tractors have been very satisfactory,     They have done excellent work in the county in breaking up several thousands of acres of grassland which.has been ploughed from ten to twelve Inches deep with a single-furrow plough fitted with wide skimmers, disc coulters and furrow knives.     The Titan tractor, however, is not so satisfactory for cultivating or working land which has been previously ploughed.     The Fordson excels here on account of the wide difference in weight,.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Fertilisers.     General licences have now been issued to all makers of sulphate of ammonia, superphosphate and basic slag, authorising them to make sales of limited quantities for delivery to destinations which do not Involve excessive charges for railway transport.    Applications have been received from makers of basic slag for special licences to sell the whole of their output during .the ensuing season.     A scheme has been prepared for the distribution of the output of each works In a
way calculated to secure equitable distribution over the country and at the same time to reduce railway transport to a minimum.     I Applications have also been received from over 900 persons wishing to be recognised as Approved Agents, covering practically the whole output of sulphate of ammonia and basic slag in England and Wales. A provisional allocation of supplies is now being made, considera-tion being given in the first place to the applications by Approved Agents.   Arrangements have also been made for the issue of special licences in order to meet the requirements of Ireland. Superphosphate.   A surplus supply of superphosphate exists at certain works in the London district. Agricultural Executive Committees and merchants have been advised of this supply.   The railway position in the Mersey district, which was recently causing trouble, has now greatly improved.Potash.   Revised arrangements have now been made with regard to the sale of blast furnace dust during the ensuing season, the price being fixed at from 7/6 to 8/6 per unit of potash. -Compound Fertilisers.   The draft of the proposed compound Fertilisers Order was considered by the Phosphates and Potash Committee. The prices for the coming season were agreed with the makers represented on the Committee, and the .general terms of the Order were approved.Seed Oats.   The Department have disposed of the balance of their stocks of Scotch oats for milling purposes.   The unsold stock of Irish seed oats has been allocated to the Oats Distribution Committee at Bristol for distribution amongst dealers who will dispose of it only to the owners of town horses and col3.*s?ry ponies.Wart Disease.   Proceedings were instituted against two potato merchants in Cambridgeshire who had sent potatoes to Glamorgan
in contravention of the Restricted Districts Order No.1. Convictions were obtained in both cases and fines of  10 and  1 respectively were inflicted.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.&quot;President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
