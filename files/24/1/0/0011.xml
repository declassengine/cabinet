Paper 2-B.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,            March 11, 1915.
     THE two following C.I.D.  Papers, 1-B and 2-B, have a close  hearing on thesubjects discussed at the meeting of the War Council on Wednesday, the 10th March,1915.     2. The circumstances under which these papers were prepared were as follows :      At the second meeting of the Committee of Imperial  Defence, held  on the 11thEebruary, 1903,*  the question arose as to the  effect  on the naval  position in theMediterranean of  a Russian  occupation of  Constantinople and the Straits.  Por  thismeeting the  Admiralty  circulated the  enclosed C.I.D. Paper No.  2-B.   After adiscussion, at which Sir Nicholas O&apos;Conor, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Constantinople,was present, Mr. Balfour prepared a report on the conclusions of the Committee, whichwas printed as C.I.D.  Paper  1-B.     3. The following  two passages are of particular importance:     &quot; What difference would it make to the balance of power in&apos;the Mediterranean if Russia wereto obtain, through the possession of Constantinople, free egress from the Black Sea through theDardanelles, these remaining closed, as at present, against other Powers?    &quot;The answer to this question,  unanimously accepted  by the  Committee, was that, whileRussia would no doubt  obtain  certain,  naval advantages  from the  change, it would notfundamentally alter the present strategic position in the Mediterranean.         *          *          * -        * .        . *        &apos;  *         *    &quot; The occupation of  Lemnos, near the mouth of the Dardanelles, would, on the other hand,be easy;  but it could not, with advantage, be made permanent.  The British  naval position inthe  Mediterranean would be weakened, not strengthened, by the possession of another naval base,which could not be self-sufficing without costly fortifications and a large  garrison;  and which, ifit were not self-sufficing,  would merely be an additional anxiety to the Admiral Commanding-in-Chief.&quot;                                                                   M. P. A. H.     March 11, 1915.SECRET.1-B.                                 II.REPORT  BY  MR.  BALEOUR  OP  THE CONCLUSION  ARRIVED  AT    ON  EEBRUARI  11,  1903,   IN  REEERENCE  TO  RUSSIA  AND    CONSTANTINOPLE.    THE  subject  of  the Dardanelles  and  Constantinople  was  discussed on the11th Eebruary in connection with two different but closely allied problems.    The first of these may be stated as follows :     What difference would it make to  the balance of power in  the Mediterraneanif  Russia were to obtain,  through the possession  of Constantinople, free egress fromthe Black  Sea through the Dardanelles, these  remaining closed, as at present, againstother Powers ?    The answer to this question, unanimously accepted by the Committee,  was thatwhile Russia would no doubt  obtain certain naval advantages from the change, itwould not fundamentally alter the present strategic position in the Mediterranean.    * The following Avere  present: The Duke of Devonshire (in the chair) ;  the Prime Minister;  the Earlof  Selborne, First Lord of the Admiralty ; Admiral the Lord  Walter Kerr,  Senior Naval Lord; CaptainH.S.H. Prince Louis of Battenberg, Director  of Naval Intelligence; the  Right Honourable St. J. Brodrick,Secretary of State for War; Field-Marshal the Earl Roberts, Commander-in-Chief;  Lieutenant-General SirW. G. Nicholson, Director-General of Mobilization and Military Intelligence.      [390]NOTE  BY  THE  SECRETARY.
    This view is based on the assumption that Russia, with France as an ally.,; would,in the case of conflict with England, have, no hesitation in forcing the Dardanelles,and would find no serious difficulty in.carrying out such an operation, with, or without,the consent of the  Turks.  Whether  she would obtain that consent would depend,of course,  upon politicaland diplomatic considerations,  which  it  is impossible toforesee.   Bur., even were Turkey&apos;unwilling  to consent to  this violation of EuropeanTreaties, we must proceed on the assumption that Russia, in the  stress  of a.  greatconflict,&apos;would not  hesitate,  did  it seem otherwise  expedient,  to  effect  a junctionbetween her Black Sea Squadron and the French Fleet in the Mediterranean.  In theopinion  of the Admiralty, the rapidity of the current flowing from the Sea of Marmorawould render it a  comparatively safe operation for them to force the Dardanelles,  andthough the return journey could not be easy and  might even be  impossible^-thiswould make comparatively little difference, as all the French ports in the Mediterraneanwould he available for their ships, either to coal or to refit.    No  doubt,  if Russia. were: established at Constantinople, co-operation with aforeign fleet  would  become  somewhat easier.  The 400  miles  of  protected watersbetween Sebastopol and the Sea  of Marmora would be saved, and any risks andcomplications arising  out of a forced: passage of the  Dardanelles would be avoided.But these advantages, though not  to be ignored, do not constitute, so far as we areconcerned, any fundamental or even very important, change in the naval problem, andwould not require us to make any substantial alteration in the number and distributionof our Mediterranean Fleet.      .                                 .  -.  Throughout the above argument, it  has been  assumed that Russia is  acting asthe ally  of France.  Were she fighting against us single-handed, it is certain that herfleet would not venture to leave the Black  Sea so long as  the  relative sea  power ofRussia and  Great Britain remained unchanged. ;    The most important corollary of the foregoing argument is, that the maintenanceof the status quo as regards Constantinople is not one of the primary interests of thiscountry;  It would carry with it, as has been pointed out above, some naval advantagesto Prussia,, and some naval disadvantages .to ourselves;  but these are not of  thedecisive  character which has sometimes been supposed.    The second question  discussed at the meeting was suggested in a private  letterof January 1901 by Sir Nicholas 0&apos;Conbr, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Constantinople,who was present during this part of the discussions of  the Defence Committee.    Sir Nicholas had asked what course this country was likely to pursue if, as mightwell  happen, disorder and anarchy broke  out at Constantinople, and  if Russia,proclaiming herself to be actiug in the interests of public order, were by a suddencoup dc main to occupy the city.   It is to be presumed that.such an occupation wouldbe (professedly at least) of a temporary character ; but in Sir Nicholas&apos;s  opinion, whenthe situation it produced came to be diplomatically dealt with by other Powers, itwould be found that Russia had practically acquired a  position from which  diplomacyalone  would be powerless to  dislodge her.  It is well known that  the  Russians  areconstantly practising in the Black Sea the rapid embarkation and disembarkation  oftroops, that they have a number of men-of-war and  transport sufficient  to  make  themaritime portion of  the operation a very simple one, and  that we could not count onmore than a week at the outside, and more  probably only on a few days, between ourfirst notice that the attempt was to be made and its successful consummation.    Sir Nicholas 0&apos;Conor seemed to contemplate the possibility of meeting a suddencontingency of this kind by a British occupation of  Gallipoli; and schemes have beenfrom time to  time suggested under which 5,000 British soldiers and marines, supportedby the fleet, are to hold the peninsula, thus making an effective counter-stroke to theRussian occupation of-Constantinople.    In the  opinion,  however, of the Defence Committee, this scheme is, in existingcircumstances, impracticable.  Even granting that 5,000 men would be sufficient  forsuch an  operation, which is probably not the case (see note at the end of the Paper), itseems more than doubtful whether they would  be forthcoming.   The fleet couldsupply no large number  of marines, and it would  be most unwise, at what wouldcertainly be a crisis of European policy, to denude either the ships of the MediterraneanFleet of an important portion of their complements, or Malta or Egypt of an equallyimportant portion of their necessary garrison.   * The current flowing through the Dardanelles makes a difference of 7 knots between the speed of asnip going up and going down the Straits.      [390]                                                          B  2
    The occupation of Lemnos, near  the mouth of the Dardanelles, would, on theother hand, be easy; but it could not, with advantage, be made permanent.  TheBritish naval position in the Mediterranean would be weakened, not  strengthened, bythe possession of another naval base, which &quot;could not be self-sufficing without costlyfortifications and a  large garrison, and which, if it were  not self-sufficing, wouldmerely be an additional anxiety to the Admiral Commanding-in-chief.    No doubt these disadvantages would not attach to a temporary occupation, butan occupation known to be temporary would be of very little use as a coercive threatto Russia, wbose Government is presumably as well acquainted as we are both withthe strength and with the weakness of  our Mediterranean position.    Hence it appears that there  is at the command of Great  Britain no effective navalor military  retort to a  coup  de main  on Constantinople.   Nor, if the argumentsdeveloped in the first part  of  this Paper are sound, is there  any reason why GreatBritain should take upon herself the burden of protecting  by her solitary exertionswhat is first a Turkish and then  a European  interest.   Our Ambassador at the Porteshould be instructed, if the  emergency arises, to urge the Sultan, or whoever on thespot seems capable of taking a decision, to adopt active measures of resistance, eitherat Constantinople or Gallipoli; and in the meanwhile, if a fitting opportunity occurs,it would  be desirable to consult  with Austria, Italy, and  possibly Erance, and otherEuropean Powers  as to the part which each was  to  play in the  case of any sucheventuality  as Sir N.  0&apos;Conor  fears;  it being  intimated to them that Great Britainwas prepared to take her share in any common action that  might be agreed on, butwas not prepared single-handed to do the work of Europe.                                                                     A. J.  B.    February 14, 1903.              NOTE BY DIRECTOR OE NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.The distance from Malta to Gallipoli is 720 miles.   NOTE BY DIRECTOR-GENERAL  OF MOBILISATION AND MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.    It is estimated that an army corps would  be  needed  effectively  to hold theGallipoli Peninsula in the face of  a Prussian occupation of Constantinople.   But it hasbeen calculated that the shortest time in which such a force  could be brought fromEngland and  landed  on the  peninsula  would  be  one month  after  the Russianoccupation had been effected.  Moreover, the dispatch of an army corj)s from Englandto Gallipoli would be conditional on our possessing complete command of the sea, andbeing free from  anxieties  in  other  parts of  the world.  The proposal to risk theseizure  of  the Gallipoli Peninsula with  a force of  only  5,000 men  presumablycontemplated the troops required being obtained from the Mediterranean garrisons.    Gibraltar is eight days from Gallipoli, and has a garrison of 5,500 all ranks.    Malta is four days from Gallipoli, and has a garrison of 10,500.    Egypt is two days from Gallipoli, and has a garrison of 5,500.    The garrisons of  Malta and  Gibraltar are fixed at  the  minimum  necessary  todefend those fortresses.  It is an accepted principle that the garrisons of  naval basesabroad should be maintained at their full strength in peace, and it would  certainly beextremely imprudent to withdraw any portion of those garrisons  at a critical period.As regards Egypt, Lord  Kitchener  was  recently  instructed to inquire into thesufficiency  of  its present garrison, in consultation with Lord Cromer, the GeneralOfficer Commanding the British garrison, and the Sirdar.   He has reported that thepresent  garrison, is inadequate to safe-guard  that country from an  over-sea raid of5,000 European troops.    It may, therefore,  be concluded that 5,000 men  could not be  withdrawn at acritical  time  from any  of the  Mediterranean garrisons  to  occupy  the GallipoliPeninsula,  even were  it considered wise to risk its  occupation by so inadequatea force.

MEMORANDUM BY  THE  DIRECTOR  OE NAVAL  INTELLIGENCE *                          &quot; FEBRUARY  1903.    WHAT would be the effect on our naval position in the Mediterranean, of :     1. Freedom of ingress and egress in respect of  the Dardanelles for the Russians ?    2. The occupation of Constantinople by the Russians ?    The effect of 1 and 2 would, as far as we were concerned, be practically identical,for Russia would gain no naval advantage by merely occupying Constantinople, andit  must be taken for granted that she would seize the Dardanelles at the same time,and hold them and the  shores of  the  Sea of Marmora, thus insuring the commandof the entire sea communications between the  Black Sea and the eastern basin ofthe Mediterranean.    This would, therefore, mean free ingress and  egress between  these seas for allRussian ships in either case.  In case 2 Russia would, however,  have the  additionaladvantage of  being able to establish  an  advance base  for  coaling  and  otherreplenishing purposes inside the  mouth of the Dardanelles, where there are severalgood anchorages, both  above and below Chanak,  Similar facilities, on  the  otherhand,  would probably be  granted by  Turkey if Russia were  made  free of  theDardanelles by friendly arrangement with that Power.    The conditions indicated under 1 and 2 would undoubtedly  improve Russia&apos;sposition in a war with England, and render our task correspondingly more difficult.    At present Russia&apos;s  naval bases in the Black Sea are some 800 miles from ourlines of communication  with India, viav Malta and  Port Said-Suez.  The mouth ofthe Dardanelles is rather more than half-way along this distance, and Russia would,therefore, with her fleet just within these Straits, be about 440 miles nearer Egypt, ora point of junction with her French ally,  than she is now.   Moreover, her fleet would.in case of defeat, or being chased back by superior force, have a secure refuge near afchand.             &apos;    Should we, in the case  of Russia occupying the Dardanelles, at once  militarilyoccupy and fortify Lemnos, Mytilene, or any  other conveniently  situated  Turkishislands ?    From a purely naval point of  view, the answer  must be in the negative.    It is a mistake to suppose that the mere possession  of  additional fortified navalbases must  necessarily  strengthen our  naval position.   Under certain conditions itmay even become a source of weakness,  for  unless absolutely able to take care ofthemselves  and to be self-supporting as regards supplies for a considerable  time,such island  bases would be a source  of anxiety  to the Admiral,  and  hamper hismovements if it should at any time be  expedient to move his  force elsewhere.    On the other hand,  so long  as ours is  the superior naval force in the Levant,these  harbours would be open to us as  anchorages and places of rendezvous forcolliers, supply-ships, &amp;c.    It may be urged that if we were notlo occupy  these  islands Russia would  do so.This is  improbable, seeing that they possess hardly any naval  advantage over theDardanelles anchorages, whilst the force occupying them  would run grave  risks ofbeing cut off by our superior fleet.    There can also be no doubt that the  seizure of any of  these islands by us in timeof peace would stir up much ill-feeling against us on the Continent.    The next question which arises is whether Russia is likely to be in active alliancewith France at the moment supposed or not.   If Russia thus  cleared her way into theMediterranean it could only be done with some ulterior object, and it is inconceivablethat she would be prepared to pit her Black Sea squadron against our Mediterraneanfleet.   It may therefore be taken for granted that we should have to reckon withFrance  at the same time.  The fleet of that country would then remain, as before,the main objective of our fleet, and until  that force had been accounted for, we shouldnot be able to do more than watch the Prussians in the Levant.                       * Captain H.S.H. Prince Louis of  Battenberg.   -
     To consider now the effect upon such a situation if we found ourselves in alliance&quot;with one or other of the European Powers :      Germany, Austria, and Italy the Triple Alliance might possibly be on our sideas against the &quot; Dual&quot; Alliance.  This would materially affect the naval situation inthe Mediterranean, as the  co-operation of the  Italian fleet against the French forces inthe western basin would enable us to detach sufficient ships, together with the Austrianfleet, to paralyse the Prussian Black  Sea  forces.   The Austrian army would also, nodoubt, be  able  to act against any Prussian forces advancing from  Constantinople.Germany \vould have her  hands full on shore, and her fleet would have to be kept inher home waters.     Howrever, such a big  combination  against Erance and Prussia appears extremelyunlikely.   Germany alone certainly would not run such risks for the mere purpose offrustrating &quot;Russia in her  endeavour to improve her naval position in the Near East,where the former has no real interests ; besides which her position between Prussia anaErance compels her to keep  on good terms with the former at any price.     Austria  alone would  not be of any material assistance, as her fleet is not evenequal to coping with the Russian Black Sea squadron.     Italy&apos;s  help would, as  has been  said, be very valuable; how far we could countupon it, it is not for the Admiralty to say.     Supposing that Russia had  somehow secured the waterway between the BlackSea and the Levant, was firmly established in the narrow waters at either end of theSea of Marmora, and that the general peace  of Europe had not been disturbed, whatwould be the further development ?   Would Russia extend her power along the shoresof Macedonia in one direction, and of Asia Minor  in the other ?  The former mustbring her into conflict, sooner or later, with Austria, whilst the latter might embroilher with Germany over the Bagdad Railway, and  certainly with France as  Syria wasapproached.     However, these are speculations somewhat outside the scope of this Paper.     To sum up :      It may be stated generally that a Russian occupation of the Bosphorus and theDardanelles,  or  an  arrangement for  enabling Russia  to  freely use the  waterwaybetween the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, such as her dominating influence canextract from Turkey at her pleasure, would  not  make  any marked difference in ourstrategic dispositions as compared with present conditions.   It is true that the enemywould, at  the outset,  be nearer the  theatre  of  war.   But  he  requires  now,quite  as much  as  under the  altered conditions, a close  watch  by  our  ships.He  may attempt  a  raid  by  one  or  two fast  ships  on Port Said,  in  hopes ofdamaging the Suez  Canal.  This is  not probable, as such a  deed  would bringRussia in conflict with all maritime  Powers.  The real point to  remember is thatin either case Russia  cannot hope to  effect anything serious,  be it in  Egypt orelsewhere, until her  fleet has fought and beaten our fleet.  Anything undertaken bythe Russian Black Sea Admiral in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean whilst ourmain fleet wras occupied  wdth the French to the westward  could, unless we  weredefeated by the French, only end as did Adrniral Persano&apos;s attempt  upon  Lissa in1866, even if a repetition of  Bonaparte&apos;s expedition to Egypt in 1798 were consideredtoo much to hope for.
