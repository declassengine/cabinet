Lloyd George, Chancellor                    of the Exchequer.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,           January 1, 1915.BBlllBli^
SECRET.SUGGESTIONS AS TO  THE  MILITARY  POSITION.    NOW that the New Armies are in course of training and will, with the Territorials,.be ready by the end of March to the extent of at least half a million men,T suggest thatit is time the Government should take  counsel with the  military experts as to the usewhich  shall be made of this  magnificent force.  It is a  force of  a totally differentcharacter from any which has hitherto left these shores.  . It has been drawn almostexclusively from the better class of artisan, the upper and the lower middle classes.   Inintelligence, education, and character it is vastly superior to any army ever raised in this1countrv, and  as it has been di*awn not from the ranks of those who  have generally&apos;cutthemselves off from home ties and about whose fate there is therefore, not the same.anxiety at home, the people of this country will take an intimate personal interest in.its  fate of a kind which they have never displayed before in our military, expeditions:So  that  if this superb army is thrown away upon futile enterprises, such as those wehave witnessed during the last few weeks, the country will be uncontrollably indignantat the lack of prevision and intelligence shown in our plans. I may add that  operations.buch as those we have witnessed during the past few. months will inevitably destroy themoral  of the  best of troops.   Good soldiers will face any; dangers and  endure &quot;any.hardships which promise  ultimate progress, but this intermittent flinging,.themselves-against impregnable positions breaks the stoutest hearts in the end.    There are therefore three or four considerations  I wish to urge on the militarysituation.                                    1 \ &apos;                                 \                        1.  Stalemate on the Western Front.. .    I cannot pretend  to have any military knowledge, but.the little I saw and gatheredin France as to the military position, coupled with such reading on the subject as I havebeen able to indulge in, convinced me that any  attempt to force  the carefully-prepared:German lines in the west wrould end in failure and in appalling loss of life, and I thenexpressed this  view  to my  colleagues.   General  Foch told  me that there would, be;no more retreats on the French side, and  I could well appreciate&apos; his confidence afterI had  driven past trench behind trench from Paris all the way to the Aisne.  TheFrench Generals  are  confident  that even  if  the whole  of  the German  army  nowoccupied in Poland were thrown on the western  front, the French  and British troopswould   still be able  to  hold their  own.  The same   observation,   of course,  mustapply  to the German  military position.  We were  told the other day  that  theGermans  had, during  the   last  few  months,  prepared a  series  of  trenches  ofthe  same  kind  on  their  side  right  up  to the Rhine.   After  three or  fourmonths of the most tenacious fighting, involving very heavy losses, the French have notat any one point on the  line gained a couple  of miles.   Would the throwing  of anadditional half-million men on this front make  any real  difference ?   To force the lineyou Avould require at least three to one ;  our reinforcements would not guarantee twoto one, or anything approaching such a predominance.   Is it not therefore better thatwe should recognise the impossibility of this particular task, and try and think out someway by which the distinct numerical  advantage which the  Allies will have attained  afew months hence can be rendered effective ?           2. Extension, and consequent Attenuation, of Enemy s Front.     Another consideration which ought to weigh with us is the importance of attenuatingthe enemy&apos;s line by forcing him largely to extend it.  The Germans now defend a frontof 600 miles.  No wastage in sight will so reduce their forces to such numbers as wouidmake  any part of this line untenable.   The French returns of wounded prove  that79 per cent, of the wounded return to the line ; 54  per cent, of the French woundedhave already returned ; 25 per cent, are convalescent and will soon  be back.  It is  afundamental mistake  always committed by the press to  exaggerate the  eiiemys losses ;
the slight and curable character of most  wounds is  always overlooked^  But if thelength^f the German line is doubled, even at the present  rate of attrition, it mightbecome at an early date so thin as to be easily penetrable.              3. Forcing the Enemy to Fight on Unfavourable Ground.    The enemy is now fighting  in country which is admirably adapted to his presententrenching tactics.   He. would be at  a  disadvantage if he were forced to fight inthe open.              4. Necessity of  Winning a Definite Victory somewhere.    There is another consideration which  is  political  as  well  as  military, but whichnevertheless  cannot  be overlooked in an  exhausting war like this, where we have tosecure continuous exertion  and sacrifice on  the  part of our  people, and where wehave  also  to think  of hesitating  neutrals with large,  armies who  are still  indoubt  as  to their  action.   There  is a real  danger  that  the  people  of GreatBritain and of France will sooner or later  get tired of long casualty  lists explainedby  monotonous   and  rather   banal  telegrams  from  headquarters about &quot; heavycannonades,&quot; &quot;making a  little  progress&quot; at certain points, &quot; recovering,  trenches,&quot;the loss  of  which has never  been reported, &amp;c, with the net  result  that we have&apos;not advanced a yard  after weeks of heavy  fighting.  Britishers have ceased to betaken in by reports which exaggerate  slight  successes and  suppress reverses:  neutralStates have never been deceived by these reports.   The public will soon realise that theGermans are now in effective occupation of a  larger proportion of Allied  territory thanthey were in possession of at  the date of the Battle of  the Aisne.  This is  true ofBelgium, of France,  and  of Poland.  These  occupied  territories  contain  some of therichest coalfields and industrial centres in Europe, and  the most sanguinary attackshave not succeeded in moving the Germans (on an average) a single yard out of theseterritories.   A  clear  definite. victory which has visibly  materialised in guns andprisoners captured, in unmistakable retreats of the enemy&apos;s armies,  and in large sections :of enemy, territory occupied, will alone satisfy the public that tangible results are being-achieved by the great sacrifices they are making, and decide neutrals that it is at lastsafe for them to  throw in their lot with us.                           5.  An Alternative Suggestion.    Inasmuch as these  objects cannot be accomplished  by attacks on  the westernfront, some alternative ought to be sought.  I venture  to make one or two  suggestions.I have heard of  a proposal that there should be ah attack in the direction  of Denmarkupon  the north  coast of Germany.   This proposal  is associated with the name ofLord Fisher.  For the moment  I cannot venture to express  any opinion upon it,  as Ishould like  to  know more about  the  military  and naval  possibilities  of such  anenterprise.  It strikes me as being very hazardous, and by no means certain to fulfilthe purpose which its originators have in  view.   Schleswig-Holstein, with its narrow:neck, could  be   easily  aefended  by a  comparatively small German  force, stronglyentrenched against a hostile army seeking to advance into Prussian territory, and thereis no room  for flanking operations.  But at  the present  moment  I would rather riotcriticise this plan.  My purpose is rather  to put  forward  another  alternative, and \think more promising scheme for consideration by the Prime Minister and  his advisers.It would involve two independent operations which would have the common purpose ofbringing  Germany down  by the  process of  knocking the  props  under her, and  thefurther purpose of so compelling her  to attenuate her line  of defence  as to make. it.more easily  penetrable.   I will explain  these  two propositions in  a  little  moredetail.&apos;                              6.  The First Operation.    ^ I suggestthat our new forces should  be  employed in an attack upon Austria: inconjunction with the Serbians, the Roumanians, and  the Greeks.  The assistance ofthe two  latter countries  would  be assured if they knew that  a  great  English  forcewould be there to support them.  Roumania could put 300,000 men in the field, whilstretaining a sufficient force to keep the Bulgarians in check.  As this move might decidethe Bulgarians to remain honestly neutral, the Roumanians could spare another 200,000.The Greeks and Montenegrins have an  army  of  200,000  available.   How many  mencould we spare ?  By the beginning of April we shall have in this  countrv 700,000 men       [151]                          *                                 B 2
who will have undergone a six months&apos;training.   Of these,  400,000 would be  Terri-torials, 200,000 of whom will have been in camp continuously for eight months.  We shallhave in France a force of 800,000 men, provided we do not  waste it on barbed  wire.The French can easily defend their lines against the troops which Germany can sparefrom defending  Silesia after the Austrian armies have been withdrawn to defend  theirsouthern frontier.  We should  require 200.000 experienced  troops  to: stifle11 the newarmies.  We should thus have a force of 1,000,000 available.  400.000 men  might beleft here as  a reserve to throw  into France in case of need if  the French were, hardpressed before the southern diversion against  Austria had  developed.  Some  of themmight be sent to Boulogne so as to be at hand  in case of emergency.- .  Subsequently thisforce could be used to reinforce the new Expeditionary Force from.time to time.   Thiswould leave 600,000 available for the Austrian expedition.  -Gradually this&apos; force couldbe increased as the New Armies were equipped.                    ....&apos;.&apos;.-..  ...&apos;: - - -     This would mean an  army of between  1,400,000 and 1,600,000 men to attack^Austria on her most vulnerable frontier.  Here the  population is almost entirely friendly,consisting as it does of Slavonic  races who hate both. the Germans  and the  Magyars.1We could send our troops up either through Salonica or,-1 believe, by landing  thenronthe  Dalmatian coast.   We could seize islands there which might make-an admirablebase for supplies not far removed from the railway, through Bosnia&apos; into --Austria:&apos;-This&apos;:operation would force the Austrians to detach a considerable army from the -defence. of:Cracow, and thus leave  Silesia  undefended.   The  Austrians. could, not withdraw, thewhole  of their army to face this  new attack, because in. that; case the Russians  couldpour through the  Carpathians  and captureeither -&quot;Vienna; or . Budapest.The  frontwiiich  would  be developed Avould be  much  .too  lengthy, for. the Austrian. forces toentrench  and  hold.  The Germans  would  be compelled either to  send-.large-forcesto   support  their  Austrian  allies or  to  abandon  them.  In the; first- case  theGermans  would have to hold an enormous&apos; length  of extended front, in&apos;the. aggregate1,200  miles,  and  the Allies would, for the.  first, time,, enjoy, the full advantage-of the  superior numbers which by that time they can:put  into the field. ..The Germanswould  also render themselves liable to a dangerous  attack, in the-rearfrom the immenseforces which by that date Russia will have placed in the.field.&apos;-; Oh the other hand, if theGermans decline to quit their own frontiers, and, leave the-. Austrlaiis  to; their fate, thatempire would be rapidly disposed  of as a military., entity,;and..about 2,500-000::men(including Russians), engaged in the task of attacking- it. wonld::be -free to. assail theGermans.                                        &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;-&apos;--:-/-[:&apos;-&apos;-&apos;-&apos;&apos;--&apos;&apos;&apos;?:/\&apos;&apos;\&apos;-.&apos;&apos;                    7.  Two Incidental Advantages of this Course.   ,&quot;:           .     1. Something which could be called a victory would  be thus, within our reach, andthe  public would  be satisfied  to support with all,their  resources the conduct of thewar for a much  longer period without grumbling or stint.  &apos;.     2. Italy would not only be encouraged by this formidable demonstration, she wouldbe forced to come in in her own interest, because  the. operations would be conductedlargely along the coast which  she. is looking  forward to  annexing to her. kingdom, asthe  population is predominantly Italian.   She must view  with very great jealousy1 anyoccupation of this territory by  Serbian troops, and Italian  public opinion would&apos; not .countenance any proposal on the part of the  Italian Ministry to come  to  the aid  ofAustria  if we made it clear that the  whole of.  this  littoral.would become Italianterritory if Italy helped to conquer it.                    &quot;- .&apos;.&apos;.&apos;-          -&apos;  .; &apos;                             8. The Second  Operation..  -      ;  -     This involves an attack upon Turkey.  There  are four  conditions which an attackon Turkey ought, in my judgment,  to fulfil :-     1. That it should not involve the absorption of such a large force as to weaken our            offensive in the main field of opertions ;     2. That wre should  operate at a  distance which would not be  far  from  the sea,            so as  not to  waste  too many of our  troops in  maintaining long lines of           communication and  so  as also to have the  support of  the Fleet in any           eventualities.     3. That it should  have the effect of forcing  Turkey to  fight at a long  distance           from her  base of supplies and in country which  would be disadvantageous           to her.
     4. That it should give us the chance of winning  a  dramatic victory which  would           encourage our people at home, whilst it would be a corresponding discourage-           ment to our enemies.  .... Perhaps I ought to add a fifth : it would be a great advantage from this  point ofview if it were in territory which appeals to the imagination of the people as a whole.     What operations would meet these conditions ?  It is supposed that the Turks are.gathering together a great army for the invasion of Egypt.   The sections show that they.have collected  something  like 80.000 troops in Syria, and  that they are slowly movingthem along towards the Egyptian frontier.   I would  let them  entangle themselves inthis  venture, and whilst they were engaged in attacking our forces on the Suez Canal,I would suggest that a force of 100,000 should be landed in Syria to cut them off.They, could not  maintain themselves  in that  country  very long  once their railwaycommunications  were  cut.  They would  therefore  be.forced  either  to  fight  or to.surrender.  The distance from Constantinople to Syria would not permit them to bringup reinforcements  in time to produce  any impression upon the situation.   A force of80,000 Turks would be wiped out and the whole  of Syria would  fall into our hands.The  pressure upon Russia in the Caucasus would be relieved;  the Turkish  army inEurope could not effectively  attach our lines of communication as they would be boundto take steps to redeem the situation in Syria, and, if possible, recover the country.;     Unless we are prepared for some project of this character I frankly despair of ourachieving  any  success  in this war.  I can see nothing but an eternal stalemate on anyother lines.  The  process of economic exhaustion  alone  will not bring us a triumphantpeace as long as Germany is  in  possession of these rich  allied territories.   No countryhas  ever given in under such pressure, apart from  defeat in  the field.  Burke wasalways indulging in prophecies of victory as a result of France&apos;s exhaustion.  The warwith France went on. for twenty years after  he indulged in  his futile  predictions.-Germany and  Austria between them have 3,000,000 young men quite as well trained asthe men of the Kitchener  Armies, ready to take the place of the men now in the trencheswhen these fall.  At that rate the process of exhaustion will take at least ten years.  Insoil,  in minerals, in scientific equipment, Germany is a country of: enormous resources..In the  number of men who have a scientific training it is infinitely the richest country inthe world.  That must not be left out of  account when we talk about  the process ofexhaustion.  No doubt they will suffer a good deal from lack of copper.   We must notdepend too much on this.  German industries dependent on copper will  suffer, but oneway or another copper  will be found for ammunition.  Copper in small quantities willget in  through neutral  countries : neutrals cannot.resist  the prices offered by Germanyfor their copper supplies.   Moreover, they have some copper mines in Germany.  Someof them were working  at a profit at the date  of  the  war.  There must be many morelower  grade copper mines which  would  not  have  paid  under  ordinary conditions,just   like  the   copper   mines  of   North  Wales,   but  which   would  become&apos;immediately   profitable  when   the   price   of  copper  is   doubled  or   trebled.Moreover  they have inexhaustible supplies of coal and iron, and as long as they have.the Hungarian plains they can frugally feed themselves.   There is an enthusiasm and, a-spirit,  according  to every testimony, which cannot be worn down by a two&apos;or threeyears&apos;  siege of German armies  entrenched  in  enemy territory.   The German spirit willnot be broken  by. the bombardment of  Dixmude or Roulers.     We cannot  allow things to drift.  We ought to look well ahead and discuss evervpossible project for bringing the war to  a successful conclusion.  Supply and ammunitiondifficulties, severe  economic pressure,  financial  embarrassments,  even  privation anddistress nations will face them  cheerfully as long as their armies in the field are inunbeaten  possession of their enemies&apos; land.  But once defeat  which is unmistakablecomes  their way, moderate economic troubles make a deep impression on their judgment.Such defeats are not to be compassed along our present lines of attack, and we ought toseek others.     If a decision were come to in favour of some such plan of campaign as I haveoutlined,  it will  take weeks  to make the necessary preparations for it.   I cannotrecollect that in our discussions at the C.I.D. such an operation was ever contemplated.The ground has therefore not been surveyed.   It,  would take some time to collect thenecessary intelligence  as to the country, so as to decide where to land the Army andwhat shall be  the line of attack.  Transport would have to be  carefully and  secretlygathered.  Large forces might have to be accumulated in the Mediterranean, ostensiblyfor Egypt.  It might be  desirable to send an advance  force through Salonica to assistSerbia.  Military arrangements would have to be  made with Roumania, Serbia, Greece,
and, perhaps, Italy.  All this must take time.  Expeditions decided upon and organisedwith insufficient care and  preparation  generally end disastrously.   And as similarconsiderations will probably apply to any alternative  campaign, I urge the importanceof our taking counsel and pressing to a decision without deky.
