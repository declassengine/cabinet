Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence. March 1915.SECRET.G-12.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE THE  WAR Alexandretta and Mesopotamia Memorandum by Lord Kitchener 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,             March 16, 1915.
ALEXANDRETTA AND  MESOPOTAMIA.   ASSUMING that the war is brought to a successfulconclusion, a partition of a certain part of  the Turkishdominions will doubtless have to be undertaken.  Russia,we know, will secure Constantinople together with  thecontrol  of  the Dardanelles  and the Bosphorus.  It issafe to assume that the claims of Syria, which the Frenchhave  put forward for so many years, will have  to besatisfied to a considerable extent.   With Russia estah-lished on the Dardanelles and with France in possessionof Syria, the strategical and economic situation in  theLevant  cannot fail to be profoundly modified, and  theposition  of Egypt  will  be considerably  affected.   Itmust  not be forgotten that, after the conclusion of peace,old enmities and jealousies which have been stilled bythe existing crisis in  Europe, may revive.  We have, infact, to  assume that, at some  future date, we may findourselves  at enmity  with Russia, or with  France,  orwith both in combination, and we must bear this possi-bility in mind in deciding how,  when the time  forsettlement comes and  the  question of the partition ofTurkey  in Asia arises, our interests can best be safe-guarded.   2. It is obvious that in consequence of Russia havingbecome  a Mediterranean Power, with a capacity to sendfleets at will out of the  safe  refuge  afforded by  theDardanelles, and  of  France having  established  herselfin Syria in close proximity to  the  Nile  Delta, the stra-tegicai situation in Egypt will be considerably influenced;for should, we at any time find ourselves in oppositionto either or both of  these two  Great Powers, our com-munications with India bv the Suez  Canal mis-lit beseriously endangered and  Egypt itself might be placedin considerable jeopardy.   Egypt  possesses no goodnaval ports, and labours  under the  disadvantage ofoffering considerable stretches of coast-line  favourablefor the  disembarkation of  troops by an enemy  medi-tating attack.  On  the other  hand,  the coast of Syrialikewise offers  no  srood natural harbours  and  anchor-ages,  and, provided that French control were confinedto Syria Proper, the  situation would lose at least someof its dangers.   The question of a British occupation of Alexandrettaentirely depends upon the  future of Mesopotamia,  for,if there is no intention  of acquiring  the  EuphratesValley  as  a  result of -this  war,  the occupation  ofAlexandretta would  mean  the  establishment  of  adangerous  outpost,  and involve us  in  responsibilitieswith no commensurate advantage.  But if the acquisitionof Mesopotamia is contemplated, it at once becomes  anecessity to hold Alexandretta with a British force.   It is, perhaps, necessary to explain in more  detailwhy this  should be.   In case of war with the  Powersmentioned above, a demand for reinforcing Mesopotamiawould almost inevitablv arise, as well as the need  to re-mforce  Egypt.  India cannot be depended upon to do    [417]                                  B 2
2both, and  possibly might not be able to do either.  Tobring troops from the United Kingdom to Mesopotamia,via the Suez Canal, Red  Sea, and Persian Gulf, wouldtake nearly a fortnight longer than to move them toAlexandretta and thence by rail.  Moreover, the enemyespecially  to  be borne in mind is obviously Russia, andit so happens that any advance by Russian forces fromthe highlands of  Armenia and Kurdistan must followcertain  well-defined routes  leading  southwards, withtheir  flank exposed  to a  British advance from aboutAleppo;  the possession of  Alexandretta and  Aleppowould, in  fact,  place  us  in a particularly  favourablestrategical position for countering  any offensive on  thepart of the  enemy.  Another important  advantagearising from  the  possession  of Alexandretta would bethat the traffic of arms and ammunition to the Aral) tribesof Mesopotamia could be controlled at the Mediterraneanas well as the  Persian  Gulf  end.    Furthermore,, ithas been  pointed out above  that  the  possession  ofAlexandretta means a saving of  time  in  respect ofreinforcing Mesopotamia  from  the  United  Kingdomin times of emergency, and  from this it follows that asmaller  garrison  would suffice in ordinary times  forMesopotamia, resulting in  a permanent financial savingon the cost of administrating this great territory.   The question  will  then  arise, why should we takeMesopotamia ?  Would it not be  better  to leave  ourfrontier as it is  now in  Egypt, naturally defended bythe Sinai desert ?   But if we do not take Mesopotamia,the Russians undoubtedly will sooner  or later.  Thiswould give them  an outlet into the  Persian Gulf, andenable them eventually to  control the military situationand the greater part of its commerce.   Our interests  in  the Persian Gulf are of very  oldstanding,  and our prestige  as an  Asiatic Power isinseparably bound up  with  our domination of thosewaters; but such domination would cease were Bagdadand Basra to be in the hands of Russia.  So long as  theOttoman  Empire  controls  the lower valleys  of  theEuphrates  and  Tigris, we may rest content with  thesituation as it is, but if the  Ottoman Empire is to bewholly or  partially  broken  up, it is imperative thatMesopotamia should become  British.   Again, should the partition,  of. Turkey take place, itis to our interests to  see an  Arab kingdom establishedin Arabia under the auspices  of England, bounded onthe north  by the valley of  the Tigris and Euphrates, andcontaining within it the chief  Mahommedan  HolyPlaces, Mecca, Medina, and  Kerbala.  In this eventu-ality the possession of Mesopotamia-as we already holdthe Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and Egypt would secureall  the  approaches to  the Mahommedan Holy  Places.This, in our position  as the greatest  of Moslem States,would greatly enhance our prestige amongst the manymillions of our Mahommedan subjects.   3.  Strong arguments  can be adduced for incorpo-rating Mesopotamia in the Empire merely  on  thegrounds of its potential agricultural resources.   It isuniversally recognised  that this region only stands inneed of irrigation and of scientific development to becomeagain one of the most fertile and  highly productiveareas in the world.  But even stronger arguments canhe adduced on the grounds that this, at present thinlypopulated  and  unproductive tract provides  an  almost
 ideal field of  colonisation for the  surplus population of India, and that its possession would help to solve one of the most serious  problems with  which  the  Indian Government is confronted.    Its possession is also necessary to guard our interests in the Persian oil fields, and to  control the land route from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, which will eventually become our most direct and quickest line of communication with India.  This land route, if it were made to follow the  line from Aleppo direct east to the Euphrates,  and then the valley of that river to Bagdad, would be  guarded on both flanks by a desert, the best of all defences against attack.    It may he observed that, if  Alexandrefcta is to be permanently  occupied,  only a  limited  area of  the hinterland need  become ^British territory in addition to the shores of the  Gulf of  Iskanderun.  In the region incorporated  by us it would be necessary to include Aleppo  as  well as Aintab  and  perhaps Marash,  but there would seem to be no need to appropriate the whole of the  existing  Aleppo Vilayet,  and  only the eastern portion of the Adana Vilayet ought to be incorporated. But  the object of  occupying   Alexandretta and its environs would  not merely  be to deprive other Great Powers of the place.   It also affords a natural Mediter- ranean terminus for the Bagdad Hallway, running from -the  Mediterranean to Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf and India; it offers an excellent anchorage for trans- ports and for  merchant shipping;  it lends itself readily to defence by  shore batteries. The great cost of harbour works and fortifications,  and  the  maintenance of a garrison in Alexandretta  will not fall on this country, as they can, and should, be met from  the development of  the  enormous  natural  resources  of  Mesopotamia. Probably  it  would be  unnecessary  to  provide such defences before a  considerable  development had taken place.    5. It may  now be desirable to  touch briefly on some of the objections which may be raised  against acquiring Alexandretta; the first and obvious  one  is that its acquisition, and  the acquisition  of Mesopotamia, will mean a considerable addition to our Imperial responsi- bilities, will call for  special  military  dispositions, and may necessitate  the creation of  fresb military forces. This cannot be gainsaid.  But it may be observed that, in so far as military forces for garrisoning this  region are concerned, it ought, after a short time, to become self-supporting in  view of  its  great  natural wealth, and because  of the  useful  material  for   creating troops to be  found among  its  inhabitants.    Alexan- dretta itself is readily defensible  against  attack from any side.   Mesopotamia also, in  spite of its great area, is, comparatively speaking, easily,  defended  so long as the waterways of the Tigris and Euphrates are secure, because of the great mountain  bulwark to the north, and of  the few  routes  which  lead  down from that upland tract.   6.  The area which it is here proposed to incorporate undoubtedly offers a  prolonged  fiank to Russia  forpossible attack from the side of Armenia and Kurdistan, and to this extent it produces an  unsatisfactory strate- gical  situation.   But it seems to be a choice  of evils. It is  a  question of gaming definite control  over  thegreat line of communications to  India,  although that    [417]
line is to some extent exposed to risk of being severed intime of war, or to leave that line permanently to anotherGreat  Power  or  Great  Powers,  which would thusdominate  the   Mediterranean  terminus.  It  shouldobviously be no part  of  our  programme to  Create afrontier  conterminous  with that - of Russia;  but it isto  be  hoped  that  sufficient remains  of the  OttomanEmpire will be left to  ensure  a Turkish  or Armenianbuffer  State stretching from  Anatolia to the Persianborder.   But,  even   a frontier  conterminous   withRussia,   with  all  its  grave   drawbacks,  would  bepreferable  to  a  Eranco-Russian  domination of  theline from the Gulf of Iskanderun to the Persian Gulf.    7. The  point then  suggests itself that the Erenchwill naturally  desire  to  possess Alexandretta.   ButAlexandretta is quite outside Syria, so that the Erenchhave no real established  claim to or  influence in theplace, nor would they seem ever to have contemplated itsacquisition in the past.   We may he bound to deal gene-rously wdth our Ally in  such matters; but Syria alone willwell repay them without any extension northwards intoadjacent territory.   But it is not only in Turkey in Asiathat there is likely to be territory to divide up at the endof the war.  There are also  the German colonies  inAfrica, some of which  will, as far as can be foreseen atpresent, be at the disposal of the Allies when the settle-ment  comes.  These German  African possessions  areno  doubt of value to whatever Power eventually retainsthem, but it would be  absurd to compare their value tothe British Empire with  that  of  Alexandretta, Meso-potamia, and the Bagdad Railway, and  with all thattheir possession would mean as a security to Egypt andthe Suez Canal, as wrell as  to India.
