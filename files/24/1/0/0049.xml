 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government       Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  December&quot;1915.SECRET.G.-44.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.An Appreciation of the  Situation in Mesopotamia.By General Sir E. G. Barrow, G.C.B., Military Secretary,                    India Office.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,          November 29, 1915.
APPRECIATION.     GENERAL TOWNSHEND,  with 7,500  men  and 34  guns, is - concentrated atAziziyeh.  The enemy are at  Bostan, Ctesiphon, and Lajj, with  an estimated force of12,000 men and 39 guns.   At Aziziyeh and Kut-el-Amara we have forces  as infootnote.*  After  their defeat on the 22nd November the enemy are probably in nocondition to  attack till  reinforced in men,  supplies, and  munitions,  and  they arecertainly not at present in a  condition to follow up in  force any retirement we mayfeel compelled to make.     Both as regards aeroplanes  and cavalry we have the advantage  from the point ofview  of  reconnoitring  power, while our command of the  river enables  us to  evacuateour advanced position without much loss of material.     Whether it is intended to stand  at  Aziziyeh till the  reinforcements arrive, orwhether  we propose to retire to  Kut, 60 miles lower down, is  not yet known here, andprobably has not yet been decided by General Nixon.     2. Reinforcements  will begin to arrive about the 6th at Basra, viz., Younghusband&apos;sBrigade  irom  Egypt and some of the regiments from  India,  so by  the middle  ofDecember General  Nixon  should  have collected an  appreciable force  of fresh  troopsnear Kut-el-Amara, viz., 14th Hussars, 9 battalions infantry, and 3 batteries Territorialfield artillery,  provided he has sufficient river transport to convey them,  which isdoubtful.     There will also be at or about  Basra 2 regiments  cavalry, 3  batteries R.F.A.,and 4 battalions infantry by the  15th December.   Some of Townshend&apos;s regiments, thosewhich have suffered most, will probably be sent back to rest and recuperate, so that thenet addition to the force actually at the front will not be very  considerable.     3. By the  middle of December, according to  General Nixon, the Turks may haveconcentrated  27,000 men  and 55 guns, while  by that time Townshend&apos;s force  maybe as much as 12,000 men.  It is possible that by then the Turks may be concentratedin sufficient  strength  to attack us,  but the  further we  are  from Bagdad, the morehazardous will it be for them to follow us up, on account of the difficulty of transport,more especially if our aviators are able to bomb some of  their few remaining  steameisand barges.  Consequently I do  not anticipate any immediate  cause for anxiety.    4. By the  1st January we may hope that  at least the whole of the Meerut divisionand the two emergency brigades from  India will have arrived at the theatre of  war.This will give  General  Nixon  an addition  of about 18,000  men  to  his  present force,and, as it is unlikely after their experiences at Kut-el-Amara and Ctesiphon  that  theTurks will attack him with less  than a two to one superiority, I  think we may reasonablyhope that no serious attack will be made upon him before the New Year, by which time wemay expect that he will be fully  prepared to meet it.    5. I have frequently pointed out  the strategic advantage of the &quot; Kut&quot;  position.A force posted  there in the loop  between the  Tigris and the Shatt-el-Hai  is in anextraordinarily  strong position if it has the  command of the waterways, as  we have.The  position  is one that  cannot readily be turned, while our communications by theTigris are fairly secure.   The tactical value of the position can  scarcely be demonstratedwithout  local   knowledge, but,  strategically  speaking, it seems  to  offer advantagescomparable in  a sense  to those presented  to Wellington  by Torres Vedras,  andtherefore the desirability  of preparing a fortified  position at  Kut-el-Amara  suggests                  * Aziziyeh. 9 squadrons, 16 battalions, 37 guns.

itself.  Apart from its military value, the situation has the further political advantagethat it covers the whole of the Basra vilayet and  indirectly protects the Anglo-Persianoilfield from Turkish  attack.  For  these reasons I think we should urge on the IndianGovernment  the importance of at once  preparing  a  position there, whether GeneralNixon intends to fight at  Aziziyeh or not; just as Wellington prepared Torres Vedrason which to fall back, though he elected to fight a retarding action at Busaco.     6. There  is another point I would again  bring  to the Secretary of States notice.Some weeks ago I suggested that the  brigade  at  Nasiiiyah should  be withdrawn witha  view  to reinforcing  General  Nixon.  The  Viceroy  disliked  the  suggestion.*Nevertheless, the irony of events has shown that  we should now be in afar less anxiousposition if that brigade had been echeloned along the Tigris communications instead  ofbeing locked up  in an isolated position on the Euphrates, where it will be exposed  toattack and cannot easily be reinforced.     7. The only real anxiety  to  my  mind is the  state  of India.   Two brigades  o^infantry and a brigade of artillery, as well as two  cavalry regiments, will -have beentemporarily lost  to its defence, and therefore  the urgent  need  of an increase to theBritish garrison, which I pressed in my minute of the 28th November, will have beengreatly accentuated.                                                                        E. G. B.     November 29, 1915. * See telegrams to Viceroy, No. 3122, November 8,1915 ; from Viceroy, No. II. 9125, November 15,1915.        Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, dated                                November 8,  J 915.    3122.  Your H. 6793 of 5th August.    Please consider whether necessity of holding Nasiriyah in force will  not disappearwhen we occupy Bagdad.  It seems undesirable to lock up a brigade in that  area if itcan be avoided.                   ,              Telegram from Viceroy, dated Delhi, November 15, 1915.                                                                               ;j    H.  9125.   Reference to your telegram of the 8th instant, No. 3122.    It is not for us to express an opinion as to  the necessity of occupying Nasiriyah inforce under the circumstances you mention, but our views are as follows :     1.   We  do not propose  to  interfere with the  dispositions  of the General OfficerCommanding in the  field, particularly when  he is fully alive  to the  desirability  ofconcentrating all his disposable forces at  the decisive point.    2.  As explained in my telegram of the 4th August, in which we repeated Nixonstelegram on the subject, Nasiriyah is important as dominating local Arabs.  A weak orunoccupied Nasiriyah  would also be a focus for  Arab  gatherings, and in particular abait for Ajaimi.    3.  Improved land communication would reduce force necessary to hold  Nasiriyah,but for reasons of expense we are not at present proceeding with railway suggested byNixon in his above-quoted telegram.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C.
