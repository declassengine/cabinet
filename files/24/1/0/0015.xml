REMARKS  ON   THE   IMPORTANCE   OF  ALEXANDRETTA AS  A FUTURE BASE..   THE numerous short appreciations of the Syrianquestion recently  put forward  by various  authoritieshave clearly  brought out. that  the small but ancientTurkish  town of  Alexandretta is of  increasing im-portance in the future political and commercial develop-ment of  the  East, and that in the past it has hardlybeen given sufficient attention, except  on the part of afew far-seeing individuals.   This is not astonishing, as for several centuries thisobscure and  unimportant place has  had little or noinfluence on world politics, and its acquisition for any-thing but purely aggressive  purposes  would have beenof: little value to any but the present possessors.   The bay on which it is  situated has, however, somedistinctly noticeable features,  it being  one of the fewlarge commodious  open anchorages in the world whichis a safe anchorage at  all times of the year, withoutartificial protection in the shape of breakwaters, and itis remarkably free vfrom outlying  dangers,  fogs, andheavy swells,  which are  so  detrimental  to the develop-ment of  a  port removed from  the vicinity of ordinarytrade routes,  and which mark  the  Bay  of Alexandrettaas superior to any others on the Syrian coast.   During the last few years,  moreover, the situationhas changed  and the importance of  this position hasincreased, and will surely tend to increase rapidly inthe future.   This gradual change is due to GermanEastern  policy and the development of the Persian-oilfields,  on which it is unnecessary to  enlarge.   German policy  initiated the. Bagdad Railway;  and,,tvhatever the result of the war, this  line ought to be-ind will surely be completed from economic reasons, and t will remain a tangible result of German aspirations.for obtaining an outlet  to the  sea to east  of Aden indirect communication with her home industrial  provinces.   Though the German aspirations for eastern expansionmay for a time be checked as far as aggressive militarypolicy is concerned, there is no reason why her  legitimateendeavours in the fertile regions of Mesopotamia shouldnot revive in the  near future, and  be  evidenced by hermethod of peaceful penetration applied at Alexandretta,unless  we  are in a  position  to check them  at  thatconvenient starting-point.   But Germany is hot the only opponent to consider.Unless the status quo in Syria is maintained, the Frenchare likely to- occupy that region, and thus be in a positionto&apos; dominate the Euphrates valley from the  westward,.ie., attack  our interests in Persia from a direction andalong lines which our navy would be unable to  command.Thus, with France established  in the  south of Syria,the reason for holding  its most  northern  corner  isaccentuated ; for  Alexandretta is  so  situated&apos; as  to be    [426J
able  to  command  the  lines of communication  to  theEuphrates valley from the south and from the west, aswell as the lines from Asia Minor to Syria, Egypt, andArabia ;  the junction of these three main routes  on  theBagdad.Railway lies but a short distance from the town,which is already connected to the main line by a branchrailway.    There are, therefore, strong military reasons  for  ouroccupying Alexandretta and its hinterland, in order toprotect our interests in Persia from an  attack by landdown the&apos; Euphrates valley.    The question is also worth serious consideration froma commercial point of view.    When the Bagdad Railway is completed, the trade ofMesopotamia will increase ;  improved irrigation in  theEuphrates valley  is sure to follow,  and the  countryunder good and settled  government  may be expected todevelop  similarly  to Egypt  since  our influence wasexercised over that country.            . - -    A Mediterranean port on a railhead  of the BagdadRailway  will be a necessity, and the nearest and mostsuitable  and   convenient one  will  be  Alexandretta.Failing this, the trade must go further by rail either toBeirout or to a western port in Asia  Minor.    Beirout  at  first may be a serious competitor, beingwell  established   on   a commercial  basis,  but  itsresources are limited and not readily  extended ;  whereasAlexandretta,  at  comparatively small expense,  can bedeveloped into a commercial port unlimited in area.    A British occupation of the territory,  with low tariffsand freedom from  corruption, would alone give a greatimpetus  to trade in the Euphrates valley, and this,coupled with the development of the oilfields in Persia,improved irrigation in the river valleys, and working ofminerals in Asia &quot;Minor, would soon necessitate wellfound ports, equally at  the Mediterranean  and PersianGulf ends of the railway. .   Competition for freights would  in  time  turn theattention of expert engineers to the use of the river to agreater extent even than it is used at present.  Improve--ments in channels, piers, and a thriving  local as well asinternational trade  may be expected.    Whether the construction of a barge canal betweenthe Euphrates and Mediterranean is  a  physical possi-bility is a question for the civil engineers.  At presentit  does  not look  a promising commercial  one,  butimprovements in the landing facilities at Jerablus, or atMeskene, and the extension of the railwav to this rivertown,  would   enable   good  motor   barges  to  carrysuitable  tanks containing oil  or  other merchandiseto  Meskene and transfer  them direct  to railway truckswithout unloading or  unpacking the contents  until theterminal  port of Alexandretta was reached.    From the naval point of  view, it is most undesirablethat any other powerful  nation should  develop Alex-andretta  on the above lines, as it would be  a possessionit  would hold  at all costs, and give its holder  a validexcuse for converting  it  also into a naval base, fromwhich its fleet would threaten our  lines of comrnunica-tion through the Canal and Dardanelles, and it wonldprobably necessitate the construction of  a fortified waranchorage  on  our  part  in   Cyprus, from which  noadequate return would be gathered commensurate withits great  expense.  -   -
    There is little doubt this was Germany&apos;s intention,and her  proposed  action  is  comparable  with that atDuala in the Cameroons, which was fast developing intoa naval base when war broke out.    They  are  somewhat similar as  far  as  strategicalposition is concerned each being on the flanks of trade.routes in  a  cul de sac,  unattackable  from the rear, andthey are not ports of call  near  trade routes, and thusdiffer from most of our naval bases.    They therefore excite less attention, though equallydangerous to  our  interests, and  consequently suchpositions should be prevented from falling into the handsof our future possible enemies ;  this is best  effected byholding them ourselves.
