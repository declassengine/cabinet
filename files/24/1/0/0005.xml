February 1915.SECRET.G-5.COMMITTEE OF  IMPEEIAL  DEFENCE.THE  WAS.The  Dardanelles,Letter from Mr. Julian Corbett to Colonel Hankey;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,           February 5, 1915.
THE  DARDANELLES.DearHankey,                                       in         February 4, 1915.-    THIS is in reply to your request for a note on our old attempts on the Dardanelles.    The leading case,  of course, is Duckworth&apos;s in 1807--not pleasant  reading, sinceit is the most conspicuous of the many failures of. the &quot; All the Talents &quot;administrationin war direction.            m                                 m          ...... -    The object was  to assist  our ally  Russia, who was bearing the brunt of thestruggle against Napoleon, and against  whom Turkey was being  induced by French.ao-ents to declare war.   To this end Duckworth was given a  division of seven of theline from  the  Mediterranean Fleet with instructions that, if Turkey  did not desistfrom hostilities with Russia, he was to demand the  surrender of her fleet, and if theydid not agree to this in an hour he was  to take up a position which would enable himto destroy Constantinople and the fleet in  the Golden Horn.:    As a  further means of assisting  Russia our  Government had promised, shouldTurkey declare war, to occupy Alexandria with  a division from our garrison in Sicily.    Sir John Moore had just been sent  out as second-in-command  to General Fox atMessina and  he at  once put his finger on the weak point of the design.  So stronglydid he feel about  separating  the  troops  from  the fleet and locking  them up inAlexandria, that General Fox sent him to meet Duckworth at Malta to get his consentto the troops  being held  back for the present.  &quot; My opinion is,&quot; Moore wrote in hisDiary, &quot; that the expedition to Alexandria is  a mistake......  It would have beenwell  at present to have sent  7,000  or 8,000 men with the  fleet to Constantinople,which would have secured their passage through the Dardanelles and  enabled theAdmiral to destroy the Turkish fleet and arsenal.&quot;    He could do no more than obtain a respite till Duckworth had actually ascertainedthe state of affairs at Constantinople.   On reaching the Dardanelles the  Admiral foundTurkey had declared war  on Russia, and he had to send back word that our under-taking  in regard to Alexandria must  be made good.   So the troops had to go thereinstead of to Constantinople.    The result was just what Moore anticipated.  With  a fair wind Duckworth wasable to run the gauntlet of the batteries, destroying a cruiser squadron on his way, butas he carried  on for Constantinople  the  wind  fell, leaving  him helpless eight milesaway from the city.                                                      -   &apos;    In these circumstances, General  Sebastiani, Napoleon&apos;s agent, had  little difficulty&apos;in persuading the Turks to turn a deaf ear to Duckworth&apos;s overtures and menaces andto strengthen  their  fortifications for resistance. This they did not only at Constan-&apos;tinople, but also at the Dardenelles, till Duckworth, after waiting a week for a.wind,was  forced to retire before his retreat was entirely cut  off.   As  it was, he  was onlyjust in time ; in repassing the new batteries his fleet suffered severely.     The result Was a  very  severe  blow to our prestige  in  the Near East, and, whatwas  worse, our relations  with  Russia were poisoned.   So far  from  the  operationstrengthening the alliance, as was intended, the Czar began  to give us  up in despair,and a few months later signed the Peace of  Tilsit with Napoleon.     The new  British Government ordered Colingwood in person  to the spot to repairthe mischief, and before the signing  of the peace of Tilsit was  known he attacked theDardanelles in concert with a Russian  squadron under  Admiral  Seniavin,  but beingstill without troops  they Avere again defeated.     The best that can be said of the whole episode  is that we learnt the lesson and did not again fall into the  error which  M&apos;oore had so  clearly seen.  Owing to the secret articles signed  at Tilsit it became  necessary  to forestall Napoleon by treating Copenhagen as we had hoped to treat Constantinople.  But  in this case an adequate army accompanied the  fleet,  and the  result was  a brilliant success that entirely defeated and outwitted Napoleon.  ;  If this does not throw sufficient  light on the points you may have in mind I can give  you further detail.                                              Yours sincerelv,                                                       JULIAN  S.  CORBETT.       PltlXTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON.-10/2/1915.
