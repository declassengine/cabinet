October 1915.SECRET.G-26.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Precis of Documents and  Proceedings  connected with  the    Political  and  Military  Developments  in  the  Balkan    Peninsula  from September 1 to 28, inclusive, 1915.Prepared by the Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,              October 1915.
(NOTE BY THE SECRETARY. This is the first instalment of a Precis      it is intended to keep up during the acute phase of the Balkan      crisis.)PRECIS  OF  DOCUMENTS  AND  PROCEEDINGS  CON-     NECTED  WITH  THE POLITICAL AND  MILITARY     DEVELOPMENTS  IN THE  BALKAN   PENINSULA     SINCE SEPTEMBER  1,  1915.                          SEPTEMBER 1.      THE present phase of the Balkan problem may he said to have been entered on both in a military and political sense on or about the  1st September. 1915.  On that  date the French Government gave its first formal and  official  recognition of its  interest in the Near East as a field for extended military activity  by  asking  the Admiralty to assist them in providing transport for an expedition of four  divisions to the Near  East,  to be combined  -with the two divisions at present holding part of the Allied line at Cape Helles in order to make a new attack on the Dardanelles.      2. On the same date the  Serbian Government, to  whom the No. 343, received proposed declaration of the Powers regarding concessions to Bulgaria SeP*&quot;1 from had  been communicated on the 4th August,  replied, accepting the proposals of the Powers, subject to some  rather  material  and important reservations,                         SEPTEMBER  11.      3. On the 11th  September Lord Kitchener, accompanied  by Lieutenant-Colonel Hankey, was present at a conference at Calais, which was attended by M. Millerande, General  Joffre, General Sarail, designated tocommand the French array in the Near East, and Sir John - French. It was agreed that no decision would be taken regarding the despatch of the proposed&apos;expedition to the Near East until after the forthcoming  great offensive in the West.  Subject to  these reserva- tions transport for six divisions (four Erench and two British to relieve the twro French divisions  now at Cape  Heiles) was to be prepared, and it was to be assumed for purposes of  calculation that the earliest date at which the expedition could commence embarka- tion at Marseilles was the 10th October.  General Joffre expressed the hope that he would be able to decide whether the four divisions could be spared within three days of the commencement of the infantry attack (viz., by the 30th September); but both he and Sir John French insisted thai: they could not guarantee to have the required troops extricated  from the line  of  battle  and  ready to embark by the 10th October.  General Joffre made  no secret of his dislike to the proposed enterprise in the East.     4.  At this point it is opportune  to mention that orders  were given by the Admiralty shortly alter this conference for the assembly of  the necessary transport at  Marseilles on the 10th October, but owing to the  subsequent changes in the  political situation to be referred to in these notes the  orders were  cancelled.  There is, however, at present a large quantity  of naval transport available both in the Mediterranean and in home waters.                        SEPTEMBER 14.    5.  The negotiations between the  Governments of the Powers Sofia, No. 573,forming the Quadruple Alliance regarding the presentation  of the Sept. 14. Note  to Bulgaria in view  of the Serbian attitude, and its  actual    [1099]                                               B
               drafting, occupied nearly a fortnight, and it was the 14th September               before the Note was  actually  presented.  Finally, it was  decided &apos;               that the Serbian objection must be overruled, and the text of  the               Note was as follows : Sofia, No. 574,        &quot;Pour faire suite a leurs communications du 16  (29) mai et du 20 etSept. 14.         ler juillet (3 aout dernier), les  representants des Puissances  alliees sont&apos;               charges de faire au Gouverneinent Royal la declaration suivante :                    Les quatre  Puissances  sout pretes a garantir a la Bulgarie la cession               par la Serbie, aussitot la guerre terminee, de la partie  de la Macedoine qui               etait comprise, par le traite Bulgarie-Serbie de 1&apos;annee 1912, dans la zone  dito               non contestee.                   &quot; Cette garantie est toutefois subordonnee  a la declaration de la part de               la Bulgarie quelle est  prete  a conclure avec les Puissances alliees un               arrangement militaire touchant son entree en action contre la Turquie a une               date rapprochee.  Si aucune declaration de ce genre n&quot;est recue  dans un               court delai, 1&apos;offre contenue dans la presente note sera consideree comme non               avenue par consentement mutuel.&quot;                    (Sent to Petrograd, Athens, and Sir G. Barclay.)                    6. In  presenting  the Note  the  representatives  of the four               Powers at Sofia stated verbally that they expected  a reply within a               few  days, and the Bulgarian Minister promised to send one.                                        SEPTEMBER 17.                    7. Information regarding  the above offer  to  Bulgaria was               allowed to leak out  to  the  strong political elements in Bulgaria               favourable to our cause, who at  once began to exert  themselves.Sofia, No. 584,    On  the  17th  September the  leaders  of  the Bulgarian oppositionSept. 18.         were received by King Ferdinand and warned him of  the  dangers               of the policy to which he was committing Bulgaria, demanding at               the  same time  the formation of a Coalition Ministry and an early               convocation of  the Sobranye.  Our proposals, however, were  not               considered by our friends in  Bulgaria to be sufficiently far-reaching               to produce any immediate popular enthusiasm in favour of active               co-operation with the Allies.  The chief criticism made was that we               propose to occupy those portions of the uncontested zone which Serbia               is known to be willing to  cede (namely, the portion  to the east of               the Vardar), but not those portions which the  Bulgarians believe that               Serbia, backed by Greece, will never cede of her own free will.  Our               offer would have been more attractive if it had held out hopes of             &quot;* immediate or early occupation of some portion of the promised lands               by the Bulgarians themselves.                                        SEPTEMBER 20.Sofia, No. 601,         8.  On the 20th September the  sinister news was received that-Sept. 20.         a Bulgarian mobilisation was  imminent, and  that Bulgaria  was               believed to have committed  herself definitelv to the side of  the               Central Powers.  Up  to this time  there was no positive indication               of an Austro-German offensive from the north.                                        SEPTEMBER 21.Sofia, No. 610,         9.  On the  21st September Mr.  0&apos;Beirne  reported that  theSept. 22.         expected Bulgarian mobilisation had not yet taken place, and that               there was a marked lack of enthusiasm among the troops.                    10.  On the same  day the Bulgarian Prime Minister addressed a               meeting of his followers (reported  by Mr. 0&apos;Beirne on  the  evening               of the 21st and  received in London on the  morning  of  the 22nd),               which represented that the  cause of  the   Allies  was  lost;  that               Bulgaria  must, not attach herself to  the   losing side;  that  the               Quadruple  Alliance had only  made vague proposals  to  Bulgaria
with regard to the occupation of the uncontested zone after the war ;and that if Bulgaria went to war she was assured  oi the neutralityof Rournania.                           SEPTEMBER  22.     II. On the  22nd September  Mr.  0&apos;Bcirn.e  was  directed  to  Foreign Office,represent to the Bulgarian Prime Minister  the concern felt at the  No. 468, to Sofia,reports  that Bulgaria might take  active  sides  with  the  Central  Se^-22-Powers,, but without making any threats.     12. On, the same  day Sir G. Barclay was  instructed to  sound  Foreign Office,M. Bratiano  as  to  the feasibility  of a  defensive  understanding  No. 548, to         m              i  -     i n                                     Bucharest,between lioumania, oerbia,  and Greece.                               g ^ 22i     13: On the  22nd also  the  Prime Minister of Serbia informed  ^ish, No. 395,the representatives of  the four  Towers of  increasing movements of  Sept. 22.Austro-German troops  both  in Syrmia and  Banat, as  well as  ofthe despatch of Bulgarian troops and munitions to Widin, and askedfor the despatch  of 150,000  Allied troops to assist Serbia, repre-senting that this would probably decide  Greece, and that  Bulgariawould also  probably yield.     1-4. The Tureo-Bulgariau agreement  re the  surrender of the  Athens, No. 892,Dedeagatch Railway is said to have been signed at midnight on the  Sept. 26.22nd September.SEPTEMBER %-     15. On the 23rd September a meeting of the Dardanelles Com-  Minutesof XXXEstmittee  was held, at which Sir  Edward Grey stated that the Greek  Meeting, Sept. 23.as well as the Serbian Prime Minister had appealed for the support  Athens, No. 854,of 150,000 Allied troops.*  He pointed out  that the  despatch of a  Sept- 2Lforce, if feasible, might  decide both the  Greeks and Roumanians,and that, if both these countries would mobilise now,  it might savethe situation.  If he had to remain silent on this Question, even forforty-eight hours, the situation might become  irreparable.   Therewas a  long discussion,  the question being  extraordinarily  difficultto answer in the conditions then  obtaining.   The Committee knew    * The text of the Athens telegram asking for these troops is as follows :         &quot; M. Venizelos sent for French and Russian Ministers and me this evening,    and  said he had received from Sofia news that a decree had been signed, but not:    &quot;    published, for mobilisation of four  divisions, which in Bulgaria is equivalent to    150,000 men, and that cavalry had been sent as a screen to Serbian frontier.        &quot; The Decree may possibly be  intended to sound the intentions of  Roumania    and  Greece, as well as of the Powers, but M. Venizelos considers the  situation    very serious, and has conferred with the King and Chief of the General Staff.    Both of, them consider that as Serbia  is not in a position to furnish against    Bulgaria contingent of 150,000 stipulated in the Treaty of Alliance, Greece is    freed from her  engagements.  On the other hand, King,  Chief of  Staff,  and    M. Venizelos himself agree that Greece alone cannot provide more than 150,000    bayonets, aud cannot face struggle without support from elsewhere.        &quot;In the circumstances M. Venizelos asks  to  be  informed without delay    whether the  150,000 men whom Serbia cannot provide can be  furnished    immediately by England and France, European, and not Colonial, troops being    sent.  In case  Houmania  joined, this force would not be necessary.   But he    wishes to know at once  whether, in  default of  Roumania,  whom he cannot    consult directly, he can count upon allied contingents.  He thinks Greece ought    to reply to Bulgarian mobilisation by an equivalent mobilisation, for  which    assistance of Allies or of Roumania is a sine qua non condition.        &quot; To save time, he hopes that replies from Paris and London will be sent    separately and without consultation to Athens, in order that within twenty-four    hours he may have something to  go upon in his proposals to the King.   If    replies agree in principle, he will propose to the King  that  Greece- should    mobilise as soon as Bulgaria has done so.        &quot; My colleagues and I  are convinced that if the King refuses, M. Venizelos    will resign, but  he has every hope that, if  he  receives  promises  which he    suggests, His Majesty will  agree.        &quot; Similar telegrams are being sent by my colleagues.   Sent to Petrograd,    Paris, Nish, Sofia, and Bucharest.&quot;
ttait the  French  offensive was  about to  commence, though theprecise date (the 26th) was unknown to the majority of the members ;until  tliis offensive was over, it was impossible to say whether thetroops could be spared from the West or not.  It was possible thatsome  might  be spared  from  the  Dardanelles, but it was  believedthat this could be  dOne only by the abandonment of Suvla Bay, andin view  of the near approach of  winter,  and the value  hithertoattached to tins bay as a landing place for the supply  of Anzac, itwas doubtful whether troops could  be spared from this source.Foreign Office toAtheDS, No. 776,Sept. 23.Bucharest,No. 597, Sept. 23War Office,No. 8162, cipher,Sept. 23. 3-20 P.M.Petrograd,No. 1387, Sept. 22.    16i Eventually, however, a decision was reached which resultedin the  despatch on  the livening  of  the 23rd  September  of  thefollowing telegram to Athens : -    &quot;Military advisers are considering the situation.   We should  like toknow what number of troops would be required at Salonica to indxice Greeceto give her full Support to Serbia if Bulgaria attacks Serbia.    &quot; It would take a considerable time before 150,000 men could be landedat Salonica;, but we could of course send a comparatively small contingentto Salonica in a short time  to impress  Bulgaria with evidence of ourintention to support Greece and Serbia.    &quot;You  should inform  M.  Venizelos,  and ask. whether, pending thediscussion of anything larger,  he would  welcome  the despatch of a smallBritish force and its landing at  Salonica.&quot;    [This is important as being  the  first definite  mention  of  anyproposal on our side to land troops at Salonica.]    17. The Dardanelles Committee had proposed that BYicharestshould be informed of this telegram, but no action was taken by theForeign Office owinii; to the receipt that afternoon of a  telegramfrom Sir G. Barclay that the Roumanian Prime Minister &quot; could&quot;not  adopt  our suggestion&quot; as regards a defensive alliance withGreece and Serbia in the event of Bulgaria^ rejecting our proposals.Roumania,  he said, had alwavs intended  to enter the war bv anattack on  Austria-Hunjyarv and not  on Bulgaria.  He  was  alsosceptical regarding any Greek move against Bulgaria.    18. Another  result of  this meeting  was  that Lord Kitchenersent a  telegram to  Sir Ian Hamilton consulting him  as  to  thepossibility of an abandonment of Suvla  Bay. . A similar telegramwas sent  by Mr. Balfour to Yiee-Admiral  de R,obeck, an additionbeing made to the effect that there was no idea of withdrawing  ourmilitary forces from  the Gallipoli Peninsula.    19. On  the 23rd September also the  suggestion, which laterexercised  an important influence on our diplomacy, was receivedfrom  Petrograd  that  Serbia was likely  to forestall  a Bulgarianoffensive.Petrograd,No. 1388,:Sept. 23.-Sofia, No. 612,Sept. 22.     20. The same telegram  contained  the original  proposal of theRussian Foreign Minister to  demand an answer from Bulgaria and,in the  event of an unsatisfactory  or  evasive reply,  to break  offrelations.   He also urged that the four Powers should lose no timein making it clear that a Bulgarian attack on Serbia would  entailirreparable  rupture of relations with the Allied  Powers.  He saidit was  ridiculous of the Greeks to expect that Great Britain and.France  could send 150,000 men  at  the present  moment, but.advocated the despatch  of a small force of 5,000 men.     21. On  the same  date  news was received from  Sofia thatM. Ghenadieff considered that  the only possibility of checking theBulgarian Government  was to land troops at Salonica, a  step whichhe thought would make au  enormous  impression in  the country,rendering  U  impossible  for  the  King  and  his Government  topersevere in their policy.

                         SEPTEMBER 24.     22.  On  the 24th September the  Dardanelles Committee metagain.  Since the meeting on the previous day, in addition to thedespatch  of   the telegrams and the  receipt  of  the  tendentiousinformation mentioned above, the following important  intelligencehad been received : -     (a.)  Definite news that Bulgaria had issued orders on the night Sofia, No. 616,of the 22nd September for a general  mobilisation to take effect from MllltaiT&apos; Sept-23.the 2oth  September, midnight.   Dp  to this  time  there  had  beenlittle  doubt  that mobilisation  was  intended,  but  nothing  wasdefinitely known.     (6.) The  French Government had come  to the conclusion that Paris, No. 685,M.  Venizelos&apos; application  for   military  support  should not  be Sept. 23.rejected, as a  refusal would mean his  resignation.  He should beassured that if Greece will mobilise in support of Serbia, French andBritish troops would be  sent  to  support Greece  and  Serbia inresisting  an   invasion  by Bulgaria.  This course, the ErenchGovernment considered, might frighten the King  of Bulgaria andhis  Government, and would deprive the  King of  Greece of  anexcuse for not mobilising.     (c.)  Definite news that in reply to  the Bulgarian mobilisation Athens, No. 867,the  King of  Greece had consented to a general  mobilisation of the Sept. 23.Greek army  lias a  measure of  precaution not  committing thecountry to participation in the general war.&quot;     23.  lloumania and Greece had both denied having given any Bucharest,promise  to Bulgaria  (as alleged by King Ferdinand) to remain No. 599, Sept. 23..neutral.                                                          Athens, No. 863,                                                                 Sept 23.     24.  In  view  of  the  above  changes  in  the  situation, the Minutes ofDardanelles  Committee  unanimously  agreed  that  the  Greek ^XXIInd Meet-Government should be informed that we were prepared  to associate ms&apos;ourselves with the reply of the French Government guaranteeingThe forces asked for to enable Greece  to fulfil  her pledges to Serbia,and a telegram in this sense was despatched.     25. The text of the actual telegram to Athens was as fellows :  Foreign Office to    &quot;The following instruction has been  sent,  to  French  Minister at ^p^gi^0&apos;Athens :      &apos; Vous pouvez dire a M. Venizelos que le Gouvernement, voulant mettrela Grece en mesure cle remplir dans les circonstances prevuespaiie Presidentdu Conseil les obligations de son traite avec la Serbie, est pret, pour sa part,a fournir les troupes qui vous ont ete demandees.&apos;    &quot;French -Minister for Foreign Affairs asks that  you should make thesame declaration to M. Veuizelos, and you are authorised to  do so.  You,should, at the same time, say to M. Venizelos that  we are ready to beginmaking arrangements at once to send the  first large contingent on hearingdefinitely that their despatch to Salonica  will be Avelcomed by the GreekGovernment.&quot;     26. There was also some discussion at the Committee as to how War Office tele-the British share (75,(K;0) of the  150,000 men promised to France gram, No. 8229,was  to be found.  Lord Kitchener outlined a plan which involved l-^fp Sept25&apos;-the  abandonment of Suvla Bay  and the  release of two  divisions     &apos;M&quot;thereby, which, together  with some  Yeomanry on their  way out,Avould give a total of 37,400.   The total force; would subsequentlybe completed by detaching troops from  France.   Eventually it wasdecided to inform Sir Ian  Hamilton as to the course of events inthe Balkans, and to consult him  as to what force could be sparedfrom the Gallipoli Peninsula.     27. In the course of this meeting Lord Kitchener read  anappreciation by the  General Staff,  in which occurs the followingstatement: 
Blegrade, No. 399,Sept. 24.Foreign Office toRoumania,No. 555,Sept. 24.  &apos;Bucharest,No. 600, Sept. 24.Foreign Office toBucharest,No. 557, Sept. 24.Bucharest,No. 602, Sept. 24.Athens, No. 868,Sept. 24.Sofia, No. 618,Sept. 23.Sofia, No. 619,Sept. 24.     &quot;It must be clearly understood that the role of the 150,000 Allied troops for which Greece has asked, and which will, if necessary, be sent to Salonica, will in the first instance be restricted to enabling and assisting the Greek army to  protect the  Serbian  flank and the line of communication with Salonica.&quot;     2S.  The opinion was also expressed that:    .     &quot; To enable Serbia to resist a strong attack from the north, as well as to defend the line of communication with Salonica, she should be supported by 300,000 men of the Allied armies in addition to the Greek army.&quot;     [This is interesting as a rough estimate of  the possible comm.it- ment of  an adventure in the Balkans.]     29.  On  the 24th September the  Russian Minister  at  Belgrade saw the Prime  Minister  of Serbia  and,  by instructions  from the Russian Government, insisted that Serbia should place the uncon-- tested zone in Macedonia at the disposal of  the Quadruple Alliance without  conditions.   In refusing to  do  this,  the Serbian Prime Minister  said  that  Serbia could  not  await  the  conclusion  of Bulgarian military preparations; that they could  not wait  long before beginning military operations against Bulgaria, being con- vinced that  rapidity was the main factor for possible success.   He also expressed the hope that  the Powers would declare the Bulgarian military preparations as an act hostile to them,  as such a declaration would have a great effect on public opinion in  Bulgaria, and render relations between Greece and Serbia easier,  as  the King of  Greece appeared to  hope that, if Serbia opened hostilities against Bulgaria, Greece would be freed from  her obligations  as an ally.     30.  On  the same day Roumania was urged to take  some action if  an Austro-German attack  should coincide  with  a Bulgarian attack on  Serbia.  Action against Austria, as contemplated by the Roumanian  Prime Minister, would be equally effective  as attack  on Bulgaria.  In a telegram which  crossed this,  however, Roumania was shown  to be strongly  opposed  to&apos; mobilisation,  owing to  her comparatively isolated situation.  Nevertheless, another  telegram was sent to urge on M. Bratiano  the importance of not remaining passive  at the moment  of  crisis.  It is  interesting to note  that M. Bratiano  urged  that  a  demonstration should  be  made  at Hedeagatch  and Bourgas&apos; which, he  said, would  have a good effect on Bulgarian opinion.     31.  In  the  evening of the  24th September a  telegram was received from Athens  to the effect  that M. Venizelos understood that the British and  Prench telegrams meant that the whole force of 150,000 men would be sent, &quot; and he would  be pleased at arrival &quot; at Salonica of any force of Allied troops, however small.&quot;  It then went  on to  explain M. Venizelos&apos; doubts about the  King of the Hellenes,  who, after  giving his  consent,  had subsequently tried, though  too  late, to stop  M. Venizelos from asking for  the 150,000 men from the Allies.     32.  At this time (23rd September) the British Minister at Sofia was still of  opinion that, the most  hopeful method  of saving the. situation was for Serbia  to hand over the uncontested   zone  to Bulgaria,  and expressed considerable doubt  as to  whether  the landing  of  Allied  troops in Salonica would  stay  Bulgaria.   He also urged that we should make it perfectly clear  that &quot;  if the Allied &quot;forces  enter the uncontested zone they  do  so with  the view  of &quot; eventually  handing it over to  Bulgaria,  unless the latter  takes &quot; some steps making a rupture with the Allies unavoidable.&quot;  In this telegram  Mr.  0&apos;Beinie  mentioned that  German  officers  were beginning to arrive.     [This is  the  first mention of the reported  arrival of German officers,  which afterwards became a vitally important factor in  the situation.]
                         SEPTEMBER 25/    33. On the 2&apos;otb September the British Minister at Athens was Foreign Office to!!instructed  to ascertain  whether, the Greek  Government officially g^11^     &apos;accepted our offer to send troops to Salonica, and  would welcomethem  on arrival, as the military authorities were diverting troopshipsthither.  The  telegram  concluded: &quot; 1 do not gather from your&quot;telegram that there: Will: be hesitation&apos;  oh part of $reeft Govern-&quot; menr, but should be glad of an immediate reply from  you  to&quot; make sure that there is no misunderstanding, as time is of great&quot; importance.&quot;    34. On the same evening a telegram was received from Athens Athens^No. 877,(though not a reply to the above) to the effect that the King and Sept 25.M. Venizelos were now in agreement, and  adding  that &quot;the King&quot; hoped that the Allied troops would  not be  sent to  Salonica for&quot; the present,  but  M. Venizelos trusts that preparations to send&quot; them will be rapidly pushed on, and  that they  will be  sent  to&quot; Mudros  or other convenient [group unclecypherable], so as to  be&quot; available  when wanted, which  he thinks  the  course  of  events&quot; will soon  prove to  be  the  case.&quot;   In this telegram  Sir FrancisElliot warned  us  that it might be  necessary  in order to save theKing&apos;s face for the Greeks to register a formal  protest.  At thistime  iVl. Venizelos still suspected the  King of being pledged to the Athen^No. 876,German Emperor in some way:                                   Sept. 25.    35. In a  later telegram  Sir  Francis  Elliot reported  that Athens, No. 886,M. Venizelos thought it  better that the Allied troops should  not  go Sept. 25.direct to Salonica but to Mudros and Mifcylene.   &quot; There  would  beno  objection,  however,  to stores,  munitions  of  war,  horses,  &amp;c,being landed at Salonica and  taken up country  by men in plainclothes, under pretence of being destined for Serbia,.&quot;     36. On this  day (2oth September) Bulgaria was publishing Sofia, No. 620,widely that her mobilisation was not conceived in an offensive spirit. Sept. 25.The liable Minister stated definitely  to  Mr.  0&apos;Beirne that &quot;mobi-&quot; lisation is not intended to support tlie enemies of Great Britain,&quot; hut only to give greater force to B&apos;uigafia&apos;s claims and rights, and&quot; that is why  we have proclaimed our armed neutrality.&quot;  He alsodenied that mobilisation signified an  intention  to attack Serbia,but admitted that &quot;perhaps  she would occupy Macedonia, though&quot; not at once,&quot; and Mr. 0&apos;Beirne left with the impression that thesituation was most  serious.     37. At this time (25th September) Russia still adhered  to the Petrograd,view that it was Serbia&apos;s interest to consent to the  eventual cession No-1407&apos; Sept. 25.of the uncontested zone.      38. On this  date Sir  Ian  Hamilton reported that General Sir Ian Hamilton Bailloud had received a telegram from the French Minister of  War (No- M:F- 670)) ordering him  to make arrangements for sending away  a division  of fcept 2o* the  Corps expeditionnaire  oriental.   The Erench military  autho- J^^6&apos;. r. rities, however, were told that their action was premature.&apos;         Sept. 28.&apos;^P ^                          SEPTEMBER 26.      39. Oh the 26th September the Greek and Bulgarian Govern- Athens, No. 893, ments agreed that their respective frontier guards should be with- Se^- 2G- drawn beyond rifle range.      40,  On the 26th September also the British Minister at Nish, Nish, No. 406, on  being, informed  by  the  Serbian Prime  Minister that Serbian Sept. 26. troops were.being sent where  Bulgarian attack might  be expected, &quot; urged importance ofutmost -prudence, so  that Serbia should not be &quot; held by  her friends and the world in general to have put herself in
               lithe wrong by precipitating an attack.&quot; Sir C. des Graz&apos;s impression,               which he believed his colleagues to share, was that unless the action               decided on by  the  Quadruple Alliance  resulted in  checking and               frightening Bulgaria before  her  military  preparations were com-               pleted, the Serbians still considered their one chance  of success               would lie in forestalling a Bulgarian attack.Bucharest,            41. Six divisions of Austro-German troops were  now  reportedNo. 609, Sept. 2o,  0n the Serbian frontier, but Bucharest reported between  300,000               and 500,000  in Banat under  command  of Mackensen with head-               quarters at Temesvar.Petrograd,42. On the same dav the Russian Minister for  Foreign AffairsNo. 1413, Sept. 26.  gp^g strongly to the  Serbian Minister  against  any  attack  onSir Ian Hamilton,No. M.F. 675,Sept. 26.Bulgaria.    43. On the 26th  September  Sir Ian Hamilton sent a  strongprotest  against  abandoning  Suvla  Bay,  but  explained how, bydepriving tired troops of their rest, he could release two divisions toproceed  to Salonica.   The  Vice-Admiral  also  objected  to  theabandonment of Suvla Bav.    44. The 26th September saw the commencement of the greatoffensive of the Allies in the West.Athens, No. 900,Sept. 27.                         SEPTEMBER 27.    45. On the 27th  September  the Military Attache in Athensreported the  completion of  mobilisation  on the  previous  uay,15 divisions, aggregating 350,000 men, being now complete. On the30th September the concentration of the whole force in  Macedoniawas to be commenced.Foreign Office toSofia, No. 480.Sept. 27.Bucharest,No. 616, Sept. 26.Foreign Office toAthens, No. 791,-Sept. 27.     46. On the same date the Bulgarian Minister made a formalcommunication to  Sir  Edward Grey  explaining  their attitude  ofarmed neutrality, and stating definitely that &quot; they have no aggres-&quot; sive intentions whatever against Bulgaria&apos;s neighbours.&quot;  In takingact of this, Sir Edward Grey expressed satisfaction with the sentencequoted above, the more so because, &quot; if Bulgaria joined our enemies^&quot; we should have to give all the support we  could to our  friends,&quot; and there would be, to our  great  regret, a complete breach with&quot; Bulgaria.&quot;   The British Minigter at Sofia was authorised to makean identic communication on these  lines if his colleagues desired it.     47. On the same date the British Minister, in reply to ForeignOffice telegrams Nos. 555 and 557 (paragraph  30 above), forwardeda further refusal by M. Bratiano to  mobilise, giving full reasons.     48. On the 27th  September also an important  telegram  wassent to the British Minister at Athens, in which he was directed topoint out to M. Venizelos that Serbia, unless  assured of  early andeffective assistance,  intended to deal a blow at Bulgaria before thelatter was ready.   It was pointed  out, however, that this wouldmean that Serbia would appear as the aggressor, and give KingConstanfine,  if he  so desired,  the  opening to say that  the casusfoederis has  not  technically arisen.  It would  also   unite  theBulgarian nation as  nothing  else  could  do.   &quot; 11 is, therefore, of&quot; the utmost  importance,&quot; the telegram continued, &quot; to restrain the&quot; Serbian Government, if possible, and this can only be done by an&quot; immediate assurance of Greek and Allied support. ....     &quot; It will  make all the difference if we can show Allied uniforms&quot; on the Serbo-Bulgarian frontier before Bulgarian troops cross the&quot; line.  As regards  question of Greek neutrality, we do not ask for&quot; passage  of  our  troops  in order to attack Austro-German forces,     [1099]                                               D
*&apos; but for the same purpose as Greece herself ismobilising, namely,&quot;to prevent aggression and breach of neutrality by Bulgaria.   I&quot; would even be vrepared to say that, except with consent o f  Greek&quot; Government, or in case of a direct attack by Austro-German forces,u the troops we send through Salonica  shall be used  for no other&quot; purpose.....     &apos;* (Gonfidential-Fov  your  own information only.)  Occupation&quot; of uncontested zone by Allied troops is of vital importance,  what-&quot; ever happens.  It  is equally important as enabling  us  to  exert&quot; pressure on Serbia  or Bulgaria, as may be most desirable to secure&quot; the Balkan position, which can only be secured by preventing  Balkan war.&quot;     [The above telegram is very important &quot;as indicating definitelyour  intention  to  send  troops  up to  the Uncontested  zone ahintention which has latterly  been lost sight  of under  changedconditions.  It is probably the  only indication  in these telegramsof the proposed destination  of the British troops.  Although thelast  paragraph  of  the telegram  was not  to  be communicated toM.  Venizelos,  it seems possible  that  he  may  have  scented  theintention to occupy the uncontested zone,  and that this may haveoccasioned his rather unaccountable outburst against  Sir EdwardGrev&apos;s statement in the House &quot;of  Commons on the 29th September,1915.]     49.  In another  telegram to  Athens the British  -Minister was Foreign Office totold that the military position  was very inconvenient to us, as the Athens^No. *92,intended diversion of transports to Salonica had had to be suspended  ep &apos; &quot;until there was a clear understanding as to landing the troops, andit was most important that we  should have a decision from Greecewitiidut delay.  The  idea of smuggling troops  through Salonica inplain clothes could not be  entertained (see paragraph -15, above).     50.  This telegram was crossed  by the following important Athens, No. 906,telegram from Athens :-                                          Sept&quot; 27&apos;    &quot;M.  Venizelos  has obtained  the consent of  the King to despatchof French and English troops to Salonica,  and  begs that it may be doneat once  if possible,, before   Greek  troops  require  to  use railway.  TheKing is to know nothing officially until they are on the point of arriving,when a formal protest will be made.  M.  Venizelos asks  for twenty-fourhours&apos; notice of their arrival, and requests that matter may be kept secret.&quot;     51.  On the 27th September  Lord  Kitchener  ordered Sir  Ian War Office,Hamilton to  make preliminary arrangements  for the despatch of No. 8303, cipher,the Xtli  and LUIrd  Divisions, in case they were required.           Sept 27-                          SEPTEMBER 28.     52.  To the above  telegram, paragraph  50, the following reply Foreign Office towas despatched on the 28th September :                           Athens, No. 800,    &quot; We are prepared to send troops to Salonica as desired, and arrange-ments are being made with that object.   In view, however, of the obviousdifficulty  of landing  troops  on Greek territory, in face  even of a formalprotest, it would never do for  Greek Government to make a protest, and weearnestly hope that M. Venizelos will secure that it shall be made clear thattheir arrival is welcome to Greece.&quot;                            : am     The telegram also invited the co-operation of the  Greek navalauthorities  in   the  provision  of  anti-submarine defences,  andsuggested the sending of  naval and military  officers to prepare ascheme of disembarkation.     53.  To this the Greek Government sent the following reply :     &quot; Greek  Government  thank  His Majesty&apos;s Government and  FrenchGovernment cordially for their offer of troops, but think there is no  presentnecessity  for them to avail themselves of it in view of declaration of boththe Bulgarian and Serbian Governments.&quot;Sept. 28.
Athens, No. 911,Sept. 28.Sir Ian Hamilton,No. M.F. 682,Sept.  28.Petrograd,            56.  Before leaving the 28th  September it must be  notedNo. 1422, Sept. 27. ^na^ a telegram was received from  Petrograd to the  effect that the               Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs had come round to the view               that it would be unfair to deprive Serbia of the strategical advantage               of forestalling a Bulgarian attack, regarding the  probability  of               which there was  now strong  evidence.   The telegram  contained               the following draft of an ultimatum which  the  Russian  Minister               for Foreign Affairs washed the four Powers to send to Sofia :                    &quot; Allied Powers having the most serious reasons to suspect intentions               which have led  to the mobilisation of  Bulgarian army, and on the other               hand  attaching  greatest value to preserving  the friendly relations which               unite them to  Bulgaria, consider they must in  the name of  that friendship               request  Bulgarian Government  to  revoke mobilisation order or  declare               herself ready to co-operate with the same Powers against Turkey.                   &quot; If within a delay  of twenty-four hours  Bulgarian Government does               not agree to either of these two courses, the Allied Powers will break off               all relations (tout) with Bulgaria.&quot;Foreign Office toPetrograd,No. 2246, Sept. 28.    57. On receipt of this  the  Foreign Office  sent  the followingto Petrograd, Paris, and Rome :     &quot; An  ultimatum  to  Bulgaria demanding revocation  of  mobilisationwithin twenty-four hours  would produce immediate rupture with Bulgariaand precipitate an attack by Serbia on Bulgaria at  the end of that limitof time.    &quot; It seems impolitic to  do this while the  action of Greece is  stillindefinite and no troops can arrive at Salonica for some time.&quot;    58. On this date (28th  September) it was reported  from Sofiathat the Austro-German troops had only four and a-half divisionsof inferior troops on the Roumanian frontier and two divisions onthe Serbian.   The  British  Military Attache expressed  the viewthat neither side was  likely to  attack the other for a  fortnight,Serbia being too late   and the Bulgarian  Government anxious togain time.                          SEPTEMBER 29.    59. On the morning of  the  29th  September  a  long telegramdespatched from Sofia on the evening of the 27th September  wasreceived, in the course of  which  Mr. 0&apos;Beirne  mentioned  that hehad impressed on the King&apos;s  secretary that  &apos;&apos;if Bulgaria were withus the presence of our troops in Macedonia would be a help and notan obstacle  to  her acquiring zone.&quot;    [Did King Ferdinand perhaps  communicate this  to Athensand  Belgrade,  and  was this  the  cause  of the  subsequent  mis-understanding regarding the landing of the Allied troops ?](To be continued.)PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARBISON. S/10/1915.     54. Oil the 29th  September, however, a further telegram wasreceived from Athens to the effect that no notice need be taken ofthe above  official telegram, which  was sent only for l&apos;orm&apos;s sake,and that the real telegram, in wdiich M. Venizelos desired the Alliesto take action, was Sir Francis Elliotfs No. 906  (paragraph  50,above).                                         *     55. On the 28th September  Sir  Ian Hamilton  reported thathe  was making  the necessary preliminary  arrangements  for  thedespatch of the Xth and LUIrd Divisions,  and was telling GeneralBailloud to prepare a  French  brigade, this  being the  utmost  hecould spare.
