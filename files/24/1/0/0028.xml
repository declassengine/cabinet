Paper G.-26.]Athens, No. 976,Oct 5.  ReceivedOct. 6, 9 A.M.Athens, No. 976.Athens, No. 977,Oct. 6.                      OCTOBER 5 AND  6.    131  The extent to which the sudden resignation of M. Venizeloswould affect our measures  for preventing a junction between theCentral Powers and Turkey was  not immediately clear.    In a telegram  received early on the 6th October, Sir E. Elliotexplained how the crisis  had  come about.   After  the  vote  ofconfidence in the Chamber  on the 5th, the King had come downto Athens during  the afternoon and had informed  M. Venizelosthat he had gone too far in his speech.   The King said  that  hecould not support his policy to the end, and thereupon M. Venizelostendered  his resignation.   M. Venizelos had since told Sir E. Elliotand his colleagues that no compromise was possible.   He  thoughta Coalition Ministry of all the Opposition leaders would be formed,hut he would not support such a Ministry unless it declared it wouldstand by  Serbia in the event of a Bulgarian  attack.   Sir E. Elliotadded,  however, that M. Venizelos might perhaps tolerate  such aMinistry  rather than bring about a revolution or a General Election,which would necessarily mean demobilisation.    132.  The loan  which had been arranged with England, France,and Russia might also prove a controlling consideration, but in thesame telegram Sir F. Elliot added that M. Venizelos suspected thatthe King, being aw ire the pecuniary assistance of the Allies wouldbe withdrawn upon his resignation, had some assurance that moneywould be forthcoming from Germany.    133.  Still, in spite of what had occurred, M. Venizelos was ofopinion that the disembarkation of the Allied troops ought to  beproceeded with as  quickly as  possible.   Sir F.  Elliot and  hiscolleagues agreed in this view in order to make it clear that M.Venizelos&apos;s resignation would have no effect upon our intentions.    It was suggested that Russia could  usefully send  troops bythe Danube if she had them to spare, and the French Governmentcontinued to urge Petrograd to make some move of this kind.    134.  This  was the more necessary, for at the moment therewas every appearance that the Greeks were not likely to meet theirengagements with Serbia unless further  action was taken  by theAllies.    [1099-2]                                           B
o    Our military attache reported that he had seen a Serbian officer Athens, No. 978,of the General Staff since the resignation of M. Venizelos.  This ^j-M^,officer had had a conference with the Greek General Staff and  was v mu es0dissatisfied with  their attitude, which he characterised as  selfish.They  were  concentrating  defensively around  Salonica,  withouttaking any steps  to proceed north to  help the Serbians.  He con-sidered that the only hope for Serbia now lay  in the continuation ofour disembarkation at all costs.    He thought that one division would have to be allotted to thesection opposite Strumnitza to protect the railway, and at the sametime gave warning that there was a shortage  of railway stock.    135. (a.) Meanwhile, in accordance with the conclusion of Lord Kitchenersthe 36th meeting, a conference  had taken place at Calais on the Note, Oct. 5.5th October  between Mr.  Balfour, Lord. Kitchener, M. Millerand,and M. Augagneur.    (b.)  It proceeded on the  premiss that, whatever the situationin France, the  Western Powers must send  the promised 150,000men to Salonica.   To this General Jofire  had agreed, provided theBritish troops did not leave for a week.    (c.)  In addition to the French division and a cavalry regimentalready provided, a brigade of marines  would  go in  a few  days,bringing the French force to  30,000 men.  They would be followedby a second brigade, two divisions of cavalry and another divisionof infantry, making in all 61,000 men.  In addition to the Britishdivision and cavalry regiment already detailed, it was  proposed totake three divisions from Sir  J. French&apos;s force, which would give  atotal  of 67,000 men.  The 20,000  that were  required to completethe promised total of 150,000 were left for further consideration.    (d.)  The command  of   the  two   contingents   was to  beindependent.    (e.)  As to transport the French required us to carry their two  .cavalry divisions  as well as our own three divisions, and the Directorof  Transports  said  that  the necessary  shipping would require  amonth to provide.    (/.)  The plan of operations led to a difference of opinion.   TheFrench had already informed the Greeks  that they merely meantto pass through their territory, and they had already ordered GeneralBaillaud to proceed with his  division  to  Isish without having anyassurance of co-operation from the Greeks.  As  such a movementwould leave the whole  force  en Vair  with very insecure  com-munications we  announced  our intention  of not  moving  fromSalonica till we knew definitely the Greeks  were taking an activepart.     (g.)  The French had no plan for further operations, and it wastherefore decided to send at once two staff  officers (British andFrench)  to  discuss plans with  the   Greek  and  Serbian  GeneralStaffs, the plan to be submitted to the two Entente Governments.     (h.)  It was  further  agreed that no further  troops must bewithdrawn from  Gallipoli, as these operations were inseparable fromthose at  Salonica.                          36t/i Meeting.     136. The questions arising  out  of  the facts  which the 36th  Minutes, Oct. G.meeting   had to consider  were  of the  utmost difficulty  anddelicacy.     (a.)  The  objections  to   following  the   French   lead in thehazardous action to  which they had committed themselves withoutconsulting us, were not only military, but also political. Assumingthe new  Greek Cabinet did not pursue  the general  policy of itspredecessors we could scarcely proceed with our enterprise withoutbeing involved not only in a most hazardous  operation, but also ina question of another Belgium.   It  appeared necessary at once  to
Foreign Office toAthens, No. 852,Oct. 6.Despatched7-15 P.M.Foreign Office toParis, No. 2257,Oct. 6.Despatched7*15 P.M.Petrograd,No. 1465, Oct 5.Sofia, No. 657,Oct. 5.apply for a  declaration of the  new Governments policy,  with anexpression of our intention not to proceed against their wishes, hutthe difficulty was to find  a formula  by which this could be donewithout  affording  the  new Government an  opportunity for atonce requesting the withdrawal of our forces from Salonica.     (6.)  The accusation that we had  violated  Greek neutrality,which was being spread  by German agents, also called for imme-diate refutation ;  but it  was agreed we could  not at this  stagepublish M. Venizelos&apos;s invitation without his consent, as the Kingwould certainly deny his endorsement of it,  and M. Venizelos&apos;sposition would be irretrievably ruined.   Tomeetthis  point, thedraft of a communication to the press was  agreed to in the sensethat at no time  had the Allies taken&apos;any step which they believedwould be unwelcome to Greece.    (c.) Various suggestions were made and  discussed as to theform in which the necessary communication of our views shouldbe  made  to Paris and Athens, and it was  finally decided  to leaveSir E.  Grey to send  a telegram  based  on the  suggestions whichseemed most nearly to meet the difficulties.    (d.)  It was further decided, in accordance  with the conclusionsof the Calais Conference, to send out General Howell to  concertplans with the Erench, Greek, and Serbian  staffs, and that for thepresent no more troops were to be moved to Salonica.    137.  In pursuance  of these conclusions,  Sir E.  Grey  tele-graphed to Sir E. Elliot directing him to ask for an  audience  withthe King and to explain  that  British troops  had been sent  toSalonica  on  the understanding  that Greece intended to  supportSerbia against Bulgaria in accordance with what were believed  tobe  Treaty obligations,  and that the co-operation of British andFrench troops would  be welcome to, and was desired by, Greece  toenable her to discharge those obligations.    He was  to point out how urgent it  was that we should knowclearly what the views of Greece were in this respect, so that wemight  be able to decide the best method  of  utilising  the Alliedtroops to support Greece and Serbia against  Bulgaria, and to askthe King tq authorise M. Venizelos  or his  successor to inform  usfrankly and fully on these points.    In regard to the  French Government, Lord  Bertie was to saythat we could not send more troops to Salonica till the situation hadbeen  cleared up.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  were  decidedly  ofopinion that it would be  dangerous to send troops through Greekterritory into the Balkans without being assured of the co-operationof  Greece.   It  was  therefore  essential  to  have a  definite under-standing with Greece before incurring further liabilities and  risksin the Balkans.     Lord Bertie was  also asked to obtain the views of the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs.     138.  For the present no further offer was made to Greece, butat Petrograd Sir G. Buchanan had been assured  by the Minister ofForeign Affairs that he entirely concurred with the British proposalfor tempting her with Smyrna and its hinterland.     139. At the  same time Mr. 0&apos;Beirne  reported that Sofia was seriously disturbed at the prospect of a  breach with  Great Britain. The Government had begged him to represent their case, and had protested they were sure their natural protectress would reconsider her decision,  as all they had done was  to  safeguard their national existence.     They had, however, categorically refused the Russian demands, on the grounds there were no German or Austrian officers on the Staff, and that it was  impossible to &quot; break openly&quot; with the Central Powers.   A similar refusal had been given to  the French  Minister,
and  Mr. 0&apos;Beirne  considered  there was no  course open  to himexcept to deliver the communication associating  himself with hisFrench and Russian colleagues. Without, therefore, waiting for theItalian Minister, who had  no instructions, he asked to be receivedby the Prime Minister, and telegraphed home the  essential partof: the note which  he  was presenting to the Bulgarian Govern-ment:     &quot;Le Gouvernement Imperial ruese, par la note  du 4 octobre, a declareau Gouvernement Royal bulgare  qu&apos;en vue de la  presence d&apos;officiers alle-mands et autrichiens dans l&apos;arm6e  bulgare, la  concentration de troupes clansla zone limitrophe de la Serbie, et le  secours financier  pr6te a la Bulgariepar les Puissances centrales, il etait desormais hors de doute que le Gouverne-ment bulgare  avait lie le sort de la  Bulgarie a celui de PAUemagne.  LeGouvernement  Imperial a en  consequence demande que le Gouvernementbulgare rompe ouvertement avec  les  ennemis des  Puissances de 1&apos;Entente,renvoie (groups undecypherable) immediat  des officiers  appartenant a leursarmees.    &quot;Le soussigne Ministre d&apos;Angleterre  a  (group undecypherable) pourinstructions de s&apos;associer aux demandes  du Gouvernement Imperial  russe.Ces  demandes  n&apos;ayant pas ete aecueillies d&apos;une maniere  satisfaisante, lesoussigne prie  son Excellence le  President du Conseil  et  le Ministre des .Affaires $trangeres de bien voulour lui faire delivrer ses passeports.&quot;     140. The political  necessity  which rendered inevitable thisbreach in  our traditional relations with Bulgaria, hard as  we hadtried to maintain them, appears to have  been fully understood bythe Government.  When Mr. 0&apos;Beirne  presented the note the Prime Sofia, No. 659,Minister declared that  Bulgaria would never  entertain feelings of Oct. 5.enmity towards Great Britain, from  whose hands  she had received f^^f 0ct* 6&apos;nothing  but  good.   He  understood  that we, being  bound by ouralliance with Russia, could not do otherwise than associate ourselveswith her on the present  occasion, but  the sentiments of Bulgariatowards us would always be friendly.     141.  The same evening  we  were informed  that Russia had Petrograd,broken off relations.        &apos;                             .         No. 1469, Oct.. 6,                                                                  9-15 P.M.     142.  Our lot was now definitely cast in with  Greece as against Rome, No, 867,Bulgaria, and at Rome there was  still  hope that  she would not go Oct. 6.back.   Sir R. Rodd reported that  in  the opinion of the Minister for Despatched   ^Foreign Affairs  the resignation of the Greek Prime Minister should 4 p M &apos;not affect  our attitude  in any respect,  but we must be careful notto say or do anything  which  might have the appearance of inter -vening in the internal affairs of Greece.     143.  On  our  part  there was  reason to believe that we had in Foreign Office toour possession a possible means of  turning Greece  from the  Central Athens, No. 849,Powers.   Intelligence had been received from a good source that a Oct. 6.secret treaty  between  Bulgaria, Turkey, Germany,  and Austria- 4.5^ ^eHungary was signed during Prince Hohenlohe&apos;s visit to Sofia onthe 17th July, and  that by its terms  Bulgaria was to receive allAlbania, New Serbia (that is, roughly all the territory south of theline  Prizrend-Tzaribrod), and New Greece.     Sir F. Elliot was informed and  asked to make such use of thisas he thought best.     The financial inducement  was  also used, and he was directed Foreign Office toto let it be known that  so long as  Greece was ready actively to Athens, No. 851,support Serbia in resisting  Bulgarian aggression we were prepared Oct. 6-to help financially whatever Government was in power in Athens.     144.  The weakest  point in our  position was that we were still Foreign Office towithout definite information  as to the terms of  the Serbo-Greek Nish, No. 482,Treaty.  As  our whole case  rested  on  this,  Sir  C. des Graz was Oct. 6.now  asked to ascertain  if possible  its exact terms,  since  it was 4.50^.6important  to know whether that  Treaty bound Greece to enter thewar if Serbia attacked Bulgaria.
Athens, No. 980,       145.  Until the result  of  Sir  F.  Elliots interview  with theOct. 6.         King of Greece was known nothing further could he  done.   His6-40rtMie(i      report came in early on the  7th October.  He had been  received byReceived9-50A.M., the King the previous  morning : 7th.                   (a.) His  Majesty  began by  saying  that  the resignation of              M. Yenizelos  had  changed  nothing.  He  was  determined to              maintain  neutrality as long as possible,  and was obliged to part              with M. Yenizelos  who  had  sone  too  far  in the Chamber in              committing the country to take part in the European war.                  &apos;(&amp;.) M. Zaiimis had undertaken to form a Cabinet.  Mobilisation              would  continue and the Allies could proceed with the disembarka-              tion of troops.                  (c.) Sir F. Elliot asked  the  King whether his statement, that              there was no change, implied that Greece would go to the assistance              of Serbia if attacked by  Bulgaria ?  He  said  he could not reply              without  knowing  the opinion  of his  new   Government,  but              M. Zaimis would visit me to-morrow to state his views.  On being              asked  to say  he would not oppose that  course himself the King              evaded a direct reply, and said it would be time enough to consider              that when  the point arose,  to which Sir F. Elliot retorted that it              would  then be too late  if no preparations  for combined action had              taken place.                  (d.). The King stated  that it was  not  quite  correct to say that              Germany had promised Bulgaria both the contested and uncontested              zones ; what  had  been promised was a free band to take what she              liked, and when Sir F.  Elliot suggested that she would begin with              Kavalla, he replied that the promise only applied to Serbian territory.              Sir E.  Elliot  thereupon  asked  His  Majesty  whether he really              believed that&quot; Germany, if victorious in consequence of the incal-              culable service rendered to her by Bulgaria, Avould interfere  with              her doing what she pleased ?  This question  seemed  to disturb              His Majesty more than all the usual arguments as to the disastrous              results of German domination in the Balkans.                  (e.) The King refused to discuss military plans, but said he had              been pleased  to learn  that  the French troops  were to be pushed              up country at once. He  recognised the  danger-spot near Strum-              nitza, and expected that the 1st  French division would hold  that              point.                  (/.) Sir F. Elliot  then  frankly informed  the  King that he              should   consider it his  duty, in  the event of  M. Stratos being              appointed  Minister of  Marine,  to advise  His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-              ment  to take  over the  whole  supervision of  Greek  territorial              waters, coasts,  and islands.                  (g.) To the  King&apos;s request for his reasons,  he replied with the              story reported  by him  in  his telegram Ao. 403 of the 15th June.*              As the King  asked permission  to inform  M. Gounaris,  Sir Francis              believed  that  the  door   was   now  effectively closed  against              M. Strafcos.                  (h.) His Majesty, on  being told  that  it was essential  there              should  not be a  Germanophil Minister at the  Ministry of Com-              munications, protested it was a mistake to suppose that  any  of his              Ministers were Germanophil.                  (i.) Sir F. Elliot then discussed the money question, and  the              King hinted that if we  stopped the supply  there was no reason why              he should not borrow in America,  or even  in Germany, if he could           .  get it without conditions.   On  being reminded that we had made              the advance unconditionally, His  Majesty laughed,  and said  &quot;I              know what you mean.&quot;                  (j.) Sir F.  Elliot stated that his colleagues and he  thought it              would  be a mistake to stop advances which were being made for                 * Presumably this was to the effect that M. Stratos had accepted money from              the Germans.                  11099-2]                                           C
mobilisation., since the latter was proceeding.   It would be unfor-tunate to drive Greece to Germany for money.    (k.) His Majesty was disturbed by the fact that troops had beenbrought from the Dardanelles to Salonica.  He thought that it wasthe beginning of the abandonment of the expedition, and wouldrelease the whole Turkish army to reinforce the Bulgarians, and inany case he was inclined  to think that  an expedition from Dede-agatch to  Adrianople would present better strategic  possibilitiesthan one from Salonica.    (I.) Sir  F. Elliot  concluded by stating that his audience withthe King had left him less depressed  about the situation than  hehad been the previous night; but, until he had seen M. Zaimis, theonly thing certain was that the  King was determined to  maintainneutrality in all  eventualities if possible.    146. This comparatively hopeful  view was  to  some  extent Athens, No. 988,endorsed by our  military  attache.  He reported that a major of the ^ct- 7-General Staff, who worked in the same office as the Crown  Prince, 3.35^^ Receivedand frequently saw the King, gave  him the following information in-35 A.M.in confidence:     Hope of co-operation of  Greeks should not be abandoned.  Asin March 1915  so now: what  the King was  most afraid of was amilitary fiasco, for the Allies were coming in at last minute, divisionby division  piecemeal, as  we had done at  Gallipoli.   The Kingwished to know  if the 150,000  men being provided by us  wereimmediately available and what our general plan would be.    He recognised that  we  had applied for their plan  in order tosettle ours, but said that, so far as the King was concerned, it was acase of burning his boats, which  he was determined not to do unlesshe saw a reasonable chance of success.    The King would not commit himself until he was assured thecircumstances were such  that there was less prospect of a Serbianreverse, leaving him eventually to face  the whole Bulgarian army.If we could  tell him that we had a larsre force immediatelv availableit would have immense effect.    147. There was still  no sign of a plan being concerted with the Military Attach^,Serbians.  The Greek General Staff  had gone no  further  than to (AlhensAt0 Warinform them their army was  to  be concentrated between Salonica    061  ct&quot; 6&quot;and Kavalla.    The Serbians, howrever, wrere bent on independent action.  Sir Nish, No. 426,C. des Graz reported that the Prime Minister had  gone to head- Oct. 6.quarters to concert immediate operations against Bulgaria, and that j^0-61^ 0ct 7&apos;the Serbian Minister had  been instructed  to leave Sofia contem-poraneously with those of the Entente Powers.    148. At Salonica the landing of our 10th Division was proceed- Admiralty in,ing smoothly without  further protest,  but slowly, owing to the port N,0- 262&apos; 0ct 7&apos;being congested  with the simultaneous disembarkation of  French 12-20 A&apos;M&apos;and  Greek  troops.  The net defences were just completed and theanti-submarine patrols were being extended.  The Kithera Channelwas a special area of the  enemy&apos;s activity, and  here a patrol of sixtrawlers and six drifters  was  established at Milo Island, whitherthe French Naval Chief of Staff Avas proceeding to arrange matters.The French Avere also increasing their  patrols in the Crete-Matapan-Cerigo area.                         37th  Meeting.     149.  When  the  Committee met again at 11*30 on the 7th, Minutes, Oct. 7Lord Kitchener  Avas  able to report  that  our two  brigades hadlanded and that  no other troops Avere now moving.     (a.) The  main question to  be decided Avas whether the move-ment of troops  to Salonica  should continue,  with the object  of
tsupporting Serbia and  preventing or delaying the German attemptto open a way to Constantinople.    (6.) Unless the way was barred it was probable we should haveto abandon Gallipoli, and there appeared to be technical  difficultiesin the way of getting sufficient troops into Serbia in  time foreffective action.   The  General Staff had not sufficient informationto say with certainty whether  these difficulties were insuperable ornot.   They related to  sea transport  and also to railway transport,and embarkation facilities in France.    (c.) A preliminary appreciation prepare i  by the General Staffgave four weeks as a possible period within which Austrian suppliescould begin  to reach  Gallipoli.  The  intelligence  on  which thisestimate was  based was that the Serbs had six divisions in thenorth and  north-west  facino; seven Austro-German divisions whichwere probably under strength.  On the  east they had  their  otherfive divisions facing four Bulgarian  divisions.   Of the rest of theBulgarian army three divisions were observing the Greeks and fourwere held back in the east.    (d.) Assuming that these dispositions, with the assistance ofthe French division,  would not suffice to prevent the Germansbreaking through, the  courses  open to us were -    (1.) To attempt at once to force  through  at Gallipoli with all           available forces.    (2.) To abandon  Gallipoli  and attack  at  Alexandretta  and           elsewhere on the Asiatic side.    (3.) To concentrate on assisting Serbia.    (4.) To arrange with the  French for them  to carry on  from           Salonica, while we operated from Dedeagatch,  Saros,           or the Asiatic side.                   (e.) A  prolonged  discussion brought out the  fact  that no              resolution  could  be reached  until  we  knew what the  French              proposed to  do, and  had further expert  advice as to whether we              could hold on to Gallipoli if  the Germans succeeded in opening              communications with Constantinople.                   (/.) The question of what we could do if we  had to evacuate              Gallipoli was also *seen to turn  on  technical considerations, and              finally it was decided to refer the whole  matter to  the War Staff              and General Staff to  bring up an appreciation for  the consideration              of the Committee at its next meeting.                           *                   (g.) The instruction was &quot;to prepare an appreciation on the              &quot; hypothesis that Germany, and Austria are able to open up through              &quot; communications with Constantinople in the near future, stating              &quot; their  opinion as to whether in  this  event we  should be  able to              &quot; hold on at  Gallipoli;  and to advise  as to the military action to be              &quot; taken either to avert this contingency or to safeguard our Eastern              &quot; Empire if it should occur.&quot;                   150. The difficulty of deciding definitely on the right course of              action was increased by the uncertain attitude of Russia, who appeared              still to  be unready to  back  her  ultimatum.   As it was her action              that had precipitated the crisis, it was natural to  look to her for a              lead, but she was  obviously  unwilling  to commit herself before              we did.                   Sir G. Buchanan stated that the  Minister for Foreign  Affairs,              in view of  the resignation of  M. Yenizelos, said  that the&quot; Russian9-ITP.M. deceived Government could not under the present conditions  join in the11-30 A.&apos;M., 7th.   projected loan to Greece.                   As regards the proposal that  Russia  should send a detachment              of troops to Serbia, M. Sazonof had informed the French Ambassador              that, according to a telegram just received from headquarters, the              Emperor  approved in  principle, but  said that no troops could be              sent until the military  operations on  the Russian front had  madePetrograd,No. 1471, Oct. 6
further progress and until it was known  how many troops Franceand England proposed to send.    151. Erance was for taking action  without any further delay,regardless of the Greek attitude.  Lord  Bertie  reported that our Paris, No. 730idea of not proceeding further at  Salonica till the attitude of the Oct. 7.new Greek  Government was  made clearer  was not  approved atParis, for reasons to be communicated later.    152. That  the  Greek attitude would not  be what we wishedsoon became apparent.   That  night Sir  E. Elliot stated that the Athens, No. 995,representatives  of  the four Powers  had been  received together Oct. 7.by M.  Zaimis that  evening.   M. Zaimis  declared that the policy        Receivedof  the Government would  continue  to be  one of  benevolent 10 A&quot;iM&apos;i5 8th.neutrality to the Entente, who  had  the  sympathies of everyone inGreece.  Every facility would be given to our troops  in Salonica.The  Greek  mobilisation  would continue in  full  force  for thepresent.  He added  that  the  question  whether Greece   was  tosupport Serbia  against a Bulgarian attack was to be discussed  bythe Cabinet the following day  (8th).    153. Meanwhile  the  Austro-German attack on  the northern Nish. No. 431,front  had begun.  Sir 0. des Graz reported that Belgrade had been Oct. ^   dheavily shelled  on the 6th and  7th, that the Save had been crossed 8-30P.M. Receivedat three points  and the Danube at two.  Eighting continued.       n A.M., 8th.    154. The attitude of  Boumania was.  still as  uncertain as thatof Greece,  but Sir  G. Barclay stated  that he had it on  high Bucharest,authority that  if the Allies would only take steps immediately to No. 637, Oct. 7,establish themselves in force in the  Balkan Peninsula, it would only ify$Q-p.ube a question of a few weeks before the Prime Minister decided in Receivedfavour of intervention on their  side.                               H&quot;25 A.M., 8th.    M. Jonesco told the  commercial attache that, in  his  opinion,the whole issue of  the war would be decided by the progress ofevents in the Balkans during the next two months, and in view ofthe unfavourable turn of  events in Bulgaria and Greece, nothingbut prompt and determined action on the part of the Allies couldsave the situation.   Both the Bulgarian Minister  and the King hadto his (M. Jonesco&apos;s) knowledge spoken of a secret  understandingbetween the Kings of Bulgaria  and  Greece, presumably to the effectthat if Serbia could  be  crushed before  Greece was ready to assisther, the latter would then escape her treaty obligations, and underGermany&apos;s guarantee, as  a reward for her  dilatory policy, wouldeventually enjoy a large slice of the conquered country.    155. It  became clearer every day that Greece did  not  mean tohold herself bound by the Serbo-Greek Treaty.    Sir P.  Elliot stated that  M. Zaimis  had  told  the  Serbian Athens, No. 1000,Minister the  previous day that,  when  that  treaty  was  signed, Oot-8-M. Yenizelos gave the Austrian Minister a  declaration  in  writing il^ra^Beceivedthat it was  a purely Balkan arrangement, and had no reference to 4.55 P.M.Austria.  The   Serbian Minister  was convinced  that the  GreekGovernment would decide not to support Serbia.     Indications of an understanding  between the Bulgarian andGreek Sovereigns (Bucharest  telegram  No. 637) were growing.There  had  been no references recently to Bulgarian claims  toKavalla.   The  hostility to Bulgaria, which was such a markedfeature of the views  of the Court, had also abated.     Sir F. Elliot suggested that it  might become a question for usAvhether by cutting off supplies we should not starve Greece into arevolution against the King who was ruining her  future prospects.     The  concentration of the Greek army was actually  being Athens, No. 1001,stopped.  The  military attache  reported that  the Athens and Patras Oct. 8.army corps, who ought to have left for Macedonia, had not done so, S A.M                                                                Received 4*20 P.M.

Greystatement of the attitude of the Allies : -     &apos;&apos; The Allies have promised 150,000 men to aid Greece in carrying1 outher treaty obligations to Serbia.  We cannot doubt that  Greece  means tofulfil her obligations, and if so we shall certainly fulfil ours.  It is difficult tobelieve that there is any  danger of Greek  Government pronouncing infavour  of neutrality.   Should Serbia  fall, Greece&apos;s  position  in Balkanswould  be gone for ever, and Bulgarian predominance would be assured.  If,however, in spite of these considerations  Greek Government adopt thedisastrous policy of neutrality, it is very difficult to see how Allies&apos; militaryoperations could be carried  out  through  a neutral  country  which  hadmobilised but which refused to fight, and which would neither enter into anymilitary engagements with Allies nor  discuss  with  them any militaryplans.&quot;     157. By  this time Sir 0. des  Graz had been  able to obtain somelight on  the nature  of  the Greek  liabilitv  to  Serbia,  and hadtelegraphed   the following translation  of part  of  the  secrettreaty :     &quot; If one of the two parties without any provocation should be attackedby a third Power, the two parties engage to assist each other with the wholeof their armed forces.&quot;Nish, No. 429,Oct. 7.Despatched8-30 P.M.Received 9-25 A.M.8th.Nish, No. 436,Oct. 9.Despatched2-30 P.M.Received10-10 A.M., 10th.     He  added  that  there wras  also  a secret militarv convention annexed  to the treaty, mentioning the special  case of an unexpected attack by Bulgaria, and there were further stipulations to meet the case of one  of the  two parties being already at war and relating to  the number of  troops  with which that country would engage all the same to assist the other.     The information had  been  given him by permission  of  the Prime Minister, and he was asked that it should be considered most confidential.     He was able to amplify it next day, when he reported that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs  had given  him the  following further particulars, again impressing upon him that the information was most secret.     The following is the translation of the Erench precis of various passages  which the Acting Minister read.   He said  that the&apos;other articles did not bear on the question.     The  following sentence  should precede the  passage quoted in telegram No. 4*28 :      &quot; The two contracting parties mutually guaranteed to each other  their territorial  possessions.&quot;     The  next article, he said, treated of delimitation of frontier.     Article 3 runs as follows :      &quot; The contracting parties considering it to be of vital  interest to them that no other Power should come between the Serbian and Greek territories to the west of Vardar, declare solemnly that they will assist each other so that they may have a common frontier.&quot;     Another  passage runs :     &quot; If an agreement between Bulgaria on one side  and Serbia and Greece on the  other, with regard to the above-mentioned frontiers, is  not possibleby pacific  means even by arbitration of the heads  of States of the TripleEntente, and if Bulgaria adopts a menacing attitude, or attacks them in orderto impose  her pretensions, Greece and Serbia promise to come to the assistanceof each other with the whole of their armed forces.&quot;     The treaty was signed in 1913, and was to remain in force forten years.    &quot;[1099-2]                                              D
    The following passage of  a secret  military  convention  wascontained in an annexure to the treaty :     1. &quot;In case of a war between the contracting parties and a third party,or in case Bulgaria  should attack with considerable forces the Serbian orGreek army, Serbia and Greece promise to aid each other with all their landand naval forces.    2. &quot; When and at whatever moment hostilities begin, Serbia is obligedto place 150,000  men on  the line of  Gbevgheli-Kumanovo-Pirot, andGreece 90,000 men on the line Bangheon-Salonica-Strumnitza.    3. The fleet must be immediately equipped in theiEgean. The contractingparties engage to  transport their troops as soon as they are  free into thezone of military operations.&quot;    As against this, Sir  F. Elliot reported  that he had seen  three  Athens, No. 1018,Cabinet Ministers who all stated positively that Greece would not  Oct. 9-^^depart from her neutrality until attacked.   M. Zaimis had made the  ^jP^ deceivedsame  declaration to his French and Russian colleagues.              9-50 A.M., loth.    158.  Meanwhile  various  methods  of  temoting  Greece  into  Athens, No. 990,action were being put forward.  Our military  attache at Athens  j^1-   faedsuggested that,  in view of the danger caused by the proximity of  10 P.M.  Receivedthe Bulgarian frontier north of Lake Doiran, it might be advisable  9-40 A.M.. 8th.to induce  the Serbians to  cede  the so-called &quot; Enclave&quot; to theGreeks immediately.   The frontier would be thus rectified, and theGreeks would be obliged to  extend their left further north, wdiilethere would be distinct material gains to the Serbians.    This was so far approved that next day Sir C. des Graz was told  Foreign Office tohe might mention it to M. Basitch for his consideration.             odfs^0, *88&apos;     Sir F. Elliot also reported that it had been suggested to him,  Despatched 7 PMas a further useful bait  for the  King of Greece, the Government,  Athens  No 1009and especially the people, that Serbia should offer to cede Monastir,  Oct. s.&apos;which she had before consented to part with to Bulgaria, and which  DespatchedGreece had always coveted.                                        Received9-45AM     He further proposed that as the Greeks were  beginning to ask  nth.         &apos;what material advantage they would gain by supporting Serbia, an  Athens  No 1012offer such as was  proposed in Foreign Office telegram No. 2286 to  Oct. 8.&apos;Petrograd (re cession of territory in Asia  Minor to Greece)  would  Despatchedprod uce an excellent effect, and  might be  coupled with a  declara-  Received 9-3&apos; Ation that if they did not fulfil their treaty engagements they  would  9th.         &apos; &quot;&apos;lose the friendship of France and England.     He had already taken steps to have  published the information  Athens, No. 1011,contained in Foreign Office  telegram No. 849, regarding a  secret  0ct- 8-treaty said to  have  been  concluded  between  Bulgaria,  Turkey,  ^fff^edGermany, and Austria-Hungary.  It was  to appear in an Athens  Received 9-30 A.si.,newspaper on the following  day, but he added that  it would be  9th.useful if he could be told its source.     In reply he was  told that as the source could not be revealed  Foreign Office tono further publication should be made.                             Athens.

France on her part  was doing  her best  to  induce Russiato co-operate in the attempt to assist Serbia,     Sir G.  Buchanan reported that the French Ambassador was  Petrograd,being instructed to  ask for an audience of  the Emperor in order to  No- 1477\ 0ct- 8.point out  the great  importance which  the  French  Government  j^p^hedattached to the despatch of  a Russian contingent to Salonica.  He  Receivedwras also to urge that the Black  Sea Fleet should  make  a  naval  10-10 A.M., 9th.demonstration before Varna and Bourgas.     The French Ambassador proposed to suggest the despatch  of8,000 troops to Salonica via Archangel.     Sir George had  little  hope  of success, for the Minister forForeign Affairs had told him that  the shortage  of  rifles and thedifficulty of transport had hitherto proved insurmountable obstacles.He had also  remarked that  the naval  demonstration off Varnaand Bourgas would be dangerous owing to  the presence of Germansubmarines in those ports.

Still  the  Erench Ambassador was authorised  by his  Govern-ment, in case Russia declined to move, to remind her of the sacrificesErance and England were making for her at Gallipoli, and of howa suspicion that  Constantinople  had been  assigned  her  had pre-judiced our prospects with the Balkan States.     160.  Some difficulty, however, was felt by our Government insupporting this demarche of the Erench, and our Ambassador wastold that  the  despatch of troops to  Salonica had not yet  beendefinitely settled, and until our decision  had been taken we couldnot urge  the  Russian  Government to join us.  Me was directed,therefore, to ask his Erench colleague to postpone his request for anaudience  of the Emperor  until the Erench Government had beenconsulted. The Erench Ambassador, however, objected that it wasnow too late to ask for a postponement of the audience.  It was totake place next day (10th), and  the Minister  for  Foreign  Affairsseemed to think  that  the Emperor  would  make no difficultiesabout the despatch of Russian troops if transport and rifles wereprovided.    161. Erom  Athens  the military attacheresult of his audience with the King1 thatnow  reported  themorning.     (a.) His Majesty said that his  present attitude was determined by his general disinclination to take sides in  the European conflict. He did not wish to fight  either against Germany or with her, and for that reason considered that he  had  no obligations towards the Serbians.   They  had  declared  war  on  Germany  unnecessarily without consulting him, and that was a contingency he would never admit came within the scope of a purely Balkan treaty.     (b.) He recognised that if the Serbians fell on account of Greek defection  a great  revulsion of feeling  against him and his people would take place in England and Erance.     (c.) As regards the military aspect, he  said that the Serbian Military Commissioner, had asked him to send three army corps to Egri Palanka, which, apart from political reasons, he was unable to do  for  military reasons.  He said  that he would be very pleased to hear of our doing so, but his Staff calculated that it would take us eight weeks to get up there to act decisively.  He stated that if he became involved in the war his forces would probably co-operate by the Struma Valley,  &quot; but it would take a great deal to involve him.&quot;     (d.) We could regard Salonica as  a perfectly safe  base, since the Greeks would oppose any attempt to reach it on the  part of the Bulgarians.   Should,   on   the  other  hand,   an  Austro-German- Bulgarian force demand a free passage, the vital interests of Greece would obviously be involved.   ^(e.) The King stated that  the objection to  the   immediate possession of Doiran or Monastir was that in  either case &quot; it would involve me in war  with Bulgaria,  whicli I wish to avoid.&quot;     (/.) When*the military attache pointed out that  he had asked for 150,000 men and permitted us to change our plan, and now, by hesitating, was setting free to  act against us the  Bulgarians, who had been sent to watch him when  his  intention of mobilising  was declared, he  said that he  would see that the position  of  Greece should  always remain so  uncertain that the troops  could not be withdrawn, and added  that the Government would not make anystatement committing Greece definitely to neutrality.     ((/.) The military attache  remarked that  the same impressionmust not be given  by  slowing  up  the  process of concentration orconstant semi-official assurances that Greece  would never move, to which His Majesty replied that he would bring these matters to  thenotice of the Government.(h.) Referring to the immediate future, he  said hethoughtBulgaria would not attack after all, and that if  she did she would
 leave Greece alone, and  referring to the ultimate future, be  said &quot; he would sooner do to-morrow what he did not want to do to-day, &quot; and if he had to attack Bulgaria later he would do so alone if all &quot; his friends were alienated by his present decision.&quot;      (i.) He told the military attache finally that the feeling  of  his men was not  the same as  in 1913.  Perhaps they would become more keen as matters developed, but our  recent negotiations with Bulgaria and the &quot; Kavalla  question &quot; had made enthusiasm on the part of  the Greeks for a Bulgarian  war for the moment out  of the question.      162. The general impression gained from the audience  was Athens, No. 1015, that the King  was possessed by  a fixed idea which was  most $^patched embarrassing, and which would  be  difficult to remove.  Eor  this 7 PM-  Received reason,  in the opinion of the military attache, the Dedeagatch  line 12 noon, 10th. would be more attractive were it  not for the impression that might be conveyed that we were abandoning Serbia.  If  we continued to send men to Serbia we were justified in regarding our base as secure up to the limit of the Greek frontier, but not a yard beyond it, and that until our concentration was complete we  should rest content with the Greek attitude.     He  recommended  that  the   Doiran-Monastir  suggestion should  be  tried, and hoped that the measures now being  taken to stir  up  the Greeks  might bear  fruit  by  the  time hostilities commenced.     The publication of the secret treaty had created a great stir in Athens, No. 1020, Athens, but Sir  E. Elliot reported that corroborative evidence was ^ a^ched required to clinch it in face of the categorical denial issued by the 7-3np.1t. Received German Minister.  This evidence, we have seen, it was not considered 9-55 P.M. possible to produce.     163. In the  other Balkan  States signs were not wanting that the enforced delay in the Allied action was beginning to tell.     There was a rumour in Bucharest that we were  abandoning the Bucharest, No. 642. operations in the Dardanelles, which had created a bad impression; 0ct-10- while from Nish Sir  0.  des Graz  reported  that  the attitude  of y-X^ Received Greece and the non-arrival of the  Erench troops who were expected 12-15 &quot;p  jr the previous day had caused a  feeling of dejection.                  Nish No. 439     He had been told, however, that afternoon at the Ministry for Oct. 10. Eoreign Affairs that the Serbian  troops were  holding the  Germans Despatched back near  Belgrade,  and that the  fighting was   of the fiercest J0on&apos;f&apos;   ]J^lved ,    .  .      0     &apos;                 00                      / o(J A.M., lltn. description.     164. The  immediate Serbian anxiety was  for  what  Bulgaria might do on their eastern front, and on this they were approaching the  Greek  Government  for concerting  a joint plan  of action. Sir E. Elliot reported that the  Serbian Minister had that  day told  Athens,  No. 1022, M. Zalmis that in presence of the threatening attitude of  Bulgaria  Oct. 10.  ?. the Serbian Government considered a casus fozderis4had arisen, and  ^Q^Mdeceived called upon the Greek  Government to allow the two General Staffs  9.20 A.M. nth. to concert measures of defence.     M.. Zalmis replied that  the  treaty had been made  in view of purely Balkan  troubles, and  that  the presence of Germany in the field altered the situation completely.     Upon the Serbian Minister contesting  this view, M. Zalmis said  that the  German  Emperor had told the King  of  Greece that war with Bulgaria meant war with Germany.  The Prime  Minister added that  M. Venizelos was aware  of  this before he  made his speech.    The  Serbian  Minister,  however,  said  he  does  not believe it.    165. This  practically put an  end to all hope  of co-operationfrom the Greek army for the present, but from Hussia the newswas more encouraging.
Petrograd,           Sir  G. Buchanan reported that at the audience granted on theNo. 1488,        previous day to the French Ambassador the Emperor had agreed toDes aiched       despatch a Russian force to Salonica by way of Archangel, and had3-40IP.M.  Received  a^so consented to the proposal that the Russian fleet should bombard4-40 P.M.         Varna and Bourgas after  the  first act of  hostility committed by               Bulgaria against Serbia.                   Our Ambassador added that he had  informed the  Minister of               Foreign Affairs of  M. Zaiimis&apos;s  answer to the Serbian demand for               the fulfilment  of  the secret treaty, and that the Minister was of               opinion that the time had come for us to give Greece to understand               that we must hold her to her treaty obligations to Serbia.  He quite               agreed that it was necessary to -hold firm language at Athens, and               that we could starve Greece in a fortnight.                                        38th Meeting.Minutes, Oct. 11.       ^ 66. When on the 11th October the Committee met to  decide               the steps we should take on the information before it, Lord Kitchener               was able to give General Joffre&apos;s view.Summary of          (a.) It was  to the effect that we were bound not to  desertGeneral Joffre&apos;s    Serbia, but as the enemy had the initiative there must be no questionnote, Oct. 9.      Q^ a generai action.  We should confine our operations to  securing               Salonica as a base, to holding the railway from Saloniea  to Uskub,               and to preventing an attempt on  Central  Serbia by covering the               Serbian right.  For these objects 150,000 men would suffice, and on               no account could the  French  assist in any large effort; for any               further action the British Government  must be responsible, but he               strongly recommended that Italy should be urged  to send a force               to Salonica and eventually to open an entry from Durazzo.                   (b.)  The joint appreciation of  the War Staff and General Staff,               called for at the last meeting, was  also  before the Committee.  It               took as its premiss that our force at Gallipoli, in  case of a tactical               defeat, might be lost, and that such a tactical defeat might take               place if the  Central Powers could open free communication for men               and supplies with Turkey.   The possibility was that such communi-               cation could be opened  by the end of October, unless  the  Allied               Powers  could  do something to  delay  or  prevent it;  otherwise               supplies might begin  to  reach Gallipoli by the third  week in               November, but in view  of German difficulties it might well take               longer.                   (c.)  If  the promised 150,000  men were provided, our best zone               of operations in concert with the Greek and Serbian armies would               be Osogov and the Strumnitza, but they could  hardly all reach               Salonica before the beginning of December, and owing to  the poor               communication it would be  the middle of the month before they               could operate with effect.   It  must also be considered  that little               dependence  could be placed on the Greek army, while our own new               armies, with no experience of manoeuvring in the field, would  not be               superior  to the Bulgarians.                   (d.)  On the other hand severe pressure by the Allies, and espe-               cially by Russia, wroukl reduce the number of Austro-Germans avail-               able to perhaps 200,000, but at present  Russia can hardly be  ready               to exert such pressure.                   (e.)  On the whole, the combined Staff was of opinion that the               risk involved in detailing 150,000  men  to Serbia was too  great to               undertake on the  slender hope of  being able  to stojD  munitions               reaching the Turks.                  (/.)  There was in addition the  consideration that  the  operations               once  commenced  might develop  so  largely as  to involve an               unendurable strain on our forces both by land and sea.                  (g.)  The possibilities  of  stopping the supply of  munitions by               operating from other points  east  of Salonica were less  promising               and more hazardous than from Salonica  itself.

    Qi.) This being so, they considered the alternatives open to uswere as follows :     1. An advance on Chanak on the Asiatic side,    2. Reinforcements to Gallipoli for a new offensive.    3. Possibility of holding Gallipoli if the Turks got munitions.    4. Withdrawing from Gallipoli at once.    (i.) The first alternative was negatived ;  the second might beattempted if the forces could not be better employed elsewhere.   Ifthis were  decided on, it covered 3 and 4.  They were still strongly ofopinion that the war plan, which rested on obtaining  a decision inFrance with all possible forces, should  not be changed, but if  theresumption  of the offensive were to be  postponed for three monthsand troops could be spared, the best use  to make  of  them was indefence of our Eastern Empire,  and that could best be  done byachieving success in Gallipoli.    (j.) It was recognised, however, that the fact of the Frenchhaving just committed themselves to assisting Serbia, might entail adeparture from  the purely strategical  considerations on whichthese appreciations had proceeded.    (h.) The  difficulty of coming  to a decision was therefore verygreat.  The combined staff had fully  taken  into consideration thepolitical drawback of appearing to  desert  Serbia, but to these AverenoAV added  the objections of appearing to desert France.     (I.) In these conditions the first question to settle was whetherwe should concentrate on the West and develop further our effort inthe Near East.  The conclusion  Avas that  as the long-preparedoffensive  in the  West was oyer, and not likely to be renewed forsome months, the promised troops could be spared from that side.     (m.)  The  difficulty  of  deciding in  wdiat particular  directionour  Near  Eastern  effort should  develop  was  greater.   Whilepolitical  considerations   were all  in  favour of  operating  from Salonica, the  naval  and militarv  considerations Avere  all againstadopting  that line.   As to Gallipoli, the general  sense  of  theCommittee seems to have been that the moral and political objectionsto abandoning it overweighed those against abandoning Serbia,     (n.)  It was  also  generally felt that  there were  still  toomany uncertain  factors,  especially in  regard to the  intentions ofRussia, Greece,  and  Roumania  for any  thoroughly satisfactorydecision to  be come to;  and, further, that no immediate  decisionwas necessary so long as the troops were  sent  out at once to sameplace aVarmes on the  Near East Avhence they could act  promptly inthe direction that eventually promised the best results.     (o.) Meanwhile  it Avas  proposed to attempt to reconstruct theBalkan League by informing Greece and Boumania that if theyAvould come in to  the assistance  of Serbia  the Allies Avould  put 250,000 men in the field by the 1st January, 1916.   In  order todetermine the uncertain military possibilities of the situation it wasagreed that a  fresh opinion on the spot Avas necessary.     (p)  The  conclusions then were      (1.) To order the troops, as soon as the current operations were            over in France, to be despatched to Egypt.     (2.)  A specially selected General to  proceed to the Near East            to report the best sphere for them to act in.     (3.) The General Staff to consider how their appreciation Avould            be modified if Greece and Boumania came in.     167.  The degree  of  success with wdiich  the policy decided onwas likely  to  meet clearly depended on  the  amount of resistanceSerbia could  oppose to the Austro-German  invasion  by her  ownefforts, and secondly upon the adhesion or abstention of Greece  andRoumania.
Nish, No. 442,         The morning after the meeting  a telegram was received fromOct. 11.          Sir c. des Graz to say that a small Bulgarian detachment had made97oPpMheReceived  an attack ana! na^ Deen repulsed  by the Serbians that morning atn A.M., 12th.     Tt-adi Bogas, in the neighbourhood of Vrania.                   The Prime Minister,  who gave  him  the  news, had returned               from headquarters quite confident,  and  spoke with pride of  the               admirable  manner in which  the  Serbian army, fighting day and               night, were holding the Germans in check.  He thought that the               Germans would find the greatest difficulty moving their big guns if               they advanced further into the country.  He expressed the earnest               hope that  the Allied forces  would  arrive soon, and  that  heavy               artillery might be sent.Nish, No. 443,Oct. 11.Despatched2 P.M.

Sir 0. des Graz also reported that he had  mentioned thematter of the suggested cession  of  the Enclave  to  Greece.  ThePrime Minister said he would bear it in mind, but would not dareto put forward the idea at a moment when the Greeks were showingthemselves so unfaithful to their treaty obligations.    The Serbian Government would again communicate with theGreek Government, and point out that  if Greece continued in herpresent  line  of conduct  Serbia also would consider herself freedfrom obligations of treaty.    The  Prime  Minister expressed  confidence  that, if  Serbiareceived the help of the Allied forces soon, it would  be possible toensure the safety  of the line  of communication to Salonica, eitherwith Serbian or Allied troops.    In  a later telegram he deprecated our making to the SerbianGovernment  any  suggestion concerning  the cession of territory suchas that  with regard to Monastir.  It  would  in his opinion have adisastrous effect on the morale of the army.    In reply to his desire that the Serbian Government should bereassured in the matter of the assistance  for  which they  werehoping, all  that  could be said  was that the  disembarkation ofBritish  troops  at Salonica was  continuing,  but  in view  of theundetermined attitude  of  the  Greek  King,  Government,  andGeneral  Staff the troops had no  orders to proceed beyond Salonicaat present.Bucharest,No.&apos;647, Oct. 11.Despatched 5 P.M                   169. Erom Bucharest our military attache reported  that the               enemy did not appear yet to have succeeded in getting a sufficientlyReceived         permanent footing on the right bank  of the  Danube to construct11-45 A.M., Oct. 12.  bridges,  but in view of their great numerical  superiority  this was               only  a matter of time, and  the best  we  could expect from the               Serbians  was to delay operations.   Moreover, we  had heard from               various sources that the Serbians were disgusted with the treatment               that they had received from  the Allies, and were not disposed  to               make sacrifices  in  Northern Serbia while the  Bulgarians  attacked               their sole remaining line of communications.                   In his opinion the best way of helping Serbia and preventing               the arrival of munitions at Constantinaple was to attack Dedeagatch,               Varna, and B our gas.                   He  still  thought that if large German forces were committed               to operations south of the Danube  there was  a  possibility that               lloumania would intervene  on our side, and this possibility would               become almost a certainty  if there were a reasonable prospect  of               the Dardanelles being forced  within two or three months.  Until               that happened lloumania could not possibly replenish her supply  of               munitions.                   jNothing was  known at  Bucharest of  the  intentions  of the               Allies.  An  assurance  that   we were  taking vigorous  measures               against Bulgaria and were sparing no effort to reach Constantinople               before  the Germans could  not fail  to  produce  a good  effect.               As things  stood  at present even  our warmest supporters were               depressed.
     170.  One point at least was clear-that the eventual attitudeof E/Oumania must mainly turn on that of Russia; and in view of theimportance of  securing the assistance which the Emperor had  con-ditionally promised, Sir R. Rodd was directed to urge, that Italy, in  Foreign Office toreturn for the great assistance, financial and otherwise, that she had  ^mJ9No&apos;182(3&apos;received from us, should send the Vetterli rifles and ammunition which  Despatchedshe had to spare at once to Russia, and that the German ships  locked  2-15 P.M.up in Italian ports should be made available for use, as were Germanships in other Allied ports.   The latter point was most important.     171.  As yet Italy had made no definite  declaration as to directco-operation, but  Sir 0. des Graz  was directed to enquire  of  the  Foreign Office toSerbian Government whether they wished us  to  urge the  Italian  Nish, No. 497,Government to send troops through Albania.                        Oct. 12.     In the same  connection Lord Bertie reported that the Erench  2-55 P.M.Government were studying, with their military and naval  autho-  PariSi No  746rities, the ways  and means of sending  troops to Serbia via, Durazzo,  Oct. 12.hut realised the political difficulties  caused by Italian, Serbian, and  DespatchedGreek  jealousies.  They seemed to hope  that  Italy  would  send a     p^r Receivedsmall force to co-operate with the Erench and British.     They thought that the  material difficulties could be  overcomeby improving  the  roads and building railways within  two and a-halfmonths.     172.  The next  step, in  conformity with the conclusions of theCommittee, was to set on foot  measures for the restoration  of  theBalkan League.  To this end Sir G. Barclay wras directed  to inform  Foreign Office tothe  Roumanian Minister for  Eoreign Affairs  that  Bulgaria  had  Bucharest,No.577,already attacked  Serbia,  and that if Roumania  desired  that  the  Oct. 12-Balkan equilibrium  should  not  be  entirely  upset to  the  sole  8.50Pp,t hedadvantage of Bulgaria and  her Austro-German allies, she ought  tomobilise at once on the Bulgarian frontier and let  the BulgarianGovernment know that she  would regard  attacks  on Serbia  as anunfriendly act.  The Minister for Eoreign  Affairs  must see thatunless  Roumania supports  Serbia she would  deeply regret that,without moving a finger, she  allowed the existence of her  friendand former ally, Serbia, to be placed in great peril.     173.  With regard to Greece, Sir E. Elliot had been requested to Foreign Office tothank  M. Zaimis  for his declaration that every facility would be  Athens, No. 875,given to our troops at Salonica.                                    dIS atehed 3PM     A few hours later Sir Edward Grey, after  informing  him that ^p  ^ office^cTaccording  to information received  from the Serbian Government Athen^ No C8770the  Bulgarians have  already attacked  the Serbian  army, gave Oct. 12.instructions that he should urge upon M. Zaimis the  consideration Despatchedthat effective support to Serbia  must depend upon the   active 6&apos;30 P,M*co-operation of  the Greek  army against  Bulgaria.  The   Alliedtroops  already landed could not be used effectively and quicklyexcept in conjunction with  the Greek army, and it was impossiblefinally to decide further military plans  except in consultation withGreece.  It would seem inevitable that the consequence of leavingSerbia unsupported would be disastrous to Greece.     174. Einally,  Sir E.  Elliot was informed  that  the following Foreign Office tooffer had  been  made  to  Roumania and  was  to  be  repeated  to Athens, No. 884.Greece -                                                       0ct-12-Vjrieeoe&apos;                                                          Despatched    &quot; The only effective manner in which help can be given to Serbia is by 10&apos;50 P,M*the  immediate declaration of Avar by Roumania  and Greece against theAustro-Germans  and Bulgaria.  The British Government  would in thatevent be prepared to sign  forthwith a military convention with  Roumaniawhereby Great Britain will  guarantee to bring into  action in the Balkantheatre, not including the forces already in Gallipoli, an army of at least200,000 men. If the French send a force, as they contemplate doing, thatforce would be part of this total; but, if not, the British Government wouldundertake to provide the whole number themselves.
    &quot; This force  would include  a number of our best and most seasoneddivisions, and we  shall maintain  them in the field waging war on behalf ofour Allies till the objective is accomplished.  A steady flow of troops willcommence as soon as transport is available, and will be continuously main-tained.  We  estimate that 150,000  men will  be available by the end ofNovember, and the total, 200,000, will be reached by the end of the year.   - &quot; The military convention will state precisely the dates at which thedifferent portions of the army will arrive.    &quot; We are repeating this offer to Greece, and if Roumania is prepared toact immediately we shall call  upon Greece imperatively to fulfil her treatyobligations to Serbia.    &quot; We also believe it to be in our  power to despatch to Russia within thenext two months a sufficient number  of rifles to enable  her to equip and putinto the field at least 500,000 additional trained men, in order that Rxissiamay develop strong and concerted action with Roumania in the southerntheatre.&quot;Athens, No. 1028,Oct. 12.5Despatched 8 P.M.Received9-15 A.M., 13th.Foreign Office toAthens, No. 886,Oct. 13.Despatched11-10 A.W.Athens, No. 1031,Oct. 12.Despatched 10 P.M.Received 9-10 AM.,13th.     Sir F. Elliot was  further directed to notify the Greek Govern-ment that they must definitely  choose whether  they would  fulfiltheir treaty  obligations or  not.  In the  event  of their  doing sowe were prepared to enter into a similar convention with them.     The Greek Government were to be  requested to give a specificanswer within  forty-eight  hours  contingent  upon the  entry oflloumania.     If M. Venizelos approved, Sir F. Elliot was to add :  &quot; A refusal&quot; on  the part of the Greek Government to join  Roumania  and&quot; ourselves would profoundly modify the relations  of this country&quot; to Greece.&quot;     175. At the same time  Sir F. Elliot was sending his  views onthe suggestion of coercing Greece by some form of naval blockade.He stated that in his opinion a partial measure of prohibition wouldirritate the  King and the  Greek  people against us and have nopractical effect, except to damage British trade.     Many of M. Venizelos&apos;s party advocated a naval demonstrationand the blockade of Piraeus by us,  with a view to  bringing aboutthe King&apos;s abdication  in favour of the Crown Prince; but a revo-lution would be difficult to bring about while the army was mobilised,and the feelings of the citizens were merely those of the soldier.     He admitted, however, that a famine might be created in threeweeks by the  stoppage  of grain-ships only.   If,  therefore, theexpedition from Salonica was not  proceeded with, Greece shouldbe told that she had forfeited our friendship  through her defectionfrom Serbia;  that as soon as Germany  had  obtained possession ofthe railway, Salonica  would be blockaded to prevent the  passageof goods to Germany; and that if it was found that goods passedover  the  land, Piraeus and  Volo  would  also be blockaded.  If, onthe  other hand, the expedition proceeded, every  effort should  bemade to bring Greece  in by  promises of Monastir, Doiran, and theThracian  coast,  coupled with threats of coercive action.     Sir F. Elliot was then told to make it clear that if Greece joinednow her territory would be guaranteed, and she would receive properterritorial acquisitions  at the end of the  war.     Shortly afterwards he was able to report that he had called  onM.  Venizelos  to consult  him  about  the  situation.   When  hesuggested that  coercive measures  might  have to  be  applied  toGreece, M. Venizelos begged to be excused from giving  an  opinionwith regard to measures directed against his country.     Sir F. Elliot said that when he went on to suggest the promisesindicated  in telegram No. 1028 (cession  of territory), M. Venizelosreplied that, in his opinion, they would have a  great  effect, andmight rouse public opinion to such an extent as to  carry the Kingwith it or drive him to abdicate  if  he was  too  far bound to  theGerman Emperor.[1099-2]
IS     176. Every hour it was becoming more important to give some Nish, No. 444,definite assurance to  Serbia.   Sir  0. des Graz now reported that Oct. 1Janother  Bulgarian attack had been made on the previous day in ;v3oPp,M.ethe neighbourhood of Zaichar, and that  Bulgarians bad occupied Received 10 A.M.,points in Serbian territory about a  kilometre from the frontier.      13th.     He  was thereupon directed to  inform M. Pasitch that we were Foreign Office tourgently making substantial and definite offers of support and action Q^^f0&apos; o00&apos;to influence the attitude of Greece  and  R,oumania in order to secure Despatchedand facilitate the sending of  help to Serbia.                        11-20 A.M.     177. The hope of timely assistance  from Russia was  at thistime diminishing on intelligence of internal unrest.     Sir  G. Buchanan  reported &quot;  that  the  dismissal  of  Prince Petrograd,Scherbatov, lately Minister of  the  Interior,  and  of M. Samarin    1^^ct&quot; 12*had created the worst possible impression in  Russia.   The acting 5.30^ eRec8ive(iconsul-general considered that the effect produced by the dismissals io-45 A.M., 13th.had  so aggravated the position  that there was now no certaintythat there would not be strikes and disorders on a  large  scale evenbefore the end of the war.     Sir  G.  Buchanan in his telegram gives  the  reasons for  thedismissal of these two officials.     178. So urgent,  indeed, did the situation appear that we hadtaken the first step towards  restoring the Balkan  League withoutconsulting France.  Sir E. Grey  therefore now directed Lord Bertie Foreign Office toto explain  that the  situation  was  so critical and time so vital pg^&apos;2315&apos;that His Majesty-s Government felt they  must act  without con- No. 2377-&apos;Romesultatioh, but were  sure  that  the  action taken was  in  the sense No. 1838,&apos;Oct. 13.desired by the Allies, and thev  hoped it would be supported  bv Despatched-them.    &quot;                    &apos;                                 *  12-^0 p.M.

Erom  Italy  the prospects  of her coming into line werebrighter.     Sir B.  Rodd  was able to  say  the question  of  the rifles for Rome, No. 992,Russia  had been uracticaliy  settled,  but there  was  very little 0ct-13-ammunition to give.

In a further telegram he reported that  the Erench Ambassador Rome, No. 993,had  submitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the question of ^cr- 13-utilising the alternative  route  across Albania via,  Durazzo for the x^^M&quot;^communication  of  the  Allies   with  Serbia.  The  Minister  for Received 3-30 P.M.Foreign  Affairs  received  the   proposal  favourably,  provided itwould not imply any alteration in the political situation there.     In view of  this warning, that  the proposal touched  the normaljealousy  of Italy about the Adriatic littoral, Sir R. Rodd suggestedthat it might be of value to know  whether there was any truth inthe press reports regarding  an agreement said to  have  been con-cluded in July between Germany and Bulgaria, one of the terms ofwhich was stated to be permission to the latter to reach the Adriaticacross Albania.     180. The importance of Italy  taking  a firm line quickly wasemphasised by the uncertainty which M.  Delcasse&apos;s resignation hadproduced in the political situation in  France.

Lord Bertie reported that the  &quot;Temps&quot; had announced  thatevening that M.  Deieasse had  resigned on the pretext of ill-health,and that M. Viviani, who had for several days been in charge of theMinistry for Foreign Affairs, had now definitely taken over the port-folio of that Department.     A  few minutes  later he  added that the following passage hadappeared in the first edition of the &quot; Temps,&quot; but had been expungedby the censor from subsequent editions :         &quot; This morning  M.  Viviani received and communicated to his    colleagues a letter whereby M. Declasse tendered to him his resignation    on the ground of differences existing  between the Cabinet and himself    in regard to the conduct of  Foreign Affairs.  M. Viviani has shown, with    the  unanimous agreement of his colleagues, that these, differences had    never  appeared  in the Cabinet since, up  till  the 7th  October  last,    M. Declasse&quot; had taken part  in all the decisions of the Cabinet, and had    signed all the telegrams intended, as far as he was personally concerned,    to carry them into effect.        &quot; M. Viviani has therefore addressed a reply to M. Declasse in order    to recall these facts,  in order to establish the true facts of the situa-    tion.&quot;    181. The  situation in  Greece  was showing  no improvement.Whether or not they had got wind of our intention to  exert navalpressure on their food supply, M. Zaimis had been calling Sir F.Elliofs  attention to the danger of&apos; disease  and famine threatened bythe incursion of  Serbian  refugees,  who  were  crossing the Greekfrontier in  large numbers, and whom  humanity forbade the GreekGovernment to exclude, but whom they were unable to support.    Sir F. Elliot had seen M. Venizelos again, and he agreed withhim that the appeal to Greece to fulfil her engagements with Serbiawould probably  fall flat  unless  it  contained  a  definite  offer ofterritorial advantages,  and said  that as  soon as  the proposal  hadbeen communicated to the  Greek Government it must be published,in order that the voice  of the country  might be heard with regardto it, since parliamentary  government  had been suspended.   Sothat time should not be lost in overcoming Serbian objections tocession  of  territory, Sir F. Elliot  suggested  that  the  coast ofThrace  as  far  as Dedeagatch should  be offered  to  Greece, andsuch further acquisitions  as the result  of  the  war might renderpossible.         &apos;    M.  Venizelos was convinced that this would have a great effecton public opinion, which required to be strongly expressed  in orderto influence the  King, wdio puts  his  relations  with  the  GermanEmperor before the interests of his country.    Later  Sir F. Elliot had to add that, in the most favourableevent, the Greek Government would delay their  reply until they -knew Roumania&apos;s answer.OCTOBER 14.Petrograd,No. 1502, Oct. 13G.                   182. Roumania,  on  her part,  was  wraiting  for Russia.   SirDespatched           -Buchanan  reported  that  the  Minister for  Foreign  Affairs9-50 P.M. Received     stated that,  as  soon as Bulgaria  commenced active  military9-50 A.M., 14th.    operations  against Serbia, the Russian Government would have to               publish a  communique making their  own position clear.   They               would throw the whole  responsibility on the King of Bulgaria and               his Government, as distinguished from  the Bulgarian people.   The               next step would  probably be to make a naval  demonstration off               Varna  and  Bourgas,  to be  followed by a bombardment  of  their               forts.   M.  Sazonof was not,  however, in favour of  too precipitate               action.Nish, No. 448,Oct. 13.Despatched8-30 P.M. Received8-45 A.M.. 14th.    183. At Nish  M.  Pasitch wras  equally reserved.   Sir  C.  desGraz  reported that he had informed the  Prime Minister that wewere  urgently making  substantial and definite offers of support toinfluence the attitude of  Greece  and  Roumania.    M. Pasitch[1099-2]G
requested, that the details might be communicated to him in orderto understand the action which it was proposed to take.    184 A new and  unforeseen difficulty now arose  out  of  theAllied operations at Salonica.  Sir G.  Barclay  reported  that  the  Bucharest,Boumanian Government was complaining that goods traffic  on  the  No. 647 (sic),Salonica-Nish-Prahovo line had been suspended owing to militaryexigencies, and they hoped it could soon be resumed, for otherwise  1237 P.M.Boumania would be practically dependent for her requirements on  Receivedthe Central Enemy Powers, who in exchange would exact conditions  10-25 A.M.. 14th.damaging to our interests. .    Nor was he able to  report that our offer of military aid haddone much to clear the  air.  He had read to the Prime Minister  Bucharest,the Eoreign Office telegram (in which we were making  substantial  No.    Oct ^and definite offers of support.and action to interest the  attitude of  ReCeivedGreece and Boumania), and the Prime  Minister had only  replied  12-56 P.M., 14th.that he would  not give  an answer  till the  15th.   It  was  clear,however,  he felt  considerable  disappointment that  the forceoffered was not larger, and that it must take so long to arrive.  He hadobserved that under the most favourable circumstances if Boumaniaentered the war now she would have to fight unsupported for .atleast two months.    When it was  pointed out  to  him  that  the present was  afavourable opportunity,  since  the   Austro-German forces wereseriously committed in Serbia, he replied  that  Germany  had stillplenty of reserves with which  to attack  Boumania,   He also men-tioned that the proposed force would arrive at a moment whenmilitary operations would be rendered impossible owing  to  thewinter, and paid  little attention to the objections that fighting hadbeen in progress all through two recent winters.    He stated that the above must not be accepted as his answer,as he  must consult his military advisers.    Sir  G. Barclav added that in  the  opinion of the militarvattache the  military authorities  wrould probably  urge  as theirprincipal  objection the  impossibility of  replenishing  supplies ofammunition until the &quot;Dardanelles were forced.    185. Up to this  time no  declaration of war had  been madeagainst Bulgaria, although she had  commenced  hostilities  againstour ally.   Now, however, Sir  E. Grey  informed Paris, Petrograd,  Foreign Office toand  Borne that His Majesty&apos;s  Government  were prepared to  Paris, No. 2323;announce that a state of war  existed between  Great Britain  and  p^ro^radBulgaria as soon as the Allied Governments considered the moment  No^Igi;&apos;Oct 14opportune.  The  declaration should be made  simultaneously by the  Despatchedfour Powers.                                            &quot;         6 3o P.M.    If  Greece  and Boumania accepted our offer  the declarationshould be made at once.    In a supplementary  telegram to Petrograd we  further stated  Foreign Office tothat  we were  ready to  bombard Dedeagatch  whenever  Russia  Petrograd,operated against Varna  or  Bourgas.  We  proposed  at once to  n^f!L??n&apos;otdeclare a blockade of Dedeagatck.     (This telegram was repeated to Paris and Lord Bertie requestedto inform the Erench Government.)     186. But of the condition precedent of  Greece and Roumaniaaccepting our offer there was no sign.     Sir P. Elliot  reported   that nothing he  said  could  move  Athens, No. 1038,M. Zaimis from the position that the present  danger involved in a     13*departure  from  neutrality outweighed  the  eventual  disaster to  7.30^1Greece adumbrated by Sir E.  Grey in his telegram.                 Received 8P.M.     Roumania was equally disinclined to move, and at this point  ]4th-the Committee met again.
                                        39th Meeting.Minutes, Oct. 14.5 30 P.M.             187-  Since the last meeting the prospects of operating effectively              in the Balkan Peninsula had not improved.                   (a.) In view of the attitude of Greece the question of taking              the offensive from Enos was  raised, but the Admiralty opposed  it              on the  ground that it was unsuitable and would entail  a further              dispersion of our naval force.                   (6.) The  alternative  of  Dedeagatch  was  considered,  the              Admiralty wishing for a decision as to whether they should bombard              it or merely blockade the Bulgarian coast.  The advantages of a              bombardment were  the destruction  of railway  rolling-stock, the              destruction  of the port, the moral effect  as an  encouragement to              Serbia and the attraction of Bulgarian force away from the decisive              points.                   (c.) On the  General Staff stating that they would not require              the port and preferred to have it destroyed, the bombardment was              agreed to  in principle.   It was, however, thought inadmissible till              we had declared war, and for  this it  was  advisable to wait for              Russia&apos;s lead.  It was further desirable that the operation should              synchronise with a Russian bombardment  of Varna and  Bourgas,              and  these considerations seemed to outweigh the moral expediency              of prompt action.                   (d.) In view of the split in the Erench Cabinet on the whole              Serbian question, it  was also  specially  desirable  to  consult Paris.              As a first step it was agreed to inform the  Erench Government we              intended at once to establish a blockade with two  days&apos; grace.                   (e.) With regard to the command at Gallipoli, it was  decided,              after some discussion, to recall Sir Ian  Hamilton and  to  send out              General Monro  in his  place,  the  command to  be exercised by              General Birdwood  until he  arrived.    General Monro was to be              given no  instructions as to abandoning Gallipoli or pressing the              offensive  or  otherwise,  but was as a first step to  study the whole              situation and send home an appreciation with his proposed course              of action.                   (/.) Lord Kitchener explained that Sir J. Erench had been              asked to send off six divisions and two Indian divisions as soonl&apos;as              possible, and to request  General Joffre to take over the line held by              our two most southern divisions.                   (g.)  In so far as the  Near Eastern position was affected by              the  Mesopotamian expedition  the  outlook was encouraging.  Sir              John Nixon had reported  that he could take Bagdad at once with              his present  force, and  hold  it  for a month  till another division              reached him.                   (7i.) An interdepartmental committee appointed by the Cabinet              on the 4th  to  consider the  whole Mesopotamian  question had              reported  in  favour  of  this  course.    Lord  Kitchener,  however,              considered, on military  grounds, our best line  was  to occupy the              city, and retire after destroying  everything  of military value ; but              the Indian Government were of opinion that the place must not be              abandoned if  it were once occupied,  and  that no  serious forces              could be brought to bear upon Bagdad by the Turks.                   (i.) A  discussion consequently ensued whether  we were in  a              position to  hold the place  against  forces which   Turkey might              develop against it, and on the possibility of our being compelled as              a counter-move to  operate from Alexandretta in order to block the              road to Bagdad and Egypt.                   (j.) Lord Kitchener was of opinion that a week or two&apos;s delay              in sending  out  the  necessary orders  would not  prejudice our              prospects, as the Turks were too demoralised to act  quickly.  The              moral  importance of taking Bagdad as a  set-off to our lack of
success at  Gallipoli  was  generally  recognised.   Authoritativeopinion regarded  it as even  more  important than  Constantinopleitself.    (fe.) The conclusions were as follows :     (1.) Sir E. Grey  to inform Erance and Russia we were going           to blockade Bulgaria at once, and were ready to bombard           Dedeagateh as  soon as  Russia  operated against Varna           and Bourgas.    (2.) The  Admiralty to  declare the blockade  with  two days&apos;           grace.    (3.) Sir Ian Hamilton to be  recalled and  General  Monro to           replace  him, and to  report as  proposed in the  second           conclusion  of the last meeting.    (4.) General Staff,  in  consultation  with  the  War Staff, to           prepare  an  appreciation  of the present and prospective           situations in Mesopotamia and Syria(To be continued.)PRINTED AT THE EOBEIGN OFFICE BY O. B. HARBISON. 28/10/1915.
