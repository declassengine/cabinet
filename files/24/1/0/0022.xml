G.-22.COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Preparations for  a Winter  Campaign at the Dardanelles.Memorandum by the Secretary. J/2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,              September 22, 1915.
PREPARATIONS FOR  A  WINTER CAMPAIGN            AT  THE  DARDANELLES.   1. THE following progress report on the subject ofthe preparations for a winter campaign at the Dar-danelles has been  prepared to explain the  steps takenin accordance  with the  instructions given  by  theDardanelles Committee  at the meeting  held on  the31st August.   2. After receiving  the instructions of the Com-mittee I at once placed myself in communication withthe Admiralty and  War Office, and called on the headsof the  various Departments  concerned,  in order  toestablish the closest possible touch with all that is beingdone in this  direction.  It has been  arranged  that Ishall see copies  of all telegrams and letters  on thissubject, both in the Admiralty and War Office.            METEOROLOGICAL  CONDITIONS.   3. The first step to be taken  appeared to be  toobtain the best  possible information with regard to theprobable weather  during  the next six months at theDardanelles.   Sir  W. Napier  Shaw,  Director  of  theMeteorological Office, was approached on this subject,and he furnished a report  (O.I.D. Paper, G.-21), whichhas been circulated to the  members of the DardanellesCommittee, to the  heads  of all the  Departments  con-cerned,  and to  the Chief of the  General  Staff of theExpeditionary Eorce in the Mediterranean.   4i. The principal  results of this report are summedup in the following table	Oct.	Nov.	Dec.	Jan.	Feb.	Mar.	Apr.Mean temperature F. .. Mean daily minimum temperature Mean of absolute mini-mum of month F.

   In the above table the figures are given for  Kavala,which  appears to  be the station  most closely approxi-mating to the conditions  at the Dardanelles.  The onlyexceptions are the figures  for strong winds and  snow,which are given for Salonica, information under theseheads for Kavala  not being  available.  Prom this itwould appear that we have not very much to fear  in theway of rain before  November, but that we  are nowclose to the principal season of southerly winds,  whichprevail mainly in October, November, and December.    5. In discussing  the  question with a representativeof the Meteorological Office it transpired that a gooddeal could be done in the way of foretelling the approachof the weather, and more particularly of the  south-westerly gales, which  we  have most to fear, providedproper arrangements were made.   The representativesof the Meteorological Office  intimated that if  theirinformation was to be of value it was important to havea trained meteorologist on the spot, since military officershave no experience in this respect,  and would not be ina position to appreciate the value of  the informationgiven if it was in a technical form.   On the other hand,if it was not in a technical form the information wouldnot be of much value.  A trained meteorologist, however,would be able to interpret the information he obtainedfrom London and other sources in the light of his ownobservations and of  such local meteorological svstem ashe  had been able to work up.. They also pointed outthat meteorologists have been supplied to General Head-quarters  in  France  and  have rendered useful  services.The  War  Office,  therefore,  decided  to despatch  ameteorologist  to   the  Eastern   Mediterannean,  andDr, Wedderburn,  D.Sc, Edinburgh, has  been  selectedand is about to leave for the Mediterranean.    6.  It is hardly necessary to point out how valuablehis  services  may be if lie  is really able to give  even afew fhours&apos; warning of  the approach of bad weather.Lighters and tugs will be able to be withdrawn from theexposed beaches and berthed under shelter; the militaryofficers on the beaches will be able to remove exposedstores from  the neighbourhood of the beaches,  and tomake  things snug  at the piers; there may be time toclear the hospitals on the Peninsula ; .on the approach offine weather, arrangements will be made at the bases tofill up the small craft and push fresh supplies of storesover&apos;to the  Peninsula;  if cold weather is  anticipated,steps will be taken  to ensure  the distribution of lampsand oil.  Moreover, any offensive operations ought tobe  greatly helped if the weather can  be foretold withreasonable certainty.     7.  In addition to the despatch  of the meteorologist, steps have been taken to  obtain more  rapid receipt of Italian and other meteorological  information  in this country, which is the central British Intelligence Bureau for meteorological information.     8.  The  Admiralty have  already recommenced the practice,  which was abandoned when the fair weather set in,  of  transmitting meteorological  reports  to the Vice-Admiral.  It might appear at first sight that this would be sufficient  for  military purposes also.  On the whole, however,  it appears  desirable  that  the  Army should have their own meteorological  system, since the Vice-Admiral is constantly moving about, his staff  is not a large one, and there would not appear to he the
same certainty of securing the best information as if  aprofessional  meteorologist were  attached to GeneralHeadquarters.       SUPPLIES ON THE GALLIPOLI PENINSULA.   9. At the beginning of September the policy of theCommander-in-Ohief  of  the Mediterranean Expedi-tionary Eorce was to accumulate one month&apos;s  supplyin all  parts of  the Peninsula.  The object of this wasto meet the case of two long gales with only a shortinterval between.  It is stated locally that this happensoccasionally, and that the gales may last as long as tendays each, though this  hardly appears to be borne outby the statistics of the  Meteorological Office.  There isno doubt that when thirty  days&apos; supplies have  beenreached a higher standard will be adopted.   10. According to information dated the 8th Septem-ber,  1915,  the  number of  men and animals  on  theGallipoli Peninsula was as follows: 	Men.	Animals.Cape Helles Anzac ... Suvla ... ... ...	27,294 33,152 45,404:	6,400 2,300 4,200   On the  same  date  the supplies  accumulated forthese forces  were as follows : 	i Supplies.	Hay.	Grain.	Wood.Cape Helles Anzac Suvla	30 days 15 ,, 18 ,,	13 clays 5 n 6 ,,	13 days 8 ,,, .8 ,,	9 clays. 1 day. 5 days.   The heading &quot; Supplies &quot; includes  foodstuffs for theuse of  human beings; &quot;Hay&quot; and &quot;Grain&quot; refer toanimals, and &quot; Wood &quot; to fuel.   11.  As  regards  ordnance stoi*es,  there  were  thenten clays&apos; expenditure on the Peninsula, and  it is hopedto work up to twenty days.   12. In addition to the supplies accumulated on thePeninsula,  it is  understood that advanced  depdts  arebeing established at Kephalos  inside  the  pier, whichhas been lengthened.  The hope is  that, if the morebulky  stores  are  accumulated  in  sufficient  quantitieson the Peninsula, advantage may be taken of a lull ina gale, or a brief interval  between two gales, to pushin any  particular stores need for which may exist.   13.  At Helles, the standard  of one month&apos;s supplieshad  been reached  and maintained   for some weeks,though forage was  still in  arrear.   It is evident thatefforts  had been mainly concentrated on Suvla, Avherethe supplies for troops had  been  raised  from  ten toeighteen days&apos; stock  in one week.  At Anzac, however,supplies  for  the  troops  had  fallen  from  twenty  tofifteen  days&apos; stock since the 2nd September.   This wasascribed partly to two days&apos; bad Aveather, during whichlanding was  impossible, but mainly to  shortage  oflabour, which is  a  serious  difficulty.   It will be  seen
 that there was considerable shortage of fuel at Anzac and Suvla, but it is possible that this may have been due to the fact that the scrub with which  some  parts of the hills are covered can be used  as fuel.   It will also  be noticed that the supplies  of  fodder  are  everywhere rather insufficient.   There are ample supplies available locally, and it. is merely a question of getting reserves formed on  the  Peninsula,  which depends  upon  the weather, the available  supplies of small craft, lighters and motor-boats, piers, and  labour, both at the bases at Mudros and Kephalos and on the Peninsula.   14.  Since the above was written, telegraphic informa- tion, dated the 19th September, has been received in the Admiralty to the effect  that the position as regards supplies landed  in  the Peninsula is now more satis- factory than at any previous time, and it is hoped that two  months&apos; supplies may be  ashore by the  middle of October.    The  reserve  of  forage,  however, is  still unsatisfactory,  the amount  on shore  being  mainly a question of working parties and stowage.   The number of horses on theJPemnsuia  is being  reduced,  but even after the  reduction  the  amount of forage  landed  does not reach the standard laid down.                    SMALL CRAFT.   15.  There are now on the  station 9 water service vessels, 1  water lighter, 8 passenger ferry service vessels, 16 cargo ferry service vessels, 43 motor lighters of 150 tons capacity,  51 other lighters,  101 horse  boats, 3  scow- ended rafts, 82 cutters and flat-bottomed boats, 2 steam hoppers, 1 floating  crane, and 20 tugs, in addition  to 67 trawlers and 31 drifters.  Eight motor-driven lighters fitted  as  water-tanks  sailed  for  the  Mediterranean in the  second week in  September,  and  7  are  pre- paring to  go.  These ought to make the water transport situation  entirely satisfactory, even  if the rains have not by that time  rendered a great reduction in the imported  water  possible.  These lighters, however, are of course available  for  other purposes  besides  water. In addition to  the  43 motor lighters  of a capacity  of 150  tons  now in the  Mediterranean area, 28 motor- lighters of  equal capacity  are  being  prepared,  and when all  these  are completed a total of 71 will be available at the  Dardanelles.   The only  question on which doubt may be felt is as to the time within which they will  arrive.  They  have  to  be  towed  out  by colliers, and this is  apparently a very slow process. The value of these motor-lighters is  very great indeed, and all  the accounts irom the  Dardanelles bear  testi- mony to the extraordinary amount of work that they perform.  The  Admiralty have a very  large reserve beyond  those  allotted   to  the  Dardanelles,  so  that there  ought to be  sufficient to meet all eventualities. A further 30 are being sent to Devonport from the east coast  to be ready to  go out.   It is  perhaps worthy  of mention that, in order to supplement the naval provision of small craft, the Local Director of Works purchasedfour tugs to assist in landing  RE. stores, and he is also endeavouring, with the assistance of the Navy, to obtaintwenty-five  lighters  for  his  own work.  The  Vice-Admiral has telegraphed that the small craft supplied orpromised for the Dardanelles should be sufficient for allrequirements, including the supply of two new divisions,provided the whole force remains in the Peninsula.

G             ) &quot;l     MOTOR-BOATS.   16.  Motor-boats  are  required  mainly  for  thepurpose  of getting about in the  various  harbours.The  Headquarters  of  the  Naval Transport  Service,the  Local  Small  Craft   Transport  Service  (Naval),and  the  Military  Administrative  establishments,  arein the steamship &quot; Aragon,&quot;  at Mudros.  The  officerson hoard these ships have constant need  to be  movingabout the harbour  visiting transports or the differentestablishments  round the  harbour.  It must   be  re-membered that when a transport arrives she will verylikely be carrying stores for a great many branches, e.g.,supply  and  transport,   Royal  Engineers,  ordnance,medical, aerial,  &amp;c.   As the exact contents of each shipis not always known, officers representing all these andother branches will probably have to board the  ship  inorder to discover exactly what men or stores for theirbranch are on hoard, where they are to be found, andthey have then to make  arrangements for transhipmentinto  small craft to proceed  to their ultimate destination,either on the  Peninsula  or  on  one  of  the  islands.Similarly,  officers from the  establishments  on  shorehave to  visit the  transports to  obtain their  stores.Officers also often  have to  visit  outgoing ships :  forexample,  many  of  the   transports  are  convertedtemporarily into  hospital  carriers;  as  there  are noregular R.A.M.O. officers available for these, thev are incharge  of commissioned  civilian  doctors,  and  it isextremely  important for  a  11.A.M.0.  officer  to  visitevery one  and  see  that they have  their  proper com-plements of service stores and equipment on board beforetheir departure. . Eailure to  do this, in consequence ofthe lack of motor-boats,  has led to defects in the service.The  same  circumstances apply in a slightly less degreeat Kephalos,  which is an important advanced  base forthe  supply  of  Suvla, Anzac, and Helles, and at thedifferent beaches on the  Peninsula, numbering six in all.In addition,  in each of  the harbours the only rapidmeans of communication is by boat across the harbour.Eor  harbour work, omitting Arcachon boats, which it isunderstood are used as lighters, and four armed motor-boats used for  patrol work,  there appear to be nearlysixty motor-boats  available  for harbour work at theDardanelles, as well as  thirty-five steam pinnaces andthree picket boats.  Six additional motor-boats and onesteam pinnace  have  been approved  to go out.  Thissounds a very large  number, but it must be rememberedthat  owing to the inexperience of the chauffeurs and thelack of repairing facilities the wear and tear is very heavy,and  a considerable  number are always  temporarily outof action. The number required at Mudros is very largeindeed, as it is necessary to provide a considerable numberof regular ferry services, as well  as to  allot boats to anumber of senior officers to whom they are indispensable.Moreover,  the boats have  to be divided  between sevendistinct localities  (Mudros, Imbros,  Suvla, Anzac,  andthree beaches at Helles).   It is understood that Tenedoshas  now  been  abandoned.  When all  these facts aretaken into consideration the  number is certainly nonetoo large.                       HULKS.   17. Hulks have  not been demanded by the Vice-Admiral,  and consequently have  not been &quot;supplied by
 the Admiralty.  It should he noted that unless they can be supplied there  is bound to be a good deal of  steam- shipping locked up at Mudros and Kephalos.                   FLOATING DOCK.   18.  It  has not  been found possible to procure a floating dock to take destroyers.                        PIERS.   19.  At Mudros  the  position as  regards  piers is as follows:   In  Mudros  harbour there  are five piers capable of  taking picket-boats and lighters alongside drawing up to 6 ft. 6 in. of water.   In addition,  one deep-sea pier has  now been completed for vessels draw- ing 25 ft. of water.  This pier has been built by sinking a ship as a  T-head at  the  outer end of a  trestle-pier linking it up to the  shore.   The position of  this  pier is at Turk&apos;s Head, on the west side of Mudros  harbour, where  the  new  hospital camps and rest camps have been  provided.  Hospital ships are able to go alongside the  pier,  and this obviates the former  necessity  of transhipping  the  men  into  lighters  and from  the lighters to  the shore.   Moreover,  it is invaluable  for landing  men and stores of all  kinds, being  stoutly constructed.   It is in a sheltered position, and should be able to stand any gales.   20. At Imbros two  piers have  been built  at  the north-west corner  of the bay.  They are sheltered from the north-easterly winds by three ships  which have been  sunk  to form a  breakwater.  As is  mentioned elsewhere,  small advance ordnance and supply  depdts have  been  formed  in  connection with these piers, as embarkation can  be carried out there  at times when transhipment is impossible in Imbros harbour.   On the south side of Kephalos Bay there is also a small sand- bag pier, used for landing material  for  the  aerodrome and for General Headquarters.   21. At Helles (Lancashire landing)  one  breakwater and pier has been run out to 16  or 3.8 feet of water.  In addition there is a small  T-headed pier run into 13 feet of water.   Two ships have been  sunk to provide a  lee for these piers.  A small pier has also been constructed at Gully Beach, which is free from direct fire from the Asiatic  shore.  In addition there is a pier at V  Beach under the lee of the  sunken  ship &quot; River Clyde.&quot;   22. At Anzac there  are  two or three trestle piers running into 12 or 13 feet of wrater.  These will  not  be of any value in a south-westerly gale.   23. At  Suvla  three  very good temporary  floating piers were erected  on the north side of the bay after the original landing, and are still  in use.  They are quite sheltered for  landing during north-easterly winds and s;ales, but will  not be  of anv value  in westerlv winds. A. site has therefore been selected on  the southern side of the bay for a deep-sea pier, which will run due north from the second small spur on the  map at Lalla  Baba. It is hoped to protect this pier by sinking a couple of vessels on  the west and south-west, but there  is  no information that this has yet been done.   24. It is  not  anticipated that the sunken ships atHelles, Suvla, and Imbros will  remain in place during
heavy south-westerly gales without some support.  TheDirector of Works has therefore arranged to bring twolarge hydraulic  or suction dredgers from Egypt and topump sand from the floor of the sea into the vessels.  Ifthese  dredgers realise anticipations  it  will only be  amatter of  a  few nights&apos; work to fill the whole of thesunken vessels solid.   Of course,  the dredgers cannotwork by day  at Helles or Suvla owing to shell-fire.                      LABOUR.    25.  The greatest difficulty which exists at present inbuilding up a proper reserve of supplies  on the GallipoliPeninsula, is in respect to labour.  The Egyptian labour,which has  proved successful  on the  Islands,  has  beenfound absolutely  useless  on  the Peninsula, as  theEgyptians will not stand shell-fire.  The Greek labour,though not quite so bad as the Egyptian in this respect,has also proved rather unsatisfactory. A thousand men aredue from Malta shortly, but considerable doubt must befelt as to whether the  Maltese will stand shell-fire anv                                                   Vbetter than the  Greeks and Egyptians.   Two hundredmen of British Labour Corps were lost in the &quot; RoyalEdward,&quot; but have been replaced, and 500 labourers inall have been sent from the United Kingdom.    26. The War Office are negotiating with the IndianGovernment for  the  supply of 3,000 Indians, but  theyhave not been able to obtain the type  of man that wasoriginally asked for (Hazaras), and the Indian  Govern -ment can give no guarantee that the type they are ableto supply will stand shell-fire.   The War Office are alsoin communication  with the Colonial Office with a viewto the supply of Basutos  or  Zulus  for work on thePeninsula.   Chinese  labour has  been  considered, butrejected  for  the  present.   One  garrison  battalion  isnow on its way  to the Dardanelles, having been  sentprimarily for  fatigue duties.    27. In  the meantime,  the  General  Officers  Com-manding the  three corps are responsible for supplyingfatigue parties for  work on the  beach.  It jnust beremembered that nearly all the troops at the Dardanelleslost very heavily in  the fighting that  took  place inAugust, that there has been much sickness, and that thetroops are holding a very long line.   The result is thatthe men employed  on. fatigue parties, who come downfrom  the  trenches  for  the purpose,  are somewhatexhausted  and hardly lit  for the  labour and strain ofnight  work in disembarking lighters under shell-fire.To  this cause almost entirely must  be  attributed thefailure to build up larger stocks on the beaches.  As anemergency arrangement,   however,   men  have  beenlanded  from  the fleet to  assist the army, and  threebattleships have been practically  demobilised  for fiveweeks to find additional beach and transport parties.                       ROADS.    28.  A great  deal  has been done to provide roadsfrom the landing-places to the flat plain at the head ofSuvla Bay.   It  must be anticipated, however, that inwinter  this plain itself will  become more or less  amorass, and  probably impassable for  wheeled traffic.Tramways  will have to be mainly  relied on for internaldistribution.
                     TRAMWAYS.    29.  At the present moment there  are available at the  Dardanelles  a few  miles  of  Decauville  tramway, which has been laid from the  landing-places at Anzac, Suvla,  and  Helles, to  supply and transport  dumps. This, it is anticipated, will do away with a great deal of heavy manual labour.    30.  In addition, 40 miles of 2 ft. 6 in. gauge rail- way, 18 (two more will follow later) internal combustion locomotives, and 172 trucks (72 of 10  tons and 100 of 5 tons) have been sent out.   Sufficient workshops, spare parts, tools, &amp;c, have also been shipped.    31.  A railway  detachment has  accompanied, this material.    32.  In addition, a certain  amount  of  material is being obtained from Egypt.   .33.  It has been definitely decided to link Anzac by rail with Suvla, in order that supplies may be  sent from Suvla Bay when landing is impossible at Anzac.              AERIAL CABLE TRAMWAYS.    34.  Details of the local requirements  as regards aerial cable tramways  have only recently been received by telegram.  Orders have been given for  all the material demanded, but some weeks  must elapse  before it can arrive.   In the meantime transport  at Anzac  will have to continue as at present,  by means of mules and  handlabour.                     TRENCHES.   35.  Some hundreds   of  pumps  for  keeping  the trenches free from  water have  been  ordered.    Very large quantities of cement, loophole plates, shields, wire entanglements and wire  netting have been ordered, and the  greater part  has already been shipped.   The use wrhich will  be made of  this material  is, of  course, a matter entirely for local consideration. Twelve thousand trench boots  were shipped by the middle of September, and thirteen  thousand more will be despatched in time to arrive by  the middle  of October.   Sixty  thousand gallons  of whale oil are being sent to  provide against frost-bite.                      SHELTER.   36. The plan adopted locally as regards the  provision of shelter has been  to order the necessary material, to supply it to the various  bases, and to  hold  the army corps responsible for their own hutting  and the pro- tection of perishable stores.  At each of Suvla, Helles, and  Anzac there  is a chief  engineer,  C.B.E.&apos;s, and anumber of 11.E. companies, and  it has  been consideredthat  by  making the army corps responsible  for theirown  hutting arrangements and protection of stores muchgreater  progress will be  made  than if  the Director ofWorks attempted to carry out the work.   37. Very  large quantities of  corrugated iron (overhalf  a million sheets), timber, roofing felt (5,000 rolls)have  been ordered, and a good  deal has  already beenshipped.   In addition, all the  hutting timber and sheet-iron  procurable  in Egypt has  been purchased.   It isnot proposed  to build huts, except for hospital purposesand rest camrs on the islands,  but the dug-cuts  in wdiich    [1046]                                   D
 the troops live will be made as dry as possible by the means adopted.                      HEATING.     38.  Ten thousand oil stoves are being sent out for heating  purposes,  and braziers are being arranged for locally.  Oil fuel  and coke have also been sent out, and charcoal is being provided locally.                     CLOTHING.    39. Ample  supplies of warm  clothing  have  been arranged for;  1^5,000  waterproof  capes  have  been shipped  from  England.   Australia  and New Zealand are  sending sheepskin undercoats without  sleeves for their own army corps.&apos;                     CANTEENS.    40. One lot of canteen material arrived  about the middle of August, but was  immediately sold out.  A special officer of the Army Service Corps has  been sent out  to look after  this  question.  A  good  deal more canteen  stores are now on their way.   The intention is to  establish a  permanent canteen  at Imbros, where representatives of  units will repair in order to purchase what they require for their own units.  Local canteens will then be  set  up  as  required on the  Peninsula. Canteens have been established by local contractors at Mudros.   The Y.M.O.A. have started establishments at Mudros and Imbros, but this  is not at  present regarded as possible on the Peninsula.                    REST CAMPS.    41. In addition to the existing rest camp at Mudros, provision is being made  at  Imbros for  a rest  camp for 12,000 men.              MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS.    42. The difficulty which will arise  on the Peninsula when the clearing  stations  cannot  be evacuated daily is being grappled with.  Arrangements are being made to establish tented hospitals on the Peninsula well out in the open, under the  Geneva flag.  The sites selected will be those which cannot be used by troops  owing to their exposure  to  shell-fire, and will as far as  j)ossible be  immune  from  the risk of stray shells.  The Turks have hitherto respected the Geneva flag, and it is hoped that they will continue to  do so.   If this is found to. be the case,  the tents  may be superseded by huts.    43. Hutted  hospitals are  being provided  for 6,000 men at Mudros and 1,000 men at Imbros.  In addition, two convalescent  hospitals  are  being  established  at Mudros.                  WATER SUPPLY.    44. At Lemnos an elaborate system of water supply has  been installed  at Mudros West, where  the  newhospital  and rest camps are. situated,  and  is now inworking  order,  as  far  as  pumping  and  delivering a supply of water from ships to the shore goes.   A coni-plete system of tanks and distribution pipes  has beenprovided.  In  addition  a  250-ton condenser  has been erected there by the  Navy, and this was reported on the29th August to be due to come into operation by the
983rd September.  There are over sixty wells at MudrosWest.   45. At Imbros the water, supply is reported to be ina fairly satisfactory condition.  Up to the present  timea 6,000-ton vessel has been anchored close off the shoreat Imbros. which pumps water through a 3-inch floatingmain into  large  iron  reservoirs situated  on  the  pier.From these  reservoirs water-carts are filled.  Recently,however, a tank has  been built on a hilly part of thelanding, from  which  water is distributed to the campsby gravity.  The vessel  which  supplies this water, the&quot;Mercedes,&quot; is filled when necessary from one of twolarge vessels,  the &quot;  San Patricio,&quot; 14,000  tons, or the&quot; Sunic,&quot; a vessel originally built as  an oil tank, whichholds 16,000 tons, wdiich  make visits from Mudros toImbros   as   necessarv.    In  addition,  vessels   fromAlexandria  fill  their  salt-water  tanks,  after cleaningthem out, with fresh water, which is pumped from theirtanks into the &quot; Mercedes &quot; when they visit Imbros, theresult being that the latter vessel is always kept practi-cally full up.   Many wells have  been dug at Imbros,but the water from these  has hitherto been used mainlyfor cooking and not for drinking.   46. Imbros is also.the distributing centre of waterfor Helles and Anzac.   47. There  has   never been  very serious  anxietyabout water at Helles, as there has  always been  suffi-cient water  in the wells dug there to carry on  until thewinter rains  made it secure.  The only  difficulty hasbeen to supply wrater to  the men immediately on thebeach, which  has had to be done under shell-fire.   Theexisting water arrangements are reported to be adequatethere, though it  is  stated  that  the storage for thebeaches is on  rather  a small scale.    48. At the present time Anzac  is  still  dependentmainly on water brought in by sea.  The inconvenienceof this lies in the fact that the vessels vdtich bring thewater are exposed to shell-fire  and liable to be sunk ordamaged.   The situation has  now  improved,  as thepumping arrangements are in better working order. Onthe 29th August it was reported that there was a reserveof 75,000 gallons in  iron tanks, mainly supplied by theJNavy, at an elevation of 150 feet above  the sea.  Thisreserve, however, is only sufficient for forty-eight hours.    49.  Ample water has been found on  the  plain atSuvla, and the only difficulties arise in supplying Avaterat the beaches and on the ridge of hills running parallelto the sea from Suvla Point.  There are no reports as toany reservoirs having been established, but presumably,in case of emergency, water  could be sent by mules tothe landing-places, to the ridge  of hills mentioned above,and even to Anzac,    50.  Mr.  Beeby  Thompson,  a water  expert, hasarrived at the Dardanelles, and has every  hope that assoon as  the  boring  plant and pumps reach him fromhome ample  wrater  supply will  be obtained  from thedeep wells  to be sunk at  Imbros, Helles, Anzac, andSuvla.   The  material  he requires  had  to be orderedfrom America.  A portion has  already been sent and afurther portion  arrived  in  this country about the10th September.   It is understood that the latter hasalready been shipped.    51.  &quot;Until either  deep  wells  have been sunk, or rainhas fallen  in sufficient quantities to fill  the existing     [1046]                                    E
shallow wells  and springs, or adequate reservoirs havebeen built at Suvla and  Anzac, some anxiety must befelt regarding the water situation, particularly in viewof the danger from submarines during the voyage fromAlexandria to Mudros.   The position, however, shouldbe satisfactory when the  rains  set in.   This will con-siderablv relieve the responsibilities and anxieties of theNavy for bringing water to  Mudros  from Alexandria,and distributing it to the beaches, and should probablyrelease one large ship, as  well as several small vessels,used for distribution.                     REMARKS.    52. It is very difficult to judge here as to how farthe steps that  have been and are being  taken providefor the safe maintenance of the forces at the Dardanelles.In  the  absence of any opinion  to the contrary  fromthose responsible on  the spot it seems  safe to assumethat they are satisfied as  to the outlook, and they aloneare in a proper position to judge.  The fact that thestandard aimed at has already been reached at Helles, asregards supplies for troops, and the remarkable improve-ment in  the  accumulation  of  stores  at  Suvla arereassuring features, Avhile the slight falling off at Anzacis unsatisfactory.   Nevertheless, the Admiralty informa-tion referred to in paragraph 14 seems to indicate  asatisfactory  situation as  regards supplies.  So  far ascan be  judged at this distance the most disquietingfeature in the  situation is the water supply at  Anzac.Strong south-westerly winds  have already on one occa-sion interrupted  the landing of  supplies at Anzac fortwo  days, so that if  the storage of water there  reallyonly amounts to two days&apos; supply, it would look as theymust have  had an anxious moment.  Probably, though,in a great emergency, water could be sent up from Suvla.The difficulty  is that the  season of south-westerly windsmay precede the  season  of heavy rains, so that therewould appear to be  a possible period when  the watersupply at Anzac  may call  for  special measures.  It isonly reasonable to assume that this will be provided for.    53. Apart   from  the  water  transport   question,labour is undoubtedly by far the greatest  difficultyin regard to the accumulation of supplies with whichthose responsible have to contend,  and although allpossible  steps  have  been  taken, it is  a  difficultywhich  will not disappear for  some considerable time.The heavy fatigue duties on which a portion of the mennot actually required in the trenches are always engagedmilitate against proper rest, which is so essential to thewell-being of  the men, and is always difficult to obtainon ground exposed to shell fire.  The health and morale ofthe troops must inevitably be  bound  up, to a consider-able extent,  with this  question  of  labour.  In  thisconnection it would appear very unfortunate that aerialcable tramways were  not demanded earlier for Anzac,in order  to  obviate the tremendous fatigues  that havefallen  on the  troops there.   For, as pointed out byReuter&apos;s special service correspondent  in a  despatchdated the 4th  September, &quot; danger at this part of theline could come, I think,  only from physical  overstrainand from the bodily  weariness of the troops.&quot;    54. It would  seem that the provision for a wintercampaign was left rather late.  This was due to theconstant fighting that the troops have been engaged in
ever since they landed, to.the immense amount of workthrown on all the staffs by the arrival of large reinforce-ments  in  July as well as in the preparations for theAugust offensive  movement, and  perhaps, to  someextent, to the confidence  that existed beforehand in thesuccess of the  operation.   55. All demands sent  home: however, for material ofany kind  appear  to have been very promptly met, andnearly everything for winter should  be on the spotbefore the season  of wet and cold arrives.  The principalrisks are that  the enemy&apos;s submarines may sink  shipscontaining important  stores, and that if south-westerlywinds set in it may be impossible to get them landed onthe Peninsula  in  time.   In this connection it has to beborne in mind  that the materials  supplied for meetingwet and cold are  over and above  the normal food andammunition supplies, and will therefore make additionaldemands both  on  small craft and labour.  It is difficult,however, to suggest anything more that can be done atthis  end,  and  the solution  of these  difficulties  restsmainly with the men on the  spot.
