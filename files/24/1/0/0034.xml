G.-29.COMMITTEE  OP  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Preparations for  a Winter Campaign at the Dardanelles.Second Memorandum by the Secretary.(Previous Memorandum, G.-22.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,              October 23,1915.
PREPARATIONS EOR A WINTER CAMPAIGN            AT THE DARDANELLES.   1. THE  following  progress report, to  show thedevelopments which have occurred since the last reportdated the 22nd September, has been prepared for theinformation of the War Committee.   Detailed  comments on the  latter report  (G.-22)have  been received from officers at the Dardanelles,and  their  corrections  have  been  embodied  in thisMemorandum.   At the 32nd meeting of the War Committee, held onthe 24th September, 1915, the Secretary was directed tocall the attention of the  Admiralty and War Office tothe importance of  pushing on with the arrangementsfor the winter campaign in the Gallipoli Peninsula.Correspondence on this  subject is  printed  in theAppendix.   Erom  this it will  be seen  that the WarOffice expect to be able to meet all the requirementsmentioned in  the  previous report (G.-22),  with oneminor exception.               General Headquarters.   2. The General  Headquarters have been moved fromtheir exposed  position  on the  west side of KephalosBay to a more sheltered situation at the foot  of the hillsat the opposite side of the bay.              Meteorological Conditions.   3. The probable weather conditions  during the nextsix months were summarised in the last report.  Eorconvenience  of reference,  however, it  may be well torepeat them for November and December.  These are asfollows : -	November.	December.Mean temperature P. .. .. Mean daily minimum temperature Mean of absolute miuimum of month P... Days of snowfall Pain fall  Kavala .. .. London .. Mean rainy days Average number of days of strong winds. Maximum number of days of strong winds in any year  North South Maximum number of moderate and strong winds from the south in any year Maximum number of gales of over two days&apos; duration in any year	&apos; 52-7 4&apos;J-3 36-1 2-72-2-34 8 4-3 5 5 - 7 15	46-4 43 -2 33-4 3 23 2-20 9 3 4 3 7   4. Up to the end of September hardly any rain fell,except for one or two storms about the middle of themonth.  This is in accordance with expectations, and isfortunate, since the weather-proof material for trenches    [1132]
and  dug-outs  had not been landed  at the Peninsula,With hardly an exception, the  wind during Septemberwas  a  steady  blow from  the  north, with  consequentcalm weather  on the beaches.  From  the  27th to the29th September there was  a blow from the south, andthe  Vice-Admiral reports that  the  piers and otherarrangements  on the  beaches  stood  well;  traffic wasinterrupted, but  not  to the extent  anticipated.  Thenights.have been cold, and officers speak of requiringthree blankets  at night.    v   5. On the  night of the 8th-9th October a  suddensoutherly gale  arose which did  some damage to the piersand  lighters at Anzac and Suvla.  The Vice-Admiralreports, however, that he will be able to maintain duringthe winter the force now On the Peninsula with all unitsat full strength.         Supplies on the Gallipoli Peninsula.   6. The state  of progress as regards the accumula-tion  of supplies on the Peninsula may be gauged fromthe two following tables : UATION Strength on the Peninsula.	Men.

At Imbros there were  6,000 men and 250 animals,with 40 days&apos; supplies and 40 days&apos; forage. .   In Egypt there were nearly 27,000 men  and 33,722animals.                             -   The total ration strength, therefore, of the  Medi-terranean Expeditionary Eorce  (excluding Erench and7,000 Indians  on  the Peninsula) was 180,000 men and45,800 animals.&apos;  . 7. Erom the above it will be seen that as regards allessentials,, such as meat  and biscuits,  the  reserves  atCape  Helles  have  surpassed  the original 30 days&apos;standard, and this standard has been reached at Anzac
 and  Suvla.   As anticipated  in  the last  report, the standard to be aimed at has been raised and is now fixed at 42 days.   Considerable leeway still has to be made up as regards forage  and wood;  and hospital  reserve supplies on the Peninsula (but not on the station) are reported to be rather short.    8.  The principal  difficulties  in building  up the supply reserves are still those of labour and small craft, whicli will be discussed further on in this report.  Some idea  of the  magnitude of  the task of transporting, landing, and distributing the supplies for the army on the Peninsula may be gained from a recent expert calcula- tion, according to which for Anzac  and Suvla a daily tonnage of 120-130 tons has to be landed for supplies alone,  and ordnance and other stores raise this  to 150- 180 tons daily at the very least.  Although  the Turks can probably subsist on a far lower scale than our men, the calculation  is  also  suggestive  as  to  the enemy&apos;s difficulties, when  the perpetual harassment of his  coni- munications is taken into account.   One important item of1 information  recently received  is that Anzac  and Suvla are now both supplied mainly from ships lying inside  the net   at  Suvla  Bay (notwithstanding  the shelling) and not, as has been indicated, wholly  from Mudros and Kephalos.                      Canteens.    9. There is information that on the 23rd  Septemberthe canteen stores were coming along well, and by the 29th September  6,000 packages bad been sent up to Imbros, where the  big wholesale  canteen   has  been opened.  Brauches were to be  opened at the  various beaches in the second  week in October and supplies can already be obtained from Kephalos by units.                       Water.    10. The anxiety  regarding  water has not yet  beenwholly removed, as sufficient rain  has not yet fallen to affect the  situation  very  materially.   The position, however, has  materially improved,  and a full five days&apos; reserve  in tanks  over and  above what is procurable in each of  the areas  is probably by this time available.    11. At  Mudros the water  situation is  now satis-factory.    12. At  Imbros the position has always been fairly satisfactory, and the Navy liave commenced the erection of two  sets of distilling  plant which will ensure an ample supply of pure water in all circumstances.    13. At  Helles it is anticipated that the troops will very shortly be quite independent of sea-borne water. There is reported  to be  plenty of water about, reservoirs have been constructed,  and  the matter of distribution is in hand.    14. At Anzac the reserve in tanks is now reported to be 80,000 gallons,  as compared with 75,000 gallons in the last report.  Water is reported to be  scarce on Anzac&apos;s right flank,  but on the left flank there is a fair
supply.  A distilling plant is to be laid at the foot of acliff, in order to avoid the shelling.    15. At Suvla the water supply has turned out to berather a more difficult problem  than was indicated inthe last report.   There is reported to be a good deal ofwater in wells,  but distribution  is  a great  difficultyowing to  the constant  shell  fire.   At  present largequantities  of sea-borne  wrater are still being used atSuvla.  The erection of  a distilling plant is under con-sideration, but it is difficult  to find a spot free from fire.When the  rains come  these difficulties will cease andthere will be too much water at Suvla.  If the troopsat Suvla could only push on about 2 miles the waterquestion would  at once be solved, as it is reported thatthe whole of the area inland has an abundance.   16. Mr. Beeby Thompson&apos;s deep well-boring machinesleft London before the  end of September, and should bearriving by this time.                   Ordnance Stores.   17. Ordnance depdts have  been established at eachbeach;, but it  is not  possible in  case of Ordnance Storesto tabulate supplies  on a  daily scale.   At Helles  largeexcavations have been made for ammunition.                     Small Craft.   18. The auxiliary vessels and  small craft at  theDardanelles are shown in the following table : Type of Vessel.	Now at the Dardanelles.

J These twenty-two tugs have been sent out from England.  SomeOthers have been obtained locally, but are now nearly worn out.   There are also  a large number of  lighters, small craft, watertanks, &amp;c, obtained locally.    19.  There are still constant  complaints on the partof military officers as to the insufficiency of the numberof lighters and small craft.    20. The Vice-Admiral has recently asked for a smalladdition to the auxiliary craft to allow for a margin forthe winter, viz.,  three or four cargo carriers and  six or     [1132]                                      C
 eight  new  tugs.  Six  of the  former and eight of the latter have  been obtained, and are now on their way out.   He also reports that the number of motor lighters would be ample.                Motor and Steam Boats.    21. The  approximate number of motor boats  at Mudros is sixty, including twenty-six belonging to and maintained  by  the Army  (there  are believed to  be several other launches, motor  and steam,  obtained by the RE. Department and Director of Works,  but we have no information about them).    22.  There are  thirty-nine  picket  and other steam boats,  besides those lent by the Eleet,  and five more picket boats are now being sent out  to replace casualties.    23.  There is a srood deal of  evidence that the motor boat situation has improved, but it  is  almost impossible to have too  many of such craft, and  it is clear that the military officers are  not wholly satisfied.  All demands made by the Vice-Admiral for  motor  boats and steam pinnaces have, however, been satisfied by the Admiralty.                   Floating Dock.    21.  Vice-Admiral de  Robeck  has  applied  for  a floating dock or pontoon for  the  use of his  smaller vessels.  A  large  floating pontoon of suitable  type  is being sent from Aden.                    Depot Ships.   25.  It is the intention of the Admiralty to  replace both  the  &quot; Aragon&quot;  (the   staff  ship  at  Mudros) and  the  &quot; Minnetonka&quot; (the  Ordnance  Depot  ship at Mudros) when suitable vessels can be  found, and to release  the former vessels for  more useful transport work.   Some military officers would  prefer to transfer the whole of the administrative offices now on board the  &quot;Aragon&quot;  to a  camp  on  shore.  The difficulty is that the Principal Naval Transport Officer considers it essential to remain afloat in close touch with his work, and the Inspector-General of Communications  finds  it equally necessary to remain in close personal touch with the Principal Naval Transport Officer.                       Piers.   26. At Mudros  and Imbros  no  alteration  in the situation as  regards piers has been reported, though  a contract has been placed for the construction at Mudrosfor another  deep sea pier which will take two  vessels drawdng 34*  feet of  water,  but which  will  not befinished  until  the  end  of January.   At Helles the small  ships  which bring the  supplies  from  Mudros can now off-load direct on to  the pier, instead of havingto use  lighters  as at Anzac and Suvla.   27- For  the  supply  of  Anzac  two   new  trestle-piers have been constructed  at Walker&apos;s  Beach,   a quarter of a mile north of  Anzac  Cove.   These are &apos;immune from  shell-fire, and  work on  them proceedsthroughout the  day.    This  is  a new factor  of veryconsiderable  importance,  as  the.  old pier at  Anzac Cove is still under  fire  from the south,  and &quot;lighters
 can  only discharge to  it  in comparative  safety  a,t night.   The  new piers will remain free  from  shell- fire as long as Gape Suvla is in our  possession, and for this  reason Sir lan  Hamilton  has reported  that it is essential  to  retain  possession of  this point.  In  the southerly gale on the Sth-9th Octoher, hoth the piers at Anzac Cove were washed  away, hut the new piers at Walker&apos;s Beach  remained  safe.   A  wooden  sailing- vessel, full of timber and corrugated iron for  use  at Anzac, was recently sunk  by shell-fire, but fortunately settled down  in a position where  she protects, to some extent, the Walkers Beach piers, and a second ship is to be sunk to act as a breakwater for these piers.  Both. vessels will be filled with sand.    28. Excellent work  is reported to have been done at A Beach west,  on the  north side of Suvla  Bay.  A strong causeway has been run out about 80 to  100 yards along a ridge of rocks, and  a steamer has already been sunk as a breakwater.for the causeway.  Practically an enclosed harbour is thus formed.  The Naval authorities hope to  be able  to use lighters  in  it throughout the winter.    On the  south  side of Suyla Bay  a trestle-pier has been run out into 9 feet of water, just  north of Lala Baba.    Sir Ian Hamilton reported that in the gale  of the 8th-9th October the pier  head had been wrashed away and the  rails  displaced ; it is not quite clear fo which pier  this refers, but probably it is  that at  A Beach west mentioned  above.    29. It  has  been reported that  one of  the sand dredgers for filling sunken ships with sand has arrived, from Egypt, and  that the sunk vessels at Cape  Helles have already been filled.                                          ft                       Lai our.   80. Labour is  still the greatest difficulty in building up the reserve of  supplies on the  Gallipoli Peninsula, and  the recent epidemic of sickness among the troops has accentuated the difficulty.  The withdrawal of the t 10th Division  and  a  Erench   division  from  the Dardanelles to Salonica must; also have aggravated it.   31. Eight  hundred and fifty  Maltese Fere  sent to the Dardanelles  for  work  on the beaches,  but though useful at Mudros, it has  only been  found possible to send  a few volunteers to the Peninsula.  An effort is being made to increase the number of Greeks  at Cape Helles to 2,000,  and Egyptian volunteers are being tried again.   32. The garrison battalions are  employed mainly at Mudros at present, but detachments of such men as are certified to he  medically fit for the work are  sent up to assist at  the beaches.   The India  Coolie  Corps has, of course, not arrived yet, hut on the 29th September it was  reported  that a  labour,  company of 500  men had been sent to Suvla Bay,  200 for work  on  supply ships, 100 at the supply  dep6t, and  200 for duty on the beach under the Military Landing Officer.   33. An expert from  Egypt  has  been sent up  toorganise a Labour Bureau and to deal generally with the
-whole question with regard to organisation, recruiting,pay, and administrative treatment of labourers.                      Trenches.    34. It is understood that the trenches in the wetground at Suvla are  to  be organised on a somewhatdifferent system, redoubts at intervals taking the  placeof the continuous line of trenches.    35. No information is as yet to hand as to whetherit has been found possible to revet the trenches, whichin  summer, both at Anzac and  Gape  Helles,  wereunrevetted. If the Turks are still short of sand-bags, asthey were in August, we ought to possess a considerableadvantage in this respect in winter.  The shipment ofall the necessaries for  reducing, as  far  as possible, thediscomfort of the trenches in winter continues.                       Shelter.    36. It is understood that not much  has yet  beendone on the Peninsula towards the  provision of shelterin the dug-outs, the limiting factor being the transportof  the  necessary materials from  the  bases  to thePeninsula  and their landing.  As already mentioned,one ship containing material of this nature was sunk byshell fire off Anzac.  According to information, dated the29th  September, the matter is  receiving very  carefulattention.                   Warm Clothing.    37. There was a sudden cold snap at the  end ofSeptember, which created a  demand  for warm clothing.    By telegram, dated the 6th October, from the G.O.C.this demand has been met.                       Baths.   38. The Corps Commanders at Anzac and Helles aremaking arrangements  on shore  as regards bathing forthe troops in  winter, and a large quantity of heatingapparatus will be provided for the purpose.  The possi-bility of bath-ships in Suvla Bay is being  consideredlocally.                       Roads.    39. No fresh information is available since the lastreport, except that  a stone  crusher  has been  sent toSuvla Bay to assist in preparing  roads for the winter.                     Transport.   40. During  the  continuance  of the dry weather ithas been found possible to employ mechanical transporton the Peninsula over short distances, and the followingvehicles have been utilised: 	Lorries.	Ambulances.	Oars.At Mudros ,, Imbros Suvla .,, Elelles .. ,, Anzac Total ..	35 1 10 1	12 6 16 4	5 - 3 ...	47	38	oo
    41. It is hoped that even in wet weather, by the use of non-skid chains, it will be possible  occasionally to employ them.   It is proposed to use motor lorries to ply between Anzac and Suvla in case of necessity.  There are also 5,524 mules and 2,249 carts on the Peninsula.                      Tramways.    42. Beyond short  lengths of Decauville tramway, laid  from  the  piers to the  depdts  and  some of  the beaches,  there  is  no  information available  as to  the laying of  tramways.   The materials  for the  more ambitious projects  should be available  locally by this time,  but their shipment to the beaches and landing must be a matter of considerable difficulty.  The.project for building a railway between Suvla and Anzac  has now  been abandoned.  It would involve the landing of 1,200 tons  of stores at Anzac,  and,  in  view of other pressing needs  and the improved position as regards reserves of supplies, the  two corps  commanders con- cerned were opposed to its construction.                Aerial Gable  Tramways.    43. Materials for these have been  shipped  since  the date  of  the last report,  being despatched  direct  to Mudros instead of to Alexandria.                     Best Camps.    44. According to information, dated  the 10th Sep- tember, it has been decided to give up establishing the proposed rest camp at Imbros and to  place it instead at Mudros.   A good deal is being done to provide for the comfort  and recreation of the troops  in the rest camps. Iinbros is not a favourable spot in the  winter, owing to the  exposure of  the bay to the prevalent north-east winds. Books and magazines  have  arrived and  are being distributed to the troops.                      Aircraft.    45. One of the small airships has  made a  trial trip successfully. The whole of the material for the Tenedos aerodrome has now been moved up to Kephalos.   Our aircraft have operated with considerable  success.   The Gallipoli flour-mills are said to  have  been shelled and broken up.   The shipping in the Straits  is being very carefully watched, and so harassed that it is reported to have almost deserted the area  below Nagara by day. A good deal of night-work has been  carried out, and bombs dropped  on beach  parties, supply  centres, and shipping.                   Anti-Aircraft,   46. The  enemy&apos;s aeroplanes have  been reinforced and have been active, having made at  least one raid  on general headquarters at Kephalos, where they killed one man and wounded some others.   47. An anti-aircraft section (two 13-pr. guns mounted on motor lorries)  has  been  sent  out, and should   be arriving  about now.   The Navy also have a certainnumber of anti-aircraft guns mounted on  board ship.    [1132]                                   D
                   Surveying Ship.   48. A fully-equipped surveying ship has been sentout in accordance with the express request of the Vice-Admiral Commanding; the ship, in addition to its  fullstaff of surveying officers, carries a complete lithographicplant and staff for the immediate  production  of  chartsand plans.   In addition to her ordinary surveying work, the shipwill be of great assistance in fixing by triangulation theexact position of enemy batteries  and in carrying lLoutobservations to facilitate indirect gunfire.                   Hospital Ships.   49. A good deal of anxiety has been felt locally asto the sufficiency of the number of  hospital ships, andan increase has been asked for on  the ground that thereis no  margin of safety.  The position was not regardedas satisfactory even  for the normal rate of sick  andwounded during  the period of  comparative quiet.  Ifoffensive operations are resumed it is considered locallythat a considerable increase will be  essential.   Moreover,if the rate of  sickness is not reduced before really badweather sets  in, many who are  now  treated withoutleaving their units  will have to be sent to hospital andevacuated from the Peninsula,  owing  to the lack  ofshelter there.   On  the   6th  October  the War Office  asked theAdmiralty for twenty more hospital ships.  The equiva-lent of this demand has been met  by the fitting out offive large liners with a carrying capacity of about 500each, and of the &quot; Mauretania &quot; and  &quot; Britannic,&quot; whichwill each accommodate about 6,000 cases.  All theseships are fitted and have left, except the &quot; Britannic,&quot;which will not be ready for two months.                      Hospitals.   50. The hospital for 1,000  beds at Imbros, referredto in  the last report, will not be provided.   There willonly  be a  small  hospital  there with 100  beds.   Theimpossibility of increasing the hospital accommodationon the Peninsula owing to  lack of  space continues tocause anxiety in view of the near approach of  spells ofbad weather, when  for days together evacuation of thehospitals may become impossible,  and great  congestionmay be caused, even from sickness alone, to say nothingof a serious  engagement.                       Health.    51.  The health  of the troops is a matter of the mostserious preoccupation.   52. The statistics  of  preventible diseases  w-eek  bywreek are as follows :-	Sum Total of Oases up to September 4.	Week ended September 24.	Week ended September 29.	Week ended October 6.	Week ended October 13.Enteric lever Dysentery Sinall-pox Typhus	1,568 : 2,352 6 ^ 1	350 1,015	164 864	396 916	251 543
    Surgeon-General Bab tie reports that on  bacterio-logical examination more than half the cases reported asenteric  are found  to  be   dysentery, but  only  about40  per  cent,  of cases are so examined.  If cases  notnot examined bacteriologically are in the same propor-tion the proper number of cases would be 1,470.    On  the 21st October the  number  of  sick  andwounded of the Mediterranean Expeditionary  Eorce inMediterranean hospitals amounted  to 991 officers and39,791 other ranks.  This shows a  decrease  comparedwith the previous return (dated the 20th October),  whichreads  1,000 officers and 41,001  other ranks.   Thesefigures do not include men on passage in hospital shipsand carriers.    53. Dysentery   and  diarrhoea  are  the  principaldiseases which affect the troops, and in addition  to themen reported in hospital a very large proportion of thetroops are affected.  In September it was  reported that78  per  cent,  of the troops at  Anzac  had occasionalattacks of diarrhoea, but not enough to place  them onthe sick list.   It is reported that if  the men can beput on &quot; soft  food&quot; for a day or  two they generallyrecover, but if they continue to live on their ordinaryrations they eventually get seriously ill, and have to beremoved.   This, of course, complicates  the  supplyquestion, arrowroot, sago,  cornflour, &amp;c, having  to besupplied out of all proportion to any previous estimate.    54. There  seems little room  for  doubt  that  thesickness and general debility of the troops is due verylargely to their prolonged  stay in the trenches.   This isshown by  the immediate  improvement in  the healthof divisions withdrawn to the rest  camps on the islands.The withdrawal of one  British and one  Erench divisionto Salonica can hardly  fail to aggravate this very seriousdifficulty,  as it will make the relief of the troops in thetrenches less frequent than ever.    55. Even if the  cold weather  eventually stops thedysentery it is feared that owing to the general  debilityof the troops  other diseases,  such  as  bronchitis  andpneumonia, will probably increase.  It  must be re-,)membered  that  even  in  Egypt the Australian troopssuffered a good deal from these diseases.    56. Erom  the  health   point of  view the  outlookwould appear  to be very  grave unless reinforcementsand drafts  are supplied in  sufficient numbers to enablethe troops to be relieved more frequently than at present.

I am. &amp;c.                                               M. P. A. HANKEY, Secretary.                                      (B.)121/Mediterranean/361.   (C. 1.)(Secret.)Sir,                                  War Office, London, S.W., October 15, 1915.    With reference  to  your  Secret  Memorandum G. 22  on &quot;Preparations for aWinter  Campaign in  the Dardanelles,&quot;  dated the 22nd September, 1915, I  amcommanded by the Army Council to acquaint you, for the information of the PrimeMinister and the Dardanelles Committee of the Cabinet, that they expect to he  ableto meet all the requirements mentioned  in the memorandum, with the one minorexception  mentioned below, in so far as  the War Office  is concerned  with theirprovision.    Moreover, as any  detailed estimate of  requirements depends largely  on localconditions, they  have obtained from General Sir Ian Hamilton an assurance, datedthe 9th September, that he has arranged for everything needed to secure the comfortand safety of the troops  in the Dardanelles during the winter on the basis of theirexisting strength.    These assurances are of  course dependent on the provision of sufficient smallcraft for the purposes of landing supplies and stores, a matter which is referred to inparagraph 15 of  your memorandum quoted above.    Some difficulty  has  arisen in  meeting the requirements  of  sheepskin coats,mentioned in  paragraph  89 of the memorandum,  the  New Zealand Governmenthaving found it impossible  to  make any  supply from that  country; but it isanticipated that supplies will be available from  this  country before the severeweather sets in.                                                          I am, &amp;c.                                                             R. H.
