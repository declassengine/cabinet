November 1915.SECRET.G-26 (e).PRECIS   OE  DOCUMENTS   AND  PROCEEDINGS  CON-    NECTED  WITH  THE POLITICAL  AND  MILITARY    DEVELOPMENTS   IN  THE  BALKAN  PENINSULA,    OCTOBER 25-30,  1915.[In continuation of O.I.D. Paper G-26 (d).]                                         41st Meeting.Minutes, Oct. 25,       251. The question before the meeting was how far we should3 p.m.           meet the pressing demands of the Erench for further assistance in               Serbia, in view of-                   (1.) Our own information that the cause of Serbia was lost.                   (2.) The possible political effects of a refusal.                   (a.) Lord Kitchener submitted  that the  Erench  Government               misunderstood the  actual situation.  He  had received a strongly               worded note urging that  our troops should be sent direct to Salonica               and not to Egypt, as had  been arranged.   He had handed to the               military attache the following reply  : Foreign Office to       &quot; It is evident that the French Minister of War does not understand theParis, No. 2410,   situation as regards our troops under orders to embark at&apos; Marseilles for theOct. 25, 7 p.m.    East and their destination.                   &quot; Only one battalion has embarked so far, whilst two divisions are con^               eentrating at Marseilles for embarkation.  Twenty-nine of our best transports,               including all s^iips capable of conveying horses, are engaged moving French               cavalry divisions, French infantry divisions, and, in addition, 42,000 tons  of               stores.  The remaining ships are few, and cannot be fitted for transport and               horses.                   &quot; The capacity of  the port of Salonica  is very limited; in consequence,               the clearance of French troops and stores will take a considerable time. -                   &quot; Our troops arriving there without transport  and horses,  while the               French are fully using the port for disembarkation, will cause  confusion, and               be useless when disembarked until provided with their necessary equipment.               The military movement direct to Salonica will cause more delay than if the               troops were properly equipped at Alexandria.                   &quot; The War Office Staff therefore consider that there will be delay in  their               preparation to take the field, and strongly deprecate the French proposed               movement as militarily unsound.&quot;                   (b.) Doubts  were expressed as to whether General Joffre&apos;s               approval of the enterprise was  not due  rather  to political  than               military considerations, and this  doubt Sir John  French, who  was               present, confirmed.                    (c.)  Admiral Jackson said  the naval view  was against the               operation, as involving another  line of communication, which was               difficult to defend.                   (d.) As against falling in with the French view, it was pointed               out that, after full  consideration, they had formally agreed to our               troops going to  Egypt,  and within three days had gone back on               their  agreement.  Though there was a  complete answer to  any                   [1099-5]                                            B
charge that we were  deserting them, it was felt that the obviousobjections to making the facts public were very great.     (e.) In excuse for the new French attitude, it was generallyadmitted that the situation had changed materially since the agree-ment was  made, and  that now  it was a question of  saving  theFrench rather than the Serbians, for whom there was no longer anyhope.  Nor could the original object now be attained, since alreadythe  communications  with Turkey by w7ay  of  the  Danube  werepractically in German hands.  The  only means  of  stopping thesupply of munitions to Turkey were operations, as suggested by ourrepresentatives at Athens and Bucharest, against the railway fromKavalla, or the action of Bussian troops through Boumania, whichwas contingent on our supplying  them with rifles, and could, there-fore, not develop in any case  for several months.     (/.)  It being  agreed that the  operation now proposed by theFrench was strategically bad, the question was how we could refuseto co-operate without a disturbance of cordial relations.  As the bestsolution, a frank conference between the French and British militaryauthorities  was suggested.   It was further proposed that, as theproblem turned so much on the factor of sea-transport, naval repre-sentatives should be added, and this was agreed to.     (g.)  It was then pointed out that  the  actual  problem ofthe Balkans was complicated by the  necessity we might  be underfor operating elsewhere in the Near and Middle East,  and  thisconsideration raised the question of how  many troops could safelybe withdrawn from the western front.     (h.)  Lord  Kitchener  reminded  the  meeting that they  hadalready decided to withdraw six British  divisions and two Indiandivisions.   Two of  the former had already  been taken out of theline.   He  asked for an immediate  decision,  otherwise  the  WarOffice could not carry on.     (i.)  Sir John French emphatically protested against any ofthese  divisions being  removed  from  his command.   He  gavereasons for his opinion that  without all of them he could not beresponsible for holding the line; but his reasons were not foundconvincing by the Committee.   They therefore felt  unable  to goback on their previous decision in  face of the fact that  LordKitchener  and the Geueral Staff adhered to their opinion that thetroops could be spared from France.     (j.) The only question that remained  was whether  Sir JohnErench (who had left the meeting)  should be informed at once thatthe  decision to transfer eight divisions was to be adhered  to, orwhether it would be  better  to  wait till the result of the proposedconference with General Joffre was known.     (IG)- The question was put to the vote and the decision was toinform Sir John Erench at once.     The conclusions then were :-  -     (1.)  That Sir  John  French and  General Murray, with officersof the General Staff  conversant  with the military situation in theNear East, and representatives of the Admiralty should confer wdthGeneral J off re and representatives of  the Erench General Staff andMinistry  of Marine  on  the  expediency  of the proposed Serbiancampaign.     (2.) Sir John  Erench to  be informed  that four divisions ofBritish troops  (in addition  to the two  British divisions alreadyunder orders  for  Marseilles  and two Indian divisions) were to bedisengaged from the line in Erance for service in the East.     252.  Steps to  nurse the possibility of Roumanian interventioncontinued.  From Bucharest had  come a report^said to  emanatefrom certain  leading  men in Roumania belonging  chiefly to theOpposition, that if Roumania  sanctioned the passage of Russiantroops through her territory her neutrality would be compromised
Foreign Officeto Bucharest,No. 598, Oct. 25,D. 7 p.m.and she would have to join the Entente, and that M. Bratiano mighthe persuaded to commit the country definitely, provided the Russianforce was not less than 150,000.  Sir G. Barclay was now informedthat Lord Kitchener wished to know if the military attache couldconfirm the truth of this report.Bucharest,No. 676, Oct. 25,D. 10-12 p.m.,R.

The prospects in this  quarter  were improved by eventswhich had occurred in Bucharest,  The same evening Sir G. Barclayreported that a big  demonstration,  Avhich had been widely adver-tised, had taken place the  previous day in Bucharest.  It had beenpromoted by the &quot;Unionist Federation,&quot; a recently formed coalitionof the followers of M.  Filipescu and M. Take Jonescu in order toforce the Governments hand.     Patriotic speeches  were delivered  by these two leaders andothers, and a motion was passed calling on the  Government tomobilise and enter the field forthwith, so  as to prevent the  CentralPowers from joining hands with Bulgaria, which  would be fatal,not only to the legitimate aspirations of Ptoumania,  but also to hervery existence.     After the  meeting  great  crowds  assembled  and came  intoconflict with the  troops  and police, and in the  evening  hostiledemonstrations were made before the clubs of the Minister of War,Bratiano,  and Marghiloman, the windows being broken.   Part ofthe  premises of  one  of  the   German-owned  newspapers  weredestroyed.     Serious as the demonstration appeared to be as an indication ofRoumanian national feeling, Sir G.  Barclay stated later on that thePrime 1VJ inister seemed to  take it very lightly.     254.  W^ith  regard  to  the  Russian part  in the design, Sir E.Grey&apos;s suggestion that the Roumanian Government should not beapproached on the subject of the passage of Russian troops throughMoldavia  until they were  ready to move  did not  find  favour.M. Sazonof objected  that  the  course proposed would involve theloss of valuable time,^and  stated that he had already instructed theRussian Minister to sound the Roumanian  Government  on thematter.  The instructions sent to the Russian Minister were asfollows:     &quot; M. Sazonof has instructed the Russian Minister at Bucharest to expressto the Roumanian Prime Minister the sincere satisfaction of the  ImperialGovernment at the recent declaration made by the Roumanian Minister ofWar respecting the desire of the  Roumanian Government for  militaryco-operation with the Allies.    &quot;The Imperial Government is proceeding actively with measures for therealisation of this plan.  Echelons of Russian  troops have been sent in thedirection of Odessa, and  the Government is employing all its efforts toprocure munitions which it requires to enable them to pass to the offensive.In the circumstances the  Russian Minister is now authorised discreetly tosound the Roumanian Prime Minister with regard to the passage of Russiantroops through Roumanian territory.&quot;     In this demarche we had  no   choice  but  to acquiesce,  butSir G. Buchanan was directed to make it  quite clear to the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs that His Majesty&apos;s Government  considered thatRussian troops should not pass through Roumanian territory with-out an arrangement with the Roumanian Government.    255. At the  same  time France was  doing all she- could tostrengthen Russia&apos;s hand for the new departure.    Lord Granville reported that since the receipt of the news thatthe Emperor of Russia had undertaken to send 200,000 troops byRoumania, the French  Government  quite acquiesced in droppingthe Archangel project.
     Paris  was also urging the  Russian  Government to arm theforce with their own rifles, replacing those taken by French rifles asthey arrived;  80,000 Prench rifles had started  five days previously,and the remaining 126,000 would be sent as soon as the cases wereready; 416 cartridges per rifle were being furnished.     2 6. At Athens Sir P. Elliot had not yet lost hope of Greece.He had informed M. Zaimis  that though  the  offer of Cyprus had Athens,absolutely  lapsed, this need  not prevent the  Greek  Government No. 1112, Oct. 25,from offering  their assistance  and submitting  their demands, and R&quot; 0ct;  P^&quot;&apos;asked him whether the resistance which Serbia was making did io-20 a.m.&apos;not show that Greece&apos;s opportunity had  come.     M. Zaimis said  that  Greece was  beset  bv dangers  on allsides, and  he  seemed  to  be  obsessed  with  the vision of  hugeGerman reserves behind the  army attacking the Serbians.   Sir E.Elliot stated he could  only see  one danger, namely, the  massacreof  the  Greek populations  in  Turkey  should; the Turks  andGermans prove victorious.     257. Still  the Greek  Government  did not  cease  to  makedifficulties  over the presence  of our  troops.  The  Greek  GeneralOfficer Commanding had refused to allow British troops to camp Athens, No. 1117,just inside the frontier, but was willing to give every facility to Oct. 26, D. 4 p.m.,camp just outside.                                                12-35Ct&apos;m7&apos;     The Erench  General Officer Commanding had telegraphed to     p&apos;m&quot;say that the Greek  troops were  themselves going to camp at thefrontier near Doiran.     The view  of  the   Greek  Government was  that the facilitiespromised for passage of troops  did not imply the right of settlementin  Greek  territory, and  they suggested that some arrangementshould be  come to which should guide  officers on both sides and -avoid friction.     Sir F. Elliot had previously  suggested that the King might beflattered if he  were invited  to visit the British camps at Salohica,and this proposal was approved by the Foreign Office.  He seemedinclined to accept the invitation, but  Sir  F.  Elliot had  now toreport that the King had abandoned the idea on medical advice.    Athens, No, 1118,                                                                 Oct. 26,                                                                 1). 8-40 p.m.,     258. The third string to our bow was the project  of  detaching E. Oct. 27,the Arabs from the Turkish cause, and upon this Sir H. McMahon 9*45 a.m.reported that he had that day sent a reply to the Sherif of Mecca.    Cairo, No. 644,     He stated that the districts of Mersina  and Alexandretta  and Oct. 26,portions of Syria west of the  districts of Damascus, Horns, Hama, ^ g^j? p&apos;^&quot;&apos;and  Aleppo  (that is,  the Mediterranean littoral),  could not be  &apos;     P&apos;m*regarded as purely Arab, and  should  be excluded from the areaproposed by him.     He added that -with  the above  modifications   and  withoutprejudice  to  existing engagements with Arab  chiefs  we acceptedthose boundaries, while, as regards the territories therein in whichGreat Britain was free to act without  detriment to the interests ofErance, he gave the following assurances :-    &quot; Great Britain will (1) vrithin the above limits recognise and supportthe independence of the Arabs, (2)  guarantee the Holy  Places againstaggression, (3) advise and assist the Arabs in the  establishment of the mostsuitable form of government when the proper time comes, it being understoodthat the Arabs  desire that the advisers  and officials  required should beBritish.    &quot; The Arabs on their part will recognise that the position and interestsof Great Britain necessitate special  measures of administrative control inthe vilayets of Bagdad and Basra.&quot;     Sir H. McMahon expressed the hope that this declaration wouldremove all possible doubt as  to the  sympathy of Great Britaintowards Arab  aspirations,  and lead to a  firm and abiding alliance,
               the immediate result of which would he the expulsion of Turks from               Arab countries.                   He now proposed to communicate the above terms  to  Earoki               and  Aziz-el-Masri,  and   facilitate  their  commencement   of               propaganda.                   The greatest possible secrecy was being maintained regarding               our direct correspondence with  the Sherif, since recent  reports               showed his life to be in some danger.Paris, No. 802,        259. At this point the progress of affairs was  disturbed by aOct. 26, D. 10 a.m., Ministerial crisis in  France.   Lord Granville  reported that  theR. 12-45 p.m.     Minister of War had resigned, and two hours later that the CabinetOcti826NO* 803&apos;    cr*s*s ^d come to  a bea(^&apos;  an(*          ^ouncn 0^ Ministers wasD. 11-50 a.m.,     then sitting to take  a definite decision.R. 2 p.m.                                         OCTOBER 27.                   260. With regard  to Eoumania, it became  clearer  every  day               that her attitude would turn on the amount of force  the Allies               developed in her vicinity.  The violent demonstration  promoted by               the &quot;Unionist  Federation&quot;  on  the 24th  was  followed  by  theBucharest,       Opposition leaders, MM. Take Jonesco and Filipesco, being receivedOctober 26,       in audience by  the King on the 26th.  His Majesty was believedj^jj^Q1&apos; m       to have  assured them  that he would not be an obstacle  to  theR*. Oct. 27^&quot;&apos;      country&apos;s aspirations, and that his own aspirations wrere those of               Eoumania.  He pointed out, however, the great risk that  lloumania               would run if she entered the field before 400,000 troops were ready               to co-operate with her.                   261. No immediate action  was, therefore, to be expected, and               the news from Serbia was growing worse.11-25 a.m.            Sir C. des Graz reported by wireless  (the only  means of com-Kralievo, No. 465, municationmow open) that the military situation was most serious.vi1ai^ome,Oc\9t27&apos; Severe fighting  was  taking place on  the northern front,  and greatD.2-20p.m.,  &quot;  &apos; pressure  was being exerted by the  enemy in  the  Valley of  theR. 3-50 p.m.&apos;      Mlava.                   The Bulgarian attack  along  the whole  eastern  front was.               described  as  furious  and  the   Serbians  were  retiring.  Serbian               Government stated  that, if effected speedily, a Russian  landing               would have a great  moral effect in  Bulgaria as  politicians  in that               country were being  proceeded against rigorously.Kralievo, No. 477      He also sent word that the Prime Minister  was most anxious^Rome^^  that                   communication between Serbia and Salonica should be restoredD. 2-5 p.m.  &apos;  &apos; as s0011 as possible, for  otherwise  there would soon be shortage ofR. 3-50 p.m.       food, and  disaster would ensue.   The Prime Minister was confident               that the Serbians could hold the Germans if the army  in the south               was set free, and said that comparatively little effort was  needed to               make the Bulgarians retire at present.General Staff          262. This view  was  certainly  too  sanguine.  The  day  theappreciation,      message was received the Bulgarians captured Zajecar and Kujazevac,Oct. 30.          an(j ^nug  seri0-QSiy endangered the retreat  of the  1st  and  3rd               Serbian Armies operating in the north.  The Austro-German and               Bulgarian armies were also in touch across the Kvaina district.                   263. Our power of redressing matters still depended in a great               measure upon Greece, and efforts to bring her into line continued.               Paris  was specially anxious that the  loan  should go  on, and SirForeign Office to   jj.  Grey now gave notice that in deference to the  views  of  theNo. 2506 -&apos; Paris   French Government we proposed to  continue making  advances onNo. 2436; Athens,  behalf of ourselves  and Russia to the Greek  Government up toNo. 955, Oct. 27.   15,000,000  fr.  The French  Government  were  doing the same.               Only 5,000,000 fr.  had  so  far been  advanced by His Majesty&apos;s               Government.                   [.1099-5]                                            C
     264. At this moment the indications of Greek intentions wereunfavourable.   It was  found that  all  Greek money  was  beingwithdrawn from  London, and  Sir 17. Elliot was  asked if it was Foreign Office topossible that Greece might turn round and demand the internment q^6^&apos; ^0&apos;7956&apos;of the Allied troops, and  provoke a  rupture with  the Allies under   *   &apos;  *  p&apos;m&quot;pressure from Germany.     265. Sir E. Elliots own  impression was quite in the opposite Athens, No. 1121,direction; M. Venizelos had just told him that the General Staff ^CT- 27&apos;D- 5 P-m.,appeared now to be convinced that  Greece ought to join in  the  &apos;  45 p&apos;m&apos;war against Bulgaria and  would  shortly do so.   The German bogeyhad no longer any terrors.     But M. Venizelos added that he hoped all the  Allies, including Athens, No. 1122,Italy and Bussia, would hasten to the assistance of Serbia,   Italian    27&apos; D- 5 V-mvtroops at Salonica would  pass more  or less unnoticed  among the  &apos;  p&apos;m&apos;others, but if the rumour was correct that the Italians  were aboutto try to  pass by  Santi Quaranta a general outcry would certainlybe raised.                         42nd  Meeting.     266.  The only question before  the  Committee  was  how  to Minutes, Oct. 27,provide Bussia with sufficient rifles to enable her to make the move 6-15 p.m.,which would decide the conduct  of Boumania.     There were available 200,000 Erench  rifles and 300,000 Vetterlirifles, but for the latter Italy could only provide 8,000,000  rounds,and  therefore  no more than a small proportion of them could  beregarded as effective.     It was suggested in their place we might send 130,000 Japaneserifles and ] 70,000 British rifles, which were immediately availablewith their  ammunition, and  with the 200,000 Erench rifles wouldmake up the desired half-million.     Lord Kitchener objected that the adoption of the suggestionwould prejudice home defence.   Against  this it was urged  that, inview of the actual naval and military  situation, the risk  entailed  bya temporary retention of the rifles at home was very small comparedwith results that must flow from the immediate  strengthening ofthe Bussian offensive power.  But Lord  Kitchener felt  still unableto take the responsibility of the proposed  course, and he  regarded itas equally unsafe to take the rifles from troops in Erance.     An alternative course was to send 150,000 Japanese rifles and150,000 Vetterli to Bussia, and  ourselves to retain the balance of150,000 Vetterli rifles.   Lord Kitchener  thought  even  this wouldbe a mistake, and it was therefore decided to Consult General  Knoxand the Bussian mission who were now on their way home but hadnot yet sailed.     The  conclusion was that Lord Kitchener  was to consult theRussian  Government .and their  representatives on  arrival  as  towhether,  having  regard to the ammunition available, they wouldprefer 150,000 Japanese rifles in lieu of  half  the 300,000 Vetterlirifles.     267. Owing  to  the  interruption of the  ordinary  lines  ofcommunication the situation in  Serbia was far from clear, and itwas further obscured by the possible intervention of the Albanians.     Erom  Monastir our vice-consul, Mr. Greig, reported that the Monastir, No. 14,local  authorities  were without  any  news from  northern  Serbia. Oct. 27,They feared a  Bulgarian advance from IJskub to  Tetova (between ^ Ji^JJjJEskub and the  Albanian frontier), which they  believed  to   beinadequately guarded.  The success of this movement would  bringthe Bulgarians  into contact with the Albanians, who hate theSerbians.  It would also jeopardise all  the  principal lines   ofcommunication  between Serbia and the Adriatic, and  would  placethe whole of Serbian Macedonia at the mercy of the enemy.     Large  quantities of flour were  being sent from Monastir  to
               Central Albania to-which the local authorities would retire in  case               of need.                   Troops of the neighbouring district were in constant readiness               for action.                   Mr. Greig added that  be understood that the Greek military               authorities at Fiorina (20 miles south of Monastir) expected orders               to  occupy  the  Monastir district  if  it  was  threatened  by  the               Bulgarians.                   If British  or  French  troops  were to be sent  there, it  was               important that they should arrive in time to take up the pick of the               strong positions in the mountain country north of Monastir.                   The same evening he was informed by the officer commanding               at Monastir that the  Bulgarian  advance had begun from UskubR.

It wras thought that  the Bulgarian               force threatening Tetova did not exceed one division.Monastir, No. 16,D. 9 p.m.,Athens, No.Oct. 27,D. 9-10 p.ra.R. Oct. 28,10-10 a.m.          26S. Mr. Greig&apos;s information that the Serbians  still had hope1123, of Greek intervention was confirmed  by Sir  F. Elliot.   He sent     word that the Serbian Minister&apos;? view was that Greece would  wait     until  Bulgaria  was  fully  occupied  elsewhere, and  would  then     attempt  to  effect an easy  conquest  of Thrace  as a side issue     independent of the general war.   This would  also have  the effect     of relieving pressure on Serbia. The Serbian Minister, nevertheless,.     believed that the tendency towards war had spread to the General     Staff.Paris, No. 814,Oct. 28,D. 12-3 a.m.,R. 10-15 a.m.Rome, No. 1061,Oct. 29.Petrograd,No. 1587, Oct. 27,D. 9-24 p.m.,R.

As to the moment for Bussian action  with Boumania, Lord Granville reported that the French  Government agreed with our view that the Russian troops should not pass through Boumania &quot; without  an  arrangement  with  the Roumanian Government.&quot; Their idea was that, when the Russian  troops were concentrated and actually ready, the R-ussian Government  would probably ask Roumania to join, and would  say :  &quot; We  have got to get these troops to Bulgaria ; of course, you do not mind their passing.&quot;     The &quot;arrangement&quot;  might *be similar to that  with  Greece, with a formal protest.     Italy added her concurrence with our view, and as it wras also shared by the Russian  Minister  at Bucharest, it  was accepted at Petrograd.     Sir G. Buchanan had been  officiallv informed that the Russian Minister at Bucharest had suggested it would be better to w7ait till the Russian  troops had concentrated  at  Bessarabia before  asking for their passage  through Roumania, so as not to compromise the success of the negotiations.     M.  Sazonof  had   therefore  decided to  say  nothing  to  the Roumanian Government at present.     Sir G. Barclay reported in  the  same sense,  saying that  the Russian  Minister deprecated requesting  the Roumanian Govern- ment to  consent to  the passage of  Russian  troops through Roumanian territory at present.    It  was clear to him that the Roumanian  Government  would not  consent until  Prussia was ready.     He had reminded his  Government that he  had been informed by  several  Cabinet Ministers that if  Russia placed on the frontier 300,000 troops ready to take  the field, it  would be impossible  for the Prime Minister any longer  to postpone Roumanians entry intothe war.                         OCTOBER, 28.    270. By the evening of the 27th  he  was able  to throw  freshlight  on the  actual situation  at  Bucharest and  sent  home thefollowing telegram for the information of Lord Kitchener : 
     The Prime  Minister,  he understood,  was supported  hy the General Staff in his present  policy of inaction because there was strong opposition in military circles to any operations south of the Danube.     General  Staff,  however,  were most anxious to intervene.  If instead  of discussing  the passage of  Russian  troops through Roumanian   territory  (which in  his  Opinion would be  always resisted) the Russian General  Staff  increased  their  forces in Bukovina by 150,000 men and  at  the same time guaranteed the arrival  daily of  a train-load of  ammunition  on the  Roumanian frontier, the influence of the General Staff would, he was convinced, be exerted in our favour, and anyhow there would be a basis for a military convention.     He  thought, therefore, that  the Entente Powers  should deal with the Bulgarian question themselves and utilise the Roumanian army for offensive operations in Transylvania in combination with a Russian force of  at least 150,000 operating from Bukovina.     He  had  been informed  from a trustworthy source that the German military attache  at Bucharest  had recently stated that at German  head-quarcers the   Balkans  were considered  the most important theatre of operations, and this statement was confirmed by reports to the effect that reinforcements were being sent to the Danube  Valley which would bring the total of hostile forces  in that direction up to about 500,000.     271. The most  serious danger now was  that  Serbia  might succumb before anything could be done to help her, but such news as  was coming through was  encouraging.  Sir R. Rodd reported Rome, No. 1054, that the  Russian  Ambassador had heard by wireless from Kralievo ^CgJ^&apos; that the  Serbian Government had not yet (27th) left Nish,  but ^ 9.40 p&apos;^&apos; expected to do so on the 29th.  The spirit of the Serbian army was admirable, though  the troops were exhausted with continuous fighting.  The Bulgarians, on the  other hand, were fighting without any enthusiasm.  The Prime Minister said that if Serbia were over- run, and had to submit to  the  fate of Belgium, he felt this must be endured  and she must not make peace.     272. This was confirmed  by  Sir G. des Graz from  Kralievo. Kralievo, No. 481, The Prime Minister had told  him that morning that he was aware of the peace rumours, and  the Government had given orders to con- jjt n p.^&apos;&apos; tradict them.  He knew that  the King of Montenegro had spoken to his entourage of the desirability of peace, but the Montenegrin Government  had not put the question to his  Government.   He concluded with the  following words: &quot;As long as my Government is at the  helm, there can be no question of peace, for Serbia  would have the same fate as Belgium.&quot;  The  Government and  the army were at one in this.    Sir C. des Graz added that of course there was the possibility that Parliament it might be of  other politicians, say the Liberal party  might, make peace if the Prime Minister resigned.    273. The reference to Montenegro was explained by a telegram Cettinje, No. 157, from Count de Salis  which was delayed in transmission.  It  stated ^g26&apos;^&quot; ^ct&apos;29&apos; that after a Council held at the Palace on the 26th the chief  of the     p&apos; party opposed to the present Minister was sounded as to his attitude, should peace  now  be  concluded  with  Austria.   The  Serbian Minister  was pressed at the same time to urge his Government that their best course was to make peace.    The  Austrians  had recently  advanced  to Vishegrad, and as far as  we could ascertain the  Montenegrins retired before them without fighting.    274. In these circumstances prompt action  by the Allies was Petrograd,more than ever necessary,  and Sir G. Buchanan  reported that  the  pO&apos;9.4590&apos;r^ct&apos; 28&apos;Prench Ambassador had that morning received a telegram from his  R\ io-50Pp.m.

In the meantime Russia had not been idle.  The delayeddemonstration on the Bulgarian coast had taken place.     Sir G. Buchanan reported that the Black Sea fleet had returnedto Sevastopol on  the  previous day after bombarding Varna  onthe 26th.     The enemy made an  unsuccessful submarine attack.     The  Russian squadron of four battleships, two cruisers,  andfourteen destroyers suffered no casualties.     276.  The news  from Greece was not unfavourable.  ColonelNapier, on  the morning  of the  28th  had had an interview  withM. Venizelos, at which he said that he had hopes that when the Greekarmy were concentrated  in  the  Salonica district the pressure ofpublic opinion would be such that Greece would join us.  It would,however,  probably be necessary for the Entente to put the questionto the Greek Government at  a certain moment whether  they werefor or against.     If he  came  into power he  felt  sure we should again  offerCyprus, and he  hoped also  the  Bulgarian littoral,  in return forGreek action.  The Bulgarian littoral  was of immense importanceto Greece in  the  event of any future war with Bulgaria owing tothe efficiency of modern submarines.   If Bulgaria were to continueto possess any base in the iEgean Sea, she could effectively interrupta Greek mobilisation.     He foresaw the  entry of Roumania if Russia  could furnish200,000 men, the defeat of Bulgaria, the capture of Constantinopleby the march of Greek and Allied troops through  the Bulgarianlittoral to Constantinople.     He was  quite convinced of the ultimate  defeat of Germany,though the action of Bulgaria would delay it.Foreign Office toAthens, No. 962,Oct. 29,D. 12-5 p.m.    277. By this time information  had  come  in that  GeneralMahon&apos;s troops had crossed the frontier, and Sir F. Elliot wasdirected to see that there was a clear understanding that the Britishforce would be free to keep its communications open with Salonica,and to return, if necessary, through Greek territory.               bBerne, No. 749,Oct. 29,D. 11-10 a.m.,R. 3-20 p.m.     278. It now began to appear that Germany was getting anxiousabout Boumania.     Mr. Grant-Huff reported that the  following  information wasfrom the military attache :-    &quot;I learn from an official source at Berne, generally very well informedon Balkan questions and  in touch with officials in Berlin, that  GermanGovernment have offered a loan to Roumania on condition she joins CentralPowers and marches on Bessarabia.  Offer is accompanied by a guaranteeof Germany to secure Roumania now and in future in possession  of terri-tories wrested by force from Russia.  Same source says Germany is appre-hensive that Russia should  counteract these  offers by voluntary cession ofBessarabia to Roumania.   My informant added, nothing short of such avoluntary cession would prevent Roumania from accepting German proposal.Above  has  been communicated to Russian Minister at Berne, who  hasinformed Petrograd  by telegraph,  adding  that should combination  ofGermany and Roumania  be effected, original German  plan of extendingmilitary operations to Odessa and Black Sea,  a project which could only berealised with military support of Roumania, will be carried out.   PersonallyI agree with this view entirely.  &apos;     &quot;French military attache has received  reports from his secret agentsthat German Emperor has had many interviews with Roumanian Minister inBerlin, and is actively pushing negotiations for co-operation of Roumania.&quot;     [1099-5]                                            D
1,0    279. Meanwhile the staff conference which had been orderedat the last meeting had taken place at Chantiliy, but without therepresentatives of the two  countries being  able  to come to anyagreement about the Balkan campaign.  General Joffre. therefore,came over to put the French case before the British  Government,and in his absence the French Cabinet crisis came to a head.    Lord Granville reported that the Viviani Ministry had resigned Paris, No. 826,and M. Briand had been  charged with the formation of  a new 2ct;2?.&apos;   , .  ,                       0                                 D. 6&quot;15 p.m.,Cabinet.                                                         R.8-io.P.m.  .    280. The  re-establishment of communications with the Serbianarmy had become a matter of  urgent importance, and Italy wassounded as to  whether anything could be done from her side.    Sir R.  Rodd was informed that the capture of the Salonica Foreign Office toRailway rendered the revictuailing of the Serbian army a matter of OctTIV^0&apos;1981&apos;urgent importance if their eventual capitulation was to be prevented, n. 9-15&apos;p.m.The only possible alternative for  the transport of supplies wouldappear to be by the Adriatic.    Since the Adriatic was in  the Italian sphere of operations itwould first be necessary to ensure the acceptance by the ItalianGovernment of naval responsibility in the matter.  No  French norBritish flotillas could be spared for convoy purposes in.the Adriatic,and facilities for transit must therefore be undertaken by the Italiannavy.    Sir R. Rodd was directed to represent the urgency  of thesituation to the Italian Government, and to invite them to under-take this operation.                          OCTOBER 30.     281. There was still hope that, if supplies could be got through, Bucharest,the Serbian army might be saved.   In reporting the  dispositions of No- 688(0ct- 28&apos;the Bulgarian army as  furnished  by our military attache, Sir G. ^&apos; oct^bBarclay said the total killed and wounded was estimated at 20,000.  9.45 a.m. &apos;     The German military attache had admitted to a  Roumanianofficer that the  offensive  against Serbia  was progressing  slowlyowing to bad weather.  Ammunition destined for Constantinoplewould be sent from Sistova to Rustchuk  via Gabrova, the railwaysto and from Sophia being kept  open for troop movements.     The bombardment of  Varna had  produced a  good effect inBucharest, as  hitherto the General Staff did not believe in a Russianoffensive againt Bulgaria.     There  were  persistent  rumours  of a Greek-Bulgarian under-standing.     He also reported that  the  military attache had learnt that the Bucharest, No.Germans commenced clearing mines at the Iron Gates that morning. 691, Oct. 29,It Avas estimated that  at  least fifteen days would  be required to S&apos;  nafl     iiii      1                       *               ^        R.  Oct. 30,complete the  work.                                              9.30 a,m.                          43n2 Meeting.     282. Sir  A. Murray reported that at the joint conference with Minutes, Oct. 30, General Joffre and the French  General Staff at Chantilly, our Staff 10-30 a-m- representations as  to the  technical objections to the French  pro- posals had not  had the  smallest effect.   The only idea of the French was to support their divisions already landed at Salonica, without any regard to the  difficulties involved.     Since the conference, General  Joffre&apos;s plan had  been made clearer.   He had come to London on the 2.9th and explained  how he believed that the Serbian army could  be  saved and its communi- cations  reopened.   At his suggestion the  Serbians had sent two divisions south to attack the force which had cut the railway, and there was a fair  chance  of the  Allies acting  effectively in co-operation  with this movement.      With this view our  General Staff could not agree, as they regarded the Serbian communications as cut beyond redemption.
         General Joffre, however, pointed out that our refusal to act     with them  would  probably have most serious consequences, not     only for his own  position, but also for the stability of the allianceused  itself.   As  he had urged  at the Downing Street conference the,ffre-  previous  day,  the expedition was  regarded as  of the  highest     importance.  If its object could be achieved, the  Central Powers     would be placed in a most embarrassing position, for either they     would have to retire with great loss of prestige or they would  have     to maintain a  large army in Serbia.   The Serbian army was well     supplied with Prench munitions for some time, and if it  fell back     to  the mountains and  had its communications  secured by the     Allies  within certain limits which he laid down, it would remain     intact and formidable.         In view of this representation, Lord Kitchener proposed to the     Committee  that  the  reply  should  be  that, although neither  our     Admiralty nor our War Office could accept the Prench calculations     as to the capacity of the port of Salonica or the railways into Serbia,     we were prepared  to co-operate within the  limits they desired:     That is, &quot;to secure the position from Salonica to Krivolak inclusive,     &quot;in order  to  support the  Prench army,  which has the duty of     &quot; protecting the railway between  Krivolak and  Veles, and  of     &quot; ensuring  communication with the Serbian army,  such operations     &quot; not  to  be conducted  beyond the line Monastir-Uskub-Istip-     &quot; Salonica, and solely for the purpose of maintaining communication     &quot; with the  Serbian army), and with the full understanding that if     &quot; communication  with the Serbian army cannot  be opened and     &quot; maintained the whole Allied forces will be withdrawn to be used     &quot; as circumstances require.&quot;         After some discussion it was agreed, seeing how far the Prench     had committed themselves  and having regard to  General Joffre&apos;s     statement, we could not refuse to co-operate within the above limits,     leaving our hands free to go further, according to circumstances.         Sir  E.  Grey, however, considered that we  should  put it  on     record for the future that we must not be rushed into these military     operations without proper consultation.         The conclusions were           (1.) That the  Cabinet  should be advised to sanction a reply     being  sent  to  General Joffre in the  terms  of Lord Kitchener&apos;s     draft.         (2.) Sir E. Grey to place on record with the Erench Ambassador     that in future the British  Government will not be wdlline; to con-     sider proposals for military operations which have not  first been     discussed by the General Staffs of the two countries.         283. The additional information on which the  Cabinet had to     take their decision was as follows:  17,      The news from Monastir was better.   Mr. Grieg reported that     he was informed that the Bulgarian advance towards Tetova hadL a.m. no^ developed,  and that the  Bulgarian  position  at TJskub was   &apos; threatened  by Serbian troops via Katchanik and Gylan.         The Greek Prefect and Commandant at Elorina, which he had     visited that day, were convinced that Greek troops would occupy     Monastir &quot;if Greek sphere of influence is  threatened,&quot; and they     stated that the  Bulgarian  Government had  been  warned in that   .  sense.  They said 50,000 Greek troops of the 2nd Army Corps were     concentrated between Ekshisou and  Vertecop.  There were live     battalions at Elorina,  where  all ranks  appeared to sympathise     strongly with the Entente.         284 With regard to Boumania, nothing seemed now to stand     in the way of  Eussia&apos;s taking the  required action except the want     of rifles.[1099-5]E
ij    Sir G. Buchanan reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs Petrograd, fully appreciated the importance of concentrating troops without    1602&apos; ^ct* 29&apos; -delay.near the Roumanian&apos;frontier, as there was1 always a danger r&apos;oct so0&quot;&apos; of  Roumania,  under German  pressure, siding  with  our enemies. io-25 p.m. Russia could not, however, weaken &quot;her - front, and risk the loss bf Riga and Dvinsk, the consequences of which might be very serious. It was i most important that France !and Great Britain should send rifles and ammunition in  sufficient1 quantities.   Several army corps were being directed towards  Bessarabia,  but  Sir  G.  Buchanan understood  they were far below their normal  strength  and very deficient in rifles.     285.  Asa means of keeping Roumania in  hand,  Sir G. Barclay Foreign Office to was informed  that  we intended  to  continue,  in concert with the Bucharest, French, sending considerable forces with as little delay as possible p0j^S 0ct&apos; 30, to Salonica in order to support Serbia, and was  directed, in view of   &apos;     p,In&apos; rumours to the contrary, to let M. Bratiano know this.     286.   At Athens the attitude of the Government  seemed to be Athens, No. 1142, improving.   Sir F. Elliot reported  that  the   Greek Minister of Jc^0&apos; Communications had promised railway facilities for supplying our R* 3.35 J^1&quot;&apos; troops in Serbia.                M     The French Minister had the previous day received an assurance from the King  that permission to pass into Serbia implied permission to return.  ,          /    !   ------     He  also  forwarded the following information  from Colonel Athens, No. 1144, Sir Thomas Cunninsrhame :- .                                   Oct. 30,                                                              -  D. 8-30 p.m.,     The view  of the General Staff was that Greece would retain her R- 11,30p.m. neutrality until forced to  intervene by the development of affairs. It w;as, however, a fact  that the question of Greece interfering independently  was being  closely discussed.  The idea was to  save the face  of the King by the  fiction  that for Greece to  attack Bulgaria for her own interests Avas not the  same  as to assist the Allies against  Germany.   When  Bulgaria  was occupied elsewhere, Greece might take the opportunity of falling suddenly on her.  ..  The chances; of  the neutrality of Greece being   compromised were growing greater daily and would continue to  do so as more troops were sent.     Sir Thomas Cunninghame was of the opinion that the hope of Greek co-operation should not be abandoned, and that if troops were hurried to Salonica the present views of the Government would not long be maintained.     286.  At the same time Sir F. Elliot reported that the French Athens, No. 1146, Minister had had audience with the King  the  previous  day.  His Oct. 30, Majesty again  expressed his firm intention to  maintain neutrality ^ Oct%Pomi&apos;  m until the last.  The  German Emperor had  guaranteed the integrity  &apos;   &apos;   &apos;  ^&apos;m&apos; of  Greece (his colleagues understood until the end  of the war). When everyone  was exhausted after the  war  the opportunity of Greece might  come. The utmost the  Allies could  hope for  was stalemate.            .,   ;        : &apos;/  &apos;  ; The King said that the stories in circulation, such as that he might turn  against the Allies, disgusted  him.   He  was honestly afraid of the German army on the one hand, and the Allied fleets on the other.     In a later telegram he expressed a hope that the reports  which Athens, No. 1149, were current in Athens, that all exports from England and Egypt Oct. 30, for Greece had been stopped, were untrue.   He  should regard the S&apos; f.39rtp&quot;m*&apos;   ,.    j,      .    . i , .                 -,.  ,       rr\ 1   j &apos;  n      Ik ll&quot;O0 D.m. policy of coercion at this moment as most disastrous.   The tendency there was towards action ;  what was wanted was the presence of our troops in Macedonia, which would enable  the   King&apos;s hand to be forced.  Pressure might then be useful, but at present it would only indispose our best friends towards us.
Paris No. 829,         287. In Serbia it seems nothing but a little hope was neededOct. 30,         for their resistance to continue.D. 5*30 p.m.,          Jjord Granville reported that the Serbian Minister had calledR. 10*10 p.m.     ^         ^0 urge ^-ne necessity of sending more troops to  help              Serbia.  The Serbian Prime Minister had  telegraphed  declaring              that  the Serbian army could hold out for a month, provided  they              received immediate encouragement by the proof that British as well              as Prench troops were coming.                   The Serbian  Minister stated that  the  Germans had   been              working to  impress  on  the Serbians that  if  they  gave in and              aUowed the junction of  the Germans with  the Bulgarians  they              would not  suffer, and  that though the  Crown Prince and the              Government were quite  unmoved  by such intrigues, there  were              certain officers who were impressed, and that a pro-German nucleus              was  forming round Bogetchevitch,  the  late Charge&quot;  d&apos;Affaires, at              Berlin and Cairo.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OWICE BT C.
