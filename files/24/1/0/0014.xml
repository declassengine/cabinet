NOTE BY  THE  SECRETARY.   THE following notes with regard to Alexandrettaand the Gulf of  Tskanderun relate entirely to questionsof fact.  The  information  in  the various  reports, onwhich  these notes  are  mainly based, and  which arementioned in the last paragraph, has been checked andbrought up  to date, as far as possible, by reference topersons who have recently visited the locality.                            M. P. A. HANKEY.   March 17, 1915.ALEXANDRETTA  (ISKANDERUN).               GULF OP ISKANDERTJN.    1. Description. In the extreme  east of the Medi-terranean Sea, in the angle made by the southern shoreline of Asia Minor  and by the coast line of Syria, liesthe Gulf of Iskanderun.  The  general direction of thegulf inwards to the land is north-east, with an approxi-mate  length  of 37  miles (nautical) from the  opening,,which may be taken as the  line  between the  pointsjKaradash  on  the north,  and  Ras-el-Khanzir on the(south. The distance between these two points is 25 miles(nautical),  and at about 10 miles within this line thewidth of the gulf is contracted to 20 miles (nautical)which is the average breadth, within a mile or two, ofthe gulf throughout its area.      .1.&apos;/;/              ^                   ALEXANDUETTA.    2.  Position. On the south-eastern  shore  of thegulf, about 26 miles (nautical)  from the point Ras-el-Khanzir, is the town  and  harbour  of Alexandretta,situated in the bay of that name.  The town is built ona strip of sand  and  shingle to the west of the bay, andfronts north-north-east.  On either side of the town andbehind it are marshy grounds which become swampy inwet weather.   Wheu the water becomes low in the drvweather,  fever  is said  to be  very prevalent.   Inlandfrom the marshes to the foot-hills, some 2 miles to thesouth and  east, is  cultivated ground.   Cultivation issaid to be gradually reclaiming  land from the marshes,which  have  also been improved by  drainage.  Thedrainage works, however, suspended since 1909  by orderof the Ministry of Public Works, have apparently notbeen resumed.    3.  Climate. Apart  from the fever-bearing periodreferred  to above,  when it is  disagreeably hot  withenervating winds, the climate is delightful once the hotweather has broken.  In the winter, from December    [424]
onwards, the Mils are snow-covered and tlie climate iscold, but there is a good deal of sunshine.   4. The Town. The town consists of warehouses andstone buildings  built on both sides of the main streetwhich runs east and west parallel to and about 50 yardsfrom the shore.   The houses are  tiled, and little woodseems  to be  used in their construction.   The townspreads along the shore  and  extends irregularly  forhalf a mile or so inland in the direction of the BailanPass, which is 1,530 feet above sea level, on the mainroad to Aleppo,  and  is made the summer residence  ofthe better class of inhabitants of Alexandretta.   5. Population. The  population   numbers   about12,000, consisting of  4,000 Turks, 3,000 Nusarie, 4,500Christians (Greeks), and 500 Jews.  In 1913 there weremore than  350 British  subjects,  including   BritishIndians, in the Aleppo district,   (&apos;i. Trade. Alexandretta is a considerable commercialcentre owing to  its harbour and its proximity to Aleppo,which is distant by land about 96 miles.  There areno  manufactures or industries  of  importance,*  butAlexandretta, being the only port of note, j the importsto and exports  from the Aleppo vilayet, pass  throughit.   The trade of the port with  the interior is carried onby means of caravans of camels, mules,  and donkeys,and  also  by fourgons  or  springless wagons.   Thedevelopment  of  the railway  system  in  the   Aleppovilayet has affected  the trade materially,  but it  isthought that  this will be compensated by the railwayfrom Alexandretta to the northern system.    7.  Water Supply. Copious springs from under alimestone sandstone spur,  about a mile  south of  thetown, accumulate water in a  reservoir  50 yards squareand 4 feet deep.   This water is conveyed to the  town byducts  at the  rate of  1  cubic foot of water a  second.Water is laid on by pipes and taps in  the  street whichsupply a small flow.   8. Anchorage. The anchorage in  the  bay is goodthroughout at from 3 to 4 cables from the shore, with7 fathoms  of  wrater, the depth increasing gradually to30 fathoms    miles off.  The bottom is clean  of sandand mud, and affords excellent holding ground.   The winds shift  rapidly, but protection from  theeast  and south is afforded by the range of the GiaourDagh, of which  the crest  runs nearly parallel to  thecoast line at  a  distance of 5  to  6 miles,  and by  itswestern spurs to  the south of Alexandretta.   The GiaourBagh averages about 5,000 feet, and  is  snow-clad  inwinter.  Northerly winds are rare, but are troublesomewhen they occur, and make landing very difficult.  Thereis  a  considerable  swell during south-west gales,  butlanding is said to be always possible.   On the wdiole theanchorage is secure and well protected.  There  is goodanchorage in Ayas Bay, on the opposite side of the Iskan-derun  Gulf, from 4  to 10  fathoms, sheltered from allwinds except from the east and south-east, which seldomblow for any length of time.   9. Proposed Port. Plans for construction of a portto the north-east of  the  town were approved in 1911,and work was begun in June 1912,  but little seriousprogress appears to have been made since then.   * A small farm for butter and cheese under the supervision of anArmenian was opened in 1913, and was likely to prove a success.   t Suedia serves merely for shipping cocoons in the autumn season.

   10. Landing  Places.-The beach  is  sandy,  andpresents no difficulties to landing except with  northerlywinds.  There  are no wharves of any description, butthere are eight jetties of light structure.  There is alsoan iron landing stage 100 metres in length, providedwith a steam crane, for loading  and unloading lighters.In the port  there are  twenty-eight lighters of about25-ton capacity and  twelve of about 15-ton  capacity,also ten sailing lighters.   11. Places of Assembly-On the  east  of  the town,owing to the marshy land coming right up to the coastroad,  the space for forming up troops is limited to thestrip  between the road and  the sea.  Round the bayand about H miles to the north is a considerable spaceof open cultivated land available  for  military purposes.Opposite this ground there are low earth cliffs from 4 to10 feet high, with only about  10 feet of  beach, whichmakes this part of the coast unsuitable for landing.   12. Roads.-- The  main road  from Ad ana and the.north clings to the coast line from the head of the Gulf,passing through  Payas  about  12  miles   north ofAlexandretta.  It is apparently kept in fair order, andis fit for light wheel  traffic;  in places, however, whereit is  contiguous to marsh land,  it  is wet  and soft.Passing through the town the road trends to the south-east  towards the Eailan Pass.  It is the  main  road toAleppo (155  kilom. 96  miles)  and beyond,  and  ispartly metalled from the Aleppo  end. About  half ofthe Alcppo-Alexandretta road  was  repaired in 1913.There is a poor track  leading south-west to Suedia, andtwo or three  tracks to the  east over the marshes  leadingto farms under the foothills.   13. Raikvays. On  the  1st  November,  1913,  abranch line  of railway was  opened  between  Alexan-dretta and   Toprakaleh.   This line  is 60  kilom. inlength, and following  the  coast road as far  as   Payas,touches the  villages  of Deurtyol and Erzin, and joinsthe main line running westwards.to Adana, and  bevondDorak to Gulek, to which  place the line is open.0   14. Railioay System. The railway system affectingAlexandretta is that  on the  north  and west, viz,, theBagdad Railway, and that on the south and  east, viz.,Beyrout-Aieppo Railway.   The Bagdad Railway startsfrom  Scutari on the Bosphorus, and goes through Konia,Karaman and Eregli as far  as the Taurus  Mountains.Erom the  north side  of these mountains it is  incom-pletc  to Gulek, mentioned above.  Erom that point  itruns  east  (connecting with the  Alexandretta  line atToprakaleh)  as  far as  the Amanus  Pass, where it  isinterrupted  by  the  boring of the Baghtche series oftunnels 6 kilom. in length. Erom thence it is projected torun south to Aleppo, from which place part of the line iscompleted.   The Beyrout-Aieppo line (connecting fromthe former to the south with   Damascus, Acre and theIlijaz line) has apparently been completed from  Aleppobeyond Jerablus eastwards to  a place called Harran, ona tributary to the Euphrates.   * On the 22nd December, 1914, H.M.S. &quot;Doris&quot; damaged twoTurkish trains and several railway bridges on this line, and afterwardslanded an armed party at Fayas  which destroyed a large bridge withgun-cotton.  The only two locomotives  at Alexandretta were alsodestroyed.  It is not known what, or if any, efforts have been made torepair the damage.
     15. Telegraphs. There  are  post   arid  telegraphoffices in the town; six  wires lead  towards  the BailanPass, and five north;  of  the former two go to Antioch,three along the  Aleppo rush road, and one to Suedia*(1911).    16.  Distances.-Tables  of distances  by sea and byland to points of importance  are attached.       References:           Military Report on Syria.   (1911.)          Turkey  Coast  Defences   N.I.D.
