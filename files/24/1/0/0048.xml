Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  November 1915.SECRET. G.-43.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.The  Future  Military  Policy at  the  Dardanelles.Memorandum by the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial                         Defence.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,            November 2&apos;9, 1915.
THE  FUTURE MILITARY POLICY  AT THE DARDANELLES.     MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP THE COMMITTEE OE IMPERIAL DEFENCE.      This Memorandum  has  been prepared  and  circulated by order of the Prime Minister.  It is a departure from the usual  practice of the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, who makes it a point not to obtrude his personal conclusions on controversial questions.   It has always been felt that for the Secretary of an Advisory Committee to adopt  such a  course is contrary to his constitutional position, which compels  him to keep an open mind.  On the present  occasion the Prime Minister has decided,  at the express request of some of  his colleagues, that there  are exceptional reasons for departure from the usual practice, owing to the fact that the  Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence has been present at every meeting of the old War Council,  and  the present War  Committee  since the  initiation  of the  Dardanelles operations, and has, in addition, paid an extended visit to the locality. Nevertheless, the opinions in the following  Memorandum are advanced with considerable diffidence, the more so, that the writer has no responsibility.  An apology is necessary for the prolixity of this Memorandum, which is mainly due to the very short time available for condensation.      2. In seeking  to reach  a  correct appreciation  of  the numerous considerations bearing  on the future  of  our  military  operations in the  Gallipoli  Peninsula it is convenient to begin with an examination  of the  bearing  of  this campaign  on the operations of the different nations engaged in the Avar, and this involves an attempt to penetrate the strategical designs  and intentions of  the enemy,  as well as those of the Allies; the latter task being almost as difficult as the former, owing to the absence at present of any clear plan  of action.                              Strategy of  the Enemy.      3. The Germans invariably base their plans on strategical principle.   If one strategical principle fails  they fall back on another, as has occurred in the present war. Without entering too far into  a  pedantic dissertation on  strategy,  it may  be said broadly  that  there  are two  methods of  making war:  The best method when means permit is to crush your enemy completely in order to obtain an unlimited result, so that your enemy is compelled to make peace and accept  such terms as you choose to! offer.  The alternative, where the forces of the rival Powers are more evenly balanced and unlimited success cannot reasonably be  expected, is to get assets into your hands and to hold them until the enemy has exhausted himself in efforts to recover them, and has to make terms.  In  1830  Clausewitz,  when drawing up  a plan for war against France, proposed that since the Prussian armies were  not strong enough to  capture Paris they should occupy Belgium and hold it until the Erench had worn themselves out in their attempts to recover it.  Similarly, in 1859, von Moltke&apos;s first plan for war against France contemplated the occupation of Alsace and Lorraine with precisely similar objects.      4 In the present war it is plain that Germany, trusting in her superior strength at the outset, originally aimed at a decisive result by endeavouring to crush the Anglo- French armies.  Having failed, she sought the same result by an attempt to crush the Russian armies, hoping, no doubt, to obtain a separate peace with Russia, and then to renew her efforts for decisive results in the  West with all her strength.  Once more she  has  failed.   Foiled  in  the West and foiled  in  the East  in  the hour  of her greatest strength, Germany, now that her  military power has passed  its zenith, can hardly hope  any longer  to  dictate peace  on her own  terms.  In the West it is unreasonable to suppose that  she can succeed against Allies who  in men and material are incomparably stronger than they were a year ago and will  grow stronger every month.   In the East, winter  has brought a breathing  space to  the Russians, which        [1277]    ^ o                             .    .(    ^
 should enable them to recover and re-equip their great reserves of men before summer enables the enemy to resume the offensive.  Although, this period may possibly not be of sufficient  duration to enable Russia to withstand  a renewed attack when weather conditions  and a reorganisation of  the German  communications  render it possible for the Central Powers &quot;to resume the offensive, at any rate it compels a much greater effort by the  enemy and renders a decisive success by the Central Powers in the main Eastern theatre far more doubtful.     5. Germany, therefore, seems  to  be driven back on warfare with a limited  object. She  probably reckons that the  difficult financial  situation, which  wdll confront  the Allies in 1916 (due to the apparently inevitable collapse of their American exchanges), will  in due course compel them to consider the desirability of making peace.   If  she can only continue to hold on to Belgium, North Erance, Poland, and Serbia until then, she will have a good deal, in hand to. barter against her captured colonies and her loss of access to the open sea.  But, with her numbers declining (relatively, to her enemies, at any rate),  there is no certainty that she can even hold what  she  has  gained, if  her enemies can bring their full strength to  bear.   It is necessary, therefore, at all costs to compel the Allies to disperse their forces, and, above all,  to ensure the  continued interruption of  free communication between  the Western and  Eastern  Allies, so that the numerical  masses  of the  latter may  not be  armed and equipped by the ever- increasing  industrial activities of  the  former.  Moreover,  the more assets she can secure the better bargain will she obtain when peace ,&apos;is discussed.     6. In this  spirit, then, the Central Powers have undertaken their Eastern enter- prise.   Playing on  Bulgarian  resentment  and  cupidity,  they  have  brought that country to war with Serbia, and they seek nothing more than to embroil the Bulgarians deeply in war with the Allies.   The same  stroke  has enabled them to bring relief to the Turks, who were becoming anxious  and distrustful at their  inability to turn the Allies off the Gallipoli Peninsula.  Having restored the confidence of the Turks by freeing Constantinople from its menace, and thus given an  earnest of  her ability to fulfil her promises, Germany  may  hope to persuade them to undertake  formidable offensive operations in the Caucasus, in  Mesopotamia, and in Egypt, and  it is clearly their design  that these manoeuvres, should  react  into  Persia, Afghanistan, and even India, causing  both  the British and  Russians to divert troops to  protect what have hitherto been regarded as essential interests.     7. The subtlety  of the  plea  lies in  the  fact that it is brought  about by a ridiculously small application  of force  by the Central  Powers.  It resembles  a line of children^  bricks standing on end: all that is  required is the  momentum to upset the first brick, which causes the next one to upset its neighbour.   All the force that the Central Powers exert is the  bare  minimum to enable Bulgaria to conquer Serbia ; this  establishes free communication between the Central Powers and Turkey enabling the latter to turn the Allies out  of the Gallipoli Peninsula; this re-establishes Turkish confidence  in German  might and  induces her to undertake operations against the Allies; this again reacts into Persia, Afghanistan, India, Tripoli, Algiers, and Morocco, compelling the  Allies to fallback on the defensive at half a dozen points, dispersing their  forces, and preventing a decisive offensive when their military strength reaches its zenith.    Although  this is the main object of  the Drang nach  dem Osten, it offers important subsidiary advantages.  It  ensures  that Roumania will not for along time join the Allies, and even opens up the possibility of active  co-operation  on the part of that country.   It enables  Germany to draw on the resources  of Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, and probably Roumania, to make good, her economic deficiencies in grain,  meat, fats, copper, oil,  petrol, and  cotton a  subject  on  which the  Board ofTrade have undertaken to enlighten the War  Committee in greater detail.  It safe- guards the  important commercial enterprises of Germany in Turkey, and opens up theprobability of future concessions on a  much larger scale whenever the Central Powersare in a position to take advantage of  them.                           The Strategy  of  the Allies..     8. Such,  then, would seem, to be the general strategical plan and the political advantages sought for by the. Central Powers.   The next step is to consider the means available to the Allies to checkmate them, and more particularly the place which the
Gallipoli operations occupy in their plans.   Eirst, therefore, it is necessary to reviewthe general strategical position from their point of view.     9. At the outset of the war the military superiority of the Germans compelled theWestern Allies  to  remain on the defensive.  Even so it was only with the utmostdifficulty  that the  German onslaught was  held up.  The Russians, though able toassume the offensive for a time, both in East Prussia and Galicia, were also before longcompelled  by lack of munitions  to adopt  the defensive  and to make  strategicmovements to the rear on a great scale.   Now, however,  the  positions are changing.Although  the German strength  seems to have passed its zenith,  the might of theWestern Allies, both in men and  munitions, does not approach its maximum  until thespring and summer of 1916.   On the other hand, their financial resources  and theirpower to carry  on the war will be gravely embarrassed, and,  in  consequence, theireconomic position  will be impaired at about the same time as  their military powerreaches its maximum.  At that time the Russian military  strength,  it is true, will stillbe far short of its maximum potentialities (in fact, it is doubtful whether it will everhave time to attain  its  maximum in the present war  unless the  calculations ofresponsible experts  regarding the  financial powers of endurance of  all the contestantsare gravely at fault).  Nevertheless, it seems probable that by the spring or summer of191(5 Russian military power  will be  sufficient to contain a very large enemy army.Moreover, it  is absolutely essential to the  cause of the Allies  that this should  be thecase.  As the General Staff point out in their memorandum of the 22nd October, &quot;Wecannot afford to  do  anything that might cause a slackening of Russian efforts.&quot;     10. Clearly, then, the spring and summer of 1916 is likely to be the most criticalperiod of the war.   A serious mistake now may cause a faulty distribution of ourforces then, which may make the  success of our main strategical plans impossible.     11. What, then, is the plan of the Allies ?  The fact has  to be admitted that atpresent they haven&apos;t one !     12. The  British  military  authorities, both  the General  Staff  at home  and theCommander-in-Chief and his General Staff in Erance, have no  doubts as to what oughtto be the plan.   They are  confident that, if all our military resources are concentratedin France, they can inflict a great, and, perhaps,  decisive,  defeat  on the  enemy.  Tothe criticism that they have failed again and again in attacks preceded by an equal eon-fidence, they reply that they never before had the men and the munitions on an adequatescale, that the enemy is weaker, and that they have learnt from past  experience.   Thisconfidence  has  spread throughout  the army to  Officers  who, until recently, almostdespaired of ever breaking the line.     13. The  Russian General Staff, on the other hand, seem to have come to the con-clusion that frontal attacks against entrenched lines,  where the machine beats the man,are hopeless, and that the  Allies ought to utilise their numerical superiority by a greatturning movement in south-eastern Europe.   Whatever might have been the advantagesof this method of fighting the war, if  the Dardanelles were open, and if the Serbian armywere still intact on its  own soil, and if Bulgaria had not joined the enemy, it would nowseem a chimerical plan.  It would involve the defeat of a  Bulgarian army of 350,000men (which otherwise will probably play no part in the war  outside Macedonia); itwould necessitate a preliminary  advance of hundreds of miles through a difficultcountry where a  special form of transport and artillery  would have to be  provided aform of transport and artillery, be it noted, which would be useless once the  plain  ofHungary was reached; it would  put an unbearable strain on  our shipping, and itwould hasten the approach of a financial catastrophe.     14 Nevertheless, there are signs that certain elements, both in Erance and  Italy,.have a leaning towards this plan.     15. Whatever the proper  policy may be, however,  there  is no  doubt that whatcauses the principal difficulty in reaching a decision as  regards the  operations in alltheatres of war, and notably in Serbia and Gallipoli, is the  absence of any plan at all.It is to be hoped that at the forthcoming conference of  the Allies, at General Joffre&apos;sheadquarters, some  plan will be decided on, and subsequently adhered to.
                Principles governing our Military Policy in the East.    16. Even in the absence of a general plan, however, it would seem safe to assumethat in countering the German Drang nach dem Osten, the following principles shouldbe aimed at:     (1.) The Central Powers, as distinct from the Turks  and Bulgarians, should be           compelled to expend as much energy as possible in prosecuting it;    (2.) The enemy should  be  permitted  to  extend his plan as little as possible in           case our own main plan (whatever it may be)  should not succeed and we           should eventually be compelled by exhaustion or by the weakening of our           Allies to discuss  terms  of peace while great advantages still remain with           the enemy ;    (3.) The force employed to counter it  should be as  small as possible, and this is           perhaps the  most important.                                     Serbia.    17. It will be noticed that  the ambitious and ingenious plans devised by ourenemies could, theoretically, at any  rate, be  met at  many points, e.g., in Serbia, atConstantinople, at Alexandretta, or by  acting defensively in Egypt, Mesopotamia, andthe Caucasus.    18. As far back as July it was becoming  tolerably  certain that  something of thekind was meditated by  the  enemy.  At that time it might have been possible todefeat the plan in Serbia.  The Serbian army was intact;  M. Venizelos was in powerand Greece was friendly disposed; Bulgaria was not at war and might have been keptfrom entering the war by decisive action.   We were, however, deeply committed tothe Dardanelles operation, which then offered  good  prospects of success; and later,when  the Dardanelles offensive of August had failed, we were preparing for a  renewedattack in  Erance ; the British and  French  military  authorities in  Erance  weresceptical regarding the likelihood of  an attack on  Serbia,  and, further, representedthat an attack in the West was the proper strategical  method of preventing an attackon  Serbia by drawing thither the forces destined by the enemy for the Balkans ;  theyfurther pointed out that this attack in  the West could only succeed if all our availableresources were concentrated  in France.  Whatever the results of that offensive move-nient  (and they must not be underrated), the  military authorities proved wrong aboutSerbia.  The text-books say that &quot;the object  of fortification is  to set free  troops foroffensive operations.  The Germans  relied  on their fortifications, repelled our frontalattacks, set free the very  moderate forces  required, and opened  successfully a flankattack against our position in the East.   When it was too late, a force was sent, undercompelling  political pressure from our Allies, to Serbia much against the adviceof all our military authorities.  The detachment of this force has, indeed, probablyexerted  absolutely no  influence on the result of the war, and all British and, it isbelieved, most Erench military authorities  are agreed that the sooner we are quit of itthe better.    19. Although it is too late to counter  the enemy in Serbia, it is clear that everyeffort  should be made to keep the Serbian army intact.  Even a guerrilla force, basedon inaccessible mountains in Montenegro and Albania, may compel the Austro-Germansto detach some forces to guard their communications to the eastward.    20. This brings us, then, to the second point at which the German threat to theEast may be met, namely, at the Dardanelles  and Bosphorus.                                The  Dardanelles.    21. Before coming to the more local aspects of  the question, it is  necessary toadvert to  one politico-military aspect, which  is of very  first importance, viz.,  theattitude of Bussia.  The General Staff states that: &quot; Bussia has hoped and probablystill hopes much from  the   Dardanelles operations&quot;;  and further ou:  &quot;We havegrounds, however, for believing that  in Bussia,  even  if  the  Government and  themilitary authorities appreciated the reasons for withdrawal, the people would be greatlydisappointed and disturbed by it.&quot;      [1277]              *                                            C
    22. It really does seem essential, before evacuation is decided on, that this politicalconsideration should hi definitely cleared up and an understanding reached with Russia.Information has  been received that  M.   Sazonof, in a  conversation  with CaptainGeorge Lloyd,  M.P.,  now on his  way back from Russia, expressed most emphaticopinions in favour of continuing the operations at the &quot;Dardanelles.   General d&apos;Amade,wdiom I met at dinner on Friday, and who was  passing through Eugland on his wayfrom  Russia, was emphatic  on  the point that  in Prussia, where public  opinion isbadly informed, little was known of the difficulties of the Dardanelles operations, andthat it was generally believed that  success would attend our efforts.    28. Never  before can  Russia have  realised so  overwhelmingly  the  long-feltdisadvantage under which she has  so long laboured of  want of access  to  open waterunencumbered with ice.  She has  made great sacrifices and sustained huge  losses  forthe cause of the Allies in this war.   The only advantage she really hopes to recompenseherself by  is the coveted possession of  the  Straits.  So long as we  remain on theGaliipoli Peninsula she will not relinquish her  efforts, as she  will continue to hope,and perhaps to  believe, in our success.  Will she continue to hope this after we haveabandoned the Peninsula ?   Will  she continue her efforts ?  These are the questionsto which answers are required.   Of course, if Germany were beaten  to  her  knees,Russia might attain her desires, perhaps  only at  the cost of a difficult and arduouscampaign ;  this she might not be  in a position to undertake, particularly if  Germanysucceeded in rendering Turkey in  any sense independent of external assistance  in  hersupplies of munitions.  But if peace comes without  the  utter defeat of  Germany towhich the Allies aspire, Russia will probably get nothing she desires.     24. It would bo an irretrievable disaster to lose the co-operation of Russia  in thiswar, and perhaps to breed hostility and mistrust for generations to come.   Notwith-standing the objections  to  delay (a  subject which will be  discussed later), it issubmitted  that, before the  finai decision is made, a clear  understanding  should  bearrived at with  hussia.   Perhaps the best method would be for a British military orpolitical representative to approach the Tsar direct  and in person in order to limit, asfar as possible, the number of persons to be consulted; but others will be a better judgeof this than I.     25. Leaving Russia for the moment, it will now be convenient to examine  theposition of the Dardanelles operations in the light of the three principles postulatedabove in paragraph 16.     26. The immediate evacuation of the Gallipoli  Peninsula would clearly be aviolation of the  first principle, for it would  enable the enemy to attain his  objectwithout any expenditure  of German or  Austrian  energy  at all.   At  the  ParisConference on  the 17th November, 3915, Colonel Girodon  was  quoted as holdingthe view that the Allied  troops, if  properly relieved, could never be driven out  by  theTurks,  however much they  were  supplied with, guns and munitions, and it was onlyGermans who could drive them off the  Peninsula.   By evacuating we present anOriental Power with an overwhelming victory, which he could, perhaps, never achievewith  his own resources, only, in  fact, by rendering himself more than ever dependenton an. ally  who is more feared than liked.     27. Evacuation is also  a violation  of the second  principle, since  it  enables  theenemy to extend his plan to its extreme limits at once.     28. A more doubtful point is  whether or no the third principle, namely, that  theforce employed by the Allies to counter the Drang nach dem Osten should be as smallas possible, is satisfied best by holding on at or  by evacuating the  Peninsula.     29. On this point the calculations of the General Staff tend  to show that, so far as the defence  of Egypt is concerned, a considerable saving of men for the main plan of operations will be achieved by  evacuating, and thus  avoiding  the heavy wastage involved in holding  on, to say nothing of the probable loss if we should be  driven off the Peninsula.    It should be noted, however, that this is on the assumption that  the attack on Egypt will be relinquished  in  April, whereas General  Maxwell  (No. LG. 133,  dated the  22nd November) has since reported that there  is no reason  why  the Turks should not maintain their position after March.
     30. Moreover, the question cannot be judged from the standpoint, of Egypt alone. So long as we remain on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and more particularly if we can take the offensive there, we threaten the very heart of the Turkish Empire, and great forces must always remain in the vicinity of the capital.  Even a  tactical defensive on  the Peninsula is a strategical offensive, and as it always conveys the threat of a  tactical offensive  it must lock  up  large enemy  forces.   On the other hand, by withdrawal (since the Alexandretta project has been condemned by British and Erench military opinion) we fall  back on the circumference of a  circle of which the enemy occupies the centre.  We cannot tell where the enemy&apos;s blow will fall, owing to the inadequacy of  our intelligence  service, of which we had  recent  experience in  Mesopotamia. Consequently, if  evacuation is  decided on and  the enemy is free to exert  his full strength,  wre have to be strong enough at each point to meet the largest possible force that the enemy can  bring to bear.     31. Eor the defence of Egypt Lord  Kitchener has suggested a force of fourteen divisions.   A total of more than four divisions is now earmarked for the defence of the positions we have won in Mesopotamia, and who can say that they may not eventually have to be increased, if  the Gailipoli Peninsula  is abandoned ?   Por the defence of India we have already had to issue orders for reinforcing the garrison with drafts, and no  one can tell what will be the situation there or the extent of the call for troops, if the repercussion of the evacuation of GaUipoli causes fighting on the frontier combined with  internal sedition.   Bussia has, it is understood,. already a  cavalry division in Persia.  The latter country is seeking an alliance on the basis of an undertaking by the Allies to defend her against Turkey, failing which she unmistakably threatens to ally herself  to the enemy.  This may induce  Bussia to send  still more troops  to Persia. Bussia  again, the moment  she learns of an intention to evacuate the Peninsula, will almost certainly  feel herself obliged to reinforce  her troops in the  Caucasus to defend her interests there, since she will not be  able to say definitely that the main  Tureo- German effort will not be directed against that sector of the defensive circle.  Abandon- ment of the Peninsula is to pass from the  offensive to the  defensive with all  the usual objections  to that procedure.   Finally, there is the serious danger already alluded to that, unless Bussian  assent to evacuation is secured, that Empire may withdraw from the war, or, at any  rate, lose  the moral driving  power  behind  its efforts.  Either eventuality would prove calamitous to the cause of the Allies.    32. Erorn the above it would seem that,  the  third of the principles postulated in paragraph 16 no less than the first and second, would be violated by evacuation, if the position is reviewed from the standpoint of the total Allied forces likely to be diverted from the main theatre bv that cause.    33. If this appreciation of  the situation is correct, it would seem that the  certain tactical disaster,  which  all agree is inevitable to the evacuation of the  Gallipoli Peninsula,  may involve also political results which may prejudice the whole  of our military efforts in the forthcoming crucial campaign of 1916.   Erom the standpoint ofpure strategy, it is true, this might be obviated by  simply allowing the  situation in the East, in Persia,  India, Afghanistan, even in Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus, to take care of itself, trusting to our ability to restore it  later  on after the enemy  has  beencrushed in the main theatre.   Is it probable, though,  that either  the British  or ltussian Governments will have sufficient  confidence in our  military prowess to stakeall in this  way on  a  supreme effort  in the  main  theatre,  where  so many promisingattempts have ended  in stalemate ?    34. Bailing this  heroic course, the best plan would seem to be to  hold on at the Gallipoli Peninsula,  or,  better  still,  to take an immediate offensive  there  with the forces set free  from the  Salonica  enterprise.    Of course,  though,  either of these courses  may be impossible,  and this is the next point to examine.                             The Tactical Position.    35. It would not be becoming for an officer of junior rank with  scant  militaryexperience to set forth personal views on  a tactical question on which the greatestexperts on the  spot have evidently felt grave doubts, and there is no intention hereto do any  such thing.   It is necessary, however, to allude to one opinion expressed inmy report  (C.I.D. Paper, No. G-19) on  my return from the  &quot;Dardanelles, which has       [1277J                                                            D
often been quoted in the War Committee, and, it is understood, in the Cabinet as well.The actual text is as follows :          &quot; The situation in the Southern Area* is thoroughly  uncomfortable,  and     might* become untenable if the Turks  had a large supply of ammunition; but,     as things are, it can be held.&quot;     It is desired to draw attention to  the facts that this remark applies only to theSouthern Area (the position in the Northern Area Avas  not  sufficiently settled at thetime of my  visit  to  justify a similar statement);  also,  the words &quot; might becomeuntenable &quot; were purposely used instead of &quot; would &quot; because opinion on the spot wasdivided on  the subject.   Since  that time, General Davies seems to have expressed theview that he  could  hold  on in the Southern Area.  General  Birdwood  has  alwaysbelieved in his ability to hold Anzac under any conditions.   The principal doubt seemsto be as regards Suvla, although, curiously enough, it is  at Suvla that the prospects ofa successful offensive appear to  be considered the brightest.     36. Without venturing to express  any personal opinions as  regards the prospectsof holding on, it is submitted that, if the question of evacuation  were put  to the localCommanders in a somewhat different  way,  they might give a different answer.  Itmust be remembered that up  to now, and  from the day  of the  first landing, theDardanelles operations have suffered from want of  drafts.   Not even the usual 10 percent, to allow for casualties was taken to the first landing, with the  result  that unitshave never overtaken their loss and been at full strength.   This has aggravated theevils due to the strain of this trying  campaign, with resultant increase of sickness andlow moral.   The defence of the positions is very largely a matter of digging, and worn-out men  cannot dig properly, particularly when their officers are few and inexperienced.Supposing the Generals at the Dardanelles were told that the tired divisions would berelieved by the experienced regular  divisions from Erance, that  henceforward draftswould be forthcoming in sufficient numbers, that the tired  divisions would be restedand re-equipped in Egypt, and that thereafter there would be a systematic interchangeof divisions between Egypt and tbe Dardanelles.  Supposing they were told that theywould have ample supplies of ammunition;  that smoke  candles and 250 Stokes guns,with trained crews, are now ready  for them,  with more to come;  that flame throwers,water apparatus for washing away trenches  and other little supprises  for the  Turkswill  be forthcoming in the near future; that they are to harass  the Turks by everymeans in their power, to prepare to take the offensive whenever feasible, and that all.ranks are to be told that the whole cause of the Allies and the future  of  the  BritishEmpire depends  upon  their endurance and their  efforts, the  alternative  being  adisastrous and ignominious retreat.  It would be interesting to hear what their replywould be.     37. It is  the boast of our army in  Erance, that, since the  poison-gas attack inMay, for which we were  totally  unprepared, the  Germans, with all their masses ofguns and men and gas and elaborate lines of  communication, and proximity to theirsources of production, have failed to gain a  single  substantial success.   Yet there aremany positions where  they possess  the  advantage of  tactical position, notable theYpres salient, and the new salient  between Loos and the Hohenzollern redoubt, wherethe communications are understood to  be almost as  exposed as those on the GallipoliPeninsula.    If they have failed  here, why should  they  inevitably succeed  at theDardanelles, at the end of a very long line of communications, the last stages of whichare extremely precarious and difficult, and where the main instrument must always bethe Turkish army,  which is indifferent  in the attack, however strong in the defence ?                            The Date of Evacuation.     38. Another question  which  merits further examination is  the proper date forevacuation.   It is  generally assumed that the sooner this takes place the better, sincethe Turks are probably not yet fully supplied with ammunition  and the  shell-fire atthe beaches will probably be less.&apos;  There is force in this  argument, but  it must bepointed out that the Turks have always maintained a sufficient reserve of ammunitionfor a battle, and in any case they will probably have enough to  bring a heavy fire onthe beaches during the whole period of evacuation, and they will not hesitate to usetheir last round for the purpose, once they see that we are set on evacuation.                           * The italics are not in the original.
    39. Moreover, there  is another side to the question.  We are already long pastthe time  when  the continuance  of  fair  weather  can he counted  on,  and  severalconsiderable spells of bad weather have already occurred.  One of the most dreadedeventualities  must be the sudden  advent  of  such  a spell of bad weather when theevacuation is half completed.  With the  original  positions evacuated, many troopscongregated on the beaches, quantities of wounded men, for whom there is no properaccommodation, and possibly an insufficiency of water and supplies, it is difficult to seehow a surrender could be avoided,  if  stormy  weather supervened.   It is possible,however, that the meteorologist attached to the expedition may be able to choose aspell of good weather.    40. Nevertheless, it should be noted that by holding on until the end of Aprilgood weather could be almost  relied  on, and  further, by that time  all danger of anattack on  Egypt on a great scale  would be past, for no one has suggested  that anattack could  be  initiated after  the end of March, even though General Maxwell hassuggested that a force which had crossed the  desert might maintain  itself on or nearthe Canal.   To hold on even for two months would diminish the  risk of  an attack onEgypt, since some time will be required to  move a Turkish army from the Dardanellesto Syria; but on the other hand it must be admitted  that in two months&apos; time theweather will be nearing  its worst.  At any rate, if it be true that four months arerequired to prepare for an attack, as stated  by many officers of  high rank in  Erance,where communications are  of the best,  there would  appear  to be no imminentdanger at  the Dardanelles, where  munitions and German troops have to be broughtfor great  distances, and where  communications are indifferent.    41. The recent  telegram  received  from the  Senior  Naval  Officer  in  theMediterranean and circulated to the Cabinet would  seem to indicate that it is alreadytoo late in the season to  carry out the desperately difficult operation  of evacuationwithout a strong  probability of tactical disaster. If this is the case would it not bebetter to go down fighting, if we must go dowm, or better still to stick it through ?                                    Summary.    42. Summing up  the foregoing considerations,  it would seem that the GermanGovernment has formulated  a plan with the object of  drawing off our military forcesin 1916 the crucial year from the main theatres of war; of strengthening her owneconomic position;  and of sowing  distrust among the Allies by compelling the Britishand French to relinquish the one prize on which the Bussian gaze is fixed.  This planis based on a &quot;snowball&quot;  principle,  and is  calculated to  gather fresh  and activeenemies to us as it proceeds; Bulgaria is gone  over to the enemy; Boumania is  nowuncertain; Turkey, already hostile, will pass from  the  defensive to the offensive; theArabs will be lost the moment the  Gallipoli Beninsula is evacuated;  the Senoussi andPersia will immediately  follow suit;  and  India may be affected.  The moment wewithdraw from the Gallipoli Peninsula, the whole plan, carefully fostered by  Germanagents, is put into execution,  and the Allies are compelled to  lock up great forcesawaiting  attack  on the  circumference of  a circle of  which the  enemy occupies thecentre.  As it is too late to  meet  the plan  in Serbia, and the Alexandretta project hasbeen ruled out,  the arguments in favour of  holding  up the plan in  the GallipoliPeninsula appear overwhelming, provided that  it can be  done, and this is the crux ofthe whole question.  The decision on this point, however, is an appalling one, for itinvolves a choice between a certain disaster^ involved in evacuation, and the possibility,or, as some think, the probability, of greater  disaster  involved  in being driven  out.It so happens, however, that good  divisions are about to be set free from Salonica, andthe main plea of this Paper is  that the question may be reconsidered from the pointof view of their possible use to save the  position on  the Gallipoli Peninsula, and, ifpossible, to take the offensive.  A second, aud  scarcely less important, plea is  that theRussians shall be  sounded in the most secret manner that can be devised before  afinal decision is reached.                             M.
