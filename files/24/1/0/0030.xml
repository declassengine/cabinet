SECRET.G-26 (d).PRfiCIS  OE  DOCUMENTS  AND  PROCEEDINGS  CON-    NECTED  WITH  THE  POLITICAL  AND  MILITARY    DEVELOPMENTS  IN  THE  BALKAN   PENINSULA,    OCTOBER 21-25, 1915.[In continuation of C.LD. Paper G-26 (c).]4:0th Meeting,Minutes, Oct. 21,      220. The critical condition of affairs in the Near East and the12-15 p.m.       possibility of the entire failure of the Allies in that quarter, and the              consequent danger to our Eastern  Empire, gave a greatly increased              importance to the situation in Mesopotamia and the Middle East.              The attention of the 40th meeting was confined to this subject, the              central question being whether our Mesopotamia expedition should              be permitted to advance to Bagdad, as General Nixon had proposed              on the 5th October.Dated Oct. 16,        (a.) His proposal had been endorsed by the Inter-departmentalG.-28.          Committee set up  by  the Cabinet on the  4th October, and their              report had been circulated on the  19th.   The Viceroy of India, on              the 9th, had also confirmed the demand for one division and some              cavalry.  In the interim two divisions had come to be  regarded as              necessary for a permanent occupation  and the possibility of their              being provided from India had to be  settled.Dated Oct. 19.        (6.) The whole question was now considered in the light of the              combined  Staff  appreciation  on  &quot;the  present  and  prospective              situation in Syria and Mesopotamia,&quot; which had been called for at              the last meeting and was now presented.                  (c.) With regard to Syria and Egypt, they reported that Egypt              could best be defended on the Canal. The  only practicable alter-              native was an expedition from the Gulf  of Iskanderun to strike at              the Turkish  communications, but this operation  was objectionable              on the ground  that the expeditionary force would  have to be of              considerable strength, and it would mean locking up a large body              of troops  indefinitely.  Moreover, our naval resources would not              permit   us  to  support this operation and carry on  at Gallipoli              simultaneously.                  (d.) As Lord Kitchener was unable to endorse these conclusions              with regard to  the defence of Egypt, he  requested  that the con-              sideration  of the report, so far as it concerned Egypt and Syria,              should be postponed, and the Committee should confine its attention              to Mesopotamia.Report, Oct. 16,       (e.) Since the last meeting the conclusion of the DepartmentalG.-28.          Committee had  been strengthened by an  additional minute by theOct. 16, G.-31.    Military Department of the India Office.   On  the new hypothesis              that  two more  divisions   would  be available  from  India,  the              occupation of Bagdad was pronounced safe.  It was further repre-              sented that, even if the Turks could spare 60,000 men to recover the              place, they could only he concentrated by using both the Euphrates              and the Tigris lines, and this should  be  rendered impossible by an              active commander with 25,000 men holding an interior position at              Bagdad.                    [1099-4]         -                             B
     (/.) With this view the appreciation of the General Staff didnot entirely agree.  They still held the opinion that, unless a largeAllied army landed at Iskanderun, 60,000 men might be employedagainst General Nixon, and in that case  his  position at Bagdadduring  the continuance of the war could not be regarded as safe.For  political reasons  they accepted Lord Kitcheners view that atemporary  occupation was  desirable, subject,  however,  to thisproviso that at  any moment it  should be in the  power of themilitary authorities to withdraw the troops.  But as it was probablethat the political  objections  to withdrawal would have to overridethe discretion of the military authorities, they definitely pronouncedagainst either occupation or raid.     ((?.) If, contrary to their opinion, a force  was sent it must bepurely Indian, and the responsibility for its maintenance must lie onthe  Indian  Government.   Under  no circumstances must troopswhich could be used in Europe be diverted from the decisive theatre.     [This conclusion, it will be observed, rests on the  assumptionthat the decisive  point always  lies in the  primary  theatre.  Theprecedents to the. contrary do not appear  to have been considered.]     (/i.) The  appreciation  was not found  convincing  by  theCommittee.   On the figures produced it  seemed that the  force theTurks were likely to be able to concentrate at Bagdad had  beenoverestimated,  while, on  a  balance of risk, the advantages,  bothmoral and political, that would  flow from the occupation had beengiven insufficient  weight.     (i.) The necessity of doing something to restore our prestigewith the Bersians and the Arabs was recognised.  For the Persians,so Sir E. Grey announced, we were too late they had definitely goneover to  Germany-but to the effect on the Arabs he attached thegreatest importance.    He  was therefore  in  favour of  takingBagdad, not for ourselves, but on the express  understanding thatwe meant to make it the centre of an Arab State or Khalifate.     (j.) In  favour of  the Staff view  it was objected that to takeBagdad and then  have to retire from it  would be worse than  nottaking it at all; but, on the other hand, it was argued that to confessour inability to proceed to a decision which the Arabs were expect-ing would ruin our cause in  any case.     (7c.) In support of Sir E. Grey&apos;s view, Lord Kitchener statedthat there existed a strong movement towards the formation of suchan independent State, which was backed by a  committee of Arabofficers in the Turkish army.     (I.) The final conclusion was to defer a decision till the  viewsof the Committee had been  put before  the Viceroy  of India, andthese were   to  be conveyed  in  a  telegram to  be  settled byMr. Chamberlain  in consultation with Lord Kitchener, Sir E.  Grey,and Mr. Balfour.     221. The question of operations from  Salonica  continued  topresent the  utmost difficulty.   No  change was perceptible in  theattitude of Greece, and the need of our having to stop her suppliesby means of a blockade was still in mind.     222. Sir F. Elliot reported that Colonel Napier, in view  of the Athens, No. 1082,possibility of Greece obtaining foodstuffs  from  Bufgaria, suggested 0ct:2Lthat a landing carried  out  by the Allies  at Kavalla would  be   ^[XT^advantageous for the following reasons : -                          &apos;   0 p&quot;m&apos;     ].  It forms  a convenient base for attacking   Bulgaria and           preventing her  from  importing grain  to  Greece by           cutting the railway line.     2. It will divert Bulgarian troops from Macedonia.     3.  If Greece  contemplates surrounding our troops at  Salonica           and forcing us to leave, it will enable us to frustrate           that plan.

By taking Porto  Lagos from this  direction we obtain an           easy access to the railway for forwarding  supplies by           lighters either to east or west and  delay Greece along           the Thracian  littoral.    223. Though  this line of  action found little support, thechances of success by direct action grew every day less promising.    The Serbian Minister at Bucharest had informed Sir G. Barclaythat it would be impossible to prevent Austro-German and Bulgarianforces joining hands in N orth-Eastern  Serbia.  The Serbian forcesin that  district  would be compelled to  evacuate it  in order  toprevent their retreat being cut off by Bulgarians  advancing fromthe Timok.    Under the circumstances  Sir G. Barclay reiterated the  opinionalready  expressed  by the military attache  (Bucharest telegramNo. 660) and Mr. Bouchier (Bucharest telegram  No. 666), &apos;%.&amp;., astrong concentration in Eastern Thrace and Russian co-operationfrom the Black Sea coast.    Though the course might involve the temporary evacuation ofSerbian territory, the military authorities at Bucharest consideredit. unlikely that  the Germans would undertake an invasion of Serbiafurther  south than a position which would cover  their Danubecommunications with Bulgaria.  The territory abandoned would  besmall in extent, and its temporary loss would be  more than com-pensated for by keeping intact  the  Serbian army for combinedoperation with us against Bulgaria and in Eastern Thrace.    224  Sir F. Elliot also  reported that  the  Serbian Minister  atAthens had received a telegram from the Serbian Prime Minister tothe effect that, though the defence had hitherto been satisfactorilymaintained, a catastrophe  might  occur  unless the Allied troopscould very shortly give effective assistance.    225. During the day the bombardment of the Bulgarian coastbetween Porto  Lagos and Dedeagatch  was carried  out  by theAllied fleets.  The Russian cruiser &quot; Askold &quot; took part, but, owingto bad weather,  the Black Sea fleet was unable to operate againstVarna.

Taking the war as a whole, the most serious aspect of thesituation was that in the circumstances we did  not see  our way  tofollowing the  French lead.   It was necessary to point  this  out  toParis, and Sir, E. Grey instructed  Lord Bertie that, in  view of therapid advance of strong Bulgarian forces and  the impossibility  ofsending large reinforcements of French and British immediately, itappeared to  the military authorities in London that General Sarrailwould be acting very rashly in attempting to maintain  his presentsmall force in a position which  he  described as possibly isolated anddifficult.  It seemed essential that his  force should be placed in aposition from which it could make sure  of being  able to retire onthe Greek frontier.    Lord Kitchener was in communication with General Mahon  asto how best  to support General  Sarrail.  The latter appeared to  beattempting to  carry out an operation for which General Joffre andthe Headquarter Staff considered 150,000 to be necessary.     Lord Bertie was further  told  that information had  beenreceived to  the effect  that the  Serbian army  could  no longerprevent  the Austro-German and Bulgarian  forces from  joininghands in North-Eastern Serbia, and that  the Serbian forces wouldevacuate that district.
     Germany would thus he assured of direct communication withConstantinople,  aud we must he  prepared for the  consequencesof that.     M. Zaimis had stated that whatever forces the Allies now sentto Salonica would be too late, and had advised that they should notbe sent.   He promised a continuance of benevolent neutrality, butwe knew that the King and  the Greek General Staff  were  opposedto any troops being sent to help Serbia, and there was reason tosuppose that a  change of attitude might- be forced  on Greece bythe energetic pressure now being applied by the Central Powers.     Lord Bertie was  directed to make these facts known to thePrench and British military  authorities, who  should consider themtogether.     227.  Prom  Montenegro there was nothing to hope, althoughshe had declared war upon Bulgaria on the 16th.     Count  de Salis reported  that  the Serbian Minister was not Cettinje, No. 153,satisfied as regards the situation between  Serbia  and Montenegro, p0^16&apos;The  King had evaded proposals for sending help, and, in the opinion K&apos; oct 22&apos;of the Serbian  Minister, it was better to  avoid trying  to provoke 3-25 p.m.  &apos;any change in his attitude or forcing him to a choice of alternativeto his present position, which amounted to neutrality.     There were no military operations in progress in Montenegro.     228.   Sir  P.  Elliot  reported  that   the Serbian successes Athens, No. 1090,(apparently some optimistic  rumours from  the  north  front) had Oct- &apos;22^greatly impressed public opinion, and some of his colleagues con- R&apos;     j^&apos;&apos;sidered the moment favourable for a fresh effort to induce the GreekGovernment to join us.  It was suggested  that, without making adirect offer of the coast of Thrace, the Allies should  declare theywould raise no objection  to its acquisition by Greece, who shouldbe fold at the same time that all previous offers would lapse unlessaccepted and acted on immediately.     Sir E. Elliot added that lie was still of  opinion, however, thatan essential condition of Greek action  was the presence of Alliedtroops in numbers sufficient to bar a German advance  southwards.     229.  In the  same connection  he further stated  that he had Athens, No. 1092,received the following communication from the militarv attache at 0ct &apos;22-S-ilnmVn -_         &quot;                                &quot;            D. 4-50 p.m.,fcdiomca.                                                         K 7.15 pmi    &quot; Please represent urgency, of immediate despatch of the main body oftroops.  Serbians  will probably stand where they are, and collapse may occursuddenly.   Germans&apos; will  then seek to have entry to Macedonia closed to us,and the Greeks may listen on the plea  that  our presence is dangerous to themand no longer of service to Serbia.  We must therefore maintain the impressionthat  we mean to send more  troops, as now the idea is current that  furtherdespatch is  dependent on Greek entry.  Once our campaign is started  Greekscannot demobilise; and  M. Venizelos  must be supreme.  General  Mahonconcurs.&quot;                                                                  &apos; .     230.  Meanwhile intelligence had come in  that Uskub was inthe hands of the  Bulgarians, and Sir E.  Grey found it necessaryto press more strongly upon Paris our  view7 of the unwisdom of theErench enterprise, especially as they could  not  rely on Russianassistance being in time.   Accordingly he informed Lord Bertie Foreign Office tothat the military attache in Serbia had reported the fall of  Uskub, ParisfNo. 2382,and aided that,  taking into  account the present situation and the ?)ct&apos;2&apos;2&apos;length of  time which  any Bussian force  wrould take  to get from  &apos; &apos;Archangel,  the  project of sending such  a force seemed  clearlyuseless, since it simply amounted  to the immobilisation of some14,000 men for an indefinite period.     Moreover, the question of  transport presented insurmountabledifficulties, and  the whole  operation would take, at the  very least,two months.\JO p.m.

Buchanan in so informing the Russian Government.     In a later telegram  he added  that  the  following  report hadbeen  received  from  the military  attache  in  Serbia,  dated  the21st or 22nd October :-    &quot; In the north the Serbians are being driven back very slowly, repulsing theBulgarian attacks in the  east.  Uskub has been taken in  the south.  It is scfar impossible to discover what feelings  are caused in Serbia by this mostserious situation.&quot;     231.  Italy, at least for the present,  was equally unwilling tosupport the hazardous move.  Sir R. Rodd  reported  that he hadsupported the step taken the previous day by his French colleaguein regard to the  assistance to  be  afforded  to  Serbia by Italy.   Hehad pointed out  to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that ItalyYposition  was  somewhat equivocal,  and that  it was surely to herinterest to put an end  to that  feeling.   .    The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he himself was in favourof acting on the  French Ambassadors suggestion,  and intended tourge it on his colleagues, but it  would be impossible  for them  tomove in the matter until there was some  indication of the resultsof the heavy fighting now in progress on the northern front.   Thisshould be possible within  the next three or four days.     He could not agree to the French proposal that Italian troopsshould land at Santi Quaranta, as the local  population would beacutely hostile to them.   If, however, the French landed  shortly,he thought the Italians might go to Durazzo, whence  the roads, ifnot good, were susceptible  of improvement.   He  feared that theSerbians  might look on  such a landing as  implying designs onAlbania, but  this, he said, was entirely  outside the intention  ofItaly, but the objection could probably be overcome  if an Italianand French landing were carried out simultaneously.     232.  From the direction of Roumania, on the other hand, theprospect was brighter.     Sir G. Buchanan  reported that a Roumanian colonel, who hadcome to Petrograd to buy horses for his Government and to arrangefor the export of coal, had spoken very encouragingly to the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs about the prospects of Roumanian  intervention.     The French military agent (? attache) had been discussing withthe Emperor  the  proposal that  Russia should send  200,000  menthrough  Roumania, and His Majesty appeared to be  favourablydisposed to the idea.     Sir G. Buchanan  said that if therefore we  could  furnish with-out  delay sufficient  rifles with  ammunition to enable  Russia  toconcentrate these troops  in  Bessarabia, the whole  Balkan situationmight be saved.     233. Here we were fully in accord  with France,  and Sir G.Barclay was  promptly instructed that if his Russian and Frenchcolleagues received instructions to request the Roumanian Govern-ment  to  consent  to the  passage  of  Russian  troops  throughRoumanian territory  he was  authorised  to associate  himself withthem, conditionally on the Russian troops being ready to move.     Paris and Petrograd were at the same time informed that theseinstructions had been sent.     234.  By this  time the  British  representations to Paris on thesubject of Salonica had been considered, and, in reply to the lastForeign  Office telegram  (Paris,  No. 2375),  Lord  Bertie reported
that the French Minister of War recognised the serious situation inSerbia, but argued that the best course was to send more troops toSalonica.  This was the present view also of the Trench  Govern-ment, and the  Political  Director himself thought  that  we shouldgive up the policy of promises  to Greece and show our strength bysending troops and also possibly using threats, letting  it  be knownthat a naval force was  assembled, say, at Canea.  A special Cabinethad been summoned that morning to consider the  contents of theabove-mentioned  telegram, which  had been  communicated to theMinister of War by the military attache.     In  a second  telegram  Lord Bertie added  that  the French Paris, No. 789,Ministry of  War did not share  the  anxiety of the British  military Oct. 23,authorities as to General  Sarrail&apos;s position.                         R&apos;  8.20     235. Later in the evening, in  reply  to  the Foreign  Office Paris, No. 791,telegram about the passage of  Bussian troops  through  Boumania p01^28^(Paris,  No.  2386),  he  reported  that  the French  Government r.&apos;OctS,&apos;10 a.m.concurred in the reservation  of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.   Theyhad telegraphed to the French Ambassador  at  Petrograd, directinghim  to inform M. Sazonof that they had learnt on good authoritythat  Boumania would probably refuse the request if made now, andthat  it would therefore be desirable to say nothing till all  was ready,and then simply to notify the Boumanian Government.     They  hoped  that  similar  instructions might   be  sent toSir G. Buchanan.     236. On this day a final decision was come to on the subject ofcontinued operations in Mesopotamia, and the  following telegramwas sent to the Viceroy :     &quot; Nixon may march on Bagdad if he is satisfied that force he has available Secretary of Stateis sufficient for the  operation. Reinforcements will take time owing to relief to  Viceroy,and transport arrangements,  but two divisions will be sent as soon as possible. Oct. 23.I will telegraph probable date later.&quot;                          OCTOBER 24     237. With regard  to Greece, a discussion had been going on forsome time between the Entente Powers as to whether their promisedloan to Greece should go forward in view of  her equivocal attitude.Both our Government and Prussia were disinclined to go on, but nowLord Bertie reported that the French Government  considered that Paris, No. 793,they  could  not go  back on a promise given without conditions. r!0^3&apos;^&quot;llp-m-&apos;They considered that other means existed of  exercising pressure on 9.35 Cam &apos;Greece, if necessary, such as holding up of colliers, &amp;c.    238. Following  this  telegram was  one from Sir F.  Elliot Athens, No. 1101,stating that M. Zaimis had told the Itussian Minister that day that Oct. 23,the money advanced for mobilisation was almost exhausted, but that ^    P&apos;&quot;-&apos;he did not.like to approach  the  British and  French Governments 9.40 a.m. &apos;with a request for more lest they should make political conditions.The hint, however, wras clearly meant  to be repeated to us.    Sir E. Elliot said that the question was difficult.  If we did notlend the money it  might  be  obtained  in  Germany directly orthrough America, or mobilisation might be abandoned, which wrouldnot suit us until we  had quite given up hope of  assistance fromGreece.    239. A  few  hours  later  he was informed  that the Greek Foreign Office toMinister in London had handed in the formal reply to  our offer of Athens, No. 946,Cyprus.  He had been instructed to  draw the special attention of ^l^lbpmSir E. Grey to the terms in which friendly neutrality was promised.  &apos;He was informed that the  Greek Government would  understandthat the offer had lapsed, and  that the  question  of its renewal atsome future time must depend on circumstances, which could notnow be foreseen.
Kialievo, No. 470,       240.  Meanwhile the  position  in Serbia was steadily growingOct. 23,&apos;         worse.   Sir  0.  des  Graz  reported  that  he  had received  theR. Oct. 24, 2 p.m.  f0i]owjng priVate  telegram from Sir  R. Paget, dated Nish, 22nd                October:                     &quot;I have just returned  from TJskub, which I reached  from Prishtina.                Bulgarian troops  were within 20 miles, and were expected to enter at any                moment.   Town  was  deserted except  by Lady Pagefs hospital staff, which it                was found impossible to move with wounded and equipment owing to want of                transport.  General Officer Commanding  and other officers, however, told me                that there appears to be hesitation about Bulgaria&apos;s moving, presumably due to                uncertainty of their communications and  want  of  ammunition, and  that if a                strong force of Allied troops could press north within  the - next ten days and                help  the Serbians to retake the left  bank of the Vardar at Veles before the                Germans can get  communication  with the  Bulgarians  the  latter would be                forced to retire.   This would  both prevent the Bulgarians from obtaining a                foothold and would liberate Serbian troops for the north.                    &quot; The condition of this country is now pitiful.   Refugees from all parts are                flocking to  towns in Sanjak.   Unless  communication with Salonica by railway                is restored there must be famine.&quot;Nish, No. 459,         241. In the evening he sent  in a  full report of the  situationOct. 22, D. 8 p.m.,  communicated  by the Ministrv for Foreign Affairs under telegraphic  u     &apos;  p,m*   instructions from the Serbian Government:                     &quot; The situation on our front is more  and  more critical owing to lack of                sufficient troops.                    &quot;The Germans are  advancing without interruption although  slowly, for                they possess heavier artillery.  To the east the Bulgarians have already occupied                part of the railway line of the Timok; they have occupied Vrania, Kotchana                Egri Paianka, Kumanovo, Ishtip, Veles, and cut communication with Salonica.                    &quot; If, at the latest in ten days, from 140,000 to 150,000 Allied troops arrive                to aid us, then, according  to the opinion of military circles, we might prevent                advance of the Bulgarians and await the  arrival of  still  greater help  and                anticipate a successful action.   But we fear that  the help of the Allies will not                arrive in time.  That is why we beg the Allied representatives to make again                the most energetic representations to their Governments in order to obtain such                help as is indicated above.   It appears to  us that with this prompt aid the                critical situation  of the Serbians can  be saved, a situation which will become                critical for the Allies also  if  time is left to Germany and&apos;Bulgaria to crush us                completely.  If Serbia is crushed then the Allies will require many more troops                to vanquish  our  enemy in the Balkans than they do now.  We make a  last                appeal to the Allies, and if this appeal is  not listened to, then we  shall have                done all that we could, and it will nofc be in our power to do more.&quot;                    242. Sir G. Barclay also reported that the military attache had                received the following information from the Roumanian General                Staff :-                    Three divisions of the Bulgarian army and  one cavalry division                were  on the &quot;Vrania-Uskub  front;   four  divisions were  on the                Negotin-Zayechar-Pirot front; one division was near Dedeagatch ;                one division on the  line of  the Danube ;  one division on  the                Dobrudja frontier and  watching the Black Sea littoral.                    Two Turkish divisions were said to be on their way to  Varna.                    At  Belgrade  there   were  numerous   lighters   loaded  with                ammunition, while a  few  lighters were said to be at Orsova, where                a German division had arrived.  Sweeping  for  mines had  not yet                commenced at  the  Iron  Gates,   and it was estimated that fifteen                days at least would be required to clear a  passage.                    There  was  also said to be great  discontent in Bulgaria at the                appointment of  the Minister of War  (General Jekoff) to  be Com-                mander-in-Chief.  The Bulgarian reservists residing in Roumania                were not obeying the  call to the Colours, and  money was being                offered to them by the  Bulgarian military attache at Bucharest to                induce them to depart.                    Notices had been put up in the suburbs of Sophia advising the                Bulgarians not  to follow their King.                      [1099-4]                                          DBucharest,No. G74. Oct. 23,1). 8-45 p.m.,R. Oct.. 24,3 30 p.m.
     248. Hopeless as  any timely intervention seemed now to be, Paris, No. 792,from a military point of view, the French Government still clung to   ^ 2^11 Ptheir idea, and  the prospect  of  a  serious  difference  of  opinion  &apos;  c &apos;  &apos;111between us  was increasing.   Early  in the  morning  came  thefollowing telegram from Lord Bertie :     &quot;Presidents aide-de-camp spoke strongly  to military attache to-day onSalonica position, maintaining that having once embarked on it, it would be amistake to adopt any alternative.  He showed some fear of difference of opinionbetween the two Governments at this moment, and thought that French publicopinion might  easily be exasperated if we showed signs of backing  out ofSalonica expedition.    &quot; Military  attache&quot; had the impression that the interview was by order.&quot;     244 This had been preceded by another  telegram despatched  Paris, No. 794,at the same time :-               &quot;             &apos;                  R, Oct&quot; ^24 ^ P    &quot; Serbian  situation.  Minister  of War read to  military attache report  J 35 p&apos;m&apos;from  General Joffre expressing view that it is  necessary from  political andmilitary point of view to continue  operations with base at Salonica and to sendmore  troops.   With this view French  Government concur.  General Jolfreadded that the moment had  come  to consider measures for coercing Greece-atleast to maintain neutrality.&quot;     245. An additional reason for not proceeding with the operationwas that Bussia  found it necessary to withdraw  her  offer of  acontingent.     Sir G. Buchanan reported that the Minister for  Eoreign Affairs Petrograd,said it would be a great relief  to the General Staff if the Erench No. 1564, Oct. iGovernment would consent to relinquish the projected despatch of R&quot; ^ Pjn&apos;jRussian troops via Archangel.                                       &apos;         P&apos;     Sir  G.  Buchanan  added that,  since  writing  the  above,  thenaval attache&quot; had brought  an official request  from the  RussianAdmiralty to cancel all arrangements for the transport of troopsfrom Archangel, since the expedition was now abandoned.     Four thousand  seamen  had  been  ordered to  Reni  (on  theDanube, opposite Galatz), and the naval officer commanding on theDanube,  whose  command had  previously been independent,  hadnow been placed  under  the general  commanding the 7th Army atOdessa.   The Russian Admiralty thought that this all pointed toRoumania having given permission to pass Russian troops throughher territory.     246. At the same  time,  the cry of Serbia for immediate help Kralievo,  No. 4was growing more insistent.                                       Oct. 23, D. 7 p.     Sir  0. des  Graz reported that he  had  been  begged by  the 44.45^&apos;Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to repeat  his urgent appeal forAllied forces in order to hasten the solution of the present dangeroussituation.     Sir C. des Graz added that the danger was only too clear, andit was impossible to see  how  Serbia could hold out  alone for morethan a short time.     Unless the  Serbians regained communication  with  Salonicathey could get no more munitions nor food supplies.     Refugees  were fleeing south and west, and a  famine seemedinevitable.     247.  In  a later message he stated that the Allied representatives, Kralievo,  No.-1having requested  to be informed twice daily of the  situation until 0ct- 23: D- 7 Pthe arrival of the Serbian Government at Kralievo, two reports had 7&quot;. 9ct&quot; 24&apos;     1         .   t                                51          4-4o p.m.now been received.    The report of the previous evening was to the  effect  that  themost  unpromising situation was near  Kniazevatz.  It stated thatthough Greece declared nothing would  induce her to  enter intoaction, Greek  Headquarters Staff and army were at Salonica, and
Rome, No. 1042,Oct. 23,D. 930 p.m.,R. Oct. 24,10-20 a.m.Rome, No. 1043,Oct. 24,j). 2-45 p.m.,R. 5-30 p.m.Rome, No. 1047,Oct. 25, D. 3 p.m.R. 5-10 p.m.certain  movements of  troops  were reported in  the  direction ofMonastir.  &quot;A surprise was possible on that side.&quot;    The report of that morning mentioned the Serbian withdrawalon the northern front to new positions, and fierce fighting on theeastern  front near Kniazevatz.   There was also severe fighting inprogress in the new provinces, and the Bulgarians were  advancing.    248. As the hope of saving the Serbians  by direct action fromSalonica diminished  the  prospect  of  eventually  restoring  thesituation  by  Russo-Roumanian  co-operation  slightly  improved.Russia&apos;s action was contingent on her getting a new supply of rifles,and Italy had at last consented  to supply them.    Sir R. Rodd reported that  the  first 100,000 rifles for Russiawere being packed  at Bologna and  Naples.   He understood thatthere were only from 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 rounds of  ammunitionin Italy, which  must  be kept to supplement the supply in Libya,where the position was menacing.    Later he telegraphed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs hadby great insistence induced  the Prime Minister  and Minister ofWar to  give 8,000,000 rounds to accompany the rifles for Russia.(This represents about 27 rounds per rifle.)    The same evening he was able to say that the first 100,000 riflesfor Russia would pass Modane between the 5th and 15th November,and all the rest  by the 18th November.Petrograd,No. 1567, Oct. 24,I). 9-13 pm.,R. Oct. 25,9 50 a.m.Athens, No. 1103,Oct. 24, D. 2 p.m.,R. 6-5 p.m.Athens, No. 1105,Oct. 24,1). 2-15 p.m.,R. 6-45 p.m.Athens, No. 1107,Oct 24,P. 8-30 p.m.,R. Oct. 25, 10 a.m.     249. From  Petro^rad the news  was still more encouraging:.Sir G. Buchanan reported that the Emperor had ordered measuresto be taken for the immediate concentration of three  and subse-quently of two  more army corps  in  Bessarabia, but His  Majestyappealed to the  French and British Governments to furnish themwith rifles.  In order not to lose time, M. Sazonof had  been autho-rised to commence negotiations at Bucharest for the passage of thesetroops through Roumania as soon as the rifles were forthcoming.M. Sazonof  did  not propose at the outset to press the RoumanianGovernment to co-operate with us, but thought that  the concentra-tion of such a large Russian force on the Roumanian frontier offeredthem the opportunity for wrhich they had so long been waiting.    Sir G. Buchanan stated  that he had been  informed  by anEnglishman who had just arrived from Sophia that at Bucharest,where he spent several days, he recognised many German secretagents, who had evidently  transferred  their field of action from the.former to the latter  capital.  If, therefore, we did not take advan-tage of this opportunity of bringing Roumania in on  our side wemight find, as was the case with Bulgaria,  that we were too late.    250. In Greece the only definite change  was that, according toa report from Colonel Napier, the advanced units of  the 1st GreekArmy Corps had embarked at Piraeus on the previous day (Saturday,the 23rd), and that  the main body would leave during the week.    Sir F. Elliot expressed himself as anxious about the languageof menace towards  Greece  employed by the  English, French, andItalian press.  It appeared to him premature  and  unfortunate.  Itwas being made  the most of by the Germanophil press in Athens tostiffen the action of the opposition, and its effect on the King  waslikely to be the reverse of what was desired.    It was best not  to talk of  coercive measures until we wereready to apply them.    He also reported that the Greek Minister at  Sophia had tele-graphed that great depression prevailed there  owing to the numberof wounded being brought in.The conviction was gaining groundthat Germany had left Bulgaria in the lurch.   The bombardmentof Dedeagatch had produced a great effect, and three regiments ofterritorials had been hurried off there.
    In a later message he added that a semi-ofEcial news agency  Athens, No. 1109,had reported from Salonica that the bombardment of  Dedeagatch  D- Oct-and  the consequent conflagration  had  destroyed  the  barracks,   &apos;  ct&apos;25&apos;custom-house, grain  stores, steam mill, both railway stations, andthe first railway bridge.   A thousand soldiers had been killed andmore wounded.(To be continued.)PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BI C. R. HARRISON.-2/11/1915.
