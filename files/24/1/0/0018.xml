June 1915.SECRET.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.THE  DARDANELLES.Note by the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence.(Prepared by direction of the Prime Minister.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,    June 16, 1915.
THE DARDANELLES.           NOTE BY THE SECRETARY,  COMMITTEE OE  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.                   [Prepared by direction of the Prime Minister.]     1. AT the last meeting of the Dardanelles Committee the question was consideredof the  desirability of landing  a  force at Bulair.  Information was laid before theCommittee to the effect that our troops at the Cape Helies end of the Gallipoli Peninsula.even if reinforced, and even if successful in capturing the Achi  Baba  position, mightnot be able to reach the Kilid Bahr plateau owing to the great  strength of the fortifiedpositions prepared hj the Turks in rear  of those they now occupy ;  and that, even ifthey did succeed  in reaching Kilid Bahr, the forcing of the Dardanelles could  not becarried out without further extended operations, owing to  the elaborate  fortifications,including both torpedo tubes and  guns, prepared  by the Turks  during the last twomonths  above the Narrows.   It was suggested, therefore, that the  only sure way ofcompleting-the campaign was to cut off Turkish supplies  by  closing the land  routeacross Bulair, and&apos; this,  it was suggested, could only be done  by landing a  largeforce  and occupying the whole  isthmus.   Some doubt was felt by  the Committee,however, as  to whether, even  after  the  sea route and  the  Bulair  route  wereclosed, the Turks might  not draw their supplies and munitions across the Dardanellesfrom  the Asiatic shore.  There was also  a disposition in  the  Committee to considerthat it  was unsound to land a  third detachment at  such a  distance from  the twodetachments already landed that tactical co-operation between the three would be almostimpossible; it was  also felt that a force landed at Bulair would achieve nothing exceptto interrupt the route across the  peninsula, which there was no reason to believe wasextensively used, and to enable our submarines to remain in the Sea of Marmora, withoutthe necessity of traversing  the dangerous  passage of the Dardanelles.  In view of theprobable difficulty  of effecting  a  landing at Bulair,  and the military objections toexposure of the force to attack on  two fronts, there  was a  disposition to consider thatthe advantages were not commensurate with the risks.  The suggestion  was made thatthe same object might be secured by means of operations carried out in  the vicinity ofthe position now occupied by the Australasian Army  Corps.    2. The discussion of this subject was adjourned in order that further informationmight be obtained.    3. From the telegrams which have been received and circulated to members of theDardanelles Committee, the following points are cleared up :     (1.)  At least two strong fortified positions have been prepared by the Turks in rear           of the Achi  Baba position.   One  of  these  is just east  of Soghan  Dere           encircling the Kilid Bahr plateau as far as Maidos, and  there is a line of           redoubts in rear.    (2.)  The description given at the last meeting of  the  position  of the  Australians           was not exaggerated, though the alleged impregnability of Kaba Tepe is not           supported by Sir Ian Hamilton, as he says it must fall  into our hands if we           advance in this  quarter.    (3.)  The extent of  the  fortifications  above  the Narrows appears to have  been           exaggerated.  The only emplacements that have been seen are at  Gallipoli.           and as yet these have  no guns.  There  may be torpedo  tubes,  although           there is no confirmation of this.  It is very unlikely that this point will  be           cleared up, as it has never yet  been discovered whether torpedo tubes exist           at Soghan Dere, though they were suspected  to be there  before  the  war,          i and ships have frequently penetrated beyond this point.    (4.)  Sir Ian Hamilton is in full accord with the view of the Dardanelles Committee,           that the question of cutting  off  the  supplies  of  the  Turkish Army  in           the Gallipoli Peninsula  lies at the heart of the problem.      [738]
     4.  It is evident that the Turks have three routes for their supplies :-     (1.) By sea from Constantinople to Ak Bashi Liman.     (2.) By sea as far  as Panderma or Karabigha, and thence by an adequate road to           Chanak, whence they can be conveyed across the Straits.     (3.) A long and rather difficult land route by Bulair.     5.  None of the telegrams convey any suggestion that the Turks are at present able to draw supplies from Scutari  (opposite Constantinople)  by land, round  the  southern shores  of the  Sea  of  Marmora, or from Smyrna or the  hinterland  south of the Dardanelles.     6.  It is  evident that  our  submarines have to some extent  interfered with the first and second routes,  but there is no reason to suppose that they have  been able to interrupt them altogether.   The Turks have taken  the same steps as we have  to counteract the  effect  of  submarines,  and have adopted an extensive  use  of  small craft.  We have replied to this by sending into  the Sea  of Marmora  a  submarine equipped with.a gun, which will  be  able to deal with small craft, except in  so far as they  may  be armed.  At  present, however,  the number  of submarines  capable  of penetrating to the Sea of Marmora at the disposal of the Admiral is only             , and this only enables him to maintain              submarines at a time in the Sea of Marmora.  The French submarines  at present at  his  disposal are  not sufficiently powerful to make the passage and  maintain themselves above the Straits.  Further submarines are  being sent out, but losses must  be  expected in  the  difficult and dangerous traverse  of  the  Straits.   Having  regard  to  the number  of small  craft available, and to the number of the landing places, as well as to the probability that some  of the  Turkish small  craft may  in course of time be  armed, it would appear doubtful whether during the next two months we shall be able entirely to  interrupt the conveyance of supplies by sea, at any rate, as far as Panderna and Karabigha.    7. The objections to a landing at Bulair appear overwhelming.   The landing-places on the isthmus  itself are under fire  from the forts  at Bulair, and the experience  of dealing  with forts by fire from ships does not  warrant any confidence  that the Bulair defences could  be  silenced.   Further, these  landing-places are limited  in  extent, and both  they  and all  the landing-places  on the Gulf of Xeros,  with the exception of the coast near Enos, are defended by trenches and barbed-wire  entanglements.   If the landing were made at Enos there would be  a very long line of communications to Bulair, and the  Turks would have ample time  to prepare to meet us.  Moreover, even if a landing were successfully effected, the supply of this force by large ships, whether at Bulair itself or in the vicinity of Enos,  would  be rendered impossible  by the  German submarines.   A very large number of small craft would have to be  accumulated for the purpose. , Apart from this, a force at  Bulair would be exposed to attack  from two  sides at once, and  its withdrawal,  in  case of necessity, would be a matter of the  utmost difficulty.    8. The advantages to be  obtained from a landing at Bulair would be to interrupt this route for reinforcements and supplies, and to provide a base for our submarines in the Sea  of Marmora, obviating the necessity of  the passage through the Straits.   It  is evident  that Sir Ian Hamilton considers that  these advantages are not commensurate with the risks involved.  Moreover, he makes it  clear that, even if Bulair were occupied, the Turkish route of supplies from  Panderma or Karabigha to Chanak, and  thenceacross the Straits to Kilid Bahr, would not be interrupted.    9. The importance attributed to the Asiatic route of supply suggests the possibility that a surprise attack might be made on the Asiatic shore  of the Straits.  It wouidbe difficult for  the  Turks rapidly to transport their troops across the Straits, and  with the considerable forces which will shortly be at  Sir  Ian Hamilton&apos;s disposal it mightappear possible completely to overcome the Turkish resistance on this side.  The objec-tions to  this course are stated in Sir Ian  HamiltoiVs  despatch  of the 20th  May, whichhas been circulated  to members of the Dardanelles Committee.   He  points out therethat  the only possible landing is at  Kum Kale, and that the advance thence  to theNarrows would  be impeded by a  network of  rivers.   His right  would stretch into  a country  lending itself to the guerilla tactics  of the enemy, and his  centre and leftwould be under  shell fire from Kilid Bahr.  Moreover, the European shore is dominatedfrom Kilid Bahr.
     10.  The plan favoured by Sir Ian Hamilton is  explained in his telegram M.F. 328of the 13th June, which has been circulated to members of the Dardanelles Committee,and it is not considered desirable to  reproduce it here for  the reasons given in its lastparagraph.     11.  A point which appears to require consideration, if it  has not already beenprovided for, in connection with the despatch of reinforcements, is the  provision of afurther supply of small craft.  The Admiral states that our existing resources are onlyjust sufficient to supply the Gallipoli armies.   If these  armies  are to be increased itwould appear that the supply of small  craft would also require an increase.   Possiblysome  could  be obtained by raiding some of the Turkish undefended  ports, such  asBeyrout, Haifa, and Jaffa, where a good deal of the cargo work is done by transhipment.Some&apos; might also be obtained perhaps from Greece, Italy, and the French North Africanpossessions.    There  are  an  immense  number  of small  sailing craft  all  over theMediterranean which might be useful.   Inquiry is being made as to  the  statisticsavailable regarding small craft at certain ports in the Levant.                                                                    M. P.  A.
