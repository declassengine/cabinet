A  COMPARISON  OF  THE  BELLIGERENT  FORCES. -                               (1.) THE  ENEMY.;                             ,        &apos;                          -  GERMANY.  ...    IT is calculated that Germany at the commencement of the war could reckon on a;total of about 10,500,000 men of the fighting  age, liable to  be  called upon to serve.-This figure was arrived at by taking the total number of males of that age, and bydeducting from this total the  number of men found unfit for military service.   To findapproximately the  number of men actually available now, the numbers of men of thefighting age who cannot be spared from mines, from railways, arsenals, factories, policeand so  forth, have to be deducted; the numbers represented by the wastage which hasalready, occurred during  the  first 5 months of war  have also to be deducted.  It isestimated that the  number of men of the lighting age who could not be spared from therailways, factories  and so forth,  would  amount  to  approximately 4,000,000.*   Thewastage since the  commencement of the war amounts to  fully 1,500,000..  Deducting5,500,000 from 10,500,000, it leaves 5,000,000 as the  number  of men actually availableat the present time.                                     -           &apos;    Some doubt exists as to exactly how many divisions the Germans have, in the fieldat present.   156 are fully accounted for; but it has been reported that 36 more arebeing created.  To  be on the safe side, we may take it that half this number of entirelynew divisions are in  process of organization which raises the total to  174  divisions..The approximate number of men under arms is then arrived at as  follows :-       174 divisions  ....     ......     ...    .......   . ...     2,950,000       11 cavalry divisions  ...     ...     ...    ...     ...     ...       .50,000       &quot; Corps troops&quot;  (of 53 corps)      ...    ... &apos;.   ....     ...      300,000    *             Total field army      ...     ...  -   ...     ....     3,750,000Navy,  line   of  communications,  . garrisons  and   coast     defence  ...     ...     ...      ...   .  ...     ....    ...      350,000Training in depots   ...     ...      ...     ...     ...     ...  .900,0005,000,000    The present position therefore is that Germany has come to the end; of her resourcesin men unless her industries are to be  allowed to stop.  It has been estimated in thetable  above  that  there are  900,000 at present  training in depots.   At the  rate ofwastage of  300,000  a month  these  900,000 would  supply sufficient men to keep.the ranks of the army in the field up to its establishment of 2,950,000 for an additionalthree  months, so  that the army ought  not  to begin  to actually  run short of men forthat length  of time.   Supposing  on the other  hand that the wastage should drop tothe rate of  200,000  a month, which might prove  to be  the  case should the warfaretake  a  less  violent  form than  has been  the case  hitherto  (although it  must  be.remembered  that the numbers at the front now  are  considerably  larger than theywere during  the first two or three months  of the  war, and that  there are  thereforemore  men likely to become hors de combat), Germany would have sufficient men to keepher armies at their present strength for  from four months and a half to six months.                               AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.    The position of Austria-Hungary  is entirely  different  from that of Germany,because, with the much smaller forces which the Dual Monarchy disposes of, there seemsto be  no reason to suppose that the army would  actually run short of men within  anyreasonable time. ^ The training of the troops as a  whole must,  however,  already be of alow standard, seeing that it required very nearly the whole of the  trained men in the    * This is a very low estimate, judged by the figures of industrial employment in the country, see (5).

    But this  is taking the field  army at its full War Establishment;  after, its manyreverses it probably does not now muster more than 1,000,000.  -   ;&apos;                                (2.) THE ALLIES.                                     FRANCE.    .    ;  / :&apos; &apos;  ;  v              .&apos;/.     The situation in France is very different from that either in Germany or in Austria- Hungary.   The French have not added largely to the  number of divisions and army corps maintained in peace times like the Germans their  military: forces have not in fact been expanded relatively  to at all the  same  extent.   They work on the  principle of making sure that the troops which they actually oppose to the enemy are constantly kept up to their establishment,, and as a matter of fact they do not yet appear to have6 nearly exhausted the whole of the men who had  received training at the time that  the war began.  The French, it should be noted, are  not like the Germans  and Austrians, handicapped by having large numbers of their men of the fighting age  either interned in enemy  countries or else unable  to return from  foreign neutral  countries  oversea. They publish no figures, and their wastage is therefore  a question  of guess-work; but, proportionally to the strength of their troops in the field, they have probably lost about the same numbers as the Germans.  The numbers of soldiers, under arms in France at the present time appear to be  approximately as follows : ;        .&apos;               .   &apos;          Field army...     ...    .........      ..      ...   1,550,000          Navy, garrisons and coast defences     ....    ...     ...     650,000          In depots   ...     ...     ...     ...     ......    ......   800,000 &apos;-.                                                                3,000,000Some idea of the available resources in men is given by the following table :      Total number of men of fighting age    ....    ...         7,500,000     Deduct          Five months&apos;wastage       ...      ...     ...    ...   .750,000         Required on railways,  in factories, &amp;c.     ...    ...   2,500,000         Nowunderarms    ...     ...      ...     ... &apos;   ...   3,000,0006,250,000Leaves     .....................     ...  1,250,000    Should wastage continue at the rate of .150,000 a month the men not yet enrolledwill supply enough to keep the army up to strength for eight months, and the depotswill ,supply more than enough for another five months.   Should the  wastage on theother hand only be at the rate of  100,000  a month, the spare men and  dep6ts  willtogether provide enough to keep the army in the field up to strength for  one  year  andeight months.  The position  of the  French is thus very much more favourable than thatof the Germans in respect to making good wastage of war.                  \country to mobilize the army at the outset, that drafts have therefore from almost thestart had to be made up of men untrained before the war, and that wastage has probablyreached nearly 1,000,000.  Austria-Hungary does not possess any means of expandingher original forces, such as Germany has proved herself to possess, and the administrationof the military forces appears to have already practically broken down.  The probabilityseems to be  that the strength of the army will tend to decrease as  the  war  continues,and there is certainly no reason to suppose that the strength will increase.  It may becalculated approximately as follows :        FieldArmy ..........    ...   -  ...                   1,450,000       Navy, line-of communications, and garrisons     .... ... ;  . .    500,000       Depots      ............     ...     ...     ...     .   400,000   .                                                                 .2,350,000 .
12                                     RUSSIA.     When we &quot;come-to consider Russia, the question whether there is any possibility ofthe military forces running short of men disappears.  There must be  at least 20,000,000men of the fighting age available in the country, and there is not the slightest risk ofrunning short in this respect.  The feature  in  connection with Russia, differentiatingher from Germany, France, and Austria-Hungary, is that  owing to lack of arms andammunition only a  percentage of the men actually now serving can be opposed to theenemy.  But for this difficulty with regard to armament,  the Russians  ought at thepresent  time to  have  a force of 2,200,000 men directly opposing  the  enemy  in theeastern  theatre  of  war.  The total number  of  Russian troops  are  approximatelyas follows : Total field armies  ...Garrison troops, navy and coast defenceDepdts, say       ...    ...                        Total  ...2,800,000 . 700,000  500,0004,000,000    From the total of the field armies shown above  as 2,800,000, have to be deducted200,000 in the  Caucasus,  150,000  not yet arrived from  the  Far  East, and  about250,000 included in the special armies at Odessa and Petrograd, which makes the totalthat ought to be in the field  in the eastern theatre of war 2,200,000.   Our MilitaryAttache, however, reckons that at present the actual strength of. the field army inEast Prussia, Poland and Galicia does  not exceed  1,200,000.  The troops, in fact, are1,000,000 short  of  establishment, and  this is  almost  entirely  owing to  the want ofarmament referred to above.                                             .                     BRITISH, SERBIAN AND BELGIAN ARMIES.    At the present time the strength of the British Army actually  in,, the: theatre ofwar is about 300,000.  The  Serbian field  army may be reckoned &apos;at; 200,000 and canperhaps be - maintained at that strength for some months, although ,the wastage musthave been enormous during the past three years.   The Belgian field army cannot beput at a strength of more than 50,000.                        &apos;; ;     -.-                    (3.)

                       (4.) THE  GENERAL  SITUATION.     At  the  moment  the enemy  enjoys  the advantage  in  respect to numbers.   Thiscircumstance is accounted for, partly by the wonderful organization which the Germanshave shown themselves to possess in respect  to creating entirely new formations whichdid  not  exist in  peace  time, and partly owing  to  the serious shortage of arms andammunition in Russia.   If Russia  were not troubled by this  shortage, which is keepingabout a million men out  of the ranks of her field army in the  eastern theatre of war, theforces  of the contending sides  would  be  just about equal.    Looking to  the future,however, the present position ought to gradually improve  in favour of the Allies.     Germany can do no more in the way of increasing her armies, and will, a very fewmonths hence, begin to feel the want of resources in men to keep her existing armies up^to strength ;  Austria-Hungary is far more likely to go backwards in respect  to  numbersthan to go forward.  France, on the other hand, should find no difficulty in  maintainingher field constantly at  its present strength for many months to come, and Russia oughtto begin to get over her difficulties  with regard to armament in about three months, andought  to have greatly improved her  position within six  months.  Servia and Belgiumcan do little,  but the great expansion of the British forces  in the  early future has,tobe&apos;reckoned with,  and this  should&apos;prove the decisive factor in the later stages of thecontest.                                                                          .(5.)
