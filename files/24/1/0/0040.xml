[This Document is the Property of His Britannic M&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  November 10ID.  SECRET.   G-35.bCOMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.The  Question  of  Training Men for the Employment of the            Machine  Guns  now under Supply.Memorandum by the Right Honourable D. Lloyd George, M.P.,                   Minister of Munitions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,         November 12, 1915.
MACHINE  GUNS.    THERE are one or two points I wish to refer to regarding the utilisation of theincreased number of machine guns which are gradually becoming  available.   As anillustration of this increase the following figures wdl serve :     On the 1st July, 1915,.there were with the armies in the  field 1,376 machineguns.    As regards future supply the estimated deliveries (without  deduction for wastage)will be : Prom June to October 1915During1 November and December 1915During January, February, March 1916During April, May, June 1916  ..Prom July to December 1916  .. 3,000 2,026 5,61310,25629,13650,031    (The wastage may be gauged from the fact that of 17,116 to be delivered in June,1916,  6,400 will be for replacements).    Thus, after every allowance and  all deductions  necessary have been  made, thenumber of machine guns in the possession of the army will,  by the end of March, be farin excess of that in the possession of the troops at the end  of July last.    I wish to enquire if the Chief of the Imperial General  Staff is satisfied that every -thing  is  being done to take advantage of this  increasing stream of weapons by meansof training beforehand the specialists required, so that they may be ready to handle theguns when they are ready for issue.    A new body, called a  &quot; Machine Gun Corps,&quot; has recently been formed ; but I amnot quite sure what the announcement means, and I think we should be ready before-hand to  exploit it in a way we have never done before a most valuable arm.    I believe that one machine gun, with its  detachment of ten men, is at a very lowestimate equivalent in killing power to fifty  riflemen, especially on the defensive.  Ifthat is a correct basis.of comparison, we could nra,ke up for our shortage in men andobtain equivalent fighting value by training 200 machine  gunners instead of  1,000riflemen.   In other words, with  50,000 machine gunners we could do  the work of250,000  infantry.   We could also save in rifles, in which, so far I can see, the Allies arenever  going to obtain the numerical  superiority over the  Germans necessary for  adecisive victory.    It seems, also, that  if our machine guns  are employed  on a  large scale, on  acomprehensive plan, they  will,  in conjunction with barbed wire and  fortification, giveus the strategic power, so far enjoyed by the Germans alone, of taking large numbers oftroops away from  one front, where no offensive  is in contemplation, and transferringthem  to a quarter where active operations are intended.    This is what the Germans have done on the western front, to release men for thethrust against Russia, and what they are doing  on their eastern front,  to set free menfor attacking Serbia and  for action  on  the western front.   This power to replace men,which amounts to strategic  elasticity,  applies  especially,  I think, to  our  presentintentions on the western front.
