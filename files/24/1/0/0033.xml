TERMS  OF  REFERENCE.    IN accordance with a  decision of the Cabinet of the 4th October, the PrimeMinister  recommended that a consultation should without delay be  held betweenrepresentatives of the India  Office, the General Staff of the War Office, the Admiralty,and the Foreign Office on  the subject of  the strategic situation in Mesopotamia: To consider in particular, having regard to the position in Persia, to the progress ofthe Bagdad Railway, and to all other relevant matters :     1. Whether there should be an advance on Bagdad.    2. The defensive positions at Bagdad  as regards a  possible  advance of Turkish          troops.    3. Whether  without Bagdad as a point of departure any offensive operations on a          large scale could be made by the Turks in the neighbourhood.    4.

REPORT.    THE Oommittee had before tbem :     (a.)  Some former official telegrapbic correspondence on the subject.*    (6.)  Recent official telegraphic correspondence from the 29tb September up to the           10th October between the Secretary of State for India, the Army Department           of the Government of India, and General Sir John Nixon, the Commander           of the British Eorces in Mesopotamia, regarding the  defeat of the Turkish           Army at Kut-al-Amara,  on the  Tigris,  on the 28th September, and the           military situation created.!    (c.) Private telegrams from the 4th October up to the 9th October between the           Secretary  of  State  for  India  and the  Viceroy regarding  the  further           operations of  the  Mesopotamia Eoree, with  Bagdad  as  the possible           objective. J    (d.)  Memoranda  by the  Military Secretary, India Office, and the General  Staff,           War Office, dealing with  the  military  aspects  of  an  advance on  and           occupation of -Bagdad. $    (e.) Memoranda by the Political Department of the India Office, the Eoreign Office,           and Sir Louis Mallet dealing with the political aspects of the question.il    (/.) The views of the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief in India upon the military           situation in that country as conveyed  in a private letter from the Viceroy           to the Secretary of State for  India.    2. The question of whether an advance upon Bagdad should be  undertaken canbe considered from two aspects :-                       DESIRABILITY AND PRACTICABILITY.The Desirability of an Advance to Bagdad.    3. On political grounds the early capture  and  occupation of Bagdad are consideredmost desirable.  This will relieve directly the existing situation  in Asiatic Turkey, inPersia, and in Afghanistan.    To quote from the Eoreign Office memorandum (see Appendix VII):        &quot; &apos; Bagdad  is the centre of Government of  the whole district, and controls the greater   portion of the trade passing through.       &quot;&apos; The effect of such occupancy would weaken the power and prestige of the Turkish   Government  throughout the whole of Arabia, and would place within  British control the   sacred city of Kerbela. . . . .&quot;&apos;         &quot; An advance to Bagdad may be regarded from the political or Eoreign Office    point of view as of the very greatest importance, not only  on account of the    situation in Asiatic  Turkey, .... but more  especially  with regard  to  the    present critical situation in Persia and  even in Afghanistan.&quot;       &quot; &apos; The position of the Germans in Persia is entirely dependent  on their  being able to   keep open the road to Bagdad via Kermanshah.&apos;&quot;         &quot; In view of these reports, the material benefit to be obtained by an advance    oh Bagdad if, thereby, as appears probable, the German ascendancy and the    Allies&apos; precarious position in Persia can  be checked seems to  render this step    essential, while if no such effective action be taken, the danger to British interests    in Persia and in Afghanistan may be a matter of the most serious consequence.&quot;    Sir Louis Mallet writes (see Appendix VIII):          &quot; My reason for attaching so much importance to the occupation of Bagdad    is primarily that it is in Mesopotamia that we can inflict the maximum damage    upon Turkey at the least cost to ourselves.&quot;     * See Appendix I.             f See Appendix II.               J See Appendix III.         8 See Appendices IV and V.             II See Appendices VI, VII, and VIII.
    The political advantages  of the  occupation  are fully described also  in thememorandum by the Political  Department, India Office (see Appendix VI), whereinit is pointed out that          &quot;. . .  .  it appears to be of  primary importance for the maintenance of our    prestige in the East that we should get full value out of our military achievements    wherever possible.  If we stop  short  of  Bagdad the  political  effect  of our    victorious  advance into  Mesopotamia will be largely discounted.  The effect of    our halting will undoubtedly be ascribed to weakness.&quot;    4. Though the Committee are unanimously in favour of the occupation of Bagdad,which, according to General Sir John Nixon, would not at present entail much difficulty,they are of opinion  that the capture  of the city followed  by retirement  would havean  adverse political effect outweighing the advantages to be gained  by occupation.Eor this reason  the Committee&quot; are opposed  to any  idea  of  a  temporary militaryoccupation.    5. On military  grounds the  capture and  occupation of Bagdad offer  distinctand solid advantages.  The  enemy, apart from the  blow which  his  prestige wouldsustain, would be deprived of an important trade centre, a valuable depot, a base, and arailhead (of the section of the Bagdad railway now working from Samarra to Bagdad).Our forces would be astride the main route from Europe- through  Kermanshah tothe interior of  Persia, and would deprive  the Germans of a base for their intriguesin the Middle East.The Practicability of  an Advance.    &apos;6. The General Staff, War Office, the Commander-in-Chief in India, the MilitarySecretary, India Office, and the local military authorities are all in agreement in theopinion,  in which the Committee  concur,  that  the  British forces at  present inMesopotamia, though apparently adequate for the  capture of  Bagdad, are notsufficient to ensure its retention, which is regarded as essential.   General Sir  JohnNixon has stated that if the Turks should turn their serious attention to the recoveryof Bagdad, and  should  send  to Mesopotamia  the large organised forces that wouldbe  needed  for  such  an operation, he would require  one division and  one  Britishcavalry regiment in  addition to his  present force.    The  Committee  consider thata  force  not less than this  is  immediately necessary to hold  Bagdad,  but theythink that two regiments of Indian cavalry might be substituted if a British  cavalry-regiment is not available.  It is essential that these troops should reach Basra at theearliest  possible  date, as their presence  will be required  at  Bagdad to ensure  itsoccupation against attempts on the part of the Turks  to re-take the city.  For thisreason the Committee have recommended that the reinforcements should begin toarrive at Basra within four weeks of the issue of orders for the advance.     In order to provide for possible eventualities, a second  division, or those units ofa division  which can be suituably  employed in Mesopotamia,  should  be held  inreadiness to follow the first as soon as required.  In the event of the Turks being ina position  later on to concentrate forces from distant  quarters on the  Upper Tigris,with the object of - offensive operations on a large scale, even these two divisions mayprove insufficient, and it may be necessary in 1916 to send further reinforcements.    7. It is understood that the existing numbers of vessels on the Tigris is sufficientto enable this advance to be  made and  to ensure the supply of the advanced troops.The flotilla of  shallow-draught  gunboats  now  under  construction  will  eventuallybe  an important addition to the offensive power of General Nixon&apos;s force, and willgreatly  contribute to the safety of  the communications  by  river.   It  is alsounderstood that  the transport  over sea of these troops to the Persian Gulf  can  beundertaken by the Admiralty.    8. If we are to gain the greatest possible advantages, both political and military,from  an advance to Bagdad, a very early decision on the matter should be made.  Thesooner Bagdad is in our hands the greater will be the effect.
CONCLUSIONS.     [These are given seriatim, and are numbered according to the headings of the                               Terms of Reference.]     1.  THE Committee consider that, both on military and political grounds, an early advance upon and  occupation  of Bagdad is most  desirable ; but  that, unless  the Expeditionary Eorce now in Mesopotamia can be so reinforced that it can maintain its position after reaching Bagdad, no attempt should be made either to seize or occupy that city.     The immediate reinforcements necessary for the  retention of Bagdad are  at least the equivalent of one infantry division of the  Indian Army  and one or two regiments of cavalry.  It is essential^ if an advance on Bagdad be decided on, that reinforcements of this  strength should at once be definitely assigned  to Mesopotamia, and that they should without fail begin to arrive at Basra within four weeks of the issue of the orders for the  advance.     The Committee are of opinion that these reinforcements  cannot be furnished from the garrison in India.     If  reinforcements on  the scale mentioned above  cannot be provided,  and if, notwithstanding, the Indian Government  are satisfied that General Nixon can defeat the enemy forces immediately fronting him, and that on military and other grounds an action is desirable, they should be  allowed to  give him the necessary permission to attack,  but only on  the clear understanding that he is not to attempt to  enter or occupy  Bagdad.     2.  From the information before the Committee, there would appear to be no purely defensive position  near Bagdad of  any great  strength.   But it is thought that  the Bagdad district, if occupied by a sufficient force,  offers  considerable strategic  advan- tages.     3.  Without  Bagdad  and the surrounding district as a base, the Turks could still assemble considerable forces and undertake offensive  operations.  But with Bagdad in&apos; their possession  they would be much more favourably situated both for the concentra- tion of force and the  assumption of the offensive.    4. From  their  imperfect  knowledge of  events  in other theatres of war   the Committee are unable to foresee with any certainty the effect which a British  occupa- tion of Bagdad would have  on the Turkish forces engaged against the Russians  and against  ourselves in the Dardanelles.    Though the capture by us of Bagdad would undoubtedly be an inducement to  the Turks  to  withdraw  force  from other quarters in  the hope of  retaking  that city, the extent to which they would be able to do this would depend on events elsewhere. The Committee  accept the  estimate of the General  Staff that the  Turks might in certain circumstances have  60,000  men at their  disposal, but consider  that,  even if this number of men were available, it would be a very  difficult operation to concentrate them  in Mesopotamia and  undertake  offensive  operations  if  Bagdad  were  in our possession.

APPENDIX I.FOKMER  OFFICIAL TELEGRAMS  BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA AND    THE VICEROY RELATING TO THE  OPERATIONS BY THE  FORCE  UNDER GENERAL    SIR  JOHN NIXON.                _                                      (1)-      From the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, Army Department,                                 April 24, 1915.    1812.  Your PL 4416.  With, reference to Nixon&apos;s request for a cavalry  brigadeI concur in your decision, as apart from impossibility of complying, the approach ofhot season renders despatch of more troops, especially British, unadvisable.    Nixon&apos;s demand implies intention on his part of important  offensive movement.I presume he clearly understands that Government will not sanction at this momentany advance beyond present theatre of operations.  We must confine ourselves duringsummer to defence of Basra Vilayat and oil interests in Arabistan.   If after smashingenemy in Karun direction it is possible to advance to Amara with view to establishingan outpost which will control  tribesmen between there and Karun, and so contributeto security of pipe-line there, I  should be prepared to accept such a proposal, providedit is supported by you,  but I deprecate any  plan involving undue extension andpossible demands  for reinforcements.    Strategically our  present position is a soundone, and at present we cannot afford to take risks by unduly exteuding it.  We mustplay a safe game in Mesopotamia.                                      (2.)        From the Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India, August 5, 1915.    No. JEL. 6793.   Your telegram  of  the  30th ultimo, No. 1797.  These questionshave been under close and constant consideration for months past, and Nixon&apos;s views,originally called for on the 19th June, and furnished in his despatch of the 24th June,have again been asked for on your above-mentioned telegram.    His  reply  puts  the  case so clearly  that  we repeat it as our answer to yourtelegram:          &quot;Referring to your telegram  of the 31st ultimo, No. S. 16,700.   The views    expressed  by  the Secretary of  State  are  practically identical  with those I     submitted in my secret despatch, dated 24th June, and with  instructions  I have    given to  General Gorringe.         &quot; In my despatch I emphasised the advantage of holding  Kut-al-Amarah in    force and  the unlikelihood  of  Nasiriyah being then  threatened by Euphrates    line, and the  consequent possibility of reducing the strength of  the Nasiriyah    garrison.         &quot; With regard to the suggested total evacuation on the Nasiriyah, I am all    in favour of concentrating on  the Tigris  line, but I consider that Nasiriyah is    too important a place to abandon altogether, as it  must be a centre of civil    government to control the powerful Arab  tribes  by which it is surrounded, and    effectually to occupy this vilayet.         &quot; A  withdrawal  from Nasiriyah would do incalculable harm  politically on    this account;  Ajaimi would reappear with a few Turks  to re-establish Turkish    authority, and all tribes would get out of hand.         &quot;According to  information  at  my  disposal, ^asiriyah  is less unhealthy    than Basra or Qurnah, and in a short  time the  climate will be quite good.  The    land  communications of Nasiriyah are bad, but they could  be improved by a
     railway.   On  this point I hope to address you very shortly, the matter having     been under investigation for many weeks.         &quot; The water communications of Nasiriyah are difficult  during the present     low-water season, but now that we  are  established in Nasiriyah and  the enemy     have been driven off, these difficulties are by no means insuperable, and  plentiful     supplies are obtainable locally in this district, while country boats of our contractors     pass through the Hammar Lake freely.         &quot; When the 18th Brigade returns from the Nasiriyah Force it will join its     division at Amarah, and the 6th Division will then have two brigades at Amarah     and another brigade at Ali-al-Gharbi and its communications.         &quot;When Nasiriyah can be reduced to strength proposed, viz., one brigade, the     reserve at Basra will be one  brigade, and  the 3rd  Brigade, 12th Division, will be     on communications from Basra to Qalat Salih inclusive.         &quot;If Kut  is occupied  I propose to leave four battalions  at  Amarah, and     after  placing  detachments at two  or three posts,  quarter &quot;two infantry  brigades     in Kut.        &quot; I would point out that it is  only by occupying Kut that the reduction of     troops at Amarah is possible.   I have no intention  of making any dash  on  Kut;     the advance will be made methodically.        &quot;At  present  General  Delamain&apos;s Column  has cleared  the  river up to     Ali-al-Gharbi,  but has orders not to  proceed beyond.        &quot;As regards Ahwaz and the supposed necessity to guard the pipe-line with     troops, I have  carefully considered the question and have given my views at some     length, vide papers forwarded wdth my 304/4/0 of the 19th June, and my (telegram)     of the 27th June 304/5/0 and subsequent correspondence.        &quot; But the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will not arrange for a  subsidy  while     the Indian Government is ordered to keep troops at Ahwaz for ever, and it is not     easy to withdraw troops, because the Anglo-Persian Oil  Company wdll  not give     suhsidv, and this creates deadlock.        &quot; In this connection I would reiterate  that,  if suitable arrangements be  made     wdth tribesmen, I see no military reason for prolonged retention of  troops on the     Karun Une unless hostility is to be expected on the part of the Persian  Govern-     ment, in wduch case I should require very strong reinforcements if it is required     to hold  the oil fields against any possible combination  of  Bakhtiaris and  other    tribes.&quot;    We concur in Nixon&apos;s views, and propose  to  authorise him to  advance on  Kutwhen he is ready.     So far as we are aware, Nixon knows  nothing about the proposal to re-inforcehim temporarily with the  28th Brigade, and has always believed his present  Forcecapable of effecting the occupation of Kut  so long as he received drafts to fill up hisBritish battalions and he wras not required to  disseminate troops along the pipe-line.We concur in his views.

APPENDIX II. RECENT  OEFICIAL TELEGRAMS BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OE  STATE FOR INDIA, THE     VICEROY,  AND   GENERAL  SIR   JOHN   NIXON,  RELATING TO   THE  LATTER&apos;S     ADVANCE IN MESOPOTAMIA.                                       (1-)             From General Sir John Nixon, Basra, September 29, 1915.     (Addressed to Chief of General Staff; repeated to Secretary of State,  Foreign,              Inspector-General of Communications, and 12th  Division.)     308/172/0, 29/9/15.  Continuation  of my 129/195/1 of 29th.  Last night, 28th, Delamain when moving to attack rear of enemy&apos;s position became aware  of strong Turkish reinforcements marching parallel to him.   He attacked and routed these after severe fighting lasting till,  dark,  capturing four guns       [corrupt group] casualties were  1,200.  Enemy&apos;s  main position  Avas found  unoccupied early  this morning.   A,eroplane reconnaissance shows Turks in flight by  river and road towards Bagdad, our cavalry entering Kat, river column moving in pursuit.   Regret to report gallant officer, Lieutenant Commander  E. C. Cookson, R.N., senior naval officer, Avas killed last night in gunboat attack on  river obstruction  while personally engaged in cutting wire.  The naval gunboats had been handled by him with greatest daring and effect during two days&apos; operations.                                       (2.)             From General Sir John Nixon, Basra, September 29, 1915.

The pursuit of the defeated Turkish forces Avas taken up early morning 29th by naval gunboats and our cavalry.  General Townshend follows Avith the leading infantry  brigade in  ships (?) 30th.  Enemy&apos;s  troops Avere  seen byaeroplane morning 29th retreating in  column  1  miles long up left bank  Tigris about10  miles above Sukkkmt (?) as crow flies.  Aeroplane also dropped bombs  on largesteamer believed  to  be &quot; Khalifa,&quot; which at once  made for bank and is believed to have been injured.  One brigade is clearing  up battlefield.   Total prisoners  captured by us up to date 1,650,;  more coming in.  Inspection  of captured position showsdefences have been designed and constructed on the  latest and most approved principlesand  Avith  remarkable  thoroughness and  study of detail.   Communication  trenchesextended for miles, ranges marked by flags,  arrangements Avere  made  for embarkingtroops and covering their retirement.  There was  an elaborate system  of observationand  contact mines.  A number of these were exploded by  our Engineers  withoutaccident, but severe casualties  were caused  by mines during action.  The field of fire was everyAvhere flat and open.  JSur-ed-din&apos;s force during late battle consisted of six squadrons cavalry, twenty-six guns and 35th, 38th.Infantry  battalions  plus certainother formations  aggregating some.four extra battalions.  His total force is estimated to have been some 7,000 to  8,000  regular troops  assisted by  considerable number of tribesmen.   General head-quarters  are  1 mile (town  stream  of Kut(?)

Personal  inspection  on  29th of enemy&apos;s  position, described in my  129/196/1, greatly impressed me  Avith skilful  plan  of its capture
 adopted by Major-General Townshend in bis attack on 28th.   I am convinced that his scheme of turning the Turkish left and  getting in the rear  of the centre  of the position was the only manoeuvre whereby the enemy could be dislodged without our incurring enormous &quot;losses.   Any scheme entailing  direct assault of  any portion of line would have inevitably proved most costly.  Three air reconnaissances from Kut have located the retreating Turkish force as follows : Cavalry advanced guard of main column was at 1 P.M. on Tigris right bank on point (sheet 2 B, square B 22, 2 2 1), and cavalry  rearguard  on  point (B 2 5 6).   Rearguard has  two guns  with  it. One enemy steamer  was seen, apparently in difficulties, close to Baglinkah.  Our pursuit on 30th has been dogged with persistent bad luck.  One of our three gun- boats has  stuck in shoal eight miles up-stream of Kut, and although foot channel in vicinity of Kut was reconnoitred on night of  29th-30th, shifting sandbanks held our river column throughout the daylight hours on 30th, and it was  not tiU dusk that ships were got through.   Our cavalry have, however,  pushed  ahead, and river column proceed up-stream from Kut at daylight 1st October.   Remainder of division concen- trate at Kut as  soon as circumstances permit.  Report just  received  from  naval gunboats states &quot; Samana&quot; aground eight miles above Kut, with steering gear  badly damaged.   &quot; Shaitan &quot; and &quot; Comet&quot;  at 10 A.M. xOth  arrived point (sheet 2 H, C 238), and engaged Turkish steamer &quot; Busrah &quot; aground at C 237 at range of  6,500  yards. &quot; Busrah &quot; replied with four guns,  but was  apparently hit and  at one time on fire. Pioneers returned to assist, and got her off.  Gunboats then chased, but were fired on from C 208 at 11 A.M. by two guns of cavalry raiding party under Subri Bey returning from Sheikh Saad.  Gunboats carried  on, and  came  up with  two boat-loads  of ammunition abandoned  by &quot; Busrah,&quot; but getting into difficulties  at  bad crossing returned to avoid being caught aground by Subri.  They  got back safely, and observed Turks being hotly attacked by Arabs.  One gunboat  is  standing by  &quot; Samana,&quot; but others returned here to  report, and will lead  Townshend&apos;s river column 1st October.

Aircraft reconnaissance  by Major Reilly,  morning ofthe 3rd October, observed both right and left bank infantry columns of the  enemy tobe within 20 miles of Sulman Pak.  The enemy&apos;s three paddlers had reached SulmanPak, and the reconnaissance observed partly prepared position there astride of Tigris.In  vicinity  of position was considerable camp  which is  judged to contain threeTabours and four guns lately moved from the Euphrates line,  plus a reinforcementof four Tabours and four  guns  from  Mosul.   It is  therefore most probable thatNur-ed-din will stand and fight at Sulman Pak.   Our river  column  is now only atShidhaif  Ash Sharqi,  and  no chance of surprising or stampeding their remainders.  Iconsider  I  am  strong  enough  to  open road  to Bagdad,  and  with this  intentionI propose to concentrate at A.ziziyah.   But this concentration must  be partly byland.

Navigation  difficulties have been overcome by lightening  ships andutilising them for towing laden barges and by marching troops with land  transport.The  16th  Brigade with all field artillery left this  morning for Aziziyah by road,preceded by Headquarters Cavalry Brigade with three guns, &quot; S &quot; Battery, and lOOlances.Cavalry has orders to reach Aziziyah evening of the  7th.   Enemy appears to be nolonger  retreating, but has  occupied  Ctesiphon position  and thereby constitutes  athreat  to us.   Our information is that&apos;his  troops, especially those  locally recruited,have been much demoralised by defeat  at Kut-al-Arnara, a position which they con-sidered impregnable.  They are now so near Bagdad that Nur-ud-din will have difficultyin making a determined stand with men who are close to  their homes and  wish todesert.   I consider, therefore, that there is every probability of catching and smashingthe enemy at Ctesiphon as soon as the 6th Division has fully concentrated at Aziziyah,and has been reinforced by drafts of cavalry now on  their way from Basra.  If, onthe other hand, we retire from Aziziyah to Kut-al-Amara, the enemy and whole of thetribes will piace their own construction on such a move, and advance on Kut-al-Amaraas he did on Amara in July last, when troops were withdrawn from post above Amarain order to reinforce General Gorringe on iNasiriyali line.   Then a powerful  section ofthe  tribes who had  already &quot;Submitted to us  rejoined the Turks, and  has been  acontinual source of trouble  until  British prestige was re-established by the  victory atKut-al-Amara.  The  Arab tribes  now regard us as irresistible, and have been comingin from all  directions to make submission ; but if we withdraw will probablyJbehaveas before.    It  is my view that we have in front of us a shaken enemy who  has lost  13 gunsand is  deficient of ammunition, and  for  military  reasons it  is clearly desirable tosmash him while Ave can.   He has taken refuge in a position where we can manoeuvreand I  hope destroy him.   I see  nothing  which wrould justify letting slip such anopportunity.  Erom  a military point of viewr Bagdad is a focus  of Turkish  lines ofadvance and a large supply centre, of  which, in our interests, it is vital to deprive theenemy, and this quite apart from any political effect its occupation might  have.

In  view  of  German  activities in Persia,increasing pressure on Afghanistan, and  the  aspect in the Balkans and Dardanelles,we hold that the  capture of Bagdad would have such an effect in the Near East andoffers such important political and strategical advantages as to justify movement, butto do this at least an additional  division would he required.

Our estimate  of present strength  of  enemy in Mesopotamia  is  8,500 rifles,600 sabres, and 28  guns, under command of Nur-ud-din.   Of the above, 7 battalions,amounting to approximately 3,500  rifles  with 8 guns, are at or near Sulman Pak, andhave not been engaged  against us.  They include 4 battalions and 4 guns  recentlyarrived from Mosul.   Force under Hussain  Raouf Bey, which was near Qasr-i-Shirin.may also shortly be at Sulman Pak.

From the Secretary of State to the Viceroy, October 5, 1915.    Private.   My private  telegram of 4th  instant.  Nixon&apos;s advance.  Cabinet, towhom position was reported yesterday, decided to appoint Committee of General Staff,Admiralty, Foreign and India Offices to consider in all its aspects possibility and policyof advance on Bagdad.  Political reasons were thought to make occupation desirableas isolating Germans in Persia, if forces available are sufficient to take and hold theplace.  Barrow thinks we might be able to capture Bagdad, but that forces weakenedby further losses would be insufficient both to  hold it securely against counter attackand to maintain communications.  Kitchener can hold out no hope of reinforcementsfrom  Europe or  Egypt.  Let me know your views.   It  was suggested that Japanshould be asked to send a division.

Please  see -official telegram of  to-day.    Orders  were telegraphed yesterday  to Nixon to stopfurther advance.  Present situation is as  follows.   Nixon with forces at his disposalcould without much difficulty capture Bagdad, and at the same time take or destroyTurkish steamers and other boats, thus  practicaUy preventing any further attacksdown stream.  But he could not remain there exposed to attack by Turkish reinforce-ments from  Mosul or Aleppo without himself being reinforced by one  division oftroops.  It would be a grave political error to advance  to Bagdad and  to  retire laterunder pressure from the Turks.  Consequently, unless it be possible to  reinforceNixon from elsewhere other than from India, he must remain at Kut-el-Amara.  Onthe other  hand, from a political  point  of vieAv, capture of Bagdad would create animmense impression in  Middle East, especially in Persia, Afghanistan, and on ourfrontier, and  wrould counteract unfortunate impression created by want of success inDardanelles.   It would also isolate German  parties in  Persia,  probably  producepacincating effect in that country, and frustrate German  plan of raising Afghanistanand the tribes, while impression throughout  Arabia  would be striking.  In  Indiaeffect would undoubtedly be good.  These are considerations to which I attach  greatimportance, but I put them forward to be  weighed by you and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, for I fully realise that  it is for His  Majesty&apos;s Government to decide where andhow our forces can be used with the best possible effect.

Sir John Nixon&apos;s plans.Commander-in-Chief agrees with view contained in my private telegram of yesterdaythat it would  be  unwise to  occupy Bagdad with our present forces.   As regardssuggested employment of Japanese troops, I am  not enthusiastic over the idea, andfeefthere are very grave objections on the  ground of prestige and popular sentimentin the East.  Moreover, stringent conditions would be essential if they were employedin Mesonotamia.   But I feel  strongly that we have got to win  this war, and thatdifficulties and  existing prejudices may  have to give to attainment of this object.What I would greatly prefer is that our own troops in Egypt should  be released forMesopotamia and replaced by  Japanese troops.  There would be an obvious reason forthis in that they would be protecting one of the great waterways  of the world in thesecurity of  which they have an important interest.

Reference to my telegram of to-day to Nixon repeatedto you.  Cabinet are so impressed  with great political  and military advantages ofoccupation  of Bagdad that we shall make every effort to supply necessary force.   Wedo not wish to attempt it with insufficient forces.  Are you satisfied that one divisionis sufficient ?                                      (6.)            From the Viceroy to the Secretary of State, October 9, 1915.    Private.  Your private telegram of the 8th instant, and Nixon&apos;s telegram to you,No. 308, of the same date.   I am glad of  the decision of Cabinet.   After consultingthe Commander-in-Chief, I think that Nixon is in the best position to judge as to thenumber  of  troops  required, and when  he  mentions a  division   we understandhim  to  mean  a  fully-organised  division  with its  proper  proportion of  Britishtroops  and guns and  its  divisional  cavalry.    In addition to this he asks for acavalry  regiment.   We  are prepared  to accept  his  opinion, but think  that itwill also be necessary to ensure that British units now  with  him  are kept up tostrength by drafts from home, as India cannot supply these.  We will keep the Indianunits full.  We may add that reinforcing troops should reach Bagdad not later thanone month after its capture, as this is the period which we calculate must elapse beforethe Turks could concentrate in strength to attempt its recapture.APPENDIX  IV.MEMORANDUM BY GENERAL SIR  E.  BARROW, MILITARY SECRETARY, INDIA OFFICE.                 The Mesopotamia Question in its Military Aspect.    The victory at Kut-el-Amara is of so complete a nature that the idea of pushing onto Bagdad will certainly be revived.   Pressure will be brought on us, either directlyby Sir John Nixon and Sir Percy Cox, who primd facie are in the best position to judgeot its feasibility, or indirectly by an agitation in the press or in commercial circles. Itmay even be urged, and there is much force in the argument, that it is advisable onpolitical grounds  on account of  the world-wide prestige  which the occupation ofBagdad would confer. Certainlyistrong arguments can be advanced for its occupation,
and the case with which the operation can be carried out will be impressed on us withsuch cogency and insistence that the proposal will be difficult to resist.  The veryglamour attaching to so historic a city is in itself a temptation, and it is wdth extremerel uctance that I advocate a policy of caution, which wdll certainly be unpopular, andperhaps  difficult to  justify in the minds  of those who are not  intimate with theintricacies of the problem.    The  force  under  General -Nixon  comprises  two  divisions  of  infantry  and abrigade  of  cavalry.  This force occupies a  considerable  area in  the midst  of adoubtful and possibly  hostile population.  It also has to  protect important Britishinterests  in the Anglo-Persian  oilfields  as  well  as  at  Bushire and  Basra.  Theconsequence is it cannot be concentrated.    The following  may be regarded as a reasonable,  if not  almost  an obligatoryminimum distribution of the troops :          At Bushire, Ahwaz, Basra 1 brigade, 1 regiment of cavalry.         At Nasiriyah and Kurna 1 brigade.         At Amara and Kut-el-Amara 1 brigade, 1 cavalry regiment.    This leaves  available for further operations towards Bagdad  only one infantrydivision and two cavalry regiments.    Such a force  may be sufficient to expel the Turks  from Bagdad.  That is aquestion wdiich can only be answered by General Nixon on  local information, but theproblem  does not end at the capture  of  Bagdad.  The city  wdll absorb a garrison ofat  least  a  brigade.   This  leaves  us only two weak  brigades to  cope with anyeventuality that may arise.   I put the strength of  the  force that might possibly  beavailable for operations outside Bagdad at:          5,000 infantry, i.e., 2 brigades,          800 cavalry, i-e., 8 squadrons,           22 guns,            1 company sappers and  miners,wdiich is probably  sufficient to deal with  any local disturbances that  may arise inthe Bagdad Vilayet,  though even from  this force  we may have to make obligatorydetachments.  For instance, we may be compelled to find a garrison for the railheadat Samarra on the Tigris, 70 miles  from Bagdad, and perhaps  another on the  highroad to Persia via Khanikin ; consequently I do not  think we can  count on having amobile force of  more than 4,000 or at the most 5,000 men all told  for employment inadvance of Bagdad.    This to  my mind is insufficient.    The  debris of the Mesopotamian Army Corps wdll probably retire towards Mosul,and if they were  hereafter say, three months hence reinforced by  a  TurkishDivision either from  the Caucasus or  Syria, our reduced division of 5,000 men wouldhave a  formidable  task to resist the  enemy&apos;s  advance.   If it were  supported oydisaffected Arabs or a religious rising  we might have to evacuate Bagdad and retire toour present strong strategical  position at the junction of the Tigris and Shatt-el-Hai.Such a sequel to the occupation of Bagdad would reverberate through the East fromConstantinople to Delhi, and might have a disastrous political effect far outweighingthe credit we would  nowr acquire by its capture.  The Arabs along our  line of retreatwould certainly rise against us, and our communications would probably be threatenedall along the Tigris as far as Kurna.  Whereas if we sit tight at Kut-el-Amara we canconsolidate our control  of the Basra Vilayet and fortify a strong position  at the apexof the triangle formed by the Tigris and Shatt-el-Hai which with our naval commandof the rivers would be unassailable by any but a very superior force accompanied byheavy artillery while it would at the  same time completely cover the main approachesto the territory now occupied by us.  By such a military policy we  can ensure ourpresent hold of  the  country with the troops  now at our disposal, whereas under themore ambitious and alluring Bagdad policy we should be weak everywhere and unableTO maintain our  position without a considerable addition to our present strength.    In my  judgment it will not be wdse to go to  Bagdad unless we can increase theforce  by  a whole Division of Infantry and one or two Cavalry regiments, and this weknow is impracticable unless the Indian troops are withdrawn from France.    The conclusion of  the  whole matter therefore  is that we cannot  under presentcircumstances  go  to Bagdad without  incurring   unjustifiable risks.  It must beremembered that during the winter the Russians are not likely to be able to make any
 advance into Armenia, and consequently the Turks can very well spare a division or two  from  the  Armenian army at  this  season  to  reinforce  the  Mesopotamian tioop^ ^  not-know what may now be the strength of the Mesopotamian force, but we have been told of a Brigade which  was recently at  Kifu and is now retiring to Bagdad, and presumably there is a Bagdad garrison apart from the force beaten at Kut-el-Amara,  so probably, not counting  Arabs, the Turks  can still muster some 10,000 men  at or near Bagdad.   If we go to Bagdad and the enemy retires to Samarra, they may  very possibly be reinforced there by another 10,000  men  or  more from Armenia,  and yet another reinforcement from Aleppo,&apos;9 so I greatly doubt whether we can hold Bagdad for any length of time with our present force.    We have practically no reserve to depend  on and we must play a safe game and husband our sorely strained military resources.    I have felt it my  duty to place these considerations before  the Secretary of State because everything points to our hands being forced, unless we can arrest  the present trend of events by a prompt and imperative decision.    Kut-el-Amara is only about 120 miles by road  from Bagdad, although by river it is 220  miles,  and General Nixon&apos;s advance  guard,  in  boats,  has already covered some 20 miles of that distance.   I see no  indication of a  halt in the pursuit, though in the present state of the river  I also see no probability of being  able to overtake the  enemy.  If we do not stop him, General Nixon will soon be in Bagdad regardless of orders,  and we shall  then  be faced by  the  grave alternative  of either  having to withdraw  again  or  of making  our occupation effective.   Either  course involves serious  considerations,  more  especially in  view  of the  gloomy  situation  in  the IS ear East.    Of  course, events may prove too  strong for us.  If the Turks  abandon Bagdad altogether and general anarchy  threatens the city, we may be implored to intervene by the inhabitants for their own protection.  In that case, I think occupation would be justifiable both in our own interests and on grounds of humanity, while the event would doubtless have an immense effect both in  Arabia and Persia.   So that in this particular  case I  am in favour of taking the risks  and going to  Bagdad,  though be it clearly  understood,  only if we are invited to come and  if the internal situation demands compliance.    It is  certain in such a case that the  Turks will  not be able to  attack  us  forseveral months, and in that time we  may be able to  arrange for  reinforcements, andas the inhabitants will  have committed  themselves to  our side  we may even expecttheir self-interested support.                                                                    KG. B.    October 4, 1915.APPENDIX Y.              MEMORANDUM BY THE  GENERAL STAFF, WAR OFFICE.    1.  IT is probably quite feasible for  Sir J. Nixon&apos;s  force  to advance  to andseize Bagdad.  The question is whether he would be able to remain there.    Eor reasons stated in paragraph  4  below  it  appears quite  possible for theTurks  to  assemble a very  superior  force, whose  arrival  would lead  to  activeoperations by the Arabs against our long and difficult line of communications.    It seems to us  that to  attempt to hold Bagdad, except with a force very muchlarger than Sir J. Nixon&apos;s, and with proportionately increased river transport, wouldbe to court disaster.   Even supposing that we were able to  hold it in the face of anyforce the Turks could bring against it, it is doubtful if we should be able to maintainour supply service during the months when the Tigris is low.    2.  We have not  been able to discover from maps or  reports any position inthe neighbourhood of Bagdad which  would enable us to  hold the town  or  districtagainst a  superior enemy.   Whatever  line we  took up would leave it open to theenemy  to operate against our flank and line of communications.   * Mr. Marling has since reported in telegram No. 378, dated October 4, 1915, that Jamal Pasha is saidto be leaving Syria for Bagdad with 6,000 men from the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.      [1115]                              &quot;               &apos;             F
    3. We see no reason why the Turks should not  be able to concentrate a largeforce  against us if we are holding a position at Bagdad.  In  fact  it  seems easierfor them to concentrate  against  us there than  it  would  be  at  Kut-el-Amara.There are no doubt difficulties in the Way of transport and supply, but we think thesecould be overcome.    4. The occupation of Bagdad will incite offensive action on the part of the Turks,and they are in a position to dO this without  materially endangering their situation inany other theatre of war.    The Russians in the Caucasus cannot be relied on  to  pin  down the whole of theTurkish  force how  opposed to them.  If the Turks  should  move troops from theCaucasus to Bagdad, the Russians will  more probably withdraw Caucasian troops tothe main theatre than act  offensively against the depleted Turkish force.  We arguethus from past experience when the Dardanelles  operations were initiated.    The Turks, knowing that our hands are full  and that we are withdrawing troopsfrom Gallipoli to the Balkans, can reduce their forces in Syria-Palestine, Hejaz andAsyr-Djemil could probably move 20,000 troops in this way from Syria to Mesopotamia,and 20,000 could easily be spared from the Gallipoli.  The Russian inactivity in theCaucasus makes it quite feasible for  the Turks  to  spare 15,000 or 20,000 from thatfront, especially in winter time.    It, therefore, will become possible for 60,000 Turks  to be assembled from thethree  districts mentioned above, and to be conveyed in the course of  some weeks toBagdad.  The occupation of Bagdad by British troops would  impress  the  Orientalmind  not only in Turkey, but also in Persia and India, and re-establish some of theprestige which we have lost by our failure to force the Dardanelles.    Ifj however, we are unable to hold Bagdad when  60,000 fresh troops assemble toco-operate with Turkish  troops  at  present  in  Mesopotamia,  our withdrawal fromBagdad  might have as great and as unfortunate an effect  on the Mohammedan worldas our withdrawal from the Gallipoli Peninsula.    October  6, 1915.APPENDIX VI.MEMORANDUM BY THE POLITICAL DEPARTMENT, INDIA  OFFICE.                   Advance to Bagdad :  Political Considerations.     Sir Percy Cox, in a recent  telegram  (27th  September, 1915) expressed  the viewthat the fall of Constantinople or Bagdad were the only events likely to affect  thesituation in  Persia.   The fall  of Constantinople appears, unfortunately, to  be moreremote  than ever; but Bagdad is within our grasp, and  its early occupation wouldapparently  present little  military  difficulty, and  could be  accomplished withoutreinforcing the troops under Sir John Nixons command.     There can be little question that the occupation, by British troops of the ancientseat of the Khalifate would  produce an immense impression, not only in Persia,  hutthroughout the Middle East.   Orientals are impressed by tangible success, wdiich  canbe  measured in square miles  and demonstrated on the map, much  more  than bynegative results, however brilliant  or important, such  as our armies  have achieved inthe  West.   Thus the conquest of  German  South-West  Africa, to judge from  thecongratulatory messages and accounts of public rejoicings  which have reached  theIndia Office, caused much  more stir in India, where it  represented  the first solidachievement of British arms after months of  uncertainty, than it aroused in Englandwhere  the  relative unimportance of the event was  better appreciated.  During  thepresent  wrar, our  enemies have achieved  this  kind of tangible success  in manydirections ;  we have done so in two theatres only, viz., Mesopotamia and South-WestAfrica,  and have  conspicuously failed in a third region where events have beenwatched with paramount interest throughout the Middle East.  Sir  G. Roos Keppelrecently bore testimony to the  effect produced by the fall  of  Warsaw, and  Germanvictories in Bussia,  upon the  tribesrnen of  the North.-West,  Frontier, where   theimpression  of  South-West Africa-our one decided success in  local  estimation-isbeginning to fade.
    In  these  circumstances it appears to he of primary importance  for the main-tenance of our prestige in the  East, that we should get full value out of our militaryachievements wherever possible.   If we stop  short of Bagdad, the political  effect ofour victorious advance  into Mesopotamia will be largely discounted.  The fact of ourhalting when the whole world expects us to  go  on, will undoubtedly be ascribed toweakness.  We shall be regarded as having &quot; shot our bolt,&quot; and so far from seeingan end to our difficulties in  Persia, we shall leave the Persians more firmly convincedthan ever that they have nothing to fear from us, and can afford to ignore our interestsand disregard our advice. Everywhere our friends will be discouraged and our enemieswill gain confidence, and the decisive blow, which is to set  us right in the eyes of  theEast, will remain unstruck.   What prospect is there of its being struck in any othertheatre of war in the near future?    Apart from more general considerations, the occupation of  Bagdad will  bring usone very definite strategical advantage, viz.,  control over the  Bagdad-Kermanshahroute, which is the sole channel by which the  Germans in Persia can communicatewith the outside world. We know from  recent reports that the Germans themselvesattach the utmost importance to the maintenance of this line of communication, whichis vital to their position in Persia and to their projects  in Afghanistan.   Mr. Marlingtelegraphed from Tehran on the 1st October :          &quot; All reports show  that the Germans are bringing in very  considerable quan-    tities of arms and  ammunition via Kermanshah to Ispahan, and that practically    the whole  of the Turkish force under Raouf Pasha  that  has been  waiting at    Saripul has been brought surreptitiously to Kermanshah, where  German Vice-    Gonsul is said to have also some 1,100 tribesmen in his pay.   This may indicate    an attempt to reach Afghanistan with a considerable force.&quot;    The danger  here  indicated  is a  real one.   The Amir  has hitherto behavedadmirably, in the face  of  much adverse  pressure; but it is  impossible to  say whatwould be the effect upon him of the arrival on the Afghan frontier of armed Turco-German forces  in considerable numbers.   If he gave way, and proclaimed jihad (ashe has long been urged to  do), we should have the North-West Frontier in a  blaze,and might have to undertake  operations which would strain our military resources tobreaking point.   If  we close the  Kermanshah-Bagdad  route and isolate the Germans,we place it beyond their power to operate  against us on any considerable scale eitherin Persia or Afghanistan.    The political advantages tp be anticipated  from the  occupation of Bagdad arethus two-fold :     (1.)  It will revive  British prestige in the Middle East; and    (2.)  It will place  us in  a position to cut  the  German line of communicationwith Persia,    Once the occupation is  a fait accompli, we may fairly expect a rapid improvementin the present  highly  unsatisfactory situation in Persia, and  an easy solution of thevarious  problems (defence  .of oil-fields, &amp;c), with which  we  are  confronted in thatcountry. The danger of jihad on the North-West Frontier will  be greatly  lessened,and the belief in our ultimate victory greatly strengthened both within and beyondour own borders.    These objects are clearly worth risking something to attain.   The question is howmuch risk we are justified  in taking.  In the case of Bagdad the accomplishment ofour immediate object presents no serious  military difficulties.  We can be certain ofour coup de theatre, whatever subsequent embarrassments may follow in its wake.Retreat from  Bagdad  would doubtless  have most unfortunate results; but  retreatfrom our present  position at Kut-el-Amara (which surely  is not outside the  range ofpossibility in  certain eventualities) would from  the political  point of view be almostequally  disastrous.  In any case, it must presumably be some  months-in the mostunfavourable event before the Turks  could collect  sufficient troops seriously tothreaten our position at Bagdad.  In the  interval, events may have happened else-where  to ease  the  situation, or  we may  be in  a better position  than at present toreinforce Sir J. Nixon&apos;s army/    We are bound  to  take risks, whether we go to Bagdad  or stay where  we are.Either course may, conceivably, land us  in embarrassing or even disastrous conse-quences. But  as a choice  has to  be made, political considerations appear  to pointdecidedly towards the adoption of the bolder course.      [1115]                                                            G
    It  may be  true  that we  can  take up  a position  at Kut-el-Amara whichmay be locally impregnable.  But if  the Turco-Germans  can put into the field aforce  capable  of  turning  us out  of Bagdad, it seems probable that the same forcewill be able, even if we do not occupy Bagdad, to produce a condition, of affairs inMesopotamia and Persia  that will necessitate withdrawal from  Kut-el-Amara.  Ifthat is so there is nothing to choose between the two, and the question is not whetherKut is more defensible  than Bagdad, but  what reasonable probability is there of theTurks being able to release a force sufficient for their purpose ?    October 6, 1915.APPENDIX VII.                     MEMORANDUM BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE.    AN advance to Bagdad may be regarded from the political or Foreign Office pointof view as of the very greatest  importance, not only on account of the situation inAsiatic Turkey, for reasons which wdll be shown at the end of this memorandum, butmore especially wdth  regard to  the present critical situation in Persia and even inAfghanistan.   It  will be wdthin the recollection  of  the Committee that recently  HisMajesty&apos;s  Minister  at Tehran felt compelled actually to raise the question of thepossibility of  having to leave that capital on account of the attitude and behaviour ofthe Germans, and their acts of terror.    Two  to  three  hundred  armed Germans,   Austrians,   and  paid   ruffians,congregated in the neighbourhood of Ispahan,  so  intimidated that town that  theconsuls of the Allied Powers evacuated the place  and withdrew elsewhere.  In Shirazthe British vice-consul was shot, and  died of his wounds, and at Bushire two Britishofficers have been killed.   In  addition to  this, the British and Bussian  consuls fromKermanshah, when about to  return to their post from Hamadan, were  threatened bythe Germans and were unable to proceed.   The means by wdiich  the  Germans hadbeen in a position to act in this wray is concisely set forth in a telegram dated the 30thultimo from  His  Majesty&apos;s  Minister  at  Tehran.  Mr.  Marling therein states asfollows:         &quot; The position of the Germans here is entirely dependent on their  being able    to keep open the  road to Bagdad via Kermanshah.  On the 29th September the    newly appointed Persian Governor of Kermanshah was informed by the  German    Minister that if he had any intention of bringing about the return of the British    and Bussian consuls, Prince B.euss would forcibly prevent the Governors own    arrival at Kermanshah, as in German interests he could not permit the possible    closing  of the only  means  of communication  wdth  the outside world  through    which the Germans  receive news and money, &amp;c.         &quot; If  the  Bussians  could  send  adequate  troops  both  to  Kazvin  and    Kermanshah  until   British troops wrere in  a position to reach  Bagdad and to,    control the Khanekin road, the Germans in Persia would be  left en Vair.         &quot; At the present time  Kermanshah is  virtually in the possession of . the    Germans.  The greater part of Turkish  regulars under Baouf, who had  hitherto    been  at Saripul, have been brought in surreptitiously to Kermanshah, where the    German  consul is busy proselytising  and may  now have altogether  some 2,000    men in his pay.&quot;    In another telegram Mr.  Marling reports that  the Germans are bringing in veryconsiderable quantities of arms and ammunition via  Kermanshah and Ispahan.    He considers that the above-mentioned action on the part of the Germans may,perhaps, indicate an attempt to reach Afghanistan with a  considerable force.    In view of these  reports, the material benefit to be obtained by an advance onBagdad-if, thereby,  as  appears probable, the German ascendancy and the Allies&apos;&quot;precarious position in Persia can  be  checked seems to render this step essential,while if no such effective action be taken, the danger to British interests in Persia andin Afghanistan may be a matter of the most serious consequence.
    A further consideration is the information which  has just come  to  hand from areliable source that  the Germans are attempting to engineer ! loan to Persia, whichif  not checked and to cut their communication at Bagdad is the only reliable meansto this end may also have disagreeable consequences to the Allies.    The occupation  of Bagdad has also been urged, ou what may be called the localor Turkish grounds,  in several  letters-received at the Poreign Office.  Among otherwriters in support of it is  Lord Inchcape, who  in his double  capacity as  a man ofbusiness, personally  well acquainted wdth the local situation and conditions, and as aformer member of the Government of India, speaks of these matters with considerableauthority.   He says :         &quot; Bagdad is the  centre of Government of the whole district, and  controls    the greater portion of the trade  passing through.  I  do  not know what action    His Majesty&apos;s Government propose taking in regard to  the extension of their    military operations beyond Basra, but I venture to express the hope that they    will  be  extended to&quot; Bagdad.  The Turkish  Government  may  naturally  be    expected to resist to  the best  of their ability the capture of Bagdad, but their    military position there is understood to be of little account.        &quot; The effect of such occupancy would weaken the power and prestige of the    Turkish  Government  throughout the whole of Arabia.  It would  place within    British control the sacred city of Kerbela, which would be particularly acceptable    to the Mahommedan population of India.        &quot; I think that I  may say without fear of contradiction that the rule of the    Turks  in Mesopotamia has always been cruel and despotic, the one  object of the    officials being the enrichment of themselves.&quot;    The  Bagdad  vilayet  includes, besides Kerbela, both Nejef and the  shrine ofSheikh Abdul Kadia, visited by Sunnis from India, and the capture of the city mightwell enable the Mahommedans of India to feel  that they were deriving  some returnfrom the war.    Sir John  Nixon&apos;s telegram  of the 5th October shows that he has achieved aconsiderable success, and that there is every prospect of the successful occupation ofBagdad if the advance is continued.    In view of the extremely important results which may be expected from such avictory both in Turkey and  in  Persia, it would seem imperative to sanction theadvance and  to supply them  with sufficient troops to render the occupation andretention of Bagdad  absolutely safe.    October 7, 1915.APPENDIX VIII.                       MEMORANDUM BY SIR L. MALLET.    MY  reason  for attaching so  much importance  to the  occupation  of  Bagdadis primarily that it is  in Mesopotamia  that we can inflict  the  maximum  damageupon Turkey at the least cost to ourselves.  I expressed this viewr in a telegram fromConstantinople dated the 2nd September, 1914.    In view of the defection of Bulgaria and the very serious situation in the Balkansit becomes  important to consider where we can recoup ourselves, and where we canbest oppose the spread of German influences in the Middle East.    The  telegrams from Mr. Marling,  and the India  Office memorandum of the6th October (see Appendix VI), show how fraught with danger is the present situation,and how  menacing to Indian interests is the prospect of complete German  dominationin Persia.  This,  in my opinion, makes the occupation of Bagdad and the consolidationof our position there against all possible eventualities, at once an immediate advantage,and at the same time a precautionary measure of urgent  importance. Although it isnot within  my competency to advise  upon such a matter, I hold the opinion that itwould be preferable, in view of  our military  resources, to  withdraw at  once fromGallipoli  and the Balkans and to concentrate our forces in Egypt and Mesopotamia.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON.-19/10/1915.
