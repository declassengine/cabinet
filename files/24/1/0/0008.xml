2 uPrinted for Hie Committee of Imperial Defence.  March 1915.SECRET.G-8.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.THE  WAR.Attack  on the Dardanelles.Note by the Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,           February 2, 1915.
/ATTACK  ON  THE  DARDANELLES.Prime Minister,     ON writing up the minutes of the three meetings (two of the War Council andone of the Sub-Committee) held last Thursday, I have been  immensely impressed withthe cumulative effect of the arguments presented in favour of military action in theDardanelles at the earliest possible date.     These  arguments  have hitherto  been  presented  singly  at intervals  in  thediscussions  of three meetings.   I  feel bound  to put them together in order to showhow overwhelming a case they produce.    Here, then, is a summary:     Russia  is the  nation upon which the Allies ought to rely mainly for the crushingblows required to bring about a decisive result.  Russia has the largest reserves ofmen, and  the eastern theatre of war gives sufficient space in which to  employ greatmasses without the inevitable siege warfare into which the fighting in  the more limitedwestern theatre degenerates.    Russia, however, lacks warlike stores  and equipment for  her masses, and herneeds can only be adequately supplied from Great Britain, France, and America.    Hitherto these supplies have only trickled in through Archangel and Vladivostock.The former port is threatened with immediate closure by ice for some months, and thelatter is at best an inadequate channel of supply.    Unless  the Dardanelles and Bosphorus  can be opened up very soon, Russia willnot receive  the supplies indispensable to an offensive campaign,  and the spring andsummer may pass by without a decisive blow being struck at Germany or Austria.    Hence the opening of  a line of communications  through the  Dardanelles andBosphorus is an indispensable military requirement in&apos;order to  liable  the Allies  totake the offensive.    In addition, there are  two secondary strategical advantages to be obtained byoperations in these waters if successful: -    (1.) The attitude of the Balkan nations now  hanging back will be  definitely           cleared up, and over 1,000,000 troops may be placed at the Allies&apos; disposal           (Roumania, 600,000; Bulgaria, 400,000; Greece, 200,000); more  if Italy           is drawn in.    (2.) A line of communication up the Danube will be provided, bringing British           sea power into the heart of the enemy&apos;s country,  and enabling  a British           army, if desired, to operate against Austria.    So much for the strategical advantages.   Now, the economic and  political advan-tages, which are of almost equal importance, must be explained.    If the Dardanelles and  Bosphorus w;ere opened     Great Britain would obtain the wdieat she requires, and the considerable amountof shipping locked up in the Black Sea.  Every expert agrees that  all  danger of ashortage of food supplies and excessive prices would  disappear.    Russia, by selling her wheat, would re-establish her exchanges,  and be able topay for  her  supplies of  war material, which4 at present she can only do with greatdifficulty and embarrassment, and by the exportation of  gold.    France would obtain the interest on her loans to  Russia, which are said to affectnearly every family in the country.    Finally, the risks  (whatever they amount  to) that the British  public  and theFrench  public may tire of the war and be  brought  by high  prices and financialstringency to desire  a premature and inconclusive peace, will be greatly reduced.   Incountries democratically governed this is a consideration that cannot be ignored.    Minor advantages, such  as the removal of the threat to the Suez Canal, the clearingup of the Persian difficulty, and the release of  Russian troops from the Caucasus  and27
__......                                        2of British troops from Egypt and perhaps Mesopotamia, are perhaps scarcely of sufficientmoment to influence the decision.    The reason why a military expedition  is mentioned  is that, as pointed out by theFirst Lord  at the Sub-Committee, the navy  can perhaps open the  Dardanelles andBosphorus to warships, which are more or less impervious to field  gun and  rifle fire,but they cannot  open  these channels  to merchant ships so long as the enemy is inpossession of the shores.    I do not think that these  arguments have  been presented in this form to  theFrench.  The French rely on General Joffre, and the strategical argument is the onlyone that will appeal to  him, and he is so close to the French military problem that thewider view may escape  him.    It is suggested that the Russians, who cannot fail to be  impressed  with thesearguments, should be asked  to put pressure both  on the French and on ourselves torelease the  comparatively moderate forces required for this operation, which should becloaked by apparent, but really sham, attacks  through Serbia  and at Alexandrettaor Haifa.
