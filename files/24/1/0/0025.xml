Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence. September 1915.SECRET.G-25.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Copy of a Letter from Mr, K. A. Murdoch to the Prime       Minister of the Australian Commonwealth.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,          September 28,1915,
OPT   OP  A  LETTER  EROM  MR.  K.  A.  MURDOCH  TO  THE  PRIME  MINISTER  OE  THE AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.               Arundel Hotel, Victoria Embankment,                      September 25, 1915.The Right Honourable    H. H. Asquith, P.C., M.P.,         Prime Minister.Dear Sir,   MR. LLOTD GEORGE has suggested to me thatI should place at your disposal whatever knowledge Igained of the Dardanelles operations while an Australiancivilian representative there.   I therefore  take the  liberty of sending to you acopy of a private letter I  have addressed to Mr. Eisher,in conformance with his request that I should writehim fully on the subject.   This  letter  was,  of  course,  intended  only  forCommonwealth  Ministers,  and  contains  referenceswhich will have no interest  to you.  But I feel justifiedin sending it to you, because if it adds one  iota to yourinformation, or presents the Australian point of view,it will be of service in this most critical moment.   I write with diffidence, and only at Mr.  LloydGeorge&apos;s  request.  In  any case, you  will know7  thatmy motive is one of affectionate regard for our soldiers&apos;interests.           I have the honour to be,                       Your obedient Servant,                                       K. A.  M.                High Commissioners Office, London,(Personal.)               September 23, 1915.Dear Mr. Eisher,   THE Cabinet will, ere this reaches you, have dealtwith my report on A.I.E. mails and wounded, so it is nogood my saying more on these subjects, other, that this:that if you allow the inert mass of congealed incompetencyin the Postal Department  to keep you from institutingalphabetical sorting by units, 75 per cent, of our unfor-tunate homesick ihen in hospitals  and at base dep6tswill continue to receive no home letters.   It is of bigger things I write you now.  I shall talk asif you were by my side, as in the good  days.  In mylast hurried note I  could deal only with a few urgentmatters affecting Australian administration,  especiallythose concerning appointments of  senior  officers andtreatment of wounded.   I now write of the unfortunate Dardanelles expedi-xion, in the light of what knowledge I could gain on thespot, on the lines of communication, and in Egypt.   It is undoubtedly one of  the  most terrible chaptersin our history.  Your fears have been justified.  I havenot military knowledge to be able  to say whether the    [1070]
enterprise ever had a chance  of succeeding.  Certainlythere has been a series  of disastrous  underestimations,and  I think our Australian generals are right  whenthey say that, had any one of these been luckily so un-English a thing  as an  overestimation, we  should havebeen through to  Constantinople at much less cost thanwe have paid for our slender perch on the cliffs of thePeninsula.   The first two  efforts, those of the fleet alone and ofthe  combined  forces in April-May, failed  miserablymainly because London expected  far too  much fromfloating artillery.  It is only  now being recognised thatthe naval guns, with their flat trajectory, are  of littleavail against the narrow Turkish trenches.  The lastgreat effort, that of the 6th to 12th August, was a costlyand  bloody fiasco, because, in addition to wretched staffwork,  the  troops sent  were inadequate and of mostuneven quality.   That failure  has created a situationwhich even  yet  has not been  seriously faced, i.e., achoice between withdrawal of our armies and hangingon for a fresh offensive after winter. -    Unfortunately, I was not in time for any of thosebig  operations, but I visited most parts of Anzac andSuvla Bay positions, walked many miles through thetrenches, conversed  with the leaders and  what seniorand junior officers I could reach, and was favoured inall parts with full and  frank confidence.  I could notvisit Helles, where we have about 25,000 men and manyanimals and cars  (armoured cars hidden  helpless  intrenches !).  We have abandoned our intentions of takingAchi Baba by frontal assault.  This was always a hope-less scheme after early May, and no one can understandwhy Hamilton  persisted with it. Achi Baba is a gradual,bare slope, a mass of trenches and gun emplacements,but so little did the General Staff know of its task thatit expected to storm it with ease.  Indeed, the GeneralStaff sent our artillery horses and ambulance transportwith our landing parties in April, as if the Australasianarmy  corps  could  get  astride  the peninsula in  a fewdays.   I assure you that if  our landing had  been  atGaba Tepe as proposed, only  a  few broken remnants ofour magnificent force  would  have  reached the vj firstdefensive line.  Having at last abandoned his expensivedesign to  storm Achi  Baba, Hamilton is keeping  hisdivisions at Helles merely  to hold a corresponding bodyof Turks.   Helles  is therefore the  most  quiet of thethree zones, though even there every yard of ground iscommanded by the enemy&apos;s guns, and even the beachesare frequently shelled.    A strong advance inland from Anzac has never beenattempted.   It is broken, rough, scrubby country, fullof gullies  and sharp ridges, and it is all within easyrange of the guns of the Turkish forts at the Narrowsand their artillery on Achi Baba and round about.  Noserious advance could  be made direct inland from thisquarter.  Our men were,  I found, immensely proud oftheir little progress on the plateau on our right Lone Pine Plateau.  Walker and  Whyte  thought it brilliant and wonderfully successful.  But I  found that we hadpaid 2,500 men for this advance on a short front of 300 yards!  That  is the only sort  of  advance we canmake from  Anzac proper.   The Lone Pine affair was partly in  the  nature  of  a holding movement, and  it certainly succeeded  in  holding a large body of Turks,
4iwho -maintained a series of fierce  counter-attacks  foreighty-two  hours, during which the Suvla  Bay opera-tions were in progress.    Suvla Bay is a  shallow, open  indentation in  thethickest part of the peninsula, about 2^ miles to  theleft of Anzac.   The flat country leading from the beachconsists mostly  of a marsh called Bitter Lake, which inwinter becomes a great morass.  After heavy rains  theflat is inundated.    On this flat in  August nearly  90,000  men werelanded.  They were New Army and Territorial divisions.They had spent a fortnight  on  the  water, in transportswhich  even the most  careful arrangements could  notmake wholesome.  I was on the lower deck on one ofthese and the place wras putrid.   The men could not beallowed on shore at ports of call.  One or  two regimentswere given route marches, but the long spell of ship  lifewas surely in every case weakening.   Those which wereto  land first were  given landing  practice  at  Mudros(advanced base) and Imbros (headquarters base),  butmany were set  ashore  direct from their ships at Suvla.In  addition to the ordinary weakening  effects of troop-ships was the nervous strain of expectation of submarines.Most  of the men  ignored  this,  but I was  on  the&quot; Beltana &quot; when a submarine was  sighted and fired at,and 1 know that this strain did  exist.    You can imagine, then,  that  these  fresh, raw,untried troops, under  amateur officers,  homesick  andapprehensive, were under normal in moral when  theday of  landing  approached.  They had  to  be packedlike sardines on the trawlers and small  destroyers  andvessels for  the  actual landing,  and were  kept like thisfor most of an  afternoon  and the  whole of  a night.Before this embarkation they  had each  received threedays&apos; supply of  iron rations biscuits and bully beef and had filled  their water-bottles one bottle  to eachman.    Then in the early hours came the landing, when  thelife of man is at its lowest.    I do not  sav that better arrangements  could havebeen made.  But I do say that in the first place to sendraw, young recruits  on this perilous enterprise was tocourt disaster;  and Hamilton wouldr have some reason-ableness behind his complaints that his men  let himdown, if he and his staff had not at the same time  letthe men down with grosser wrong-doings.    The landing was unopposed; the Turks were takencompletely by  surprise.  But with great celerity theygallopped their  artillery round, and opened fire also fromtheir  forts.   Before the  new troops had  advanced anydistance they were being racked with shell fire.    I  am informed by many officers that one divisionwent  ashore  without any orders whatsoever.  Anotherdivision, to which had  been  allotted the  essential workof  occupying the Anafarta  Hills, was  marched far tothe left before the  mistake in direction was noticed.  Itwas then recalled, and reformed, and  sent off towardsthe ridge.   As a practical man,  how much water do youthink  would be left  in  these thirsty English boys&apos;bottles  by this  time-after  the night on the seas, andthe hot march  out, march back,  and advance ?   Ofcourse, not a drop.   And yet the staff professes surprisethat before noon the men were weak for want of water.The whole  army suffered intensely  from thirst during
  the next  ^hree days.  There were  many deaths from.  thirst.  One general even assured me that the collapse  on Anafarta Hills was due to thirst.  Certainly these:  hot-blooded young men, scions of the thirstiest race  iu  the world, were sent out into tropical heat with food  calculated  to engender fierce thirst, and without water.  The divisional commanders have a just grievance against  the General Staff when they say that they were sent out  not only  with  indefinite orders and without a good  knowledge of the  country over which  they  were  to.  advance, but without water and with little or no know?  ledge of the few muddy wells existing in  those parts.      I  am, of course, only repeating what I  have been  told on all hands.   But you will trust me when I say-  that the work of the General Staff in Gallipoli  has been  deplorable. The general idea, that  of getting  astride  the peninsula and cutting the line  of communications  connecting the  southern Turkish army with its bases,  was  good.   1 understand  it was  Birdwood&apos;s  scheme.  The only criticism  I have heard against It is that the  great left flank movement  from Anzac, which was  (iirected against  Hill  971 and Ohunuk Bair, while the  Suvla Bay operations were in progress, was wasteful,  inasmuch as the splendid Australasian troops, Gurkhas,  and  Connaught  Rangers,  broken  to  pieces  in this  advance, could have been shipped  to Suvla, and there  used,  as the main wedge in the great effort to cross to* lyLaidos.  I discussed this criticism with our Australian  staff,  and found a decided opinion that the scheme as a  whole was sound.   The  left  flank  movement was  essential to the success of the Suyla advance,  owing  to the  dominating influence of Hill 971 and Chunuk  Bair.      The 9th Army Corps reached Anafarta Hills,  but  could not maintain their  position.   Of  the  terrible  manner of their retreat I need not tell you in this letter.  Qne of our generals, who had his men trying desperately  to.  hold on to the shoulders of 971 and Ohunuk Bair  (only a few Gurkhas really reached 971 and  a few  Australasians  Chunuk Bair), was staggered to  see the  9th and 10th Corps retreats, at the very time when their  firm  holding was essential.  He was  staggered by its  manner, and principally by the  obvious conflicts and  confusions between British generals,  due, I am told, to  the disinclination of two  of them to  accept orders from.  Pe Lisle,  who, though junior, had been placed in com-  mand after the  recall of General Stopford.   At least&apos;  two generals were recalled at once-Stopford,  who had  an army corps, and Hammersley, who for two years was  under lopk ancl key through lapse of memory, but who  Was thought good enough by London for this work of  supreme importance to the Empire.   I am told  that  a  Second  divisional  commander was  recalled.    Diverse  fates  were in store for brigade commanders-at least one,  Kenna, V.C., was killed in action.     The .6th to 10th August operations at  Suyla left  us  holding  a position which  is  nothing more  than an.  embarrassment.   We are about 1 j miles inland;  but we  do, not hold a single cpmmanding point nor one  of real  strategic value, and our one little eminence. Chocolate  Hill,  is, I am  assured by artillery  officers, perilously  unsafe.  It is commanded by ttiose  crests  on which  masses  of  Turks are perched, and bg screened artillery  at which we cannot possibly get.      [1070]  &quot;                                o
    Perhaps this awful defeat of the 6th to 10th August,in which our Imperial armies lost 35  per  cent, of theirstrength fully  33,000  men was  due as  much toinferior troops as to any  other  cause.  But that cannotbe said of the desperate effort made on the 21st August,after  the Turks had had plenty of  time in  which tobring up strong reinforcements  and to increase thenatural  strength of their positions, to take their positionsby  frontal assault.   Some of  the finest  forces on thepeninsula were used in this bloody battle.   The glorious29th Division, through which  40,000 men have passed,and which is now reduced to less than 5,000 men, werespecially brought up from  Helles, and  the  mounteddivision of Territorial Yeomanry were  brought  over fromEgypt.   They and other troops were dashed against theTurkish lines, and broken.  They never  had a chanceof holding their positions when for one brief hour theypierced the Turks&apos; first line; and  the slaughter of fineyouth was appalling.  My criticism is  that, as thesetroops were  available, they should, undoubtedly, havebeen used in  early August; and to fling  them, withouteven the element of  surprise, against such  trenches asthe Turks made, was murder.    One word more in this very sketchy and incompletestory of the August operations.  It concerns the heroicadvance  of  Australasian,  Gurkha,   and  ConnaughtRangers troops from our left  flank at Anzac.  It wasmade from  a New  Zealand  outpost,  heroically  heldduring the long summer  months  away to our left, andconnected with our main position by a long sap.   TheNew Zealand Rifles swept the hills of snipers, and werepractically wiped out  in  doing  so.  Through themadvanced the Wellington Brigade, other New Zealandforces, the Gurkhas and Irishmen, and our magnificent4th Brigade, brought up to a strength of far over 4,000for the event.  The advance through broken, scrubby,impossible country  in  the night,  despite mistakes byguides and  constant bayonet  fighting, was one of themost  glorious efforts of  the Dardanelles.  There is  adisposition to blame Monash for not pushing further in,but I have been over the country, through the gulliesand over the hills, and I cannot see how  even as muchas he did could have  been expected.  Of  course, ourmen did not  hold even the shoulder of Chunuk Bair;but only a few hundreds reached it, after most desperatehand-to-hand fighting, and they were swept off by anadvance of more than  5,000 Turks.  We did not haveenough men  for the operation.  It was  a  question ofdepth and weight: and it is sad to think that we gainedour objective, all but the highest slopes; and that wehad not sufficient  reserves to  stay there.   Even ifAnafarta Hills had been held in support of us, we couldnot have stayed on this vital  Ohunuk Bair with theforce at our disposal.    The  heroic 4th Brigade was  reduced  in three days&apos;fighting to little more than 1,000  strong.  You will beglad to know that the men died well.    I  must  leave this  story, scrappy as it  is, of theoperations, to tell you of the situation and the problemsthat face us.  I will do so with the frankness  you haveahvays encouraged.    Winter is on us, and it brings grave dangers.  Wehave  about 105,000 men and some  25,000 animals-SO per cent, mules on the peninsula.  About 25,000 of
 these are at Helles, 35,000 at Anzac, and the rest at Suvla.   Suvla and Anzac are now joined, thanks to the brilliant Australasian work on the left flank; and it is important to remember that there are two retreats frpm Suvla: one to Anzac, the other by sea.   These are all that  remain of fully 260,000 men.   Nowhere are we protected from Turkish shell.   Our  holdings  are  so small and narrow that we cannot  hide from  the  Turks the positions of our guns, and repeatedly damage is done to  them.  On the other hand, the Turks have a vast country in  which  to select gun  positions.  They can change them with ease, and we cannot place them. You would marvel at the impossibility even of getting at the guns enfilading Anzac from the right.  These are hidden in  an olive grove under Killid Bair plateau, and con- tinuous efforts on the part of warships and our own finely operated  artillery have  been resultless.   These guns have direct fire  on our beaches,  and frequenly cause serious damage.  All three positions are so exposed that one wonders  why the Turks do  not drive us out with artillery  fire.  Helles is  the most  secure of all, but Anzac, and especially Suvla,  are very much exposed. Had  the Turks sufficient  modern artillery and shells, they  could make Suvla unbearable and  Anzac an even worse hell than it is.  Our staff  has  various opinions about the Turkish supply of shells, but it seems certain that  there  is an  even  greater  shortage amongst  the Turks than amongst us; otherwise the Turks are saving their shell  for serious  winter  offensives.  I  must  say that the theory that the Turks are really short of shells did not impress me.  I  frequently watched them waste three shrapnel shells on the mere sport of making a trawder  up-anchor and move out to sea.   Of course, trawlers are occasionally hit, but the Turks cannot take such  shell-fire seriously.  I have seen as many as eight shells fired  at two trawlers.  One day  recently sixty shells were placed by the right-flank-enfilading guns on the New Zealand  beach.   They  caused  damage and cbst us, sixty-five  men,  but they showed also that the Turks are not very short.    At the same time, one wonders whether the Turks are not merely playing with us, holding  us there until they are helped by nature to drive us out.   But that idea is discounted by the fact that the Turks have made many serious and costly efforts to get rid of us.    At Helles, the narrow cape  gives some sort of pro- tection from the waves, but it would be absurd to  think that even this will permit  of the landing of supplies in rough weather.   Two steamships have been sunk to provide a breakwater, with the careless  disregard of expense which has marked the whole of this unfortunate enterprise.  These ships are even now, in the early days of autumn, rolling from side to side with the slight sea swell.   At Anzac,  there is  only open anchorage.  We have  made  three  small wooden  piers, each  of  them banked on one side with sand-bags as a protection for the men  against  shells.  But against  these  the water barges are beginning to sway dangerously.  At Suvla more  ships are to be sunk.  There can  be no sort of safe landing-place there either.    Can we keep the armies supplied with  food, muni-tions,  and drafts ?  Many mariners  and some naval men say no,   I discussed  this question with naval transport officers  on the staff ship in  Mudros, including a high
 and responsible official, and I am assured that the work can be clone.   It will mean great cost.  The Navy says, in effect, that great reserves must be stored up in spells of calm weather, and that at times it may be necessary to get stuff ashore by running a supply ship on to  the beach, from which the goods will have to be taken by the beach parties under the concentrated and accurate fire of the enernv&apos;s artillery.    I do not think, therefore, that the question of rough seas  is vital.   But  certainly, should,  as I  hope,  the Cabinet  decide  to hang on  through the  winter  for another offensive, or for peace, we are faced with serious dangers from cold, rain,  and  snow on land.  All  our engineering work has been done  with the idea that  our positions would be evacuated by  winter; and the roads are made in winter water-courses,  the trenches  are summer trenches,  and  the  dug-outs mere protection against shrapnel, not against weather.  All this  means tremendous structural changes, and the immediate con- struction of good  roads.   And  I  fear that the decision has been left too  late for such work to be thoroughly undertaken before the winter is upon us.   No structural material had reached Anzac when I left-, nor had  the food  reserves amounted   to  more than fourteen davs&apos; supplies.    Perhaps the most vital danger from weather is that, before the rains come to end all our water troubles, there will be a spell of  bad weather at sea that will prevent us from getting water shore, and our troops will have a grave water shortage added to their other trials. No water supply for a month would  raise questions of the utmost gravity. .    But we can overcome weather  troubles  at Helles and Anzac, and even at Suvla  also, though General Byng asserts that he cannot keep his forces there when the lake  cuts  his  positions in  twain, unless he  can bridge the  immense width of  this strange seasonal stretch of water.   What  is more serious is the ques- tion of Turkish attacks  during  the  cold, wet  winter months.    They cannot drive us  from  Anzac.  Of  that  I  am sure.   Australasian ingenuity and endurance have made the place a fortress,  and it is inhabited and guardedby determined and dauntless men.  But Suvla is more precarious.  I am  not prepared  to say that Suvla cantje held during winter.  There  is  a grave possibility of a German army appearing on the scene.   In any case,the arrival of a number  of heavy German guns might be  quite  sufficient, to finish our expedition off.  Big German1 howitzers could  batter our trenches to  pieces,and we  could  have  no  reply.  And remember that several of our vital positions, such as Quinn&apos;s Post, are only a few small yards of land on the top of a cliff merefootholds  on the  cliffs.  Whether  the Germans  gettheir guns through or not, we must make up our mindsthat the Turkish activity will be much greater in winterthan  ever before.  The  enemy  will be  able to  con-centrate  his artillery, when he knows that  we are  nolonger threatening any of his positions.  He will  beable to drag across great guns from his forts, and give any position of  ours a terrible mauling.  He will have great reinforcements within reach, unless the published stories,  and the  tales of travellers,  of his large newlevies, are quite untrue.
    We have to face not only this  menace,  hut the; frightful weakening effect Of sickness.   Already the ties are spreading- dysentery to an alarming extent, and the sick-rate would  astonish you.   It cannot he less than 600 a day..  We, must. be. evacuating, fully  1,000 sick and wounded men every day.  When the autumn rains come and unbury  our dead, now lying under a light soil in our trenches, sickness must increase.  Even now the stench in many  of our trenches  is sickening. Alas, the good human stuff that there lies buried,. the; brave hearts still, the sorrow in our hard-hit Australian households!    Supposing we lose only 30,000. during winter from sickness.   That means that when spring comes we shall have about 60,000 men left.  But  they  will not be an army.  They will, be a. broken  force, spent.  A winter in Gallipoli will be a winter under severe  strain, under, shell-fire, under the  expectation of attack, and in the; anguish which is inescapable on  this  shell-torn  spot., The troops will in reality  be on guard throughout.the: winter;  They will stand, to arms throughout long and bitter nights.   Nothing  can be expected from:  them, when  at last  the normal  fighting days  come again. The new offensive must  then be,  made  with a  huge army of new troops.  Can we: get them?   Already the complaint in Eranee is. that, we cannot, fill the gaps.;. that  after  an advance our  thinned  ranks cannot  be- replenished.    But  I am not a pessimist, aud  if there  is really military necessity for this awful ordeal,, then I  am. sure the Australian troops will face it.   Indeed, anxious though they are to leave  the  dreary and  sombre  sceno of their  wreckage,  the  Australian  divisions would; strongly resent the  confession of failure that a with- drawal  would  entail.  They are dispirited, they  have been through warfare as no army has seen in any part of the world, but they are game to the end.    On the high political  question of whether good is to, be served by.keeping the armies in Gallipoli,. I can say little, for I am  uninformed..  Cabinet  Ministers  hero. impress  me with the fact  that a  failure  in the  Dar- danelles would have most serious  results in India. Persia is  giving endless trouble, and there seems to be; little doubt that India, is. ripe for  trouble.  Nor  do I, know whether the appalling outlay in money on the Dardanelles expedition, with its huge and costly line of communications, can be  allowed to  continue  without; endangering those financial resources  on which we rely to: so great an extent in. the wearing down of Germany&apos;s strength.  Nor  do I  know whether any offensive  next year against Constantinople can succeed.  On that point I  can only say that the best military advice is  that wo can get through, that we would be through now if we had thrown in sufficient forces.  Whyte^ whom  we both admire  as an able soldier and an inspiring Australian leader, assures: me that another 15.0,000 men would do the job.  I. presume that would mean a landing  on- a, lasrge scale  somewhere; in Thrace^  or north of Bulair.; Certainly, any advance against, the; extraordinarily strong trenches narrow and: deep, like allthe: Turks&apos; wonderful. trench work, and: covered with heavy? timber overhead protection  against shellrfire  and  bombs, from  our:present, positions seems impracticable,, You, would havewept with Hughes and myself if you had gone- with u&amp;    [1070]                                    D
over the ground where two of our finest Light Horse regi-ments were wiped out in ten minutes in a brave effortto advance a few yards to Dead Men&apos;s Ridge.  We lost500  men, squatters&apos; sons and farmers&apos;  sons, on thatterrible spot.  Such is the cost of so much as lookingout over the top of our trenches.   And now one word about the troops.   No  one whosees  them at work  in  trenches and on beaches and insaps  can doubt that  their  moral  is  very severelyshaken indeed.  It is far worse  at  Suvla, although themen there are only two months from home, than any-where else.  The  spirit at Suvla  is simply deplorable.The  men have no confidence in the staff, and to tell thetruth they have little  confidence  in London.   I shallalways remember the stricken face of a  young Englishlieutenant when I told him he  must make up his mindfor a winter campaign.  He had had a month of physicaland mental torture,  and the prospect of a winter seemedmore than he could bear.  But his greatest dread wasthat the London authorities  would not begin  until toolate  to send winter provisions.  All the new army  isstill  clothed  in  tropical uniforms,  and  when  I left,London was still  sending out  drafts in thin &quot;shorts.&quot;Everywhere one  encountered the same fear  that thearmies would be  left to  their fate, and that the manyshipments of materials, food, and  clothing required forwinter would not  be despatched until the weather madetheir landing impossible.  This lack of confidence in theauthorities arises  principally from  the fact that  everyman knows that the last operations were grossly bungledby the General Staff, and that Hamilton has led a seriesof armies into a series of culs-de-sac.  You would hardlybelieve the evidence of your own  eyes at Suvla.  Youwould refuse  to  believe that  these men were reallyBritish soldiers.   So badly  shaken are they  by theirmiserable defeats  and  by   their  surroundings;  sophysically affected  are they by the  lack  of water andthe monotony of a salt beef and  rice diet, that theyshow an atrophy of mind and body that is appalling.I must confess that in  our  own  trenches, where ourmen have been kept on  guard  for  abnormally longperiods,  I  saw  the same  terrible atrophy.   You canunderstand how  it  arises.  It  is   like the look of  atortured dumb animal.   Men living in trenches with nomovement  except when they  are digging,  and withnothing to look at except a narrow strip of sky and theblank walls of their prisons, cannot remain cheerful oreven thoughtful.  Perhaps some efforts could have beenmade by  the War Office to  provide them with cinemasor entertainment, but, of course, Gallipoli is at the endof a long and costly, not to  say dangerous, line of com-munication.   This  fact is   the only excuse  for theexcess of bully-beef feeding.   The physique  of those at Suvla is not to be corn-pared  with  that of  the  Australians.   Nor is theirintelligence.  I fear also that the British  physique isvery much below that of the Turks.  Indeed, it is quiteobviously so.   Our  men have found it  impossible  toform a high opinion of the  British K. men and terri-torials.   They are merely a lot  of childlike youths,without strength to endure or brains to  improve their-conditions.  I do not like to dictate this sentence, evenfor your eyes, but the fact is that after the first  day  atSuvla  an order had to be issued to officers  to  shoot
without  mercy any soldiers  who  lagged  behind orloitered in  an &quot;advance.   The  Kitchener  army  showedperfection in  manoeuvre training they kept a good lineon the Suvla  plain but that is not the kind of trainingrequired  at the Dardanelles, and  it a question reallywhether the training has been of the right kind.   Allthis  is very  dismal, and  they are, of course, only  myimpressions.  But every Australian officer and managrees with what  I say.   At Anzac  the moral is good.  The men are thoroughlydispirited, except  the new arrivals.   They are weakenedsadly by  dysentery  and illness.  They have been over-worked,  through  lack of reinforcements.  And as anarmy of  offence they are done. - Not one  step can bemade with the first Australian division until it has beencompletely rested and refitted.  But it is having onlyone  month&apos;s  rest at Mudros.  The New  Zealand andAustralian Division (Godley&apos;s) also is reduced to only afew thousand men and has  shot its bolt.   But the menof Anzac would  never  retreat.  And  the  one way tocheer them up is  to pass  the word that the Turks  aregoing to  attack, or that an assault by our forces is beingplanned.   The great fighting spirit.of  the  race is stillburning in these  men; but  it does not burn  amongstthe toy soldiers of Suvla.  You could imagine nothingfiner than the spirit of some Australian  boys all ofgood parentage who were  stowed away on a troopshipI was on in  the iEgean, having deserted their posts inAlexandria out of mere shame of the thought of return-ing  to Australia without  having taken  part  in  thefighting  on Anzac&apos;s sacred  soil.   These fine countrylads, magnificent  men, knew that their  desertion wouldcost them their stripes, but that and the loss of  pay didnot  worry them.   How  wbnderfuliy generous  is  theAustralian soldier&apos;s  view of life!  These lads discussedquite fearlessly the  prospects of their deaths, and theirview was:  &quot;  It is no disgrace for  an Australian to diebesicle good pals in Anzac, where his best pals are underthe dust.&quot;    But I could pour into your ears so much truth aboutthe grandeur of our Australian army, and the wonderfulaffection of these fine young soldiers for e^ch other &quot;andtheir homeland, that your Australianism would  becomea more powerful  sentiment than before.  It is  stirringto see them, magnificent manhood, swinging their finelimbs as  they walk  about Anzac.   They have the noblefaces of  men  who have endured.   Oh,  if you  couldpicture Anzac as  I have seen it, you would find that tobe an Australian  is  the greatest privilege the world  hasto offer.    It is only these fighting qualities, and the specialcapacity of the Australian physique to endure hardship,that keep  the moral at Anzac good.  The men havegreat faith in Birdwood, Walker, and Legge-not muchin Godley.   Birdwood struck me as a good army corpscommander, but nothing more.   He has not the fightingquality nor the big  brain of a  great general.   Walkeris a plain hard-hitting soldier.  We are lucky in thesemen.  But  for  the  General  Staff,  and,  I fear,  forHamilton, officers and men have nothing but contempt.They  express  it fearlessly.  That,  however,  is&quot;  notpeculiar  to Anzac.   Sedition is  talked round every tinof bully beef on the peninsula, and it is only loyaltythat holds the forces together.  Every  returning troop-
ship, every section of  the  lines of communications, is?full, of the same talk.. I  like General Hamilton, andfound him  exceedingly kindly;  I  admire him as a.journalist; hut as a strategist he has completely failed.Undoubtedly the essential and first step  to restore  themoral of  the shaken forces  is to recall him and  hisChief of Staff, a man more cordially detested  in ourforces than Enver Pasha.   What the army there wantsis a young  leader, a man who has had  no  past, andaround  whom  the officers can  rally.   I am hopingstrongly  that Smith-Dorrien will not  be sent  out,because whether  he failed or not in Erance, he will bosaid to have failed, and the troops on  the  peninsulamust not be allowed  to harbour the suspicion thatsecond-rate  goods  are  any  longer considered goodenough for them.    I cannot  see  any solution which  does  not beginwith the  recall  of Hamilton.    Perhaps  before  thisreaches you  this recall  will have occurred.  Do notbelieve anything  yon may  see about a large reinforce-ment and a new offensive  before the winter.   That Ifear is impossible.  If, after the  Suvla  Bay  disaster,.we had had  another hundred thousand men to pourinto, the  peninsula, we might well have got  through ;hut  as it is  we hold positions that are  nothing morethan costly embarrassments.  It is not for me to judgeHamilton, but it  is  plain that  when  an army hascompletely lost  faith in its  general,  and he  has  on.numerous occasions proved his  weaknesses,  only onething can be done.  He has very seldom been at Anzac.He lives  at Imbros. The French call him the generalwho. lives on an island.  The story may not  be true,but. the army believes that  Hamilton left Suvla on the21st  August remarking,  &quot; Everything hangs  in thebalance;  the Yeomanry are  about to  charge.&quot;  Ofcourse, the army laughs at  a general who leaves thebattlefield when everything hangs in the balance.   I could make this letter interminable, and  I fearthat I have only touched very incompletely  on. a fewphases.   What I want to say to you now very seriouslyis that the  continuous  and ghastly bungling over theDardanelles enterprise was  to be expected from such aGeneral Staff as the British  Army possesses, so  far asI have seen it.  The conceit  and self-complacency ofthe  red feather men are equalled only  by  their  in-capacity.   Along,  the  line  of   communications,  andespecially at  Mudros,  are  countless, high officers  andconceited young  cubs. who. are  plainly only playing atwar.  What  can you expect of men who have neverworked seriously,  who have lived for their appearance.and for social distinction  and self-satisfaction,, and whoare: now called on to conduct a gigantic war ? Kitchenerhas  a terrible task in getting pure work out  of. thesemen,, whose motives can never be pure,  for they  areunchangeably selfish.   I want to say frankly  that, it is.my opinion, and  that without exception of Australianofficers, that  appointments to  the  General  Staff  aremade from motives of friendship and  social influence.Australians, now  loathe  and  detest  any Englishmanwearing red.   Without  such a  purification of motiveas will bring youth and ability to the top, we cannot win.   I could tell you of many scandals,, but the instance:that will best appeal to you  is that of the  staff ship&quot; Aragon.&quot;  She  is a magnificent and, luxurious South-
 American liner, anchored in Mudros harbour as a base- - for the staff of the Inspector-General of Communica- . tions.   I can give you no idea of how the Australians- and the new British officers too-loathe the   Aragon.&quot; Heaven knows  what  she is  costing,  but  certainly the staff lives in luxury.  And nothing  can  exceed the rudeness of these chocolate General Staff soldiers to   those   returning. from  the  front.   The  ship&apos;s adjutant is the worst instance of rude and  disgusting snobbishness  and  incapacity  I  have come  across. With  others,  plain  downright  incapacity is the main- characteristic.  I  must say this  of  them  also,  that whereas of  our  3rd   Australian.  General Hospital on shore  we had 134  fever  cases,  including typhus, with  only a few mosquito  nets, and  no^ ice, and  few medical comforts, the &quot; Aragon &quot; staff  was wallowing in ice.  Colonel Stawell you know him as Melbourne&apos;s leading consultant- and Sir Alex. M&apos;Cormick are not sentimentalists.   But they really wept over  the terrible hardships of the wounded, due to the incapacity of the &quot;Aragon.&quot;  One concrete case  is that of 150 wounded men landed in dead of  night, with no  provision and no instructions, at the hospital beach  to make their way as best they could to the hospital, which had no notice- of  their arrival.   Eiaschi, de  Crespigny, Stawell, and. Kent Hughes will be able to tell you of the absolutely. shocking difficulties of this hospital in face of perpetual snubbing and bungling of the  &quot; Aragon &quot; staff.  While I was  at the hospital, a beautiful general and his staff rode in to make an inspection.  Despite their appear- ance as perfect specimens of the General Staff, I thought: &quot; We  shall now get the ice from the &quot; Aragon &quot;  on to the brows  of  our  unfortunate  men.&quot;  But no ice appeared  next day.  The navy is very good, and sent some comforts and  ice across, but  for the  three  days before my visit   this  ice had gone  astray  before it reached the hospital.    I  told you in my last  letter of the necessity for canteen ships, and need not go  into that now,  but on the point of the General Staff I must say  that the work at bases in Egypt struck me as on a par with that of the &quot;Aragon.&quot; Some day you will have to take up the case of : Sir John  Maxwell.  He has a  poor brain for his big position, and I assure  you  that our officers at Anzac have  a poor opinion of  the  work  of his  lieutenant, General  Spens-a  man broken on the Continent, and therefore thought good enough  to supervise the training of  Australians who  is  controlling  our bases.   The question you will have to fight out about  Maxwell is this :  After the last  disturbance in the Whasa, when a very few of  our men burnt some houses in which  they had been drugged and diseased, he issued one of his famous lecturing orders, in which he referred to his  regret that &quot;even wilful murder&quot; had  been mentioned as one of the Australian crimes in Cairo.  In this casual way ,di,d he blast the good name of our  clean and vigorous army. I enquired as far as was possible, and could hear nothing of even a charge  of wilful murder  mentioned against any Australian. This order roused intense anger amongst our men.  Perhaps we are too sensitive our men  were certainly too sensitive in their anger in the trenches whena notice was posted, I think in  orders, describing how anunfortunate British Tommy had been  shot at Helles atdawn for cowardice,  It was  almost amusing to  hear    [1070]                             &apos;      E
our men  resent this even remote connection with theAustralian forces and a veiled threat of such  shooting.&quot; Such things have nothing to do with us,&quot; they said.    Our men feel that their reputation  is too sacred toleave in the hands of Maxwell, and  they much resentthe sudden change in the attitude of the General Staff,which legarded them as criminals in Cairo,  and nowlavishly calls them heroes in Gallipoli.    You will think that  all this is a sorry picture, hut donot forget that the enemy has his troubles, and that wehave certain signs  that his  moral is deteriorating.From what I saw of the Turk I am convinced that he isa brave and generous foe, and he is fighting now fordear home, with a feeling that  he is  winning, and thathe  is a better man  than those opposed to him.  TheTurks, by the way, are  as generous  in their  -praise ofour men as the British  and French are.  Certainly theTurks are positively afraid of our men,  and one of theirtrenches that opposite Quinn&apos;s  Post-is such a placeof  fear, owing to the indomitable  way in  which  oursniper&apos;s and bomb-throwers have got their  men down,that Turks  will not go into  it unless  they are madecorporals.  So  say our  Intelligence  Officers.   I  sawmany strange and remarkable instances of the humanityand courage of the Turks.  Certainly his trenches arebetter than anything we can  do, and he makes themremarkably quickly.    One  word more  to-day.   Do, for Heaven&apos;s sake,make every effort to secure  the recall of Sir  JamesPorter,  the  Englishman in  charge  of  the  medicalservices.  Our  doctors  are,  without  exception,  furiouswith  him.  He  made a shocking muddle  of the firstarrangements for transport of wounded, as I wrote  you.The case against him there was unanswerable.  But  hehas been  left in charge,  and his muddling continues.He lives  on a  luxurious yacht in  Mudros.   Oh!  noAustralian has the heart to tell of the fearful wreckageof lives due to this man&apos;s incompetency.  That is not awild statement.  It is truth.  Even now, the great bulkof the wounded are sent to Imbros before being passedon  to  hospitals  elsewhere.   This handling aggravatessickness and wounds, yet the  generals wonder why mensent  away  from the  peninsula  with  slight sicknessbecome wrorse and do not, as expected, return in a fewweeks do not return at all.  Our Australian doctorshave bearded Porter in his den, and talked open defianceto him, in the vain  hope that he would insist  on anenquiry, or lay a charge against them.  &quot;We  must makethe best of  the  R.A.M.C., but we surely need not  beburdened  longer with Porter5s sins. After having heardand seen  something of  the awful bungling of thewounded transport arrangements, one wonders how it ispossible that the War Office should  regard with coni-placency  the prospect  of leaving this  man the verydifficult work of getting  sick and wounded from thepeninsula during the winter.   The only reason I canthink of is that professional soldiers stick to each otherthrough thick and thin.    I hope I have not  made the picture too gloomy.I have great faith still  in the Englishman;  and, as Isaid, the enemy is  having his own troubles  too.   Butthis unfortunate  expedition  has  never been  given  a-chance.   It required large bodies of seasoned troops.It required a great leader.  It required self-sacrifice on ,
the part of the staff, as well as that sacrifice so wonder-fully and liberally made on the part of the soldiers.  Ithas  had none of these things.  Its troops have beensecond class, because untried  before their awful battlesand  privations of the peninsula.    And behind it all isa gross selfishness and complacency on the part of thestaff.   Much more I could tell you, but my task is done,though  I shall write again  next  mail I hope withbetter news.   This, of course, is a private letter, butyou  will  show it to George Pearce and Hughes, so Ishall say nothing more  than the  plain  good-bye of afriend.                         Sincerely yours,psnrtBS AT ess zaaaiair OFFICE BY C. B. HAEBKOW.-30/9/1915.
