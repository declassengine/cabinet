REMARKS   BY   THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE    FOR  WAR   ON   THE   CHANCELLOR   OF    THE  EXCHEQUERS  MEMORANDUM (G-7)    ON THE  CONDUCT OF  THE WAR.   I WOULD like to make the following observationson the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ very interestingpaper on the state of the war.   I will not now  refer to the figures quoted by theChancellor, as  the  seriousness  of our position can berealised and considered quite apart from the question ofthe numbers of  the combatants on  either  side.  TheChancellor rightly points out that the Russian  Colossus,as some people described  our  Russian  Ally, has  notproduced  that effect on the progres i of the war whichthose who took  an optimistic view anticipated.  Never-theless, in my  opinion, Russia has done  remarkablywell,  and, according to my view  of  the situation,  shewill be  found to have  saved us six  months out of thethree years which,  as my colleagues will remember,  Iestimated, in  the House of  Lords, might be the durationof the war.   We must  remember that at the outset ourchief requirement was  time, and  though the  Germanshave  strained every effort they have not succeeded ingiving a knock-out  blow at any time during the sevenmonths of hostilities. It is true that  they occupy a largeexpanse of territory  outside their country, but the war isnot on that account  more likely to end in their favour.   If we are  victorious, the end of the war  must comethrough one  of the two following  causes : (1) By  adecisive victory, or  a succession of decisive victories, ofthe Allies, which may  take place just as well outsideGerman territory as within it; or (2) hj attrition, forwhen Germany  is no longer able to support  her armiesin sufficient strength in the field she must sue for peace.I think it would be interesting to  obtain, and I amarranging with  Lord Moulton to furnish, a mathematicalcalculation of approximate dates when attrition mightforce our enemies to sue  for peace.  As far  as  I  canjudge now, 1  think that about the beginning of 1917 thisstate of affairs may be reached.   I  leave out  of  calculation  the  possibility  of  thestarvation of  Germany  and Austria, where 105 millionsof civil population have to be fed.   With regard to  the Chancellor of the Exchequerspractical suggestions, I  am  glad to think that there  iremore factories available for the output of war materialin this country, but the real crux of the situation is,in my opinion,  the  organization of the skilled labourrequired to wrork the machinery, and, if the Chancellorof the Exchequer could help us in this and in the manylabour difficulties with which we are confronted, I havelittle  doubt that in  time an increased number of men,up to a total of  3,000.000, may be recruited and trainedfit to take the field.[320-1]
    In the efforts we are now making  to  raise, arm,  andequip 2,000,000 men we are faced with grave difficulties,not the least  of which is that,  constantly,  our rnanu-facturers  find themselves  unable, owing to shortage ofskilled labour, to keep their promises of delivery of arms,ammunition, &amp;c.  This shortage could be  very muchlessened by the employment of unskilled together withskilled labour on  the  same machines, but trade unionrules do not admit  of this.   One of the first essentials,therefore,  is  to  secure the  requisite modifications ofthose rules.    A committee is sitting, on  which  Sir George Gibbrepresents the War Office, for the purpose of organizinglabour.   I  understand   that  they  have  been moreor  less   successful  in   some  of  their   efforts  toinduce trades unions to  agree  to modify  the  restric-tive regulations which they now  impose  on labour ;  butif  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  could  use  hisgreat powers  to persuade the  trades unions  to  dealwith  this matter at once, he  would be doing  a great-deal to help us in preparing an army of  the dimensionshe regards as necessary.   I  quite agree with him thatthe closing of public-houses in  areas occupied  by ourlabouring classes  would  have  a very good  effect,  butsuch a measure would  no  doubt  have  to be carried outwith  care, as the men might  resent any interferencewith their present habits.   I would suggest, in this con-nection, that by keeping the  public-houses closed up to11  A.M. it would  be possible to get  the men  into theworks before they had had an opportunity of obtainingintoxicants.    We are making a great effort  to increase our  armiesin  the theatre of the war up to 2,000,000  men, includingthose required to maintain the  force  in  the field.   Weare just beginning to see the results that have beenachieved, and the difficulties that we have to face in thecreation of these new armies.  Until we can actually putinto the field a considerable number of our new forces,I doubt  whether it would be advisable to attempt furtherincreases, except as regards the placing of orders for thenecessary armament. Our present output will, of course,be continuous, and will not cease when any specific quan-tities of articles are delivered ;  every effort is continuallybeing made  to  increase production, but  the  greatdifficulty I foresee is that  to which 1 have referred, viz.,the labour question.    When our new armies  are prepared to take the field,it will be undoubtedly  a matter of vital importance thatthey should be employed  in the  most  effective manner,so as to secure decisive results,  and that they should notbe scattered on subsidiary enterprises.    Much  depends  upon  the success of  the Navy inforcing the Dardanelles, but we have not sufficient menavailable at present to  attack the Turkish troops on theGallipoli Peninsula.  As  the situation develops  in theNear East, we shall be better able to judge how  ourtroops could be best employed when ready.                                                Iv.    February 25, 1915.IUUNTJSD AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. It. HAURISON. 1/3/1915.
