ALEXANDRETTA AND MESOPOTAMIA.[The Admiralty wish to acknowledge  the  assistance  of   Mr. Julian Corbett  of  the  Historical Section of the   Committee of Imperial Defence in the preparation   of this Memorandum.]   1. IN considering the old question of a connectinglink  between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates underBritish  control, it has to be recognised that the  con-siderations on which decisions have been made or shelvedin the past are now fundamentally changed.   The new factors are two      (1.) The impending break-up of the Turkish Empire,          and particularly the probable fate of Con-          stantinople.     (2.) The British occupation of Lower Mesopotamia.   Formerly the question, which has been chronic sinceabout 1830,  was always decided by balancing the risk orresponsibility which  the enterprise would entail againstthe advantages of a quicker  road  to India, and  inci-dentally of a more convenient emporium  for the trade ofthe Mesopotamian area, such as the trade then was.   2. Now,  on  the assumption that  in  the  event  of  asuccessful issue of the present war we intend to retainpossession of at least Lower Mesopotamia, the questionis on a different plane. It is a question of a direct  com-munication not with  India, but with our new possessionand  of an  outlet not  for the   trade  in  its  formerdimensions,  but as it will  be when a delta, six times  aslarge as that  of  the Nile,  is invigorated  by  a greatsystem  of irrigation, by Indian immigration, and by thedevelopment of the rich adjacent oilfields.   3.  The   idea   dates  from  the  suggestions  ofGeneral Chesney  as  early as 1829.   In its original  formthe proposal was  for a canal from the Bay of Antioch  tothe  river, but as railways began  about  this time  tosupplant  canals  as  the   chief  preoccupation  of thefinancial world, this idea disappeared, and that  of  arailway took its place.  In  1836  Chesney&apos;s studies andexploration had so much impressed opinion that a SelectCommittee  was  appointed, which  resulted in a largeexpedition being sent out to make the necessary surveysand  to ascertain if the river was navigable for steamers.Chesney proved his  case and a concession was obtainedfrom the Porte for a railway from Seleucia to the riverby way of Aleppo.   4. Though a  company  was formed  to work it, theenterprise never ripened.  It had to meet the rivalry of     [420]                                   B 2
Waghorns  overland route, the  interruption  of  theCrimean War, and finally the opposition of Napoleon III,to which Lord Palmerston felt bound to give way.    5. For  some years the  success of the Suez Canalstood in the way of any revival of the project, but onthe fall of  the  Second Empire the whole question wasagain investigated  by two Select Committees under thepresidency of Sir Stafford  Northcote.  The scheme hadby this time developed into a project for a railway fromAlexandretta or  Seleucia  to  the  Persian  Gulf.  Forsome years  a   controversy  had  raged  betweeu  theadvocates  of  the  two  starting-points,  Alexandrettabeing condemned  as  fever-stricken and   Seleucia ashaving long since ceased to exist as a port.  There wasan equally strong difference of opinion as  to the  bestroute to take, and as to  whether the railway could everrepay its cost.   On all  these points  a vast amount ofevidence was taken, but the Committees were unable todecide any one  of them.   They confined themselves to anon-committal report which recommended a new survey.   6. The  question thus lay dormant until the time ofthe Berlin  Treaty, when Lord  Beaconsfield is  said tohave turned his attention to it seriously in connectionwith the occupation of Cyprus under the Turkish Con-vention  of  1878.  The  declared object of  this  occupa-tion  (over  and above its  intention as a guarantee forreforms in Asia Minor) was as  a security against thepossible consequences of  a permanent advance of: theRussian Asiatic frontier  to beyond  Ears.   If Russiaevacuated  that  region  we  were  to  evacuate Cyprus.There is reason to believe that  Lord  Beaconsfieldregarded a Euphrates railway as  the best means ofchecking  a  further movement  of Russia  southward.Cyprus, it is said, was valued by him chiefly as  a placed&apos;armes and naval station to cover the rail-head,  and SirJohn Ardagh, his military attache at the Berlin Congress,was instructed to work out the whole project. -   7. This view of the possibilities of our conventionwith Turkey appears to have been not unrecognised onthe Continent.  It is dealt with in a pamphlet written inFrench  and  published  in 1879,  in which  the  authorregrets that  nothing has been  done to put  our pro-tectorate in force.  In the  course of his  argument hereviews the whole history of the  idea  of connecting theEuphrates  with the Mediterranean,  and In lamentingthat England appears to have gone back on her oldaspirations, and he ends with this warning :       &quot; Mais que 1&apos;Angleterre y prenne garde ;  1&apos;ceuvre   qu&apos;elle  abandonnat ainsi serait  tot ou  tard  reprise   par d&apos;autres et reprise contre elle.&quot; (A. Kleczhowski,   &quot; LaTurquie d&apos;Asie et le Protectorat de 1&apos;Angleterre,    1879.&quot;)   8. Lord Beaconsfield&apos;s point of view is clearly oneof those  which the present  situation emphasises.  Oneobjection to  seeking to control  a line of junction withthe Euphrates is the continental responsibilities it wouldentail.  But assuming, again,  that it  is  intended toretain possession of Lower Mesopotamia, the continentalresponsibilities are there, and in  his view the establish-
merit of the new line of communication was  the bestmeans of meeting them.   9. Closely connected with  this aspect of the  case isanother that has to do with prestige.  It is admittedthat the power of  meeting continental responsibilitiesin the East is mainly a question cf the moral ascendancywe can  develop, and here we are likely to  be very weakas compared with Russia in the near future.  We areputting Russia into the most  famous seat  of Empire inthe  East,  allowing her  to  clothe  herself  in all  themajesty of  Rum, and  to take possession of  a  thronewhich,  in Oriental imagination, is  the highest of all.The inevitable results upon the relative standing of ourown. Empire need no labouring.    10.  Clearly it is our right and our duty,  if we sacrificeso much for the peace of  the world, that we should seeto it we have compensation, or we may defeat our end.And where  can such compensation be found in anythinglike so  much force  as in reviving the still  more ancientseat of empire in  the Middle East?   We must playBabylon against Byzantium.   But  this cannot be doneby merely occupying and bringing to life again the oldMesopotamia.   The ancient  empire must not only  be restored to  its wealth, it must be brought  to the snores of the Mediterranean.  The war is teaching us that the Mediterranean  is still, as it. always was,  the  centre of world politics, and it is there we must establish the gate of our new acquisition as a  counterpoise to the new weight that Russia is acquiring in the dominant area.     11. As has been our constant habit in building up the Empire,  we  have in this  case hung  back reluctantly for nearly a century from the increasing  burden of our destiny.  We have hung back, as we always did, till it is no longer possible wdth  safety to  avoid that destiny. We have never had cause to regret such a step when the moment was forced upon us, and everything points to another such moment being at hand.     12. It is understood that one of the chief objections to taking the necessary action now lies in the suscepti- bilities of  France.   In  this connection also  there are certain new considerations which were not in the field when,  for instance, Lord Palmerston gave Avay  in face of Napoleon III&apos;s opposition.  In the first place it is  for consideration, whether Syria means so much in  French imagination as it did before the  recent  extensions of her empire in North  Africa.  Assuming this is so, we are now perhaps in a better position to ask her  without offence to  assent  to the desired acquisition of  a- small section of  territory north of Syria  in  return not only for our present help in her time of  trouble, but for all we have done in  assisting  to consolidate her North African empire. In that she has acquired by our help a very large  share of the crumbs which are falling from the Turkish table.     13. Nor is this all.  Is it not possible to represent to  her that a counterpoise to Russian prestige  is as necessary for her  in Syria as it is  for  us ?  It might possibly be submitted that, while  neither of us can do this effectually single-handed, we can do it &quot;side by side.      [420J
    14. Finally, it is to be urged as a special concern ofthe Admiralty that whether or not the  obstacles in theway of carrying out the policy suggested are insuperable,the issue is one  that must  have a  deep  and  lastingeffect upon our  naval position.   It is obvious that theconditions which will arise out of the dissolution of theTurkish  Empire must restore to  the Mediterranean allits old political importance ; and this will happen at  atime when, as a dominant  factor of  sea  power, coalis  giving way to  oil.    From   this  point of view,Russia  in possession of  the  Dardanelles will  haveall  the  advantage  of  her Black  Sea  supplies  ather back.  It is  therefore  vital  to our position in thedecisive area that we should have equally  accessible  asimilar supply.   With Mesopotamia  under our control,and with  access  to  it at Alexandretta, we have at ourfeet a  complete solution of the  new situation; for notonly should we have an inexhaustible supply in our ownhands, but we should have  it at  a point most desirablestrategically that is, at  a  point  most  remote from ourhome base.
