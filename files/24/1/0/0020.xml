Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  September 1915.SECRET.G.-20.COMMITTEE   OF  IMPERIAL   DEFENCE.Blockade and Contraband in the Levant.Memorandum by the Secretary:2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,           September 7, 1915.
BLOCKADE  AND  CONTRABAND  IN  THE LEVANT.r^70te--Technical details, such as the ships allotted to the various patrols, the precise    defensive arrangements at bases, the position of minefields, and  the various forms    and documents &quot;connected with the system-of permits and licences now in  con-    temnlation, have  been omitted from this Report.  Such  details, however, are    available, and can he furnished to the responsible departmental offices if. required.]    IT is thought that some account, obtained at  first hand, of the methods adoptedin the Eastern Mediterranean for the blockade of Turkey and for the suppression ofcontraband trade may be of value.    2. The objects of the naval measures are :     (1.) To prevent the enemy&apos;s submarines from obtaining supplies.    (2.) To interrupt the Turkish import and export trade.    3. Both these  functions  are  fulfilled by a  system  of blockades and patrols,assisted by an intelligence system extending throughout the Levant.    4. Among  the  suspected  haunts of  the enemy&apos;s  submarines  are  Smyrna,Chesme, Scala Nuova,  Budrum, Symi,  Kakawa, Strati, Tliasos,  Corfu  (the Emperor&apos;spalace).  Among other possible places  are Gythium,  Zea, Koumi (Eubcea), CapeSideri (Crete), Samos, Kalymno.                                THE BLOCKADE.    5. The British fleet is  responsible  for the  blockade of the Turkish coast from theentrance of the Dardanelles south to latitude 38o30&apos; N., including the Gulf of Smyrna,the entrance to which is mined. A mixed force, including an old battleship, a cruiser,destroyers,   fleet-sweepers,  boarding-steamers,  trawlers,  motor-launches, -and anextemporised mine-layer, is responsible for  the blockade, and is  based on Port Iero, inMitylene Island.    6.  Guns aud searchlights have been landed at  Port Iero; a  signal station has beenestablished at the entrance; anti-submarine defences have been  extemporised ; patrolsare maintained in the approaches; and merchant-vessels (composed wholly of local sailingcraft) are examined before being allowed to enter.   In fact, if Port Iero were a Britishharbour, no greater liberties could  be taken.  There is, however, no cable censorship,though,  in  connection  with  the operations commenced on  the 6th August in  theGallipoli Peninsula, cable communication had to he interrupted.   The local inhabitantsare entirely well-disposed, and the protests of the Greek  officials are merely formaland academic.    7. The blockade is probably effective, except  for the passage of a few caiques tothose islands which can be reached in the course of a single night.  The acturl zonewithin which the blockading craft operate is from the southern limit to Cape Baba,between which and the Dardanelles there is no Turkish port.    8. From latitude 380 30&apos; N. to the Straits  of  Samos  the blockade  is carried  outby a Erench force composed  of cruisers, destroyers, and armed  sweepers.  This forceis also based on Port  Iero.   In addition to  carrying out a  strict blockade of  thelurkish coast from latitude 380 30&apos; to the Straits of Samos it patrols an area betweenthe above latitude and a line Cape  Malea-Santorin-Piscopi-Marmarice,  and moreespecially the Doro and Mykoni channels.  There are also a number of Erench armedtrawlers based on Port Iero, which operate with drift-nets in and around the Gulf ofSmyrna.      [1013]                                                         B  2
    9. The blockade of the coast of Turkey south of the Straits of Samos has onlybeen proclaimed within the last week or two, and is carried out by the French Navy.                              THE NAVAL PATROL.    10. In addition to the  above system of blockade there is  a regular  system ofpatrols, which will now be described.    11. The whole of these patrols are now  under the  general  supervision  of theofficer commanding- H.M.S. &quot; Doris.&quot;    12. The Northern Patrol works in the Northern iEgean, and is carried out in themain  by armed boarding steamers, or similar craft, based on Mudros.   This patrol isdivided into two sections, viz.:     Section A. The Gulfs of  Salonica, Kassandra, and Monte  Santo southward to         latitude 390 35&apos; W.    Section B. East  of Cape  Laura (Mount Athos)  and north  of  the  line  Capo         Laura Cape Gremea (near Enos), including the island  of Samothraki.    13. The object of the northern patrol is to prevent contraband trade with Turkeythrough  Greek  and Bulgarian  ports, especially  Salonica and  Dedeagatch, also tosearch the coast for submarines.    14 The consuls at Salonica and Dedeagatch are visited about every twelve days.    15. All ships carrying mineral oil or lubricating oil when  captured are sent toMudros.   Ships captured  when carrying rice to Dedeagatch are sent to Mudros unlessthe cargo is consigned to firms  on the  consuls  list.  Ships carrying  contraband orstores of military value other than the above  for  Bulgaria, Greece, or lloumania arcdetained and sent to Mudros for examination.  Consignments to certain  named firmsin Salonica are  exempt.   Prize crews and an interpreter are carried by the shipsemployed on these patrols.     16.  In the Gulf of Xeros the patrol is carried out  by a destroyer, which, besidesan occasional search of the island of Samothraki  and the north coast of the Gulf, hasstill more important duties to perform, which it is unnecessary to specify here.     17.  The Southern Patrol, carried out by a force of  cruisers  and armed boardingvessels based on Mudros, extends south of that port to  latitude  38Q 30&apos;,  and includesoccasional visits to the Doro Channel.  The duties of this patrol  are :      (a.)  To patrol the transport route, which is laid down from  time to time by the           Commander-in-Chief of the French Fleet.     (b.)  To visit the islands of  the Skopelos group (north of  Euboea), Skyros, Strati,           and the coast of Euboea.     (c.)  To search with their boats likely localities for submarine supply depots, and,           by establishing friendly  relations with Greek fishermen and lighthouse-           keepers, to create an intelligence system.     (d.)  To visit and search steamers and sailing vessels for contraband.     18.  A fleet sweeper is usually maintained in the neighbourhood of the Piraeus tohoard vessels west of the Doro Channel, and to be ready to act immediately on receiptof information from  the  British Minister at  Athens,  with  regard to  submarinesrevictualling, &amp;c, in  the  neighbourhood.  The  British Minister communicates  withthe fleet-sweeper by means of a motor-boat.                                  INTELLIGENCE.     19.  The above system of  patrols is supported by  a  special intelligence system,which is supervised by Mr. A. T.  Waugh, of the  Levant  Consular Service, nowemployed as commercial attache at Athens, where he has  the  assistance of a highly-expert  staff.   There are local  branches of  this  system  at Salonica, Dedeagatcb,and (I think) Kavalla.  Not long ago a  reward, of 2,000/. was advertised in  theprincipal Athens newspapers for information leading to the destruction of an enemysubmarine.
                          DECISIONS AS TO CAPTURES.    20  In a naval sense these measures are very effective, and considerable numbers ofships have hitherto been brought into Mudros for examination.  At Mudros the decisionas to whether they shall be sent to the Malta Prize Court or released unconditionally,or whether the cargo  is to be landed, rests nominally with Admiral Wemyss, who isthe  Senior Naval Officer of the port.   It is, however, impossible for this officer, whohas  innumerable executive duties to carry out, to give much personal attention to thematter, and until  recently this aspect of the arrangements was not satisfactory, as theAdmiral only had to assist him an ex-habourmaster from Constantinople, 70 years ofa^e  and more suited to the duties  of a  boarding-officer  than to  decisions on sotechnical a matter.   Recently, therefore, Major R. C. Temple, R.M.A., who was sentout for  intelligence duties, has been  allotted  to  assist Admiral Wemyss in regard tothe  disposal of cargoes.    21.  This duty is now a very important one.   Prom a  perusal of the  foregoingsummary it will be realised  how delicate  are the questions involved, and this will bethe  more apparent if the character  of  the emergency  trade through Salonica- andDedeagatch is examined.    22.  It must be remembered that  in  normal times the Straits of  the  Bosphorusand Dardanelles carry, not only the sea-borne commerce of Constantinople, NorthernTurkey-in-Asia, and Southern Russia, but also that of Bulgaria and Roumania.  Nowthat the Straits are closed, the sea-borne  trade of the-e two latter countries endeavoursto find a passage through such ports as  Salonica, Kavalla, and Dedeagatch.  Up to thepresent time, however, it has been difficult to secure that goods landed in these ports,even though nominally consigned  to  Bulgaria  or Roumania, shall  not be  passed  toTurkey.   In the case of Dedeagatch,  indeed, it may almost be assumed that anythinglanded, except under adequate guarantees, will go to Turkey, since the railway makesa loop into Turkish  territory  before re-entering Bulgarian territory, and Turkey isnot likely to let slip the opportunity of acquiring anything she needs.    23.  The responsible officer at Mudros, therefore, has a very difficult decision tomake in regard to each cargo.  On the  one hand, he is naturally reluctant  to releasecargoes which may be used  to supply the  needs of enemy submarines or to  furnishsupplies to the enemy.  On the other hand, he does not wish to interfere with innocenttrade, or to cause  unnecessary inconvenience and suffering  to a nation like Greece,which has stretched  friendly neutrality in favour of the Allies,  to limits which havebrought on her the malignant hatred  of our enemies.  Up to the  present the tendencyhas been to be  rather generous in the treatment of vessels brought in, and  to rely asmuch as anything on the deterrent effect of taking ships out of  their course in  orderto prevent the deliberate  running of contraband.  This, perhaps, is due as  much tothe difficulty in providing proof  which  would  satisfy a Prize Court, as  to  any othermotive.   In case of doubt, the cargo is  usually landed, and in  clue  course this willlead to claims for  compensation.                            THE EFFECT IN  GREECE.     24. Essential though it is to the safety of our warships and transports, the actionof our  cruisers has caused  intense resentment  in Greece, and to  this extent  hasassisted the machinations  of our enemies.   This  is  hardly  to  be  wondered  at.Athens, be it remembered, is not  yet  connected  with  Salonica&apos;by rail.  The  normaltraffic of Greece, with its deep indented bays and good harbours, is by sea.  Moreover,many of the islands  are  dependent for the means of existence on imported good*,and the trade is to a great extent  carried out by craft which,  in the ordinary wayot  business,  const from  island to island and on to the mainland.   The interruptionor the traffic, while a ship is being taken  to Mudros for examination, has therefore areally serious aspect to many of these people.P   i&quot;5nT0 m?ny  ottiers ifc is a orave  inconvenience.  It  is  stated that in one case a bti lTen.era1&apos;. returning from leave  to Salonica, was taken in to Lemnos, and several letacumeiits of soldiers have been taken there.   A Greek army officer on leave  fromiort  vTf1 stated-ln tlle writers presence that he had been ordered to return to duty a     nght earlier than would ordinarily be necessarv owing to the probabilty that his       [1013]                                    &quot;
 ship would he taken to Mudros.   It is hardly surprising, therefore, if a  good deal  of resentment is felt;  in fact, if there is any cause for surprise it is that the agitation has not been greater.     26. The real contraband runners and their German and Turkish abettors, have,  of course, not neglected to exploit so real and legitimate a  grievance against the Allies. Apart from these there is a tendency among quite moderate  people to  ask if this  is the reward for Greece&apos;s loyalty and friendly neutrality to our cause.                            THE GREEK AGREEMENT.     27. The  return of  M. Venizelos to power  has already to some extent allayed this discontent, and, wdiat is of more practical  importance, an agreement is about to  be  concluded with  the  Greek  Government by which, in return  for  certain concessions on our  part, including permission to export  currants and  tobacco to our enemies,  Greece undertakes to make her prohibitions  of   export  effective,  and to allow the Allies full facilities to assure themselves that this is the case.     28. If this arrangement works satisfactorily, it will not only have the result of removing the friction with the Greek nation, but  will also very  materially relieve the navy in its patrol work.     29, There will  remain the question of Bulgaria.   Presumably, after the Greek arrangement  comes into operation, our men-of-war will receive instructions to let pass  ships bound to  Greek  ports, even if they have  on  board  contraband cargo consigned  through a Greek port to a Bulgarian destination.    In fact, we  shall rely on the Greek  prohibition of export and  not on the action  of  our  warships.   It  is very important  to ensure  that the agreement will secure prohibition of export to unlicensed goods consigned to Bulgaria or Roumania,  even if they have been allowed to pass by our patrols.   Otherwise the  interruption  of trade will  be almost as great as ever. Ships bound for Dedeagatch, however, will still be suspect, and if carrying contraband or goods of possible  military value to the enemy will be brought into Mudros.     30.  Moreover, it will he impossible to avoid a certain amount of interference with Greek trade, since it will be necessary to keep a close eye on  all  consignments of  oil, whether fuel or lubricating, in the island traffic.   It is difficult  to  see how this is to be avoided, though something might be gained if  the Admiralty could define, for  the use of officers engaged in  patrol work, the precise  brands of oil capable of use in submarines.     31. In Athens it is earnestly desired that a  similar arrangement may be concluded as soon  as possible with Bulgaria.     32. The position of  the British Legation at  Athens, on  which will fall, among other things, important  duties in connection with the issue of  licences and permits to import prohibited goods to  Greece, and to re-export them to  Servia, Bulgaria, and lloumania, renders it important that the British Minister should be kept very well posted in regard to the political  situation in all  parts of the Balkans.  At times it might be important to take rather an indulgent view of consignments to Bulgaria,  for example, and  at other times it might be better to adopt a  stricter attitude.  It is  understood that a good deal has  been done within the last few  weeks to keep the various legationsin the Balkans in closer touch.    33. It is  also desirable that there should be a close  liaison  between the British Legation in Athens and the responsible naval authorities at  Mudros (Captain of the &quot;Doris&quot; and Major Temple). A visit by Major Temple  (or whoever is at the momentresponsible to  Admiral  Wemyss) to Athens,  or by  Mr. Waugh to  Mudros, would seem advisable in order to  concert the revised  naval orders consequential to the completionof the agreement.
