November 1915.SECRET.G-36.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Revictualling  of the  Serbian Army.Minute by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,             November 14, 1915.
REVICTUALLING OF SERBIAN ARMY.Secretary of State,     1. THE points  at present indicated as possible landing-places  for supplies areSan Giovanni and Oboti on tbe River Bogana.  Hence tbe stores bave to be conveyedto Scutari and there  shipped for passage across Lake Scutari to Plavnica.     It is not yet known whether the Bogana is navigable up to Lake  Scutari.  If so,much delay will be avoided, as supplies will then only have  to be transhipped at SanGiovanni and taken direct to Plavnica at the north end of  the lake.  In any case itseems doubtful&apos;whether the land route San Giovanni-Scutari can be used owing to itsliability to floods.    &apos;2. &quot;From : Plavnica a  practicable  road for  motor transport runs&apos; to  Matushevo-(40 miles),  where it bifurcates and  ends,  so far as motor traffic  is concerned, atAndrievitza (55  miles), and Kolashin (46 miles).     3. The formations which it  will  be necessary to provide from  military sourcesare :          (a.)- Inspectorate and staff.         (6.)- Transportestablishment.         (c.) Mechanical transport columns.         (d.) Communications unit.         (e.) Medical establishment.     4. It is considered that the Military Inspectorate should consist of : I         1 Inspector.         2 Staff  officers&apos;.         1 Assistant Director Medical Services.         1 Assistant Provost Marshal.         1 Liaison Officer to work with Montenegrins.         2 Liaison Officers to work with Serbians.     5. A Military Landing Staff will be required as follows :          1 Military Landing Officer.catf Brindisi or Durazzo.         1 Base  Commandant with 4 Military Landing Officers for San Giovanni  and             the river ports.     6. The following are the Army Service Corps requirements  so  far  as  can beforeseen :      (a.)  A supply establishment at Brindisi.     (6.)  A.S.C. establishment at San Giovanni.     (c.) Inland  Water Transport  establishment wherever it is decided that the Naval           responsibility ends, probably  Oboti.     (d.)  Main Supply Depot at Plavnica.     (e.)  Motor Convoys with at least 700 motors.     (/.)  Motor repair unit.     (g.)  Supply establishments at road termini.     The total number  of A.S.C. personnel is  estimated at 3,000 exclusive of locallabour.     7. Assuming that we shall be responsible for the medical supervision of suchlocal labour as is employed, provision must be made for a total force of at least 5,000.This involves the provision of :      (a.)  A Stationary Hospital of 400 beds.     (6.)  A Field Ambulance.     (c.)  An Advanced Depot of Medical Stores.     (d.)  A Sanitary Section.      [12331
    8. As the responsibility for the work of construction and maintenance of the roadsis now laid on the Army Council (vide Foreign Office letter  169386/15) it is proposedto employ Colonel A.  C. Macdonald, who it is considered  is eminently well fitted tocarry out this work.   This officer is at present serving in  France, and is, in privatelife, the head of Macdonald, Gibbs and Co.  The employment of this officer will obviatethe commission which would otherwise be paid to Sir John Jackson for the same work,and will, it is thought, be more satisfactory in other ways.    Colonel Macdonald will select his own staff of engineers.    It is also proposed that Colonel E. C. Seaman, R.E., now Chief Engineer in Malta,should go to Montenegro to arrange technical details.    9. The necessary steps to give effect to these proposals have been put in hand.                               (Signed)       A. J. MURRAY, C.I.G.S.,                                                            Lieutenant-General.    November 14, 1915.PMWEED AT THE FOREIGN OmOE BY C. E. HABBIBQN.-16/11/1915.
 SB C BB I.                      GOMMimS OF IMPERIAL DEVICE,                          2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W.      he accompanying memorandum was handed to the primeMinister &quot;by Lieutenant-General Sir William Robertson.. Itwas prepared for a meeting of the representatives of theAllied armies which is &quot;being called by General Joffre, andwas originally fixed for the 25th November , hut has beenpostponed to enable the Gsar to send an officer of sufficient-ly high rank from Russia.  Hhe memorandum was sent to Sir John French about ten days ago, but this is the first thathas been  heard of it in London.2.   If the document is studied it will be observed thatthere is considerable misunderstanding as regards the mach-inery for directing the war, so far as this country is con-cerned.  For example, the representatives of the  Englisharmy are asked to  inform the conference regarding a numberof questions with which the Commander-in-Chief of the BritishExpeditionary j&apos;orce in $ranee is not in the least concerned,such as, projects of the English higher command as far asconcerns the Balkans; the situation of the English army inMesopotamia; and the English views with regard to the con-  -quest of German East Africa.  ?hese are matters which con-cern the War Committee and the General Staff rather than theCommander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary jporee,  and ifthey are to be discussed at General Joffre&apos;s InternationalConference, it ought to be attended by representatives  cfthe General staff.   Sir John French,  therefore, instructedSir William Robertson to explain this  to  the authorities  athome.                        (Signed)     M. P. A.  HAUEBY.govember 151  1915.
