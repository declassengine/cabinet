Robertson, K.C.B.,                  K.C.V.O.,  D.S.O.^O52, Whitehall Gardens. S.W.,            November 8, 1915.
SECRET.MEMORANDUM  ON THE  CONDUCT OE THE WAR.    1. THE war may end either in the defeat of the Central Powers, in the defeat ofthe Entente, or in mutual exhaustion.    The object of the Entente Powers is to bring about the first of these results, whichcan only be attained by the defeat  or exhaustion  of the predominant partner in theCentral&apos; Alliance-Germany.   Every plan of operation must  therefore  be examinedfrom the point  of view of its bearing on this result.  If  it  is not, it will have a falsebasis, and will accordingly lead to false conclusions.    2. Obviously the most effective method of attaining the end we desire is to defeatdecisively the main German armies, which  are still on the Western front.   If it canbe proved that this is either impossible or more  difficult of  attainment by direct thanby indirect means, it is then right to have  recourse to subsidiary operations, providedalways that they lead to the defeat or exhaustion of our chief enemy.    3. It follows that the first questions we have to ask ourselves are :          Is the defeat of the German armies by direct attack possible ?         If not, can we bring about this defeat by indirect attack ?         What is the bearing of each of  the various campaigns to which we are    committed upon one result or the other ?    4. Leaving minor colonial operations out of account, we are now waging war infour theatres in Mesopotamia, in the Dardanelles, in the Balkans, and in Erance.     5. The campaign in Mesopotamia does not help  us towards our end, but neitherdoes  it employ troops which can  conveniently be used, owing to climatic and  otherreasons, in the Western theatre, nor does it cause an  appreciable  drain upon ourresources in  munitions.   Provided  that  these  conditions  continue, and  that thecampaign  does  not detrimentally affect  our financial position, it is  justifiable toexploit the successes gained in this theatre to the fullest extent, in view of the  reliefwhich the occupation of Bagdad may give to the general situation in the East.     6.  The operations in the Dardanelles and in the Balkans are presumably intendedto contribute to the defeat of the Central Powers.   They must therefore he consideredin relation to the main operations of the Entente.   Their justification and the amountof force which should be devoted to  them depends upon the answer to the question Is the defeat of the German armies by direct attack possible ?     7.  Briefly,  the history  of the war on  the  Western  front up  to  the  end ofNovember 1914 is one of effort on the part of the Erench and ourselves to prevent theenemy from turning our left flank.  In this we were successful, the German offensivewas definitely broken, and a defensive line was established from Switzerland to the English Channel.   The enemy then transferred his attacks  to the Eastern front, anddevoted his energies in the West to the strengthening of his position by every meanswhich skill and artifice could devise, until it was only possible to penetrate his defenceswhen an enormous quantity of high-explosive shell was available to batter the trenches and the wire obstacles in front of  them.  The effect of this was to create conditions without precedent in war.  There were no data available on which the amount of forcerequired to break through the cnemy&apos;s front could be calculated, and this could only be arrived at  by experiment.   The failure of the German efforts in  the West, an exaggerated estimate of  the effect of our naval blockade, and faith in the result of an offensive in the spring, which was not founded on an accurate idea of the amount of force required to pass from defence to attack, produced in England a  general feeling of optimism and expectation of an early and successful end to the war.    b. On the other hand, the long wait during the winter of 1914-1915, during whichwe were recovering from the exhaustion of the campaign of the previous  autumn,      [1202]                                      &quot;                      B
 were reorganising our forces, embodying  our reinforcements, and collecting sufficient guns  and&apos; ammunition  to  make  attack  possible,  caused a feeling  of impatience  in certain minds.  This apparently led  to the attempt to seek an easier solution  to the problem  by indirect attack through the Dardanelles.  The failure of this operation,. combined with the repeated and  unsuccessful attempts of the Erench  and ourselves to break  completely through  the enemy&apos;s front in the West, have produced a more than corresponding feeling of depression and dissatisfaction.    9. There  may be some excuse for this feeling in so far as  the  Dardanelles are concerned,  but there is none  as regards the position on the Western front, and such depression and dissatisfaction as may exist  are largely due  to an altogether false idea of what may be anticipated from  any given attack.  Each successive  offensive  of the Allies in the West is regarded as a failure  unless  it produces a decisive  result.  But the decisive defeat of 2,000,000 men on a  front of 100 miles  can only be brought about by prolonged effort, and cannot in the most favourable circumstances  be the consequences of one battle.    10. In war our own  difficulties and dangers loom large; those of the enemy are apt to be forgotten.  Because the naval blockade did not produce the effect expected of it last winter it has none the less  been very real and effective ; because the Allied attacks in the West have not broken completely through the  German defences they have not  been failures.  The drain upon German  resources caused, by the operations in the West has been great and  continuous.   An appendix attached to this paper gives a  comparison between those resources  last January, when they had reached their maximum development, and at the  present time;  by  this comparison,  the value of the operations of the last nine months can best be judged.    11. Since April last the initiative oh the Western front has been uniformly in the hands of  the Allies.  They have attacked wherever they chose and whenever the lengthy preparation required could be completed and the necessary store of ammunition had been accumulated.  Each attack has produced  greater  results than the preceding one, the last ending in the  capture of 80,000 prisoners and  120 field and heavy guns, a greater loss than German arms have sustained in any battle at any time since Jena. The statement given in the appendix clearly proves that in comparison with population the drain upon our resources  has not been great, while that upon German resources has been very  severe.    12. We have at present eleven New  Army divisions available as  reinforcements, the Germans have no new formations to bring into the field.  We are now beginning to receive the  heavy guns required, adequately to support  an attack on a large scale, and there is good  prospect that within  the next few  months  we  shall receive the number of these proportionate to our  strength in infantry.   For the  first time since the commencement of the war the supply of munitions on an adequate scale is assured. Hitherto our power to assist the French in their  attacks, and the extent of front on which we have been able to attack, has been limited chiefly by the number of guns and the  quantity  of  ammunition at our disposal.  We have not  yet made the maximum effort of which we are capable.  We are creating an  army during the war, and we are exceedingly fortunate in having the time to do this.   Ourold  divisions are full of recruits; our new and territorial divisions lack training and experience; thearmy  as  a whole  lacks  cohesion.    The personnel is magnificent, and  events  have- shown that, given training and  experience, both new and territorial divisions will be equal to any call likely to be made on them : but the creation  of an army is a slow business, which demands great effort and great patience.  It took Wellington  eight years to make the army which won Vittoria and entered Paris.    It is not of course possible to say that the next great attempt which we and the French may make will succeed in breaking through the enemy&apos;s successive lines, butjudging from past  experience there is  a reasonable certainty  of obtaining- such a measure of success as  will add greatly to the cumulative effect of past successes.    13. It is  sometimes argued that if we cannot be certain of driving back the enemy in a decisive battle, the only way for us to end the war is to kill off  Germans, which can  be better done  by awaiting  attack  than by  undertaking costly attacks ourselves.  This contains  a naif-truth.  It is quite  possible that we may end the war by exhausting Germany&apos;s  supply of men  rather  than  by inflicting  decisive
defeat on her armies,  but we  have no guarantee that the enemy will attack us ifwe sit still.  Germany has possession  of Belgium,  of  ten  Prench provinces, and ofPoland.  She is obviously satisfied that she is not  likely to increase  materiallythese gains  for  the present,  or  she would not  have embarked  cn her  Balkanenterprise in preference  to dealing with her chief  enemies.   If we remain inactivewe leave Germany free  to employ her resources  in  extending  her  gains, so thatshe may have  still more booty with which to  bargain at  the  Peace  Conference.On the other hand, Germany cannot afford  to have her front broken, because it is notpossible to measure the extent of the disaster which  this might entail, and because herfuture depends largely on her power to maintain the morale both of her armies and ofher people.   Time  aud again both we and the Prench have been near  enongh tomaking a break to frighten her  badly, and to cause  her to  put out her utmost effortsaarainst  our  attacks.   It is  in the earlv stages of  a  battle that  the attack  suffersproportionately heavy loss.  If  complete success is achieved and the  line is  broken,the losses of the defeated must at least approximate those of the victor. If the successis partial, the enemy&apos;s efforts to ward oil disaster cause him  losses which  go far toadjust the balance.  In the  recent battle  our losses on the Locs front  amount toabout 33 per  cent,  of the  fighting strength of the 175 battalions engaged.   So far thepreliminary German casualty lists, which are never complete, have been published for65 battalions which were engaged in the battles of September and October.   Theirlosses amount to 60 per cent,  of lighting strength.    14. There is,  then, no reason to despair of success by means of direct attack ou theWestern front; on the contrary, the prospects of ultimate victory are good.  We areonly justified in not concentrating our full resources on  the Western front if we findan easier road  to  success in a subsidiary theatre.  That possibility will now  heconsidered.    15.  The  object of the Dardanelles expedition was to open up communication withBussia through the Bosphorous, to force Turkey  to  make peace,  and  to bring in theBalkan States on our side.  This  object cannot now be achieved, and the force in thePeninsula has  no longer any  prospect of contributing,  directly or indirectly, tothe defeat of  Germany.   In  fact, the  operations are now without an object.  At mostthey occupy  a  number of Turks, some of whom  might eventually be used againstEgypt, while  the upkeep  of the force entails  a  heavy drain upon the resources whichought to be used  against our chief  enemy.   Withdrawal  from  the enterprise istherefore the best course, provided it is possible  and does not produce a condition ofthings elsewhere which might  necessitate the employment of a larger force than issaved from the  Peninsula.    16. The  recommendation as to the possibility of withdrawal  must come from thecommander on the spot, but it is hardly conceivable that a considerable portion  of theforce could not  be got off, while by remaining there is a very  serious danger that wemay lose the  whole.  Communication between  Austria  and  Bulgaria  by way of  theDanube has already been  established, and we may  expect any clay  to  hear  that  theNish-Adrianople Bail way is in  the enemy&apos;s hands.   In a few weeks at most Germanywill be able to keep the Turks  supplied with ammunition, heavy guns, and possibly gas.     Experience has taught us that,  given sufficient  guns and  ammunition, any frontsystem of defence can be broken.  It is the depth  of  the  cnemy&apos;s defences and thepower of bringing  intact  reserves up quickly to  occupy rear lines which make attackdifficult on the Western front.  There is  no depth in the  Gallipoli defences, andtherefore the chances of  resisting a determined   attack, supported by adequateartillery  and the employment  of gas  (probably of  a  new kind),  appear to be verysmall.     17. A  reasonable prospect  of such a success  as would enable us to increase thedepth of our defences in  the Peninsula might afford  some justification for remaining,on the grounds that we would then avoid an open confession of failure and its effect onEgypt and  India.   The chances of such  a  success  must also be determined by thecommander on the spot,  but since this success would not contribute to the object ofthe war it would be wrong, in  order to obtain it. to divert forces from theatres whichdo affect the main issue.     18.  Withdrawal would  certainly entail loss,  the extent of which cannot  beestimated here, but once we  have left the  Peninsula our losses would be known, the
 present wastage on an extraneous objective of men and munitions, the extent of which cannot be measured as long as tbe operations  continue, would cease, and  the troops withdrawn would be available eventually for employment elsewhere.    19. The moral effect of the withdrawal on the Eastern hemisphere in general and in particular upon  Egypt and India may easily be exaggerated.  Is it, in any  case, likely to  be greater  than the effect  of  the destruction  of the force ?  In India we have&quot;  a considerable white force with adequate  artillery, and  we hold as hostages outside their country a large portion of  the Native Army.  An attack upon Egypt either by the Turks alone or by a combined German and Turkish force, must entail months of preparation of  which we shall have timely notice.  Without full knowledge of the local conditions it  is not possible to say more, but it must  be remembered  that the defeat of Germany will secure Egypt and all our other possessions, while our defeat by Germany will give her Egypt and anything  else she chooses to take.    20. As regards the  Balkans,  there  is nothing to be gained by  repeating the arguments for and against the enterprise, as we are now committed to it.   We must be quite  clear, however, that these operations can only assist us  to our end  and in the most favourable circumstances, and then  only very indirectly.  If we and the Erench succeed in  keeping the Serbian Army intact we  may enable it to continue to  keep in the Balkans the ten German divisions now engaged there.  To produce this result we and the Erench have already undertaken to employ  eight  divisions, and we  have agreed upon a definite r61e.  But it must be realised that  the eventual extent of our commitments will  depend not only on  our  wishes, but on the action  of the enemy. Serbia may be forced to make an early peace.  Greece may come in against us.  Our detachments in Serbia may be defeated by the Bulgarians.  The Erench may be led on,  get into difficulties, and compel us to come to their help..   These are all eventualities which may arise  and must be  provided for, so  that none of  them may take us by surprise.    We may say,  &quot; Thus far shall we  go  and no  further,&quot;  but whether we can adhere  to that determination or not depends on circumstances altogether  beyondour control.  The essential measures for the conduct of this campaign are that Greeceshould be compelled to define her attitude so that, in that respect at  least, we  mayknow  how we stand; that we and the Erench should examine together every step wetake with reference to its  bearing on the war as  a whole;  that every detachment whichdoes not help to the defeat of Germany must be made for the shortest possible timeand in the minimum strength;  and that  possible further developments should beforeseen and plans made to meet them before they  arise.    21. To summarise the preceding paragraphs : -    The  main facts of the general situation are that the enemy&apos;s offensive on bothmain  fronts has failed ; that the strain on his resources, human, material, and economic,has been very severe ; that  he  has  passed  his climacteric while we have not yetreached ours.  He has, however, the advantage  of holding large areas of Ententeterritory, which, if he can continue to hold them, place him in a favourable positionas a bargainer at the end  of  the war.  As  he  has been unable  to compel peace bydirect attack he has embarked on a subsidiary enterprise, in which success  appears tohim to be  easy, with the object of weakening  his opponents by indirect means; ofraising the spirits of his troops and people; of  depressing  the  spirits of  his enemies,and of thereby making them ready  to accept peace.    22. Erom the point of view of the Entente, the campaign in the Dardanelles hasfailed in its object and can no longer help to the defeat of Germany, and the  campaignin the Balkans can, at most, assist very indirectly to that end.   On the other hand, weand the Erench  have gained positive results on the Western front, and if the  taskbefore us  there is serious and progress slow, there is no shorter cut to victory in sight.That  being so, Erance and Flanders must continue to be the principal  theatre of war,and on it our main efforts must be concentrated.    23. There is one aspect of the  war which has not yet been  touched on.  We  andthe  French are in superior numbers to the enemy on the Western front, but owing tothe  exhaustion of the French ammunition supply there is no prospect of our renewingthe  offensive on a large scale for some time.   That being  so, it is argued that nothingwill be lost by transferring troops from  France to other theatres during the winter.      [1202]                                                      &quot;    c
This argument cannot be sustained, for apart from technical questions of organisationand equipment and of the time which these involve, and apart  from the fact that theenemy  may interfere with our  plans, the factors of distance and of facilities formovement make  it possible for the enemy to disengage his troops from Servia longbefore we and the French could do the same.     Further, it should be remembered that we need to have as many troops as possiblein France so as to have ample  opportunities for giving the training which is so muchneeded; to be able to find frequent  reliefs for troops in the trenches and thus toreduce wastage; and  to be able constantly and relentlessly to wear down and exhaustthe enemy by minor attacks.     24.  There is  still another reason against depleting the  forces in France.  TheGermans have recently  transferred ten  divisions from the Eastern to the Westernfront, we and the French are in process of sending away ten (including the two Indiandivisions).   Our  relative superiority over  the enemy will therefore  be reduced  for atime to the extent of nine corps, since the new divisions will not all be assembled for manvweeks, and then require  long training before they are fit to  be used.  We  may hopethat this alteration in  strength is not  sufficient to cause us to fear  that the enemycan gain any far-reaching success.  There is, however, always the possibility that theenemy may seek to clinch  a victory in the Balkans  by attempting to  gain a  localsuccess on our fronts.   There  are already some indications that he may be  preparingfor some such coup.   The French were unduly optimistic about the prospects of  theirlast offensive, and are now depressed because it did not give them all  they  expected.That is  the  French nature: it will recover  as  it has  in the past, but it is  veryimportant on all grounds that we should  not at the present juncture give the enemythe opening  he is seeking.   If Flanders  is unsuited for big movements  of troopsduring  the wet season, there  are many  parts  of  our own and the  French  frontsouthwards from the La Bassee Canal on which battles have been  fought in the pastduring the winter, and there are no climatic  reasons why this should  not be the caseagain.    These facts  should be  careiully  weighed before  deciding  on any furtherweakening of the Allied  forces in France.     25. The one touchstone by which all plans and proposals must be tested is  theirbearing on our object in the  war.   If it is agreed that the main theatre is on theWestern front, then in order to be strong there  we  must be prepared to  take  riskselsewhere.   No campaign was ever won by attempting to be safe everywhere.  It is acommon-place  of  war that local commanders and local authorities&apos;exaggerate theimportance and dangers of the immediate situation with which they  are concerned.It is the function of the higher direction to keep cleariy before it the  main issue andthe broad principles of the conduct of war, and to refuse resolutely to  be  drawn byany specious pieas of local urgency from the course on which  it has deliberatelydetermined.    26. It is not  sufficient to be clear as  to the object of the war and to have settledwhere our main effort is to be made; we  must also have the machinery for puttingthese decisions into practice.  One grave defect in the conduct of the war  up to thepresent day has been lack of this  machinery.  We are new  conducting four distinctcampaigns, and we hold in England large disposable reserves.   It is essential in thesecircumstances that there should  be one  military authority responsible  for advisingHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government regarding  military  policy in all  theatres.  The officerselected for this all-important po-^t must  be trusted by  the Government to carry outhis duties without interference,  and if he cannot be so trusted he should  be  replaced.Experience  has shown that  in a war of the magnitude of  the present one  it  isundesirable to combine in one person the  functions of supreme military adviser and ofWar Minister.  In our case it is  especially  undesirable to  combine  these functions,because we are engaged in the stupendous task of raising large armies during theprogress of the war.        We must also have efficient machinery for determining the  general policywhich will  guide the military authority.   Unless  this is forthcoming  it is  futile tolook for success, no matter how good the  work of  the naval and  military advisers  may-be.  If, as  is sometimes  said, the  British system of government is  unsuited to theconduct of  war, then it must be amended for the period of the Avar.  It is not possibleto carry on war in an efficient manner if  each of  a  considerable number of  men has
authority to make plans, to endeavour to convince his fellow members of the soundnessof his views, and to  search for those who  are prepared  to  carry  out his  plans.  Towhat extent the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility should and could bedelegated to a small body is a question which lies outside the scope of this  paper, butthere is no doubt that, so far  as the  conduct of naval and military  operations isconcerned, prompt decision and  prompt action are required, and for  these a smallresponsible body is essential.    28.  Once established, this  authority must make itself felt,  and  it  is  of firstimportance that it should set itself to restore confidence  in  the country.   This paperlias endeavoured to show that  there is no justification for the  wave of  depressionwhich appears to prevail in many quarters.   Morale is a vital factor in war, and wefind that depression  at home is beginning to be reflected in the army in Erance.  Thatarmy is now largely composed of officers and men who are ignorant of what must beexpected in war, who are therefore confronted with strange conditions in circumstancesof great  difficulty, who read the  papers, think for themselves, and are in close touchwith feeling at home.   If every  wild story which comes from  Erance is  believed, ifthe public are consequently looking  for imaginary disasters, if the enemy is creditedwith superhuman wisdom and efficiency, if our successes  are belittled and our failuresexaggerated, the effect on the prosecution  of the Avar may be disastrous.  What isrequired is a clear and reasoned  appreciation of tbe task  in front of  us, of  our powerto meet it, and equally a clear and reasoned appreciation of the enemy&apos;s task  and  ofhis difficulties.    29.  We also need to take hold of the war as a whole  to a much greater extentthan we have done  in the past.  Our  stake in  the war is as great as that of theFrench,  we have now  a great army  in the field, our  navy is all-powerful, financiallywe are the dominant partner.   The  supreme military  authority at home must be indirect and constant touch with  the supreme  military authority  in  Erance, and weshould insist on the  effective  co-ordination of our plans and  those of the Erench.  Theother Allies may ne inA&apos;ited to  join later, but the immediate necessity  is effectiveco-operation between  ourselves  and the French, and  Ave must satisfy ourselves thatfuture proposals made by the French are based on sound reasoning, and are in agree-rnent with the main Allied plan  of  operations.  Victory is  assured  to  us  if  only wemake a reasonable and appropriate use of our superiority in men, money,  munitions,and ships.  We cannot make this use unless we have a carefully-considered, complete,and accepted plan upon which both  countries can base their action.    November-5, 1915.APPENDIX.          NOTE ON THE MILITARY AND ECONOMIC POSITION OF GERMANY.    1. THIS subject naturally divides itself into three heads resources in personnel,economic life of the nation, and morale of the people.    2. There can be no doubt that the policy of attrition pursued by the Allies hasalready produced important  results, and  that  Germany has trenched deeply on  herreserves of personnel.    The first five months  of the  war showed  a constant  and rapid increase  of  theGerman army, the  670 battalions maintained  in peace rising to 1,854 by January.19L5.   The new units  had been formed and casualties had been  filled from Reserve,Ersatz, and Laudvvehr troops, supplemented by Avar volunteers,  who were almost all inthe prime of life and  who  had,  in  the  majority of  cases, served previously  in  theregular army.   The   1914  Class, Avhich would  normally have come  out on  the1st October, 1914, had anticipated  that date in only a few of the Army Corps districts.and on the 1st January it was trained and ready to leave the depots.  Its  numberswere, very large, as it included not merely the men born in 1894, but also the surplusfrom  the  three previous years&apos; classes, \vhiie the whole of the untrained Landsturmand the 1915, 1916, and 1917 Classes lay untouched behind it.    3. In January Germany had thus reached her culminating  point.   Since that dateno new corps have been created, though many new divisions have  been formed out ofold materials, by cutting down  the majority of the pre-existing divisions from four to
three regiments and by reducing the amount of  divisional field artillery.  The soleeffective increase, since January, of the field army mas dieen that, due to-the creation ofthirteen new.regiments (Nos. 183-J.90, 192, 493, 24 and 25 Bavarian, and 122 -R.), andof a large  number ol: foot artillery batteries, armed in many eases-with guns takenfrom the Russians, machine-gun. sections, and Minenwerfer detachments.    4. The cessation in the formation of new units points to the  exhaustion of thematerial from which they were formed, and there are now.many signs that Germanyis finding a difficulty in  providing drafts  to keep up her establishments.  When the.1914 &apos;.Glass commenced to deave the depdts, ithe younger classes of the untrained-Landsturm were called up, and by May the whole of the 1915 Class was in the depots,and older classes of the untrained Landsturm  had been embodied.    .5. The heavy losses  accompanying the French offensive in Champagne in April,and the British  and French operations on the Festubert  and  Arras fronts in  May,added to those attending  the German. advance in  Galicia,  caused a very heavy drain,so that by July the T916 Class was called  up, and all the I Ban untrained Landsturm(up to  39,years of age) had beentembodied.   By August, as a result of further lossesin the West and the exceedingly heavv losses on the  Russian front, the recruitingproblem became. serious.   The IT Ban untrained Landsturm (up to 45 years of age)was called up, the 1917 and 1918 Classes were mustered for medical examination, and,more significant than all,-those  men who  had previously been declared permanentlyunfit for service were subjected.to re-examination and drafted during October in largenumbers into ithe depots.    6. Any estimate of the exact number of men still remaining in reserve in Germanyis liable to error, as there are so many unknown factors, and these factors themselvesare liable to alteration by modifications of the recruiting  and other laws.  The out-standing features, however, are      (a.) Germany has now exhausted all  her men  between 19 and  45 years of age           who  are fit for military service, except those retained  in  employments           necessarv to the State;    (b.) She has drawn numerous volunteers from boys of 17 and 18 and from men of           over45 years  of age;    (a) And she has been compelled  to gather in those previously exempt from service           on the ground of permanent incapacity.    -Thatthis is no fancy picture is proved by numerous detters found on prisoners andelsewhere.  Thus, in.a letter dated Ludwigshafen, 17th September,  1915, the  writersays: &quot;It seems quite empty  and deserted here.   Thedast few men are being  calledup.  Those who  were  previously rejected and  are quite unfit are being mustered, andthey are apparently all to be taken.&quot;   Similarly, in a letter from Benzlau dated the6th October, 1915, the correspondent writes :  &apos;:Tf you could see all those that aretaken the hunchbacks, cripples, and  people of that sort!&quot;  The pay-books found onGerman prisoners  have shown many instances of  men over 41 years of  age and not afew boys under 17.    7. Notwithstanding the above measures, some of whi3h were never contemplatedby the authorities before  the war, Germany has been unable to keep up her establish-ment in the East.  One of  our officers reported from Petrograd,  on the 22nd October,that the effectives  of the German companies  in  front of the 3rd  Russian  Armyamounted to only about 50,per cent, of establishment, and  prisoners have stated thatno attempt-is being made,to keep the companies in the East at a higher effective than60 per cent, of establishment.     Another sign of the  shortage of  men is that prisoners taken from the Allies arebeing largely used in factories  and in agricultural employments in Germany, and thatBelgian workmen are being sent to Germany for similar employment.     8.  A short comparison of  the drain on the resources of the British and  GermanEmpires may-mot be out of place.     On the 28th October the Prime Minister  stated  that the total  British casualties,including those of the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand,  South African, and Indiantroops, amounted to:just short of half a million men.  The white  jropulation of the Empire, according to &quot;The Statesman^ Year Book,&quot; amounts  to at least 63,000,000.Our losses consequently  amount  to only about 0&apos;8 per cent, of the  white population,and this figure is arrived  at by counting the Indians as white troops.  On the otherhand,  the  German Official Casualty Lists up to.No. 367 Prussian, and correspondinglists of other: States, published on the 30th October,  admit  2,263,221 casualties,  whichprobably do not apply to  a date later  than  the beginning of October, and are certainly
 considerably less than the-total casualties suffered.  This total is probably not less than 3,000,000 up.to date.  The white,;population of the German Empire on the 20th June, 1914,&apos;was estimated to be just under 68,000,000,.thus.giving a loss.of 4*4 per cent, or over five and a half times that. oLthe -British white population.    9. The. shortage of horses is even greater than that of men.   A recent order of the 3rd German Army states that it is no longer possible to maintain the establishment of horses with units  at  the front from those available  in  Germany.  It deprives  all departmental officers  of  their chargers, reduces the number allotted to staff.officers, and cuts down the teams  in infantry and light and  heavy ammunition columns from six to,four, and of  field kitchens, and wireless telegraphy  waggons from four to two. In Russia it is reported that many of the cavalry-regiments.have been dismounted.    10. As regards the  economic condition, the export trade has almost ceased to exist,  food  prices  have  risen greatly, vexatious  regulations  have  been  enforcedrestricting the sale of bread,  meat, and other necessaries of life, the  great shippingindustry, one of the,chief sources of Gerroany&apos;s commercial prosperity, is at a completestandstill, and  it is only the factories which are supplying war munitions that areflourishing.    In September the &quot; Vorwarts&quot; publishedthe following comparison of the  pricesof meat in Germany and in England:  	Germany.	England.Beef steak .. .. per lb. Veal ... .. ,, Mutton .. .. ,, Pork	M. 1-.41 1-44 1-47 1-89	M. 0-90 0-94 0-89 0-84    Pork has specially increased in price.   In August 1914 it varied between 1*52 M.per kilog. at Danzig and 2T8 M. per kiiog. at Cologne,  while  in  August  19.15 it hadrisen to between 2&quot;80 M. per kilog. at  Danzig and 378 M. per kilog. at Cologne.  Butteris  abnormally high, the commander  of the IXth Army Corps  District  has fixed itsprice  at  260 M. per lb. in Hamburg, Lubeck, &amp;c, while at  Hanover the  maximumprice has been put at 2&apos;80 M. per lb.    11. An Imperial Eoodstuffs Prices Control Office was formed last;month, and the&quot; Erankf urter  Zeitung&quot; of the 19th  October, in an apparently inspired article, saidthat the new authority was entering on its duties at a grave juncture: &quot; for it.cannotbe denied that great dissatisfaction is being widely felt at the present state of the foodsupply.  The prices of important articles of foodstuffs have been forced up to such anextent that they have become a luxury, so&quot; far as the  masses of the population areconcerned.   It  is imperative for economic and political reasons to put a stop to this,and if  this cannot be achieved by means of ordinary price regulations, the authoritiesmust not shrink from the extension of the bread-ticket system to other articles offoodstuffs.   The principle that only those may obtain foodstuffs who are in appositionto  pay for them cannot hold good  in time of war.  At such time they must be appliedto  those who need them.&quot;    The &quot; Vorwarts&apos;&apos; published on the 19th October a  memorial on  the subject ofthe food supplies addressed by the German Miners&apos; Organisations to the ImperialGovernment, asking the latter to see that meat, lard, and fats shall not be monopolisedby the well-to-do who can afford to pay exorbitant prices.    This agitation has borne fruit.   On the 28th  October the Bundesrat publishedan order restricting the sale  of meats and fats, regulating the prices of fish and milk,and adjusting the prices of potatoes.    12. The prices of articles other  than foodstuffs  have  also risen.   Rubber ispractically unobtainable, even Government motor-cars are laid  up for want of  tyres.There is a great scarcity of petroleum.  A letter dated Lippstadt, the 20th October,1915,  states that only  half a litre per household can  be drawn  once a fortnight, whilstcandles are  scarce  and dear,  and soap, which  used to cost 18  pfennige, now  costs60.  The Aachen Town Council  has  introduced  petroleum tickets,  which will onlybe issued to those who can prove their need  of  oil.  Householders who have gas orelectricity in their houses will not be  allowed to have oil tickets.    13. There is a shortage  of many metals., copper is  scarce, chromium, nickel,, andother metals used in steel making are very difficult to obtain.   An Imperial Orderhas been, issued prohibiting  the  use of paints containing  white lead or I linseed. oil
for painting walls or fences.  There is a famine of al] kinds of. fats and  oils, and theGerman  chemists  are  busily  engaged  in  endeavouring to find  substitutes.  Wool,cotton, and many other necessary raw materials are lacking.    14. The drain of  men, the constantly growing casualty lists,  the  dearness  ofliving, and the restriction of the necessaries of life  have had a  much greater effecton the morale of the nation than  seems to be realised  by a certain  section of theBritish  pnblic.  Innumerable  letters have been found  longing  for the end of thewar, and complaining  of the non-fulfilment of the promises that it would end withthe capture of Warsaw  and the consequent overthrow  of the Bussian  army.  It isa  constant theme  that Prussia is far from  defeated, and that following the Russiansinto the heart of their  country involves heavy losses wdth no corresponding advantages.Pood  riots have occurred  at  as widely separated places  as Aachen  and  Kattowitz.in Silesia.   At the latter place, according to a letter dated  the 17th October, a crowdof angry women invaded the market place,  overturned  the booths, and, having brokennumerous shop wdndows, entered the mayor&apos;s  office to demand money  to buy food fortheir starving families.    15. The morale of the  upper and middle classes is undoubtedly higher than thatof the proletariat,  This &quot;is  largely  due to their confidence in the Government, to theircontempt of the Allies, caused largely by the accounts of  their shortcomings publishedby a section of  the  British pres*, aim  DJ  tne manner in  which the  German press,guided by the Government, does everything in its power to put the German positionin its best aspect.  It is only occasionally that a glimpse can be had of  the underlyingfeelings, and then chiefly from the &quot; Vorwarts &quot; and  other  Socialist newspapers.  Atthe end of September, however, almost all  the papers  published articles  begging thepublic  rot to believe stories of the Prench success in  Champagne, and to keep calm.The Socialist press gives  frequent evidence  of  the dissatisfaction of the masses at theprofits  made by the contractors for and manufacturers of war material.    16. On the whole  it is probably true to say that the morale of  the nation is onlymaintained even at its present level by the  constant accounts of victories published bythe Government and by the progress in the Balkans.  The great sources of moralstrength in Germany are the Government and the General Staff, which, besides theni-selves maintaining a high standard of courage and confidence, do all in  their power toenhance that of the people and the army.
