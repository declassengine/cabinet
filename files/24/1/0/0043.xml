REPORT OF  A MEETING OF A SUB-COMMITTEE HELD AT 2,  WHITEHALL GARDENS                              ON NOVEMBER  12,  1915.    THE  Committee  desire to point  ont to His Majesty&apos;s Government  that  allefforts to secure possession, of German East  Africa, and to  overcome  the  resistanceof the enemy forces, have hitherto proved  unsuccessful.  They therefore recommendthat steps be taken to ensure the conquest  of this German colony with as little delayas  possible,  and  express  the opinion that. this  can only  be accomplished  by theassumption of a resolute offensive with an adequate force.    2. The numerical strength of the additional&apos;British&apos;&apos;force required to  undertakesuch  an  offensive having been discussed, the  Committee, as  advised by the  militarymembers present, approved  of the  general&apos;figure; of 10,000,  mentioned on  page 3 ofthe Memorandum  by the Chief of  the Imperial&apos; General Staff dated  the 8th October,1915.*    .3. The following reinforcements were rioted as promised by the Union of SouthAfrica arid already arranged for by the War Office :          1 brigade of infantry (South Africa)         4 mounted corps (South Africa).    ...         Cape&apos; bo^: s (4 double companies)         1 Indian infantry battalion         Artillery           Five batteries 13-pr. Q.F. guns          Four 5-4-inch howitzers          Two 5-inch howitzers                                                                      8,700    4. The Committee took note of  the request on the part of the Union Governmentthat the  1st South African Brigade, now in England, should be diverted to East Africa.The Chairman informed the Committee that this unit, having been specially  enlistedfor service elsewhere, was not available  for service in East  Africa.   The Committeerecommerid&apos; that&apos;a British Brigade1 from a New Army still in the United Kingdom,should be substituted for it, so as&quot;to Jrifake - up two1&apos; complete Brigades  of white troops.The total thus-&apos;  reached would1 amount to&apos;r&apos;T2j600,  which.&quot; the Comniittee were  advisedwould be adequate for the Offensive decided upon.    5V&apos; A&apos; coirsidef able1 tirrie must  be - consumed - in - the&quot; transport of  troops, and therainy  season begins&apos;5early in April,&apos; cohfeequeritly&apos; the time available for the  operationwill b&apos;e- short.   The Committee&apos;-&apos; consMer&apos;- therefore&apos; that&apos;&quot;it - is de&apos;sirable to  move the    *  It should be noted that this figure of 10,000 was held to include the reinforcement of  one brigade.referred to immediately before on page 3.

Unipn Government to proffer further assistance to make sure of success  during thefew weeks  that will be  available for active operations.  An increase in the number oftroops at our disposal would  inevitably  accelerate the  desired  conclusion  of theoperations.     6. In order to deaLefflciently with  such large numbers, a suitable General Staffand  Administrative Staff organisation is necessary, which at  present  is non-existent.The  Committee recommend therefore that such a staff should be sent from England assoon as possible, and should include officers with experience in dealing with SouthAfrican troops.     7. For the better furtherance of operations, the Committee are of opinion that theco-operation of the Belgians is desirable.  They consider that  this can  be secured onlyby placing a definite and  consistent policy before the Belgian military  authorities.They suggest therefore  that if  and when the present recommendations are  approvedand  a plan of  campaign has been decided on, the  main features  of  the plan  shall becommunicated to the Belgian authorities, and co-operation invited.     8. As explained in paragraph 5, every day now saved is valuable.  The Committeefeel  therefore that it is essential that an early decision on the proposals herein putforward should be given.                                       II.                            NOTE BY THE SECRETARY.   &apos;    In  the Memorandum (III) by  the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the factsaffecting the military -situation in  East Africa  are set forth.  The unexpected salvageof munitions from sunken or destroyed German ships in August 1915 seriously alteredthe balance  of  military  strength  in favour of the  Germans.   The  difficulties  ofmaintaining an effective blockade  along the coast of German East Africa are such asto make it possible for further munitions to be landed,  and for the German superiorityin this respect to be maintained.  Climatic influence has reduced the available numbersof our troops to such an extent  as  to make the outlook in certain  contingencies onethat calls for serious  consideration.   So  far the  subject has  been taken  up by  theForeign  Office, at whose instance  an Inter-departmental Conference has been held.The conclusions of this conference are contained in IV, on page 5.   In keeping with thesubmission in the last of  these conclusions, and following the recommendations in  theMinute  (V)  by the Director of Military Operations, it has  been thought  expedientto have the whole question discussed by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence.                                                                    M. P. A. H.    November 11,  1915.                                       III.         MEMORANDUM BY  THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL  STAFF.    Increase in enemy&apos;s strength. -The first  intimation that  the situation in  EastAfrica might become really serious in  the near future was given in a telegram fromGeneral Tighe dated 2nd August (No. 322 S.) in which he  laid special stress on thefact  that, according to intelligence reports,  the Germans  had salved 6 field guns,8 machine-guns, 8,000 rifles, and 6,000,000 rounds of ammunition from a collier whichhad been sunk by our men-of-war in Mansa Bay.  In confirmation of these reports hestated that the Germans had lately been using  ammunition of recent date.    He estimated that 12,000 African troops had  been levied by them since  April andthat they would have 20,000 armed men in the -field by the  end of the year if thereports of salvage were true.
     He supplemented that telegram by another, dated 14th August (No. 325), in which he made the following statements :      (1.) That four guns had been salved from the &quot;Konigsberg&quot; and that others  may also be salved shortly.     (2.) That a second storeship was believed to have run the  blockade and to be in Tanga  harbour.   In consequence there was no lack of ammunition in German East Africa.     (3.) That in consequence of the above the whole situation in German East Africa was radically altered.  The Germans might at that moment have 20,000 troops under arms and be greatly superior to the British in field and machine guns.     In his despatch, dated 31st July, 1915 (0165/6939), he made the following estimate of the enemy&apos;s strength :                            2,178 Germans and Austrians.                         15,000 to 20,000 natives.                             62 guns.                             67 machine guns.     The estimate of machine guns  is  probably  below the mark, as they have captured several British  &apos;303 with great quantities of ammunition.     The  British Forces.-Oa  1st  August the  British strength  amounted  to 3,070 British officers and  men, 14,078 native  officers and men (Indian and African), making a total of 17,148, with 23 guns and 56 machine guns.     In addition to  these, there were some 300 or 400 Europeans belonging to Volunteer Corps.     Two  howitzers with the necessary personnel have since this date arrived in East Africa, and  the Rhodesian Regiment has been increased by about 100 men.     The main British  concentration  is on the Maktau Mzima lines.   Maktau  is the present railhead of the railway under construction from Voi to Taveta.   The remainder of the forces are scattered along the Uganda railway and at - important points on the main routes into German East Africa.     The Indian  troops have been  found to be  very unreliable, and there have been several cases of self-mutilation.   Both Indian and European troops are suffering greatly from sickness.   General Tighe has  reported that  one  Indian Regiment, the  13th Rajputs, is suffering to such an extent from malaria and debility that &quot; they will never be of any  more  use  in the field.&quot;  He has asked that they may be replaced by another regiment from India.   Owing to the  inferiority of the Indian troops and&apos;the prevalence of sickness,  he  estimates that  his reliable infantry only  number 4,000, of which only 3,000 could  be concentrated on the Maktau Mzima lines.     He summed  up the situation thus (No. 325 of 14th August) :      &quot; Against such odds as  I have  now to  meet, if all  my  troops  were fit, I could probably hold my own, but owing to  the ever-increasing  sickness the reliable  infantry now only totals about 4,000, of whom no more than 3,000 can be concentrated in the Maktau Mzima lines.   Should the enemy make a determined advance  on these two lines, a contingency which I  regard as quite possible,  the situation would be serious.&quot;     During the  last  two months  the enemy has shown ever-increasing activity in raiding the Uganda railway, which  has been repeatedly blown  up,  and in attacking isolated posts.   On L4th August one of these posts was cut up.     It is evident that  a complete change in the situation became  apparent  early in August.   Before that  date it had  been General Tighe&apos;s intention to push on  the railway towards Taveta, and either  to attack  that  place or  to induce the enemy to attack him.  Since  1st August he has been compelled to  adopt a purely defensive role, and  is experiencing considerable difficulty in even maintaining intact his line of railway communications between Mombasa and  Nairobi and between Voi and Maktau.     Reinforcements. Authority has been given for increasing the Rhodesian Contingent to the strength  of a full battalion,  but  there is no  prospect  of obtaining more than 150 men (High Commissioners telegram of 15th September).     500 recruits for the Kings African Rifles are being raised in Nyasaland.     South Africa is preparing to send five 13-pr. batteries to East Africa.  It is alsoproposed to raise a Cape Coloured battalion, and to send a brigade to East Africa after
the October elections.  This last project is presumably  to  some extent dependent onthe political situation in South  Africa, and  in any case this reinforcement could notleave South Africa till the end of October.     It  is hoped  that  some additional  troops  can be raised within East Africa.  ARegistration Bill  has been passed.   The effect of this will, however, not be felt for sometime.     Belgian co-operation. The Belgians are at present rendering very little assistance.They have, however, invaded Ruanda (General Tighe&apos;s despatch of 31st July) and haveforced the enemy to  concentrate about Muanza.   This has allowed us to  withdrawtroops from Karungu.     They  appear to  be dissatisfied  with our attitude towards  them in  NorthernRhodesia.   We refused to allow them to invade German East Africa  from  Rhodesia,but  when  they  withdrew troops from our territory we demanded their  help.  Thisdiversion of strength has, according to them,  prevented their assuming the offensivenorth of Lake Tanganyika.     In view of this attitude, and since the British Naval expedition which is on its wayto the lake has not yet  arrived,  it is  improbable that  any resolute offensive  will beadopted by the Belgians for a considerable  time.     Summary of the situation. The Germans possess a very great advantage owingto their central  position and the  difficulty  of concerted action on  the part of theirenemies.  Their  interior communications  are excellent.   Their two  railways  fromDar-es-Salaam to Ujiji and from Tanga to  Arusha are connected by a good road fit formotors.  Muanza on Lake Victoria is also connected with the central railway by a goodmotor road.   Their concentration at Taveta is greatly facilitated by a rail or tramwaywhich has been constructed between Moshi on  the Usumbara railway and Taveta.  Bythese means the enemy can concentrate rapidly either  on Lake Tanganyika, on LakeVictoria, in the Taveta district, or on the coast.     The British  in  Rhodesia and East Africa have been reduced to the defensive andthe  Belgians  are inactive.   The Germans can therefore concentrate  superior  forcesagainst one of their enemies before the others can intervene.  There  is little doubt thatthey will make full use of their opportunity and that they will attack General  Tighe&apos;sforce in preference to the others, as an  invasion of British East Africa will be not onlyeasier but  offer  greater results than  an  attack upon the Congo or Rhodesia.  TheUganda railway  for a distance of 200 miles is at no point much more than 50  milesfrom the German frontier.     Their main attack will probably take place from Taveta against the Maktau Mzimalines.  This may  be accompanied by an advance on  Mombasa or on the railway by thecoast route  where the natives are hostile  to us and water is plentiful.   These attackswill probably take place simultaneously with  other  raids on the railway so as to drawoff our troops from threatened points.  Even if railway interruption were only temporary,the force holding  the Maktau Mzima lines would, for the time  being, be isolated, whileit was attacked by superior numbers.   This force once definitely beaten the  Germanswould be enabled to sever the  Uganda  railway and completely divide our forces.  Thissuccess  would probably be decisive and would entail  nothing less than the reconquestof the Protectorate.     Its moral effect throughout Africa would probably be so great that our militaryliabilities would be very largely increased in that continent.     The best opportunity fqr a German offensive would  be  during the  &quot; short  rains &quot;which continue from about the middle of November to the middle of December.  Waterwould then  be   plentiful on  the Maktau  route.   It would,  therefore, seem  that areinforcement should be sent to East Africa of  a strength  sufficient,  in  the opinion ofgeneral Tighe, to provide for the security  of the railway.  This reinforcement wouldprobably amount to at least  one brigade of reliable infantry, which should reach EastAfrica before the &quot;short rains&quot;  begin.   This  wpuld probably  suffice as a temporarymeasure, but in  order to render our  position permanently secure and to restore ourprestige in that theatre of war it  would be  necessary to  undertake an offensive againstGerman East Africa.   Eor this about 10,000 men would be required.   A success wouldprobably have the  effect of inducing  a large number of the  natives in German EastAfrica to join us and the enemy&apos;s position would then be so  weakened  that we couldafford to withdraw a large proportion of our forces.     In  stating the  reinforcements necessary to make British East Africa secure it isrealized that troops may not be available for this theatre  of war, and that the Govern-
ment may decide that General Tighe must do his best with his present command andthe reinforcements now being prepared.                                        A.  J.  MURRAY,  Lieut-General,                                               Chief of Imperial General Staff.    8th October, 1915.    Postscript. -Since the above was written the following telegram has been receivedfrom General Tighe :-(No. 348.)                                          8th October, 1915, 3.55 p.m.    (1.) The  Union Government have offered to send early in November for servicehere five batteries with ammunition column, Brigade Staff and personnel complete ; also10 per cent, reinforcements and 10 per cent, wastage every three months.  Shippingarrangements  are to be left to  the Navy.  From previous  correspondence I think thatthese will be four-gun, 13-pr. Q.F. batteries,    (2.) I trust that this splendid offer may be accepted.   At the same time it must bepointed out that even with the aid  of these additional batteries I have not sufficientreliable infantry to enable us to advance beyond my present positions.  If one brigade ofgood infantry  could be sent at the same time from South  Africa or elsew^..., 1 couldthen advance to Mbuyuni and Njoro and possibly further.  It is extremely c. r:      tomake such a forward move in the near future so as to co-operate with the Belgian attackon Ruanda (and possibly on Ujiji),  to recover our moral  ascendency  over the  enemyand to relieve  the present  menace to the Uganda Railway (yesterday the latter wasagain blown up and the mail train derailed).    (3.) If, in addition, mounted troops should also be available, they could be employedmost profitably on the Longido line.                                                          (Signed)     A. J.

IV.CONCLUSIONS  OF  AN  INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  CONFERENCE  HELD  AT  2,  WHITEHALL    GARDENS, S.W., ON NOVEMBER 8, 1915, AT THE REQUEST OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE,    ON THE SUBJECT OF THE BELGIAN  PROPOSAL  FOR A NAVAL DEMONSTRATION OFF    THE COAST OF GERMAN EAST AFRICA.                                   Present:        Vice-Admiral Sir D. A. Gamble, K.C.V.O. (in the Chair).             0        Lord Eustace Percy, Foreign Office.        Sir G. V. Fiddes, K.C.M.G., C.B., Colonial Office.        Major C. H. Leveson, D.S.O., War Office.        Captain Earl Percy, War Office. .            Mr. Cyril Longhurst, Assistant Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.    The following conclusions were reached :     (1.) The Committee  are  of opinion that a  demonstration without  an effective           landing would be useless,  and that the Foreign Office should inform the           Belgian Government accordingly.    (2.) Assuming any such demonstration, accompanied by a landing in force, were           decided upon, they  are of opinion that  it, or any other operation of an           offensive character,  should not be undertaken unless the troops now on the           spot even if  strengthened by the force promised in  the Union Govern-           ment&apos;s telegram of the 1st November were further  reinforced, either by           transferring the  1st Union  Brigade  from Europe  to  East Africa (as           recommended  by  the  Union Government) or  by  substituting another           brigade.    (3.) The Committee  submit that the  question of entire control of operations in           Rhodesia,  Nyasaland,  and  German  East  Africa   should  receive  the           consideration of the War Council.(Signed)DOUGLAS  GAMBLE,  Chairman.
Secretary, C.I.D.,    I THINK  this should be done.  Can you get it settled early ?                                            (Initialled)      A. J. M., G.I.G.S.    November 9, 1915.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGNOFEICE BY C. R. HARRISON.-26/11/1915.O.I.G.S.,     I  WAS unable  to  attend  the  meeting of  this Inter-Departmental Conferenceyesterday afternoon on account of the War Council.  It seems to me that this questionof future operations in East Africa requires to be thrashed  out thoroughly ; but, tostart with, the matter should be discussed, it seems  to  me, by a Committee such asassembled yesterday, acting as a  Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence,and  reporting to the Government.  It was on those lines that all the various secondaryoperations of the  war were started at the outset, viz., the  operations at Togoland&quot;,Cameroons,  German South-West Africa, in East Africa, and in the Pacific.     Hitherto we have been blowing  hot and cold  on the Belgians, at one time askingthem to help, at another  time discouraging them from  doing so.  Co-operation withthe Belgians has to be arranged with the Eoreign Office, which  is therefore concernedin the matter.   The question of Colonial forces to be supplied from South Africa hasto be dealt  with through the Colonial Office.   The Admiralty is concerned  in  anyprojects for  attacks on places like Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam, and is  also concerned inthe effort to  secure command of Lake Tanganyika and in controlling  our warships onLake Victoria.  Then there  is also the question whether  the control  of  operations inBhodesia and Nyasaland  should or should not be taken over by the War Office.  I donot think such an arrangement could be seriously considered unless we were preparedto send out a Superior Officer with a  properly constituted Staff to run the campaign asa whole.   To get the thing  on a proper footing, I should  like to have  these pointsconsidered by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence  representingthe different departments.
