SEPTEMBER  29.    60. On the 29tb September, when it was known that Mr. 0&apos;Beirnebad put forward the suggestion that the presence of our troops inMacedonia  might assist rather than hinder Bulgaria in her aims ifshe was with  uSjfl.ll change in the Cabinet had  been expectedwhich  would  have been favourable  to  the Allies. &quot; But in twofurther telegrams, despatched on the 28th September, Mr. 0&apos;Beirneexplained that the proposed rearrangement had broken down, and inparticular M.  Malinof  had refused to enter the Cabinet.  Whilethe King was anxious about the result of  the attitude of the countryto the mobilisation, he was  sceptical as to whether the EntentePowers would  or could send the 150,000 troops they had promisedto assist Serbia,  nor did he believe the  assent of Greece could  beobtained.    It  wras  clear,  however,  the  Eranco-British  promise   ofassistance had  made a profound impression; but, to  make it  good,it was essential that some British  or  Erench  troops,  if only aregiment, must be  despatched at once.   Mr. 0&apos;Beirne at the sametime,  gave  warning that King  Eerdinand&apos;s confidence  about theattitude of  Greece  was  undoubtedly due to private  information asto the intentions of King Constantine.    61. With regard to the preparations  for Salonica an Admiraltytelegram explained that a regiment of  Erench cavalry  was beingembarked at Alexandria for Egypt, and  the French Admiral hadorders to transport a division from Cape Helles to Mudros.  Thiswas understood on the spot to be premature, as arrangements mustfirst be made for safeguarding the Salonica anchorage.    Sir Ian Hamilton had explained he was preparing  the 10thand 53rd divisions and  a French brigade, which w7as all they couldspare.  The order for the French division to embark had been givenfrom Paris without consulting him.    62. With  a view to increasing the strength of  the expedition,General Maxwell had been asked what  mounted force he could sparefrom Egypt, having regard to there being now at sea four mountedbrigades equipped as infantry which could be diverted to Egypt tobe re-equipped as mounted brigades.                         33rd Meeting.    63. On these facts  the question of sending  troops to Salonicawas considered at the 33rd Meeting.   In face of the  equivocal    [1099-1]                                         B
attitude of Greece, as expressed in the telegrams Nos. 910 and 911,a general unwillingness was felt to sending  the  troops at all, solong as we had nothing official to  show except a statement  thatthey were not wanted for the present.    At the same  time  the moral importance  of sending some-thing at once was insisted on, especially if sufficient force, say twodivisions, to occupy the Vardar could be spared ; but on the otherhand it was recognised that the urgency could not  be measured tillthe full effect of the offensive in the West was  known.    The conclusion was to notify  Greece  that  we  could notproceed so long as we had on record a statement that troops werenot required, but the troops and transports were to be kept ready.The Admiralty and War Office were to continue their preparations,and British  and French Staff officers to go to Salonica to  preparefor a disembarkation.    The Greek  Government was also to  be  requested to affordnaval assistance for securing the Gulf of Salonica against submarineattack.    Pending a reply from Greece  further consideration was  heldover for a meeting fixed for the following day.    64.  Later in the day Sir  F. Elliot telegraphed that M. Venizelos Athens, No. 914,had assured him he was gradually consolidating his position with Sept. 29.the King, and had shown him a statement he was to make thatafternoon in Parliament that his policy was unchanged.  If Bulgariademobilised Greece would do  the same,  but ,she would defend  tothe last, not only her territory, but also her vital interests.  Thisdeclaration he said the King had approved.                         SEPTEMBER 30.    65.  A further long telegram from Sofia  concerning  the  pro- Sofia, No. 634,posed Russian ultimatum showed that its  delivery  could only have Sept. 29.the effect of bringing  the Opposition into line with the Govern-ment.  M. Malinof had in fact stated that he would support theMinisters in refusing demobilisation if the Allies  were to demandit.  This statement  was  the  more serious as  it  was clear theOpposition were  not yet powerless for  good.  Evidence of theunpopularity of the  mobilisation continued; our military  attache Sofia, No. 636,reported that it was going slowly, but he  also noted the presence ^Pt- 30-of German  and  Austrian officers,  who,  it was  feared,  alreadydominated the War Office, and that German officers would probablycommand armies and divisions.    . 66. At the same time the attitude of the Serbian Government Njsn  jfo. 408.was defined by a  telegram from Sir C. des Graz.   They wished to Received  Sept. 30,know what action the Allies were taking  at Sofia.  The progress 9 A&apos;M-of the Bulgarian mobilisation made matters urgent.  The troopshad orders not to attack, but they could not forgo for more than afew days the military  advantage they possessed in being  alreadymobilised.  They were  anxious  to await the action of the Powers,but military considerations must decide.    67. At Petrograd  they had no doubt what that action should Petrograd,he.   There they hoped  nothing  from the Bulgarian  opposition.   In No-their view it was powerless, and the  Germans were masters at Sofia, ^J*^f  Sept&apos; 30&apos;They  urged that  as the mobilisation would be complete  on the    A&apos;M&quot;6th October, the  ultimatum  ought  to be presented not later thanthe 2nd October.   Though Mr. 0&apos;Beirne considered the outlook inBulgaria improving, and that it was at least worth waiting on thechance of the  success of our offensive in France turning the scale,M.  Sazonof and the Assistant  Minister of Foreign Affairs  wereconvinced Bulgaria  was irrevocably bound to Germany.   Francetook the same view, merely  stipulating  for a  delay of forty-eight
               hours in presenting the ultimatum.  M. Sazonof  therefore pointed               out the grave responsibility England would incur if the ultimatum               were vetoed and Bulgaria proceeded to attack Serbia.                   To this  presentation of the case Sir G. Buchanan replied that               Italy at any rate  shared  our view,  so that opinion was equally               divided, and he therefore suggested that discretionary powers should               be given to the four Ministers at Sofia.   To this M. Sazonof agreed               in principle, provided the note wras drafted in firm language and               embodied M. Sazonofs two points demobilisation or co-operation               with the Allies.Athens, No. 915.       68.  Some additional light on  the immediate necessities  of  the^eTsfMO-lOAM  case was a^or(^e^ ky an appreciation which now. came in from  ourbep .   ,     A.M.  m-^ary attaehe at Athens, in which Sir  E. Elliot concurred.   It               was believed on  good authority that  the Germans, for military               reasons,  had postponed  their attack  on Serbia until the 12th or               13th October, and consequently the situation  was favourable for               Serbia to attack Bulgaria forthwith.  The general view of the Greek               array was that an end must be put to the Bulgarian menace that               had hung over them so long,, and they believed that if a  joint plan               of operations could be agreed upon between the Greeks and Serbians,               the King would not stand in the way of action, even before the allied               forces could be concentrated, but the immediate appearance of their               advanced troops was imperative.                                        dith Meeting.Minute,              69.  On  the 30th September the  Committee met again,  asSeptember 20.     arranged the previous day.  The questions considered were :-                   (1.) Whether the ultimatum suggested by Bussia, calling on                         Bulgaria to demobilise within forty-eight hours  should                         be approved.                   (2.) What communication should be made to Greece  in  regard                         to the proposed  landing of allied troops at Salonica.                   (3.) What further. steps  should  be taken in  regard to the                         troops themselves.                   (1.) Bulgaria.-The main factors  of  the problem were  that               Bulgaria had not yet declared for the Central Powers, and that there               wras a likelihood of.her not doing  so in face of the great success               of the Allies in the West;  but that so far it did seem assured that               the offensive in Erance would develop into  a success great enough               to turn the scale.                   There  was  also the  consideration  that as  Bulgaria  had               proclaimed  an armed neutralityit was scarcely  fair, in view  of               the  analogous attitude of Holland and Switzerland, to call on her               to demobilise, although it  had to be recognised that the presence               of German and Austrian officers tended rather to approximate her               attitude to that of Turkey at the outbreak of the war.                   Einally, there  was the difficulty that it was unfair to Serbia               to give Bulgaria further time  to define her course  of action.   It               Avas understood that Serbia was anxious to take advantage  of her               readiness to attack before the Bulgarian mobilisation was  complete,               and that if she struck at once she could probably march straight to               Sofia.                   This consideration strongly indicated a peremptory ultimatum,               wdiich would set Serbia&apos;s  hands  free to  attack  if it  was not               complied Avith.  But this again  might permit  Greece to contend               that no casus foederis had  arisen under her defensive treaty with               Serbia, a position she was the more likely  to take up as  her own               army would not be concentrated  and  the Allied contingents Avould               not be readv to act from Salonica.                        ... v                   The  general  view, therefore, Avas that  no peremptory ulti-               matum could be sent until  we were more certain of  the attitude  of
 Greece, but that the Bulgarian Government must be given clearly to understand the  dangers to which her present attitude exposed her.     After  full discussion, the following draft,  suggested by  Mr. Balfour, was adopted as a basis of a joint communication to be made at Sofia.   It was to be sent to Paris, Petrograd, and Rome, with an intimation that it  was our final  conclusion  as to  the  steps which should be taken.     &quot; Bulgarian mobilisation, in absence of any reply to last note of the four Powers, cannot be regarded except as  a threat to Serbia  concerted with Austria and Germany, especially as we are informed it is accompanied by arrival of German officers at Sofia.  We  cannot, in such circumstances, restrain Serbia from action to defend her existence.     &quot;If hostilities break out in Balkan Peninsula due to the mobilisation of Bulgaria, which cannot in present circumstances be regarded as other than provocative, the four Powers will be obliged to break off relations  with Bulgaria and give support to their friends.&quot;     (2.) Greece. It was  obvious  that  the effect  of  this communi- cation  in  Bulgaria  would  mainly  depend  on  the simultaneoas appearance of the Allied troops at Salonica.     No reply had  been received  from Greece  to the last telegram asking for her  equivocal  attitude to be  cleared up,  and difficulty was felt in landing  the  troops unless we had assurance  that no protest would be made.  A communication in the nature of an ulti- matum was suggested, but it Avas considered  to be unwise at this stage to press either the King or  M. Venizelos too hard.   It was agreed, therefore,  to push  on the  landing  preparations  on  the strength of the original Greek invitation.     As there  was no  time  to  concert measures  with  France, and  she had  already given  orders  for troops to  go from the Dardanelles, she was to be informed of our intention, but Sir Ian Hamilton was to be careful to arrange that the French and British troops arrived together.   Italy was also to be informed, but no  wait was to be made for her concurrence.     (3.) Force Available. A  telegram  had been  received  from Sir  Ian  Hamilton saying that  General  Bailloud  had  received orders  from home to embark one division to be  organised entirely of European troops. In these circumstances Sirlanprotestedhecouldnot spare the 53rd  Division, and proposed to retain it.  The 10th Division was to begin embarking for Mudros  that night, the embarkation to be completed the following night.  He had ordered General Bailloud to send one brigade to Mudros with the first British contingent.     On this basis it was agreed the landing  at Salonica should go forward, subject  only to  the  proviso that the  French and British troops should land  together.   The Admiralty  considered that the 140 miles between Mudros and Salonica  could  be covered  at night without serious risk.     70. In instructing Mr. 0&apos;Beirne  to proceed on Mr. Balfour&apos;s porejgn 0ffice t0 formula he was told  to point out how  the  presence of  German Sofia, No. 486, officers  at Constantinople had led to an  unprovoked attack on Sept. 30. Russia, and to suggest that the dismissal of  those  at Sofia might provide  a  means  of  easing  the  situation  short  of   actual demobilisation.    Our Ambassadors at Paris, Petrograd, and Rome were instructed to say  that the  draft expressed the  conclusions  of the  British Government after long and anxious consideration.    71. During the day M. Venizelos  assured our Minister that Athens, No. 924,the troops would be welcome, but that it  was hopeless to think of Sept. 30.inducing the King  to forgo a protest.   He had, however, agreed Received 8-45 P-M-to co-operate with the Allies so far as regarded naval  protection of the anchorage.
Athens, No. 922,Sept. 30.Vice-Admiral, EastMediterranean, inNo. 234, Oct. 3.Received12-45 P.M.     72. Later  on Sir E.  Elliot  telegraphed that  Sir  E.  G-rey&apos;sdeclarations in  Parliament  on the 28th September  had produced avery  bad  impression at  Athens.  [It  would  appear   that  thetelegraphic  summary, probably owing to German machinations,had  done full justice to his reference  to  our  traditional  sympathywith the Bulgarian people, but had  slurred  over  or omitted hisemphatic declaration of our intention, if Bulgaria became aggressive,to give to our friends  in the Balkans &quot; all the support in  our powerin the manner that would be most welcome to them  in concert withour Allies without reserve and without qualification.&quot;]  Sir F. Elliotadded that the  incident was being used by the Opposition press tocreate  an  impression that the offers  to  Bulgaria  at Greece&apos;sexpense were still open.  He urged that the matter should be putright forthwith.   Possibly  Mr.  0&apos;Beirne&apos;s  suggestion  to  KingFerdinand&apos;s Secretary of the 29th  September was communicated atthis  time.   In  any case the attitude of  M. Yenizelos  suddenlybecame antagonistic.     73. On the 29th September Brigadier-General  Hamilton,  withsome British naval and  military officers  and two Erench militaryofficers were sent  in  a destroyer to  Salonica, and  the &quot; LatoucheTreville,&quot; and subsequently H.M.S. &quot; Doris&quot;  followed to maintainwireless touch with the Admiral.   On the 30th Admiral de Bobeckwas able to report all  ready for netting and securing the  anchorageand for transporting the troops.OCTOBER 1.War OfficeSummary.Admiralty out,No. 234, Oct. 3.Sofia, No, 487,Oct 1.Athens, No. 933.    74. In the afternoon of the 1st October the &quot;Latouche Treville&quot;reported a complete entente with the Greek authorities  at Salonica,and the net-ships were sent forward, so that the nets would be inposition early on the  2nd.   The  10th  Division, which  had beenwithdrawn from  Suvla Bay  to Mudros,  was ordered to embark.The  Erench  division,  under  direct orders  from Paris, had beenwiciidrawn from Cape Helles without Sir Ian  Hamilton&apos;s con-currence,  and having  provided  itself with transport  had  alreadystarted for Salonica.   Sir Ian had therefore  to replace it with  the53rd  Division, and  it  was  doubtful  whether  any part  of thatdivision would be available for the expedition.  In  Egypt GeneralMaxwell  was preparing a  mounted brigade,  but  had  only  oneregiment actually ready.    75. During the night of the lst-2nd October it  was knownthe French troops were returning to Mudros. Owing apparently tothe offence which M. Venizelos had taken at the version of Sir E. Grey&apos;sdeclaration that had reached  him the French  troops were refusedadmittance.  Admiral de Bobeck therefore stopped the  departure ofour 10th  Division,  but did  not at once  recall the ships  fromSalonica.    76. On the 1st October an attempt was made to  remove  themisunderstanding by a communication to  the  press,  the  gist ofwhich was that the Allies regarded the  arrival of German  andAustrian officers  at  Sofia with the utmost  gravity, and that theyfelt bound to support the States which such  conduct threatened.    77. The  real cause of M. Venizelos&apos;s antagonism soon  becameapparent.   Sir F. Elliot and the Erench Minister had an interviewwdth him, at  which  he stated  no  troops could land at  Salonica  tillhe had formal assurance that, once in Macedonia, they would  notbe used to extort concessions  to Bulgaria at the expense of Greeceand Serbia.    He had  heard  that  General  Hamilton (whom he believed to    [1099-1]                                           O
 he the Command er-in-Chief) had declared  he meant to take posses- sion of Salonica and had tried to bar the entrance to the port, and M. Venizelos was  indignant.  He had  asked the French  Minister to try to stop the French troops.  Sir F. Elliot urged him to  do so, and hoped the British troops would not start.  Everyone.at Athens, he said, shared M. Venizelos&apos;s suspicions, and he could not under- stand why (as  he believed)  the Commander-in-Chief  had gone to Salonica without informing  him.   (The previous arrangement was, of course, that only a few Staff officers should go.)     78.  This telegram was crossed by one from  Sir E. Gfrey urging Foreign Office to that a joint plan of operations should be settled in accordance with Athens, No. 821,,a suggestion of. our military attache in Athens.  It  was necessary 0ct-1-to know.at  once whether if Serbia attacked  Bulgaria the King  0^ gft^^0&apos; 925, Greece would support Serbia.                                      ep &apos;     79.  On  receiving  word of the misunderstanding at Salonica Foreign Office to,the Foreign Office telegraphed that the matter seemed to have been Athens, No. 825, grossly exaggerated.                                              Oct. 1.     All  that happened was that instructions  were  sent  on the;28th September to  General  Officer Commanding MediterraneanExpeditionary Force.to send three officers to Salonica to investigate,the conditions,  and prepare the scheme for the disembarkation of troops.   This appears from Athens telegram  No.  924  to   have been acquiesced in by  M. Venizelos.   It  was  to be hoped  that M. Venizelos would now be  able to issue necessary instructions for co-operation  by  the local authorities.     80.  Sir  F.  Bertie now  intimated that  France was  coming France, No. 709. round to  our  view,  and  would  probably accept  Mr. Balfour&apos;s formula as the basis of a communication to Sofia.  A  later telegram j?rance  ^0 710 stated that instructions in this sense had been sent to  Sofia.     Rome also agreed, but objected to  the  last words:   &quot; we Rome, No. 949. cannot in such circumstances restrain Serbia from action to defend her existence.&quot;   The contents of message, it was urged, would at once be known in the Balkans.  Serbia would regard it  as incitement to attack at once.   Greece would interpret, it as authorisation to do so, and situation in Greece was such that we could not afford to offer her a loophole  for escaping obligations.  The provocation should there- fore come from Bulgaria, not only by interpretation but by fact.     81.  Russia  on  the other hand was  still  in  favour of the Sofia, No 636 (a) ultimatum, though M. Malinof continued to urge that it should not be,delivered at  present.   He  still hoped the Allies would offer an immediate occupation of  the  uncontested zone,  and  this  view Mr.  0&apos;Beirne continued to support.     82. From Nish, however,  Sir C. des  Graz  reported emphati- Nish, No.4io, cally that the time for negotiating on the basis of such concession Oct. l. had   gone by.   With regard  to the  question of  a  Bulgarian occupation of  the  uncontested zone,  he repeated that the  time for  negotiations and  concessions was  considered  by the Serbian Government  to  be  passed; that in their opinion mobilisation was solely directed against Serbia; and that firm and immediate action at Sofia could alone save the situation.     Pressure brought  to bear by  the Allied  Powers to obtain consent to Bulgarian  occupation  in any form, or even to furtherconcessions,  would only  precipitate  the  conflict which  already appeared imminent.   A large part of the Serbian army was already on the frontier fully confident and being held back with, difficulty.     Even in the event of Bulgaria joining the Allies, the Serbianswould never, admit that, the Bulgarians should  hold or approachany part of their only line of communication to Salonica.
                   83.  Although, this  was  also  strongly  the  Russian  view,               Petrograd could  not  see the way to  giving  any assurance  of               co-operation in  the military demonstration  that was necessary to               make firm action effective.   France had been pressing her to do so,Petrograd,       but Sir F. Bertie telegraphed that although  M. Isvolsky had beenNo. 1439, Sept. 30.  urging France to send troops at once to Salonica, he had apparentlyOct1SiNO&apos;710&apos;    said nothing as to when Russian troops would be sent to Varna,               Bourgas, or the Danube for  the  purpose  of  intimidating  KingPetrograd,       Ferdinand.  Eventually,  however,  Petrograd accepted the BritishNo. 1443, Oct. 1.   formuiaj but with the same reservation the Italians had made.Foreign Office toAthens. No. 826.                   84.  At the same time further efforts were being made to clear               the  trouble  at Athens.   Sir E.  Elliot was  requested to inform               M. Venizelos that there was never any intention to ask the Greek               Government to allow the passage of  British troops for the  purpose               of extorting concessions from Greece, and to add that His Majesty&apos;s               Government considered their offer to  Bulgaria as having lapsed by               Bulgaria&apos;s own action, and were so informing their Allies.  It was               not, however, politic that their view should be known at this moment               at Sofia,  where  it would unite the Bulgarians under King Ferdinand ;               or at Nish, since it was hoped,.should war break out between Serbia               and  Bulgaria, that  Greece and Serbia would come to an immediate               arrangement for concerted action against Bulgaria.Foreign Office to       85.

At Sofia, in spite of the  general agreement on the Britishformula, the  four  Ministers  were  unable to  settle a  form ofcommunication,  since  the Russian envov  had categorical instruc-tions  that, whatever  its  form,  it  must  include  a  demand  forco-operation with the Allies or demobilisation.   Ivlr. 0&apos;Beirne, how-ever,  stated   that   Bulgaria&apos;s  military preparations   were  nowso far advanced that Serbia herself would probably not  desire toattack her in  present  circumstances  (from which it  appeared hethought there  was still time for further  discussion).    87. To this the Foreign Office replied in answento his No. 636that it  was too late to  force  Serbia to allow  an  occupation  byBulgaria of even a part of the uncontested zone once Bulgaria hadmobilised.  The  guarantee to Bulgaria wras conditional on  herattacking Turkey at  once, whereas she.had.come to an agreementwith  Turkey,  had mobilised  her army, and was  concentrating itagainst Serbia.    88. At Athens  the  situation  was  equally  difficult.   Ourmilitary attache stated that the General Staff were opposed to alanding at Salonica  before they themselves were ready, for fear ofpremature rupture by Bulgaria and action  by German  submarines.They  would prefer us to wait and come up on the right of their line;but to this disposition M. Venizelos objected, as it might mean goingto Cavalla, and this, he thought, wrould raise suspicions that we were
going to bold it for Bulgaria.   He seemed to prefer our going inthe centre;  for  he feared suspicion would persist even after  anassurance of our honourable intention.    So   strained  was  the  situation   that  Sir F.  Elliot,   on Athens, No. 941,hearing  from  our  consul-general at  Salonica  that  &quot; General 0ct LHamilton aud several officers arrived with  no orders,&quot; telegraphedthat he was  sending  message  to General  Hamilton explainingsituation and advising him to leave Salonica as soon as  possible.    89. The  actual  military  position   our   military   attache Athens, No. 937explained as follows : -                                           0ct&quot;1&apos;    Disposition of Bulgarian forces according to the Greek GeneralStaff :-    Third Division on Black Sea coast, afterwards  to  form reserveto 10th Division to oppose landing by Allies near Dedeagatch.    First and Second Armies (6 divisions) to oppose Serbia.   ThirdArmy (3 divisions) against Greece.    Greeks reckon 275,000 Bulgarian rifles, and themselves disposeof 175,000.    There was  hope, however, that a  conflict  might be deferred Sofia. No. 641,for some time, for our military attache reported  :                  0ct L    &quot;  The Minister  of  War, on being asked if Bulgaria would withdraw3 kilom. provided Serbia agreed to  do likewise, accepted the proposal withalacrity subject to Prime Minister^ approval.    &quot;It is certain that Bulgaria does not wish to provoke a war at present,but Russian Minister is convinced that a convention with Germany has beensigned and there are many indications that such is the  case.    &quot; Artillery of 1st Division leaves Sofia to-day.&quot;    90.  At Athens Sir F. Elliot was still  trying to clear  the way. Athens, No. 935,He reported having informed M. Venizelos that  he presumed,  when Oct. 1.situation  had  been  cleared  up by a  declaration  of the  AlliedGovernments&apos; intentions, there would be no more question of protestagainst our landing  of troops.   He replied that protest must stillbe made since it was  essential for Greece to maintain  neutrality soas not to expose the 250,000 men who would be  sent to Salonicaby sea to danger  from German submarines.  [He thus  raised  anentirely new point, but it is doubtful if he really  believed respectfor Greek waters  would prevent  German  submarines  attackingAllied transports.]    Sir  F.  Elliot  without  comment  only observed  that it wasout of  the question to  send troops to Salonica at this  moment.When the time again came for it the manner in  which the  intentionto send them should  be announced to the Greek  Government wouldrequire careful consideration.    91.  The Greek War  Office on their part were pressing  againfor a  joint plan of operation  to be settled  before further steps weretaken.  Our military attache reported :                           Athens, No. 9361    &quot;  General Staff to-day remarked on danger involved  in absence of any Oct. 1-joint plan of action: having no  knowledge  of what we wished to do, theirown plans with Serbs were difficult to fix.    &quot;  Staff officer said  that King was  quite prepared for war but  mighthesitate  if asked at  the last moment to commit his army  to a situationcompromised by unco-ordinated action.&quot;    92.  The intentions of Greece  were still so doubtful that for Foreign Office tofurther light Sir Edward Grey requested Sir F. Elliott to ascertain, Athens, No. 831,if possible, the terms of the Serbo-Greek  Treaty, showing how far 0ct&apos; 2&apos;Greece  was bound to  support Serbia  should the  latter  take  theinitiative in declaring war on Bulgaria.    93. Affairs had reached this point when in the  course  of theafternoon the following information from Petrograd arrived whichentirely changed the outlook.
Petrograd,No. 1448, Oct. 2.      The Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed the British and  French  Ambassadors that he had instructed Russian Minister at  Sofia to  concert with  his colleagues in making a communication to  the  Bulgarian  Government   in  accordance with  Foreign Office  telegram No. 486 to Sofia.   In view,  however, of alarming news  just received respecting the situation in Bulgaria and of the rapidly  approaching  completion  of  the  concentration  on  the  Serbian  frontier  he had  decided to  supplement  it  by  requesting  the  Bulgarian Minister to telegraph to his  Government  that afternoon  that, unless they  assured  him within twenty-four hours of  the&apos; receipt  of his telegram to  deport German officers at present at Sofia, the Russian  Government  would break off negotiations and recall their legation.      On  being pressed  to defer  this step for a  day  or two  so that the four  Powers might act in  concert he said that it was impossible to do so.  He had  been  attacked in yesterday&apos;s Council of Ministers for not having taken  some such  step, and had been reproached for allowing Russia to  abdicate  her  rdle  of the great Slav Power  of Europe;  the same was being said in the press, and the Government could not add to its internal difficulties by braving public opinion on this question.  Russia was in an entirely different position from the other Powers, and could not run the risk of being shown the door by the Bulgarian Government, who  were absolutely committed to Germany, and were receiving large consignments  of gold from her.   It was useless to  try  to  detach her, and  he only regretted that out  of consideration for  Sir Edward Grey&apos;s  views he had not taken a stronger line  sooner.  He promised  to  send  in the course of a day the test of the telegram which he was addressing to the Russiam Minister at Sofia.Petrograd,No. 1451, Oct. 2.Received Oct. 3,1*45 A.M.     94.  The text was as follows :     &quot;Events which are taking place at the moment in Bulgaria bear witnessto the definite resolve of the Government of the King of the Bulgarians toplace the fate of the country in the hands  of Germany.  The presence ofGerman and Austrian officers at the Ministry of War and on the staffs of thearmy concentrated in  the Serbian frontier zone,  and the  considerablefinancial  assistance accepted by  the Sofia  Cabinet from our enemies, nolonger leave any doubt as to the object of the present military preparationsof the Bulgarian Government.  The Entente Powers  who have had therealisation of  the Bulgarian people&apos;s aspirations at heart, have repeatedlywarned the Bulgarian Prime.Minister that any act hostile to  Serbia wouldbe considered as directed against themselves.  Assurances lavished by theChief of the Bulgarian Cabinet in answer  to these warnings are contradictedby the facts.  Representative  of Russian country, united to  Bulgaria byimperishable memory of latter&apos;s liberation from Turkish yoke, cannot sanctionby his presence preparations for fratricidal aggression against an allied Slavpeople.   Russian Minister has therefore received instructions  to  leaveBulgaria with the whole staff of the legation  and of the consulates if, withintwenty-four hours, the Bulgarian Government does not openly break withthe enemies of the Slav  cause and of Russia, and does not proceed to theimmediate removal  of the officers of the States at War with the EntentePowers.&quot;     (The above communication was  issued to the press.)     95.  Earlier in the  day Sir R.  Rodd  had  telegraphed  thatsuch an ultimatum had been  proposed to Rome, and that thoughthe Foreign  Minister considered it  inopportune he  was preparedto agree if the  other  three  Powers did not oppose it, insisting thatthe time had  come for action in order to force the hand of the Kinc*of Greece about Salonica,Foreign Office toRome, No. 1748,Oct. 2.     96.  This  demarche of  Russia frankly  overrode the  Britishformula.  Further discussion upon it was useless, and the ForeignOffice telegraphed to Rome that, in view of Russian Minister forForeign Affairs&apos; communication to Bulgarian Minister at Petrograd,the wording of proposed communication by Allied representatives     [1099-1]                           &apos;                 D
at Sofia was of minor importance, since no doubt the Allies wouldassociate themselves with the action of the  Russian Government.     Mr. 0&apos;Beirne had  therefore  been  instructed, provided com-munication had not already been made, to accept whatever formof wording his colleagues agreed to.     97. The  important point now  was  to  get the  troops  toSalonica  as  soon  as  possible, and  in  order to  fall  in witn  thesuggestions of the Greek general staff.   Accordingly Sir Jb\ Elliot Foreign Office towas directed  to  inform tiie  military  attache  that  a  conference Athens, No. 830,between  the Erench and  English  general  staffs would shortly  ct-&quot;-assemble  in  London to discuss the question of the  concentration atSalonica and the role of the  combined forces.  He was requested toobtain, if possible, a copy of the plan drawn up by the Greek generalstaff.     98. In order to remove the remaining suspicions  of  Greece, Foreign Office tothe Eoreign  Office decided to suggest a further inducement, and Paris, No. 2213;the  following  telegram was sent to the British Ambassadors  at p^grad&apos;, No!1&apos;Paris,  Rome, and Petrograd  :                                     2286; Oct. 2.    &quot; Our information from Athens shows that Greek  opinion, even that ofM. Venizelos,  remains suspicious  that any  Allied  troops passed throughSalonica will be  subsequently  used to force Greece  and Serbia  to makeconcessions to Bulgaria.    &quot; You should accordingly ascertain whether Government to which youare accredited would agree to the Allied representatives at Athens being .instructed, if war breaks out between Serbia and  Bulgaria, to inform  M.Venizelos that Allied Powers, besides giving Greece and Serbia military aidalready promised, guaranteed to Greece  her  present territories, and, if it isin their power at the conclusion  of the war, will assign  to her Smyrna andthe hinterland, provided  that  she assists Serbia and  the Allies  againstBulgaria with all her force.&quot;     99. At  the same  time a strong  appeal was  made  to  M. Foreign Office toYenizelos,  pointing out the  danger of further hesitation.   Sir Athens, No. 832,Erancis Elliot  was directed to inform  him  that it was at the Oct. 2.latter&apos;s request that all our military arrangements had been alteredin order to send troops to Salonica.   The troops  must land  or notaccording to the military plans of the Allies and Greece, and notaccording to  their political plans.     The Greek Government had our assurance  that we-regardedour offer to Bulgaria as  having lapsed, and we were ready to repeatthat assurance in any binding way he pleased.     Unless the Allied troops  landed in the immediate  future  atSalonica, or unless it was made clear that the Allied  Governmentswere working in complete harmony  with Greece, King Eerdinandwould  be upheld in his  conviction that  Greece would leave him afree hand.     100.  While this telegram was on its  wav, there were indicationsthat the air at Athens was clearing, and  that  M. Venizelos wasinclined to accept our proposal for naval co-operation.     Sir E. Elliot sent home  a semi-official  proposal,  which  had Athens, No. 943,been made to  him by M. Venizelos,  as  to the co-operation of the Oct. 2.Allied fleets  in protecting the Greek transports from Piraeus andVolo to Salonica.  The Greek  patrols would have orders  to fire onany submarine sighted  inside Euboea, but the Government wishedthe official suggestion of the scheme to come from our side.     101.  Sir  E. Elliot also  explained that the  misunderstanding Athens, No. 944,about  the Staff officers at Salonica had been partly cleared up.  He 0ct*2-stated that he had learnt for  the first  time  that morning (2nd ?^P^chedOctober)  that  it  was  not the Oommander-in-Chief  who  was  at received 9-50 F.M.Salonica, and had telegraphed to the consul as  follows : 
Athens, No. 946,Oct. 2.Foreign Office toAthens, No. 834,Oct. 2.Athens, No. 947,Oct. 2.Admiralty toMalta, No. 569,Oct. 3.Athens, No. 951,Oct. 2.                          OCTOBER  3.     102.  Shortly after midnight another  telegram  was receivedfrom Sir  F. Elliot to say that the reassuring telegrams from theForeign Office (Nos. 819-821 and 825) had  produced a good  effect.M. Venizelos was in  a most nervous and excitable  condition, andhad  even  become more intractable on hearing that the French hadarrived at  Salonica.    Before  consenting to their disembarkationwithout more than a  protest, he required from the French Ministera statement giving the reason for their coming, and  a  declarationto the following effect:     &quot; On  occasion of passage of Allied  troops  through Saloniea, FrenchGovernment declare they have no intention of encroaching on the sovereignrights of Greece, or of interfering in the administration of the country.&quot;     M. Venizelos said that  wherever we went we acted as  if theplace belonged to us, and he  must safeguard himself against thisbeing done at Salonica.     He  eventually agreed to send  instructions  that  the  troopswere to be allowed to land under protest next day, by which timehe was assured that instructions would have been received from theFrench Government authorising the required declaration.   He laidstress  on the necessity of the troops doing  no  more  than  passthrough Salonica and Greek territory.     The  suspicion of us, which  had  now become ingrained inall classes of the population, had actually laid hold of M. Venizeloshimself.     Sir     Elliot stated   that he would be required  to  make asimilar declaration, and requested authority to do so, and authoritywas sent him in the course of the day.     103.  Meanwhile things had been made worse  by the action ofthe British fleet in taking precautions against enemy submarines.     M. Venizelos received a telegram  that morning to the effectthat  the  British were placing  wire netting at  the entrance tothe  port  of Adamas, in  the  Greek  island of  Milo; entrance wasprohibited by night and only allowed by day under supervision.     The  fact was that the French Commander-in-Chief was usingMilo Island as  a centre  for his anti-submarine  patrols, and hadarranged  with  Admiral  de Robeck to assist  with net  defence.Admiral  de Robeck  considered  such a  base  absolutely necessary,not  only  at Adamas, but also  at  Oerigotto, between  Crete andCerigo, as the enemy were undoubtedly using the less-frequentedislands as submarine  bases.     M. Venizelos protested vehemently against this  infringementof Greek sovereign rights in an  island  within  the earliest  limitsof the Greek Kingdom.     104.  Nevertheless, a  plain assurance  from the French, addedto our own, that the  Allied offers  to  Bulgaria had definitely lapsed,at last threw open the port of Salonica.     Sir   F. Elliot  stated  that  his   French  colleague had  that evening informed M. Venizelos  in  his presence  that the FrenchGovernment regarded the offers to Bulgaria as having lapsed, andwere ready to join Serbia and Greece in maintaining the Treaty ofBucarest.  M. Venizelos  was greatly pleased, and asked that ourtroops should be sent to  Salonica and  landed as soon as possible. He  read  the  protest  which  he was  addressing to the FrenchMinister  against the violation of   Greek   neutrality involved in    &quot;Inform Brigadier-General  Hamilton that,  owing  to  inexplicableomission of Headquarters to notify me of his being sent, he has naturallybeen taken for the Commander-in-Chief,   Ask him to remain until furthernotice, but to take no action except  in friendly consultation with the Greekauthorities.&quot;
demanding the passage of troops before a casus foederis with Serbiahad arisen, but at the same time  he stated  that  orders had  beengiven at Salonica not only not to oppose the landing, but to  offerevery facility, the west  side of the harbour to  be  set aside for theAllied troops.  No further protest would be addressed to the BritishMinister than that addressed to his Erench colleague.    105. Sir F. Elliot was now able  to inform General Hamilton Athens, No. 952,that satisfactory arrangements  had been made for disembarkation Oct. 2*of the Allied troops, and the  west  (i,e., the  Serbian)  side of theharbour having been set aside for the purpose.    General  Hamilton  was  to  deal entirely  with  the GreekMinister of Communications, who  would arrive at Salonica on the3rd October.    106. Notwithstanding the days that had been lost there seemedto be still time for effective action.  Mr. 0&apos;Beirne was  given to Sofia, No. 644,understand that  Bulgaria would  take  no military action for a Oct. 2.fortnight, by which time the Bulgarian Government anticipated thatan Austro-German force would have invaded Serbia.  He  had it onthe same  authority that when the Austro-German  advance becamean accomplished fact Bulgarian troops would enter Macedonia underthe pretext that Serbia was crushed and Macedonia was res nullius.This was the view of the Prime Minister, but was not shared by theMinister of Einance, who  favoured immediate action against Serbiawhen Bulgaria&apos;s military preparations were complete.    107. In a second telegram he gave  some particulars  obtained Sofia, No. 645,from  the  military attache to the legation as to  the presence of Oct. 2-German and  Austrian  officers in Bulgaria.   The  actual  military Athens, No. 945,situation,  according to   the Greek  general   staff, was  that the Oct. 2.Bulgarian  covering forces against the Serbian, front consisted oftwo divisions  (5th  and   6th), and  five  regiments of  a  thirddivision (7th), with the  necessary artillery and  cavalry, and againstthe Greek front  were  one regiment  (7th Division) at Kostorino,south of Djumaia.    Our  military attache  also stated that the  grouping of the Athens, No. 949,Greek army  corps and divisions  wras completed  to-day,  and the Oct. 2.transport to Macedonia would commence the following day.    108.  From our military attache ait  Berne it Avas learned that Berne, No. 670,considerable forces of Austrians and Germans had been directed to Oct. 3.the Danubian front.  These were partly fresh troops, partly fromGalicia, and from the central groups  of  Brest-Litovsk, the generaldirection of this movement being by the line of Budapest, Maria-theresiopol, Arad, Grosswardein, and Temesvar.    109.  The only difficulty that now remained Avas M. Venizelos&apos;s Foreign Office tocondition that we should not stop  at Salonica, but at once pass the Q^egS&apos; No&apos; 835&apos;troops through to Serbian territory.   Sir E.  Grey  therefore repre-sented that the Greek Government must recognise the necessity ofallowing us, Avith or Avithout  protest, to  concentrate troops  in ornear Salonica, arid not merely pass them through  as they arrived.We must  prepare a base, and could not undertake  to pass smallcontingents up the line  into Macedonia at once, which might wellbe military madness.     Sir F. Elliot was therefore informed that he must be respon-sible that there should  be no further  political obstacles throAvn inthe Avay of what was a very difficult military concentration, whichmust extend over a long deriod.D    110. The question  of  the Russian ultimatum had still to be Foreign Office todealt with, and  Sir E.  Grey  telegraphed to Paris, Petrograd, and pafis&apos;No-2221&apos;Rome  that he would be glad to know what  line the  respective 22890gand Rome                                                                No. 1758; Oct. 3&apos;.

Before this could reach Home two telegrams from Sir It.Rodd explained the Italian attitude, both  to the  ultimatum  and toSir E.  Grey&apos;s suggestion for offering Smyrna to Greece.     The Minister for  Foreign Affairs stated that he had  alwaysgiven the Italian Minister at Sofia instructious to concert with hiscolleagues  as to the  terms of the communication, but he presumedthat it had now been made,  and the Russian supplementary com-munication should leave no doubt as to  the views of the Powers.The Russian position was exceptional, and it was appropriate sheshould take the lead and that the rest should follow.     The Minister also considered that Sir E. Grey&apos;s proposal asregards cession  of territory to Greece  after the war went bevondwhat M. Venizelos asked for.   In his opinion  we  should  not tieour  hands  again with  promises affecting  the future.  He citedRoumania  as a warning.  He believed  that a  formal  assurancethat our proposals  to Bulgaria had  not entirely lapsed and thatterritorial  questions were no  longer under consideration, in con-junction with the landing of  troops even with  a formal protest,would  suffice to. achieve the  end in view.   Should  it not, furthersteps might then be considered.Petrograd, No.1456, Oct. 3.Nish, No. 412-13,Oct. 2.Foreign Office toNish, No. 479,Oct. 3.Athens, No. 954,Oct. 3.Foreign Office toAthens, No. 837,Oct. 3.Athens, No. 955,Oct. 3.Paris, No. 719;Petrograd, No.1468; Oct. 4.     11&quot;2.  Russia, on being  informed of the British proposal, tooka more sympathetic view.   M. Sazonof had written to say that heshared Sir E. Grey&apos;s opinion that it  was necessary  to reassure theGreek Government as to the object of the despatch of Allied troopsto Macedonia, and had telegraphed the Russian Minister at Athensinstructing  him to associate himself  with Sir F.  Elliot in thedeclarations  which the latter  had  been instructed to  make toM. Venizelos in the sense of the telegram above mentioned.     113.  To Nish, where  an imperfect report  of  Sir  E.  Grey&apos;sspeech had also  caused  much heartburning, a reassuring telegramwas sent.   Sir  C. des Graz was  directed to inform the SerbianPrime Minister that there was no question of any Allied troops beingused  for  any other purpose  than  the protection  of Serbia.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government considered their offer to Bulgaria as havinglapsed by Bulgaria&apos;s own action, and  were informing the Allies tothat effect.     114.  It was a point on which  Greek feeling was still tender,and Sir F. Elliot stated that  M. Venizelos would like to  be able tosay in the Chamber on the 4th October that the offers to Bulgariahad lapsed.  Failing this,  he would like to  be supplied with aformula which  would  satisfy Greek  public opinion without doingharm elsewhere.     In reply Sir  E.  Grey  said  it would be  necessary  to answerM. Venizelos without. having had time to consult the other Allies,but  as far  as  we were  concerned  he  agreed  to  the  followingformula:     &quot; The  Bulgarian Government,  having mobilised their army under thesuperintendence of German officers,  must be  taken to have  rejected theproposals made to them by the Allies, to which no answer has been returned,and these proposals have, in consequence lapsed.&quot;    The  above  telegram was repeated  to  Paris, Petrograd, andRome for the information  of the respective Ministers  for ForeignAffairs, but  in  the meantime Sir F. Elliot telegraphed  that  theItalian  Minister had received  instructions  that his Governmentconsidered the promises to  Bulgaria  as having lapsed and had soinformed  M. Venizelos.   France  and Russia  concurred in  theformula next day.    [1099-lj                                            E
    115, Next morning arrived  a statement from Mr. 0&apos;Beirne Sofia, No. 646,setting  out his view  of  the  situation created by  the Russian 0ct&apos;3&quot;ultimatum.  He explained that he had made no  communication.on the basis of Mr. Balfoui^s formula  to the  Minister for ForeignAffairs, and in view of the nature of the Russian demands onBulgaria, which he assumed would he  rejected,  it was absurd nowto ,make the proposed communication.    It  was rather unfortunate that one of the grounds for  theRussian ultimatum should be &quot; presence of German  and Austrianofficers  at  the Ministry of War, and  on the staffs of the army.&quot;Mr. 0&apos;Beirne stated that, so far as he knew, there were no Germanor Austrian officers of  superior rank in Sofia except the Germanmilitary attache, who is a  general, and that there  were  as yet nosuch officers on the staffs of the army.   As regards  the Ministry ofWar,  all that could be  said was that German and Austrian militaryattaches had been  in constant attendance, and might be presumedto have been  collaborating with the  Bulgarian  authorities with aview to concerted military action.    In a  second  telegram  he stated  that, so  far as  he  knew, Sofia, No. 647,there  were  as yet no German or Austrian officers in Sofia  of ^ct- 8*sufficiently high rank  to direct the  Bulgarian armies or divisionsin case of war except the German military attache.    M. Sazonof, however, insisted that his  information  respecting Petrograd, No.the presence of German officers was quite different, and that in any 1457&apos; ^ct- 4-case all  Bulgarian military  matters  were in the hands of  themilitary  attache,  General  Massau,  who  w-as   an  officer of  theGerman Staff.                       OCTOBER 4 AND 5.    116. At Mudros no movement had been made.   Both French Admiralty out,and British transports Avere now there ready to start, but in reply to ^-S^AM^&apos;a telegram from Admiral de Robeck the Admiralty instruction Avas,&quot; Unless Allies  have been invited by the Greek Government do *not  move till  further orders.  Will  wire again about  middayMonday  (the  4th),  that  is,  after  the  Dardanelles  Committeehave met.&quot;    117. Before the meeting the Admiral announced that M. Veni- Admiralty iu,zelos  now wished the troops to  go  to Salonica, and asked if the No-  2ii-transports should proceed.    The Admiralty  then instructed  him to send  the net-laying Admiralty out,vessels at once, and the transports as soon as the anchorage  Avas Na4:00-reasonably secure.    In confirmation  of  the  Admiral&apos;s  action  Sir F.  Elliot Athens, No. 957,reported that  he had  read  Foreign Office  telegram  No.  832 to 0ct 3-M.  Venizelos,  and after some discussion had  succeeded in per-suading him that what  v/as suggested was  merely an indispensablemeasure  of   military   preparation  for  a possible  eventuality.M. Venizelos thought the proposal would be best presented to theKing by the Chief of the General Staff.                          Both Meeting.    118. Lord Kitchener urged the necessity  of  a conference,  Minutes, Oct. 4.Ministerial and Staff, with the  French to consider the strength androle of  the  troops in the Balkans;  particularly it was doubtfulAvhether  General Joffre  kneAv  of   the  promise  of the  FrenchGovernment to send an Allied force of 150,000 men.    It  was  represented  that we  could come to no decision tillwe knew what the French Avere going to do, and  the extent of theireffort must depend on whether  they intended  to pursue General.Ioffre&apos;s -offensive policy in France.   At the same time, the dangerof Germany establishing communication with Turkey was so  great
               that preparations in view of possible  change in the  French policy               should be commenced at once.   A serious offensive in the Balkans               would require, in Lord Kitchener&apos;s opinion, from 200,000 to 400,000               men, and he had so informed the French General Staff.                   Sir  E.  Grey represented the difficulty of sending more troops               to  Salonica till we  knew what  Greece  meant  to   do.   It was               felt  generally  that  enough  troops had  been  sent  for  political               purposes, and  that if the Germans  made a strong  effort  to  get               through, they could do so before we could have  sufficient troops to               stop them ,a consideration which pointed to the desirability  of  not               &quot;furrjher weakening our force  at  the Dardanelles.  The question of               the Russian ultimatum and the  recall  of  our Minister from Sofia               was also discussed, as well as the advisability of communicating  our               Smyrna proposal to Greece at this juncture.                   The conclusions were :                    (1.) That  the S.000 Yeomanry now  on  the sea  should go  to                          reinforce Sir Ian Hamilton at  Gallipoli;                   (-2.) That Lord Kitchener should  proceed next day to  Calais to                          confer with the French General Staff ;Foreign Office to       &apos;&apos;(&amp;) That  Mr. 0&apos;Beirne  should  be  directed,  as  soon  as  hisSofia, No. 500,               French  and Italian colleagues received similar instruc-Oct. 4.                     tions,  to  join  them  in   associating His Majesty&apos;s                          Government  with  the declaration  of  the  Russian                          Government, and, if the  Russian  Minister left  Sofia,                          to  leave also as  soon  as  convenient alter makinc  his                          communication to the Bulgarian Government,  unless                          some unforeseen change  took place in the situation,                          which in his (Mr. 0&apos;Beirne&apos;s) opinion made it desirable                          to ask for fresh instructions;               .  .                   (4.) That  the telegram suggesting the assignment of Smyrna                          to Greece should not be sent to Athens.Foreign Office to       119. In forwarding to Petrograd  the conclusion about thePetrograd, No.    proposed Smyrna offer, Sir E. Grey stated that he had as yet sent no2298, Oct 4.      instructions  to  Sir I?. Elliot.   The present indications were that               M. Venizelos and the King  of  Greece realised the sincerity of our               intentions and  were  preparing  to  support  Serbia;  it  seemed               desirable, that  the  Allies should  avoid  saddling  themselves with               further  obligations  unless  and  until   they  become  absolutely               necessary.    He trusted therefore  that  the  Russian Minister at               Athens  would  make  no mention of the  suggestion at  present.               Presumably if  Greece actively  supported Serbia  against Bulgaria               the Allies  would guarantee Greek  territory  in  Europe, but this               question need not be raised till Greece asked for it, and Smyrna and               the hinterland  could only be given if Greece co-operated fully as               our ally against all  our enemies.Foreign Office to       120. With  regard  to the  alleged presence of foreign  officersOc?3^0&apos; 502&apos;     a^ ^0Ba&apos; we  accepted the Russian information,  and  Sir E. Grey               informed Mr. 0&apos;Beirne  that no doubt the &quot;Bulgarian Government               would officially deny appointments of German and Austrian  officers               to Ministry of War and Army  Staffs, but he understood that the               presence of  these officers in Bulgaria admitted of no doubt, and               only one inference was to be drawn from the fact.                   Although,  therefore, he  need  not   repeat the  statement  in               the Russian communication, which might be technically inaccurate,               yet  he  was  to make it clear  that we considered  the  Russian               statement as  virtually in accordance with the facts.Sofia, No. 651,         121. On these instructions Mr.  0&apos;Beirne acted  at once, and0ct-  4-           next  day  telegraphed   the  text  of  the  communication  which               lie  had  made  to  the Bulgarian  Prime Minister,  omitting any
if,                                                 v  &apos;                                      16        reference to the arrival of German officers at Sofia, as the Bulgarian        Government were likely to question it.  The text was as follows :            &quot; En 1&apos;absence de toute reponse a la demiere note des Puissances, alliees,        la mobilisation  bulgare ne peut etre  consideree que  comme une  menace        contre la Serbie, menace concertee avec lAutriche-Hongrie et TAllemagne^           &quot; Dans ces conditions, les  Puissances  ne peuvent  empeclier la Serbie        d&apos;entrer en action pour defendre son existence.           &quot; Si les hostilites  eclataient dans la peninsule balkanique en raison de        la mobilisation bulgare, qui ne  peut, dans les circonstances presentes  etre        regardee autrement  que  comrne une provocation,  le Gouvernement de        SaMajeste britannique serait oblige de rompre les relations avec la Bulgarie        et de soutenir les pays amis de la Grande-Bretagne.&quot;            122.  Next  day Mr. 0&apos;Beirne sent in an  account of  what  had SQfia* No- 652.        passed when he handed in the note.  He had explained at the same  ct&apos;  5&apos;        time  that he was expecting to receive instructions to  associate        himself  with  the  Russian  ultimatum which had  just been        delivered.           The  Prime  Minister  was  deeply  moved   by  the  Russian        ultimatum, which appeared  to have  come  to him  as a  complete        surprise.   He apparently cherished the belief that he  would be able        to carry out his plan of entering Macedonia, after the Germans  had        penetrated  into   Serbia, in a  quasi-peaceable   manner  without        provoking a rupture with the Allied Powers.           He gave his word of  honour that there  were  no German        officers  at  Sofia  except the military attache,  but  admitted  the        possibility that such officers were acting as  instructors  to  the        Bulgarian army, though  if such was  the case  it was  without his        knowledge.           Mr.  0&apos;Beirne  replied  that   the  question as to  German        officers was a  secondary one.   The  most important matter was the        conviction of  the Allies  that  Bulgaria had come to  an agreement        with the Central Powers Avith a view to  an attack on  Serbia,  and he        should like to have an assurance that  that Avas  not the case.  The        Prime Minister gave no  direct reply.  If the German forces were        in the interior of Serbia, Bulgarian troops would,  he said, enter        Macedonia, but he  did not  agree that this amounted to concerted        action by  Germany, and went on to complain Avith great  bitterness        of the way in Avhich Bulgaria had been treated by the Allied Powrers.        He had given the  Powers no  cause  for offence, and  had onty        mobilised Avhen Serbia,  after refusing  the Powers&apos; demands for  the        cession  of certain.Macedonian  territory, had  sent  troops  to  the        Bulgarian  frontier.  He also said  that he had given most positive        assurances as to his pacific  intention and they  were not believed.        A country such as  Bulgaria could not desire a conflict  Avith  the        Great  Powers, who  had not  acted Avell towards  her  in  &quot; sendins:        troops against her into the Balkans.&apos;           Mr.  0&apos;Beirne pointed   out  in conclusion  that  the rupture        could still be avoided if  Bulgaria gave  material proof that she did        not contemplate agression on Serbia in agreement with the Central        Powers, which she  could do  by withdrawing her troops from  the        Serbian frontier.           The  Prime Minister merely  replied that  he  must  answer        the Russian demands within  twenty-four hours.  He added that        he still hoped  Bulgaria would not be at war with Great Britain.  ^        In  a  later message, Mr.  0&apos;Beirne added  that  during  the Sofia, No. 655,        interview  the Bulgarian Prime Minister had informed him that the Oct. 5.        reply  of the Bulgarian  Government to the Entente Note  of the        14th September was UOAV ready, and  he  had  intended to hand it        to him.   But he  could  not  do so since the French  Minister  had        just previously informed him that  the offer  made by the Powers       had lapsed.           123. This action was not entirely in accord with Italian  views. Rome, No. 963,       A telegram from Sir R.  R,odd stated that he had just received a 0ct 4-
Sofia. No. 650,Oct. 4.Rome, No. 965.Oct. 5.note from the  Minister for Foreign  Affairs  to  say that he wouldhave preferred  that  the  communication proposed by  Sir F. Grey(Foreign Office Telegram No. 486 of the  30th  September) shouldhave been made by all the four. representatives  at  Sofia before theRussian ultimatum was communicated, since the latter only dealtwith  the  question of breaking  off diplomatic relations,  whereas,the  former included the  announcement of the intention of thePowers to  support  Serbia  if hostilities broke out in consequenceof the Bulgarian mobilisation.  He  saw no reason why the  threeother representatives should not still make  the communication inquestion with the consent of Russia  independently of  the Russianultimatum, and had instructed the Italian Minister to conform hisaction to that of his British and French colleagues.     Meanwhile Mr. 0&apos;Beirne  was telegraphing that in view of theimportance which Sir E. Grey attached to the  Bulgarian Governmenthems: informed that  we should not  consider Serbia  to be in thewrong if she attacked Bulgaria  he would make a communicationto the Bulgarian Government  in the  terms of Foreign Office tele-gram No. 486.  He added  that he should probably have  to  makeit alone since the Russian representatives had  decided merely todeclare his Governments  ultimatum.   The French Minister wassimilarly making  a  communication  demanding  the  removal ofGerman officers within twenty-four hours, while the Italian Ministerhad no instructions.    Next day, however, Sir R. Rodd was  able to  say  that theMinister for Foreign  Affairs had telegraphed  to the Italian Ministerat Sofia to act in conformitv with the  action of his British colleague.His view was that the best  course is to  go ahead without regard forthe sophistries of the Bulgarian Prime Minister.Athens, No. 961,Oct. 4.     124. In the meantime the misunderstanding about the landingat Salonica had been fully explained.   The acting  consul-general,Salonica, has reported that a General  with six officers arrived onthe  morning of the 30th September in a destroyer.  There wereno instructions awaiting him, and  he decided  to  telegraph  to theWar Office through the Admiral at Mudros by means of wireless,and  not to communicate  with the Greek authorities  until thesituation became clearer.     On the 1st and 2nd October the General and  his staff  madesuch indirect enquiries regarding the object of their visit as werepossible without getting into touch with the Greek authorities.     The General  Officer  Commanding the Salonica Army Corpshad  stated  that his orders were to resist the landing of troops, butin the evening informed the French consul-general that the disem-barkation would be allowed.     The General then felt himself justified in establishing touchwith the Greek military authorities, and on the 3rd  October calledon the General Officer Commanding at Salonica, and saw the Ministerof Communications in the evening. The  statements made in theofficial report to the Greek Government which had led to M. Veni-zelos&apos;s misunderstanding were absolute fabrications.     With  regard  to the  above statement of the  acting consul-general,  Sir  F. Elliot stated  that he  should  speak  strongly toM. Venizelos about the mendacious statements of the Greek GeneralOfficer Commanding.  The latter,  however, had now reported thathe was working harmoniously with the British officers.Foreign Office toAthens, No. 844,Oct. 5.    125. It only remained  to  settle  definitely for the  promisednaval co-operation of Greece.  To this end Sir E. Grey telegraphedthat the Admiralty considered it essential that the closest co-opera-tion should be established between  the  Greek and Allied navies iorthe protection of  the transports and a time-table  of  troop  move-ments drawn up on the spot at the earliest possible moment.  They    [1099-1]                                        .   F
pointed out that the Salonica expedition  added 150 miles  of  trans-port route to the routes which had hitherto required protection, andthe position  of Greece as regards destroyers and small  craft wasbetter in proportion to her requirements than ours.     As  an  additional  reason  for this  demand, Sir  B.   Greyadded that, as the Greek military plans remained the key to thesituation,  we  must   have  some  certainty  that Greece  wouldco-operate  in the war if we were  to spend our naval strength inprotecting  Greek troops.     With  regard to  how soon  and  how far these  larger ques-tions of co-ordination could be brought to  a head with the  GreekGovernment without  risking a breakdown  Sir F. Elliot must judgefor himself, doing  his best to reconcile the urgent demands of mili-tary safety step by step with the  still delicate  diplomatic situationwith which he had to deal. -         \    126. The military outlook  was  growing  graver every day. Sofia, No. 65S,Mr.  0&apos;Beirne stated  that the Bulgarian  fleet had entered Lake 0ct 5-Devna (Varna\    According to the Erench  military attache  there were nowabout eight Austro-German divisions  on the Serbian frontier, andat Temesvar a pontoon equipment of 250 boats and 350 guns.    Eour German instructors  in  aviation and two for  anti-aircraftguns were being employed in the Bulgarian army.            -    There  was  further  information  from a  reliable  source  at Sofia, No. 654,Sofia that there was no truth  in a report that 150 waggon-loads of Oct. 5.rifles  had  arrived  from  Roumania  for  the Bulgarian  army.Roumania had up  to the present been  behaving.very well  towardsthe Entente in this respect.    127. At Athens,  although  in the debate on foreign policy Athens, No. 970,M. Venizelos had carried a vote of  confidence in the Government Oct. 5.by 142 to 102, no progress could be made in  concerting a plan ofoperations.   The Chief of Staff had declined to make any statementto our military attache pending permission from his  Government.Meanwhile it might be assumed that the Greek array was concen-trating in the valley of the Lower Struma with one corps only northof Salonica.    The Greek  expectation  was  that  we  should pass   quicklyinto Serbia, and not remain in Greece.    128. Later Sir F.  Elliot reported that he had brought this refusal Athens, No. 972,to the notice of M. Venizelos.  His reply was that the King had decided 0ct- 5-to withhold any information until the moment arrived for action onthe part of Greece.   While agreeing that preliminary co-ordina-tion was essential, he said the King was still clinging to  the hopeof neutrality, and  had not even yet absolutely made up his mind tosupport Serbia if  attacked by.Bulgaria.   It was  to impress  HisMajesty on this point  that M. Venizelos had insisted so strongly inthe Chamber on Greece&apos;s obligations of honour and interests.  Headded that we had better make our plans without reference to theGreek army at all, but that we might consider our  right flank quitesecure, being covered  by the  Greeks in greater strength  than theBulgarians could bring against it.     M.  Venizelos was very anxious  that  we should  concentrateelsewhere than in the immediate  neighbourhood  of Salonica, andsuggested the Plain  of Karasulu.   He  hoped the troops wouldbring their own  supplies, and  &quot;not eat  up everything in  thecountry.&quot;  He hinted that the British officers  give offence by theircurt manner and want of tact, which led to difficulties with them,whereas there was  no  friction with the French.    129. In additional statement our military attache  reported Athens, No. 973,that  M.  Venizelos   still took  it for  granted that  the  Allied Oct. 5.&apos;
Bucharest,No. 634, Oct. 5.Bucharest,No. 653, Oct. 5.Athens, No. 974,Oct. 5.troops would proceed direct to assist the Serbians.  Should this heso the first consideration would, in  the opinion of the  militaryattache,  be the protection of the  Oriental  railway facing  theStrumnitza salient.   He  added that the  General Staff  thoughtthat Greece  would  eventually  fall into line,  and a good  effectwould  probably be caused if we could  give  a  general  assurancethat a large force would be soon forthcoming.     130. Two  farther   telegrams  from  Bucharest  gave  someadditional  light on  the military outlook.  Our military  attachestated  that he had learnt from a trustworthy source that  a  Germansubmarine  arrived at Varna on the 30th September, and that Varnaand  Bourg^s had been  mined under the supervision of  Germanofficers.  Sistova and the  Bulgarian bank of the Danube  aboveSistova had already been mined,  and  communication  betweenlloumania  and Bulgaria was suspended  except between  Rustchukand  by  the  main  road  connecting  Bazardjik  with  Varna.Mackensen&apos;s headquarters was said to be  at Werschetz.     131. With  regard  to  the general  attitude  of Roumania,Sir G. Barclay reported that the Prime Minister had informed himthat Roumania would not be wholly unprepared in the event  of  anultimatum.  She had her covering troops  ready, and much hadbeen done to strengthen  the defences of  her frontier.   He  believedthat if Roumania  mobilised it would  precipitate an attack on her.and even if it did not do so, a prolonged  state of  mobilisation  wouldbe very expensive and unpopular.     132. The situation had  reached this point when the  outlookwas  once more entirely changed by a quite unexpected development.     Late on the 5th Sir F. Elliot telegraphed that he had justreceived the following private note from M. Venizelos :     &quot; I regret to inform you that I have been obliged to hand in my resigna-tion to the King.&quot;(To be continued.)PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON. 22/10/1915.
