G.-23.COMMITTEE  OP IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.The Position  in  the Balkans.Note by the Secretary, prepared by the direction of the                   Prime Minister.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,         September 21, 1915.
    1. The Allies have now made their demarche at Sophia.    2. If their offer is accepted the next step will  be  for the  General Staffs of thePowers concerned to concert the.necessary military measures to give effect to it.    3. If, however, as seems far more probable, endeavours are  made  by Bulgaria  totemporise or negotiate, while using our offer to secure better terms from Turkey and ahigher price from the Central Powers, the offer will automatically lapse within a fewdays,  say a fortnight.   It appears necessary to consider what our policy is then to be,taking into account the fact that not only  can  we  no longer count on obtainingBulgarian assistance, but that we must consider her henceforth  as a potential enemywho is only waiting for a favourable opportunity to join actively against us.    4. We shall be faced with the possibility, and perhaps the probability,  that theCentral Powers will endeavour so far to overcome&apos;Serbian opposition  as  to  open upthe Danube in a military sense for the passage of munitions of war  of all  kinds  toBulgaria, and that,the latter State will permit these to pass to Turkey.    5. Clearly the first step to be taken is to reassure Serbia and Greece.  At presentSerbia is so upset at what is occurring that in a military sense  the nation  is paralysedand of little value to the cause  of the Allies; while  the sympathies of Greece areveering towards the Central Powers.  We should  therefore at once  tell both  thesecountries that the steps we had taken were intended in the best interests of the Alliesas a whole, but, as our offers had been rejected, they were at an end once and for all,and that a new chapter was opened in the policy of the Allies towards  the BalkanStates.    6. The next point to be considered is  what  steps, if any,  we  should take  tocheckmate the possible intentions of the Central Powers as outlined above, if put intoexecution.  It appears desirable that we  should  have some  policy on this question,even if it is a negative one.  At any rate it ought to be considered in all its bearings.If the plans of the Central Powers should materialise on the lines suggested above, ourposition at the Dardanelles would become  precarious, for the enemy would then haveample supplies of ammunition, and it might be difficult for us even to  hold on.    7. The alternatives would appear to be (1) to make a renewed effort  at  Gallipoliin the hope of obtaining command of the Straits  before the arrival  of  the  CentralPowers.   We have had so many disappointments in this  region that no confidence canbe felt that such an effort would succeed.  Or (2) to  endeavour to  rally the wholeof the Balkan States to our side by the promise of military support in that region.    8. Examining this latter proposal first in its political aspects, our procedure wouldbe somewhat as follows :     We might point out to Greece that  in the event of an alliance between  Bulgaria         and the  Central Powers, her  position would be gravely menaced.  Serbia         would probably  be completely over-run  by the Central  Powers and might         disappear as a  military factor  in  the  situation.  Greece  would  then  be         menaced on  all  her  northern frontiers.   Not only would Bulgaria occupy         Kavala  and  a  considerable portion of Macedonia, but  in  addition, either1 pL      Austria or Bulgaria  would in all  probability acquire Salonica, and Greece         would  be forced  back almost to the limits of continental territory  occupied   5     before  the Balkan  wars.   Moreover,  opportunities  for  further expansion    )     would be compromised for an indefinite period.    -y   [1052]
     9. To Roumania it might  be represented that  the moment had now come for her to enter the war if her aspirations were ever to be realised.  Failing immediate action she would find herself surrounded by enemies on every sida  On the other hand, il she would only stand firm now, she, in conjunction with Serbia and with such force as the Allies could spare, would compel the Central  Powers to detach an  army of such size in order to realise their objective that in all probability the attempt would never be made.     10. To Serbia, Greece, and Roumania, it might  then be represented that, if the three  States would only have  the courage to act  in unison to defend  their general interests, they  are  strong enough to hold an Austro-German advance, and  until the Germans have definitely mastered Serbian resistance it is most unlikely that Bulgaria will risk an attack upon  three enemies.     11. In order to overcome the reluctance of the three States to face the  danger which  threatens  them, it has  been suggested that an offer  might be made that the Allies would send a material reinforcement to support them.     12. It should be represented to the States concerned that if they stood firm it is absolutely certain  that  Bulgaria would  not  take action against the xlllies.  On the contrary, it is by no means unlikely that, if the steps outlined  above were taken, the strong elements in Bulgaria which are  sympathetic  to the cause  of the  Allies would- rally, create a great outcry against the policy of  the present  Government, and compel them to make a complete volte-face and  to unite themselves to the cause of the Allies in order to obtain the best terms they could.     13. The question may now be examined in  its military  aspects.   It must  be admitted that the idea of committing the Allies to  yet another campaign  in  this part -of the world, involving the  detachment of a considerable force, is most objectionable from a military point of view.  It can only be justified if the very considerable military forces of the Balkan States referred to  above  are set in motion.   Anyhow, not a single man would be moved until a definite guarantee had  been obtained  from Greece and Roumania that they would co-operate.     14.  It has been  calculated that the largest  military force which  could be based on the Salonica railway is six or seven  Divisions.   Possibly, however, this might  be increased, if the whole of the food and forage for the  army were obtained from Roumania, thus setting free a portion of  the resources of the railway for larger forces.     15.  It is possible that a force of this size could be  got together if the French were willing to divert their proposed offensive from the Dardanelles to  the Balkans, but it would have to be recognised that this practically implies abandoning the offensive at the Dardanelles with all the objections that accompany it.     16.  Whether the States concerned  would be induced to co-operate with the Allies for a force of this size remains  to be seen.     17.  The question has also to be considered from the French point of view.  The one  thing that General Joffre fears in any extension of French enterprise in the Near East  is that this  should  create further drains upon his resources.   It  is not so muchthat he would object to sending four Divisions as that he would object to the possibility-of  having to send  more Divisions to help  the  four Divisions through.   Probably, therefore, we should meet with  strong opposition from our Ally if we were to put this fresh proposal forward.     18. If, however, it should be considered worth while to make the attempt there is not a moment to lose.  A good many military arrangements  would have  to  be made. The railway from  Salonica would require improvement and the  addition of rolling- stock,  and this ought to be prepared for at once.  The transport problem  at  the railhead, which is a very difficult one, would require immediate study, and steps would have to be taken to collect what is required with the  shortest possible delay.  Otherwise we should be forestalled by the  enemy-though  it must be remembered  that  the knowledge that the Allies  were coming would  have a tremendous moral  effect on Serbian resistance.   It might be worth while to sound  M. Venizelos and  M. BfatiaSowery privately and informally even before Bulgaria has given  her reply.
     19. The objections and difficulties in the way of this policy are very evident, but,if we simply acquiesce in the Bulgarian refusal, there would seem  to be a real dangerthat the Balkan  States may be  politically destroyed piecemeal, and, unless we havebefore then gained  the possession of the Gallipoli Peninsula, we may be driven out of:the Dardanelles.     20. As before  stated the choice appears to lie between&apos;a great renewed effort atthe  Dardanelles and some  such policy as  has  been indicated above.  The questionappears to be one on which a decision cannot be long deferred.                                                                    M. P. A. H.
