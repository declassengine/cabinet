September 1915.SECRET.                                                                     O--                                                                     &amp; G.-24.APPRECIATION  OF THE  SITUATION IN THE BALKANS BY  THE                  GENERAL  STAFF,  WAR OFFICE.    1. IN view  of the situation  created in the Balkaus by the Bulgarian orders formobilization, and the evidently anticipated attack on  Serbia  by an Austro-Germanforce, what  force of Allied troops  should  be sent (1) to  protect  Serbia  from  thecombined attack of  the  Central  Powders and  Bulgaria, or (2) to enable Greece tomobilize  against Bulgaria, thus  checking  an  attack  by Bulgaria upon Serbia andleaving Serbia to defend herself, as she did previously, against the Austro-Germanattack ?    2. Bulgaria  can mobilize a field army of rather over 300,000, but is believed to berather short  of munitions.   She has  probably sufficient for a three months&apos; campaign.Her troops  are good  as  compared  to  the  Greek forces, but there  is little to choosebetween them and those of the Serbs.    The  Greeks  are short of rifles, of munitions, and of warlike stores generally.    The  fighting qualities of  the Roumanian army are to a certain extent an unknownfactor.    The  strength of the various field armies is as follows :              Bulgaria   ..      ...     ..     . .      ..     ..  300,000             Serbia      ..      ..      ..     ..      ..     ..  250,000             Greece     ..      ..      ..     ..             ..  200,000             Eoumania   ..      ..      ..     ..      ..     ..  350,000    The  Roumanians could probably  detach not  more than  100,000 for operationsagainst Bulgaria.  The troops available on either side would be as follows : Roumanians ..      ..     ..      ..      ..      ..  100,000Greeks     ..      ..     ..      ..      ..      ..  200,000Serbs      ..      ..            ..             ..  250,0000                 Total   ..      ..      ..     ..  550,000Bulgaria    ..      ..     ..      ..     &quot;..     ..  300,000Central Powers      ..     ...      ..    (to start with)  250,000                              Total   ..     ..      .. .     ..  550,000    3. With regard to  proposition No. 1,  the Central  Powers could increase  theirforces to 450,000, which would mean that, with  the Bulgarian army, there would be750,000 men in a very advantageous strategical position for  operations against Serbia.It is considered that, to  enable Serbia to resist a strong attack from the north, as wellas to defend the line of communication  with Salonica, she should be supported by300,000 men of the Allied armies in addition to the  Greek army.  It should be notedthat the Greek  army will only be employed against  the  Bulgarians,  and that toneutralise the Bulgarian army and safeguard the lines of commuuication the  Greekswould have to  be  reinforced  by 150,000 men,  which  would probably consist of100,000 Allies and 50,000 Serbs.  This would leave 200,000 Allies and the remainderof the Serbian army to  oppose an invasion from the north  and north-west, assumingthat the Allied troops can reach the selected position in time.  The question of timin these operations will be one of great importance owing to the approach of the wintemonths, when transport  in Serbia will meet with serious difficulties.   Calculations otime are shown in Appendix A.                                                L
     4. With regard to proposition No. 2 : If the role of the  Allies were restricted toneutralising Bulgaria without undertaking  operations to protect Serbia thus leavingSerbia free to  defend herself against the  Austro-G-erman attack, as she did previouslywith success-the Allied force required would evidently be the numbers above statedas necessary to reinforce Greece in her defensive operations against Bulgaria.     It is, perhaps, a  coincidence  that the figure  worked out by our General  Staff isidentical with  the  size of the force asked for by the Greeks.  The co-operation ofRoumania against  Bulgaria would  be  a matter of the highest importance, but  shecould only detach  100,000 men  at the  most,  owing to the threat on her northern&apos;frontier.     If Roumania can be  induced to take action  in north-western Bulgaria, it wouldgreatly help to prevent the Central Powers and Bulgaria joining hands.     5. It must be  clearly understood that the role of the 150,000 Allied troops forwhich Greece has asked, and which will, if necessary,  be sent to Salonica, will in  thefirst instance be  restricted to enabling and assisting  the Greek army to protect  theSerbian flank and the line of communication with Salonica.     It is thought that the lateness of the season will prevent the  northern invasionbecoming so powerful as to drive back the Serbian army beyond its strategical position,provided that the Serbians are relieved  of anxiety on account of Bulgaria.   Otherwise,to render the situation secure, further troops will have to be sent out by the Allies, asis contemplated in the first proposition.
APPENDIX   A.     1, THE present capacity of the Salonica-Nisch (single) Railway was reported inApril 1915 to be  only 6 trains a day in each  direction, but with  extra  rolling-stockand  the  construction of additional passing places  the capacity of the line may beeasily  augmented to 12 trains a  day each way.   Construction  work  has been inprogress for some time, but the  bad  condition  of  the  locomotives, bridges,  andpermanent way, as well as the lack of good railway personnel, would limit the capacity(at the most favourite estimate) to  15 trains each way in. the 24 hours.     2. A division requires 85 trains composed  of  specific  kinds of rolling-stock.(In Serbia the rolling-stock would be a haphazard collection.)   Leaving  1 train aday for the inhabitants and the requirements of the Serbian forces, the transport of adivision  would  require  at  least   61- days.   Three-quarters of  a  train  per diem isnecessary for the supply of  each  division.   For  10 divisions  therefore 8 trains perdiem would be necessary.     The transport by rail  from Salonica to Nisch of 200,000 men (say 10  divisions)could hardly be completed  in under 3 months.   It  would therefore be  impracticableto move the whole force by rail.  The railway would at first be fully occupied by theformation of advanced  supply depots, and  subsequently in supplying the troops afterthey had reached their destinations.     3. The time required to move  the troops by road to Northern Serbia must next beconsidered.     The lack of road communication along a considerable stretch of the Vardar Valleymakes a long detour via Monastir and Keupruli inevitable.     The distance from Salonica to Kragujevac or Ujitze  by road is  approximately360 miles.  Although the route at  certain points diverges a considerable distance fromthe main line, the railways  branching to Monastir  and Ujitze would materially assistin the supply of the troops during  the march.     Assuming the march to be completed before the November rains had affected theroad surface, a force of 10 divisions might be established on the Zajecar-Kragujevac-Ujitze line within 36 days  of the  disembarkation of the last  division at Salonica, orsay,  66 days after the arrival at Salonica of  the first transports.  This is a favourableestimate, for some confusion must be caused  by our troops perpetually crossing theSerbian lines of communication and supply.     4. The most expeditious method Avould  manifestly be for the first 5 or 6 divisionsto march while the full  capacity  of the line was being used for forwarding supplies.The  remaining 5 or 4 divisions, would then be railed to their destination.     In this way the whole of the force for Northern Serbia might be on the selectedpositions within 35 days of the disembarkation of the sixth division.     Assuming that each division will take 3 days to disembark, the whole force mightbe in position  in 53  days from, the  arrival  of  the  first lot of transports at Salonica,provided the November rains had not delayed the marching columns.     5. The force of 100,000 men (say 5 divisions) destined for  points such as Ishtip,Kumanovo, Pirot, and the Serbo-Bulgarian frontier could not  disembark simultaneouslywith the  forces destined for Northern Serbia.  If no force is simultaneously sent  toNorthern Serbia, and the 5 divisions for the  Bulgarian  frontier are all disembarkedwithin a  period of 20 days at Salonica, these latter could reach  their frontier  positionsby road  and rail  on the 9th, 19th, 21st, [28th, and 31st days after disembarkationcommenced.   Marching  columns  would  in this&apos; case  also be  obliged  to  take thecircuitous road via Monastir and Keupruli.     6. The whole force of 3.00,0.00 men (say 15 divisions).would  require 12&apos; trains aday to maintain their supply.
     7. The railway arrangements must  be undertaken by British railway personnelthroughout, and the line must  be handed over entirely to British control.   A largecontingent of engineers for construction  work is essential, as the bridges will requireextensive repairs at the outset, and important sidings are still unfinished.     8. The use of the Greek portion of the main line, and also of the Monastir line, bythe Greek forces is not contemplated, as they would presumably require only theSalonica-Dedeagatch system.   &quot;  9. If the Central Powers invade Serbia in any strength before the 1st November,their forces may well  have reached the line  allotted  to  the Entente forces in the northbefore five Anglo-French divisions can reach it.  Assuming that the first three divisionswere moved by.rail,  they  might, if  disembarked  by the Gth October, be on theirpositions about Kragujevac  by the  30th October, and a fourth division might arrive;   re during the second week of November.
