Paper G.-26 (b).]Nish, No. 451,Oct. 14.                       . OCTOBER 14.    188. On the night of the 14th October it was officially knownthat the Bulgarians had attacked. all along the Serbian frontier,and that a state of war existed between the two States.Military attache,Salonica, Mb. 37,Oct. 14, 10P.U.Some, No. 996,Oct. 14.     189. At Salonica the military situation was as follows :      French. General  Sarrail  with one  complete division,  one                 reserve brigade, and some mounted troops.     British-Third  brigade of 10th division.  The, division  had                 left  Mudros for Salonica  that day, hut  had no                 transport.     Greek. One division, and another following.     ;The Serbian representatives were urging an immediate move, but General  Sarrail was awaiting instructions.   He  consented,; however,  to send detachments  to guard  the  railway opposite: Strumnitza.   The Serbians continued  to  beg that everything should be done to maintain an impression that large Allied forces were coming.     190.  The difficulty of determining  the next move lay in the attitude of the King of Greece, who was becoming more and more obstructive.  1 In a conversation with the  Russian Minister (reported; from Rome) he had said that M. Venizelos was a hasty man, of whom he was very  glad  to have got rid,  and that  the attitude of. Great  Britain had  been &quot; unqualifiable.&quot;  He repudiated  any-obligations to Serbia.  He had no understanding with the King of Bulgaria, but the Bulgarian Government had  assured the Greek Government that they would  not. be attacked.  The terms of the supposed treaty between  Germany and Bulgaria were an invention of the British Foreign Office.     In these circumstances, intervention from Salonica was very difficult, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs thought that at the present moment  Italy could best assist by very vigorous action on  the Austrian  frontier for which he  was pressing,  and which he was prepared to see carried through at even, great sacrifice.&apos; He hinted at the possibility of material support later.  He thought that our contribution of 200,000 men would hot be nearly sufficient without help from Greece and  Roumania.     [1099-3]                                         B
     191. In any case, the  susceptibilities of the Serbian  Govern-ment were a  serious obstacle to  direct Italian action  throughAlbania.     Sir C.  des Graz reported that he  had spoken to the Prime Nish, No. 452,Minister with regard to Italian aid for Serbia.   The Prime Minister Oct. 14.said that the Serbian Government did not consider it possible for j5JpJ*Jhedtroops to come through Albania with artillery and transport owing Reevedto the absence of  roads, and he  added that it  would  be in the 2-30 A.M., 15th.highest degree unpleasant for Serbia if Italians came  into  Albaniaand stayed there.     Montenegro would offer an easier though still difficult passagefor troops,  or the  idea  might  be considered  of a  base on theDalmatian coast connected  with  a railway, or again, an  advancemight be made through Bulgarian territory.     The attitude  of Montenegro was denned two days later.   On Cettinje, No. 151,the  16th, Count de Salis reported that the Montenegrin  Govern- Oct. 16.ment had that day  made  the following communication to  the g.e1s0?^le(irepresentatives of the four Allied Powers:                        Received12 P.M., 18th.    &quot;Bulgaria  having attacked Serbia, and  a great danger menacingcommon cause of Allies in Balkans, Montenegrin Government is more thanever convinced that action of Allied troops on  coast of Montenegro  or atRagusa wherever (? General Staffs) might think best would be of thegreatest use to common cause.  Enemy would be attacked in flank, menacedin Serbia, and paralysed towards Italy.    &quot; Montenegrin army of 40,000 men awaits with impatience  an  earlyunion with Allied armies in this common action.&quot;                          OCTOBER 15.     192. The only immediate action  open to us was the proposed Foreign Office tobombardment of Bulgarian ports,  which at the  last moment had Paris, No. 2336;been postponed  till  the  Allies  united in a  declaration of war. ^0]ne&apos; .^o. 1862;Sir E. Grey now represented to Paris,  Borne,  and Petrograd that No. 2400 Oct. 15.Bulgaria having announced at Athens that she was at war as an ally Despatchedwith the  Central  Powers   (Athens   1045,   14th  October),  His 7-15 P.M.Majesty&apos;s Government  thought it  necessary to declare  a state ofwar with Bulgaria at once,  as the port of Dedeagatch  would beused against us.     193. At the same time Sir  H. MacMahon was  informed that Foreign Office towar would  be declared against Bulgaria that night.   Days of grace Cairo, No. 785,would not be granted and the necessary steps  were  to be taken to     *?&apos;h ,secure the detention of all Bulgarian vessels in Egyptian  ports and 7.30 P.M.waters.                          OCTOBER 16.     194. By this time it  was clear that there was  little hope of Petrograd.direct assistance from  Bussia.  The  Minister of Eoreign Affairs No. 1506, Oct. 14.had expressed  himself  delighted with the action we were  taking Petrograd,to revive the Balkan League, but in a later conversation he stated No. 1513, Oct. 15.that he  did not think it was possible for the Russian  army to  offer g.gS0Ppt^ledRoumania  any kind  of assistance  that  would  be likely to induce Receivedher to take the field at once, but that when Russia was in a position io-40 A.M., 16th.to place more men in the field they would for strategical reasonsbe sent  to the northern army near Dvinsk.     M.  Sazonof added at present there were no more than 700,000armed men at the front.     195. A strong  display  of force,  therefore, being out  of  the Foreign Office toquestion for the present, the only course seemed to be to offer  Greece Athens, No. 902,other inducements.                                    .           r)Ctltwi     Sir F. Elliot was  instructed that, while  it was a great disap-    P-Mipointment  to find that Greece was not about to support Serbia, andthat  we could  not think  the  explanation  of  which the  Greek

Minister in London had given us a copy was satisfactory or absolved               her from her obligations, yet we  were prepared to make her the               following offer:                    If Greece was prepared to give  support as an ally to Serbia,               now that she has been attacked by Bulgaria, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-               ment were willing to put her in possession of Cyprus.   Should she               join the Allies for all purposes,  she  would naturally have a share               with them in the advantages secured at the end of the war; but the               offer of  Cyprus was made by His  Majesty&apos;s Government indepen-               dently, on condition that  Greece  gave immediate and full support               with her army to Serbia.                   This communication  Sir E.  EUiot was directed to  make at               once.   He was to understand it was quite independent of  the other               proposal which  was  now being  considered  by the  Boumanian               Government, and he was to say nothing to Greece about the latter               proposal until the answer  from Boumania had been received.                   196. Simultaneously, steps were taken to get the  promised               troops released from France, and to this end Lord Bertie was made               acquainted with the situation as summarised by Lord Kitchener.                   Lord Kitchener stated that at the Conference which was held               at Calais, and at  the Meeting  at  Chantilly, it was clearly pointed               out that there were  no troops available in England for the expedi-               tion to Salonica, and that the required troops therefore would  have               to come from Erance.   He moreover pointed out that considerably               larger forces than 150,000 men would  be required to turn the scales               against the  invaders of Serbia,  and  owing to  the difficulty  of               providing this larger force  he considered an active offensive in               Erance would be the best support  to Serbia in the circumstances.                   General Joffre&apos;s view had consistently been that 150,000 troops               in Serbia would be of great value  and could be safely employed,               but he had never explained how these troops were to be  supplied.                   &quot; The British  Government felt that  it was now necessary for               their military situation in the Near East  and India, as well as to               carry out the engagements  entered into  in  order  to confirm the               Erench  promise  to send  150,000  men to Salonica (which was               originally given without consultation  with His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-               ment), to send to the East no less  than eight divisions from France,               of which two would be  Indian for India, and unless General Joffre               could resume the defence of the position south of Arras the troops               would not be available to  do this.&quot;  Lord Bertie was requested to               insist on General Joffre taking over this part of the line.                   197. Lord Bertie was further informed that during  the week               Sir E.  Grey  had defined  the  actual  position  to the  Erench               Ambassador as follows :                    &quot; We are preparing to despatch, without delay, to the East the contin-               gent of troops promised.  Where these troops will be disembarked, and the               rise to be made  of them, will be decided  in consultation with the French               military and naval authorities.&quot;                   When  the troops  were  ready, the military authorities would               have to decide the best use to be made of them.  If Greece did not               by that time co-operate, His Majesty&apos;s Government were not bound,               and it  might be  considered  unsafe or impracticable, to  despatch               troops inland from Salonica.   But we  were preparing and should in               any event send to  the East the contingent  promised.                   Next day, however, Lord Bertie reported that the Minister forj)   t ] a       War had left for London that morning to  see Lord  Kitchener, andI-57PP.M. deceived ne therefore proposed to take no action pending further instructions3-50 P.M.         from Sir E. Grey.Petrograd,            198. There was also continued uncertainty as to when RussiaDe0spatehe??pjff&apos;  could take  action-   Sir G. Buchanan reported that he had  beenReceived 5-55 P.M. informed by M. Sazonof that the  Emperor had agreed to join theForeign Office toParis, No. 2349,Oct. 16.Despatched5-50 P.M.Paris, No. 771,Oct. 17.
Allied Governments in v declaring war  on Bulgaria,  and that anImperial manifesto was being drawn up to that effect.  rlBut theprecise date for the Russian operations against Varna  and Bourgascould not be fixed.  They would; probably commence in about threedays&apos;  time, and M. &quot;Sazohof 5hoped&apos; that we  would  not on  thataccount defer &quot;the bombardment  of  Dedeagatch, since it was notnecessary  that  the two 1 bombardments should commence  simul-taneously.                          OCTOBER ,17.    199. The reply of Roumania to  our  proposals now  came to Bucharest,hand, and it was a refusal.                                       No.;659, Oct. 16,    Sir G. Barclay reported that the Prime  Minister had given Jj^J^^him his answer the previous evening, and&apos; it was to the  following in A.M.,&apos;l7th.effect:     He regretted that he  could not fall  in with  our proposalbecause:      (1.)  It involved what for  two or three months could he no           more  than a demonstration on  our part, during which           period Roumania would have to fight unsupported.     (2.) He was more than ever  convinced from his latest infor-           mation  that Greece would not move with ns at this           moment.     (3.)  The strength of  the force we offered was insufficient to           bring up the total arrayed on our  side to  the available           forces of our enemies.     In regard to the first point,  he  said that if our troops couldonly reach Salonica by the end  of the year they could - not take thefield until  February.  In regard  to the  second point, he said thatthe. officers in the Greek army were confident of the  ultimate victoryof Germany.  With regard to the third point, he said that  to  thebest of his belief the total forces held available by  our enemies forthis theatre of war,: exclusive of the Gallipoli Peninsula, were about1/250,000,  composed as follows:     &apos; 200,000 Turks, who would  co-operate with the Bulgarians ;     700,000 Austro-Germans   (200,000   operating  against  the               &quot;Serbians,  leaving 500,000 in reserve/which might               be directed against Roumania); and     350,000 Bulgarians.     On  the other  hand,  our total forces would be only 950,000, composed  as follows :      250,000 Serbians ;     200,000 Anglo-French;  and    &apos; 500,000 Roumanians.     The only hope the Prime Minister would  give  was that if we undertook to send 500,000 men he would reconsider the question, and would be prepared to  enter, the field as soon as these 500,000 were ready to attack the  enemy, but on the  assumption that the military situation in Gallipoli  and on the  Russian front had  not altered for the worse, i.e., that  we had  not reduced our forces at Gallipoli and that Serbia was still fighting.  He also  said he must ask that the war material, which was indispensable  for Roumania, should be sent as rapidly as possible  by  the Russian route, which was the only one now available.      200.  In explanation  of this reply the military attache stated, Bucharest, that the Prime Ministers statement had in part been dictated by the&apos; No- 660* 0ct-16- General  Staff, who held that our  most recent proposal,  while  gT^Received inviting Roumania to begin hostilities atonce,, gave no-, certain) 4-45^. 17th. prospect of establishing a line  of communication for replenishing her reserves of ammunition after three months of hostilities.

Received10 A.M 18th.Athens,-No. 1053,Despatched 2 P.M.Received 6*20 P.M.     The Roumanian Government considered  their expectant atti-tude was justified by the fact that they were already HamperingBulgaria,,since so long as their intentions were unknown Bulgariawas &quot;obliged&apos;to retain two divisions on her northern frontier.     In the opinion of the military attache, what&quot; the Prime Minister:was  really suggesting was that Roumania would move only whenthe Dardanelles were opened for the passage of the Allied ships.     The only strategy, therefore, that  would  favourably influenceRoumanian opinion was one which aimed at--     (1.)  Forcing a passage to Constantinople, either by the&apos; Darda-           nelles or through Bulgaria;  and     (2.)  Invading Bulgaria by the Serbian and Allied forces.     He added  that  it seemed  inevitable  that the Germans wouldsooner or later gain access to the northern  end of the Bulgarianrailway system, and that the only course left open to us, if we wereto prevent the transit of munitions to Constantinople, was to strikeat the south-eastern end of the system near Demotica.     He thought it was worthy of consideration whether the greaterpart  of the Serbian army could not be more effectively employed&apos;in an offensive against Bulgaria, leaving  only a  weak containingforce against the Austro-Germans who, for the attainment of their&quot;object, have many difficulties to overcome even in  the absence ofserious military opposition.     In a later telegram he reported that there were now said to beseven  German divisions on the front, Semendria-Gradisea, and:four  near Belgrade, and that the proportion of artillery units washigh;  while at Nish Sir C. des Graz had heard,  but not been:informed officially, that the Bulgarians had cut  the railway nearVrania and blown up several small bridges.     201.  It will  be observed that in the Roumanian reply to ourproposals for extending the Entente alliance, no account was takenof the  Greek army in enumerating the forces that would be available.For  this, omission  Sir E. Elliot had  an explanation  to offer.   Hereported  that some time  ago the Roumanian military attache atAthens had obtained possession of a report from the Greek GeneralStaff to the King of Greece to the effect that the Greek army wasnot in a condition to undertake any warlike operations whatever.He understood that this report  had been  used by the RoumanianPrime  Minister as. an argument against negotiations for co-operationwith Greece.     He  had  also  heard that further sinister reports had beenfurnished by the  Roumanian military  attache, whose recall washighly desirable.  He was a dangerous German agent.     202.This same day  our  offer  of Cyprus was presented atAthens, but M. Zaimis said he would not reply until he had seenthe King, which he would do at once.     In making the offer Sir E. Elliot had pointed out the uniqueopportunity for Greece,, that  Cyprus  would  be  assured to herwhatever was-the result  of the war  and that  the entry of Greecewould  probably decide Roumania.   He found that M. Zaimis hadlearnt from Bucharest, of the communication  we had made there,,and Sir E, Elliot thought that a similar communication should bemade to Athens as soon as possible.     The conviction of British tenderness for Bulgaria was hard toremove, and Sir E. Elliot suggested that we should make a definitepromise of Thrace, as a convincing proof that the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards Bulgaria had  finally changed.    A  tendency towards action was  beginning to make itself feltin the army and among the people, but it  must - be stronger than itwas before it would influence the King.    [1099-3]                                            C
     M. Venizelos, when Sir F. Elliot told him of the new offer, was Athens, No. 1055,delighted and  thought it would have an excellent  effect on public Oct.17-opinion.  But  he too would like to see it followed by the offer of Syed  9 P&apos;M&apos;Thrace, conditionally, of course, on the Greek Government co-operat- 8*45 A.M., 18th.ing with us for all purposes.     M. Venizelos also thought that it would be better for us not tocouple warnings with the offer, but to reserve them for use in casethe country wished to join but the King continued to refuse.     203. Erance had now adopted the British proposal for declaring war, and Lord Bertie reported  that the following communique had Paris, No. 772, been issued :                                                    JJct- 17\  ,                                        ,         .                 Despatched     &quot;La Bulgarie etant entree en action a cote des ennemis et contre un des 7-45 P.M. Received Allies de la France, le Gouvernement de la Republique constate que  1&apos;etat 10-45 P.M. de guerre  existe  entre la  Bulgarie et la France a partir du  16  octobre . 6 heures du matin, du fait de la Bulgarie.&quot;     General  Sarrail now announced bis intention  of moving his General Staff whole division into the Vardar Vallev.                              appreciation,     There was  still a  difficulty, however, about  moving from   &apos;  &apos; France the troops which were needed  to back the declaration.     Lord  Bertie telegraphed that the military attache had just had Paris, No. 774, an interview with the &quot; chef de cabinet&quot; of the Minister of War, and ^ct-17- been shown the shorthand report of the Ohantilly conference.  There  745^ &quot;Receive appeared to be no mention in it of what troops,  British or French,  9-40 P.M. were to  take  up the line &quot;vacated by the  divisions intended for Salonica.   The French point of  view was that, as the British  troops were much more dense on the ground than  the French, they could well fill up the space vacated.     204. Eussia seemed inclined to take such action as was  within her power.     Sir R. Rodd reported that the  despatch of 300,000 rifles to  Rome, No. 1008, Archangel had been agreed to, and  Sir G.  Buchanan  had been  0ct- 17- officially informed that the Russian  forces  destined to co-operate  ^50Pp ^Receivedwith the Allies in the Balkan Peninsula would  be composed of  a  10-35 WM.brigade of infantry, a detachment of mountain artillery, and a  sotnia petrograd,of Cossacks.   These  forces would be concentrated  at Archangel, No. 1522, Oct. 17.where they might be expected to arrive in about six weeks.

It was now abundantly clear that the forces immediatelyavailable were insufficient to  give  the necessary backing to  anattempt to  revive the  Balkan League.   In telegraphing to  theEntente capitals the gist of the Roumanian reply to our offer, Sir E. Foreign Office toGrey stated that under  the circumstances it was useless to pursue Paris.

Our attache at Salonica had Athens, No. 1057,reported on the 17th October  that  the Serbian attache there had 0ct-18-received a telegram from the Serbian headquarters that morning to ilnoon  Receivedthe effect that a brigade of Bulgarian infantry and two regiments of 2-35 P.M.cavalry had arrived at  the Orient railway station south of  Vrania,that the line had been cut,  and that another column was advancingon Kochana.    It was in  consequence of this intelligence that General Sarrailwas pushing up into the Vardar Valley west of Doiran.    General Mahon had now transport  enough for  one infantrybrigade and one field artillery brigade, but on orders from  Londondeclined to move.

Bodd&apos;s own; view was that Italy would be able               to do more; tos relieve Serbia by pressing her offensive home and by               using all available troops to follow  up the success she  hoped to               attain than  by  detaching troops for service elsewhere.Rome, No. 1011,Oct. 18.Despatched 9 P.M.Received 10*45 P.M.OCTOBER 19:Foreign Office toAthens, No. 922,Oct. 19.Despatched1-30 P.M.                   208. More clearly than ever the situation hung on the effect of               our offers to Greece; and here&apos; a difficulty arose over the question of               adding Thrace; to which M. Venizelos&apos;appeared to attach so much               importance.                   In the view of our Foreign Office, the anti-German element in-.               Bulgaria, was. still, a factor  in the. situations which it was; unwise to               ignore or discourage  on  the- bare  chance of  winning  Greece.               Accordingly Sir F. Elliot was  informed  that the offer which  he               proposed1 would have the effect of uniting Bulgaria absolutely and               determining the nation to fight to the end at all costs.   It did  not               therefore seem desirable to make such an offer,  unless we were sure               that it would, definitely secure Greek co-operation.                   It- was  suggested  to  Sir. E.  Elliot that  he  might sound               M. Venizelos omthe1 subject; and the latter might  then ascertain               from M. Zaimis whether an assurance of Greek co-operation would               be given.Athens, No. 1067.      209. Crossing this  telegram,, Sir E.  Elliot,  reported! that  theT)Ct     d       offer of Cyprus was; to be, discussed by the Council of Ministers1-20PP.M  Received; ^na^       ^ne Greek calculation seemed to be largely arithmetical:5-58P.M.         &quot;How many Allied troops, are  required  to make  Serbians plus               Greeks plus Allies equal to Germans plus Austrians plus Bulgarians               plus Turks?&quot;                   (It  will be noted that Boumanians  do  not enter into  the.               calculation.)Athens, No. 1069,      210; Colonel  Napier  reported  the  progress  of  the  GreekI)Ct Xt&apos;h d       concentration, and added  that  the general plan was said to  be4-30Pp.M.eReceived for the Illrd  Army Corps to  go  from  Salonica to  Kiklis,  the9-30 P.M.

In  another telegram he gave the last word; of the Greek               appreciation of the military outlook and.  his colleagues&apos; reception               of it, as follows: Athens, No. 1072,     &quot;At: interview. tOrday Minister of War expressed doubt whether oppor-Oct-19.          tune moment had yet arrived for Greece to; enter into- war, although  herDespatched 4 P.M.  sympathies are with.the Entente.Received:ll-25p;M:    &quot;Military attaches; of Erance, Rnssia,:and.

Time should               be allowed for the effect of the offers which had been, or were about                   [1099-3]          - ;                             .  D
to be made, and for the  arrival of a large force of  Allied  troops.Scepticism  as to our  intention to  send them  was  exercising  apowerful restraining influence in Athens.     211. Later on Sir F. Elliot reported he had been told that the Athens, No. 1070,King had said to a friend that when he was ready he would sweep Oct. 19.the Allies into the sea.  Sir E. Elliot said he did not believe this, and ^3ved 11P?MT&quot;added that it would be contrary to  the feelings of the whole nation,and that the reply would obviously be instantaneous and destructive.     Nevertheless, the  concentration  of troops reported by ColonelNapier  gave ground for  this suspicion, since  it was  different fromwhat M. Venizelos thought it would be.     212. All this  time  our troops  at  Salonica  remained withoutorders to proceed.   Apart from  the  still uncertain attitude ofGreece  there were  other considerations  which made it  extremelydifficult to decide what their orders should be.  Some of them wereset out in the following message forwarded by Sir G. Barclay from Bucharest,Mr.  Bouchier  to   Lord  Curzon  in  which the  military attache No. 666, Oct. 19.concurred:-                                            &apos;          Despatched   -                                                                   9&apos;30 P.M. Received    &quot; I regard any advance north of Strnmnitza as dangerous in view of the 9&apos;50 A.M., 20th.distance  from naval  base,  configuration of the country,  danger of flankattacks from  Bulgaria, and  hostility of the native  population, to whom ourpresence in Macedonia will be represented as an effort to maintain Serbianrule.    &quot; All Bulgarians are  most reluctant to  attack us, but such a movementon our part will add 400,000 well-armed troops to the forces  actively opposedto us.    &quot; So far, there is no desire in Bulgaria to join in a German  advance onConstantinople.  In view of the supreme importance of Constantinople andthe danger that an ineffectual campaign in Macedonia may weaken if notparalyse  our further efforts  to prevent an eastward march  of the Germans,1 advise strong concentration in Eastern Thrace with  Russian co-operationfrom  the Black Sea  Coast.   Abandonment of  Serbia   would be  onlytemporary.  The success of an effort at relief is now doubtful.  Our ultimatevictory is surely the primary consideration for her and for us.&quot;     The only further development this day was that Sir G. Buchanan Petrograd,reported that the  following instructions had been telegraphed on No. 1530, Oct. 19.the 18th October to the Admiral Commanding Black  Sea Fleet:-  Despatched                                                                   9*10 P.M. -Received     &quot;You  are to bombard  Varna or Bourgas at  your discretion, but  to ^ A.M., 20th.arrange with the Allies so that the bombardment may be simultaneous withtheir attack on Dedeagatch.     &quot; Black Sea transports are also to be got ready, as threat of a Russianlanding  on tire Bulgarian  coast would relieve the Bulgarian  pressure  on Serbia.     &quot; Fortifications and works are to be attacked, towns spared, and though actual date is left for you to arrange, the operation is to be executed without loss of time.&quot;                            OCTOBER 20.      213.  In further explanation of the British attitude to the pro- posed new offer to  Greece, Sir E.  Grey informed  Sir F. Elliot that Foreign Office to we had no objection to her  obtaining  the coast  of  Thrace, but  it Athens,  No. 926, gave an impression of weakness to be making continual offers on 0ct 20* the chance  of getting Greek co-operation.   We were  preparing  to JfjpJ^ join with the other Allies in promising the coast of Thrace to Greece, but only in return for a definite offer  to co-operate.   Greece must first make that offer, and ask for the coast of Thrace.      The Ambassadors at  Paris, Petrograd, and Rome were accord- Foreign Office to ingly directed merely to inform their respective Ministers for Foreign Paris, No. 2365; Affairs  that His Majesty&apos;s Government had offered Cyprus to Greece Petro^ad. if she would support Serbia with her army, but had not yet received No. lS^Oct-To. a?ePlv*                                               *            Despatched                                                                    1*50 P.M.
                   214.  But before these communications could be made the offer              had been refused, not only categorically, but with an  intimation              that no other offer not even Thrace would move Greece from her              neutrality.Athens, No. 1073,      Sir  F.  Elliot  reported  that  he had that  morning been  toOct. 20.         M. Zaimis to ask for his answer to  the offer of Cyprus.   M. Zaimis3-??MCheReceived said that in view of the military  opinion that  it would be only6-45 P.M.        courting disaster to go to the help of  Serbia, it had been decided              not to take  action, but to maintain  a  neutrality benevolent towards              the Allies.   No offers whatever would move the Government from              that attitude.                   To the  question as to what number of Allied  troops in Mace-              donia would be sufficient to induce Greece  to join  us, he replied              that however manv were sent the General Staff were convinced that              they would  arrive too late, and that  it was a mistake to send them              there at  all, as they could  be better employed  in Erance or Asia              Minor.Athens, No. 1074,      215. In a supplementary telegram, Sir  F. Elliot added that atOct. 20.         his interview with M. Zaimis the latter alluded to  the  idea of the5:lfp M deceived acquisition  of the  coast of Thrace which had been put forward as10 P.M.         a personal suggestion by the French Minister in conversation with              M. Rhallys, but  it had evidently  had no effect upon his views as              guided by the opinion of the General Staff.                   The Russian Minister believed that  the  opinion of the General              Staff had not so much to do with the refusal as a rival offer from              the Central Powers.Athens, No. 1075,      Sir E.  Elliot reported  that at the  interview with  M. ZaimisT)Gt&apos;2f\a      that morning his Russian colleague, who  accompanied him, stated5-15PP.M. deceived ^ua^ ^e nac*- information that Greece had  been promised by the7-45 P.M.        Central Powers,  &quot;in return for her neutrality, the possession  of              Kavalla and the  islands and the acquisition of the  Dodecanese and              the line from  Doiran to Valona inclusive, Bulgaria  obtaining the              rest of Albania.&quot;                   M. Zaimis  positively declared  that  this information was              fantastic.  He also said  the  story of the King having slated that              when  he was ready he  would  sweep the Allies into the sea was              preposterous.  Not a man in Greece would  raise his hand against              the Allies;  even  those of his  colleagues who were most in favour              of neutrality insisted that it must be benevolent to us.                   216. The  only hope now  seemed  to lie in  an appeal fromAtheus,.No. 1076,  the Government to  the  people, and Sir F. Elliot stated  that  heDes atched       would consult with M. Venizelos as to whether the offer of Cyprus5-15 P.M. Received and the Thracian coast would, if  made public, suffice to override8-45 P.M.         in public opinion the opinion of the  General Staff when that was               also made public.                   Sir F.  Elliot added that  our  tenderness towards  Bulgaria               (alluding presumably  to the Foreign Office  objections to  his               proposed offer of  Thrace) was fatal to any hope of co-operation               from Greece.  The Greek people wanted to  know what they stood               to win, and it was  only at the expense of  Bulgaria that they could               obtain anything  which  they valued.                   He went  on to  point out that we  had  promised  to Bulgaria               what belonged to our friends without waiting for an  offer of active               co-operation, whereas we were now only  proposing to  promise               Greece what belonged to our enemies. Athens, No. 1077,      After  seeing M. Venizeios he telegraphed again in corrobora- Despatched       *i(m of ^s own  v*ew&apos;  &apos;M. Venizelos had advised  that the offer  of 7-45 P.M. Received the coast of Thrace should be  made,  but not until the Allied troops 9-55 P.M.         had arrived in Macedonia in considerable force.  He would prefer               that that should be before the Chamber adjourned in about ten               days, in order that he  might raise the  question, and, if necessary,               upset the Government as a final means of coercing the King.
 .;   Sir E. Elliot said that he  heard from every quarter that the presence of our troops was, what was required, to prove; the sincerity of our intentions..     217.  Other means of bringing military force to bear in order              ( to solve the situation were- being considered..     Sir R. llodd. reported, that the Montenegrin delegate, Radovitch, Rome, No; 1024, had submitted tohim thepossibilityof a considerable forceof the Allies Oct. 20. entering Serbia  through. Montenegro..  A. naval squadron making gSS. Received a. feint at Antivari would enable a, force to land at San Giovanni dl 11-20 p.M. Medua,  whence there is a good road to Scutari thence by lake and good road to the Montenegrin frontier..  He even thought that the tracks from  the  frontier  to  Novibazar were  practicable, for field artillery, and the. road could, be. hastily  improved with Albanian labour.  Supplies would.have to  go to. Mitrovitza, whence, the. roads were good for. motor lorries.     218. Erance had a more serious proposal to make.  At Petrograd Petrograd, the Erench Ambassador,, under instructions, from, his  Government,    15^&apos;(0ct 20, had  been pressing M.. Sazonof to ask the Roumanian Government IQ^PM. to allow the passage of  200,0.00 Russian troops through Roumania, Received&apos;8-55 a.m., for combined, action with, the  Serbian and Allied  forces  in. the. 21st; Balkans. M. Sazonof was quite favourable and had telegraphed the proposal to headquarters.  In reporting this,. Sir. G. Buchanan stated that it would be quite impossible, however, for  the  Chief  of the General  Staff to give effect to it,unless we furnished rifles.                          OCTOBER&apos; 21?.     219. With regard to the offers- to Greece, Petrograd shared the: doubts of our own Ebreign Office.     Sir G. Buchanan reported that M. Sazonof had instructed the Petrograd, Russian  Minister at Athens to join with his colleagues in promising No. 1536, Oct 20. Greece the Bulgarian littoral of  the JEgean, in order to induce her g^p^6-^  -to join us, but had said that he thought we were, making a mistake 9.35^&apos;, 21stin progressively raising  our offers.. He enquired about our offers ofCyprus and Smyrna, adding that in  his opinion these enormousoffers of  territory would lower our prestige, and. create the impres-sion- that, we  were. in. such, desperate straits that we. were ready to.pay any  price for Greek co-operation.  We ought, he said,  in anycase  to fix a term within which Greece must give us a definite reply.     He also reported that the Imperial manifesto declaring war on Petrograd,Bulgaria and the official communique placing the blame on King No. 1538, Oct. 20.Eerdinand had: been published that day.                           Received 11 A.V.    As to Russian co-operation, at Salonica,,the naval attache had plst&quot;been informed that the strength of the Russian expeditionary force No^iSo^Oct 20for action in the  Balkans  was 13,000, and the Ministry of Marine Despatchedwished to be informed when the transports for their conveyance and 8-51 P.M.
