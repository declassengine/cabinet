G.-41COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.The  Military Situation in India and the Middle East.Memorandum by General Sir E. G. Barrow, G.C.B.,         Military Secretary, India Office.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,          November 24, 1915.
THE MILITARY SITUATION  IN INDIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST.     ON the 6th June, by the direction of the Secretary of State for India, I submitteda Memorandum on the &quot; Military situation in India consequent  on  the War.&quot;   Themain object of that Minute was to  give a  general  idea  of the  military situation inIndia, and of the role that India was playing in the Avar.   The situation naturallychanges from day to day, and with the approaching  departure  of the  Indian  ArmyCorps from France, it seems to me that the time has come to review the position afresh,more especially as the trend of events so far as we are concerned, seems to be shiftingthe principal theatre of war to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.     In  my Minute of June last I gave a  brief and  concise narrative of the  militaryevents with  which India was concerned up to the fall of Amara on  the 3rd June.,  Ido not propose to continue the narrative, as  the Secretary of State and presumably allthe present Government are  fully acquainted with all that has since occurred.   It isonly necessary to state, by way of introduction, that by the occupation of Nasiriyeh onthe Euphrates as the goal and reward of a most  arduous  minor operation, and by thebrilliant success we  gained at Kut-el-Amara, we have practically obtained completecontrol of  the Basra Wilayat and all its waterways, thus securing a firm base for ourcontemplated operations against Baghdad.   Those operations have now begun, and wemay daily expect to hear of a big fight at or near Ctesiphon,* which is only 18 milesby road from Baghdad.  If a complete success, as we  may reasonably hope it  may be,General Nixon will probably be in Baghdad within a few days.  He has at his disposalfor  these operations at present  only four  brigades of infantry and one  brigade ofcavalry, viz. :              16 Battalions of infantry.              9 Squadrons of cavalry.             35 Guns.     There is also a small armed river flotilla, including one, or possibly two, gunboats.     The Turks are said to be  sending  strong reinforcements from Aleppo andErzeroum.   These reinforcements are stated to amount to 30,000 men or more, but itis unlikely that this force, whatever  it may be, can arrive on the scene for some weeksin anything like battle formation with guns, munitions, and supplies.   Nevertheless,until our reinforcements from France and  Egypt  begin to  arrive  at  Baghdad, wecannot  be said  to be in a  sound  position free  of  anxiety.   The leading  brigade, orrather five  battalions, should arrive in three or  four weeks, but  I see no prospect ofany more reinforcements reaching Baghdad in 1915 unless we speed  up our transportarrangements,  and therefore, in my opinion, the  position  will be one of some anxietyfrom Christmas till the two Divisions arrive.     In the India Office Minute pressing for the addition of two Divisions, which wasprinted  as a Defence Committee paper, we expressly urged early  reinforcement with aview to the occupation of Baghdad.  If that reinforcement  is  unduly delayed,  thesituation at Baghdad may become unsound in a military sense, but the India Office isnot responsible for any such delay.     I am not in the military secrets  of the Government regarding the strategicalsituation in the Middle East, and therefore I cannot  judge of the relative importanceof the order in which troops should  be despatched to Salonica, or the Dardanelles, orMesopotamia, or elsewhere,  and the delay, for all I know,  may be a military necessity,but  1 am in a  position to state  positively that, if we postpone  unduly  the despatchof troops to Mesopotamia we shall be running grave risks there, risks which will beincreased enormously if we abandon the Dardanelles, or if we meet with a reverse inthe Balkans.   In my  judgment the only  justification for delay is, or can  be,  theintention to force an issue at Gallipoli by pouring in troops there  and  taking the place[1267]* Since this was writ&apos;en the expected battle has taken place.B
at all costs before  tbe  Germans can. establish, themselves  at  Constantinople.   Thatseems to me a justifiable reason, because success at Gallipoli will solve  all otherproblems, Mesopotamia^ Egyptian, Indian, and  Balkan.   All through this  unhappyAvar  we have just failed to win great successes, because we have not exerted  sufficientforce at the critical moment.  The whole essence of war consists in concentrating alleffort at the right time and place.  If Gallipoli is still recognised as our first objective,I admit that any consequent delay in moving the Indian Army Corps must be acceptedas the lesser of two  evils, but, failing  some such supreme reason,  the India Officeought to press on the Government the urgency of the Mesopotamian situation.     If we can concentrate three Divisions, or say 30,000 bayonets  and sabres in theBaghdad area by the early part of January, I believe we can hold our own against anyforce the Turks are likely to  bring  this winter.  General  Nixon  will probably have12,000 men of his  own there ;  4,000 men or so are now en route, the  rest have yet tocome from France.                                       II.     The other theatre of war which most directly concerns India, and that by far themost important, is  the  North-West Frontier of India,  for on the defence  of  thatfrontier largely depends the internal peace of India.  In June last I wrote :  &quot; There is&quot; undoubtedly unrest on the frontier, more  particularly on  the Waziri and  Mohmand&quot; borders.  There are mutterings of &apos; jehad&apos; all along the Afghan marches, and though&quot; the Ameer is believed to be loyal to us, that safeguard depends on his life.   At any&quot; moment he may be assassinated or die a natural death, in which case we may expect&quot; an upheaval in Afghanistan.  If this occurs the whole frontier may be in a blaze, so&quot; that the imperative necessity for a watchful policy and preparation for instant action&quot; is obvious.&quot;     The &quot; blaze&quot; has not yet come, but nevertheless all through  the hot weather wehave been forced to employ mobile columns to guard the frontier at Tank, Miranshah,Kohat-Kurram line,  Adozai, Shabkadr, Abazai, Rustam, Chakdara and  Oghi.  In theaggregate the force  thus mobilised  and in the field under active service conditions isconsiderable.  Ministers may be surprised to  learn that it amounts to :              22 Battalions,             21 Squadrons,              8 Batteries of 48 guns,              2 Sapper companies,             Or in other wrords, the equivalent of two Divisions.*     This, be it remembered, at the worst season of  the year and when we least expecttrouble.  We have known nothing like it since 1897.  Nor has the force  been simplydoing watch and ward.  It has fought  several small actions at Miran Shah, at HafizIvor, at Rustam, and  in the Adinzai Valley.  If the  situation develops as depicted inthe extract quoted  above we shall have to put at least the equivalent of another Divisionof troops on the Derajat-Kohat-Peshawar frontier, and that quite irrespective of thetroops we must maintain  in the  Quetta area.     I  am sure we can do this on our  present resources in India, and also maintaininternal order throughout India and Burma  provided that  the Indian native Army andPolice  remain loyal.  That, however, is a  proviso  for which due allowance must bemade, and though  I  do not wdsh  to cast any  doubts on the loyalty of the Service towhich I belong, I cannot  shut my eyes to facts or to possible tendencies, and therefore,though the Government of India has raised no  express note of warning, 1 feel it myduty to point out that we are getting dangerously near the border- line of  safety.  Imay perhaps, therefore, state in terms of figures how we now stand in India.     According to  the  last Return available  (October 15) we now have in India  justabout 50,000 British troops  instead of the normal 75,000;  164,000 Indian troops,including Reservists  and Recruits., both.with regiments and at dep6ts.     If  to these figures we add the Volunteers on one side and Imperial Service troopson  the other we  get  totals of  98,000 British troops and 17(5,000 Indian troops.In addition to this  there are about 5,000 or  0,000 Gurkhas lent to us  by the  NepaleseDurbar, and for which we are paying.  These Nepalese troops have now had about ayear&apos;s training under British officers, and are  armed like our own sepoys.    *Note. I have not include^ in the above the obligatory garrisons of Peshawar, ]Sowshera, Mardan,Kohat Bannu, and other frontier posts.       [1267]                                                         B 2
    These numbers and proportions are not unsatisfactory if we had only the internalsituation to consider, for  it must be remembered that, on the one side we shall have50 batteries of mobile artillery, and on the other only 6 mountain batteries, and theselatter will be isolated  along the frontier.   Moreover, all the arsenals  and principalmagazines will be in our  hands.   We may also place on the  credit  side the control ofrailways and telegraphs, though this advantage may to a certain extent diminish in thecase of serious internal disturbances.    So far, so good, but  if revolt, or even wide-spread disturbances, synchronize withtrouble  on the  frontier,  or, in other words, if a frontier war  inspired  by &quot;jehad&quot;breaks out, the position will be most grave.    Let me examine this in terms of military units.  We now have in India, includingBurma,  but excluding Aden, Muscat, tbe Gulf ports, Seistan, and Port Blair : 	British.	Indian.Battalions ... ... ... -j-Squadrons Batteries, R.H.A. and R.F.A. ... j Mountain Batteries Heavy Batteries Garrison Companies Sapper Companies Signal Companies	8 Regular Y 32 Territorial j 8 ...... 13 Regular 27 Territorial 6 ... 4 ...... 13	61* , 78 G 1 10 2    The Indian column is exclusive of the depots.   There are about 100 of them, with36,000 men.Of the above we haye at the present moment trans-Indus : 	British.	Indian.Battalions ... ... ... j Squadrons Batteries R.H.A. and R.P.A. ... j Mountain Batteries ... Heavy Batteries ... Garrison Companies Sapper Companies Signal Companies...	7 Regular... 4 Territorial 4 5 Regular ... ... 1 Territorial 4 . .. ... 1 ... 2	37 32 5 1 3 1If to this we are compelled by the force of circumstances to add yet another Division for the defence of the frontier, we shall only have left in all India and Burma: &apos;			British.	Indian.Battalions&apos; Squadrons Batteries RH.A. and R.F.A. Mountain Batteries Heavy Batteries ... Garrison Companies Sapper Companies ...	26 Territorial 4 31 Territorial 2 ... 11	27 28 1 4    That is to say, less than 30,000 British troops for the entire Indian Empire east ofthe Indus at a time when the whole country will probably be seething with excitement anddisaffection.  At such a time the Indian troops maybe a danger rather than a support,so no one can honestly hold that  the position is reasonably secure.  Of course, if theyremain loyal, and if the 17,000 Imperial Service and Nepale%e troops also can be relied
 on, we shall be able to hold our own, but the &quot;if&quot;  is fraught with  such tremendous issues that I doubt if any Government dare take the risk.     Under these circumstances I venture to urge that we cannot well postpone  the despatch to India of reinforcements in the shape of both drafts and units.     The  War  Office have told us that  the  most  they can  send  out  this  cold weather is :                                                                     Men.         Four so-called garrison battalions, or say    ..      ..      ..      ..   4.000         Drafts of recruits for R.H.A. and K.F.A.     ..      ..      ..      ..    566         Drafts of recruits for Territorials    ..     ..      ..      ..      ..    400                       Total    ..    .         .....-      ..   4,966     The garrison battalions will go out unarmed.  They consist mostly of old soldiers unfit for active service, but fit for garrison duty.  On the other  hand the Viceroy has Tel. No. told us that:-                        .                                            H. 8993 of                                                                                  JNov. 7,         &quot; From returns recently  rendered, 359 Regulars and 1,784 Territorials are 1915.     expected  to  proceed  home for  discharge between  the  1st  October  and  the     31st March.&quot;     This  shortage may, however,  be  reduced  by recent orders sanctioning the re- engagement of Territorials for one  year.     Apart from this, apparently, it is estimated by the Indian Government that, failing drafts, there will be a shortage in India on the  31st  March next of  1,730 men, and in Mesopotamia of 2,700 men.  How these figures  are  arrived at is not known here,  but if they are accepted, and if the Territorials  do not  re-engage,  there will  be a iotal shortage of 6,573 against which we may place the 4,966  drafts promised  by the War Office, so that the net shortage may be  taken at  1,607 men, Regulars and Territorials.     As  we must maintain the mobilised troops  in Mesopotamia and on the frontier at their field strengths the whole of this  loss will fall on  the Ois Indus  garrison, andtherefore it may be safely asserted  that we shall not have 30,000 British soldiers east of the Indus.  Under these circumstances  it is submitted that the time has come when Government should  consider whether we  should  not  send out  strong  additionalreinforcements at least 10,000 men during the next few months.   I say  during thenext few months partly because this is the proper and convenient season for reinforce-ments to go to the East, but mainly because if the threatened attack on Egypt developswe may  find risk and difficulty in sending out transports by the Canal  route.  It isnot  necessary  that these reinforcements should be trained troops India can  trainthem but it is necessary that there shpuld be a  constant stream of white soldiersflowing  into India during  the  cold weather, otherwise the idea will spread throughoutIndia that we have come  to the end of our  resources in men.  Such an idea would carry the seeds of grave danger.   We know that similar ideas were spread after the Crimean war, and had an undoubted influence in 1857.   Moreover Mesopotamia  may demand constant drafts, and India  cannot supply them unless herself fed from home.                                                             E.  (.!.  BARROW.
