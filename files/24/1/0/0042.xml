                                   HEADQUARTERS OP THE ARMIES  OP THE EAST,                                              NOVEMBER  1915.MEMORANDUM  FOR&apos; THE  MEETING  OF REPRESENTATIVES  OF THE              -   ALLIED  ARMIES, NOVEMBER  25,  1915.*1. SITUATION ON THE &quot;WESTERN FRONT.    THE Conference of the 7th July, 1915, decided  that  it was  necessary for theallied forces on the Western front&quot; to resume combined offensive operations as soon aspossible.&quot;  In conformity  with this plan, the French  and English Armies took theoffensive as soon as the necessary forces had been organised and collected, and thedetailed preparation  of the attacks had been completely finished.    This preparation took longer than was at first supposed, and the assault, whichhad  been provisionally arranged  for the end of the month  of August,  could not bedelivered in the areas selected for the attack until the 25th September.    The attack  in  Champagne  was  carried out  by  36  Divisions  on a front of30 kilom.;  the attack at Arras by 17 Divisions on a front of 15 kilom. ; the Englishattack by 9 Divisions on  a front of  8 kilom., combined  by  secondary attacks by4 Divisions.    This powerful offensive  achieved  brilliant  tactical results.   The French  andEnglish troops penetrated deeply into the German lines; on the  Champagne front andin Artois they captured about 30,000 prisoners and more than 150 guns.    We have therefore achieved a real victory, the importance of which has  beencertainly appreciated by our  enemies.  They have realised  that  their  lines are notinviolable, and that  the  troops which  they  maintained on our front  were  barelysufficient to prevent our breaking  through;  Without desiring to insist on too close aconnection between  events as they occurred, we may still point out that the checkingof the forward movement of the Austro-Gerraan forces  in Russia coincided  both withthe preparation and with the execution of our offensive.   The Guard, Xth and XVTIthCorps, and the 38th Division of the Xlth Corps were transferred from the Russian frontto the French front during the period of preparation, and made their appearance eitherat the moment of the first attacks  or soon after.!    It is true that the tactical successes gained could not be developed into a strategicsuccess.  The principal causes of  this  were  partly   the  bad  weather  which, byparalysing our artillery, limited our rate of advance during the first days of the attack,and partly by a temporary shortage  of  ammunition   and  of  fresh troops,  whichprevented us from either resuming or prolonging the operations.    A similar effort  to that which we  have just made  cannot be renewed in a briefspace of time.   The attack  of fortified lines such as the  Germans oppose to us requirestoo many men and too much ammunition to  be resumed before the losses sustainedhave been made good and our material resources have been greatly strengthened.    As regards ammunition  in particular, the  September operations have caused  alarge  drain upon our supplies, although these  Were relatively considerable.^:  It isnecessary, therefore,  to reconstitute our supplies and to bring them to a level which,in the next battle,  will relieve   the  higher command from  any anxiety  as  toammunition.    Finally,  in spite of the  progress which we have  achieved, our  equipment  hasstill proved insufficient to meet all the demands which have been made upon it in thespecial  conditions of warfare with which we are  faced.  It is, therefore,  necessaryto improve  and  deArelop  it.  These considerations as a whole make it necessary for usto group our  forces  provisionally in a  state of readiness which will  permit of  a   * This date has since been postponed in order to allow a Russian  representative to attend.   t This movement of German troops towards the French front has  been followed, during- October, by thetransfer of the 4th Division of the Guard, the 1st Guard Reserve Division, and the 4th  Division  of theIlnd Corps, which brings up to 10 the number of the Divisions  recently brought from the Eastern  to theWestern front.   J In the French attacks in Champagne and Artois the expenditure of ammunition, in  round numbers,reached 0,000,000 rounds of field-gun ammunition, and 1,200,000 rounds of heavy ammunition.
 vigorous counter-offensive in the event of attack by the enemy, until such time as we can resume offensive operations on a large scale.     How long that will  be  cannot  be  determined  at  present.   Clearly  it  must depend on the European situation, but it will be wise to reckon  on not less than three months.  At the same time, we  are at once taking all measures to enable us to carry out local or general offensive operations as soon  as the conditions for them are favourable.     The British Armies operating in Erance also require to re-form and rest the troops which have taken part in the attacks, to accumulate supplies  of  ammunition and to perfect their equipment.   Nevertheless, the question of  the  supply of  men  and munitions is not so acute in their case as in the case of the Erench Armies, because of  the reserves  of  men  and  of organised Armies still in England and the possible extension of the manufacturing powers of England which have remained intact  since the commencement of the war.  In spite of this difference  in  favour of the English Armies, it is  clear that it is necessary for them  to conform  their  general  attitude to that of the Erench Armies, since experience has shown that to obtain large results in a theatre of operations such as ours it  is necessary to proceed on a large scale and to employ the whole  available resources.   On the  other hand, as they have larger available reserves, the British Armies should be able to carry out, during the waiting period, operations on a minor ,scale designed to exhaust the enemy and to keep him in a state of uncertainty as to our real plans.  The arrival  of  English reinforcements in France will facilitate the execution of these secondary Operations, and will at the same time permit us to prepare  a larger number of formations for the future combined operations by means of the reliefs which this increase of strengths will  enable us to carry out on a larger scale than before on our front.     The Belgian Army will be able to co-operate in a similar manner. 2.  GENERAL SITUATION IN  OTHER THEATRES OF OPERATIONS.     The following  is  a  brief statement  of the situation  in  other  theatres  of the European war as far as we know it.     Definite information as to these situations should  be presented to the  Conference by  the representatives of the Armies concerned.     On the Eastern front the Bussian Armies have succeeded by a  skilful retreat in avoiding the grasp of the Austro-German Armies in spite of the evident inferiority in which the lack of material resources placed them.  The large forces  which the enemy employed on this side are clearly &quot;incapable of further  effort.  Thanks  to  timely  and vigorous  counter-attacks, the Bussian Armies have even succeeded in regaining certain portions of  the invaded territory and in  re-establishing  their front which  stretches atthe present time roughly in a straight  line from the neighbourhood of Riga to that of Tarnopol.  The Bussian Armies are on the way to complete their supplies of material. Our latest information shows us that they will be sufficiently provided and reorganised to enable them to resume the offensive withiu a  comparatively short period.     On  the Austro-Italian front  the  operations  of our  Allies  have succeeded in occupying  Austrian forces to the  value of about  twenty Divisions.   The  Italian offensive, which  has been methodically carried  out  in  a peculiarly difficult country, entered  upon  a more  active  phase  in the middle of  October. It  is  for  the representative of the Italian Army to inform us as  to the results obtained.     In the Balkans the situation has been profoundly modified in consequence of the entrance  of Bulgaria into the field and the attack on the Northern Serbian front by an Austro-German Army.  The Quadruple Entente immediately decided  to  intervene  on behalf of Serbia to prevent the destruction of our Ally attacked on. two  sides  by superior forces, and  to check the designs of the enemy in the Eastern  Mediterranean.    An Expeditionary Force of 150,000  men (65,000  French and 85,000 English) is now disembarking at Salonica with the object of re-establishing communication with the Serbian Army.   In accordance with the agreement arrived at with the British Government,  the French forces have the duty of connecting with the Serbian Army, while the English contingent hold Salonica and protects the railway from Salonica to Krivolak, both.inclusive.    The  question of Italian participation in these operations and that of opening the line of communication from the Adriatic for the Serbian Army are at present under consideration.     Bussia is concentrating two Army Corps in Bessarabia, and will&apos; form an Expe- ditionary Force  of five Corps as soon as she has received the necessary rifles.  This
 force is intended to operate through Roumania, and  to  draw in by its action the Roumanian Army if it is possible bp do so.     In the Gallipoli Peninsula the situation is stationary, and Cape  Holies  has  been transformed into a veritable fortress, commanding the  entrance  of  tbe Dardanelles. The troops there comprise 11 British Divisions of about 100,000 &quot;men, and a strong Erench Division of about 25,000 men.     In Trans-Caucasia the Russian Army, as  to the composition of which we have no exact  information, has  gained a series of interesting successes and reached the neighbourhood of the Van Lake.     In Mesopotamia the English  forces  (2 Indian Divisions)   have made steady progress in tiie direction of Bagdad by advancing up the  valleys of the Tigris  and Euphrates.   In the former valley they  have  got to within 100 kilom.  of Bagdad. Lastly, the conquest of the German colonies, with the exception of South-East Africa, is practically completed. 3. THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR.     How should the Quadruple Entente deal with the question of  the continuation of the war, in which the situation on  the Western front  has been  described  above in detail, and, as regards the other fronts, in a general manner, subject to revision?     The essential principle to,be  grasped is that decisive results  can only be gained in the principal theatre of operations.     The principal adversaries of the  Central Powers  being England, Erance, Italy, and  Russia, the principal theatre of operations for the two  former Powers is Erance, for the third  is  Austria, and for the last is Russia.   The  Balkan Peninsula, the Caucasus, Asia Minor, &amp;c, are secondary theatres, and the operations conducted there will not decide the war.     Our whole efforts should therefore tend to the resumption of the offensive as soon as possible in our respective theatres,  our maximum resources of all kinds being devoted to that offensive.     Such action as we may take  in  secondary theatres,  however interesting  they may appear, must be taken with prudence  and with  economy of force.  We  must never lose  sight of  the fact that the final  object of the war  is  the  defeat of Austria  and Germany.   We  will now  examine  the  conditions  in  which  it  is possible for the Coalition to  continue the  war in the various theatres in the  light of the  above remarks. (1.)  Principal Theatres of Operations.     We have shown in paragraph 1 of  the present  memorandum  that circumstances require the Eranco-English armies on  the Western front to adopt for the time being a waiting attitude, which will not however interfere with such activity as is required to keep the  enemy on  the  front while  the necessary measures  are  being  taken to enable us to pass rapidly to the offensive.     We have; shown in  paragraph 2 that on  the Eastern front  the Russian armies appear to be in a condition to resume the offensive in a  comparatively short time.   It is  important  that vre should receive definite  information  from  the Russian repre- sentative qn  this point.  It  will then be a question  for  decision  as  to when  the Russian offensive will take place in order that it may be of the greatest advantage to the Quadruple Entente as a whole.     Should it  take  place as,  soon as  possible,  or should  it, on  the other  hand, be postponed  in order that simultaneous efforts may be made  on both the Western andEastern fronts ?  The answer to, this  question  should be the subject of deliberation of the  Conference.  The bases of discussion are the state of readiness of the Russian Armies for a prolonged  effort, the intentions  of the Russian higher Command, the manner on which events  on one front may re-act on the other, the possibility of  the Anglo-Erench Armies advancing the  date on which they will be ready to attack.     Tne Erench  and Russian theatres of operation seem at  first sight to be widely separated.  Yet the enemy does not require more than two or three weeks  to transfer troops from one front to the  other.   Therefore, the operations of the Allied Armies on the two fronts should not, if they are to draw the greatest  advantage from them, be separated by an interval of  more than  two months.     It  must be remembered,  however,  that  tbe Austro-German troops especially dread a second winter campaign in  the severe climate  of Poland and Courland; an
 offensive by our Allies which would draw a large number of troons ill-acclimatised to the conditions on the Russian fronts&quot;&apos;mightcause&apos;rapid&apos;-wasta^df&apos;tlie^iistro-German effectives.,    This consideration may induce the Russian army to take the^offensive- as&apos; sOoh- as- it has.collected the necessary means.    We,are here speaking, of Gourse,.ofoperatidns-on a large scale-:-  TheT&apos;adTa:htages* to be gained by -making the operations-on the&apos; two fronts simul taneous does&apos; ndt make ]oqal:offensiyes,.carried out to.take advantage of a temporary weakening of the endmy&apos;s front, or to keep his forces  occupied, less  valuable.  As  regards the Austro-Italian-&apos; front, the information which we have leads us to suppose that the  Italian Army  will also be obliged to wait for some time before resuming  an  offensive on a large scale,: while still showing such activity as is necessatytd keep occupied during the period of bad weather  the. whole of the  Austrian  forces-by which utis&quot; facedv  The; Italian representatives -are- requested to furnish! information -on this point. (2.-) Secondary Theatres.of Operations; t    Whatever decision may be; arrived at&quot; with  regard  to  the date on which-  the Russian, French; English, and Italian Armies should resume  the offensive on a large scale, some  time  must elapse during which the Quadruple Entente cannot develop its full powers.in the main theatres  of operations.  In  these  circumstances, what action should 5 be taken in the secondary theatres where  the enemy is off eringus battle at certain points ?    (1.) In the Balkan Peninsula-        It is essential that., the programme of action; in  the Balkan  Peninsula, as    defined.above, should be carried out without hesitation.        From the -military  point of view,  it- is advisable to consider whether  the    Allied troops now in:-the  Dardanelles should;-remain there&apos;&quot; or - not;\ or whether a    part should ;be:wdthdrawn.    (2..). Tjwis-Caucasia. and Mesopotamia^        Is&apos;the Army of -Trans- Caucasia in a position to continue its  advance ?  The    Russian representative should clear up this&quot;point:        We  will also ask  the English1 representative&apos; to tell us the possible develop-&apos;    ments and the intentions of  the British Government in Mesopotamia.                                *    (3.) German Colonies.        It, would bef of interest to^ complete the-conquest;of German colonies.&apos;&quot;  As    regards, the Cameroons, the, operations are approaching- completion.  The&apos; question -    of German East Africa remains to be considered. .. It&apos;would-be of interest to-know&quot;    the intentions of England and Belgium.in this theatrel -    (4.) Access to the Mahommedan World.        The  Quadruple Entente has the--greatest interest in shutting  off the  Central    Empires  from access  to  the Mahommedan world which  peoples its colonies.    If&apos;    the operations in  the Balkans  are&apos; completely&quot; successful  this  result will  be    attained.-- In the contrary-case, if the Austro-Germans succeed in establishing a    direct  touch with  Constantinople, it  may be  necessary to bar their  further    progress.   What are the views of the Allied Powers on this question ?    To sum up, it wrould seem that the line of conduct of &quot;the Coalition shouldr be -asfollows :     (1.) Erance,  England, Russia, and Italy will, make every effort to  resume&apos;  theoffensive as soon as possible  on their  respective fronts, but with  all necessary means-for this.    The object of-the Conference is to determine &quot;how best Our  efforts in  a  generaloffensive can  be co-ordinated.    The decisions arrived, at as to the general&quot; conduct Of the&apos; warwill not, of course,prevent the a Commanders-in-chief from- engaging - in: local&quot; actions of greater or lessimportance, with the object-of taking advantage of temporary &quot;weakness of the enemyor of keeping  on  their fronts  as largess possible a number of the-enemy-srtroops.  -      [1235]  &apos;                   ^                                        C  ;
         Pending the proposed general offensive:      (2.) Prance, England, Italy, and Russia will  carry out their programme in the Balkans^ on the lines laid down.   &apos;  (3.) Italy, Russia, and England will continue the operations now in progress on the Italian front, in the Caucasus, and in Mesopotamia, in such manner as the season and  the facilities for communication and local conditions admit.  Further      (4) France,  England, and  Belgium  will continue  the   conquest  of  German colonies. 4. THE HIGHER DIRECTION OF THE  WAR.     Under existing conditions,  co-ordination of  the  efforts  of  the Allied Powers should  be attained from a military point of view if the programme agreed upon  by the Commander-in-chief is carried out punctually, but that co-ordination depends at present upon no  alteration  in  our  combinations being necessitated by  the  enemy&apos;s initiative.   Now,  in order that we  may not be taken by surprise,  the  Allies must provide for eventualities, that is to say, they must forsee possible action by the enemy and  study beforehand  the measures  which  it may be necessary to take in order to oppose his designs.     It must be recognised that up to the present the Powers of the Quadruple Entente have not carried out this preliminary study  in common.  For example, the German attack on Serbia has caused  us  to  come to decisions  under the pressure of events because  we  had not considered  this  eventuality  in time.  It is indispensable that a method  of conducting  operations which  is so prejudicial to our general interests should  be changed.  The understanding between  the  Powers must include every sphere  of activity, military, naval, financial, economic and industrial.  It is true that it is not the duty of the Commanders-in-chief of the Allied Armies to study all these problems.   They  should confine themselves  to  a common study of  such military problems as may arise, consider the most appropriate solutions, and present them for the  approval of their respective Governments.  For example, the Balkan problen, which may, according to circumstances, develop in a variety of ways, should be studied in common from day to  day.   It is necessary  to consider how  the military action of Roumania and Greece should be  guided if they come in  on  our  side,  to examine the measures to be taken if one or other of  these Powers declares against us,&apos; determine our line of conduct if. Germany becomes  mistress  of Constantinople and  pushes the Turks against the Caucasus or towards Egypt.     Again, it is necessary to consider the  dispositions required if Germany violates the neutrality of Holland or of Switzerland, or if Sweden intervenes in the conflict.     The existing  organisation, which  consists  of periodical meetings, interchange of telegrams or of liaison officers, does not permit the Commanders-in-chief to arrive at a general agreement on  all these questions.   It should be  possible  to create for  this purpose a permanent organisation  at the headquarters  of  one of  the armies of the Quadruple Entente, which should include an accredited representative of each of the Allied Armies.*     The body  so  organised should examine, on the initiative of its President, all problems with which the Coalition may be faced, and should communicate the reports or proposals drawn up in common to the respective Commanders-in-chief by  telegram or liaison officer.  On the basis  of  these reports,  Commanders-in-chief should address their proposals to  their respective Governments and prepare the action agreed upon by the Coalition. 5. PROCEEDINGS OF THE  CONFERENCE.    The following points should first of all be established :    &apos; (a.) The  representative  of the  English Army  should inform  the  Conferenceas to      (1.)
