November 1915.SECRET.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Report on  Experiments  to employ Hydraulic  Jets for the                  Attack of Trenches.Report by Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,           November 9, 1915.
REPORT ON EXPERIMENTS  WITH  MONITORS  OR  HYDRAULIC  JETS                 FOL1 THE  DESTRUCTION OF TRENCHES.                          The Object of the Experiments.     THE object of the experiments was to test the effect of hydraulic jets upon field defences, and to estimate their effects on the personnel holding such defences.     The  experiments   were carried  out on  Saturday,  the   6th  November,  at Kinlochleven, N.B., by means of the plant of the power-house of the British Aluminium Company&apos;s works.  The head of water employed was about 820 feet, and from one of the  large service  mains in use  for  power, the water was  taken at  a pressure  of approximately 400 lbs. per square inch, and projected through nozzles designed for the purpose for which the tests were being made.                              The Targets Attacked.     2. At  distances of 100 and  150 yards from  the  nozzle were lines of trench.es constructed to represent some of the German works in Flanders.   Each line consisted of 100 feet length of trench with overhead cover  of earth and three layers of sand-bags over a very strong timber framework, and 100 feet of open trench revetted with sand- bags and brushwood hurdles, and having a flat low parapet composed entirely of sand- bao-s.                          The Nature of the Experiments.     3. Tbe first trial was with a 3-inch nozzle against the trench 100 yards away.  The effect of this was  found  to be fair, but  in view of the superior results to be expected from the use of a 4-inch nozzle the experiment was not continued.     The second  trial  was with  a 4-inch nozzle with the same  head of water, andconsequently a slightly reduced pressure.     The third trial was with a 4-inch nozzle of a different pattern with the same headof water, and with the same reduction of pressure.               v                                  t                          The Residts of the Experiments.     4. Since the results attained by the 4-inch jets were so much better than given bytbe 3-inch jet,  those for the former only are here described.  Without giving the detailof the various  periods for which  the  water was allowed to  play on the targets, thefollowing seem to be the useful conclusions drawn:          4-mc/i jet at 130 yards range.    (a)  The jet had very little effect on the materiel of the trench at this range, though          it would have had considerable effect in preventing the men holding that          trench from using their weapons.         4:-inch jet at 100 yards range.    (6)  The jet with nozzles of both types was very efficacious against the trench, but          its  effect against the  personnel would have been far greater than it  was          against the materiel.  From what  was seen  it is estimated that at this          range one such jet, if traversed along the target at a rate of about 100 yards          in  three minutes, could  by the force of the water, liquid mud, and stones          thrown, temporarily put out of action the defenders.      [1208]               &quot;                                           B
               This would be the case even when the jet actually hit the ground some           10 yards short of the parapet, since  the water, soil, and stones are hurled           up with such force that they would put out of action anyone standing up in           the open at a distance of 30 yards beyond the trench.   In other words, no           man 40 yards behind the point of its impact with the ground could face the           action of the jet.               Even men in the  100-yards length of trench, whether open cr furnished           with overhead  cover, would  in  this  two minutes have been temporarily           disabled by the water blast and  shower of mud projected with great force.           Rifles and machine-guns would become coated with mud and clogged, and           would be unusable for some time.               Where the jet hit sand-bags full,  it lifted them some 12 feet in the air           and flung them back, burst, about.30 feet away.    (c.) If the jet were to be more slowly traversed from one  end of the 100  yards           trench  to the other, so as to cover the LOO yards length in twelve minutes,           care being exercised to direct the water directly on the trench,  it  seems           that most of those men who had been temporarily incapacitated or blinded           by tKe  previous rapid  application of the water would  be put  out of action,           killed, or drowned.  It would seem impossible, even if they were not  killed           by receiving the full  force of the water on their bodies, that they would           be able to breathe in the partial vacuum caused underneath the parapet, or           the super-saturated  atmosphere above it.    A  machine-gun in the  open           would be at once overturned if the jet fell full on it, and even if within an           emplacement  behind an armoured  shield it would be put out of action, and           rendered useless in half a minute if the jet were directed against the shield.    (d.) From the effect produced on a wire fence, it does  seem that an  entanglement           would be damaged.    (e.) Any dug-outs leading off the length  of trench  attacked would be rendered           untenable, and when the jet could be directed on the entrance, egress would           be made almost impossible.    (/.) The net result of this is that if such a jet could be put into operation without           interruption  by the enemy it could in three minutes temporarily put out of           action the defenders of 100 yards of an enemy&apos;s trench at any distance up           to 100  yards from  the jet, and could,  within  fifteen minutes  of first           application, permanently put out of  action or drive away the defenders  of           that length.    (g.) In the experiments which were tried against short lengths of trenches some           of the  latter were filled to the brim with  water, but this is no gauge of the           amount of water that woulcf remain in the trenches in actual practice, which           would  depend on the  nature of the  soil, the  lie of the ground, and the           length of the trench attacked.    (h.) The muddy condition of the trenches assailed and the water  in them would j           certainly be a drawback to their Occupation by the  attackers, but, if the           position was one which it was very important to gain, this drawback would           not be  sufficient to prevent the attacking  infantry rushing forward and           occupying the vacated works, even though half full of water.                                 Tactical Points.    5. The water  jet itself,  and the cloud of mud and vapour thrown up are veryvisible, and it is thought that any attack made by water should be carried  out at night;an observer, connected by telephone-with the operator of the jet, directing  the operationfrom a point at least 100 yards to one flank of the nozzle.   Electric  light projectilesshould be used for illumination, also placed to one  flank.   If the attack is attempted  inthe daylight,  it is thought that with an enemy as efficient  and watchful as the Germansthere  would be such a concentration of machine-gun and artillery fire upon the point fromAvhich the  water was seen to spring,  that the nozzle would very quickly be damagedand the attackers&apos; works flooded.   Whether it  would be the case on  the  GallipoliPeninsula,  where  the number  of guns possessed by the Turks and  the  method  ofhandling the guns is not so perfect, is  open to doubt.    6. To assist in such an attack at night, also, it is thought that the nozzles should beconcealed in deep  emplacements behind the attackers&apos; trench and  that  he should be       [1208]                                                          B  2
misled by means of searchlight projectors placed at several points, by means of smokescreens, and possibly by means of flame throwers and bonfires in different directions.     7. Several nozzles should be in a position ready for use before the attack is opened,so that one could be used after  the  other, as the occasion demanded.   The  operationcould be repeated as an advance was made if  spare  lengths  of  pipes were to hand toprolong the main for use further ahead.                                Engineering Points.     8. It was gathered that the pressure at which the jet was worked at Kinlochleven,i.e., somewhat less than 400 lbs. to the  square inch,  though not  beyond  the bounds ofpossibility even in the Gallipoli  Peninsula, was somewhat greater than that which couldbe  conveniently  arranged,  150 lbs. to  the square inch, bearing in mind the dispro-portionate increase in horse-power and weight of steel water mains  which are entailedby increased pressure.     9. For the Gallipoli Peninsula the  scheme as at present  tentatively contemplatedis as  follows:  The  height  at which the  water  must be  delivered is  taken asapproximately 800 feet above sea level,  the distance  from the intake, i.e., the sea-shore,2,000 yards,  and  the pressure at nozzle  150 lbs. per square inch.  This work will entail3,000 horse-power.   To provide, this,  a  steamer containing the necessary boiler  powerwill be moored at a greater or less distance, according to circumstances, from the shore.Fitted in this  steamer &quot;will  be  a steam turbine  and a  dynamo.  The current will becarried to the  shore by a  cable, and will there actuate an electrically-driven turbo-pump which  will  draw water from the  sea and force it up part of the 800 feet lift.Here a second turbo-pump, also electrically driven, will force the water up the remainderof the distance and give it the required residual pressure of 150 lbs. per square inch atthe nozzle.     Though the exjDeriments were made with  water at  a pressure at the nozzle of400 lbs., it is thought that by using a nozzle of more suitable design and throwing thejet at a higher trajectory as good if not better effects may be  obtained with a pressureof 150 lbs.                                    Conclusions.     10.  The experiments so  far tried show  that the employment  of  water jets mayenable a  small stretch of the  enemy&apos;s front,  which it has  been  impossible to gainotherwise, to be won within a few minutes, and that, from an engineering point of view,it is possible to provide these jets.     Whether the expense and the trouble of installing  such  a scheme  are prohibitiveor not cannot yet be settled without further  experiment.                                 Recommendation.     11.  It is recommended that the Inventions  Department of the Munitions Ministrybe requested to conduct a further  experiment of the same nature as that already tried,with a specially designed jet of 5 inches diameter,  working at a pressure of 150 lbs.per square inch; that meanwdiile engineering details and the approximate  cost shouldbe worked out for a scheme based  upon  the  following data, which  it is believed  willfulfil the conditions at  Anzac, and therefore those  in  any other theatre  of war wdierethe ground is flatter :      (a.)  Height of delivery above intake 800 feet;     (6.)  Pressure at nozzle 150  lbs. per square inch ;     (c.)  Length  of main 2,500  yards, i.e., from intake to jet  (500  yards to  allow for           deviations and slopes;  and     (d.) Length  of cable 300 yards, in  case the vessel can lie  in  dead  water close to           shore, and  as an alternative 3,000 yards, in  case the vessel has to lie some           distance off the land.     12.  It is understood that the chief  difficulties anticipated in  the actual installationof such a system, lie in the provision of  the electric cable and of the steel mains.     13.  It is suggested that, in  order to let the Military Authorities on the spot knowof what is under  contemplation, a copy of this  report should  be at once  sent to the
Cornmander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, for his opinion.   He may beable to ascertain the exact localities where attack by water&apos;can best be employed andto report on the possibility of mooring a power-vessel close in shore, or the reverse, andon other points which will be of assistance to those  working out the scheme  at home.Brigadier-General A. C. Joly de Lotbiniere, C.S.I., C.I.E., R.E., now at Gallipoli, is  anacknowledged expert on hydraulic power  schemes, and upon the  information conve)redin this report  and from his technical experience and knowledge of the locality shouldbe able to give valuable data and information as to the engineering difficulties likely tobe encountered.
