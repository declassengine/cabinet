August 30, 1915.
                    PART I.-THE TACTICAL  PROBLEM.    THE tactical situation on the Gallipoli Peninsula  is as follows:  There are twodistinct theatres of operations, viz., the southern theatre at  the toe  of the peninsula,and  the  northern theatre at  Anzac, which has recently been extended northwardsacross the Suvla plain to the ridge of hills running parallel to and close to the Gulf  ofXeros in  an&quot; easterly direction from Suvla point.                         Southern Theatre of Operations.    2.  In the southern  theatre of operations the deadlock is just as complete as it isalong the whole  of the front  in France  and  Flanders.  Both  sides are thoroughlyentrenched with  the  usual  elaborate system  of fire  and  communication  trenches,dug-outs,  barbed  wire, machine-gun  emplacements,  saps, mines, &amp;c.  In places thetrenches are not more than 15 yards apart, and probably nowhere are  they  separatedby much more than 300 yards.  Continuous and active trench warfare is carried on byboth sides. The Allies have  the advantage of more artillery and more ammunition,and are better provided with such accessories as trench mortars and  sand-bags, buteven after the most elaborate artillery preparation they are unable to make any seriousadvance.   Here and there, it is true, they take a trench  at considerable cost, but asoften as not they  are driven  out  of it the same night.  The  Turks have  plenty ofmachine guns, and use them  well; their snipers are as  good as ours ;  and they arepast-masters in the art of bomb warfare.   Even after the  terrific artillery preparationof the 6th August, when a large quantity  of ammunition, including much high-explo-sive shell; was expended, even though it was supported by heavy fire from the men-of-war, including the 14-inch guns of the Monitors ; even though it was assisted by everymodern accessory aeroplanes and  balloon-ships on   front and   flank; and  eventhough the observers  reported it  to be  the most  successful  bombardment  we  hadcarried out-notwithstanding  this, and notwithstanding that the Turkish  artillery wassoon silenced and was never effective,  the Allies  failed to obtain any substantialadvantage.  Krithia is  still almost 1,000 yards from the nearest trenches, and  AchiBaba still provides an ideal observation post from which the Avhole of  our position corps and divisional headquarters, reserves, rest camps, base lines, artillery positions,communications,   beaches,  and anchorages can be overlooked, and  artillery  firedirected.   From the Asiatic shore cross observation can be made and cross fire broughtto bear into the flank and  rear of our position,  though latterly two Monitors at RabbitIsland and some heavy French howitzers at De Tott&apos;s battery have succeeded in limitingthe activities  of  the  Asiatic batteries.  On the whole, however, the  advantages ofthe Allies in material are outweighed by the advantages of  the enemy in position.    3.  The situation  in this  southern area is  thoroughly uncomfortable, and mightbecome untenable if the Turks had a large supply of ammunition, but, as things are,it can be held.  Considerable  daily wastage is  inevitable, and a very high morale andelan is hardly to be expected from troops who have been  continually subjected for longperiods to such trying conditions, and have besides been fighting for many months onthe offensive.  From this, and as an  inevitable result of the heavy losses incurred inthe recent  fighting, it  follows that for the present at  any rate aU expectation of adecisive victory in this  theatre has  been  abandoned, and  the plan of capturing  AcidBaba and mounting heavy guns and howitzers behind it to shell the forts and  clear theway for a naval advance up the Straits is in abeyance,      [.973]                                                             B
Northern Theatre of Operations.     4.  In the northern theatre of operations  the  deadlock is less complete.  It is true that before the Gth August both sides  were, and for weeks had remained, entrenched almost  more elaborately than at Cape Helles.  On the night of  the 6th-7th, however, our force there surprised the Turks, captured many lines  of trenches and redoubts with double rows of barbed wire, with the result that they trebled the area occupied, effected a junction  with the troops  newly landed to the northward^ and gained the position on the ridge, their main objective,  both at Koja Chemen Tepe and Chunuk Bair.  The  former position  was held only for a short time  owiug to the accidental bursting  of  some  shells from  our  own Monitors  among Indian  troops,  who HAD fought splendidly, but lost  heavily.   The Chunttk Bair ridge was held for three days by the New  Zealanders who had  captured  it,  but was  subsequently  lost  by two battalions of the XIHth  Division, who relieved them, and were attacked by the enemy in  huge masses; great  slaughter AVAS  inflicted on  the enemy,  but, overwhelmed by superior numbers, our troops were driven a short distance down  the ridge, AVHERE they are entrenched and hold  their own.     5.  While on the  ridge enough  was seen from both points  to demonstrate the importance  of  occupying it, for the  whole of the country up to  and across the Straits could be viewed.   In our  hands the ridge  would  provide an  artillery observation station from which  the enemy&apos;s  communications,  both  from Bulair by land  and from Asia Minor  across  the Straits could be  most seriously menaced by artillery fire, and it. would form a splendid starting point for a further advance  against the enemy&apos;s line of  communication  and retreat.   Conversely,  while it remains in the enemy&apos;s hands it forms a second and superior Achi  Baba.  From this ridge the enemy can not only direct  his artillery against  nearly every part of the Anzac position, including all the piers except one recently constructed, which  up  to the 19th August had  remained unmolested, and snipe parts of  the  beaches  with  machine-gun and rifle fire, but he can also direct  fire against the  ships and beaches in Suvla Bay and observe  all that is taking place in  this district.   Koja Chemen Tepe and Gaba Tepe occupy a  tactical position in  the  northern area at least equivalent to that of Achi Baba and the Asiatic shore in the southern.  Here also, if  the enemy had a  larger  supply of  ammunition, our  position could  be rendered untenable,  and our  advantages  in material  AND personnel (for Anzac  has  a  marked  advantage  over the  enemy  in  personnel) are cancelled out by the enemy&apos;s advantages in position.     G. On the Gth  and 7th  August, while Anzac was extending its  position as already shown, a new landing was  taking place to the northward at  Suvla  Bay  and south of Nibrunesi Point.  The intention, and indeed the paramount necessity, was to surprise the Turks, and pushing  on  to seize  the range of  hills at the back of the bay roughly north and south through  Anafarta Sagir.  Although in a strategical sense the surprise was complete, the troops failed  to push on for reasons which  have been  explained in Sir Ian Hamilton&apos;s telegraphic reports.  The result was that, instead of occupying the ridges, the troops  were held up in the  middle of the flat plain at the back of Suvla Bay, on a line roughly north and south through a point some 3,000 yards  from the head of the bay.  This  position  was practically unaltered a fortnight after the original landing, for, in  spite of several attempted  but half-hearted attacks in force greatly superior to the enemy, the troops had barely held their own.    7. Since that date  another attack has been made, but apparently without achieving any permanent improvement in our position.    8. The  importance of obtaining the Anafarta  Sagir ridge is very obvious.   In ourhands, considered particularly in  conjunction with Koja Chemen Tepe, these hills form an  excellent  point of  assembly for  a further  advance  on  the  enemy&apos;s  lines of communication, and  probably a  good artillery  observation  station for harassing the enemy&apos;s communications; they also  enable us  to  screen the  lauding  place at SuvlaBay from artillery  fire.  Conversely, in the enemy&apos;s hands they provide observationstations commanding Suvla Bay, the Nibrunesi landing-places, and the whole of the fiatplain where our troops are entrenched.  The deep ravines and gorges, which intersectthe ridge, and the narrow gap between the Anafarta ridge and the Sari Bair range also
64provide concealed artillery positions and rallying places for the concentration of troopsto attack our position.    9. The importance, then, of Sari Bair and the Anafarta ridges must be consideredtogether.  Either of them in our hands constitutes  a serious menace to the veryexistence of the Turkish army in the southern area.  Either of them in the enemy&apos;shands is a danger to ITS, for  it enables him to harass our communications to an extentonly limited  by the quantity of artillery ammunition available, and exposes us to theconstant threat of a surprise attack.                         Prospects in the Northern Area.    10. At present both these vitally important tactical positions remain in the enemy&apos;shands.  What prospect is there of wresting them from him ?   It seems not unlikelythat the Sari  Bair ridges may be recaptured.   The previous surprise attack was  soadmirably conceived and dashingly executed that it inspires the utmost confidence bothin  the  General,  the   staff,  and  the  troops.   The  losses  were very  heavy, thedisorganisation and  mixing up of units great,  and  the  exhaustion  of  the  troopsconsiderable, and the further attack is not likely to  succeed until  drafts  have beenincorporated and reorganisation completed.   The morale of the troops, however, highas it  was before the battle, has been raised by their success.   Men have been heard tooffer 51.  to  their  comrades for a place  in the front trenches !   It  is unlikely that we shall again be driven out by sheer weight  of numbers.  Our failure on the lastoccasion was due to the difficulties  attendant on  the organisation of a proper  defencewith disorganised  units, exhausted by protracted fighting in difficult country, witha long and new line of communication to  establish up steep and trackless slopes.  Onthe next occasion we shall start from a few  yards below the crest.   On  the whole,therefore, there is good ground for  hoping for another success in the Anzac region.    11. At Suvla the prospects are far less  bright.   It is  too much  to  expect thattroops  who  have  completely failed  to  achieve  success  when  pitted   against  anunentrenched rearguard probably not  exceeding  as many battalions as they themselveshad brigades,  will be  more fortunate when  the  enemy  has had  time to bring upreinforcements and artillery and to dig himself in.    It is true that the previous attackfollowed close on a  night landing, where the units had  become mixed up, and thetroops  somewhat bewildered and  exhausted  by the  novelty  of  the  operation, andharassed by their first,  experience  of  shrapnel fire ;  it is  true that  the local staffarrangements and the  leadership were  defective;  it  is  true that new generals  ofproved capacity have been substituted, and that a powerful artillery has been landed;it is true that a converging fire will be brought to  bear on  the enemy from  Anzac,Nibrunesi, Suvla Bay, and Suvla hills, and from ships at and  beyond Ejelmer Bay inshort,  from front, flank, and rear and that elaborate arrangements have  been madefor the proper observation and direction of the  fire;  it is also  true that  the troopshave been  reinforced by  a  brigade of the redoubtable XXIXth Division from thesouthern theatre, and by General Paton&apos;s yeomanry division from Egypt.  Notwith-standing all these changes in the conditions, it must be doubted whether the ridges willbe won, and it seems more  probable that the history of the attacks on Achi Baba willreproduce itself at Anafarta ridge and on Suvla plain. *                              The Tactical Outlook.    12.  To sum up, the most reasonable expectations as  regards the purely tacticalprospects are  that we  shall be able to hold on to our position in the southern areawithout  achieving  a  substantial advance;  that  at Anzac  we  have a  really goodprospect of gaining a footing on the Sari Bair ridges, from which we shall be ablealmost immediately to  harass the enemy&apos;s communications,  and  before long  toorganise a further  advance ; and  finally,  that at Suvla we  are  unlikely to achieveany considerable success, and may  find ourselves  obliged to hold on in a position ofsome difficulty.   * The failure of the local attacks which have taken place at Suvla since this  was written confirm theseimpressions.  On the other hand, the success of the recent minor attacks at Anzac  give ground for hope thatwhen the big attack is made on the.ridges it will succeed.      [973]                 &quot;                                            C
     13. Thus it seems unlikely that an early and complete success can he looked for.We have to envisage the fact that before  decisive results  can  be looked for certaintactical positions have to be won, which can only be  secured at  great cost.  &apos; If finalsuccess is to be achieved, we must make  preparations to make good the losses, andto reinforce the troops at Anzac and Suvla, in order that they may follow up theirsuccesses ;  and at the same time we have to enable the troops to  maintain themselvesin the positions they have won in both the northern and southern areas under weatherconditions far less  favourable  than those  which have hitherto prevailed.   This willcall for still greater efforts, the nature of which  will now be examined.   PART II-THE  MEANS  NECESSARY FOR A CONTINUANCE  OF THE                                  CAMPAIGN.    14. Of the two requirements, the offensive and the defensive, the former is by farthe more immediately important.  If a successful offensive can be maintained there isa decent chance that the  campaign in the  Dardanelles may be  successfully concludedthis autumn.                                     Drafts.    15. One  important requirement is drafts to replace casualties.  The  average lossin an offensive action, such as that of  the Gth August, is  25 per cent,  of  the infantryengaged.  In some units it is much greater, and in others much less,  but ^5 per cent.is rather below the average.   Under the normal system it takes a few days to ascertainwhat the losses are in fact, this is not accurately known  until it  has  passed throughwhat is known as the &quot; third echelon &quot; at Alexandria a fortnight  after the event these losses then have to  be telegraphed to England, and probably,  owing to shippingand other difficulties, six  weeks from the date of  the action elapse  before all the draftsare received  ; by this time still further  casualties  have  been sustained.  The netresult  is  that,  even before  a  great attack such as that of the (Jth  August, theunits  are below  establishment,  and  after  the  attack  their  strength, is so reducedthat they are  immobilised for offensive purposes for some considerable time.  So muchwas this felt that, in the case  of  the recent landing at Suvla and Nibrunesi, the newbattalions were deliberately put  into  the  line at 75 per cent, of their establishment,the remaining 25  per cent,  being  kept back for incorporation after the  battle asdrafts.    16. As  a policy of perfection our aim  should be not only to make good all pastcasualties,  but  also to  supply  in  advance 25  per  cent,  of drafts  for  anticipatedlosses,  but it  is understood that lack of shipping and other considerations render thisimpossible.   The  greatest possible  effort in  the replacement of losses is speciallyimportant, because in this matter the  Turks,  being close to their base, have  a greatadvantage over us, and latterly their casualties have been made good in three or four-days, even if  by inadequately trained raw material.                                  Ammunition.    17. The  second  requirement  is  an ample supply  of  ammunition,  but it isunnecessary to  dwell on this,  It is fully recognised  at  the  Dardanelles  that theirdemands for ammunition have been met in the most generous possible manner.    18. A point of  detail which may perhaps be mentioned here is that good restdtswould probably follow if the fleet at the Dardanelles, and particularly the Monitors and&quot;-bulged ships &quot; and destroyers, would  be supplied with a considerable proportion ofshrapnel for guns of all  calibres.  Such, at any rate, is the view of the Royal Artilleryauthorities, and, so far as is known, the Navy is not disposed to dispute it.    19. It should be noted that without  regular and ample supplies of ammunition itmaybe impossible to.follow up a success and convert it into an overwhelming victory.
                                        o                                 Reinforcements.     90. The third requirement  is for reinforcements, and this is  perhaps as much adefensive as an offensive need.  There is no suggestion that the force supplied for therecent offensive operation was   insufficient  in numbers.  It was quality and notquantity that was lacking.  Five brigades were held up probably by a less number ofbattalions; and there is no reason to suppose that any excess of men, unless composedof experienced troops; would have made up for the deficient military qualities.     21. The position, however, has now changed considerably since the  first landing.The extent of the position in the  northern area from the sea on the  north to the southof Anzac is little less than 18,000 yards long,  and the number  of  divisions  available isbarely eight.  In the southern  area  a position nearly 6,0o0 yards long  is held byrather less than six divisions.     22. It will be seen from this rough calculation that the  number of troops  in thenorthern area for the  double operation of holding  in  some parts and  taking theoffensive in others is relatively small.   Yet  it  is difficult to reduce the length of the line.To abandon any part of Anzac would be to  surrender to the enemy positions  fromwhich they would overlook and enfilade us.  To abandon  Suvla Bay would be to giveup landing-places which may be regarded as indispensable if the campaign is prolongedinto the winter.  If it were practicable, it might be preferable to abandon the southernand concentrate all our forces in the northern area, but this is  on all hands agreed tolie a  tactical operation of great  difficulty,  entailing very heavy losses in  men,  guns,munitions, stores, and morale.  Moreover, this course would result in a correspondingwithdrawal of  Turks, and the hope we have at present of cutting  off the Turkish armyin the southern area could not be realised if we ceased to contain it there.   The enemy,it is true, has not an army of  unlimited  size in the Gallipoli Peninsula, and, havingregard to his preoccupations elsewhere, and to the ever-increasing  harassment of hiscommunications by our submarines, and latterly by our seaplanes, it is doubtful if hecan increase his forces very much.   The  extension of his line  must put him  in aposition of  great difficulty, more particularly since the offensive has now definitelypassed to the Allies.  In fact,  the solution  of the question depends on wdiich side candevelop a successful offensive.  If the Turks can do it we shall be driven into the sea,and our army will suffer a  disaster almost  unparalleled in the history of the Britishrace.  If wre can do it the Turks  will find themselves in a similar position.  The fateof two Empires hangs on the possession of  two  or three miles of territory.    23.  Given drafts, ammunition, and the reinforcements for  which Sir Ian Hamiltonasks,  there  is no doubt  that  we have a  reasonable prospect of achieving success.Throughout this  campaign the Turks have attacked  again  and again with  the utmostbravery and vigour;  but, though often successful in local counter-attacks,  they  haveno considerable victory to their credit.  The Allies, on the other haud, have gained atotal of 6,500 yards at Cape Helles, have won many tactical victories, and have usuallysucceeded in carrying successfully the object of their attack.   An equal advance fromAnzac would secure Boghali and  Mai Tepe,  and  would place  the whole of the Turkishcommunications at our mercy.  Half an equal advance from our present positions atSuvla would secure the  Anafarta ridges, and (more particularly  in  conjunction  withthe capture  of the Sari  Bair ridge) w^ould  go far to render  Suvla  free  from seriousmolestation.    24.  It would be a mistake to be  disheartened by the comparative failure of thenew troops in the Suvla landing.  Many of the troops on the peninsula, who have sinceshown sterling qualities, acquitted themselves poorly  at first.  i  25.  In  short, the only chance of bringing this campaign to a successful conclusiontms autumn is to continue a vigorous offensive, and for this  it is  necessary to senddrafts in anticipation  of requirements, to continue to send ample supplies of ammuni-tion, and to furnish reinforcements.                 The Need of Preparation for a Winter Campaign.    26.  Nevertheless, having regard to our previous experience of warfare of  thiskind, and the slow rate of  advance possible in trench warfare-and  at  Suvla the-
position is rapidly  approaching trench warfare, even  if that stage has not definitelybeen reached-it would be highly dangerous to gamble on the likelihood of an earlysuccess, and it is necessary to contemplate the possibility of a winter compaign.   Thisbrings ns  face to face with the administrative difficulties involved.    27. In making our administrative  plans it  is  necessary  to assume  the  worstreasonably probable  conditions, viz., that the  situation  remains stationary  at Helles,Anzac, and Suvla.   Better conditions, it is hoped,  will supervene,  but it would not  beprudent to reckon  on this as certain.   The arrangements for  the  contingency of awinter compaign are  in course of  active preparation by the  D.Q.M.G. in  consultationwith the Navy, and the necessary demands will no  doubt shortly be put forward, wherethis has not already been done.  All that it is proposed to attempt here, therefore, isto sketch  some of  the difficulties that will  have to be faced, and some of the stepswhich will probably be required.                          Preparations in the Trenches.    28. In most parts of the peninsula there is a tendency for the  soil to hold water-even  on the heights of Anzac.   Careful drainage will therefore be necessary.   AtAnzac and Helles, where the land  lies high,  there ought to be no great difficulty aboutthis.   At  Suvla, however, if  our troops do not succeed in reaching at least the lowerslopes of the Anafarta ridges, the position will probably resemble that  of  the trenchesin the low-lying districts of Flanders.  Already in summer it is found that the trenchescannot be dug deep in the plain without filling with water, and once the autumn rainsset in this difficulty will be accentuated, and breastworks may have to be substitutedfor trenches.     29. The communication trenches also will become soppy, and probably planks andhurdle work will be required to ensure rapid communication.                              Roads and Traviways.     30. The roads by which the  communication  trenches are approached,  sometimes(at Helles) leading through  deep and winding nullahs, the bottoms of which may  beexpected at times to become rushing torrents, will require close attention.   These roadsare for the most part incompletely metalled ; and tracks which  in summer providegood  going may in winter be wellnigh impassable unless carefully prepared.  In thesouthern  theatre it is understood that the difficulty is to be got over by the employmentof tramway and railway material.     31. At Anzac, where the roads are in some places sunk deep in communicationtrenches and in others lead  up steep slopes, the position will be particularly difficult.The sunken roads may be expected to become quagmires and the steep slopes slippery,whether  for man  or  mule.   It seems  desirable,  as  soon as possible, to relieve thesituation  by the construction of aerial cable haulage, such as is constantly met with in aprimitive form in the mountains of North Italy, and is to be seen in a more elaborateform at Gibraltar.  It is  odd, indeed, that  this very obvious method of transport hasnot already been adopted at  Anzac, as it would relieve the heavy fatigue duties  whichhave so taxed the strength of this  command.   One difficulty is the comparative isolation of and lack of communication between the  upland  portions of  this extraordinary district, which necessitates the provision of  a large number of cables.      32. At Suvla it  should  be  possible to establish  road or railway communicationbetween the shore  and the communication trenches, but it is rather early to express a definite opinion on this.      It is probable also that Suvla  Bay will be connected with Anzac by  a railway or tramway running  along the shore, in order that Anzac may be supplied from that relatively sheltered anchorage when bad weather puts its own piers out of action.                            Accommodation for Reserves.      33. Another point which will require careful  consideration  will be the provision of accommodation for the reserves, who live at present in  &quot; dug-outs &quot; behind the line
for protection against  shell fire.  At  Anzac the  existing  dug-outs should  remainhabitable, as they are mainly clotted on the steep slopes of the ravines.  At Suvla  alsoit&apos;may be&apos;found possible to accommodate the reserves  on the hill-sides.   But in thesouthern area it seems probable that the existing  reserve  dug-outs, which consist msome parts of holes in the ground, will become mere  tanks  of  water, and that someother  system will be necessary.   Huts would be too conspicuous, and it may benecessary, to solve the problem by cutting out caves in  the cliffs or in the  sides of thenullahs, if this is practicable.                           Heating and Warm Clothing.    34. During  January and February, when  snow and really cold weather  may beexpected, some&apos;form of heating for dug-outs and trenches will be essential, as  well asthe provision of warm clothing.                           Cleanliness and Recreation.35,        Sea bathing, the  one recreation of  the  men, will before long become im-practicable.  The problem of keeping the men clean will then present  difficulties, andsome  system of baths will become an indispensable. necessity in all  parts of thepeninsula where troops are located.    30. It will also become necessary to provide some form of recreation to compensatefor the loss of sea bathing if the men are to be kept in good fettle.  There is no doubtthat the absence of anything in the nature of a canteen  is already keenly felt, moreparticularly by the Australians and New Zealanders, who have a good deal of money tospend.  &quot; I don&apos;t want to talk about this  campaign,&quot; a  private was heard to  say, &quot; Iwant to go somewhere where I can  spend  a bob  now  and  then.&quot;  This observationillustrates a real want.   In every  part  of the peninsula, as well as on the islands, itwould be a boon if canteens could be established where the men. could buy such thingsas sweets,  cakes,  potted  and tinned meats,  sardines,  pickles, writing paper andenvelopes (very important), toilet  paper, tobacco, &amp;c, and  a few recreation  tents (suchas are supplied in France  by the Y.M.C.A.) would  be most welcome, if they could besecured against shelling.   All these things are needed now, and their provision wouldbe good business.  In winter they will become even more  urgently required.4                                     Water.    37. The  one unmixed  advantage which winter is  likely to bring will be  thesolution of  the  water problem.   Throughout the  summer months the  naval andmilitary officers  in  command have had no greater preoccupation than the supply ofwater to the army ashore.  Even in the Helles area, where a good many springs werediscovered, it  has been found necessary to  land 300  tons a day.   At  Anzac  theproblem was  one of great insistence, for  not  only was  very little water  found,necessitating  the carriage by sea and landing under  shell fire of nearly every dropconsumed, but for a long time it had to be conveyed by hand to the heights above.   Itis only recently that a pump (apparently rather an ineificient one !) has been installed,which raises the  water direct to reservoirs in the hills, and the system of  distributionis perhaps still rather in embryo.  The seriousness of the problem may be gauged fromthe fact that a  few clays before the battle  of the 6th August General Birdwood wascompelled to suggest the possible evacuation,  or partial evacuation, of the  position forthe lack of water.  When the extent of the position was  trebled, and water had  to beconveyed up trackless ravines to a greatly increased number  of troops, some  of whomare now entrenched  some  800 feet  above  the  sea, the difficulties  assumed  greatproportions, and  it is a tribute to those concerned  that the supplies of water, food, andammunition were successfully maintained mainly by the use of mules, though thistended to complicate the problem by increasing the amount of water and  forage thathad to be  landed.  Already some  water  has been  found in the extension of Anzacterritory, though it tends to dry up quickly, and it is hoped to carry on until the rainsrelieve the situation.    *  Since this was written a telegram has been received to the effect that canteens have been establishedat Helles and Anzac.  They will, however, need extension to Suvla and the  Islands.       L^j                                                             D*
    38. At Suvla also water has proved, and  still proves, a difficulty.  Inland  on theplain  there is plenty of water to be obtained by sinking wells, but on the  beach thereis  none.   The failure of the troops to push inland after landing on the Gth Augustplaced a great strain on the resources at the beach.  It is said that men mad withthirst deserted the firing line to return to the beach and fill their water-bottles, onlyto drain them dry before getting back, and distressing stories have  been told oi thesufferings of wounded  men from  thirst.  This was  certainly one  of the principalsecondary factors  to  account for  the failure of this  great  opportunity.   At Suvla,however,  the water  situation,  if  not  entirely satisfactory,  is  improving.   In  theneighbourhood  of the troops on the plain there is ample  water.   On  the  hills ofKiretch Tepe Sirt, and at the beaches, water-borne supplies  are still necessary.  Aslate as the  18th August, however, no reservoirs were  seen, except  a few canvas  andmetal tanks improvised by the Navy at the original landing.    39. A great strain was thrown on the naval authorities by the non-arrival of tankvessels, which  they  had expected would arrive from England in August, and, owingto the loss of tank vessels by shell fire, a certain amount of improvisation had to beresorted to in the supply of water.    40. As already mentioned, however, the  water problem  should  be solved by theadvent of  winter, when there is far more likely to be too much than too little.                                    Supplies.    41. The discussion of the water  question, however, brings us straight to theheart of  the  vital problem which confronts us, viz., is it possible to supply our armieson the peninsula in late  autumn  and winter,  when  frequent  north-easterly gales,accompanied by a good deal of sea and swell, varied by occasional south-westerlygales, must be anticipated ?.  1    42. Until the failure of  the surprise  attack at Suvla was definitely recognised, sogreat were the hopes  aroused by  this  plan  that it was difficult to  get either navalor military officers to discuss the  prospects   and  possibilities of a winter campaign.Latterly,  however, both the Vice-Admiral,  the  G-.O.C.-in-C, the  C.G.S., and  theD.Q.M.G.  expressed  the  general opinion that it should be possible to maintain  ourarmies on the peninsula in winter.   Tt would not, howTever, be fair to pin them downto this until their  examination of  the  question  is complete.   Nevertheless, somestatement of  the difficulties involved may be useful.    43. These difficulties arise originally from the fact that all the daily requirementsof the army munitions, food, forage, most of the water (up to the  present), and  fuel have to be brought in by sea, as the portion  of the peninsula in our occupationproduces practically nothing of use for man or beast.     44.  Even when the large transports could lie off the  peninsula and  dischargetheir cargoes straight ashore the problem was sufficiently complicated.  But with theadvent of the submarine   this became impossible, and it was  only the  fortunatecircumstance that considerable numbers of destroyers  and trawlers were available(the latter  having  been sent  out primarily for mine-sweeping)  which  averted  acatastrophe.   Since this  occurred the large men-of-war and transports have remainedin the more or less secure harbours of Mudros (inLemnos Island), Kephalos, and morerecently Suvla Bay, and have discharged their cargoes  into small craft for conveyanceto the peninsula.     As these harbours occupy a very important  position in  the system of supply,  ashort description of them and the landing-places in the peninsula may be useful.                                     Muclros.     45.  Mudros has from the first been and  remains the principal advanced  base of these operations, where most of the large warships arid transports lie.  The harbour is protected  by two anti-submarine nets&quot;and some light guns, searchlights, submarines, and patrols.   A heavy net  has been supplied, but  it has not yet been found possible
 to lay It out owing to  technical difficulties.   It is a large harbour  affording safe anchorage in all iveather, though in heavy gales trans-shipment may be interrupted for a short time.                                    Kephalos.     40. Kephalos, which  is the headquarters  of  the G.O.C.-in-C, and  the normal anchorage of the flagship (&quot;&apos; Triad&quot;),  was originally used as an advanced base, mainly for the supply of water to Anzac and frozen meat both to  the northern and southern areas.  Since&apos;the arrival of the reinforcements for the battle of the 6th August and the occupation  of Suvla Bay  it  has obtained enhanced  importance,  and  has  gained a position almost comparable with that  of  Lemnos.  Most  of the monitors, bulged cruisers, seaplane ships, kite balloon ships, and other vessels for the artillery support of the  army both in the northern  and  southern  areas  lie there, and it  has  not been unusual for large transports containing water, mules, and even troops and ammunition for Suvla Bay to be sent there, in order to be at hand, if required, at short  notice.     47.  The objections to Kephalos are  that  it is  not very  strongly defended, and is entirely open to  the  north-east wind, which  sometimes renders trans-shipment and even movement within the harbour impossible.  In-winter it is  to be feared that this will often be the case.  Even during  the operations  of the  Gth  August the  hospital ships were obliged to go round to the  other  side  of  the  island in  order to render trans-shipment  of  wounded possible.   Some ships, however, have been sunk  on the west side of the bay  to form a breakwater, which provides some shelter for  lightersand smaller craft.     48. The defences consist of an  anti-submarine net,  without a gate, but  with  a large overlap between the two portions, and of  indicator nets  run out into  deep water for a distance of some miles on  either  side of the ba)^.  Men-of-war are relied  on entirely for  gun  defence, and the &quot; Exmouth &quot;  (usually between two  colliers) and  a French torpedo-proof battleship, as well as several monitors and cruisers are generally in harbour.                                    Siivla Bay.     49. During the recent operations  in the northern area,  Suvla Bay was at first used by large men-of-war  and transports, an anti-submarine net being drawn across the bay for their security.  Owing, however, to the failure of our troops to occupy the  Anafarta and Sari Bair ridges, artillery was soon brought to bear on the bay.   First field-gun fire drove the ships, including even the battleship &quot; Triumph,&quot; to  the very edge of the &quot; net, and a few days later (.1.0th August) a 4-inch and  heavy howitzer fire had succeeded in driving many transports by day out of  the bay to  seek refuge in Kephalos.     50 When Suvla Bay was selected as a. landing-place it was hoped to find there an anchorage for large vessels, and to create facilities which would enable it to be used in almost all weathers.   It was hoped  by  connecting  it to Anzac  by rail to make up lor, or  at any rate to  supplement, the inadequate landing facilities there.  The failure to gain the ridges has largely defeated these hopes.  Ships at Suvla are between the devil (as represented  by the  guns ashore if  they entered the bay) and the deep blue sea with its submarines, which have already  found the bay and attacked balloon ships there, though fortunately without success.  By day, at any  rate, large ships run great risks inside the  bay, though they might go in by  night, if it  was thought worth while.             &apos;             ...           &apos;    51. At Suvla, therefore, until the ridges are won, as at Anzac and Cape  Helles, we/ are faced with the probability that the work  of  disembarking  stores, &amp;c, will have to be performed mainly at night and by small craft, trans-shipping at Mudros, for it is doubtful whether Kephalos will be a practicable trans-shipment harbour in winter, whenthe north-east gales set in.   m 52. The  contingency has therefore to be  faced  that both at Helles and Anzacperiods of days,  and even weeks, may elapse when  it will  be impossible to  land orembark anything at all.
                        Landing Places in the Southern Area.     53.  In the southern area several ships have been sunk at.&quot; W &quot; beach (Lancashire landing)  and a pier has  been run out alongside  them.   Similarly at &quot;V&quot; beach (Sedd-el-Babr  Bay) the  &quot;River  Clyde,&quot; with a  pier  alongside, provides  landing facilities.  It is hoped that these ships will afford sufficient shelter for disembarkation purposes in a north-east wind, though they are entirely exposed in a south-west wind, and it is understood they are to be filled with sand to increase their durability.  They are, however, in the nature of an experiment, and it remains to  be  seen whether they will not break up in really heavy weather, sweeping with them the piers, or whether, even if they remain in place, they will afford sufficient lee in a heavy swell to render landing operations possible.     54.  The- obvious prophylactic is to build up as large a reserve as possible at Cape Helles.  Before the  operations  of the 6th  August it  is  understood  that  on one occasion the reserve had reached  a month&apos;s supplies of food, but had never exceeded a week&apos;s supply of forage.  Ammunition, of course, depends on the rate of expenditure, and it will evidently be the aim of the  Turks to attack with the object  of making us expend our reserves when bad weather sets in.     55. A minor, but not inconsiderable, difficulty at Cape  Helles will be the evacua- tion of the sick and wounded,  which is, under normal circumstances, carried out daily. If communication is interrupted and heavy fighting takes place  there will be  uncom- fortably large accumulations in the clearing stations, wdiich will  have to be enlarged.     56.  The moment a spell of fine weather supervenes there will be a rush to make good the drain on  reserves and  to evacuate the hospitals, and the success of these efforts will depend upon the small craft available and the  extent to which the landing facilities remain unimpaired.  Here again the Turks will find good opportunities for shelling the beaches.     57. The difficulties of  maintaining the army in the southern area would be much reduced if Morto Bay could be used, as it is  completely sheltered from  the north-east and partially from the south-west.  The Asiatic batteries, however, have  rendered it altogether untenable for the present.  This is the reason why the French  General and his  Staff are perpetually harping upon  the  desirability of a landing on the Asiatic shore.   If  unlimited troops were available  this would undoubtedly be  desirable, in view of the possibility of a winter campaign, but in existing  circumstances  it appears impossible.                       Landing Places in the Northern Area.     58. At Anzac, before the landing at Suvla Bay, the position  in winter threatened to be very precarious.  For not only was there every probability of all communication with the shore being cut off, but it was feared that  at times the  sea might become so heavy as to wash away the piers and damage the piles of stores on the narrow beach.     59. It is hoped,  however, that, provided the position at Suvla can be maintained, it will  be possible to victual Anzac from Suvla.  As already mentioned, it is proposed to run  a narrow-gauge tramway, and eventually a motor railway from Suvla to Anzac. Until it can be protected by earthworks it will be liable to shelling and  sniping, but should be sufficiently safe by night.     60. At Suvla itself piers have been constructed  in two coves  on the north side of the bay, where  complete shelter is obtainable in north-east winds.   Their principal objection  is  that reefs jutting from the  land  and covered by water  restrict the approaches, and may prove  inconvenient in a swell.-  A landing pier is also proposedfor the south side of the bay, where there is deep water, and it is hoped to find shelter from south-west winds in cover  not shown on the map.  The possibility of utilising some small sandy coves north-east  of Suvla Point in south-westerly winds is also under consideration.  South of Nibrunesi Point the coast is  steep^to^, and provides admirablelanding facilities in fine weather, well sheltered from the north-east, but the swell will
perhaps render  these  impracticable, even in north-easterly  gales, and there is noprotection from  the south-west.   These landing-places, like those at Suvla Bay, areexposed to shell fire.    61. Although, the question was still under investigation at the time of my departure,the general opinion  of experts  seemed to be that the  occupation of Suvla  Bay,  ifproperly followed up, would go far towards solving our difficulties in the  northern areain the event of a winter campaign.    62. The policy of  the G.O.0.-in-C. was understood to be to build up reserveseverywhere  for  a minimum of  thirty days&apos; supply, to  be raised,  if  possible, toforty-five clays.    63. If  the large transports continue to be shelled out of Suvla Bay the  difficultiesof this will be greatly accentuated, for the duty, not only of maintaining the considerableforces in this area, but also of building up the initial reserve, will fall  on the smallcraft, and this  difficulty will be still further increased whenever offensive  operationsare undertaken,  for  this throws  much additional work on to  the small  craft  bothimmediately before the attack in the  accumulation of reserves of ammunition  and inthe transport of troops, and  after the attack  in the removal of wounded.  In fact,  ifthe reserve  supplies are to  be properly built up,  it would  seem almost  indispensablethat (if the enemy permits) there should in all areas be a period of quiescence beforewinter sets in.    64. It is impossible to read the foregoing remarks without realising the importanceof pushing out ample reserves of ammunition and supplies of all kinds  in order thatthey may be landed as  soon  as  possible,  and proper  reserves of munitions, supplies,forage, ordnance  stores, engineer stores, &amp;c, built up ashore.  No complaint, however,was heard as to the punctuality of the arrival of supplies, though of course  all  armieslike to  have  as large a reserve of ammunition as possible.                                Ships for Sinking.    65. It  is also desirable that, if any old vessels are available for sinking,  theyshould be sent  out, as  more ships are needed at Suvla and  Kephalos to provide a  lee.Any men-of-war or other ships suitable for this purpose  that are  earmarked for the&quot; scrap heap &quot; would be warmly welcomed by the  Vice-Admiral.                                  Small Craft.    66. The main requirement, however, which perhaps transcends all others is smallcraft-z.e., small cargo steamers,  tugs, trawlers, motor-lighters, picket boats,  seaworthylighters, and motor-boats.  It is  to  be feared that the wear and tear on this kind ofcraft may  be very great indeed in the winter months.   Even  at the present time,whenever there is a moderately strong north-easterly gale, the  shore at Kephalos isstrewn with lighters, and a proportion of  them cannot be salved.   Similarly the wearand tear at the beaches on the peninsula is considerable, both from gunfire and badweather, and salving  under fire  is  very difficult.  Wrecks are  to be seen at  all thebeaches.    67. The Vice -Admiral is understood to consider that his immediate  requirementsin small craft will be  met when  those  already on their way have arrived, and it isbelieved that these will suffice even if the reinforcements asked for by the G.O.C.-in-C.are given.  ^ But the  Admiralty must be prepared  for further demands to replacelosses,  and  it is  suggested that these, if  available, should be sent to the  station inadvance, and before the winter gales render their transport  difficult.                                 Floating Dock.    68. Another urgent requirement is a floating dock to take destroyers;  and thevice-Admiral/lays great stress  on this, having failed to  obtain one on the station.  It      [973]                               &quot;                             E
is impossible to overrate tbeworkof the destroyers, which have been veritable &quot;maidsof all work,&quot; being  employed indifferently  in anti-submarine work,  patrol,  mine-sweeping,  transport of  troops, supplies and water, artillery support  to the  troops,reconnaissance, despatch carrying, and many other duties.   They have  stood the testsplendidly, and it is remarkable how high a proportion is maintained at a time fit forservice.  &quot;With the prospect, however, of a winter campaign, the provision of a floatingdock is very important, if their efficiency is to be maintained as it must be.     69.  A dry dock capable of accommodating destroyers would also be available  forthe ketches.4  The duties carried out by ketches are as important as those of destroyers.They have been employed on nearly all the same services as destroyers, and, in addition,are utilised for laying, maintaining, and  towing the indicator nets, and  for blockadeand anti-submarine patrol work.  They are  based in the port of Kondria in LemnosIsland (next to Mudros), and  have  hitherto  been looked after, as  regards repairs, &amp;c,mainly by the &quot;Isis.&quot;  They are under the immediate orders of  Captain  Heneage,R.N., on the &quot;Hussar.&apos;&apos;&quot;  The indicator net  depot is the  old  castle  at Tenedos, whereit is looked after by a R.N.R. officer who has some hired Greek refugee labourers to assisthim.   The supply of nets and floats  is  amply sufficient at present, and in  excess ofthe number which the drifters can cope with.     70.  If these  vessels are to be maintained in an efficient state, as is highly desirableunless  a much  larger  number are to be supplied,  the provision of a  dry, clockis important.                                     Hulks.     71.  Another urgent desideratum for a winter campaign is the  provision of hulksfor use in Mudros and perhaps in Kephalos.  At present,  when a transport arrivesat Mudros, eveiy endeavour is made to unload her as rapidly as possible and to despatchher contents to its destination.   It sometimes  occurs, however,  that a  portion  of thecargo cannot be utilised at once, and when this portion happens to be on the top (as issometimes unavoidable, particularly  when  the  ship is  sent direct from England toMudros without being rearranged at the  depot at Alexandria) it is very awkward to getat the cargo underneath, which may be urgently required. For example, a case (merelyan everyday one) came under  notice where some engineer  stores (picks, shovels, &amp;c),-which were urgently required, were buried among amass of mining timber, which at thetime could not be be utilised ; there was nowhere to put the latter, which eventually hadto be pitched into the harbour and tied into  rafts to await the time when they would berequired.  A much more extreme incident occurred some weeks ago, when some storesurgently required in the peninsula were found to be underneath some railway trucks  ;there was nowhere to deposit the latter, and eventually the ship was taken to sea  andthe trucks were dropped into deep water !     72.  As Mudros does not  lend itself to  the construction of deep-wrater quays on alarge scale, or piers of such size  that bulky stores could be accommodated on them,and as Alexandria is rather far off to ensure the final rearrangement of cargoes beingcorrect (besides which in times of pressure ships do not invariably call at Alexandria),it would be a great economy if hulks or large barges, or perhaps  landing stages suchas are used at Liverpool or even  on  the Thames, could  be sent  out  to  serve  asdumping spaces or warehouses for stores that cannot immediately be utilised.     73. There is another reason for doing this,  especially in winter.   As alreadymentioned, there may be long periods when the peninsula  cannot  be  regularlysupplied.  Unless the  transports can be unloaded into hulks, &amp;c,  they wiU perforcehave to stay-in Mudros until the advent of  better weather  renders it possible for thesmall craft to discharge to  the peninsula, and the lock-up of shipping will be worsethan ever.  As it is, good seagoing transports such  as  the &quot; Arragon,&quot; &quot; Minnetonka,&quot;a ship allotted to one of the  seaplane ships, and possibly other ships are locked updoing nothing but indispensable depot duties, which seems almost an outrage with thepresent  shortage of shipping.  Both economy and  efficiency,  and perhaps  actualnecessity,  therefore demand  the supply  of hulks or landing stages for  a  wintercampaign, if it is possible to procure them.    * Ketch is a generic term employed at the Dardanelles to indicate either a trawler or a drifter, the moretechnical term only being employed when a ship of that particular class is referred to.
                                   Motor Boats.     74.  Mention must also be made of the urgent need for  sea-going motor boatsfor use in the  harbours.  As the  Admiralty have been fully  informed as  to  thevital urgency of this, it is not proposed to traverse the ground again here.                                    Packing.     *     75.  One point to which  attention may perhaps  be drawn here (though it isnot a &quot;requirement&quot;  to be supplied  for  a winter campaign) is the need for verycareful packing at  home.  In all  parts  of the  command instances were  given ofwaste of energy due  to  faulty packing, e.g.,  a machine  would arrive  without  thebolts  and nuts  required to  piece  it together.   In  no  branch  was  this  moreconspicuous than in the aeroplane service.                                    Aircraft.    7fi. It is not proposed to discuss the aerial services here at any length.  They arein a STATE of  reorganisation  by Colonel Sykes, who has only recently taken up  hisduties, and every confidence  is felt in the future.  A great many new machines  arebeing provided, and the great defect of  the past, viz., the multiplicity of types (elevendifferent types were seen in twenty-five machines), is being corrected as far as possible.The  unsatisfactory  aerodrome at Tenedos, which  was  altogether too remote fromG.H.Q., is being left to the French,  who have an admirable and well-equipped  servicethere, forming a contrast not flattering to our own.   Already the British aerial servicesare in course of concentration at Kephalos, which, though  not an ideal place (at presentnone exists) is preferable to Tenedos.    77. The main need  of the  aerial  service  is more  aeroplane pilots.   Those  atpresent available have, many of them, been continuously employed since the beginningof the  operations at the Dardanelles and  before that  in Flanders, and are very wornout.  Several  have  done an average  of over  200 hours in the air at the Dardanellesalone.  Some have sustained accidents, with the result that they cannot fly at all.    78.  Apart from pilots, motor-boats are the main  requirement.  At present if anaeroplane  falls  into the  sea it often cannot be salved,  merely for want of a fairly fastmotor-boat.    79.  The seaplanes had  proved rather a disappointment up to quite recently, asthey could not fly  high enough, owing to the weight of their floats, to reconnoitre or&quot; spot &quot; for artillery over the land Avithout being Avithin eifective range of  the enemy&apos;sGUNS and rifles.  The recent exploit, HOAVEVER, of torpedoing  ships in the Dardanellesand Marmora has aroused great enthusiasm, and the possibility is being discussed ofmounting machine-guns in seaplanes to enable them to emulate and  supplement theexploits of the submarines by holding up and sinking the caiques,  AVHICH avoid thesubmarines by hugging the coast in shallow water.  Colonel Sykes  is fully alive tothese  possibilities, and he has among  the  sea-pianists  some very enterprising andintrepid officers, who only ask for opportunity to undertake any risk.    80. The balloon ships are a great asset, and are the pet aversion of the enemy, AVIIOceases FIRE the  moment they ascend (sometimes with &quot; dummy &quot; men !), and they arethe continual object of his attacks by gunfire, aeroplane, and submarine.   It would beAS Avell to anticipate some losses and be  ready to replace them.    81. One  airship had been landed  by  the 19th August, and the  construction of ashed was AVELL advanced, but no flights had  taken place.  Some doubts are entertainedas to the probable utility of these airships so late in the season, owing to the suddennesswith.which squalls are wont to arise.                    Summary of Administrative Requirements.    82. To sum up, then, i  the Dardanelles operations  are to be pushed to a successfulconclusion, TAVO main  heads of policy must be  adopted  to guide our administrative      [973]                       *                                     ^
preparations.  Firstly, preparation must be made for a sustained and vigorous offensivein the early future, and  this necessitates the provision of drafts and ammunition inadvance of requirements, as well as.reinforcements on a generous scale.   And secondly,the possibility  of a winter campaign must be faced, and this will probably involve theprovision  of heating  appliances for the trenches,  improved  roads,  tramways, andrailways, and probably aerial cable tramways at Anzac, warm clothing, batbs, canteens,large supplies in advance of requirements in order that reserves may be built up in thepeninsula, enlarged hospital accommodation  in the peninsula, condemned men-of-warand  other vessels to be sunk  as  breakwaters, small cargo steamers,  tugs, trawlers,motor lighters, picket  boats, ordinary lighters  and motor-boats in advance of require--ments to replace casualties  (N.B. A certain number of tugs and lighters are beingtaken up at the Pirasus); a floating dock for destroyers and trawlers, hulks or  laudingstages to  act as  dumping places for gear which cannot be landed at once, and, inaddition, there  will be ever-increasing demands for Greek and Egyptian labour.   Forthe aircraft service  more aeroplane pilots and motor-boats must be  supplied,  andadditional balloon ships should be got ready.    83. Notwithstanding the enormous administrative difficulties  of a winter campaignit is not too much, to hope that they will be successfully surmounted if all demands arepromptly  met, and, so far as  possible, prepared for  in advance at home.  Admittedlythe dangers of the situation  are very considerable, but much is to be hoped from thosewho have already surmounted such overwhelming obstacles.            PART  III. THE  CONDITION OF THE RIVAL ARMIES.     84. The tactical situation  and  the  administrative needs  of the army for acontinuance of the campaign have now been explained.  Before discussing the futurepolicy of this campaign it may be useful to pass some comments on the fighting valueof the Allied and Turkish armies.     85. If the Intelligence Department reports are to be believed, the morale of  theTurkish troops should be very low.  In regard  to  the  strength  of  the forces to beencountered, their  distribution, the number of guns, and  the  defensive preparations,the intelligence  service has been, on the whole, satisfactory.  But on  the question ofthe morale of the enemy&apos;s troops it has  been misleading,  though not necessarilyinaccurate.  There is evidence of the best kind prisoners caj)tured, orders, diaries, &amp;c,which have proved accurate in most questions of fact that the Turkish troops are  nowcomposed of second-rate material; the territorial system of recruiting  has ceased toapply, and the prisoners in one captured regiment were found to  be drawn from allparts of Turkey;  officers are rarely captured, which  tends  to confirm  the prisoners&apos;accounts that they disappear before an action, and trained  officers are known to bescarce;  the men are warned that they will be fired on  if they evacuate their trenchesor try to surrender, and this has been known to  occur.  The physique of prisonerstaken lately is below that of earlier days;  untrained and  half trained  men are oftenbrought into the ranks ; prisoners are  contented after capture, and  unwilling to return ;the war is unpopular, and our submarine officers have boarded a hospital ship and drunkdamnation to the Germans with the Turkish officers ; service  in the Gallipoli Peninsulais notoriously unpopular, and the losses have been tremendously  heavy. Perhaps inthese circumstances  the  Intelligence Department  hardly deserves  censure if itanticipated an enfeebled resistance to our last onslaught.    86. Nevertheless, the incontestable fact remains that the Turkish troops are not inthe least demoralised, and in the recent actions  have fought as they never fought before.Not only did they defend themselves bravely, but their counter-attacks were delivered\yith the utmost vigour and were often crowned with success.  Except at Anzac, wherethey are completely dominated, they hold  their own in  everyday  trench warfare,  andthey are particularly proficient in warfare with  hand grenades.    87. As already mentioned, drafts  are furnished regularly and  absorbed quickly.The troops are  very  fairly equipped (boots  are rather a weak point), well  led,and, so far, sufficiently supplied, the monotony  of their service  rations being  eked  outwith dainties supplied by some patriotic.society.  Like ourselves, they have their water
difficulties.   There is no evidence of serious sickness among them.   They appear  topossess unlimited supplies of small-arms ammunition, judged by the reckless prodigalitywith which they blaze  it away at night, though their orders often warn them to bemore sparing.  In fact, the one indication  of shaky morale is their &quot; jumpiness&quot; afterdark.   They are  not exactly lavish in their expenditure of gun  ammunition, but theyappear to have ample supplies for field-guns.  There are  signs  that the heavier gunsare running  rather  short  of  ammunition, and most  of  the recent  long-distanceshelling has  been with high - velocity naval  (4&apos;1-inch)  guns.    Recently also alarge  proportion of their shells  have failed to  burst.  They  rarely  waste ammuni-tion,  and  only  fire  at obvious  targets,  but   these are  so  numerous  as  to  bepositively disconcerting to the enemy gunner, owing to the  commanding positionsoccupied.   During three  weeks&apos;  stay  no single  instance occurred of a  Turkishartillery preparation  for an attack on a scale comparable with that  adopted by theGermans. French, or ourselves.  Yet there was a continuous and  discriminating fireevery clay that is^ rather harassing, if not very deadly.    88. The Turks fight absolutely straight, and give and take hard knocks withoutdescending to the abominable methods of the Germans.  Poison gas and poison bombsare conspicuous by their absence.  Hospitals and hospital ships (which lie comparativelyclose in shore) have been respected, and, so far  as our  submarines have been able toascertain, the Turkish hospital ships have been used only for their legitimate  purpose.There is a certain respect, and almost liking, in all ranks of  the British army for theiropponents, which is believed to be reciprocated, and the bitterness and hatred for theenemy so often met with in France is not conspicuous.    Si). On the whole,  then, the Turk must be taken very seriously as a fighting-man.    90. The  British,  troops vary considerably.   The Australians and  New Zealandershave  a splendid morale,  and their  discipline,  if unorthodox, appears to  producesatisfactory results.  &quot; Their&apos;s not to reason why, their&apos;s but to do  or  die&quot; has noplace in their military system.   The Australasian troops  are perpetually discussing thesituation in all its bearings, and  like to know the reasons for  operations before theyundertake them.   Their recent successes  are the best  guarantee of  their efficiency.Their health is satisfactory on  the whole, but in Egypt last winter  they were found  tolie rather susceptible to pulmonary complaints, and this  causes  some  apprehension asto their health in the severe winter which  sometimes  sets in in the- north-east emMediterranean.   They consume very large quantities of drugs, and go sick for  rathertrivial causes.  Their principal needs are rest,  canteens, and recreation.    91. The troops in the southern area consist mainly, of divisions which have becomeacclimatised and inured to  the hard conditions of this war.  Some, notably the NavalDivision, are  very exhausted, and have  not much fight  left in  them, unless  they arethoroughly  rested  and  refitted.  Others, however,  and  notably  the redoubtableXXIXth Division, even though tired, are still full of fight.  Latterly very little progresshas been made by the Allies in this section, and not much is to be expected, at any rate,not until the battalions are completed up to full strength.    92. The French  troops are kept better up to strength than the British, and are inevery way well found.  Their aerodrome, for example, compares most  favourably withours.   They have a rest camp at  Tenedos, and there is  a  regular turnover of theirtroops, just as is aimed at in the case of our own troops in the  rest camps at Lemnosand Ivephalos.     93. Ihe newly arrived British troops have varied very much in quality, and it isperhaps too early to pass judgment on them.   The XIHth Division, which was the firstto arrive, and spent some time in the trenches, performed most brilliantly on theGth August.  The  Xlth Division, which  arrived second, and part of which was tried inthe trenches, and the whole of which was  exercised as a  division  at  Lemnos, foughtcreditably.   The  Xth Division, one brigade of  which  was detached to Anzac, andwhich had no opportunity before the action to exercise together, did not distinguishitself.   And the  LUIrd  (Territorial  Welsh)  Division,  landed   straight  from&quot; thetransports, failed altogether.   Thus  the military qualities shown  by the troops werein  direct   proportion  to  their  opportunities  tor obtaining  local  knowledge and
experience, and  justify the policy always  insisted on both by Sir John French andSir lan Hamilton, when opportunity offers, to accustom the troops gradually to lightingconditions.     94. It would be difficult to exaggerate how much the  efficiency of a unit dependson its commander.   Again  and again  this has  been demonstrated in the peninsula,and  the success of the Australasians must be  largly attributed  to  their  admirableleaders.   A policy of ruthless  weeding-out of  inefficient commanding officers woulclprobably be fully justified in the result if more efficient officers  could be found totake their place.  Warfare at the Dardanelles requires exceptional  stamina and nerve,qualities  which are  most likely to be found in  young  men.  It is better to employmen who have reputations to make than those who have  reputations to lose.  Sir IanHamilton has  called for the names of Lieutenant-Colonels  and even Majors who arerecommended for service as Brigadiers, and it is to be hoped  that  this policy willproduce good results.  The difficulty is that so  many of  the most promising youngofficers  are killed or wounded.  Even  Brigadiers  sustain heavy casualties no  lessthan five were placed liors cle combat during my stay of three wreeks.     95.  The  D.M.S. described the health of the army as  a whole as  good.  There issome diarrhoea, dysentery, and  influenza, but  it is diminishing, and  apart from thisthere is very little serious disease.   Nearly all the troops have been inoculated againstcholera and enteric.4     90. The  discipline of the troops as a whole, though perhaps not of the highestorder, mainly owing  to the  lack of experienced officers, is not a cause for misgiving.Regulations as  regards bathing, &amp;c, are rather difficult to enforce.   In the battlesfollowing the  6th August there was a certain lack of discipline among  the new troops,some of whom left the firing line to seek for water.     97. If the question was asked as to whether the Turkish army in  Gallipoli or theAllied force was the better fighting machine, the answer  would be difficult to  give.The Allies are better equipped and supplied with all the accessories of war - artillery,ammunition, aircraft, supplies, naval co-operation, &amp;c. ; the leadership is about equal;but  the super-excellence of the Turkish soldier  in defence, his superior staying powerin this climate, and his  local knowledge, bring  the forces man for man to about anequality.    * Since this information was obtained the secret telegrams show a serious increase in the rate offiickness.  Possibly this may be in part due to a reaction afier the recent great efforts, the failure of whichproduced great disappointment.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON, 1/9/1913.
                                                              71 VSRYJECRET.                    PART  IV.             REMARKS Oil FUTURE POLICY.         ^ 98.  The Government may well ask themselves whether,they are justified in continuing a campaign which^irakes    tremendous a toll on the country in human life and material resources. &quot;How much longer,&quot; they may ask, ttis this running sore to continue to sap our strength?   We were asked for three Divisions in order to secure success, and we gave five.   -Ve deprived France of ammunition and poured it into the Dardanelles.   Yet success has never come.   Nhy should we succeed any better if we provide what is now asked?&quot;    It is evident that every alternative must be examined before we are committed to so dan-gerous and speculative an operation as a winter campaign in the Gallipoli Peninsula.99.  Apart from the scheme already sketched out, the differ- ent courses open to us would appear to be as follows: -       (a)  To resume the naval attack on the Narrows.       (b)  To find a pretext for withdrawal from the camnaign.  .       (c)  To arrive at an arrangement with the Turks after            obtaining the consent of Russia.                     NAVAL ATTACK. 100. A few responsible naval officers are to be found at the Dardanelles, who were present at the abortive naval  attack on the Harrows, and who are convinced that,  if renewed on the following day it would have succeeded -  though even they ad-mit that in all probability the Fleet, if it had effected a passage, would have failed to achieve any great success.
 101. Ihese same officers now hold that the Fleet,- in brder to  relieve the army, should renew the attempt.   They point out that, whereas submarines can never entirely interrupt the water-borne communications of the Army in Gallipoli) two or three battleships, with a few destroyers...and.,m;ne weepers toprotect them against submarines, provisioned for a month, could do so, and in addition could combine with ships in theGulf of Xeros to interrupt the Turkish communications acrossthe isthmus of Bulair.    In making the passage of the Straitsthey would destroy all  the boats, and the Gallipoli Peninsulaentirely isolated, would fall.    This group of officers hasworked the operation out in detail and believes that withproper preparation and  a surprise their object could be a-chieved. 102. Attractive though  this bold proposition is,  and capableand brave though its adherents  have  shown themselves to be,it must be admitted that the overwhelming majority of navalofficers in the Eastern Mediterranean are utterly opposedto it.    The Vice-Admiral is not lacking in dash  or courage,and he has the confidence of the Fleet.    If he proposed theplan - and he has considered it earnestly and long -  theGovernment would be obliged to  give  it their earnest con-sideration and might be justified in sanctioning  it,  providedthey felt satisfied that the possible loss of  the  whole  forceengaged would not unduly weaken our  naval superiority. 103, It would, however, be a mistake for the Government  toorder an attack of this kind except  in the last resort,  or inany way to jrge the Vice-Admiral to  a course to which he isopposed.
             fllfflDRMAL FHOM GALLIPOLI. 304. Two questions arise in connection with the second pro- posal.   Is it tactically possible?   Is it politically pos- sible, having regard to the place that prestige occupies in our system of Imperial Defence? 105. Tactically it would be a matter of the utmost difficulty, but plans for it have been considered as an emergency arrange- ment. 106. The general view of responsible military officers who have considered the question appears to be that, with the exception of wounded men and perhaps of rearguards the bulk of the actual troops could be withdrawn if very careful preparations weremade.    It appears to be considered however that many guns could not be withdrawn,  and that,  besides the guns and wounded,  a large booty would have to be left behind or destroyed. 107. The answer given above  to the first question  affects. the answer to the  second.    The Turks in - announcing the  with- drawal would not underrate the captures of prisoners, guns, and booty,  and would represent that we had been  driven into the sea.   Anyone  can judge  as to the effect of  this on  India and Egypt; 108. It is conceivable that  some means might be  found of &quot;saving our face&quot;  in the evont of withdrawal,  e.g.  to explain that it was done to save Servia from Austria and Bulgaria. The difficulty about this is that the Army in  Gallipoli  is not equipped with  land transport,  and a great  deal  of prepar- ation would be r3quired to render it mobile,  e\ren  if it  could
be^maintainjedja^^                    ?epojjrir*T6gartiLngwhich misgivings are permissible.   Probably it couliPnctarrive in time to  save a disaster in Servia.109. An attractive alternative would be to make a dash intoSyria, to capture Damascus, cut the Hojaz railway, and oc-cupy Syria.   The Powers which had conquered both Bagdad andDamascus would hardly be without prestige in the.J2ast*.evenif they had failed to take Constantinople itself.    The cap-ture of Damascus should be a comparatively easy business,but it would involve the assembly and transport of a quantityof suitable land transport.110. sVith Russian troops on the western side of Lake Van,and with British troops nearing Bagdad, and with an Anglo-French force in occupation of Syria, some progress would havebeen made in the dismemberment of Turkey.&apos;111. This idea, however, does not commend itself to Sir IanHamilton, and there would be great reluctance among theStaff at the Dardanelles to face the tremendous tacticaldifficulties of a withdrawal.           m mm^ML EM TURKEY.112. The third proposal is, while making all preparations  fora winter campaign,  to enter into negotiations with Utrkey.First, however, it would be necessary to obtain the consentof Russia, to say nothing of France, and Italy,  and one al-most hesitates to mention the subject until  this has beendone.113.  At first  sight  it  would  seem most dangerous to thecause of the Allies  to  make such a proposal to Russia.
Badly beaten in. her-main^lfaea-tre. of war, with her army infull retreat, it may seem Mat                            forpolitically from the war except the acquisition of Constant-inople and the Straits.   To deprive her of this prospect wouldit may be urged, cause her to lose all interest in the warand drive her into a separate peace despite treaties to thecontrary.114. On a strategical view of the situation, however, tt^woullseem more in Russia&apos;s interest to obtain the opening of theStsaits at once than to wait for the definite collapse ofTurkey, which may be delayed indefinitely.    If the Straitswere opened Russia could&quot;start to re-equip  herself, which itis impossible for her to do effectively otherwise instead otwaiting for the collapse of Turkey.115, The question would have to be discussed wry franklywith the Russian representatives and migjit  be stated in terms,somewhat as follows:-     H ;Vhen the -Western Allies decided  to attack the Dar-danelles they had two main objects in  view;  the first,strategical, to open a line of communications to the BlackSea, in order that Russia might equip  herself from the /tes-tern markets and export her grain;  the second was politicaland aimed at rallying the Balkan States to  our cause.   Rus-sia then at once represented that,  in  the event of success,her national aspirations demanded that Constantinople andthe Straits should fall to her.   This demand was quite out-side the strategical objects for which the  Allies enteredon this operation, and involved on the part both of GreatBritain and France a great concession  of principle and areversal of previous policy; from this concession of principle
 neither country has any desire to recede.   The practical question now arises, however, as to whether the political objects which Russia seeks to gain at Constantinople can be achieved without jeopardising the cause of the Allies, not only in the vVesty but in Russia itself.   The Dardanelles campaign has proved a far more formidable enterprise than was originally anticipated, and has cost the Western Allies veryheavy losses both in men and material.   After a very ex-hausting summer campaign they find themselves faced withthe prospect of an even more arduous and exacting wintercampaign, the result of which it is difficult to foreseewith certainty.   If the campaign is continued the Allieswill do their best to achieve success at art early date,but they cannot conceal from their Ally that it involvesuncertainties from which the possibility (even if a remoteone) of a great disaster,  cannot be excluded.    Such adisaster would, they believe, have a most far-reaching andprejudicial effect on the  cause of the Allies throughoutthe world.   Moreover,  the Western Allies,are bound to admitthat the conquest of Constantinople may,  even under favour-able conditions,  take many months to achieve,  and they mustpoint out that in the meantime the urgent need of Russiafor the re-establishment of communication with the outsideworld cannot be met.    In  these circumstances they have  feltbound to discover whether  there is any method of achievingthe strategical and political desiderata for which they  com-menced this enterprise  without the dangers,  delays,  arid  ter-rible drain on their resources involved in  a winter campaign.At this point it should be made clear that  no  overtures  of
 any sort  or kind have yet been made  to  Turkey,  which  would prejudice Russia&apos;s political interests, or will be made without Russian consent.   At the  same  time it  should be pointed out that the great obstacle  to  the early  realisation of  our original strategical and political aim is  absolutely barred by the Russian insistence on  the occupation of Con- stantinople.   There is some reason  to hope that, if  Turkey could be  guaranteed the retention of Constantinople,  or pos sibly even its internationalisation under Turkish suzer- ainty, she might throw over the Germans, make peace,  and open the  Straits;  but, so long as Constantinople is in jeopardy  there is no prospect of this, and the Turks  will obstinately continue their step by step defence, and  will even face a winter campaign in Gallipoli,  which is as full of difficulties and uncertainties to them as to the Allies. Similarly in the Balkans the whole attitude of the nation would change if an assurance were given that Constantinople and the Straits were not to pass into Russian  control.   It should be represented to Russia that it is more important for her to open the Straits immediately, in order that shemay re-equip herself and bring the war to  an end next  year, than to wait for a solution of the problem,  which if reached would satisfy her political aspirations, but may never come about, and is fraught with  the possibility of  irretrievable disaster to the cause of the Allies.    In  short,  Russia should be asked to postpone to some future date  her politi- cal aspirations in Constantinople,  in the  interests  of win- ning the war. 116. Such should be the  main lines of the  communication to Russia, but it might also be insinuated tactfully that Russia,
 owing to her great exertions elsewhere in  the  cause  of  the Allies, has not been able to give the practical assistance  at the Dardanelles which was hoped for, and that  it is hardly reasonable to expect the Allies to take such tremendous risks and make such sacrifices for a cause which is  solely to the benefit of Russia, vriien all strategical advantages can be ob- tained without them. 117. So far as Turkey is concerned the difficulties of opening a negotiation do not  appear insuperable;  they should, of course, be timed to follow some success to the Allied arms such as the capture of the Sari Bair Ridge.    Ihe position of the Allies is difficult,  but that of the lurks is far from en- viable. 118. Ihe harrassment  of their communications become ever great- er.   Ihe number of submarines normally in the Marmora has been raised from an occasional one to a continuous one  and an occas- ional  two;  very soon  there will always be  two and  occasionally three.   Ihe seaplanes  are also beginning to worry their sea-borne  communications.    Very recently a systematic attack  of their  communications  over Bulair,  by Monitors supported byballoons and seaplanes  has been substituted for the compara- tively ineffective destroyer patrol.    It  is desirable  that the importance of this  should continually be impressed  on  the local  command.    vVhen winter comes their  roads  both in  Europe and Asia will  become  impassable for  heavy  traffic.    And,  ashas been pointed out  in this paper the  Allies at Anzac  are almost within  a stone&apos;8 throw of points from which they menace the communications of the Gallipoli  army  very seriously.    In these  circumstances,  though  the Turks may be able  to hang  on, if inspired by the thought that they are  dying  in  the last ditch for Constantinople, it is difficult  to believe  that  they
would not welcome a peace,  if -gaararrfee^pas^^capital.   The economic Isolation of their country, and the  ^position in Mesopotamia and the unrest in many parts of thecountry should further urge them to such a course.119. They would have a further inducement to come to termsif Russia could only interrupt their coal supply more effect-ually in the Black Sea,  as  the Turkish Navy, sea transport,.railways, munition factories,  bakeries, etc,  are absolutelydependent on it.    In spite of our many representations onthe subject Russia has never succeeded in an effective inter-ruption and further requests should .be made to her  on thesubject.133. The doubt,  of course,  remains as to whether the TurkishSinbad can shake the German old man of the sea off  his back,but many versed in Turkish  affairs believe this to  be possible.131. Summing up,  the steps  to  carry out this proposal would besomewhat as follows:-         (1)  To come to an arrangement with Prance:         (2)  To discuss the question very frankly  with Russia:         (3)  If Russia consents,  and only on  this  condition,              to open a negotiation with Turkey through some              very informal channel(suggestions on  this head              can be made,  if  required):         (4)  Meanwhile to  make unceasing preparations for a              winter campaign.         (5)  Italy would also have to be settled with.122. Both the Vice-Admiral  and the General Officer  Commanding-in-Chief stated they would  have no objection from their res-pective points of view to such a negotiation,  provided that
no  initiative in the matter was expected to come from themor  from the forces under their command, and provided thatpreparations for a winter campaign were continued simultan-eously.   If this plan was adopted it would be advisable tokeep them both in ignorance.123. It should be noted that all authorities on the Balkansand on Turkey, with whom the writer had opportunities ofconversation,  insisted on the objections which all  BalkanStates have to a Russian occupation of Constantinople.These included Sir Francis Elliott, Sir Rennell Rodd,  SirValentine Chifol,  Mr.  Gregory,  and others. 124. Such then are the main alternatives to a sustained of- fensive at the Dardanelles.   It has not even been thought worth while to mention further efforts in the Balkans.    IfBulgaria can be induced to march, so much the better for the Allies, but it is difficult to believe that she will do so while the Russian reverses continue,  unless we ourselves obtain a great success on the Gallipoli  peninsula.   Mean- while our offers to Bulgaria are causing exasperation inGreece and Servian   Moreover, there is  no question that they have lowered the prestige of the Allies in the Balkans.Both British and Greek residents in Greece remarked this. (A Greek officer in the train was overheard to say that of course the Allies needed Bulgaria or Greece at the Dardan- elles, because their army there was &quot;a mere rabble*)   At any rate our plans must clearly be made  quite independently of Bulgarian co-operation.
 125. Another alternative,  which has not been considered ser- iously here, is a policy of Mholding on.w   Nearly as many troops are required for this as for a renewed offensive, and the amount of ground to be gained, at Anzac at any rate, to place us within reasonable distance of a. b:g success, is so small that it would be preposterous not to make the at- tempt. 126. The materials for the decision,  so far as local consid- erations are concerned, have been set  forth above as fully as possible, but,  if any further details are required,  they will be furnished.    The final  decision, however,  must de-pend on a wider appreciation of the situation than is pos- sible to one who for some weeks has been almost wholly out of touch with news  of world-wide affairs.
