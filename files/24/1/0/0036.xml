G.-31.COMMITTEE OP  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Minute by  the  Secretary, Military  Department, India Office,        on the question  of an  Advance  to  Baghdad.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,           October 16, 1915.
MINUTE  BY THE SECRETARY,  MILITARY DEPARTMENT, INDIA  OFFICE,         ON THE QUESTION  OF AN  ADVANCE  TO  BAGHDAD.     NOW that it has been decided to send two divisions to Mesopotamia, the conditionpostulated in my note of the 4th October is fully met.  I said therein :      &quot; In my judgment it will not be wise to go to Baghdad unless we can increase the          force by a whole division of infantry and one  or two cavalry regiments.          and this we know is impracticable unless the Indian troops are withdrawn          from France.&quot;     The view I then held was that if we got an extra division it would be safe to goto Baghdad.   A fortiori, if we get two divisions, it will be more than safe.  We shallthen have three divisions and four  cavalry regiments in the  Baghdad area, and onedivision and  two cavalry regiments from Kut-el-Amara to the sea.  This means a forceof about 30,000 men within the  Baghdad area, of which  probably  25,000 could onemergency be concentrated for battle at Samarra or  other  suitable position betweenSamarra and Baghdad.     I understand that  the General Staff  hold  the view that 60,000 Turks or moremight be utilised  to attack us, but though that  number might be available, I doubtif they can be concentrated for battle in the face of an active commander with 25,000men holding the interior lines in a selected and prepared position.     If the enemy operates by both the Euphrates and the Tigris lines he  should bebeaten in  detail; if he operates only by  the Tigris  he will  have great difficulty inconcentrating within striking distance.  I therefore hold that with this  force at ourdisposal it will be worth our while to go to Baghdad, as, anyhow, the Turks would notbe in a position to attack it under three months, and for three months we should haveall the moral advantage of holding a great political centre and strategical position.     Further, if the Turks have not in the meanwhile gained a great success at theDardanelles,  that period of three months might well be prolonged to next April, whenthe hot season will be beginning and the Turks will not be tempted to embark on soserious an operation.   In that case the  moral  and political advantage of holdingBaghdad will be indefinitely prolonged.     If, on the  other hand,  I am wrong,  and the Turks can concentrate 50,000 or60,000 men against us, at the worst we should have to retire to Kut-el-Amara, having firstdeprived the enemy of many of the advantages Baghdad would ordinarily confer.   Weshould have removed all shipping, destroyed the  railway and  rolling-stock, and takenpossession of all munitions of war and transport.     Further, having for all  those months interrupted the  communications betweenBaghdad and Persia, we should have emasculated the German movement in Persia andpostponed trouble on the Indian frontier.     If,  therefore, we have a firm promise  of two divisions, I am entirely in favour ofgoing to  Baghdad, while, if we get only one division added to Force &quot; D,&quot; we might stillconsider the  advisability of a raid and retirement.  That is to say, General Nixon, withtwo divisions and three  cavalry regiments  in the Baghdad area, will be able, whateverthe Turks may do:      1. To spoil  their  advanced base  by  removing or destroying  all stores  and          transport now available in the area.     2. To cut them off  from all communication  with Persia  for at least two or three          months.     3. To postpone trouble from Afghanistan for that period.     4. To keep the Basra vilayet and the oilfields quiet for a like period.      fll41]
    Before the three months have elapsed the position may have entirely changed inour favour elsewhere, but whatever we decide we must decide quickly or  the moraleffect of Kut-el-Amara will have worn om    I have described the advantages of offensive action, but I am not oblivious to itsdangers.   The political effect of eventual retirement will  be bad, but there will have-been  compensatory advantages, and, moreover, we should have  been given time toprepare a formidable Torres Vedras at Kut-el-Amara, and some of our gunboats willbe ready to guard the river.    In fact, I may summarise the  policy herein advocated  as  &quot; frappez fort maisfrappez vite.&quot;                                                         E.  Q. BARROW,                                                                      General.    October 15, 1915.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON. 16/10/1915.
