Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  February 1915.SECRET.  G-6.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE  WAR.Memorandum by Mr. A. J. Balfour.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,             February 24, 1915.
THE  WAR.   &apos;. I THINK. it may help us to a sound  decision next Friday if we hear clearly inmind  that  the  forcing of the Dardanelles is the preliminary stage  of two. military.operations, which are  quite  separable  in  fact,  and ought  to be  separated  in  ourthoughts.   I will call them respectively the Bosphorus operation  and the Balls anoperation.         ...  &apos;..  .      .&quot;        .    .    .    .        .  -             -..    By the Bosphorus  operation  I. mean  the control of the Sea  of Marmora,  theBosphorus, and Constantinople.   Were this carried out successfully, although it stood-alone, we should paralyse Turkey ;  we should secure free communications with Russia,with all that this  carries with it; we  should have defeated the German ambitions inthe Near East; we. should (I believe) have secured  the  neutrality  of Bulgaria; andwe should have, shown to all,the world what sea power means.- &apos;  .&apos;    These advantages are not easy to- over-estimate.  Yet I fully admit that they would-be far surpassed if we could bring to a. successful issue the second, or Balkan policy.This policy aims at nothing less, than bringing into  the struggle at least Roumania and -Greece, possibly Bulgaria, and uniting the whole of  the - South-East of  Europe withBritain and France in a combined action against the Central Powers.                  .    If this could be successfully effected, its influence on  the fortunes of the war mustbe great, and might be decisive.    It is unfortunately extremely  difficult perhaps at this moment impossible towork  out all the elements in the complicated problem which it presents.   The.course of events depends  upon the policy of three small States, who, from  the verynecessities  of their position,  are  obliged to  incline  to   that side in the Europeanstruggle which they think is likely  to win, and whose views are largely swayed by thesmall local hopes and hatreds.  It is impossible in such circumstances  clearly to thinkout a course of a military campaign in  these regions until we know irtw is going to fighton our side and -when.  And our difficulties  are  not  diminished by the fact that, onthe most sanguine  estimate which Ave dare make, the number of Anglo-French troopswhich could take part in the Balkan operations would only be a relatively small fractionof the troops which the Balkan States themselves have at their disposal.    This is a very important point which I think we are apt to  forget.  Wellington^army in the Peninsula, though not large, was the only one that  could stand up againstthe French,   It was the controlling military factor  in the situation.   This can neverbe paralleled in South-East Europe.  The  Roumanian, Bulgarian, and Greek armiesare not only separately and collectively larger  than any that  the  Allies, for a long-time to come, can put into this theatre of  operations, but they form very efficientlighting units.   Our superiority.is a naval and financial one, supported, no doubt, byimmense, but distant, reserves of power.    The conclusions I draw are as follows :-    We must send  as.many troops as may be required to  make  the Bosphorusoperation, to  which we are now  committed, a- success.  But whether  we should sendmore  than this  number  depends  upon the  answer  to two questions which I think;we have not yet sufficiently  discussed : (a)  Do we  want the  Balkan States to  joinus at once ? and (6) Would sending. 110,000 men induce them to join us ?    As regards (a),  I should like  very  much to know whether it  would be to ourinterest that Roumania, for example, should declare war within the next month. Wouldit not expose her to being, crushed before Russia  was  strong  enough to come to herassistance?  And would  any force which  we  could conceivably send  through theBosphorus be sufficient to turn the scale ?    If these questions, and other parallel questions with regard  to Greece, be answeredin the negative,  it  would seem  that the  maintenance  for  the  present of Balkanneutrality is to  our advantage, and that nothing would be gained by sending to theEast more troops than are required for what I have called the Bosphorus operation.
NTED AT THE FOREIGN OFF1CK BY C. R. HARRISON.-25,2/1915.    If, on the  other hand, it is desirable  to induce  Greece and  Roumania to takeimmediate action, and if sending 110,001) men, instead of 40,000, is going to make thedifference, then it might be proper to take risks in the  West, and to  send every man wecan spare to aid in the Balkan operations.    I am not sure that  sending troops much in excess of what are required for theBosphorus operation would really  give the impression  of  military strength.  Thedifference between the smallest force which  it is proposed to send and the largest forcewhich we can afford to send is, I gather, somewhere about 70,000 men.  This, speakingfrom recollection, is about one-seventh of the Bulgarian army and  about-one-tenth ofthe Roumanian army.   I find it difficult to believe that this would be regarded as avery important addition to the local armies ;  or that, if the Balkans remained obstinatelyneutral, it would add to our prestige to have them encamped  in the neighbourhood ofthe Sea of Marmora, doing nothing, while important fighting was going on elsewhere.It is certainly arguable (I  do  not put it  higher) that  to carry  out the  Bosphorusoperation effectively and rapidly, to provide  all the troops that may be required for thispurpose,  and (this feat accomplished) to negotiate with Servia, Greece, and  Roumaniaas to the next step to be taken, might  give  better results  even as regards the Balkanoperation than the alternative course.  But this turns upon questions, diplomatic aswell as military, on which I am  not competent to offer  an opinion.     Only one further observation would I make, which points in the direction of notbeing niggardly as regards the number of troops we send or their quality.   We are allagreed that, whatever else is done^ the Bosphorus operation must be carried throughto a successful termination.  This may involve a pitched battle with Turkish troops inthe neighbourhood of  Constantinople; and, so far as I  could gather from our lastdiscussion, wre  have no very precise information as to the number and quality of theTurkish troops with which, in such  circumstances, we  might have to deal.   Evidentlywe must  work with ample margins,  for a check there might amount to a disaster.                                                                      A. J. B.    February 24, 1915.
