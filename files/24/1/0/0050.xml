ISSupplies  of Important Commodities Available to the Enemy          /        from Balkan Sources.Memorandum by. the Board of Trade.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,           December 3, 1915.
SUPPLIES OF  IMPORTANT  COMMODITIES  AVAILABLE  TO  THE                 ENEMY FROM BALKAN SOUBCES.     IN this memorandum an attempt is made to estimate, so far as statistical material is available, the extent to which the supply to Germany and Austria-Hungary of certain important commodities (foodstuffs and raw materials) has been  facilitated  by recent political and military events in South-Eastern Europe and the through communication which the Central Empires have succeeded in establishing with Bulgaria and  Turkey.     At the outset, however, attention must be drawn to the fact that the statistics are open to criticism in two respects.   In the first place, they are not very recent: the latest of any kind available relate to the year 1910-11  for  the Ottoman Empire, and to 1911 for Serbia and Bulgaria ; and secondly, the Board of Trade  have no information as to the extent to which  production in the Balkan States  was adversely affected by the two Balkan wars, or,  in  the  case of Serbia, as to the extent to which the  immediately available  supplies  of agricultural  produce have  been destroyed  by  or because of  the recent invasion.&apos;     Further, it is- obvious  that  the utility of  the  supplies which  the new military situation puts within the German and Austrian reach depends not only on the quantity of such supplies, but on the ease with which they can be transported.   The agricultural and other products of Bulgaria, and of Serbia  so far as they have not been  destroyed, are presumably readily available by the Danube  or by railway ; but this would appear not to be  true to anything like  the same  extent  of the products of Asiatic Turkey, which, from the present point of view, is much the most important part of the Ottoman Empire. -  $p doufyt the railways of Asia  Minor  up  to  Haidar-Pascha are  in full operation, but with&apos;a large part of Mesopotamia in  British&apos; military occupation, and  the Mediterranean  and Black Sea  littorals blockaded,  the usual  movement of Turkish produce must be seriously impeded. -  1     Subject to these general considerations, we may  proceed to examine the situation as  to the more important  commodities  in  respect of  which  the  Central Empires are understood to be suffering from shortage.     (a.) Grain. In 1911 the export-of wheat from Serbia amounted to 92,000 metric tons, from Bulgaria  it was  303,000 metric tons, whilst from Asiatic Turkey  it was insignificant (4,000  metric  tons).   If these figures  be  taken  as  representing the exportable surplus, beyond domestic requirements, we get a total available for Germany and Austria- Hungary of sbmething;&quot;under-400,000  tons.&apos;: As the  normal consumption (average 1909-13) of wheat in the German Empire alone is about  6,000,000  tons, the Balkan supply thus  made  available  would   not  appear  to offer  any appreciable compensation for the cutting off from Germany of the Russian, Argentine, and United States supplies, on which she had drawn largely prior to the war (to the average extent of 1,900,000 tons for the period 1909-13).   Even if the  whole Serbian production, on the basis&quot;  of the&apos;output&apos; &quot;of&apos; 1912,&quot; could be secured, this would not&quot; very &quot;seriously affect the situation;  it would  put a further  250,000  tons at the disposal of  the Central Empires.  On the other hand, for the present Germany and Austria are largely drawing upon the very considerable Roumanian supplies.     As regards barley, the exports in 1911 were: from Serbia,  20,000 metric tons; from Bulgaria,  75,000  tons; from Asiatic  Turkey, 135,000  tons;  a  total from these three sources of 230,000 tons.  A considerable amount of the  Turkish production was, however,  exported from Mesopotamia by way of the Persian Gulf, and it  is doubtful if facilities exist for the shipment on any serious scale of the produce of that region by any other route.  The estimated average total consumption of barley in the German Empire alone for  the years 1909-13 was 6,300,000 tons, of which rather less than one-half was&apos; imported, and here,  again, even if a supply to  the full extent  of the  230,000 tons mentioned above were obtainable from Serbia, Bulgaria, and Turkey, it , would, go only a short way to meet the deficiency due to the cutting-off of the  Russian supplies (which
averaged over 2,500,000 tons).   But in this case also the possibility of the Roumaniansupply  being  drawn upon must  be taken into account;  the quantity  available  is,however, very  much smaller than in the case of wheat, while the German demand isvery much larger.     In the case of maize the export from Serbia amounted in 1911  to  117,000 metrictons, and from Bulgaria to 355,000 metric tons ; that from Asiatic Turkey was negligible,These quantities, if available for Germany, would be a very  substantial  contribution^ toher  needs,  as  they represent  over  one-half. of  her   normal  annual  consumption(804,000 tons) in the period 1909-13, all of which was imported, and are nearly as largeas her pre-war importations from Russia and the Argentine, her chief sources of supply.If supplies on anything like this scale can be secured from Bulgaria and Serbia, and theamount usually drawn by Germany from Roumania a large producer can be increased,as is probably the case,  there seems no obvious reason why Germany should not get  backto something approximating to her normal supplies.    As  regards other grains, the Balkan production is negligible.     (-&amp;.) Meat. The following  statement shows for the  latest  years available  theestimated numbers of cattle, sheep, pigs, and goats in the various Balkan States, otherthan Greece  (for  which country  no  statistics  are  available),  and  in  the  CentralEmpires : ... - - . . -	Serbia.	Bulgaria.	Roumania.	Germany.	Austria-Hungary.Cattle Sheep Pigs .. Goats	958,000 (1910) 3,809,000 (1910) 864,000 (191.0) 627,000 (1910)	1,696,000 (1909) 8,131,000 (1908) 465,000 (1905) 1,384.000 (1905)	2,588,000* (1909) 5,655,000 (1900) 1.709,000 (1900) 232,000 (1900)	20,182,000 . (1912) 5,803,000 (1912) 21,924,000 (1912) 3,410,000 (1912)	16,178.000 (1909) 10,505,000 (1902 and 1907) 1 14,013,000 (1910-11) 1,684,000 (1910-11)* Including buffaloes.     These statistics relate to such diverse dates that they are not strictly comparable, but they serve to indicate the general position, and the extent to which the supplies of the Central Empires could be supplemented from the Balkans.   It will  be seen that as regards neither beef nor pork, which constitute  by far the most important factors  in the normal  meat  consumption of Germany,  could the  Balkan  States  make  any appreciable contribution towards that Empire&apos;s requirements  alone,  even if the Serbian cattle and pigs had survived recent events in any large numbers.  (The  normal exports from these  countries,  as  from Asiatic  Turkey, were insignificant.)  The  position  is different in respect of sheep, as to which the total numbers in the three Balkan States appear to approximate closely  to those of the Central Empires, and there are of course very large  numbers in the Ottoman Empire (estimated at about 40,000,000, but, unless the war has produced already a very considerable change in the dietary habits of the German  people, resulting in a much enhanced consumption of mutton, this will not appreciably help to solve the problem  of the German meat supply.   The small number of pigs available in the Balkans is  important, as the mistaken  policy adopted  by the German  Government earlier in the war in respect of the slaughter of pigs has resulted in a shortage of fats which cannot be remedied from the Balkans.     (c.)  Raw Materials. The occupation of  Serbia will give the Central Empires control of the copper output of that country.  The copper  ore has been worked in the neighbourhood of Maidanpek, Bor,  and  Liprik, and  the quantity of copper  metal produced was 6,723 metric tons in 1911 and 7,355 metric  tons  in  1912.  How far  it may be  possible for the invaders  to  develop  the mines and enlarge the  output the Board of Trade are not in a  position to judge, but, in view of  the  fact that the average annual  importation  of  copper  into  Germany alone  in the  period  1908-12   was 181,000 metric tons (of which  160,000  from the United States), the possible Serbian&quot;contribution, unless it can be developed  very rapidly, whilst welcome, would  not go far towards making good the deficiency.  There is a copper mine of quite small importance at Plakalritza in Bulgaria,  and some working of copper  ores in Asiatic Turkey, but these are of no practical importance.  There is a certain amount of lead  produced  in Greece, mainly in the south  (Laurium), the exports in 1913 amounting to 17,000  tons. This represents an appreciable addition to the German and Austrian  output from native
ore (about 97,000 tons in 1912).  Germany, however, depends, of course, mainly  onforeign sources of supply for lead and lead ore.   In 1913 she  imported 84,000 tons ofmetallic lead and 143,000 tons of lead ore.   There appear to  be some small  depositsof antimony  ore  in  Serbia, but supplies of other metals of  military value  are notavailable,  so far as the Board are aware, from Balkan or Turkish sources.     As regards textile materials, the export  of raio wool from Serbia and Bulgaria istrivial (9 and 61 metric tons respectively in  1911); from Asiatic Turkey it is fairlylarge-8,430 metric tons, or roughly 18,500,000 lb., in 1910-11.  If the whole  of thiscould be obtained for the Central Empires, which is doubtful, or it could be enlarged,it would go but a very little way towards meeting the  deficiency caused  in Germanyby the cutting off of her normal imports of 436,000,000 lb. (1908-12) ; and  in  viewof the probable destruction of large  numbers of the Serbian sheep, and the maintenanceof the normal Bulgarian domestic demand for wool, it seems unlikely that the  Balkanswill  be  of any service to Germany in this respect (the Roumanian export is also small).The  same  remarks apply with even  greater force to raw cotton, of which  the  averageannual German consumption in 1908-12 was 405,000 metric tons. There is a very smallproduction in Greece (about 6,000 metric  tons a year at present) and  none  in Serbiaand  Bulgaria; in Asiatic Turkey the output of the vilayets  of Aidin  and Adana wasestimated at  about 30,000 metric tons in  1912-13, and there  is cotton growing on whatis not much more than an experimental scale  in  the Jordan  valley and  other parts ofthe Ottoman Empire.     As regards the  other industrial materials of which  the Central Empires areunderstood to be  in need, the Balkans can give no help in respect of rubber, and littlein respect of hides and skins (of these  last  Germany imported in 1912,  247,000metric tons; the exports in 1911  weie  from Serbia, 1,650 metric tons, from Bulgaria,1,620 metric tons, and from Asiatic Turkey,  8,200 metric tons.  From Boumania theywere 927 metric tons).   In the case  of mineral oils, the Turkish production is very localand  limited.   Large deposits  are believed to exist in Mesopotamia, and in the  countrylying northward of that region, in Syria, and elsewhere, but nowhere have they yet beenworked on a commercial  scale, nor  does  it appear probable that they can be so workedin present circumstances.   On  the  other hand, Germany can no doubt  draw at presentlargely on Roumania, where German oil interests have a substantial holding.                                                                       P. A.     Board of Trade, Commercial Department,               November 30, 1915.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R, HARRISON.  7/12/1915.
