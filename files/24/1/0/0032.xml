Henderson.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,            October 12, 1915,
TERMS  OP  REFERENCE.    A Committee of the Cabinet consisting of the nnder-named was appointed by theCabinet:         The Most Honourable the MARQUESS OF CREWE, KG., Lord President of the            Council (in the Chair).        The Right Honourable the EARL CURZON OP KEDLESTON,  G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.,            Lord Privy Seal.        The Right Honourable A. CHAMBERLAIN, M.P., Secretary of State for India.        The Right Honourable  W. S. CHURCHILL, M.P., Chancellor of the  Duchy of            Lancaster.        The Right Honourable  the EARL OF SELBORNE, K.G., &amp;c, President of the            Board of  Agriculture.        The Right  Honourable A. HENDERSON, M.P.,  President  of  the Board of            Education.    While no specific terms of reference were communicated to the Committee, it wasunderstood that they were  assembled to ascertain and examine the resources of thiscountry and of our Allies for the prosecution of the War up to the end of the year 1916-
WAR POLICY.Report.    THE  Committee have  thought it their  duty,  in  the absence- of  any specificterms of reference, to enquire into  the  extent to which the existing resources of thecountry are being utilised or  can be developed in order to bring the war to a successfulissue at the earliest possible moment, and to  ascertain how far new resources can bebrought into play with the same object.  This involved examination of  the existingsystem of voluntary recruiting for the Services, and  some general consideration of thealternative of compulsion.  They have endeavoured to make the enquiry as wide andas complete as was feasible  in  view of  the term of about a fortnight within whichthey were asked to present their Report.  In the twelve meetings which they have heldthey have purposely confined themselves to the examination of official  witnesses, andthey have had the advantage of questioning  six of  their  colleagues in the  Cabinet,representing  the  Departments  of War, the Admiralty,  Munitions, the Treasury, theBoard of Trade, and the Local Government Board.    2.  It was evident to the Committee that the resources of  the Empire for thepurposes of  the war might properly be  classified under three heads : (1) men actuallyengaged or  to be engaged in the fighting services ; (2) provision for  the continuoussupply of munitions and equipment for the fighting forces  of the British Empire or ofour Allies ; (3) financial supplies for sustaining the burden of the  war.   Under thislast heading is included the maintenance of those industries in the United Kingdomwhich are required either (a) for providing the necessaries of life for the inhabitantsof these islands or (b) for supporting such a  volume of exports as will prevent thecreation of a ruinous balance of trade against this country, in view of the inevitablepreponderance of imports during the period of  the war.    3. In a contest in which Allies are engaged it does not follow that each will makethe most valuable  contribution towards victory by dividing its energies  equally inpursuit of these three objects.   It may even abandon some of them altogether.  Whenfrom 1758 to 1761 Frederick II was at war with the Empire and Fiance, Great Britainsent him no direct aid either by sea or land, but she  devoted millions to subsidies,,without which Prussia would probably have been unable to bear the continued burden.Or, to  take a hypothetical instance from this present struggle, if the United Stateshad joined  the Allies at  an early stage, and national amour-propre had impelled themto enlist large forces for the  field in  place of supplying  munitions to  European Stateswith greater capacity for training  officers for their own  new troops, their adhesionwould  have proved a positive disadvantage.    4. As  it is, however, we have already done and are doing much in enrolling andtraining men, in the provision of munitions of war, and in  raising funds for our ownuse and that of our  Allies  ; consequently, the  problem for the Government is thediscovery of the correct  proportion of national energy to be devoted in the  commoninterest to each purpose respectively for the future.Men.    5. It is convenient in the first instance to examine the population resources of thedifferent belligerents, and to utter the necessary cautions against the mere enumerationof the males of military age belonging to each, and the assumption  that aU  such areavailable for military service.  Taking the enemy first, it is not profitable for thispurpose to calculate the resources in men possessed by the Turkish Empire.   Turningto Germany, it  is estimated by the military  authorities  that from a population o        [1112]                ^            *                              B
55  millions, the estimated figure for  1899 half of them males about 170 divisions,totalling 3 millions, are now at the front.   Troops in training, garrisons, and line  ofcommunication troops, make  up a further 1,400,000.   The  net wastage  from theGerman Army, according to the German returns, stands at 1,300,000, but our militaryauthorities believe that, this figure is greatly under the mark, as appears by comparisonwith other estimates which can be checked.    If the population of Austria-Hungary is given as 46^ millions on the same basis,the 23  million males have so  far produced about 09 divisions, making 1  millions atthe front.  The reserves, &amp;c. are estimated at 650,000, to be set against a net wastageof 1,600,000.    The general conclusion reached by the War Office is that on the 1st April,  1916,31- million Germans  and lrr million  Austrians  may be expected to be  in  the  field.It should be added that the figures of  wastage  are to a large extent conjectural, as thereturns can in no case be accepted as  conclusive.    6. In the case of the Allied countries, it is thought expedient to omit Belgium andSerbia from  the comparison.    Russia, also, has to be differently considered,  sincemention  of  the 125 millions of  her population of IS99 (apart from the Central Asianprovinces) would be merely misleading.   She can,  indeed, only be  properly  regardedin terms of rifles.  It is estimated  by the  military authorities that she now maintainsin the field  106 divisions, amounting to 1^- millions.  Her reserves,  &amp;c, are put  at3  millions ;  but the figure is very uncertain.  The  net wastage of the Russian army isstated to be 3,200,000.    The French figures,  however, can be definitely compared with those given forGermany.   France is credited with 100 divisions, or 1,800,000 men, with 1 million ofreserves, garrison troops, &amp;c,  and  the French  net  wastage is placed  by herself  at600,000.  This last figure, however, appears to  be an  under-estimate, and  probably1 million would be nearer the  mark.    Italy is credited with 35 divisions, making 650,000 men at the front, with 850,000of reserves,  &amp;c,, and a net wastage of 25,000 to the present date.    Pursuing the comparison for the 1st April, 1916, it is  believed  that Russia,  bythat time in  possession  of If millions of modern  rifles, should have a field army ofsome 2\ millions, of whom 200,000 might be in the Caucasus.   The Italian total forthe same date is stated at 1,250,000.     7. The above  calculation for next  spring, making  a total of  5,000,000 for theCentral Powers, and,  5,300,000 for the Allies without any inclusion of British troops,appears  highly favourable to  the  latter.  But in our judgment it would be altogetherunsafe to draw a  sanguine  conclusion from these figures.   Apart  from the gravemilitary situation of the moment, and from the prospective difficulties respectingmunitions of war,  of which we shall speak later,  it must be remembered  that theholding  of  the  interior lines by  the Central Powers,  and their practical  unity  ofcommand, to say nothing of the prestige of recent  successes, are worth several ArmyCorps to them.    8. Coming  to  the British forces, including, as  in the  former calculations, thearmy at the Dardanelles, with its base  in Egypt, and the  Dominion  and Indiandivisions in Europe,  but  none  of the troops  engaged  in various parts of  Asia andAfrica, it is found that they  comprise 39 divisions, making 700,000 actually at thefront, with a further figure of  1,600,000 of reserves in  training, garrison, and line  ofcommunication troops.  The net wastage  to date is 200,000.  It is believed that thenet wastage of our whole expeditionary force must be continually reckoned at  well over5 per cent, per month.  On this basis it may be  reasonable to estimate the strength inthe field of the British  Army on  the  1st April, 1916, at 1^- millions,  or about70 divisions.  The prospect of maintaining that force at its full establishment untilthe end of 1916 must be considered later with the question of  recruiting, and with thegeneral consideration of what  is to be our due contribution to the Allied Field Armies.Munitions.     9. But  it is advisable first to touch on the  question  of arms and  other munitionsof Avar, without Avhich no number of men, even though trained as are  some  of theRussian unarmed reserves, can be counted as an active element in any army.  It beingimpossible to produce all necessary munitions by labour of less than military capacityand more than military age, or to import the whole deficit from abroad, the problem oftheir supply has an obvious bearing upon that which has just been presented.     10.  As  regards  artillery,  Mr.   Lloyd George  stated that by May next  yearthere could in certain circumstances  be ready a supply of 18-pr. field-guns  sufficient
for 100 divisions, with a reasonable and improving margin, and adequate ammunition.This was in addition to a number of  15-prs.,  which  would be valuable for homedefence.  In the heavier natures  of guns and howitzers this war has introduced anentirely new standard of requirements, as is shown by the fact that on the outbreak ofwar there were only 87 guns and howitzers of 6-inch  and upwards  in existence, andat the time of the Artillery Conference held at Boulogne last June  only 218 guns  andhowitzers of 6-inch and over  were in the field or had been  ordered ; whereas thenumber of heavy guns and howitzers of 6-inch, and  over, now in the field and underorder, has reached a total  of  992.  Yet this large increase will  not  attain even for70 divisions the full standard of heavy artillery  up to which, as was suggested at theBoulogne Conference, it is desirable to work.  In this  matter of heavy guns the Com-mittee^paid  particular attention to the competing claims which might arise between thenaval and military Departments ; and they were glad to find that a regular system of com-raunication and  conference is carried on between them, whereby questions of precedencecan be discussed and decided.  -In the special circumstances of the time, it appearedto the Committee that  such plant as can readily  be adapted  to the making of militaryordnance  may properly be transferred  for a time  from Admiralty use, even at the riskof some naval postponements, in  view of the more urgent needs of the Army so latelyrealised.  As the present Admiralty programme progresses towards  completion in theearly part of next  year,  the possibility of such a transfer  will become  increasinglyevident.    11. In  the  case of  machine  guns  also it  has  been  found that the numberconventionally required for our Army before the war was altogether inadequate.  Thetremendous  use -made by the Germans of this weapon  is generally familiar ; and  it isrecognised by the  War  Office  that their  tentative estimate of 8,500 German machineguns now with the troops may be greatly under  the mark, since  they are frequentlyemployed in large batteries as  well as attached  to  a  battalion.  In  our own case theposition should  be  satisfactory by next June at any rate,  when the  orders  shouldproduce a  large  margin  over  the  AVar Office  estimate of  eight -per  battalion for70 divisions.    12. A certain difficulty appeared in  ascertaining  the real needs of the Army inrespect of rifles,  and also the possibility of satisfying those needs, since the number tobe originally allotted to  a division was estimated on more than one basis, and therewas also a divergence of opinion on the real wastage of weapons at the front.  But theMunitions Department  stated that by March of  next  year the supply would justifythe arming of not  less than a hundred  divisions  abroad, leaving a sufficient quantityfor home defence.    13. No special  problem appears in  connection with small-arm  ammunition, andthe arrangements  made for the air service, for anti-aircraft  guns, for  trench-mortarsand hand-grenades,  as well as  for various forms of gas attack, may be regarded asdoing credit to the energy of the Department; but the supplying of the vast volumeof high-explosive and other shells demanded hy the conditions of modern warfare has,as the Government are  aware,  long been a subject of anxiety.  It was stated  by theMinister of  Munitions that, whereas 5,700,000 shells  should have been delivered bythe  1st June last, only  1,500,000 were  in fact  received.  With the present orders,however, the necessary proportion of high-explosive shells should be forthcoming byOctober of this year, and no difficulty exists regarding the proportion of shrapnel;  butit will not be until March 1916 that  the full quota of ammunition for a continuedoffensive will be available.  During the whole of that year a certain proportion ofammunition would have  to come from oversea,  representing the proper margin overthe standard, quota fixed in each case for the various calibres of gun per day.  The priceof this imported ammunition is  high, and its transit involves risk, to say nothing of theobjection that may be felt to dependence on a foreign country, however well disposed,for such warlike necessaries.   But to produce in  this country the entire  supply ofguns and other munitions required even for our own forces  would  open up importantcivil and military difficulties, even if it were otherwise proved possible.    14. Mr. Lloyd George informed us that the labour  position is exceedingly trouble-some for his Department. In their belief the workmen now employed could turn out bysteady labour 25 per cent, more than they do.  The Committee are of opinion that anincrease o  output reaching this  percentage may be brought about by  an  extendedsystem of conference between employers and representative workmen, to consider suchmatters as the application to existing machinery of labour-saving devices ; the furtheradmixture of unskilled  with  skilled  labour, the  latter being devoted largely tosupervision  and training;  and the amount of notice that  workmen  should receivebefore changes in methods of working are introduced.  The Committee  appreciated
the advantage of adding to the number of controlled establishments ;  and they learnedwith satisfaction that  the  War Office had  agreed to hand over to  the  MunitionsDepartment the charge of Woolwich and the other Government factories.    15. But it is not held by the Department that any such steps, however  successful,will of themselves enable the needs of the Army to be  met. In their opinion  some40,000 more  skilled men are at present required to meet the existing  unsatisfieddemand of establishments engaged on munition work.  In addition,  30,000 to 40,000skilled men will be needed  during the next few months to enable  the new programmeof guns and ammunition to be carried out by the dates  named  by the contractors, or20,000 to 30,000 if  the more modest expectations of the Munitions Office are to befulfilled.  In  addition to these some 150,000 unskilled workers  may be  needed.  Onexamination of the capacity of the 100,000 munition volunteers  and the practicabilityof transferring them, it seems that not more than 6 per cent, of the number can inany case  be  available,  being a figure very far short  of  the  minimum  demanded.Indeed, an important Committee of representative men of business have concludedthat no further  drafts  ought to be made upon these volunteers, and have  passed aResolution calling attention  to the urgent  necessity of devising a fresh  scheme forsecuring skilled labour  for  the  manufacture  of  munitions.  The  Department  alsoobserve that the paucity of  night-shifts worked by the machines is a further  evidenceof scarcity of labour.    16. The  conclusion  reached  by the  Munitions Department is this,  that  afterexhausting all  the  aid   that can be  hoped  for  from (a) the  services  of munitionvolunteers, (b)  the  importation of  skilled  labour from abroad, and  (c)  the  betterdistribution of skilled and  unskilled workers, a shortage will remain which  can onlybe corrected by recalling from  the  colours  a  number of skilled engineers and otherartisans who  have joined them.   According to the estimate, about  a  quarter of amillion men were recruited  in the first year of the war from thirteen trades, of  whichmany members, though by no means all, would be skilled workers in munition-making.Even after a special check was applied last  May to such recruiting,  some 26,000 menwere enlisted up to the end of July.   The Committee are convinced from these figuresthat a large number of skilled workers are employed at the front  not in military  dutiesrequiring technical  knowledge, such as the  care of motor  transport, &amp;c,  but in theordinary routine of the private soldier.   The correction, however, of this faulty systemis no  easy matter.   In France, where all  the  men  in  question are  under  militarydiscipline,  manufacturers have been authorised to retain them when mobilised, and tocomplete their establishments, either by asking for individual men whenever serving,unless technically employed in the army, or by applying to the Central Administrationfor workers from a  general list in  their possession.  It is stated that some 170,000men have  been  thus  released, of whom 140,000 are combatant  soldiers and 30,000belong to auxiliary military services, but this figure appears to include  an unspecifiednumber of miners who have returned to the pits.  It is believed by Mr. Lloyd Georgethat in our Army, while a certain proportion  of men are unwilling to  leave their units,difficulties are interposed by commanding officers and  others in the way of others whowould  be prepared to return,  apart from the^ direct discouragement by the  War Officeof any attempt to secure men not only from the armies in the field,  but from those athome  that have undergone  a great  part  of their  training.    The  1st,  2nd,  and3rd Armies are  regarded as  entirely barred for this purpose, it being stated that of70,000  names   given  by  employers  of skilled men,  not less than  55,000  wereunapproachable.  The  Committee are of opinion  that it is necessary to take furthersteps  towards the release  of some  of these soldiers, but  that the  method must beconsidered in connection with the entire question of compulsion.Air Service and the Navy.    17. Before examining this, it is necessary to deal with the services other  than thethe land forces,  so far as the facts  affect this  enquiry.  Of the  air service,  whetherconnected with the  Navy or  Army,  it may be said that  the  present and prospectiveoutput of  aircraft is satisfactory, the  Admiralty hoping  to have  in possession in sixmonths from now,  allowing for  wastage at the current rate,  2,150 aeroplanes  andseaplanes,  in addition  to about 60  airships  and some 40  kite-balloons,  without anyallowance for wastage in these two  classes, the Army 1,418 aeroplanes,  after making aliberal allowance for wastage.  The number of men employed  in the actual service,or in the manufacture of aircraft, is  not such as to  affect  seriously either  the  problemof recruiting or that of munition making, although the proportion of skilled to unskilledworkei s is probably higher in the aircraft industry than in any other.
     18. As regards the Navy, the possible competition, with the Army for the delivery of heavy guns has been mentioned above (paragraph 10).  The number of men borne in the Navy and all its allied services is  given  as 278,340; that of men employed in the home dockyards as 54,145.   In neither case does there seem to be any probability. of an extended demand in the immediate future.  Not more than 50,000 additional men are likely to be asked for in this financial year on Vote A., and this only to retain a considerable unexpended margin. The forthcoming programme includes the completion and arming of first class  ships already laid down, but the new construction is confined entirely to smaller craft and ships of the  new  types.  Similarly with guns, the vast bulk of the orders are for those of 4-inch or less calibre a fortunate circumstance, in view of the unprecedented demands by the Army for heavy artillery.  Of ammunition the only type to cause any concern  is that of  high-explosive shell for. heavy guns  12-inch, in particular where for the time being the margin is  small, the shortage being due to special circumstances which will not recur.  Having regard to the present stagnation in mercantile shipbuilding, the Admiralty have thought it wise to encourage the laying down  of  merchant  ships  on  Government  account in  such yards  as Armstrong^, though not in Government dockyards. Recruiting.    19. In paragraph 8 above the approximate figures were stated of the British Army as it exists at present, with its prospective strength on the  1st April, 1916.  Looking back  to the  first days  of the  war,  the strength  of the forces  after mobilisation, including  the Territorial Force, was somewhat less  than  700,000, including about 234,000 Regulars, 145,000 Regular Reserve, 56,000 Special Reserve, and 256,000 Terri- torial Force.  Since then, about 1,325,000 recruits have been  posted to regular units, and about 563,000 to Territorial units.  When to this total of 2,600,000 is added the .280,000 claimed for the Navy, it needs but a small further addition from miscellaneous services to produce an aggregate of three million men who have offered themselves to the country. The war wastage from the Army  has already been mentioned ; but the Committee were given the startling figure of 245,457 as the wastage at home from the above force of some 1,888,000 men.   It was explained that a considerable part of this total dates  from the quite  early days of the war, when regular medical  inspection was impossible,  and a large  number of unfit men were  therefore enlisted,  and that now the proportion  of discharges is very much less ;  but the fact is  in: itself significant.   The number of soldiers in respect of whom separation allowances are being  paid is given at 850,000, other  allowances being made to about 20,000  married  men  not separated from  their wives.  Dependants&apos; allowance is paid to  710,000.    20. It is not easy to draw  any special conclusion from  a  study of  the numbers and percentages of recruits  enrolled from  the different counties in  the United Kingdom. Those from Scotland are almost uniformly high ; the Irish figures, for reasons familiar to the Cabinet, are as a rule low.  In England and Wales no patent distinction appears between urban and rural counties,  or industrial and agricultural communities.  The inducements and deterrents have alike evidently been sporadic and uncertain.    21. The monthly and weekly figures  have also varied greatly throughout the wholeperiod.   For  the seven  weeks ending on  the 14th August current,  the number-averaged about  19,000, with an increasing tendency.  All these men are enlisted forservice anywhere.    22. Taking the Army  nowr  abroad  plus the Territorial Force at home and theformations publicly announced as the New Armies,  amounting in all to  70 divisions,more or less, the War Office inform us that the number of effective recruits would haveto be raised to at any rate 25,000 per week in order  to  maintain this force  at  itsproper establishment throughout  the year 1916.  Unless,  therefore, at least this weeklyaddition is forthcoming, the prospect of increasing our Army in Flanders or elsewherein the course of the spring is materially impaired, since a number of those alreadyenrolled in one or other of the new Armies would be required to replace casualties.The Limits of Recruiting.    23. It now becomes  expedient to  study the limitations which in  this countryprevent the enrolment in the Army of all men of military age, whatever  system may be applied to securing their services.  In the first  place, we maintain a  larger Navythanany other Power, and its strength has been  considerably increased,- particularly insubsidiary directions,  in  this war.  The claims of the Munitions Department havebeen stated above, and they cannot be ignored.  The work of the Central  Governmentdetains a certain number of men of militarv age,  though many pf this class are serving      [1112]                           *  &apos;                              0
    All belonging to the first two of these categories and the due proportion retainedof the third must be regarded as directly doing Government service in the war.    24. But there is also a large class of men whose inclusion in  the Army  mightprove positively disastrous  to our  prospects  of  victory-those who are needed tomaintain the industries of  the country either for domestic consumption or for export.Their number is variously estimated by competent observers, but of certain claims toexemption no  doubts  are  entertained.  It is  hoped that when the returns for theNational Register are  examined it may be possible to check  the existing calculationsto some purpose ; and, pending the receipt of those papers, neither the War Office northe Local Government Board have been willing to hazard &quot;any conjectures of their own,although the latter Department are prepared to find that the Board  of Trade figures,now to  be  described, underestimate  the  possible drafts  that can be made on men ofmilitary age.    25. In the statement handed in by Mr. Runciman a number of trades and professionsare grouped together according-to a general estimate of the reduction in number whichin each class  the public interest will  permit.   This estimate is partly based on theintrinsic value of the  trade or business  to the  country,  and partly  upon the knowndepletion which it has already suffered.  At the head of the list stand a number ofimportant occupations from which, in the opinion of the Department, no more/.recruiting-should be permitted.  It should be noted that in these and all other cases,  only two-thirds of the total number, including those  who  have  already joined, are reckoned asphysically fit,  a proportion which seemed, to the  Committee somewhat  too discouraging.In France, we were informed, about 27  per  cent, do not join, of whom  7 per cent, areexempted, 16 per cent  postponed, and  4  per cent, allotted to the auxiliary services.The above-mentioned  occupations, in addition  to industries specially  suitable formunition-making, such as engineering,  shipbuilding, &amp;c,  and to  Central Government,include others as important as mining,  railways, chemicals,  leather and  bootmaking,and the woollen and  cotton trades.  Those from  which about a third  of  the existingbalance might be forthcoming are the timber and furniture trade, the glass and potterytrade, and transport (other than railways).  A half might  be available from a numberof occupations, such  as the hewing and tobacco trades, quarrying and stone, domesticservice, the commercial class, and  the  large  trading  body known as dealers, theavailable balance of whom is put at  half a million.   From the building trade it isthought that the whole balance of 250,000 might properly be enlisted.    26. There are some notable  omissions from these   groups, the Board of  Tradehaving been unwilling to suggest a figure either for the agricultural industry or for theemployees of local bodies, and the two Departments specially concerned having preferredto  wait for the National Register.  Of  the professional class, the Board of  Tradeconsider that about one-fourth of  the  remaining balance might join ; but  over andabove  the  Departmental  enumeration,  amounting  in  all  to  nine  millions  of alloccupations, there must be a considerable number of  persons  of independent means,sons of employers, students, and others  not included ;  consequently the figure of about850,000 available males of military age  belonging to those occupations  enumerated inthe Board of  Trade return falls considerably  short  of  the  actual  total  of possiblerecruits to the Army.  In this connection it may be noted that during the  first twelvemonths of the  war the total number of commissions granted has been 80,000.    27. It is necessary to compare the  conclusions submitted by the Board of  Tradewith the statement of the prospective strength of the Army set out in  paragraphsabove.  &quot;Faking the  figure of  881,000 available recruits  suggested by Mr. Runciman,and assuming a further figure of 455,000  as representing the classes not  estimatedby  his Department, a total is reached  falling short  by some  175,000 of the numberrequired for the maintenance through the year 1916 of an Army of 70 divisions.  Buteven to attain  this deficit, it must be noted that the recruitment of every man specified.in the Board of Trade plan would be  necessary. Mr. Runciman, however, expressedthe view that on the  voluntary system it should be counted as a very fortunate result if50  per  cent, of such possible recruits  could be enlisted.  His evidence, therefore, ifthe limitations imposed by the Board of Trade are to be accepted, either points  to theabandonment  of the declared strength of  the Army, or  to the adoption  of a form ofcompulsion which might be  regarded as  peculiarly invidious, since it would fall uponcertain  classes and occupations with a severity which might  be just in the nationalinterest, but could scarcely be comprehended either by its objects themselves  or bythe fellow-workers in other trades, whose sympathy they would demand.     28. It becomes necessary at this stage to regard the purely financial aspect of therecruiting question, with which the statistics given in the preceding paragraphs are
closely connected.   A decided view was expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequerthat the reservations to general recruiting indicated by the Board of Trade were by nomeans adequate, and that it would be literally impossible to carry on the war unless largefurther deductions from  the  potential fighting forces were made.  This considerationis so grave that the Committee feel that it merits close examination.     29. The statement may be summarised as follows :  The present cost of  the  armyis about 2,000,0002. a day, that of the navy about 600,0001. a day,or over 200,000,0001a year.   The total obligations to the  Dominions and to the Allies incurred  up to theend of 1915 have reached 335,000,0001, and it is anticipated that these liabilities willprogressively increase  rather than diminish. &apos;  On the  other  hand  the forecast ofexpenditure supplied by the Admiralty seems  to suggest hopes  of  a  perceptiblediminution in the calls made by that Department in the course of  next year.     30. The method employed to estimate the  ratio between this huge expenditureand  the necessity for limiting the army was as follows :  Taking the total productionof the  country  and dividing  the  figures by the  number of  persons employed,a calculation supplied to the  Chancellor of  the Exchequer places the product of thelabour of  a man at the  value of 2()0l.   Every million,  accordingly, of this outlayrepresents  the labour of 5,000 men,  and the saving of  every million would permitthe addition of 5,000 men to the fighting  forces or to  any other  national  purpose.The  Committee,  however, are unable  to admit the validity of  this  conclusion, eitheron the ostensible basis of the  calculation, or  in view of the other factors involved.     31. It is generally agreed that so far as external help  is concerned, the  UnitedStates is the only country to be seriously considered ;  and further  that the only meansby which the burden of our indebtedness can be met, whether it be described in termsof labour or not,  are (a) the raising of  a loan, (6 j  the sale of securities, (c) the reductionof consumption  at  home.  In the opinion  of the Treasury, unless  all  these can  besecured, our existing liabilities, to say nothing of those  to  be  expected, exceed ourcapacity  for production,   The possibility  of  borrowing is, in  the opinion  of theDepartment, exceedingly  limited, even though the prospects of an immediate loan of100,000,0001. in  America are not entirely  unfavourable ; nor  in  their view can asystem of  deferred payments for  purchases  in the United States, which  represents adifferent form of borrowing, be practised on a sufficient scale to affect the situation.The  sale of securities  progresses, but. the possibilities  of  this remedy are strictlyconfined.  Nor do they  consider it possible to  bring about such a reduction of  con-sumption  here as  would meet the case,  since  it could  only be effected by drasticmeasures of general confiscation.  Goods, they contend, can only be paid for by goods,and  it is to the  greater  production of goods  that we must  look if the war is to  becarried on,  not  from fear of financial disaster  to the, country,  but because  of thephysical impossibility of obtaining the material means.    32.  The conclusion reached by Mr. McKenna was  that far from looking for furtheradditions to the Army the country ought to  realise that it. may not  be  able  to equipthose that have already been enrolled.   The  Committee are of opinion that while theclosest attention must be  paid to the limits of recruiting and to all necessary exemptionsfor commercial purposes, the Treasury has taken a too abstract view7 of the  position.It is indisputable  in theory that goods can only be paid for  by goods, but like othereconomic  axioms, such as the transferability of labour, or the &quot;certainty that a  manwill buy in the cheapest market, it is only true of large numbers of people and  over  along period of  time.  In  a war such as this, in which the passions and  sentiments aswell  as the interests of mankind  are involved, it is dangerous  to rely too greatly oneconomic maxims.   It has also  once  more  to  be  remembered,  as  in  the past, thattransactions are conducted by individuals not as a rule by nations.   In our opinion,therefore, the forecast that in the course of a strictly limited period the credit of  thiscountry will so completely collapse as  to oblige us to  retire  from the war either  asfighters or guarantors, unless  we largely reduce our fighting strength on  land, is notjustified by the probabilities of the situation.    33.  There would be a  further result,  in itself  less expected, of  adopting theTreasury view, that it would supply arguments  for a system of  compulsory servicemore drastic and general  than any which  the  country is  ever likely to  contemplate.In this  way :  If it were proved that in the interest of the Allied cause  our  bestcontribution was industrial,rather than military, our national conscience would  obligeus to be sure that the contribution was forthcoming to a full extent.  A number of ourpotential soldiers would  be encouraged and  justified in exchanging  the  hardships ofwar for the safer courses of well-paid  if severe work at  home!   This must  in somedegree happen now, but  if it were greatly extended there would  be a strong  demand
for collective compulsion of two kinds :  first that which would ensure that our reducedarmy included  every able-bodied man who could not be industrially employed ;  andsecondly, that which would oblige the largest possible production of  goods.   Failingthis, it would be difficult for a self-respecting Englishman to look a Frenchman or aSerbian in the face.     34. It will be evident  to anybody who examines the foregoing paragraphs of thisReport that, altogether apart from the existing political situation or from any agitationconducted outside, it is necessary for the Government to face the disputed question ofcompulsory service.  Speaking generally, they are in accord with the opinion expressedby the  First Lord  of the  Admiralty in. his  Cabinet Paper of  the 23rd August, that,for the decision  whether  this change  shall  be made or not  made in this  nationalemergency, all  preconceived  opinions  and a  priori views must be.set aside, and  theconclusion  must be reached with  simple regard to the exigencies  of  the war  andthe  achievement  of victory.   They are  also convinced that  any system  of  militaryorganization maintained or introduced during  the war ought  in no way to prejudiceconsideration of the system to be adopted after the conclusion of peace.     35. The considered opinion  of the Army  Council on  the military necessityof  such a  step  must of course carry  the greatest  weight  with  His  -Majesty&apos;aGovernment,  and  the  Committee  therefore   think  it  right  to  include  a  fullstatement  of  Lord  Kitchener&apos;s  evidence   on  this  subject.    The  Secretary   ofState for War informed us  that it would  be  his  duty to  ask Parliament  beforethe end of the  year for a Bill giving him compulsory powers.   The weekly supply ofrecruits was  not  sufficient to  carry out his 70-divisions scheme.   Where  he requires25,000 a week he  was getting 20,000.   In a period when he  should have 1,500,000more men  he would, if voluntary recruiting continues undiminished, have a millionmen.  He told us that the 70-divisions  scheme had been built up out of such resourcesas came to  hand, and  that  its scale had not  been  fixed with regard to  militarynecessities.   Its outline had, however,  been imparted to the French, who  would feelgreatly  disappointed if it were abandoned.  He could not consent to abandon it.   Heregarded 100 divisions  as  the ideal.  He stated, on the other hand,  that  he  saw nomeans at present  of creating any  new formations.  The supply of munitions was  notthe  difficulty :  that would  adjust  itself in time.  The barrier  was the supply ofcompetent officers to lead our men in the held.   Until he could see his way to securethese in greater numbers than at present, he would  not undertake the building up ofnew divisional formations.  If all difficulties  with regard to men and munitions wereremoved, still he did not think it possible at the present time,  to increase the numberof divisions, but it might be so later on.     Lord Kitchener told us that he regretted  the raising of the question of compulsoryservice at the present  time as extremely unfortunate.  He had always intended, ifthe  result  of  the  Registration  Bill  showed  a  considerable  unabsorbed supply ofrecruits, to  ask for compulsory  powers ; but he had hoped  to  do  this on  his ownmotion, on his  own authority, in  his own time,  and to do it suddenly as a measure ofAvar emergency before  men and  parties  had begun to take sides according to theirformer political opinions.   He had Avished to rush&quot; the position, but now  the enemyAvere entrenched and it would be a battle  &quot; across the wire.&quot;  He saw also  the seriousdrawbacks and disadvantages  to a change of system of this kind in the middle of  theAvar.  Nevertheless, the need to get the men must, Avhen the moment came, overcomeall other objections.  .     30. Having summarised the statements which were elicited from him in the courseof our examination, many of  Avhich Avere  given in reply to specific questions, we thinkit desirable to quote textually the essential portions of his statement:         &quot; I greatly regret that there has been this discussion in the country.  I think it is very     premature and could only have done harm, but I  am quite willing to make a short statement     about what my views are with regard to  compulsory service.  1 would only point out from     what you said about the Chancellor of the Exchequers remarks that we are limited, in the     amount of the military forces that Ave  can place in  the field by other circumstances  than     finance, and therefore it would not be possible for us to go beyond a certain restricted limit.     During a war you can make a certain  number of units, and a certain amount of an army,     but there is a limit to  the process of  production wdiich we all in the War Office recognise.     Supposing the Government  wished to  make  a  very large addition to the army, and  the     Chancellor of the Exchequer said it was all right to do so, &apos; Suppose yourselves to  be a     foreign Power and produce enormous forces in the field,&apos; we could not do it.        &quot;As regards compulsory service I would  only say that at the present time compulsory     service would not enable  us to increase  the number of units we are preparing to put into the     field next Spring. We are limited by other causes than the supply of men.  Calculations,
    however, show that we shall not be able to maintain that force in the field during 1916    without a larger addition to our present number  of recruits than we have any prospect of    obtaining under existing arrangements.  Given  that hostilities continue  during 1916, and    that it is our firm intention to use every effort and put every ounce of our strength into the    war, 1 consider that we shalk have to obtain the men required to meet the wastage of the    increased forces in the  Spring and during 19.16.  Before, however, we give up voluntary    recruiting, which  produces approximately&apos; 20,000 men a week, with which, and with ouv    present numbers we could probable keep 1,000,000 men inthefieldcluringl916, it is evidently    essential that Ave should know what number of men under any new system would be available    for the army after duly supplying other necessary services in the country. These numbers can    only be obtained from the returns of the Registration Act, and it would be, in my opinion, very    unwise before the result of that Bill can be examined, and a concrete and practical plan worked    out for the  future supply  of men for. the army to attempt to change our present recruiting    methods which give us about 1,000,000 men a  year.  There are, of course, grave objections,    during the time of war to change our  system of military  service, and the  introduction of    compulsion  would possibly affect the morale  of our foroes.  But  these and other reasons    should not  prevent us, in my opinion, if the men are available, from doing our utmost to    put the full  armed strength of this country into this struggle.  Those are the observations    1 have to make on compulsion.&quot; .    37. Pending the examination of the Register, there was unwillingness on the partof the War Office  and of the Local Government Board to give a definite opinion onpossible methods of devising a system involving compulsion.  The latter Departmenthave refrained from framing any scheme, but it appeared from Mr. Long&apos;s evidencethat he would  favour in the first instance a definite pronouncement of the size of theArmy required, next consider what number of workers  are needed for supplying thatArmy, and then ascertain  what number is required for carrying on the  other necessaryindustries of the country, giving a preference, in case of doubt, to the requirementsof the Army.   These  facts w-ould be  ascertained  by a Central Board in London,presided  over  by a Minister, and working through  Local Committees covering  largeareas,  and including  representatives of different Departments  and  interests.   It  ishoped that thus the friction might be best avoided, which is the  obvious  danger of anyexecutive  action dealing wdth the lot of individuals.    38. In conclusion, the Committee desire to observe :     That  in view of the military position on both of the principal fronts, and of theexpectations existing in the minds of our French  Allies since the Calais conference,Ave should make every  effort to maintain the Army throughout 1916 at  a  strength  of70 divisions ;    That  at the present  rate of recruiting the available force will be about 500,000short of the requisite number;    That, in addition  to this, the Minister  of Munitions having stated that 100,000skilled workers of military age, more  or  less, are needed for the services directed byhis Department, a number of men already enlisted ought  to be returned from theranks to the munition shops, but the Committee do  not attempt  to indicate the precisefigure ;    That  the number of refusals to admit to the Army, or of exemptions from servicein the Army, must continue to be large if the necessary  manufacture  of supplies forthe public service and  of commodities for export is to be maintained ;  .    That  the  Government  accordingly have the following courses open to them, fromwhich a choice must be made at an early date:     (a.) To maintain  the Army  under the  present recruiting  system at about its           present  strength, employing the men enlisted  for the later units as drafts,.           and avoiding the creation of further new formations.  This course appears           to  involve  an explanation to the ^French Government that recent enquiry           makes it plain to us  that we are not capable of maintaining 70 divisions           in  the field, and also of financing the wrar ;  and the  further statement to           them either (1) that  we are prepared to do either one or the other, as  they           prefer, but not both, or (2) that our credit continues to be at their disposal           as  before, but no addition can be made to the forces.    (b.) To endeavour to  increase the supply of recruits on the voluntary basis by           informing the public in this country of the  main facts established by this           enquiry, including the extent to which the French Government are entitled           to  expect us  to  contribute  70  divisions;  and  either  (1)  trust that the           explanation will produce such an increase as  is necessary, or (2) announce           that, unless it  is  promptly forthcoming,  some  method  of compulsory       [1112]                                                              D
      selection will be instituted at a given date in order to supply the balance.      This course in either case seems to involve severe restrictions on recruiting      to prevent further depletion of the necessary services.(c.) The  institution as  soon  as  possible of some form  of  compulsory service,      confined to the period of  the war.   It would then have  to  be decided      whether (1) compulsion should be for service in any part of the world or      be limited to service at home; (2) whether it should be confined to the      naval and military services, or extend to actual Government work  of  all      kinds or some kinds ; (3) whether it should embrace what has  been  styled      &quot; National Organisation,&quot;  covering  almost  every field of activity.  It      would also have to be  considered whether  the  choice should&apos;  fall on the      individual in respect of his age, or of his occupation, or  by the chances of      a ballot.

WE have signed the report drawn up for us by the Chairman of the CabinetCommittee.   W7e agree  with the tendency of  its pronouncements on the variousmatters of fact and policy  with which it deals.   We  recognise its value  as  acomprehensive survey of the course of our enquiry, and as a record of much importantinformation.  We do not feel conscious of any division in principle between our viewsand those set forth in the report, so far as it goes.   But it would not have been possiblefor us to have signed it if it had remained the sole presentation of the views of theCabinet Committee.  We conceive that  the times are so grave, and the crisis of ournational fortunes so  urgent,  that it is our duty to set forth  in explicit terms theimpression  made upon us by the evidence which we have taken,  and  to  offer tothe Cabinet,  as  definite  recommendations,  the  conclusions to which we have come.WTe  have  therefore  decided  to  present  a  supplementary  memorandum.  The twodocuments  are not contradictory, and we venture to hope that both may be studied byour colleagues.    The facts and figures quoted, where thfjy were not given in evidence before us,have been officially supplied by the various departments of the War Office concerned.   I.-Hostile and Allied Armies.  II. Our Own Armies. Ill Numbers and Wastage. IV. rKecruiting.  V. Supply of Munitions. &quot;VI. Supply of Labour. VII. The Statement of the President of the Board of Trade.VIII.-The Statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. IX. The Statement of Lord Kitchener.  X.-Summary of Conclusions.                       I. HOSTILE AND ALLIED ARMIES.    The Cabinet Committee were  not  bound  by any formal  reference, but, aftercareful consideration of  all the circumstances, we came to the conclusion that  themost practical question for us to answer, in the first instance, was the following :     What is the number of  divisions Great  Britain should maintain in contact withthe enemy during the year 1916 ?    We considered that every effort should be made to finish the war in that year,and that an attempt to carry our calculations into periods more remote would be too
 speculative to be of any  real utility.  &quot;We  therefore decided to approach  the  above question along the following three successive lines of enquiry :     First:  What number of divisions are  required  by the  military situation during        the year 1916 ?    Secondly: How many can we equip  and supply with munitions in the same        period; and                                             .        -    Thirdly : How many would it be wise, having regard to economic and other needs,        for us to maintain ?    We examined  first of all  the resources in man power of the belligerent States and the armies which they would be capable of maintaining  in the  period  in  question. We obtained from the General Headquarters in  Erance and from the War Office independent estimates, which are the best available.  The War Office  figures show that Germany and Austria-Hungary have at present, after allowing for losses of over 4,250,000, not less  than 14,800,000 males fit  for and liable to service.  Within  the last few days the  Germans have increased this total  by raising the age to 54 and abolishing the medical disability.   Although these measures indicate strain, they also show determination to use their great resources to the utmost, and they provide a large increase of  those, resources.   The raising  of the  age alone is calculated  by the War Office to add 1,670,000 men who are fit to  the numbers liable  to serve.   In face of this, there seems to be no  reason  to  doubt the ability of  these Empires,  so far as men are  concerned,  to maintain  in  divisional  formations  in the field during  the whole of 1916 the numbers estimated by the War Office, namely: Germany, 3,500,000; Austria-Hungary,  1,500,000; total, 5,000,000.  It may  wrell  be that the  Austrian figure can be exceeded under the pressure of German organisation  and authority.    The military power of Russia must  be measured by&apos;rifles available.  The War Office estimate  states that in April 1916  Russia&apos;should possess 1,750,000 modern military rifles, upon which basis an army of 2,300.000 could  be maintained, of which 200,000 would be required  for the  Caucasus.   The course of events is, however, fast reducing these resources.  It is not possible at  the  present time to forecast what the military value of Russia in 1916 may be, or  whether she will  be able to keep the field. But we think  that  the most favourable assumption wdiich may be entertained is that Russia should contain during 1916 1,500,000 German and Austrian troops.    Ihere is  no reason to  suppose  that Italy, unless a great offensive is undertaken against her, will be able to contain  more than 500,000 Austrian and 100,000 Germantroops during 1916.                   *  .    There would,  therefore, be available for  service, either in the  western theatreor  elsewhere,  2,900,000 German  and Austrian troops.  Against this, Erance will beable  to  maintain  1,800,000  men.   The   Central  Powers  will therefore have  asuperiority  of 1,100,000  men,  apart  from any contribution wdiich Great Britainmay make.   Great Britain  should therefore maintain 1,100,000 men (apart from any employed against  Turkey)  in order to produce a bare  equality  of  forces.   It  isobvious, however, that a bare  equality offers no means of assuming the offensive or ofclearing the territory of Erance  and Belgium from  the  invader, nor does it provideagainst much larger numbers of the enemy  being liberated for service in the West bythe possible collapse of Russia.    The Central Powers  possess three great advantages over the Allies.  First, they are on interior lines.   Secondly, they have  taken up strong defensive positions in the cnemy&apos;s territory.  Thirdly, they have unity  of purpose  and  action.  They can,  if they choose, at  any time stand on  the  defensive  on two of their  three fronts andrapidly transfer their whole balance force to the third.    The War  Office estimate that Germany has  at present 171 and Austria 69 divisions in  the field; total  240.   Germany is  credited bv  the  War  Office with an intention to  raise her  army in contact from 3,000,000  to  3,500,000 by  the 1st April next year. For more than a year  the  Germans have  spoken  of their army as one of 100 army corps, i.e., 200 divisions; and there is no  doubt that this is the ideal  towards wdiichthey are working. *    Assuming, however, that  the German  and Austrian  formations do not increase &quot;eyond their present numbers, they will dispose of 240 divisions in the spring  of19m   If  24 of these are  used  to hold  Italy,  and 70  to  hold  Russia, there/ willremain 156  divisions for  the  western theatre  or elsewhere.   The Erench have 100A list was actually published last year showing the  headquarters of 100 army corps to whichlas presents should be addressed,
divisions.   A British army of 100 divisions,  including  colonial divisions (of which10  might  be employed against  Turkey) would  therefore give us a  superiority of31  divisions.   A 70-divisions army, less 1$*  produces  practically  an equality:160 divisions against 156.   A 50-divisions army, less 10,  would leave us  inferiorby  16 divisions.   In  these circumstances, a  100-divisions army would  not be  inexcess of our  needs,  and certainly  every division up  to 100 that we are  able toform should be put in the field.                             II- OUR OWN  ARMIES.     It is next necessary to consider the scale and  structure of our own armies now inthe field or in preparation. -     The original Expeditionary Force consisted of six divisions, of which four weresent immediately upon, and the other two at short intervals after, the beginning of thewar.  As  soon as possible a seventh and an eighth division were formed from ourgarrisons  abroad;  and a little later three more divisions (27th, 28th, and 29th)  fromour garrisons in India.   All these were composed  exclusively of troops of the regulararmy and  its reserves as they existed before the war.  To them may be added the twoIndian divisions, consisting partly of British  and partly of Indian troops, and therecently formed Guards  division, making a total of fourteen divisions of professionalsoldiers, hereinafter called &quot;regular&quot; divisions.     Simultaneously  with the  organisation of these forces, the  expansion of theTerritorial force and the recruitment of  new armies were proceeding.   The fourteenTerritorial divisions  available at  the outbreak of  war were  made each  to produce areserve  division.   Thirty divisions,  hereinafter called &quot; K&quot; divisions,  were raisedeither directly by the War Office or municipally under the War  Office.  Thus thetotal number of divisions (apart from Colonial divisions) which have been formed orare being formed is to-day seventy-two.    There were formed from these the  1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th  new  Armies,  eachcomprising six &quot; K &quot; divisions, of which  the 4th and 5th new Armies are municipallyraised, and the 5th Army has  three  complete and three  partially formed divisions.The  6th new Army is a  paper  grouping  of six Territorial divisions  now in  Erance,The  7th and 8th  new  Armies  are  each composed of six of  the reserve Territorialdivisions.    These 72 divisions were on the 1st September disposed as follows : 	Home.	France.	Dardanelles.	India.	Total.Regulars Territorials &quot;K&quot; Divisions	13 16	13 6 11	1 4 3	*3	14* 26f 30Add 2 T.F. (broken up) J. Ot ill a * a s a a * * * * * *					70 2					72* This includes the Guards division.f Two Territorial divisions have been broken up.    The divisions serving in France and the  Dardanelles have been formed  intotwelve Army Corps.    In addition to the above there are two Canadian, 2 Australasian  divisions, andthe Royal Naval Division.  A third Australasian division is now being formed.    There are behind these, first, the garrison troops in the United Kingdom, comprising11,000 officers and 260,000 men, who perform the double function of  guarding ourports  and  training  drafts for  the  armies abroad;  and,  secondly, eighteen  reservebrigades, once known  as the 4th new Army, but now broken up for draft production.They are not yet, however, in sufficient strength to secure a continuous supply.    The requirements of home defence are at present discharged by the twelve second-line Territorial divisions of the  7th and 8th new Armies, with the addition of an extraTerritorial division, of  two extra &quot; K&quot; brigades, and twenty-seven cyclist and thirty-
two provisional battalions.   The total establishment of the force allotted to homedefence should be 340,000.   It is actually 270,000.    Cavalry and mounted troops are throughout excluded from this statement.    The War  Office hope  to  have the  whole of the  above seventy-two  divisions(less three serving in India) abroad by April 1916; and for that purpose, as well asfor the further production of drafts, a system of third-line Territorial units has alreadybeen brought into existence.  These units also are far  too weak to supply the draftsfor the Territorial divisions in the field, which are in consequence  much below theirstrength.    This scheme of armies, together with their draft-producing units, the  garrisonsand home  defence force above described, and provision  for wastage up to the end of1916 will hereinafter be called &quot;the 70-divisions scheme.&quot; ;    It will be seen from Lord Kitchener&apos;s evidence that its scope and  organisationwere imparted  to the Prench Government  and generals in the presence of the PrimeMinister and other British Ministers at the Calais Conference.  Although it may be thatthe undertaking given fell short of a formal pledge, yet there can, in our opinion, be nodoubt and Lord Kitchener&apos;s evidence supports the inference that the Prench willhe legitimately aggrieved if the scheme were abandoned.  They have been encouragedto continue the struggle  with animation in the hopes and prospect of  the presence inone or other of the war  theatres  next year of British armies of 70 divisions.  Andwe  think  it impossible  at  the very time when the Bussian  defeats impose a vastlyincreased burden upon the rest of the Allies, and  expose us all to far greater dangers,to announce to them a large contraction in our anticipated military strength.    So far from the  70-divisions army being in excess  of our needs during 1916, webelieve that a 100-divisions  army would  bear a truer relation both  to the strength ofour enemies and to the exertions of our Al&apos;ies.  But we regard the effectual  fulfilmentof the 70-divisions scheme as indispensable.                         III. NUMBERS AND WASTAGE.    The  Adjutant-General&apos;s  Department  have  calculated  their requirements asfollows:         G2 British division?, with cavalry and line of communication troops, &amp;c,          in the field, approximately     &apos;..     ..     ..      ..      ..  1,350.000        Draft rroducing formations, approximately..     ..      ..      ..    800,000        Hume Defence aud garrisons of ports, approximately ..      ..      ..    20 ),000                  Total     ..     -..    ...     ..      ..      ..  2,350,000    To this total must now be added wastage.                                   J    Confusion arises  from various interpretations of  the expressions &quot;net wastage,&quot;&quot; permanent wastage,&quot; &amp;c, and it is important to have precise definitions.   &quot; Netwastage &quot;is therefore  taken to mean all  men  permanently lost to the army from anycause, plus the numbers temporarily lost through being in hospital at a given moment.This is the basis adopted by the Adjutant-GeneraTs Department, to whom the questionnaturally presents  itself,  &quot; How many  men must we replace ?&quot;   The numbers inhospital are, in fact, a very important resource from  which replacements are drawn,but while in hospital or convalescent they are at any given moment as effectually lostto the fighting line as if they were killed &quot;or prisoners.    This form of &quot;net wastage&quot; is  quite different from the  &quot;permanent wastage&quot;caused  to the military manhood of the belligerent nations  by men finally eliminatedfrom the w\ar, and this is better called &quot; permanent loss.&quot;    Both  &quot;net  wastage&quot;  and &quot;permanent  loss&quot;  are again distinct from &quot; grosswastage,&quot;  i.e., the total aggregate  of  casualties without  reference  to  recoveries.    The  Adjutant-GeneraPs  Department state that  the &quot;net wastage&quot; for the firstnine months of the war. was 13 per cent, per month, and that  it will&apos; probably exceed10 per  cent,  per month of the troops  in contact with the enemy, as distinct fromthe line of communications.         .                       .     &apos;    On this  basis  the total &quot; net wastage &quot; from the beginning of  the war up to theend of  1916 is estimated by the Adjutant-General at  approximately 1,900,000 men.    Ihese  figures, howover, are calculated on a basis of maintaining  62 Britishdivisions  only.  In.order  to  reach the  total of  70 divisions the Adjutant-GeneraFsdepartment   include   5  Colonial,  1 Naval,  and the  2 British  Indian divisions.      [1U2]                                                            E
There are, therefore, 8  divisions  now  in process  of  formation unaccounted for.  Ifthese divisions are to be put  in the field, wastage will have to be calculated on themtoo,  and it is presumed  that some divisional formations would be required as acentral  force for  home defence  in addition to  the garrisons and training depots.On the  other hand, we think that the forecasts of the Adjutant-General&apos;s Departmentare framed on a  liberal  scale.  It seems probable that the rate of wastage will notin fact  prove so high over the much larger armies we contemplate in  the future asin the comparatively small force which we have hitherto maintained in the field ; andthat, if  the war  is prolonged, the number of recoveries  from  the ever-increasinghospital totals will increase.   It is  clear in any case that if the war were prolongedafter the last day of 1916 a purely arbitrary date-the Adjutant-General would havenot only 800,000  men in the draft-producing formations, but also a large total ofhospital patients and convalescents, a considerable proportion  of whom would becomeagain available.    We therefore think that 4 to Ai\  millions may be assumed to be the  total drainupon the population required to  carry  out  the 70-divisions  scheme  to  the full.Lord Kitcheners estimate in his  evidence  is 4  millions.                                IY. RECRUITING.         At the beginning of the war we mobilised             Regulars       ..      ..      ..      ..      ..   234,000            Regular Reserve  ..      ..      ..      ..      ..   145,000            Special Reserve  ..      ..      ..      ..      ..    56,000            Territorial Force  ..      ..      ..      ..      ..   255,000                                                         --691,000         Since then we have accepted recruits for the             Regulars..      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..  1,325,000            Territorials      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..   563,000                                                         --  1,888,000         The net war wastage has been approximately    ..      ..   200,000         The wastage of recruits originally accepted but subsequently          rejected as unfit before their training was completed    ..   247,000                   Total wastage and rejections      ..      ..    ..       447,000    The recruiting records for the last six months  show an average  yield  of 20,000 aweek, but we are informed  by the  Adjutant-General that  this  represents  in aneffective yield  to  our military forces  of  only approximately 17,000  men.   Wewere  informed  bv  the Director-General  of  Recruiting  that  nothing. less  than25,000 a week from now onwards will  suffice  to carry out  the 70-divisions scheme,and  subsequently  by  Lord  Kitchener  that 30,000  a  week would bo   requiredfor part of the  time.  These calculations  take  no  account  of any  men AVIIO may berequired  to  replace  munition  workers  ordered back from  the  army.  Eventhe yield  of  20,000  a week  can  only  be  maintained  by  repeated  canvassingof  individuals  and  by every form  of  social, and  in some  cases  of  economic,pressure upon all classes of men (except actual munition  workers) from  17  to 45,wheth er married  or single,  whether usefully employed or  not,  and whether ornot they can be spared  from their trade or district.  The response  to the  appeal tohonour and duty which has been  made  by the British  people  freely and  voluntarilymay justly be  regarded as  one of  the  most glorious episodes  in  our  nationalhistory.   It has, however, been achieved at an unnecessary cost in national and socialorganisation  and in industrial productivity.  The evidence  which we have receivedfrom  the Board  of Trade and the Treasury shows very clearly that the limit ofindiscriminate recruiting by patriotic appeals and  other methods now employed hasbeen reached, if not exceeded, and that for the future every man who is taken must betaken  after careful regard to his usefulness in  other spheres.   Moreover, though thefigures  supplied to  us  tell no tale, we cannot help  feeling  that there  must be aproportion of persons  of military age and fitness  in every class  to whom all appealsare useless; and a still  larger proportion who cannot by any voluntary effort of theirown free themselves from their family  ties or business obligations.
                          V. SUPPLY OE MUNITIONS.    The Minister of Munitions laid before  us  the facts which are here  summarizedand will have since been confirmed by his Department.    The power to  equip and supply a  given number of  Divisions for service  isgoverned broadly by the following factors:     1.  Guns, field and heavy.    2.  Artillery ammunition.    3.  Rifles.    4.  Machine guns.    5.  Small-arm ammunition.                                    Guns.    Before the war the approved artillery establishment of an Infantry Division was5-1 18-pounders, 18 4&quot;5-inch howitzers, and 4 60-pounders.  It was not customaryto use  heavier guns  in the field, except as part of a siege train.  Since the war thenumber of 18-pounders in a Division has been reduced to 48, and an entirely new andextensive organisation of heavy artillery, i.e., 6-inch, 8-inch, 92-inch, 12-inch, and even15-inch, is in process  of development.    On the outbreak of war we possessed 897 18-pounders and 169 4&apos;5-inch.   By themiddle of October 1914, 600 18-pounders had been ordered.   The Cabinet Committeewhich met in that month increased the total number to over 5,000.   By the end ofthe present  month  (September)  we  shall  have   2,480,  and the  total  number,5,107, will be gradually completed by June 1916.  In addition to the above, there arc228 15-pounders and certain other guns belonging to the Territorial Force useful forhome defence,  and there are 116 13-pounders for horse artillery and as anti-aircraftguns, with others on order making a total of 356.    As the result  of  the  October 1914 orders we shall have  by the end of September1916 approximately 500-4-5-incb  howitzers.  Up to the  31st May, 1915, there hadbeen ordered altogether 782.   The orders placed will eventually raise this total to 1,618,of which 1,000 should be available by March 1916, and the remainder by December 1916.    The conference at Boulogne on the 19th June, summoned  by the  Minister  ofMunitions, revealed the need for  an  immense increase  in our  heavy artillery  asfollows:     60-pounders :  On the outbreak of war we  had 31.  In September we shall have        117.  The total ordered up to the 31st May  was 148.   We have ordered and        expect to have available by October 1916, 800.    6-inch:  86 were available  on  the  outbreak of  war.  16 more had been ordered!        up  to the 31st  May.  The new  orders placed since should yield  560  by        September 1916.    8-inch :  None were available on the outbreak of war.   All are conversions from        naval guns.   Ordered to the 31st May,  23.  Total ordered, 72.    9-2-inch :  Available  on the outbreak of  war, 1.  Ordered to the 31st May, 32.        Now ordered, 300.    12-inch  : 48 should be available in March 1916.    15-inch howitzer:  Ordered by  the  Admiralty in August 1914, 12.  Now avail-        able, 6.  Available in three months, 12.    The execution of the programme of heavy artillery depends entirely upon whethera sufficient  number  of skilled  workmen can  be obtained.   Unless  these  men areavailable, either from the colours or elsewhere, the programme will be delayed.                             Artillery Ammunition.    The expenditure of artillery ammunition  in this war has exceeded all estimatesof all armies.    As soon as the conditions were realised, headquarters demanded 50 rounds per gunper day for 18-pounders.   This could not be met, and it was  agreed that the  standardof supply should be fixed at 17 rounds, which has since been raised to 25.   When this
has been achieved the standard should be advanced, and it is really not necessary atthe present time to assign any upward limit.  Artillery ammunition is a substitute forour soldiers&apos; lives, and even if our guns each had 50 rounds a day, strenuous effortsshould still be continued to increase the supply.    A change has also occurred in the character  of  the shell.   Up to this war  thestaple projectile of field artillery was shrapnel, and high explosive had not been usedto any great extent.   Only 10 per cent, of high-explosive shell was carried in a battery&apos;soutfit.   This has now been raised to  50  per  cent, in the British and  75 per cent, inthe Erench service.    For the 4&apos;5-inch  howitzers the  amount first  agreed  upon  was- 17 rounds eacha day.   Now it is 20 each a clay, 80 per  cent, of it high explosive.    6-inch howitzer: 15 rounds each a day were first agreed to as a basis, which hassince  been raised to 20, all high explosive.    8-inch howitzer:  15 rounds per gun per day, all.high explosive.    9&quot;2-inch howitzer :  12 rounds each a day, all high explosive.    12-inch howitzer  : 5 rounds each a day, since been raised to 8, all high explosive.    Eor the twelve 15-inch Admiralty howitzers, 13,000 shells have been ordered, anddeliveries are rapidly increasing.    The total Erench output in the month of August 1916 is estimated at 2,500,000.The total British output of shell in the  same period was 1,150,000.  Of 5,700,000which  ought to have been  delivered up  to the 1st June, 1916, only 1,500,000 cameto hand.   This failure is not entirely due to labour scarcity.    When the  deficiency in  heavy guns and shell  was discovered, it was necessirypractically to commandeer the wdiole of the machine-making  industry in the country,as well as  to place a 600,000Z. order for machine tools in America.  Had the  ordersfor tools  been placed  earlier, and had the orders for ammunition  been given earlierand been more widely spread,  a more plentiful output would now be forthcoming.    Practically  the whole of the  new heavy gun programme and all  its ammunitionhave been placed in this  country, and a one-third additional ammunition order  hasbeen given in America to create a margin against unpunctual deliveries.    It is  hoped that  by  October  the  high-explosive  ammunition  for both  the18-pounder and the 4&quot;5-inch will be abreast of requirements.    The deficiency in 60-pounder ammunition will not be overtaken until  the earlvpart of next year.    All  heavy  gun  ammunition will, it is anticipated, be up to the requirementsof the  guns then in the  field from March 1916 onwards.    This means that  with a rapidly increasing number of guns a steadily advancingsupply of  rounds  per day  per gun will be  provided.   Prom  March onwards  theammunition problem for the guns available should cease to be a limiting factor.                                     Rifles.    At the outbreak of war wTe possessed  995,0^0  rifles.  Enfiefd was set  to work atits full capacity, producing at the rate of 250,000 a year.  130,000 rifles were obtainedfrom Japan.  Pour orders aggregating 510,000 rifles were placed in America  towardsthe end of the year.   200,000 more were ordered in America in Eebruary, and another200,000 in March this vear.    The Committee  of Imperial Defence was assured in March that these orderswere more  than  adequate to  supply  the  wdiole needs of the army.  It  has,  however,since been found nccessarv to make the following considerable increases:     In April 1^- millions  w:ere ordered  by the War  Office after  discussion  of  theposition by the Treasury Committee.    Another order for  400,000 was  given later in the  month,  and another millionafter the formation of the Ministry of Munitions earlv in June 1916.    The shortage of  rifles resulting from the late placing of the necessary orders isaggravated by the wastage of the army in the  field.  This wastage is calculated at9 per cent, per month.  It had by June already aggregated 118,000.   If  it were  tocontinue at the same rate over the larger armies it is  proposed to keep in the field itwould by June 1916 aggregate 1,312,000,  or considerably more than the total numberof rifles ordered before the big orders of April.  In proportion as the armies increasein size the rate of wastage of rifles will  diminish.  A larger proportion of the troopswill be out of the line, and  this fact, together with increased care,  may somewhatimprove  the position.
    It is estimated we have now about 1,400,000 rifles.&quot;    The deliveries till the end of the year  are  expected  to  he 421,000, from whichwastage must be deducted.    Prom the end of the year to March 1916 the deliveries will be 644,000 from whichwastage must again be deducted.    After March 1916 the big American orders placed in April 1915 begin to mature,and the rifle difficulty will gradually pass away. But even in March our home supplywill only cover the wastage, and we shall be dependent on America for increase.                                Machine Guns.    There are at present  in the field 1,920 British machine guns.  It is estimatedthat 4,409 additional guns  are at present required  to bring the establishment of thearmy in the field up to strength.  Deliveries  are proceeding at about 110 a week,and it is only recently that they have shown  a  balance over wastage.  During themonth of August the total  deliveries  were 484.  By the 31st October the  army willrequire 6,025.   The  probable deliveries will be 1,895.   By January 1916 the armyrequirements will be 8,689, and the deliveries are expected to be  5,591.  By the31st March,  1916, 10,825 are required;  probable deliveries, 9,316.  By the 30th June,1916,  13,000 will be required, and  by that time probably 17,800  will have  beenprovided.   By September 1916 it us hoped we shall have 28,000 machine guns, whichis considerably in excess of any requirements now specified.    The delay in placing orders  for machine guns is the cause of the  present seriousshortage.   Up to the end of the year  1914, 2,040  machine guns were  ordered by theWar Office, and the total ordered, up to the formation of the Ministry  of Munitions inJune, was 3,000.  It has since been found possible to place orders for 30,000 machineguns of approved pattern.  The  position will thus gradually right itself.    About 1,500 machine guns are now completing for the Admiralty, chiefly for theRoyal Naval Air Service.   It seems  probable  that  at least  half of  these could bespared for the army.                            Small-arms Ammunition.                             *    The  total output of small-arms ammunition in July 1914 was 129,000,000.  InAugust  1914  it  was 173,000,000.   In September  186,000,000.   In  December233,000,000.  In March 1915 305,000,000.  In April 371,000,000.    Owing to the slow deliveries  of rifles and machine guns, small-arms  ammunitionwill be abreast of actual requirements from October onwards.    Prom this summary of the evidence of the Minister of Munitions it is apparentthat there have now been ordered: -        1. Pield guns for 100 divisions.        2. Artillery ammunition for 70 divisions.        3. The new heavy gun programme with its ammunition.        4. 4,000,000 rifles.        5. 30,000 machine guns.        6. Sufficient small-arms  ammunition.    The Director  of  Military  Operations  states  that the  supply  of munitionsprovide  for  the  maintenance in contact with the  enemy  of  50 divisions by the31st October, 1915,  of 70 divisions by the 29th February,  1916, and of 100 divisionsby the 31st July, 1916.[1112]F
                            VI. SUPPLY OE LABOUR.    In a second interview with the Minister of Munitions we discussed the labouraspect of his work.    Mr.  Lloyd  George drew attention to the deplorable extent  to  which possiblesources of munition workers have been diminished by injudicious recruiting.  In thefirst year of the war about  250,000 men joined the forces from six groups of tradeslargely engaged in munition work.  Of these, a large number were no doubt employedin clerical and subsidiary occupations.  But, after making all deductions, the numberof skilled mechanics withdrawn is very large.   In May last a definite step was takento check recruiting in munition trades, but, in spite of this, in  the three months fromthe 16th  April to the 16th July over 26,000 men were recruited from the same groupsof trades.    The  production of munitions -is being greatly hampered at the present time forwant of  suitable skilled  labour.  The demands for skilled labour actually notified tothe Board of Trade in the groups of trades engaged on munitions already number over38,000.   In addition, factories would shortly  be ready  for  an additional output of1,000 machine guns a week, requiring  over 10,000  workpeople, of whom 3,000 or4,000 must be  highly skilled.  8,600 men, of whom 2,000 to 3,000 must be highlyskilled, were  required for  further  production of rifles.   Above all these were therequirements  of the new  programme of heavy  guns and  shell,  concerning whichfigures were not yet available.   If additional labour were available, output would begreatly increased by  using night shifts more freely.   Only a comparatively smallproportion of machines were now working night shifts, principally  through the lackof sufficient labour.    Mr.  Lloyd George indicated four ways in which  the demand for labour mightbe met:     1. The transfer of skilled men from private work to  war work.    2.  The release of skilled engineers from the colours.    3.  The importation of skilled workmen from outside the United Kingdom.    4.  The more economic use of skilled tabour by combining it with a larger mixture           of  semi-skilled and unskilled labour, whether male or female.    First : 100,000 war munition  volunteers had been  enrolled.  The  employersof  60,000 of these claimed that they were already  engaged in  war work  or  workof  a character  which should not  be disturbed,  and in at least 40,000 cases, theemployers claim must be  admitted.  Thus the  maximum number  of  volunteersavailable was  reduced to 60,000.   Of these the Ministry of Munitions  state thatthey have found  that  the great majority are  useless for  the  special  types  ofvacancy  Avhich it is desired to fill, either because they are really unskilled men orbecause the skill they possess is  of a different kind from that required, and that onlyabout 10,000 of the war munition volunteers are suitable.    A bonus of 17s. Qd. a week on moving to another district,  which had been one ofthe principal  inducements to enrolment, was a barrier to the employment of the menby  the great armament firms.  Vickers,  for instance, asked for 1,300 men for Barrow.The Munitions Department were prepared to supply them.  The other workmen said&quot; if you  are going to give 17s.  6d. to  these men who come in  as  Avar munitionvolunteers, then we will leave.  We have come from other  districts, too.  We arenot Barrow men.&quot;  In consequence, Vickers did not dare  to take them on.    The  scheme of enrolment  of  war munition  volunteers  has  therefore failedaltogether to produce the necessary supply.    Secondly:  the release of men from  the colours.    Mr.  Lloyd George told us that out of 70,000 names given by employers of skilledmen who had enlisted, 55,000 were either at the front or in the  1st,  2nd, 3rd, and 4thnew Armies, and these were all barred by the War  Office.  Of the remaining 15,000,some were apprentices, some were insufficiently skilled or of the type  not required,and some who Avere  suitable declined to leave the colours.    Two specific instances of the inadequacy of the authority  for the release of  menfrom the colours were given.    A  number of firms engaged on munition Avork in Sheffield  asked for the relief of467 of their most highly skilled and indispensable workers.  The services of these menwould have produced a marked increase  in the supply of essential  munitions.  Only
76 of them were in units from which, under present  arrangements, men could bedrawn ;  and it is  not yet known how many of these 76 will be willing to return.    In another case East Anglia applied for 333  releases in non-barred  units.   TheWar Office issued instructions for the release of 197.  Only 33 reported themselves totheir employers, the remainder preferring to remain with their regiments.    No doubt the regimental pressure was  strong  against  men  leaving even the non-barred units, and  the better the man the more likely was  he to respond to feelings ofmilitary comradeship and the desire to  go to  the front.    Such have been the  difficulties that, although since the 1st July full authorityhas been given from the War Office for the return  of all  men in non-barred units, only2 676 men have yet returned.   There was an evident and natural reluctance, not onlyon the part of the War  Office, but of all branches of the  military organisation, to giveup good men who they have trained while they were still uncertain how and  wdiensuitable substitutes  could be  got.   They said : &quot; Here  wre  are working  to a certainfigure.  We  are  only  getting recruits at  a  certain   rate.  Are  we  to return the100,000 men we have got ?  Why, there is  a  whole army gone.&quot;    The third and fourth methods of obtaining additional skilled labour do not requirefurther evidence here.    The Committee asked the Minister  of Munitions   what form  of compulsion heconsidered necessary.  Would he compel persons  in civil life  to perform  industrialtasks, or to move from one part of  the country to another, or from one branch of atrade to another, or would he rely on compulsion for military service only ?    Mr. Lloyd George said he would take  the same powers exactly as were taken inErance.  He would make everybody between certain ages liable to serve in the army athome or abroad during, and only during, the course of the war.  With this general andbasic authority &quot; you could work the rest all right.&quot;  Men who had already volunteeredcould be ordered to return to the munition factories and  w7ork under civil conditionslor civil pay just  as the 170,000 Erench soldiers  have  been ordered to return.   Themen who had not joined the army would not be moved directly  against their will toa new or different civil  employment.  But  if they  did not  voluntarily do the work forwhich they were needed, and do it satisfactorily, they would be enlisted in  the  army,and used  either  for home defence  or  at the  front.  Once in the  army they  couldsubsequently, if necessary, be ordered to return to their work at  home.    The above  is  a  summary of what  we  gathered  were the Ministers views.Mr. Lloyd  George  concluded  wdth a general statement of his  views on  the subjectof compulsion, which we quote wdth  slight abbreviations :        &quot; You will not get through without some  measure of military compulsion or compulsion    for military service.  The longer you delaj- the nearer you will be to disaster.  I am certain    you cannot get through without it.   I do not believe, for instance, that  you can keep your    armies at the front without it, unless  you are  going deliberately to cut their numbers dnwn    to a figure which will  be inadequate, and which is known to be inadequate in advance.  The    number of men you should put at the front does not.depend on us in the least.  It is going    to depend  on the Germans, and what the Germans are going to do  during the  next three    months in Russia.  If they succeed in putting the Russians out of action during li) 16  as a    great offensive  force, for us simply to keep seventy divisions at the front is suicide.  Not only    that, it is murder, because to  send  a number  of men who  are  obviously inadequate  is just    murdering our  own countrymen without attaining any purpose at all.&apos;&quot;&apos;         *******    Again :        &quot; I do not  doubt at  all that once you begin you  would  find compulsory service would    extend throughout the Empire.  Probably South Africa might demur, but I doubt very much    whether Canada or Australia would.  That means that you  have  got  on the French basis,    and 1 think now on the German basis (i.e.,.after making the deductions  for  necessary home    services) 6,000,000 of  men  available  for  service in this  Empire.  We shall produce    conceivably about 3,000,000 (by voluntary service).  That  gives you a margin of 3,000,000.    You are certain not to want 6,000,000 in the first  year.  We could produce (ultimately)    5,000,000 in the United Kingdom.   The self-governing colonies  could certainly produce    1,000,000 and a little over.  On the French basis of 1 in 9, we can produce between 6,000.000    and 6,500,000.  I have no doubt at all that the Germans will work to  I in 9 before they give    in.  The deduction I draw is this:  Supposing next year you call 1,000,000 of those men to    the colours.  You  would still have 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 left  between the ages of 17 and 45.    That gives you time to organise labour, particularly the labour of women, which is especially    suited to agriculture.  One of the best things that &quot;could result from this war would be the    destruction of  the effeminate idea  that it was degrading  to call upon women to do manual    labour.&quot;    Mr. Lloyd  George went on to examine the military position we should be in next year.-  Hehad already called attention to it in February.  Russia &quot;has at the present only 2,000,000 rifles of
all kinds.  At our rate of wastage, 9 per cent, per month, she would lose 180,000 rifles a month.She was manufacturing 50.000 to  60,000.  Her net  loss was therefore  120,000 a month, apartfrom great captures.  Her first rifles from America should arrive  in January, hut by then, apartfrom great captures, she would have lost 700.000 of her rifles, and would only have 1,300,000left.    The 9 per cent, represented only the ordinary wastage of war in an army which is practi-cally stationary, like ours.  It was probably far greater in an  army retreating like the Russiansunder the constant and tremendous fighting which was in progess on the Eastern front.   Takingonly the ordinary percentage which our own experience on the Western front justified, making noallowance for great captures, or for a continuance of exceptionally severe operations, the Russianrifles will have finished by the middle of 1916, apart from new supplies.   What were  the newsupplies ?  The Japanese proposition was not worth considering.   There was ony America. ByAugust of next year 500,000 rifles would be delivered from America, if anticipations were realised.These rifles would not reach the Russian army before September.  If Petrograd were not success-fully defended, the important machinery for rifle making would have to be shifted and the restblown up, entailing further great loss and delay.    Mr. Lloyd George said that if these facts, to which he had long called attention in writing,continued  to  prove true, the  whole  burden of  the war would fall in  li)16 upon England andFrance.  The French were doing their utmost.  The Italians were &quot; pulling their weight, butthey could  not  do very much.  They were not a very great industrial nation.  Their militarycapacity was practically confined to North Italy.&quot;  The real burden of carrying this war on fortwo years  until the Russians were ready fell upon us, and if we were not prepared to face it weshould be  beaten.  We should be  humiliated and perhaps  the  Empire would be  seriouslyimperilled.        VII. THE STATEMENT  OP THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.     We have been informed by the War Office that, in order to complete and maintainthe  70-divisions scheme to the end  of 1916, 1,750,000 additional  recruits will berequired.   The question presents itself: are they available and, if so, from what sourcescan they be drawn ?  On this point the evidence of the President of the Board of Trademust be considered.  Mr. Runciman has laid before us a series of tables of great valueand  interest.   These tables divide the industry of the  country into four groups, andaltogether account for 9,000,000 males  between 17 and 45 out of a total of  9,700,000.Of these 9,000,000 males,  Mr. Runciman assumes that 6,000,000 are physically fit formilitary service.  He states that 2,500,000 have already joined the forces, leaving atotal of 3,500,000 still eligible if they could be spared.     From the first of his groups, comprising a total of 1,875,000 males, with a balanceof 750,000 fit for military  service not yet  joined, Mr. Runciman  states that no moremen can be spared.     From the second  group, comprising 2,250,000 males between 17 and 45,  with abalance of 850,000  fit  for military service, he considered that no more men could bespared from mining and clothing, and left it to the Board of Agriculture and the LocalGovernment  Board to  express  their views about agricultural  labour  and LocalGovernment servants.     From the third group,  comprising 1,500,000 males between 17 and 45, with  abalance of 800,000 fit for military service, he estimated  that, without serious harm,we could  spare from &quot;furniture,  timber, &amp;c,&quot; &quot;glass  and  pottery,&quot; and  &quot;transportother than railways,&quot; a total of 140,000 men more; but no more from, the other tradesincluded in this group.     From the fourth group, comprising 3,375,000 males between  17 and  45, with  abalance of 1,300.000 fit for military service, he estimated that without serious harmbeing done to  our  foreign  trade or in the equipment of our forces, we could spare, inaddition to those already joined, from                   The building trade   ..      ..       ..      ..  250,000                  Brick, stone, and quarries     ..       ..      ..   25,000                  Brewing and tobacco ..      ..       ..      ..   37,000                  Paper and printing   ,.     ..       ..      ..   27,000                  Professional ..      ..      ..       ..      ..   30,000                  Domestic    ..      ..      ..       ..      ...   62,000                  Oommercial ..      ..      ..       ..      ..   60,000                  Dealers, &amp;c. ..      ..      ..       ..      ..  250,000Total   ..      ..      ..      ..  741,000     Thus the  President of the  Board  of Trade indicated  a total  of  881,000  menavailable for future  enlistment after  passing in review a  total male population  ofmilitary age of 9 millions.
     To this must he added those who could he spared from agricultural labour, (say) 200,000; and the number of Local Government servants (say) 30,000. &apos;   &apos; There might also be added all the available persons  among the 700,000 males of military age who, having no recorded occupation, are not included in the Board of Trade survey.  Applying the same standard  of  fitness to-this class, there should be 450,000 fit for military service.   Of these a large proportion have, however, already joined the forces, either in the ranks or as officers, to whom  no less  than 80,000 have been granted commissions during the first year of the  war.  No  figures are. available in regard to this class, but wre think it a fair assumption that  at  least one-half have already joined the forces, leaving a possible balance available of 225,000..     Thus, proceeding on the Board of Trade basis and  completing their survey from other sources, there would appear to be a total aA^ailable of 1,336000.  This total falls short of the  number required to carry out Lord Kitcheners 70-divisions  scheme by approximately 175,000 men.     To obtain the total of 1,336,000 it would, of course, be necessary  to  take every man of the classes specified by the President of the Board of Trade as being available. This could clearly not be done by any system of voluntary  recruiting.  On - this, point Mr. Runciman expressed the following opinion: &quot; I should think if you got half you ought to count that as a very fortunate result.&quot;  On this assumption the number that could be obtained on the Board of Trade basis by voluntary enlistment would be reduced to 668,000, and the deficit on Lord Kitcheners 70-divisions scheme, up to the end of 1916, would be increased to 843,000.   In  other words, the present rate  of  recruiting at 20,000 a week might continue for eight months, i.e., to the end of March, and would then stop altogether at the very moment when the full army of seventy  divisions hadbeen placed in contact with the enemy, and wdien the wastage would be on the largest scale; or alternatively, as is much more probable, the recruiting among  these strictlylimited classes would produce a lesser number, say,  10,000  a week up to the  end of 1916, as compared  with the 25,000 a week estimated by the War Office as necessary tomaintain the army in the field.     It is clear, therefore, that within the  limits fixed by the President of the Board ofTrade,  and proceeding  by voluntary enlistment, it will not be possible to carry outLord Kitchener&apos;s scheme of seventy divisions, and that  the number would have to bereduced to  approximately fifty divisions,  the  balance  being broken up to  supplywastage.     It is also clear that if the limits of enlistment which Mr. Runciman prescribes areto be observed by the recruiting officers, their task will become an impossible one.    Prom this point of view, if the  seventy divisions were  to be  even approximatelymaintained, Mr. Ruuciman&apos;s argument would appear to lead directly, if unconsciously,to compulsory military service within the  limited classes available.  If these are theonly men wdio can  be spared, all must certainly go, and even if all go they would nothe sufficient.     But to reason  thus would be to make one false point on the top of another.  Weconsider that eligibility for military service cannot be governed solely or even primarilyby occupation.  The exclusion by occupation of nine tenths of the population of malesof military age from  the  obligation-or even the risdit-of military service, and theconcentration of all efforts upon the remaining limited classes, would be invidious andimpossible :  and this would be equally  true whether the  method  employed wasvoluntary or compulsory.  Take, for instance, a  trade such as  the building trade,which has already contributed 176,000 men to the forces out of a total physically fit of440,000.  While leaving nine-tenths of the male population of military age undisturbed,to draw from the building trade a further 250,000 men,  as proposed, would, if effectivevoluntary methods were  employed, be a persecution :  and, if compulsion were  used, agross injustice.     We consider, on  the other hand, that the prime qualification  for military serviceshould be age, in the sense of youth and  physical fitness.   Whether compulsory orvoluntary methods are employed, those who should first  be taken are those under 30,and those over 30 should only be taken when the vital needs of the State cannot besatisfied by younger men.  This is a rough division, but the principle which wre affirmis that the duty to  serve is at its highest  from 20 to  30, and that it decreases year byyear thereafter until at 45, or at the latest at 55, it passes away altogether.  We would therefore approach the  President of  the  Board of  Trade&apos;s industrial  groups by a different method than that of arbitratory inclusion or  exclusion in the military sphere. In the case of men under thirty the presumption would be that all should serve unless a serious reason, public or private, to the contrary could  be  shown in each individual       [1112]                                 ^                           G
case; and that above 30 the tendency should be gradually reversed, the older men notbeing taken if useful employment can  be found for them at home, unless the needs ofthe State leave no alternative.  We consider also that throughout the whole recruitablefield the unmarried should be taken before the married man.  We deem it a disasterthat no less than 820,000 men now serving, out of a total of 2,500,000, or considerablymore than  one-third, should be married.  We think that the enlistment of  marriedmen is unduly stimulated by the separation allowances which have been rightly given,that the burdens  of  the  State in  payments to widows and orphans will be vastlyincreased in future years from this, cause, that the sum of misery is  unnecessarilyaggravated, and that an  avoidable injury is caused to  the family life of the nation,profound in character and irreparable in consequence.  We conceive that it would notbe difficult to take the trade groups of  the President of  the Board of Trade and cross-grade them by the standards of age and circumstance in such a way as to draw thewhole  number of  men required  to maintain the 70-division scheme, with infinitelyless hardship or dislocation than would  be involved in the method  of  wholesaleexclusion or inclusion by  occupations which has been suggested to us.    We shall refer to this aspect of  the  voluntary and  compulsory systems afterundertaking an examination of the evidence placed before us by the Chancellor of theExchequer.         YIII. THE STATEMENT OF THE CHANCELLOR OF  THE EXCHEQUER.    The argument of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was as follows :     He took a Board of Trade estimate that there were 14,000,000 men and 6,000,000women a total of 20,000,000 workers  employed in the industries of the country,and that these by  their labour  produced at the present time 2,400,000,000/. a year.Dividing the number of workers into the total product, he obtains the figure of 120/.as the annual output of a worker.  But, as his argument is intended to bear upon thenumbers of men available for military service, he converts  the  output  of the  workerinto the output of the male, and he states the  product of a  male at 200/. a year,throwing the women and children in as &quot;an adjunct to man-power.&quot;  He thus statesthat a unit of  man-power, by Avhich he means a mans labour plus his share of femaleand child labour, amounts to 200/. a year.    Taking  this figure as his standard, he approaches the present expenditure  on theAvar.   The army  is costing  2,000,000/. a day, or 730,000,000/.  a year.  The navy, heinforms us, is  spending 600,000/. a day, or upwards of  200,000,000/.  a year.  Ouradvances to our  Allies and Dominions approximate to 1,000,000/. a day,  havingreached to date a total of 335,000,000/.    The total Avar  expenditure of  the country is thus stated at 3,600,000/. a  day. or1,314,000,000/. a year.  Dividing this by 200, i.e., the unit of man-power (so-called),he shows that we are  devoting  to the  war the labour  of 6,570,000 men who  areengaged on tasks just as valuable to the cause of  the Allies as  if they  were actuallylighting  in  the  field,  and  in  some  cases  more  valuable.   Pursuing  this lineof thought,  he  pointed  out that  if  we  had no navy  we could put  anothermillion  men in the  field, and that if we had made no advances  to our Allies andDominions we could put 1,675,000  more men in the field.  These last  two items heconsiders must rank as practical  additions to the number of men we have under armsand the labour necessary to  supply them.  Assuming that we have 2,500,000  menunder arms at the present time,  our Allies are really getting out of us the equivalentAvar energy of approximately 5,000,000 men.    If our Allies  would rather have a million more British soldiers in  the field thanthe British Navy,  or 1,675,000 British soldiers in the field instead of 335,000,000/. inadvances and loans,  they should say so.   They cannot have both.    We  have examined this argument with close  attention, and while admiringits ingenuity,  we think it is inapplicable  to the  real problems  we are trying tosolve.   These are essentially problems of selection and substitution.  The Chancellorof the Exchequers man-power unit is not  man-poAver, but an abstraction composedof the labour  of  men,  women,  and children.   It  has  no place  in any argumentbearing upon the number of males who  may be employed in an army.  Secondly, it isunreasonable to lump men,  women, and children together when  the problem to befaced consists in the substitution over large  areas of industry of female and childlabour for that of military  males.   Thirdly, it  is unreasonable  to assume that alllabour is equally productive, or that all production is equally important.
     If we look at the industrial groups supplied us by the President of the Board of Trade, we observe that it would &quot;be easy to select 2,000,000 men without reducing production at all ; or, alternatively, so  to select them as to bring all  production to a standstill.  We think that a calculation and line of argument must  be misleading which assumes that  the whole industrial population is equally employed in making per annum 200 pounds apiece worth of munitions or its equivalent in export; or which treats,  for instance, the labour of 70,000 actors  as of the same  indispensable value as that of  70,000 skilled mechanics,  and regards the labour  of  footmen as worth 200Z.  a year in   productive war energy to the  State, while  treating  the labour of the women textile workers  in the greatest  of our export  trades as  a mere adjunct to male labour     If  2,500,000 men have, according to the President.of the  Board  of  Trade, been  withdrawn for  the fighting forces at  200/. apiece, our total  production  ought to be diminished by  500,000,000/. a year.  We have found no evidence of any such diminution in the national output. The exports of the United Kingdom produce have, it is true,  declined by  81,000,000/. in seven months, i.e., at  a rate  of  140,000,000/. a year.  There is no reason to assume that this falling off is only due  to a lessened production of exportable goods, since it can be largely accounted for by other causes.    It  does  not appear  that  we are  producing less in  volume for the  home market, except possibly in coal.  On the contrary, there is  great activity in most of the home market  industries, and the President of  the Board of Trade  has informed us that  the working  classes never before spent so much  on clothing.   They  could not buy more clothes if they were not being produced.   Moreover, the imports of raw material have risen substantially,  and  this  increase  in  the importation of  raw materials by itself largely  disposes  of the theory of reduced total production in the United Kingdom.    Further, the falling off in  manufactured exports was more rapid in the early months  of  the war  than  in  the latest  months of  wdiich we have information.   If it had been due to the withdrawal of  men, and  if such withdrawal could not be made good by  extra  efficiency or female labour,  obviously the decline would have been more marked as the numbers recruited increased.    We  think it necessary to  point  out  that  the  productive power of a  great industrial  community is very  elastic.   What we normally produce  is no measure of what we can produce under the stress  of wholly  exceptional circumstances.   Certain men no  doubt in every industry  are irreplaceable,  but  for the majority of workers there is a  considerable latitude of substitution.  Women and boys take  the  place of men,  elderly or  unemployed men  are  reabsorbed, the  remaining men  work harder, &amp;c.                                                                ls)    So far as the production of food is concerned, it would appear that  there  has been an increase  and not a diminution during the war.   The high prices prevailing have stimulated production in the neutral countries, and the efforts of the belligerent States to make themselves self-supporting have led, in some cases, to large domestic increases.    Without at  all  underrating the  deplorable  consequences of  the  war, or  the waste attendant upon it, we  see no reason  to apprehend  any general breakdown in the productive energies of the world.   On the contrary, the main  volume  of  those energies is in full activity, and the proportion lost can be largely made up by normal expansion, curtailment of luxuries, and more strenuous  efforts.  It is certain that  the financial situation can and will,  in some way or another, bring itself into conformity with the natural and  actual facts of the world&apos;s production  wdiich underlie it, both during the war and at its close.  Convulsive movements  of the financial apparatus and temporary difficulties in regard to credit and exchange will certainly be corrected and overcome so long as the natural basis of productivity is sound.  It has already beenthe experience of every belligerent country in the present war to be informed that  the financial difficulties at this  or that stage  were insuperable, whereas  they have in  all cases been overcome.    For the reasons  which  we  have  given,  we  do not consider that the financial situation, as laid before us by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should prevent usfrom carrying out in its entirety Lord Kitchener&apos;s 70-divisions scheme.    We draw, however, from the Chancellor of  the Exchequers statement, a moral of a  different  character.   He has  shown wdth  clearness and force the variety of services which we are rendering to the common cause, that their  importance  is inmany cases in no way inferior  to  actual military  participation,  and that in  somerespects these services are absolutely vital to  ourselves and to our Allies.   We believe
that it is still within our power to discharge these services during the whole of theperiod covered hy our enquiry, and at the same time to maintain in the field an armyof medium yet formidable dimensions.  But we  can only do this if all our resourcesin wealth and man power are employed without reserve with the most thorough  andfar-sighted efficiency.   We  cannot afford, as in Germany or France, to sweep into thearmy  the great mass of the military manhood of the country.   Neither can we affordto take men indiscriminately for military service as they present themselves, withoutregard to their individual services or their usefulness in other spheres.  With us theproblem is more complex ; the quality of the effort must be  higher and more varied;the need for control and organisation even more vital.   Of all the belligerent nationswe are the one which can  least afford to take a married man of 40 while a bachelorof 25  is idle.  It is not wise to take a skilled  munition worker for the front while aprivate domestic remains at home.   We ought not to  let one district  be  depletedthrough its patriotism of the indispensable minimum of agricultural or unskilled labour,while in another the recruiters  have made practically no headway.  We cannot closewhole industries to recruiting even the most suitable  men, while in others we sweepevery man, even up to the oldest father of a family, into the line of battle.  We cannotafford  to fill our marching battalions  with an undue proportion of men past theirprime.  We  cannot afford to  let a military male needed  for  the  army  do workwhich could be done by a woman, a boy, or an older man.  Greater efforts in nationalorganisation are required to remedy  these defects, and thus  ensure in all its variousforms the maximum development of war energy among our people.                   IX. THE  STATEMENT  OE LORD KITCHENER.    We do not repeat here Lord Kitchener&apos;s evidence, as it is printed in full in theReport.                        X SUMMARY OE CONCLUSIONS.    On a review of  the evidence above summarised, we are of  opinion that -    (a.) It is necessary and feasible to place  and maintain in the field  an army of          70 British divisions.    (o.) The munitions will be  forthcoming.  It will be possible to arm, equip, and          supply an army  of this size from March 1916 onwards.    (c.) Sufficient  numbers of  men  exist  in the United Kingdom  to form and          maintain this army, but they cannot be obtained on a voluntary basis.    (d.) The  numbers  required can be spared from industry if, and only if, a proper          system of selection is employed.    (e.) Financial arrangements can be made to maintain the 70-divisions army up          to the end of 1916,  and to fulfil all the other obligations  that we  have          contracted.    (/.) It will be  desirable on military grounds, if  otherwise possible,  to increase          the army to 100  divisions,  and munitions for this larger number would he          forthcoming from the beginning of August 1916.    A decision by the Cabinet is urgently required on the following question:     Whether the 70-divisions scheme is to be cut down to the limits which can hesupplied by voluntary enlistment, or whether  it is to be maintained and  carried outby compulsion.

                MEMORANDUM  BY  MR.  A.  HENDERSON.     1. THE CoBective Report prepared by Lord Crewe summarises the evidence with accuracy and impartiality.   It endeavours to show  the  resources of the nation in man-power  and equipment with a view to  the successful termination  of  the war during 1916, having regard to financial and industrial  possibilities.   As I signed the Report I  should have preferred  to reserve any further expression of opinion on the question  of compulsion until such time as the matter comes up for discussion in the Cabinet.  As, however,  some of my colleagues on the Committee have decided to circulate a Supplementary Memorandum  giving their  conclusions, and making definite recommendations in favour of the early introduction of compulsory as against voluntary  enlistment, I think it my duty to state to the  Cabinet  the views I have formed, and the views which I believe to  be held by the  great majority of the working classes, especially those that are organised.     2. The  evidence laid before the Committee  shows  conclusively that the ideal of 100  divisions in the field during  April 1916, wdth all necessary reserves of men and equipment, is quite unattainable.   If we had the men and the officers, we should not have the munitions.  Lord Kitchener informed  the  Committee  that the obligations of this  country to  the Allies  contracted at  the Boulogne Conference would  be discharged if we placed 70 divisions in the field early next year.  The evidence of the Minister of Munitions  showed that in two vital particulars, viz., heavy artillery and  machine  guns,  the  equipment  of  70 divisions is only  to  be achieved  by employing .all our resources  of manufacture to the full.  I conclude, therefore, that while keeping the figure 70 divisions steadily before us as representing the minimum we must supply, we should also recognise it as the maximum.  Eor  every purpose of policy and administration it is better to work  to  a  specific than  to an elastic figure, and  for every purpose  of war 70 divisions fully equipped, led by efficient officers and&quot; supported  by the necessary reserves, must surely be better than 100 divisions badly led and partially equipped.   On the question of officers, I may quote a sentence from Lord Kitchener&apos;s evidence :         &quot;Up till next spring I can  do  no more than 70 divisions.   I am limited by    officers, which is a very serious item, and  there are other things.....It is    more impressed upon me than ever that we cannot trust the lives of our men to    inefficient officers.&quot;    As regards  munitions, I would, point out that if, as the Ministry hope, we find ourselves with more  rifles than are  required,  there are always the Bussian forces to be supplied.   On every ground, therefore, it appears to me that the plan of  limiting our military  effort and concentrating  the balance  of our  energies on output is commended by military considerations as well as by the increasing financial demands that are being made upon us by our Colonies,  the Allies, and by neutral countries.    3. With this conclusion I think most of the members of the Committee are reallyin agreement.  So far as we differ it is on the issue as to whether we can, by confiningourselves  to voluntary  enlistment, secure the  numbers necessary  to maintain anarmy of 70 divisions  at strength, and whether, while  retaining the voluntary system,it  is  possible to  avoid  injury to indispensable  trades by applying  the principle of selection.    4. Now, what  are  the  numbers required ?   The question put to the  Adjutant- General was:         &quot; How many men will you require to have  enlisted from the beginning of    the war, including those available  at the outbreak, in order to put in the field    at the earliest possible  moment when they can be equipped, and  to maintain    continuously in contact with the enemy up to the end of the year 1916 :         &quot;(a.)   50 divisions.        &quot;(b.)  70     ,,        &quot; (c.) 100     ,,    In reply the Adjutant-General, while guarding himself from giving exact figures(which in the nature of the  case is not possible), wrote :         &quot; It may be taken as a rough guide that  in order to  maintain (a) 50, (6) 70,    and (c)  100 divisions in the field up to the end of 1916, it would  be  necessary      [1112]                                                          H
    to enlist in addition to those taken in the first year (a) 750,000 men, or a weekly    intake  of  10,000 recruits; (6)  1,700,000 men, or  a weekly  intake  of  23,000    recruits;  (c) 2,400,000 men, or a weekly intake of 32,000 recruits.&quot;    A  deficit has  of course accumulated in  the five weeks since the end  of thefirst year of war, during which time the recruiting has maintained a level of 20,000 aweek, although  Lord Kitchener informed us that in one week he got 24,000.  TheCollective Report  (paragraph 22) is  correct, I think, in stating  our requirements asbeing at least 25,000 a week.   I am, however, prepared to go further  and  accept asour guiding principle the  statement made by Lord  Kitchener:  &quot;If I  could  get1,500,000 a year I  would not  go  for. conscription.&quot;   1,500,000  a year  means anaddition of 500,000 to the present recruiting, or, if 100,000  men are withdrawn fromthe colours for  munitions,  600,000.   Even taking this figure, however,  I  cannotadmit, until it is proved by experience, that it is impossible to raise the requisitebalance by the voluntary system.  It is to be remembered  that recruiting has  beenproceeding  almost mechanically; no special appeal  has lately been made  to thepeople; no striking reports have reached them of  events  on the Western Front, andonly occasionally in  the Dardanelles; above all, figures of eulistment  have not  beenmentioned.  In spite of these things our intake is, as  already stated, about 20,000 aweek.   It is  almost universally admitted that the system under  which  our  newarmies have been secured so  far as numbers  are concerned has been a giganticsuccess.  Lord Kitchener speaks of the recruiting as the  most astonishing  fact inconnection with the whole war.  The magnificent response and  the spirit prompting-it  have been so valuable to  the whole British Empire  throughout this  unprecedentedcrisis, that only as a last extremity should any departure be made from the  conditionsunder which that response has been secured and that spirit maintained.    5. I shall doubtless be  asked what steps  I  propose  should  be  taken  if  theCabinet  decides  that 70 divisions  must  be placed  in  the field  and maintainedthroughout the  Avar, if compulsory  enlistment  is immediately  impossible.  If LordKitchener,  speaking Avith all his  unique authority and  supported  by  a  unitedGovernment, made it clear that the only way, in his judgment, to carry the Avar  to asuccessful conclusion was considerably to increase the Allied Forces ; that the presentrate of recruiting must be increased by 50 per cent.;  and that if this could  not heaccomplished  by voluntary enlistment  it would be imperative for him to ask theCabinet to come to Parliament for compulsory powers, if he would meet the  leadersof the organised  workers in private conference, and  explain Avhy we need  more menand the consequences of our not getting  them, his action would go far to  make anychange and all the risks Avhich the change involves unnecessary.  I am  conviucedthat there  is no  possible chance of  altering our system  of enlistment unless LordKitchener  is prepared to say that the A^oluntary method has failed to give him themen required  for the saving of. the nation.  I  urge, therefore, the importance  of  ourmaking a supreme effort to obtain on the  voluntary principle the 500,000 to 000,000men still required above present figures.   Tactically, such a procedure seems to meto have enormous advantages.  It would commit the Avhole nation to making voluntaryenlistment successful for a definite  object.   If the effort  failed, the nation wouldrealise as never before that AA*e  Avere committed to compulsion.   If we try to makethe journey in  one  stage  from  voluntary enlistment for  an  undefined  object toconscription for  a  defined  object,  Avithout  having  taken  the  people  into  ourconfidence  by giving them all  the  information  and facts at our  disposal, Ave shallmeet  with almost insuperable  difficulties, accompanied  with  a divided Cabinet, adivided Parliament, and a divided nation.    6. From Avhat I have stated it will be seen that I am prepared, as a  last extremity,to accept compulsion for a definite and  publicly stated object.  But I do not thinkthat the signatories of the Supplemental Memorandum can ever have attempted toestimate the strength of  feeling  existing against conscription or  the grounds onwhich it is based.  I need not emphasise the extent to Avhieh  a strong dislike increasesthe difficulties  incidental to any administrative change or the danger  of staking thesuccessful conduct of the Avar on the possible opposition to compulsion on the part ofone or two  powerful trade unions.  1 hese are risks Avhich Avould have to be confronteduuder Avhatever circumstances compulsion vras introduced, and though  I believe theycould be greatly mitigated, I do not claim that they Avould be Avholly removed, even ifAve proceeded in the manner I have suggested above.  But unless they are confrontedwith the utmost  skill as well as resolution I fear that  they may involve  a greaterdanger than any failure to adopt compulsion Avould bring upon us.
    7. Of the volume of feeling against conscription some estimate may he formedfrom the fact  that since the outbreak of the  newspaper agitation on the subject Ihave received  upwards of 300 resolutions representing in one way or other almost allthe important industries of  the country.   I  must  also remind the Cabinet  of thedecisions of the Trade Congress and the General Federation  of Trades Unions.    8. Of the  nature of  the objections it is naturally not easy to give a clear account.Those who feel them most do not necessarily express  them best,  and mixed up withpositive arguments against conscription you find generalities about civil liberty andPrussianism, which mean little more than the similar references to national duty andshirkers on the other side.   But I have necessarily  had the question  before me eversince the war broke out, and particularly since I joined the Cabinet, because holdingthe view I do that if conscription  is necessary to  save the nation conscription willcome, I have been at great  pains to consider  wdiat the arguments are wdiich  I mayhave to meet in the ranks of  my own people.    9. The working man of  this country does not believe that he has an equal or hislegitimate share  in Government.  Freedom is both an instinct and  a passion withhim  (that is why he is  fighting now), and because he believes that the laws limitand restrain his freedom in the interests of the employer he clings more  stubbornlyto what those laws  leave  him  with.  He will place  himself  under discipline  ifdiscipline  is part of  the free  contract;  he  strongly objects being  placed   underdiscipline by authority.   A  hundred thousand men have  enrolled themselves understrict conditions  as munition volunteers, but our attempt to apply the Munitions Actto South Wales was regarded by the workers  as a signal failure.  This temper, andthe  independence and   self-respect  which   it  generates, is a military asset  ofincalculable  value.  I doubt if it  can be broken; I am  sure it cannot be crossedwithout danger to the State.    10. I wdll mention  one  manifestation of  this spirit which I encounter wheneverI  discuss  Compulsion wdth  working  men.    All our Begistration  Laws  appear  tohim to be framed in the  interests of the employing class.  The 40s. freeholder gets onthe Begister in six months  and stays there.   The  workman wTho is a householder,or living in lodgings, or moving about from place  to place, may have to wrait a yearand eleven months, and then he is so  easily disqualified.  Conscription,  except ongrounds of clear military necessity, could only be introduced by Act of Parliament,with the approval of  the people, at  a  General  Election, and there are in this countrythousands of working men wdio would deny altogether the competence of a Parliamentelected under our present Franchise and Begistration Laws  to bind them on an issueof life and death.  In the abstract, it sounds  well to  say that the State has a rightto the services of all its citizens;  but to wrorking-class voters the proposition meansthat A can make B go for  a soldier because  A  has  a house and B is a lodger, andthat 0, who is childless,  can  dispose of the four. sons of D  and E because, in additionto his house, he has property in two other constituencies.             . .     11. In the  second  place the  working man does not believe  that the  toll  ofconscription would be levied equally on  him  and his employer.   As a volunteer, hefeels that the rich man who is fighting beside  him has, like himself, made greatsacrifices.   As a conscript, he would feel that  he had  been  placed in the trenches bythe votes of rich men who were not there themselves.  If he were convinced, thatconscription was being  administered evenly  between rich  and poor  he  would stillthink that while both had had something taken from them the rich man had muchmore left.  The  suspicion of  private advantage at the  public cost, wdiich is one  of themain roots  of our industrial difficulties, would be intensely aggravated  wdien  thepoint at issue was not  profit but life.  I do  not know  how it is proposed under aconscript system to find officers for the armies it is proposed to  raise,  but I  do notsee how under such a system it is possible to  maintain the relations  between officersand men on which the discipline and, to a large  extent, tbe success  of our volunteerarmies has always depended.  If conscription were introduced in.a passion of classfeeling, class feeling would  attend the conscript army in  the field.   If, as has beensuggested, the pay and  other conditions of the conscripts were to be less favourablethan the volunteers the  dissatisfaction would be dangerous in its intensity.     12. In the third place,  there is the belief that  conscription is a capitalist weaponfor interfering with the rights of the workmen.  The trade unionists wdll view withgrave resentment anything  which  maybe represented as  an attempt to circumventtheir freedom of action, and if the miners, railway men, and other  highly organisedtrades Were exempt  from conscription (as they would probably have to be) they couldcome forward as champions  of their class without anv  imputation on their courage       [1112]                                      *    1               I   D
I lay stress on this aspect of the question because Mr. Lloyd George definitely advocatesalong with direct military compulsion a roundabout form of industrial compulsion,he., as I  understand  him,  if a man wanted for shell-making will not make shells,he will be put in the  army, and then made to  make them.  What would happen ifhe thereupon  struck  for higher wages,  and the  miners struck in. sympathy, I amnot sure.   He  might  be  sent to the army  again, but that would  not  bring  theminers back.    13. To the strong instinctive dislike of compulsion, based upon and  fortified byconsiderations  like these, there is only one argument that can be used in reply theargument of  necessity.   &quot; It is  necessary to  have men, it is  necessary  to have somany,.it is necessary to  discriminate between one trade  and another, and between themarried and single.&quot;  The  power of discrimination is, on the whole, the most cogentargument for  conscription.    But  it  is  surely an  argument which  cannot  beconvincingly  applied  until we  have at least  made  the  experiment of using theNational Register to co-ordinate and direct our recruiting efforts on the principle ofselection.   If  then we  find that we cannot get the requisite numbers, or cannot getthem without ruining  certain  trades, the  argument  from necessity will be over-whelming, and, given certain guarantees which I will  mention, I should be preparedto use it with considerable confidence of  success.    11. I think  it is right in this connection to call the attention of my colleaguesto what may be described  as a parliamentary  objection to a premature attempt toforce  compulsion arising out of certain statements made in the House of Commons.    On the 5th July  Mr. P. Alden asked the Prime Minister &quot; &quot;Whether he is able toassure the House with respect  to the National  Register  Bill, that no  such action asthe  introduction of  forced  labour or  conscription  is   in  contemplation by  theGovernment ? &quot;   The  Prime Minister  replied:  &quot; No  such action as is referred toin the question is contemplated.&quot; Speaking on  the second reading of  the Bill on thesame  day, Mr. Long said:           &quot; I have observed  that one  of the objections to this Bill is that  it contains    in some mysterious and concealed fashion the policy of conscription.....  I    think that after the answer  given by the Prime Minister  to-day ....  nobody    can seriously advance  that proposition..... This Bill  leaves  the question of    compulsory service exactly where it is and where it has been; it  does not affect    it one way or the other.&quot;    I do not suggest  [that  these  words  imply a pledge that the Register will not beused  in  connection with conscription.   Such  a limitation  of  our powers  would beabsurd.   But in  face of  the words I have quoted, it would be difficult to defend thegood  faith of the Government if we introduced  conscription the moment the Registerwas  complete.   We might argue that we had been led to it by other considerationsand that we should have arrived at  the  same conclusion had there been no Register.But the coincidence of  the  completion of the Register and the change  in our opinionswould be  too striking.  Speaking for myself, I should find it difficult to defend myown  consistency,  if  after adAroeating  the Register  as  an adjunct to  voluntaryrecruiting, I became  responsible as a member of the  Government for conscriptionbefore even the experiment  had been   tried  of  using  the Register to  guide theactivities of the recruiting authorities.     15. The  argument,  of  time may be  used against  my suggested procedure.   Thereply, I think, is that  no time need be  lost at all.  Three months would be sufficienttime  in  which  to judge  whether  our  efforts  were likely to  succeed  or not,  andcertainly  would  not be  too  long to spend on drafting the  necessaiy Bill and planningthe necessary machinery for levying 1,500,000  men.  Lord  Kitchener, I  understand,did not contemplate  asking for compulsory powers immediately.  Nations to whomconscription is habitual have spent years without making their system  perfect, andwhatever else we do  we must at any rate make sure that conscription does not breakdown through administrative collapse.   I join with the Pirst Lord in thinking that,whatever our  ultimate  decision may be,  we ought to lose no time in preparing a Billto clear our own minds as to what we  mean by conscription.   Merely to administerthe exemptions  will  be a  task of  magnitude,  and where the  rights of individualsinvolve their  lives  the most scrupulous attention must  be paid beforehand to thedrafting of rules and  the preparation of  machinery for enforcing them.     16.  I come now to the question of the guarantees,  which in  the  opinion  ofmany should  accompany enforced military service.   The guarantees correspond  to
 the three principal objections which appear to me to be at the bottom of the opposition to conscription, and which will remain, even  if  the working-classes  are convinced that conscription is necessary     (a.)  Conscription should be accompanied by such a  measure of electoral reform             as will remove the principal  inequalities in  our present system, viz.,             the plural  voter and the anomalies connected with registration, and in             particular the lodgers&apos; vote, by establishing&apos; universal suffrage.     (b.)  Compulsion should be accompanied by such measures of taxation as would             spread  the burden of the war equitably over all  classes according to             ability to pay, remembering that the toll  of  life will be heavier, pro-             portionately,  on the employed than the employing class, by reason of             the difference in  their average ages.  Such taxation  should be aimed             at luxuries, unearned, incomes, and  war profits in  the first jjlace, and             secondly  at rents and profits  in  general.   It is also claimed that, to             avoid penalising the families  of  soldiers,  no further  indirect taxation             should  be imposed, and that the Government should undertake to give             the conscripts the same pay and  allowances  as  are received by those             now in the army.    (c.) It is also urged that the most  definite pledges  should  be  given  that             conscription will not be continued  beyond the present war (allowing a             reasonable  interval for  disbandment), that special  machinery will  be             created for replacing soldiers in industry, and  that conscription will not             be used to effect any change in  the existing arrangements, whether             under. the Munitions Act, the  Trade Disputes Act,  or  the general  law,             for dealing  with industrial disputes.    16. To sum up.  It is useless to ignore the fact that conscription has become  tosome extent a  party question and the subject of  serious controversy.   As such, it isgathering to  itself other party questions on which the working-classes feel and thinkstrongly.   Party and class are coming to coincide as they did before  the war.   Theunity of the nation is in danger.  Our aim must be to  handle the situation so  thatcompulsion,  if  it comes, comes by the action  of. the  people  themselves.  On thealternative of conscription or defeat they will be united  again.   But they cannot bebrought to that alternative suddenly, or apart from the conviction that it is a militarynecessity.   They must have time.  And if the time is  spent  in a  final endeavour,made after the most solemn appeal  and on a full and reasoned statement  of ourobligations to  our  Allies, to meet those obligations  voluntarily,  I believe that oneof two results will follow.  Either conscription will be accepted  without serious injuryto the nation or it will be proved to be unnecessary.                                                                      A. H.
