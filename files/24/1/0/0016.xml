This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.  Notes and private telegram from the Viceroy regarding the    future settlement of Eastern Turkey in Asia and Arabia. NOTE BY THE SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPARTMENT,  INDIA OFFICE.   At  the  beginning of  the war with Turkey,  His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentgave assurances  to the Sheikhs  of  Kovveit  and  Mohaminera and  to the.Amir of  Nejd, in return for their support, that Basra would  never again besubject to Turkish authority. . These notes are an attempt to indicate someof the  factors that must be considered in  determining what is to  be donewith it. .   I. Geograpliy. The area at present occupied  by British troops is but asmall part  of the  vilayet  of Basra; but in thinking of the future  of  theterritory  that is to be removed from Turkish rule at the end  of a successfulwar it  is necessary to consider this area in its  place against a somewhatwider geographical background.  That background is the Abbasid Provincesof Jezireh  and Irak Arabi, which under  Ottoman rule became  the  singleProvince of Bagdad until  it was  divided  into  three by the  separation ofthe Mosul vilayet in 1878 and the Basra vilayet in 188-1.   This larger area  is comprised within the mountains  in  which runs theTurco-Persian frontier to the east, the Syrian desert and the Arabian plateauto the west, the foothills of  the Anti-Taurus to  the north, and the PersianGulf to the south, and it  measures about  100,000  square  miles.   It is ageographical unit, in. the sense that its main characteristic is the river.systemsof the Euphrates .and the Tigris, and that it has  no other natural limits thanthose just mentioned.   For from the shore of the Gulf in lat. 30o to Nisibin inHIT. 37c only one lateral mountain range breaks the level of the plain betweenthe two rivers, viz.,  the Jebel Sin jar (3,000 feet)  in  the latitude of Mosul(3G0  35&apos;) ;  and  from the moment that  the two rivers  debouch upon thisplain they pursue their course down  its  gentle declivity to the Gulf withoutinterruption save AVHERE the Tigris cuts through the Jebel Hamrin in lat. 35c.This range  of hills an  incongruous heap of barren  mounds, composed ofsandstone and  pebbles, about 500 feet high at the Tigris cutting-runs forsome 30  miles along the right bank of the river, and then, on the left bank,bends  south-eastwards  in  a low, but almost unbroken, line,  to Ahwaz  inArabistan.   Immediately south of it began the  great irrigation  works  ofthe past (Ritter Erdkunde XL, 678).   II.  Geology. But though  the configuration of the whole  of this  area isthus uniform, climate and the nature of the soil have marked it  out intothree distinct zones.  The northernmost of these, extending from the foothillsto a little south of the Jebel  Sinjar, being well watered by rivers and havingan adequate rainfall,  is a plain of exuberant fertility, where in the spring therider is almost over-powered by the scent of the flowers which his horse treadsunder foot.   Its potentialities have just been realised, and wealthy men furthersouth are beginning to buy up tracts of it and take them into cultivation.Next, and extending to a  line drawn from  Tekrit on the Tigris to Hit onthe Euphrates,  stretches a  wilderness-not, however, one in  the sense inwhich  the Yemen and the Sahara are wildernesses, but rather a plain whicheven beyond the reach of the rivers is covered with grass for  some monthsafter the winter rains ; on which, where it is commanded by  the rivers or indepressions, a considerable  quantity of  wheat and barley, according  to  SirW. Willcocks, is even now raised ;  and of which he says that  the presence of15 per cent, of lime  in its soil makes its reclamation very easy as comparedwith Egypt.  Oppenheim,  on the other hand, is of opinion that a good dealof this belt, at a distance from the two rivers, will always be uncultivable owingto the proportion of gypsum which the soil contains, and  Chesney&apos;s MapVII.  and information  from  other sources  tend  to  confirm this  view asregards  the centre of  the tract lying between Hit and Bagdad.  It  seemsprobable that it  would not repay irrigation at a distance from the  rivers,     S. 202.                         A
even if  water on  a  large  scale could be spared  for  it.   I Jut it will alwaysremain pasture land for the tribes  in spring.  .  Finally,  south  of  the  Tekrit-Hit  line  to  the  Gulf  stretches  thealluvial plain  forming the delta of  the Euphrates  and the Tigris,  whosepotential fertility is now a  matter of common  knowledge-an  area  of 12million  acres, of which  0 are at present wilderness and 2\  fresh-waterswamp, awaiting irrigation and drainage respectively.    III.  Ethnology. The essential  unity of this  great area is emphasised bythe homogeneity of its population, which is almost exclusively Arab, exceptfor the strip of mountainous country lying between the Tigris and the Turco-Persian frontier north of  the Jebel Hamrin, which is rather an off-shoot ofKurdistan than a part of El Jezireh.   There  is indeed  a Kurdish elementon  the  southern  section  of the Turco-Persian  frontier, and the  towns ofBagdad and  Basra have, of  course, attracted  people of  many nationalities,notably Persians in the neighbourhood of Nejef and Kerbela.   But speakinggenerally, the  Arabs form the  predominant part of  the population,  Theyconsist of a large number  of tribes Lorimer enmnerates over 100 in TurkishIrak the most important being the Northern and Southern Shammar (dividedroughly by a  line drawn from  Mosul to Mejadin on the Tigris) who rangeover the whole area between the two. rivers from  north of  the Jebel Sin jar tothe neighbourhood of Bagdad, itself; their hereditary enemies, the Anaizah,in the  desert west of  the  Euphrates ; the Muntilik, in the  lower part of thedelta between  Kut-el-Amara on the Tigris and Nasriyeh  on the Euphrates ;and the Beni  Lam, half  in Irak and. half in  Persia,  in.  the neighbourhoodof Araara.   The first, two  named are Sunnis,  as  are the  riding clan of theMuntifik, but  most of the rest of the tribes  are Shiahs.  They are largelynomadic in. their habits,  but  in the neighbourhood of  water they tend tosettle down into fellaheen  ; for  their ruling passion  is acquisitiveness,  andwhere cultivation can  be demonstrated to be more profitable than  robberythey show  no  objection  to  applying themselves to it.   South of Bagdad,indeed,  they are already only  semi-nomadic, wandering  in the desert inspring, but cultivating the banks of the rivers during the rest of  the year.One of the first tasks of the administrator is to  complete the process of trans-.formation and  pacification to  which  the Turks have never addressed  them-selves, having been content with maintaining a very precarious peace by thetime-honoured expedient  of playing off one tribe against another.   In aninteresting note Oppenheim  illustrates the task  from the historv of Egypt(Vom Mittelmeer Z. persischen  Gulf 11. p. 8.1).   Reference has been made above to the Kurds, and Kurdistan  will be animportant  factor in  any future  settlement  of this  region.   A  belt ofmountainous country,  with a population of some 3,000,000, whose character-istics are well  known, it lies between Armenia,  which will presumably  fallto Russia, and the plain of El Jezireh, from which no barrier separates it,and the only pass through which Russia can emerge to the  Mediterranean -the pass of Bitlis lies in its heart.   To the Power that  controls the plainthe Kurds  will  be, as are  the tribes  of  the  North-West frontier to  thePunjab a constant source of inconvenience if left to themselves,  a  standingmenace  if under the influence of an intriguing Power behind them.   IV. Communications. Mr. George  Lloyd  in.  his  confidential report onMesopotamia  has remarked that the country  has three  primary needs communications, irrigation, and administrative  reorganisation.   Roads. Beginning from   the   south  it   will  be   noticed   that  notBasra but Bagdad  is the centre of  trade routes; Basra being merely  theport at which ocean-going steamers tranship their cargo into river steamersfor  Bagdad.  From Bagdad there are  four great caravan routes-North-east via  Khanikin  to Kermanshah in Persia  (the route  over which mostof our trade  with Western Persia  passes); on  either side of  the  Tigristo  Mosul,  that   on   the  right bank  being  exposed   to  the  Shammar,and  that  on  the  left  (through  Kerkuk  and  Erbil) to  the  Hamawand(Kurds);  on the right bank of the Euphrates  (exposed to  the Aoaizah)to Hit,  whence one  branch  runs 1o Aleppo,  one  to Damascus, and  one
across  the  Jezireh  (in three days) to Mosul.  Mosul in turn is connectedwith Aleppo  and Damascus, on the  one  hand, and  2Jorth-West Persia onthe other.  These are the  traditional  lines,  and traditions in  this regionare not easily changed.  It is necessary to bear them in mind in  consideringrailway propositions.   Railways. Is it to be assumed that the Bagdad Railway will be finished ?With the disappearance of the Turk and of German interests from Constanti-nople its immediate purpose will  have disappeared  also.   It was  never ao-ood commercial undertaking,  for  though eastern Turkey in Asia greatlyneeds railway development,  the  Bagdad  Railway promised to supply it as.little as did. the Trans-Persian Scheme in Persia.  In both cases  what iswanted is not long and expensive railway   connection with necessarily highrates between continent and continent,  but the connection of the fertilehinterlands with the sea by the construction of railways to the natural outletsof trade, the eventual  linking-up  of such  lines into  a trans-continentalsystem being left to lie determined by the course of future  development.Thus,  AVHILE a  through line from AJexandretta via  Aleppo and Mosul toBagdad and  Basra seems unnecessary, and  strategically undesirable  fromour point of view, either  the  Alexandretta-Mosul  section  (with, perhaps,eventually  an extension to Erbil.  and Kerkuk  to  serve  the  fertile  andpetroliferous districts of South-East Kurdistan) or the  Mosul-Bagdad section,seems  inevitable, and a line from Bagdad to Basra, with an extension toKhanikin to serve West Persia,  is a matter of urgent necessity  in the earlyfuture.   Such, a line must proceed hand in hand with the irrigation works,,which will, supply it both with embankments and with&apos;traffic,  in a remoterfuture,  when the development of the delta is far advanced, another scheme maybe revived Sir W. Willcocks&apos; Mediterranean project, i.e., a railway from theMediterranean (whether from Haifa, or an extension of the French Tripoli-Horns project) through Palmyra to Abu  Kemal (or, as the French  prefer,Deir-ez-Zor), on  the Euphrates, and so via Hit (the terminus  of free rivernavigation,  and, according to him, the future river port) to Bagdad.   Waterways:   What the future of  the  Tigris and  Euphrates is  to be asmeans  of communication is  obscure.   Will the irrigation works render themuseless&apos;?  Sir  W.  Willcocks has given  uncertain sounds on  this point.&apos;On the other hand it is understood that  the  Germans confident^ expectedthat, under the  arrangement which  was being  negotiated when  the  warbroke out, Lord  Inchcape would  be left  high  and dry  at Basra in  seven&apos;years.  In.  any case, it is clear  that the irrigation AVORKS must  be  plannedwith due consideration for the interests of river conservancy, which meansthat irrigation and  conservaiurv must  be  under the same ultimate control.And, whatever may happen to&apos;the Euphrates and the Tigris, British interestsrecptire that the  Shat-el-Arab,  south  of Basra at all events, shall always bekept open  for  navigation,  and an early examination by  experts  of theproblems which the river presents is a matter of urgent importance.    This very superficial, sketch has  been given as tending to suggest threerellections,  (1) that whoever holds Bagdad  commands British  trade  withPersia  of  an annual value of  upwards  of  a  million  sterling;   (2) thatAVHOEVER  controls the Shat-el-Arab  must  control the  irrigation works northof it;  (3) that  the Power  which commands  the sea, and holds Basra  andAlexandretta, has two  independent  and equally easy lines  of approachtowards the pass of Bitlis.    V. Irrigation. It is obviously impossible to go into this great question here.But one or two points  must be indicated.  As has already been mentioned,the  ancient systems began with the  Nahr Hafu, immediately south of thepomUit which the Tigris pierces the  Jebel Hamrin, to the north of Tekrit.Sir W. Willcocks&apos;  schemes  begin  at  Beled  on the Tigris and  Hit  on theEuphrates, and these schemes hang together in the sense that quite obviouslythe lower sections are . dependent  on  the upper, AVHILE the naAugability. ofthe  Shat-el-Arab is  dependent on  both.  In  other Avords,  the  PoAver that
intends to  develop the Basra vilayet  must also be the Power that developsthe vilayet of Bagdad, and must also be the Power  that commands, at leastpolitically, the upper reaches of the rivers to Mosul and Rakka.    With irrigation is bound up the question of labour.  The entire popula-tion of  the Bagdad and Basra vilayets probably does not exceed l,.r:00,000,and it. has been objected  to  Sir W.  Willcocks&apos; scheme  that labour  is notforthcoming  locally either  to construct the works  or to cultivate the newly-irrigated region.   There  is  considerable divergence of  opinion on  thispoint among competent authorities.   No  doubt labour  in  the East is verymobile, and when it  is known that work and land are  to  be had, popula-ti.on  will tend  to  drift towards  Mesopotamia.  But the  sources of suchsupply  are  not very many the  inhabitants  of  the   highlands of AsiaMinor,  for example,  would not be able to exist in  the southern climate;and if Sir W. Willcocks&apos; dreams  even approach realisation  the area avail-able  is  so  vast  that  the supply  from within  can.  hardly meet the demand.It has accordingly been proposed-and this is a proposal requiring matureconsideration-to colonise Mesopotamia  from India.   The  arguments  infavour of this course are (1)  that we should get from the Punjab and Sindcolonists admirably suitable for the agricultural development which irrigationwill make possible, (2) that we should be giving India a tangible  reward forher services in the war, and by directly interesting her in the country removesome of the resentment which Indian Moslems  may be expected to feel at theBritish  share in. the dismemberment  of  the  Turkish Empire, (3) that  bycreating an  Indian colony the excuse for emigration  to  the white  manVcolonies would be removed.  (4) that an Indian, and especially a Punjabi, colonyAvOuld help to provide the  army necessary for its own. defence.   These are-weighty considerations, and the difficulties which there must necessarily bein the way of any such large  scheme are  believed by its  advocates to be farfrom insuperable.  It is probable that the indigenous population would notregard  the settlement of such immigres with favour.  But  there  is alreadya considerable Indian oolon\r, and the number of: Indian  pilgrims makesIndians more or less  familiar.  Moreover, if  Arab labour  were  not  forth-coming  for the  irrigation works and  Indians  had  to be imported for thispurpose, their subsequent settlement  on  the  soil would  be  more  or less  amatter  of course.  Religion  might  cause some difficulty, for the bulk  ofthe Arabs  are Shiahs and  the  colonists would  probably  be Sunnis; andlanguage would  be an obstacle to free intercourse for some years for Arabicand Persian only are spoken but so it would in the case of Turkish-speakingimmigrants.  Lastly, the climate would present difficulties to colonists fromany part of India unaccustomed  to extremes  of heat U14c to 1210) and cold(260 to  310).  It would, clearly not be possible  to  introduce Indian labouruntil it. had  been made plain that Arab labour is  inadequate and until allreasonable Arab  claims have been satisfied; and in any case great tact andgood management would be necessary, especially at first, for the  successfulassimilation of a mass of foreign labour even where  social conditions  are asfluid as they will be  during the great  process of  transformation whichMesopotamia has to undergo.  But,  when every objection has been stated,the fact remains  that there  is  a strong body of opinion that without foreignlabour, which must almost necessarily be Indian, the work cannot be done.    VI.  Administrative re-organisation is an essential condition of  thedevelopment  of the country.  Not, of course, the substitution of an elaboratemechanism  with hosts  of  officials and  red  tape,  and  codes of civil andcriminal procedure, but in  the first instance,  prompt administration of theexisting judicial system ; a reasonably efficient and honest police (which theKurdish element in the population would furnish); elementary education ;an adjustment  of the land tenures  to- new conditions ;  a  simplification ofthe taxation  by the removal  of  imposts that are at once  vexatious andunproductive; and, above  all,  elasticity  in  their  collection of  revenue.(Bagdad and Basra,  which  already  have a  measure of self-government,would, of course, require a more  complex municipal administration underBritish supervision).   The  land system will evidently be the crux.  The Turkish registrationof land  has been entirely,  reformed in the  Bagdad  vilayet during  thelast  few years,   and is now on  a sound  basis (in  Basra it is said to be
less efficient).  But the semi-nomad tribes of the delta have prescriptive rightsto certain pasture  grounds and  cultivated areas; and when  the  former aremade cultivable  bv irrigation, the  tribesmen must  either be provided withland  and become&apos; cultivators  or be compensated  elsewhere ;  and  in  themeantime they will probably view the extension of cultivation with a hostilitywhich may be greater if the cultivators are foreigners.   Water rights, again,are a  perennial source of friction, and will need regulation.   The policing ofthe area should be comparatively easy.  The Arabs do not love fighting forits  own  sake, and  the Turks have had  no difficulty in maintaining order,with a fairly efficient gendarmerie, whenever they have seriously attemptedto do so.  Moreover, south of Bagdad, at all events, the  tribes have givenhostages to fortune in that  they  have,  as already  mentioned, fixed habi-tations  and cultivated lands, for part of  the year;  the Government havetherefore  a hold   over  them.    The  Arabs   are   easily   governed,   thearbitrariness  of  successive vails has accustomed them to violent  changes,and it is anticipated that they would  settle with little  difficulty under  aforeign  administration if  it were equitable and  elastic  ; and  the Europeanstall required would be very small.    VII. The above sketch, necessarily very superficial, of the conditions of thecountry makes it possible  to  advance certain  tentative opinions as to itsfuture.   But  there is  one preliminary consideration.   This  country  ofMesopotamia  with its  extraordinary  potential  fertility and its wonderfulpast is  a great  deal more than so  main7  thousand  miles of &quot;light soil&quot;which we or any other civilised Power can  take  or leave at  pleasure.  Ourassurances that Basra would never again be allowed to come  under Turkishauthority were doubtless to a certain extent a political expedient to serve animmediate purpose.  Such an  expedient,  if it is to be legitimate, must havea moral justification.  And the moral justification in this case is the misruleof the Turk, who has reduced one of the  most fertile regions in the worldto  a  wilderness, has  maintained  it in that condition for  centuries, andthroughout his history  has shown no sign of the administrative honesty andcapacity necessary to reclaim it.   The Power which detaches those regionsfrom the Ottoman Empire cannot  stop  at that.  By its action it has madeitself morally responsible to humanity and to civilisation for their reclamationand development;  that is to say, it must &quot;either undertake the work  itself  ormake it possible for others to do so.  The extent of the  area  to be detached,and the political and administrative arrangements to be made for  it, mustbe  mainly determined  by  that  consideration.  This  is taken as ah axiomin the following  paragraphs.    VIII. Area to be detached. In the absence of any geographical featureproviding a natural frontier to the north,  any frontier can be nothing morethan a line on  the  map, and there  is thus greater freedom for drawing it inaccordance with  the above-mentioned axiom, which requires  that not moreneed,  and not less must, be taken than is necessary for the  development ofthe country.  There will doubtless be those who will urge that the  simplestcourse is to detach from  Turkey the three vilayets  of Mosul, Bagdad andBasra.   These  vilayets  comprise  the  whole  area,  the  geographical andethnographical unity of which has been illustrated  above.  They include thethree  great trade centres, with the routes leading  to and from them, and thewhole of the upper courses of the Euphrates and Tigris necessary for theirrigation of  the delta.  And they  comprise the very fertile tract north ofthe Jebel Sin jar, which might be regarded as compensation for the wildernesssouth of it,  But there are grave  disadvantages.  The area is very great,over  100,000  square miles.   It is  true that it comprises   a geographicaland ethnological unit; but unfortunately it  does  more than  this, for itcomprises  part  of Kurdistan,  between  the Tigris  and the  Turco-Persianfrontier, and at once raises the Kurd, question in its acutest form.   It hasalready been  suggested that the Kurd  question may  be found to be  thecrux in the future arrangement of eastern Asiatic Turkey, and this is perhapsthe most convenient place to say a few words about it.    If it Avere possible to set up Kurdistan as an independent Avhole, under therule of a Kurd family the problem would be comparatively simple.  But it isnot.  It is understood that there is no suitable family available ; and it is very    S. 262.                          B                                   x
doubtful whether the  real Kurd question,  which  is  mainly  an agrarianquestion, can he solved from within.   There remain only two  alternatives,that Kurdistan should  he either under  the political influence of, or actuallyadministered by, the Powers to the  north or the south of it, i.e., Russia orourselves.   If  it were under  the political influence of Russia, we  shouldnever have a moment&apos;s peace ;  if it were under our own, we should have theimpossible task ol controlling its foreign relations and should be responsiblefor the protection of  Armenia  against Kurdish depredations.   Equallyimpossible for us would be the  task of administration ;  moreover, it is highlyimprobable that  Russia would be content to have a British district on herflank in northern Persia, with undisputed control of  Khanikin and the mostimportant  trade  route into  her Persian sphere.   The only alternative,therefore,  is to  leave Kurdistan  to  Russia  to administer,  wdiich  willbe the  more natural since, through her hold on Azerbaijan,  she will alreadybe responsible  for the Kurds  of north-west Persia.    But  if this is tobe done,  it  will be necessary  also  to hand  over to  her the  Kurdishportion of the  vilayet  of Mosul, so  that  the  whole of  Kurdistan maybe under one control  and administration    This portion  is  bounded bythe Tigris on the Avest, the Persian frontier  on the east,  and the  JebelHamrin on the south, is  extremely  fertile   as  well as petroliferous,  andincludes the important frontier, district of Kiianikin.   It also  includes theAnglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s lands at Chiah-Surkh, as  to which, unless theyare retraceded.  to  Persia, a  special arrangement  with Russia  would  benecessary,   due  Jebel Ilamrin,  as has already been  stated, is a low rangeof hills, and does  not really  form a  natural  frontier;  but it is  at leastclearly marked, and to that extent  better than an  arbitrary line  upon themap.  .    In  order, therefore, to obtain  a  consolidated Kurdistan,  it  has  beennecessary to  remove from the Mosul vilayet the  whole of the area to theeast of Tigris down.to the Jebel Hamrin.   But,  further, for administrativeconvenience, it will also be necessary  to remove from it the  fertile tractnorth of the Jebel Sinjar.  For though, as  already mentioned, this  is partof the pastures of the Shammar Arabs, the  Kurds have also joint rights init, and  descend in the summer months to  cultivate  it.  The  Jebel Sinjarrange itself, is little more of a natural frontier than the Jebel ilamrin though-higher, and in appearance more pretentious- for it is  said to be easy eitherto penetrate or to circumvent.  No  importance  therefore  attaches  to  itspossession, and  since the fertile zone extends very little to  the south of it,and since the region  north, of it has already been  discarded,  there wouldappear to be no purpose  in retaining  more of the wilderness than can beavoided.  The wilderness  itself  in this latitude is  salt, and El  Iiadr, theruins of which still  survive, and which, on.  several occasions  successfullyresisted Roman siege operations, was probably never a centre of cultivation.South of El Hadr the  two rivers begin to  approach one another; and theborder  between, the vilayets  of Mosul  and Bagdad is a line drawn acrossfrom a point a  little below Samarra on  the Tigris to An ah. on the Euphrates.Samarra is some little  distance south of the point at which the Tigris  piercesthe Jebel Hamrin, which is to  form, the frontier  on the left bank; and, ashas already been  mentioned, the ancient irrigation  systems began  at  thatpoint.  It is,  therefore,  suggested  that  a  frontier  may be  made  bydemarcating a line across the wilderness from it  to Anah, a distance ofabout  90  miles,  or  to  Hit,  further south  (2-1-  days&apos;  march).   It isimmaterial which  of   these  two points is   selected, but  it  is  importantto include Hit,  because there  are to  be found there  bitumen, naphtha,and white petroleum, and also  excellent limestone  quarries.  A line drawnhereabouts has  the further advantage of corresponding roughly with  thenorthern limit of the Sawad, or alluvial land  of the delta.    It is not suggested that a line of this kind will not have its. disadvantages.;but it has been shown that in the absence of natural features  the frontier,wherever  it is, can  be nothing but  a line, and  no line that can be drawnseems to  beany better.  One ol: the disadvantages of the  Tekrit-Anah orHit line is that the Southern Shammar  move across it.  It would, however,in any case, be necessary to have this tribe under some kind of loose political-control probably by means of subsidies for the protection of the roads and
of the Bagdad Railway if it is extended from Mosul  southwards. : Similarlyon the west side- in which direction the present vilayet of Bagdad apparentlyextends half-way across the Syrian desert-an arbitrary line would  have tobe  drawn  from Ana or Hit, in a south-east direction, parallel  with theEuphrates  to  the  confines of Koweit,  and  some political control exercisedover the Anaizab, for the protection of the river and the road along its  rightbank.  Within this line the holy places of Kerbela and  Nejef would  formindependent enclaves under Shiah control.   A  rough idea  has  thus been obtained of  what is the largest area thatneed be detached from the Asiatic provinces of Turkey in order to satisfythe axiom  laid down  above ; and  it is found to  be comprised within thefollowing limits :  a line following the Turco-Persian  frontier from  Moham-mera to Kala Null; thence running along the Jebel Hamrin  to the point,Fatha. where the Tigris  cuts that  range; thence straight  across thewilderness to the Euphrates at  Anah or  Hit (inclusive) ; and thence  in asouth-east direction, skirting the desert, to the confines of Koweit,   The next task is to ascertain the smallest area that  can be  taken, regardbeing had to all the conditions.   For example, why not simply detach the town and port of Basra, and theShat-el-Arab   below it?  -Answers to this question  have been  suggestedalready.  (I.)  Basra is  strategically untenable by  itself, as Sir A.  Barretthas already discovered.   Whoever holds  Bagdad, commands  it, and at thevery least Kurna and Nasriyeh must be occupied  as well.   (2.) The  port  ofBasra in itself is of no value.   It is merely the  entrance  to  Mesopotamia.The distributing centre is Bagdad,* and. whoever holds  Bagdad commandsnot only, our  trade with - Mesopotamia  but also   that  with- North-WestPersia.   It  is,  indeed, possible  that if  we  held  Bagdad as  well   asBasra,  the former, would decline in commercial importance in favour of thelatter.  But if they were held,  by different powers, Basra  must always  existon sufferance.   (3.) For commercial purposes, as well  as  for  local security,Amara could not be omitted.   It  is a great wool collecting centre  (Messrs.Lynch have a press there) and has a population of  10,000.   From it wouldbe controlled  the  Beni Lam, who are now attacking  Ahwaz and  the  oilconcession.  (1.) Thus we are committed to Nasriyeh, Kurna, and  Amara,But to secure the irrigation of this.tract, and the navigation of the Shat-el-Arab,control of the irrigation works higher  up is necessary.   (5.)

of the Bagxlad Railway IF IT is extended from Mosul southwards.  Similarlyon the west side- in which direction the present vilayet of Bagdad apparentlyextends half-way across the Syrian desert-an arbitrary line would  have tobe  drawn  from Ana or Hit, in a  south-east direction, parallel with  theEuphrates  to  the  confines of Koweit,  and  some political control exercisedover the Anaizah, for the protection of the river and the  road along its  rightbank.  Within this line the holy places of Kerbela and Nejef would  formindependent enclaves under Shiah control.    A  rough idea  has  THUS been obtained of WHAT  is the largest area thatneed be detached from  the Asiatic provinces  of Turkey in order to satisfythe axiom  laid  down  above ; and it is found to  be comprised within thefollowing limits : a line following the Turco-Persian frontier from  Moham-mera to Kala Nuft; thence running along the Jebel Hamrin  to the point,Fatha.  where  the Tigris  cuts  that  range; thence straight  across thewilderness to  the  Euphrates at  Anah OR  Hit  (inclusive) ;  and thence in asouth-east direction, skirting the desert, to the confines of Koweit.    The next task is to  ascertain  the smallest  area that can  be  taken, regardbeing had to all  the conditions.    For example, why  not simply detach the town and port of Basra, and theSliat-el-Arab  below it?  Answers to this  question  have been suggestedalready.  (I.)  Basra is strategically untenable by  itself, as Sir A.  Barretthas already discovered.  Whoever  holds  Bagdad  commands  it,  and at thevery least Kurna and Nasriyeh. must be occupied as well.   (2.) The  port  ofBasra IN itself is of no value.  It is  merely  the entrance  to  Mesopotamia.The distributing centre is Bagdad,and whoever holds Bagdad  commandsnot  only  our trade with Mesopotamia  but  also  that with  North-WestPersia.    It  is, indeed,  possible  that  if  Ave held  Bagdad  as  well  asBasra, the former WOULD decline  in commercial importance  in  favour of thelatter.   But if they were held  by different powers,  Basra must always existon  sufferance.  (3.) For commercial purposes, as  well as for  local security,Amara could not be omitted.  It is a great  wool  collecting centre  (Messrs.Lynch have a press there) and has a population of 10,000.  From it wouldbe  controlled  the  Beni  Lam, who are now  attacking  Ahwaz  and  the oilconcession.   (4.) Thus AVE are committed to  Nasriyeh,  Kurna, and  Amara.But to secure the irrigation of this tract, and the navigation of the Shat-el-Arab,control of the irrigation AVORKS higher up  is  necessary.   (5.) Thus  the linerecedes inevitably northwards,  until the limit of  the  vilayet  of  Basra isreached, which is roughly a line  from Kut-el-Amara on the Tigris to Nasriyehon the Euphrates.   But this line, whatever may be  its merits as  an internaladministrative division, is open to all the  above-enumerated objections as afrontier.   And the simple fact is that if the axiom that Mesopotamia must bedeveloped is to hold, the area is  not  divisible until  the point  is  reached  atAVHICH the TWO RIVERS enter  THEIR  delta, l.e.,  Beled and Hit; and  AVHEN thatpoint is reached, it is a  convenience, rather  than otherwise, to  include thecomparatively small triangle  of  land comprised,  by the Jebel Hamrin, theTigris, and the 34th parallel.    If therefore the considerations advanced in the foregoing paragraphs  aresound, it results that from whichever point of VIEAVTHE problem is  approachedthe  result  is  the  same, and the  only practicable  area  to  detach is that ofAvhich the line Fatha-Anah or Hit forms the northern limit.

opinion which wishes to be annexed by us.   Aziz. Bey el  Mazri has shownsome anxiety  as  to what  our intentions  are, and has  indicated that  it&quot;annexation is &quot;our policy he cannot help us.   The very loyal Bombay Aloslemp)aper, the  Islamic  Mail, last November expressed  similar misgivings on thepart of Indian Moslems.   The  cry  of jehad having had some success amongthe Arabs (less, perhaps, from conviction, than because they feared Turkishreprisals if they did not respond), it may be more difficult  for them to settleunder a hafir administration than if they had thrown oil&quot; the Turkish  yokefrom the first;  though, as has already been mentioned, they are accustomedto  abrupt  changes and easily adapt  themselves  to a  new  order if  it  isequitable.  There may perhaps  be objections of  an international  nature,though, with  the elimination of Germany, there is no European Power thatcan set up a valid counter-claim.  Russia will doubtless have large ambitions.But she has already staked out a large claim at Constantinople, and on the eastof the Straits, access to which she may require by land, i.c., she may requirenot only Armenia but at least a portion of the Black Sea basin ; and ex hypotliesishe is to have Kurdistan.  She will probably require of  us some assurancesregarding  the free navigation of the Shat-el-Arab, but, when the control  ofthe whole Turco-Persian frontier  down  to  Khanikin  has  been given  toher, she will assuredly have no basis  for territorial  claims to  Mesopotamia itself.    But it.  is at  all events  worth  while to consider possible  lines of lessresistance.  The only alternatives appear to be (I) the creation of an  iude-pendent state;   (2) the establishment of some  kind  of protectorate;  (3)annexation by Persia.    (1.) It  must be  admitted at once that there does not  exist  the materialfor an independent state.   The Arabs have never shown any cohesive power,and there is no  single family or individual whom all the Arabs of Mesopo-tamia would recognise, or who would have  the power to coerce them  intoobedience.  The Sheikhs of  Koweit and Mohammera are  old men, and theirsons men  of no account.  Bin Sand and the Grand Sharif of Mecca are  toofar away.  -Moreover between the former and the  Shanimar  of  Arabia is ahereditary hostility which would probably bring Bin Reshid into the field against him.  The Nakibs of Basra and Bagdad are men of religious but not political influence.  The  Egyptian  pan-Arabs do not seem to be much more than dreamers or agitators, and in any case are not the men lo found a new- state.   Moreover  the Arabs have not so far shown any administrative capacity, and to  hand over the country to them though  it might  be  better than leaving it to the Turks in so  far as self-government, however bad, is better than good government and  a fortiori than  bad  government would not satisfy the axiom laid down above that whoever takes  away Mesopotamia from  the  Turks is responsible to  the civilised  world for  its  reclamation. Except under a  stable administration the necessary inflow of foreign capital could not be expected.    (2.)  The same objections apply to any protectorate which  is a protectorate in anything more  than  name.  For the present purpose three degrees  of protectorate might be  considered.     (a) The conclusion of treaties with local Sheikhs resembling that which is in process of negotiation with Bin Sand.  These  would include  guarantee of protection  against unprovoked aggression by any foreign Power, in return for which the Sheikhs would undertake to have no  dealings with, and grant no concessions to,  Foreign Powers except  by our advice, which advice  must be unreservedly followed.  Coupled with  this there would  have to be an obligation (as in the Aden hinterland) to protect the trade routes.   The effect of such an arrangement would be  to reduce Mesopotamia to the condition of Arabia, and it is difficult to imagine how Bagdad  as a trade  centre could continue to exist.  Incidentally such treaties would be extremely difficult to -enforce without military  operations far  inland, which would be costly  in themselves and bring us in no return; and. the tribes would in practice be at the mercy of  whatever Power chose to tamper with them from the north.     (D) The erection of a  State, on the analogy of an Indian Native State, under  an indigenous  or imported Chief, with a  British  Resident.   The difficulties would be the same as those enumerated  above in  the case of an independent State without a British Resident, with the additional one that
the presence of a  Resident, who could only have  advisory  powers, wouldinvolve a measure of responsibility on us which would be difficult to enforce,and for which we should get no return.   (c)  A puppet ruler with an effective British administration.  If.a manwere forthcoming whose selection for such an invidious  position would giveuniversal  satisfaction,  there  might be something  to  be  said  for  thisalternative, though  in view of the history of Egypt it can hardly be regardedas satisfactory on ITS merits, while as a  political device it is worn somewhatthin.   (3) There  remains the  alternative of annexation by Persia, wdiich is inmany respects the natural heir of Mesopotamia.  It  is attractive, but, surely with the experience we  have had of Persia during the last  quarter of acentury wholly impracticable  in any real sense.   It is not even yet certainthat the Persian Government will be able to hold together such territories asthey already  possess: to  hand over new ones to be  administered by themcould  hardly be justified.  It  is not, however, necessary that the adminis-tration should be Persian, and the analogy of Berar may perhaps furnish asolution of  the problem.   Mesopotamia would be placed  under  Persiansovereignly, but leased to Great Britain in perpetuity for  a substantial rent.Whether  this  arrangement would  prove  workable in  a  case where  thesovereign would be foreign in a sense  in  which the Hyderabad  State  (inwhich the sovereignty of Berar is vested) is not,  requires careful considera-tion.   It  would, certainly  involve great administrative and  internationalinconveniences ; and it would only be practicable on one condition, viz.,  thatthe lease was absolute and perpetual, unattended by any pledges or assurancesregarding  an eventual  rendition, or by  any conditions that would give thesovereign any  right (however shadowy) of  interference in the internal orexternal relations of the leased area.   This would  be the more necessary inthat, if Persia continues to exist as  a nation, she is  bound to come more andmore under the control of Russia.  But  whether it would satisfy the peacockvanity of  Persia is  another question : the amount of the rent would doubtlessexercise an important influence.    The problem in many respects resembles that of the Soudan, after itsreconquest.  But  a similar solution  is  hardly desirable,  even  if  it AVEREpracticable, and it is not practicable because Egypt  in fact undertook certainresponsibilities  towards  the  Soudan which Persia  could  not undertaketowards  Mesopotamia, and annexation in the present case  must be  nothingmore than a fiction, unless it is to defeat its own purpose.   On the AVHOLE thedisadvantages of creating fictions and international  hybrids seem greatly tooutweigh  all  the  advantages ordinarily presented  by the  line  of  leastresistance, and it is submitted that there  is  no practicable  alternative toannexation and direct administration  by Great  Britain.   The  next questionis how this administration should be carried on.    The most obvious course is incorporation in the Indian Empire.  Indiais the nearest British possession, and must be  the  base for  the.  defence ofMesopotamia ;  her  relations with Mesopotamia have always been close  and,through the Political Resident in Bagdad she has come to occupy a foremostplace  in  local politics ;  while the administrative problems awaiting solutionare those with AVHICH precisely the Government of  India are  most familiar. Yet there are grave disadvantauges in adding to  the responsibilities of theGovernment of  India.  Even Burma has always been somewhat of  a  step-child ;  and  a  vast possession, with   almost  inexhaustible  potentialities,separated by the AVHOLE length of the Persian Gulf, could not fail to introduceserious administrative complications into the  already  sufficiently  complexsystem of Indian  Government, and could not expect to receive  the closeattention which AVOULD be the  justification for subordinating it to an  already subordinate  Government.   Moreover,  it is quite conceivable that the nextfew years may see constitutional changes in India of a far-reaching  nature, the result of AVHICH may be AVholly incompatible with the efficient adminis- tration of a colony in the early stages of  its development.   Further, it is fairly certain that the Indian type of administration is not exactly-what is wanted.  The most reasonable constitution would  seem TO be a Governor-General, enjoying the same  measure of independence as the Governor-General of the Soudan ;. and following the same  analogy, it would probably be found      S. 262.                          0
possible to associate  with him, alter the first few years,  a  small advisoiyCouncil.    The area  being  small,  and  the administration  simple,   theEuropean  staff of the  Administrative  Service  would  be too small to  beself-contained  (probably  a dozen men would  suffice); if so, it might  berecruited  in   combination,   and  be  interchangeable   with  the  SoudanCivil  Service.  The controlling  authority  in this country  would  be  theForeign  Office.   The  objection  to this arrangement is  the  difficulty  ofproviding  funds0.  It will probably be some years before the country is self-supporting, and considerable  capital expenditure  will be  necessary at  thevery outset.   There can be no doubt that its  requirements would be moreintelligently and more liberally met by the Government of India than by theTreasury.   But the financial responsibilities of India are  already  sufficientlygreat, and  though she undoubtedly stands to gain greatly by  the  acquisitionof this new possession, it is doubtful whether the application of her revenuesin this direction could be justified.    IX. Protected Area. Some of the considerations bearing upon the  areato  be  administered and the  nature  of  the  administration have  now beensuggested.  But it is clear that if on the one hand it  is  necessary to reducethe area to the narrowest possible  limits, it is on the other hand impossible toleave it-as it. has been left above- -standing in  the middle  of a no-man&apos;s-land.  Nature has provided  it with frontiers to  the south and to the east.But to the  north and west nothing better has been found  than arbitrary linesacross the  wilderness, and it has already been hinted that, for tribal reasons,it will be necessary to extend  our political  control in the  shape of a  definiteprotectorate beyond those  lines.  The next  question is where that control isto stop.  It would seem necessary that it should not stop  until the points arereached at which the control  of other civilized Powers begins.  There mustbe  no ragged edges  in  this settlement, and where we do not now definitelyextend our influence it  is  certain  that the  neighbouring  Powers will extendtheirs.  Those Powers  are Russia and  France.   Russia has already beendiscussed.   If Armenia  and  Kurdistan are to  fall to her,  our protectoratemust extend up to  the foothills  of the Tur Abdin north of  the Jebel Sin jar.As  has already been mentioned,  there  is  no satisfactory dividing line eventhere, for the Kurds come down to that fertile belt in the  summer.  But  thatis probably only a  temporary  state of things which, will  disappear as culti-vation. becomes permanent.   Nisibin,  Mosul (where it will  be necessary  tomaintain a  British Resident),  and the upper waters of the Tigris up to thepoint at which irrigation first becomes possible, would thus  be in our  sphere.This is important,  because  though it  is  improbable that  for  a great manyyears to come  any irrigation north  of the Jebel Hamrin will  be contemplated,it would not be safe  to  allow the upper waters  of the river,  on  which theprosperity  of  the  delta necessarily depends, to  pass  under  the  control ofanother Power.    The trade of Mosul, it has  been suggested, may  find its  outlet  at Alexan-dretta, the  importance of which, as  the outlet of all  the convergent traderoutes of  which  Aleppo is the centre, can hardly  be  exaggerated,  andwhich if we cannot obtain the control of it  ourselves must be ma ie a freeport.  In  this direction our  protectorate will extend  to the  limit of the  Frenchsphere.  What claims the French will put forward  remains  to be seen ; theywill  presumably want  Syria and. probably Palestine.   In  that  case  theEuphrates  from  Biredjik  to  Deir-es-Zor,   thence  southwards to includethe  habitat  of the  Anaizeh, and  so  to  30o  lat.  would perhaps suffi-cientry delimit the British and French spheres ; while 30o lat,  westwards toKoweit would,  mark the limit  towards Arabia proper.   In Arabia difficultiesarise owing to the  hereditary feud between  Bin. Eeshid and Bin Sand, someadjustment of  which,  would seem to be necessary if they are both to findthemselves in  our camp.   We are  already trying  to draw Bin Sand into ourorbit by means of  the treaty  which, as  has  already  been  mentioned, is inprocess of negotiation, and  for the time being, at all events, this necessarilythrows Bin Reshid on to  the other  side.   At present the other side is Turkey ;but in future,  when there is no other party  which has an  interest in playing   * No recent figures are smi.ilable, but in 1908 the revenue of the vilayets of Bugd&amp;d and.Basra was rather under, and the expenditure rather over, 400,0007, sterling.
the one  off against the other, and  when Bin  Saud&apos;s territories have beendelimited under  our auspices, it is  possible  that  this  antinomy may beresolved.   On the west coast of Arabia the  Grand Sharif of Mecca  willprobably throw  off the  Turkish yoke and  makes himself  master of theI Ted jaz.   South of the Hedjaz Ave have promised our diplomatic supportto secure the autonomy of  Seyyid Idrisi in  Asir, and we have concluded aprotectorate treaty with the Mavia Sheikh, at the extreme south of the Yemen.Bui between  Mavia and Idrisi is the Imam Yahya, wdio must in some way orother  be brought  into line  if peace is to reign in the Yemen and in theAden  Hinterland.   The Yemen, indeed, must be regarded as somewhat of adanger point.  It has very great potentialities ; we do not want to annex  itourselves moreover we have solemnly assured  the Arabs of the Yemen thatwe  do not desire to extend our territory ; and  it is quite  certain that Italycovets it.  Now  the Arabs detest Italy more than any other Power, and Avecould not acquiesce in any arrangement that gave her  the Yemen withoutlosing the confidence and goodwill of every Arab from Aden to Mecca.  Onthe other hand there  is no  Arab Avhom Ave  can establish there except theImam, whose claims to it are  pretty Avell founded.  Although, therefore, hehas so far given us no  assistance, Ave shall be bound in self-defence tomaintain him, subject to an adjustment of his claims with those of the Idrisito the north and of Mavia to  the south.   The prolongation of the border of the Aden Protectorate, north-east acrossthe desert to meet a line drawn due south from the neighbourhood of Ojair, AArasaccepted by the Ottoman Government as marking the southernmost limit oftheir claims.  This line will in future presumably serve to delimit the sphere ofBin Sand, who lias made himself the heir  of Ottoman  power in CentralArabia.   This sphere  will require  a little further delimitation  in order tosatisfy the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit which  Avere sacrificed to  politicalexigencies in the recent negotiations with Turkey.   The  coast  district ofKatif, therefore, Avhieh falls to Bin Sand, will end at Jubail-al-Bahri insteadof at Jebel Manila ; the fictitious distinction between inner and outer Koweitwill presumably be abolished; and  Urn  Kasr  and  Safwan in  the northrestored to the Sheikh.   South  of  the  line  across the desert the  whole of the coast  of Arabia isalready  under our undivided influence, except  El Katr (with Avhose Sheikhthe Government of  India  have been  authorised  to conclude a treaty) andMuscat, whose independence is jointly guaranteed by France and ourselves.If the price  asked is  not too high, it Avould  be worth  while  to  use thisopportunity to eliminate France of Muscat.    A  further Avord must  be  said about the Hedjaz.  It has been a principleof our policy to leave the Caliphate to  take care of itself  as a matter ofpurely domestic  concern to Mussulmans;  but we  have  made  no publicannouncement on the subject.   If the dc facto possessor of the Holy Placesis Caliph, and if  the Grand Sharif of Mecca definitely dissociates himselffrom the Turks, he will ipso  facto become Caliph, at all events temporarily ;and Avhen Turkey&apos;s AVINGS have been clipped, as  it presumed that they willbe,  there will be no  Mussalman  PoAver possessing both  the will  and thepower to  eject him.   The only source of possible danger to him will beArabia itself.  But in  Arabia the only Chief capable of disputing his claimis Bin Sand, and Captain Shakespear, in a report written shortly  before hisdeath, has assured us that &quot; AVE have little need to fear an attempt on the part ofBin Sand or his family to arrogate this title.&quot;   The Wahabis only acknowledgethe first four Caliphs, and the  trend of Arab opinion, as  Captain Shakespearheard it expressed, was that, if, as appeared  to lie anticipated, EnA*er Pashashould displace the present Sultan, &quot; the Caliphate will  by common consent&quot; of Islam revert  to the descendants of the  Prophets  family  in  Mecca,&quot; of AADIOM the present head is the Sharif, ANDAADIO I feel sure AArould command&quot; Bin Saud&apos;s  support in such an event rather than his antagonism.&quot;   In that case the question AVILL have  solved itself, as AVE desire, and  infavour of a candidate Avhom Ave have guaranteed against attack.   The upshot of these considerations is thus a British protectorate over halfthe Syrian Avilderness  and  the whole of  Arabia.  If  this sounds ratherformidable, a little further examination of AVHAT  is meant by &quot;protectorate &quot;in this connection will dispel anxiety.   It has been sliOAvn above that, in theabsence of a natural frontier  for the administered area in Mesopotamia, and
in view  of  the nomadic character  of the neighbouring&quot; tribes, a  definiteprotectorate in the immediate neighbourhood is the  only alternative to theannexation of  a much  larger area.  Northwards,  therefore,  of  the Fatha-Ana line, and westwards of the Euphrates, agreements with  the tribes arenecessary in order to secure the trade routes, whether roads  or railways, toregulate pasture rights, and to prevent those tribes from becoming instrumentsof intrigue in the hands  of  possibly unscrupulous neighbours.  This  muchmust be undertaken, whatever happens to Arabia.   But when we  come to Arabia  itself  the  position is very different.   Wealready, stand in treaty relations  with the whole of the East and South  Coastof Arabia from Koweit to Aden,  and they are essential to the security of ourposition  in the Persian Gulf and to our communications with India.   Butexcept on the coast there is no reason why we should come into contact withthe tribes at all.  For in the interior we  have no interests whatever, and thetreaty which is now being negotiated with Bin Sand has been necessitated solelyby the fact of his recent acquisition of the Katif Coast.   We have neither thedesire  nor the power to interfere with the Chiefs  of the interior, and, whatis more important, the Chiefs of the interior  have  not the slightest intentionof allowing themselves  to be interfered  with.  What the)&apos;  want.....-and it isprobably true to say  of them, as  Captain  Shakespear has said  of Bin  Sand,though doubtless  in varying  degrees, that they are &quot;  animated by intense&quot; patriotism for [their] country, a profound veneration for [their]   religion,&quot; and a single-minded  desire to do  [their] best for  [their] people &quot;- whatthey want is &quot; Arabia for the Arabs &quot; ; and all they want of us  is a guaranteeagainst attack  by sea and our good ollices in securing their independence inthe settlement  at the end of the war.   This,  it is submitted, we are  in aposition to give them-we  have indeed already  promised  it  to Bin  Sand,Mavia. the Idrisi, and the Sharif  of Mecca, and  it is less, rather  than more,dangerous to complete the network of agreements.   The &quot;&apos; protectorate &quot; overArabia therefore amounts to nothing more than Arabia for the Arabs underthe tegis  of Great Britain.   X.  Persia. The  Mesopotamian question necessarily raises that of Persia,if only because, as we are at this moment learning  to our cost,  the neutralityor occupation of Arabistan and Luristan are essential, to the security of Basra.Moreover, it is obvious  that if Russia, who already dominates  Azerbaijan, isplaced in possession  of the whole of  the Turkish side of the frontier  down toKhanikin, her hold on northern Persia will be immensely strengthened.  Now,therefore, is the time to come  to terms with her.  It is submitted  that theexperience of the last seven  years proves conclusively that no settlement canbe satisfactory which does  not  eliminate  the  neutral  zone.  There was atwo-fold  reason for creating that zone : (1) to avoid  an  undue extension ofour responsibilities, (2) to avoid  a conterminous frontier with Russia.   Theacquisition of  the Anglo-Persian oil-fields at the  other end of Persia hasstultified the first.  The  second  is one of  those superstitions which lingeron  in  offices  long  after they  have lost  all  reality in practice.  If  theexperience of the last half century in the East teaches anything,  it is surelythe futility of the buffer-State, and,  a  fortiori,  of the buffer-zone.   Thescheme that has been  outlined above for the re-arrangement of  EasternTurkey in Asia aims at  the elimination of  the buffer-State, and  is intendedto leave no neutral zones or no-mans-lands ; and it is believed that we shallonly get  rid of friction in Persia by doing the same there.  But the abolitionof the neutral zone can only be effective for this purpose if there is  theclearest possible understanding  that  each Power is free to do what  it likesin its own.   But the difficulty as has been more than  once  urged is to arrive  atan equitable division of  the neutral  sphere.  For  our interests  are so dis-tributed  over it geographically that there would seem to be almost  nothingwith  which we  can afford to  part,  In  the extreme  west  Luristan andArabistan  are  essential  to  the  security of lower  Mesopotamia,  as  well  asbeing  the region  in which 2,000,0001  have recently  been  sunk.   In  thecentre, it is difficult to see hotv we can give Russia anything south of Ispahanwithout bringing her down  in dangerous proximity to the Gulf, and at thesame time cutting off our own access  to the north, whether via Ahwaz-lspahanor Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan.   In the extreme east there is nothing that we can
give without bringing Russia a stage nearer Seistan, and placing a long stripof Afghan frontier in the rear of Herat  in  her possession.  It is perhapspossible  to over-estimate the substantial disadvantages  that  this  wouldentail  to ourselves,  but  it is  quite certain  that  it would have  the  worstpossible effect on the  Amir.   Indeed, so far from being able to give anything to Russia, it is a questionwhether an attempt should not be made to get Ispahan away from her.  Thesecurity  of  the  oil-fields, peace in Arabistan, the protection  of  the  Lynchroad and of our trade along it, are some of the advantages which we  derivefrom  the loyalty of the Bakhtiaris, audit  would seem inevitable, if Ispahanremains in the Russian  sphere, that the  Bakhtiaris should sooner or  latersuccumb to Russian influence.   M. Sazonof said to Sir (jr. Buchanan  in January that  Russia already hasall she wants in Persia, except, of course, the  free hand to dispose of it as shepleases.  If the free hand is  now accorded to her, and if account is taken ofthe extraordinarily rich tract which it is proposed to relinquish to her on theTurco-Persian frontier, it is  conceivable that she may be content to  leaveIspahan  and  the neutral sphere  to  us.   In  any  case it would  seem  best,seeing that it is she who is pressing for its abolition, to let her make herproposals first.                                                                 A.

HirtzeVs minute  on  the  political future of Mesopotamia and theadjoining  provinces of the Turkish. Empire demands an appreciation of themilitary conditions affecting the problem, and he has  therefore  asked meto state my views.  I will endeavour to do so as briefly as possible, but I canhardly confine myself to the geographical limits of his minute, as 1 am awarethat the question of  Alexandretta, and its connection with the problem ofthe Trans-Continental Railwa\r to  the  Persian  Gulf, is being raised.  Thereare those who think that the control of the railway from the Mediterraneanto the Gulf should be in our hands, and that, with this object, it is necessaryto acquire the admirable naval and strategic position of  Alexandretta, whichnot only enfilades the coasts of Asia  Minor and Syria, but menaces on theother hand the historic  Cilician Gates,  between Asia Magna  and Asia Minor,and on the  other the  routes  to  Antioch,  Aleppo,  Mosul,  Diarbekir, andErzeroum.  The idea of holding  this dominating position is a fascinatingone, but our  possession of so commanding a situation, threatening both thecontemplated French sphere in Syria  and the prospective Russian spherein  Armenia, would  sooner or later,  but inevitably, bring  our  interestsinto  conflict  with those  of  our  great  allies of to-day.   This powerfulconsideration compels me  to reject  as an untenable  military  and politicalproposition,  the  alluring  but  dangerous  idea of establishing  ourselves  atAlexandretta; a  position  which would commit us to military and adminis-trrative obligations far beyond the limitations imposed on us by both ourresources and our world-wide responsibilities,  ff  we annex  Alexandrettawe shall not only  involve  ourselves in enormous and unprofitable expenditurein docks and fortifications, but we shall also  be committed to the control anddefence of the long exposed line of the Baghdad Railway between that portand  Mosul,  while at  the same  time  we shall be perpetually flounderingS. 262.D
in a maze of intricate political intrigues and racial problems-Kurd  andArmenian, Anatolian and Syrian with which we ought to have no concern.Mesopotamia and Egypt, with Palestine as the connecting link between thetwo, are  British interests,  the rest  are not.  Let us, therefore, restrict *our aspirations and our energies to obtaining a controlling influence over theArab  world, and thus becoming  in fact as well as in theory the leading-Islamic Power, the one on which all Islamic  races will  lean,  if  the  aboveview is accepted where short of the Alexandretta-Mdsul line should we seek&apos;the ideal northern boundary of  our sphere in  Eastern Asia ?   From a purelyBritish point of  view that line might be  one stretching  from  the  Medi-terranean at Cape Nakurah, between Tyre and Acre, to the  Euphrates at ornear Deir, thence down  the right bank  to  Anah and across El Jazirah towhere  the Tigris cuts through the Jabal Hamrin  and along that low butwell defined range to  the Persian frontier.  Such, a line would include  allPalestine from Dan to Beersheba, the  Upper Jordan and Mount Hermon, aswell as the oases  of Damascus and Palmyra, and thus enable  us to constructan all-British railway  from Acre or Haifa  through Damascus to Baghdad and.the Gulf, thus enabling  us  to connect with the Egyptian system,  embracingall the Arab region  and linking up and  consolidating our oriental empire.If,  however, this ambitious programme  is  beyond our  military capacityand likely to involve us  in a conflict with France, the only sound alternativeis to reconcile ourselves  to acquiring  a supreme influence in  Mesopotamia,abandoning  all idea of linking up with the railway systems of Turkey andEgypt, and  confining ourselves  to  the development of ancient Ghaldea.With  our maritime base at Basra, or Koweit, a railway link with Europeis not  absolutely essential,  and there are  certain advantages in holding-Mesopotamia as  a self-contained province more or less isolated from theWestern world,  and  consecpiently  defended  with  comparative  ease  fromexternal enemies.    Personally&apos;! incline to the view that this is the course we should adopt,and this also is, I think, the view advocated  by Sir A. Hirtzel  at  page 6 ofhis minute,  but, though I. agree generally with him as to the Northern limitof our sphere of  action, I &apos;do not altogether accept his  conclusions, becauseI am doubtful of  the wisdom of incorporating the whole of  this  region inthe British. Empire.   I am. doubtful for three reason, (1) because  we  shouldalienate the Arabs, and  make perpetual  foes of the Turks ;  (2) because weshould  render all Mahomedans suspicious of our policy ;  (3) because themilitary defence  of upper as well as  lower Mesopotamia would be thrownentirely on us, and I doubt if we can  bear the burden without an excessivestrain on our military resources.  The lesson of the decline and fall of Rometeaches the necessity of avoiding over  extension.    Influenced by these grave doubts my conclusion  is that we should limitannexation to so much of the Basra &quot;  wilayat &quot; as is  essential  for militaryreasons, and, that as regards the rest we should leave the nominal  suzeraintyto the Sultan  of Turkey, coupled&apos;with  the  condition  of a  British  HighCommissioner or Governor-General of Baghdad  and a supervising  Britishadministration.    In fact the Sultan of  Turkey as regards Mesopotamia wouldbe  in.  much the  same position as he was in relation to Egypt, and  the  Basra&quot;wilayat &quot;would be  in  a somewhat  corresponding  position to the Soudan,except that it woidd be entirely British territory.    The advantages of this course are :      (1) That we should conciliate  Mahomedan opinion, and give an opening         to  educated Arabs and other  Mahomedans.    (2) That we  should to a certain extent  save Turkish amour pmprc  and         help to rehabilitate Turkey as an Asiatic State.    (3) That we should not arouse the jealousies and suspicions  of  Russia         and France,  as we probably should if wo occupied Alexandretta.    (4) That we should create a territorial buffer between ourselves and both         Russia and  France, as the one will  presumably lie established in         Armenia and possibly part of Kurdistan, the other in the Lebanon.    (5) That this buffer province will be dependent on us for its  continued         existence as  without our support it would certainly be absorbed.    (6) That the  military defence of  lower Mesopotamia will then  be well-         within the scope of oar military  potentialities.
      I am well aware that  buffer States  are  not  eternal, but still, while they   last, they serve  a  useful purpose.  Siam  and Afghanistan have been buffer   States for more than a quarter of a century, and there is no visible  sign of   their early dissolution.   Similarly, Upper  Mesopotamia  may  form  such  a   barrier for a generation,  and we cannot legislate for all futurity.  It is the   military aspect of  the case with which I am more particularly concerned, and   therefore I now turn to its consideration, taking as a basis  the policy outlined*   above.                                   i      1 have said that  we  should annex outright  the  Basra &quot; wilayat.&quot;  The   corollary to this is that we should have to provide entirely for its defence.   This, I think, would be well within our  capacity if we were separated, as we   should be, by at least 500 miles from the nearest military power Russia    much of the intervening space being a desert without population or resources.   The separation would  be  all the more advantageous to us if unbridged by   any trunk line of railway.  Our principal  cantonments would presumably be   at  Kut-el-Amara and Basra, with  minor garrisons  at  Kurna, Amara, and   Xasireh.  An Anglo-Indian division would  be ample for this purpose, even   if it had to assume responsibilities for the defence of the Karun Valley and   the Anglo-Persian oil field.      Then as regards the Baghdad wilayat we should probably want a central   cantonment at or near Baghdad, with outlying posts to protect the head works   of  the  great irrigation system which would  doubtless be  initiated  in the   province,  as well perhaps  as a post  to protect the highway to Persia through   Khanakin.   The forces required for these  purposes might be furnished from   indigenous sources, just as in Egypt, with a nucleus of Anglo-Indian troops   to ensure  the maintenance of our military supremacy.  A mixed brigade of   British and Indian troops  would probably  suffice for this special object.      1 will not lengthen this Minute by further  discussion of the details of  a   subject which  is  at  present more or less academic, and perhaps unhappily   somewhat  premature,  but will  content myself  with merely recapitulating   what I conceive should be the main points of our  policy towards Turkey in   the eventuality of an early peace :       (I.) Turkey in Asia to be maintained as  a buffer State, but  shorn of the           following provinces : Armenia,  which would  necessarily  go to           Russia, the  Lebanon which would be  claimed by France, and the           Basra  wilayat which  would  be annexed  by England,  while the           Uejaz  and  Yemen  would  be  divided  between  Egypt and certain           friendly  Arab Emirs such as the Jdrisi and Lahej.      (2.) The Baghdad wilayat to be transformed into an autonomous province           administered in  the name of the  Sultan by a British Administrator           and under British protection and on the same lines as  Egypt.      (3.) Palestine  to be neutralised, and  administered as  an autonomous           province of the Turkish Empire by an International Commission or           Corporation under the protection of the allied Powers.   We  have  a           somewhat similar example in the case of Shanghai, though of course           on a much smaller scale.      (4.) Both Baghdad and Palestine, as also  Armenia and the Lebanon, to           take over proportionate shares in the Turkish debt.      (5.) The Sulfan&apos;s private estates and interests in  the Baghdad wilayat to           be respected.      (G.) All the German  concessions and  interests  in Asiatic Turkey to be           cancelled,  those in Baghdad and  Basra   being   transferred to           Great Britain, and those in Palestine to the neutralised autonomous           province.      (7.) Great  Britain to  be entirely  responsible  for the  defence  of the           Baghdad province, and for its political relations with Persia  and           Arabia.      (8.) German interests  in Anatolia and Northern Syria  to  be transferred           to  Turkey which  would  thus become possessed of  the so-called           Baghdad Railway in those provinces.      The solution here suggested may be far  short of  British aspirations, but   it  seems  to me that we  must try to adjust our demands to our means  and   necessities, and in my judgment demands which exceed our financial  and
military  capacities  should be AAWIEEL, while we  should endeavour as  faras possible, to pose as the champion of Islam, by maintaining Turkey as anAsiatic State, and  by enhancing the power  and prestige of the Sultan ofEgypt, and of the Arabian Emirs.   The  abolition  of  direct.  Turkish  rule in  Palestine  is also a politicalconsummation which will appeal to many, both Christian and Jew, but whichwould inevitably create dissension  among the Powers unless they were allequally interested  in the  new dispensation.   Any attempt to acquire aspecial privileged position by one would be  resented  by the  rest,  of  thePowers and would speedily lead  to that  Armageddon  in the Valley ofEsdraelon which has terrified the imagination of the world for ages past.      ;:                                                      E. G. 13.   Kith March 191 a. &apos;               COMMENTS OX  SIR EDMUND BARUOW\S NOTK.   It will have been seen that in Sir E.  Barrow&apos;s opinion the defence of thearea which, it had been proposed in the  preceeding notes to annex, is withinour powrers.  Erom  the military  point  of  view, therefore, it is immaterialwhether the Bagdad vilayet is annexed or protected,  since in either case wemust, and can, defend it.   The military question  on which Sir  E. Barrowhas doubts is our power to defend Upper Mesopotamia, i.e., the area north ofthe Fatha-Anah line, single-handed.  To defend it, we  must presumably goup to meet the Russians in the defiles of  the Bitlis and Wazna passes, whichis  clearly impossible unless  we hold Alexandretta  and the hinterland (aproposal which Sir  ,.E. Barrow  criticises adversely, but which had not  beenmade by me).   And. that is one of the  reasons why I had not proposed toannex Upper  Mesopotamia.  But if it  is  not annexed,  but merely left asa protectorate, is it necessary  to  defend it  ?  As has  already been pointedout. the country from  the  Jebel Sinjar southwards  is a  wilderness,  andlikely to remain so, except in. the immediate neighbourhood  of  the  riverbanks.  Why not leave it empty,  merely subsidising  the tribes  for the pro-tectioh of the trade routes  in time of peace?  The temporary loss of Mosuland the fertile territory north  of the Jebel Sinjar  would be  inconvenient.But in an Empire like ours  it is  impossible to defend everything at once.Moreover, is it certain that,  under Sir E. Barrow&apos;s  proposals, the Turks willbe  able to defend it for us?   With only Anatolia  left to her,  although herbest troops  are  drawn  from there,  Turkey will in  future be much  lessconsiderable  as  a  military  power, and  in  the event  of war with  Russia itwould seem that her hands  must be pretty full elsewhere,    But altogether apart from the military question, what  is really uppermostin Sir E.  Barrow&apos;s  mind is evidently the  cptestion of  policy.   For politicalreasons he wishes  to  rehabilitate Turkey.  It had been  assumed  as thebasis of the preceding notes that our  object  is to  do the  exact  opposite.It is some years now since it was discovered that the Turk was &quot; the wronghorse,&quot; and nothing has  happened since to weaken  the force of  thatdiscovery.   Moreover,, owing to the  turn which events  have taken, it hasbecome necessary for us to choose finally between  Turk and Arab.  Therecan surely be no compromise.   In Egypt, on the shores of the Red Sea andthe  Persian Gulf, in Mesopotamia, we must in future depend on  the good-will of  the Arab, and it seems certain  that we cannot count on that if weare seen to be rehabilitating his deadly enemy.   Further, it would be necessaryto  guarantee  the Turk in  the possession  of the Holy Places,  which musthave a very unfortunate effect  on the Grand Sharif of Mecca and his Arabconnections.    Again,  Sir  E.  Barrow&apos;s proposal   will give  the  Turk  control  notonly of the  Shammar,  who wander in and out of our northern  frontier,but of  the Anaizah and the  tribes  of the Syrian  desert on our  flank,and will  leave  Northern  and Central. Arabia open  to  their  intrigues.There  can surely  be  no &quot;peace on   that  basis.  But,  it  is  said,  theTurk  will  be  ex  hypotlicsi   our  friend,  and  will  not  intrigue.  Has
there ever been a time when the Turk has not intrigued ?  It  was preciselyat the period when our friendship  with Turkey was greatest,  that Turkishexpansion in eastern Arabia began, and intrigues were initiated which havecontinued unceasingly ever since,   fs there any reason to suppose that wdienwre have helped to turn the Turk out of Constantinople and  strip him of  hisrichest provinces, his feelings towards us will be so revolutionised that  hisvery nature  will  be  changed &apos;?  I do not  think that anyone  who has haddirect  experience of  the attempt to work harmoniously with Turkey at  thehead  of  the  Persian Gulf during  the  last cpiarter of a century,  wouldchoose her  for a neighbour.   In this connection,  the case of Egypt seemsto be a warning rather than  an  example.  Apart from the  fact  that  theanomalies of the status of Egypt were so iuconvenient as not to  encourage areproduction of  them  in Mesopotamia, the fact  that  Turkey  has  neveracquiesced in  our occupation  and has persistently and not unsuccessfullyintrigued against it, seems to be a clear indication of  what may be expectedto happen in Bagdad if any locus standi is given to the Turkish Government.The politico-religious advantages claimed for Sir E. Barrow&apos;s scheme seem tobe based on  the identification of Turkey with Islam.   It  is probable that inIndia at the  present moment the two are convertible terms.  But are theyso outside India ?  In Arabia and Africa will not the overwhelming majorityalmost certainly be for an Arab Caliphate, if on the  fall of Constantinoplethe Grand Sharif throws off the  Turkish yoke and proclaims himself possessorof the Holy  Places ?   As has already been pointed out, it will be beyond  thepower of Turkey to eject him, and Indian  Mussulmans -will have to  choosewhich Caliph they will serve.   As access to the Holy Places will depend  onthe goodwill of the Grand Sharif, there can be little doubt which  Avay theirchoice will eventually go.  There will, no doubt, be an uncomfortable period ofsuspense and hesitation ; but when it is once realised that we  do not intendto interfere  in Arabia, and that the  Holy Places there and in Mesopotamiaare secure against Christian intrusion, it  seems highly probablejthat  IndianMussulmans will understand that there is nothing anti-Islamic  in our  policy,and-will acquiesce.    For the above reasons, therefore,  it is  submitted  that the  rehabilitationof Turkey has nothing to commend it, and that the scheme outlined  in  thepreceding notes, though assuredly not &quot;without  it  weak points, is the mostsatisfactory  that can be  found.    Of  course,  if  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government are  prepared to  annexAlexandretta and the whole country from  the Persian Gulf to  the foothillsof  the Anti-Taurus,  and  to  defend it  when annexed, that would be verymuch better.  But it  has been assumed that this is too large a responsibility,and though  I do not share Sir  E. Barrdw&apos;s political objections to the scheme;I think that it is more than we ought to undertake.   17th March 1915.                                              A. II.       TELEGRAM FROM  VICEROY TO SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR INDIA,                        DATED 15TH MARCH 1915.   Private.  Most secret.  Your  private telegram  of 10th March.   In myprivate letter  of 3rd March, which you should receive  about 27th  March,I enclosed a  note  containing fully my views  on the  future  status andadministration of Basra.  I confined my remarks to the future of Mesopotamia,since any discussion of policy outside these limits might have been regardedas outside my legitimate sphere.   My opinion in a few words is that, varied (?) as. our interests  are atAbadan and in Karun valley by the oil works and  oil fields, it is essentialthat  for this and other reasons we should  remain in permanent occupationof Basra vilayet, and that on political, economic and religious grounds theBagdad vilayet should also be  ceded by Turkey and a native administrationunder  our protection  and. control established  there.   What  form thatadministration  should take could hardly  be decided at present owing  tothere being no  really  predominant ruling factor  in  the whole of eastern    S. 262.                          E
ISMesopotamia.   H and when we get to  Bagdad  the solution  of  this questionis  likely to prove  easier than it looks  at  present.  A  temporary solution-might  be the creation of a Council of Sunni  and Shiah Ulemas  under thedirection of a Resident.   Our Bagdad protectorate should extend north of Samara (  &apos;?  which isa  ?  ) religious centre and should comprise Khanikin on the trade route toPersia.   1 am averse from increasing our military  responsibilities  more than isabsolutely  necessary, but  the situation has  to be faced,  and it must  berealised that with an unfriendly Government at  Bagdad our political, militaryand commercial position at Basra might become very difficult.   In my note  I advocated as  a  condition of peace the  transfer to  Britishhands  of the whole property of  Bagdad Railway Company, its rights andprivileges,  leaving  Turkey to arrange for indemnification  of  German andother shareholders.   This should  in any case apply to such extension  of therailway as  will pass through territory  annexed or controlled  by us afterthe war.  You mention  that War Office and Admiralty insist cm importance of acquiringAlexandretta as safeguarding possession of Mespotamia by control of  railwayterminus.  I would only remark that the possession of Alexandretta withoutthe hinterland  as far  as  Aleppo would  not help  us to  control the BagdadRailway, which throws out branches at various points to the  sea, but runswell  inland the  whole way from Ismidt to Bagdad.   From a  military point of view it would probably be to our  advantage inMesopotamia that the section  of the railway  from Jerablus to Bagdad shouldnever be built,  or certainly not for several years.   As   regards your enquiry  of  my opinion as to the genera] area whichshould be left  to Turkey after claims of  belligerents  have been satisfied,I presume  that Russia  will take  Erzerouin and Van,  Constantinople, andany further strip  of  territory on the Asiatic shore of the Bosporus.  Francewill  at least claim Syria  and Palestine  as  her sphere of influence direct orindirect.   The vilayets of Khat^iiBitlis and Diarbekir will probably becomean autonomous  Armenia,  Thus  Turkey  would  practically be shut off fromMesopotamia and.  Syria.   Konia would probably become  the seat of TurkishGovernment, and  round Konia there are several provinces predominatinglyTurkish, and these might form a respectable Turkish State.   The future of Khalifate and of Arabia is a  question  which should  settleitself Avith  a  benevolent attitude  on  our  part but  Avith as little  outsideinterference as  possible.   In return for important concessions made to Russia in Turkey, would itnot be possible  to induce her  to relax her hold on northern Persia and to givePersia a chance?  This would suit us far better than any partition.  Anyhow,the future  of Persia must be, I think, taken  into  serious  consideration inconjunction with the future of what is now Asiatic Turkey.   Lastly, I trust in any scheme  of mutual  agreement between the allies asettlement of  the  question of  the French possessions in India will not beforgotten.
