Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  December 1915.SECRET. G.-46.WAR  COMMITTEE.Meeting held  at 10,  Downing  Street,  on  Thursday,          December 16,  1915, at 11*30 A.M.Evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, Bart., M.P.,                  on the Arab Question.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,           December 17, 1915.
EVIDENCE  OF  LIEUTENANT-COLONEL SIR MARK SYKES, BAKT., M.P.,                        ON THE ARAB  QUESTION.     1. THE PRIME MINISTER: Sir Mark Sykes, you have been good enough tocome and give us your views on the Arab question.   You have been very recently inthis part of  the world : where have you been ? A.  I went to Sofia for a short time,then to  the &quot;Headquarters  at the  Dardanelles.  Erom there I went  to Alexandria,from there to Aden, then back to Egypt, then back to Aden, then to Simla, and  thenI was eight weeks with the Mesopotamia Field Force,  and called at all the PersianGulf ports on both sides.  I stayed about a week in Egypt on my way hack, I missedthe connection.   I sent a Memorandum, which has been  circulated, which gave whatI had observed until the 28th October;  but, of course, subsequent events have alteredanything one had to say on military questions, though, I think, the  political questionsremain as they were before.  With regard to the Arab question, the fire, the spiritual fire,lies in Arabia proper, the intellect and the organising power lie iu Syria and Palestine,centred particularly at Beirut.   I should like  also to mention that the intellectualmovement, which is behind the Arab movement,  is  not revolutionary like the  YoungTurk, because education in Syria, unlike modern education in India  and in Turkey,has  been confined in Syria to the property-owning classes,  and consequently youhave not a lot of very poor men who have got a little education and greater ambitions.That is an  important point  with regard to  the intellectual force at the back of thismovement.     In  the  Mosul district the movement is influenced by the Kurds, but east of theTigris the Kurds are  pro-Arab.  If we come to the region of Diarbekir, and to thatnorth of Aleppo, the Arab movement is  spoiled to  a great extent  by  the Armenianquestion and by Turkish influence.   It is spoiled in this way that there is not somuch chance of co-operation between Christian and Moslem, and the Turk gets someArabs on the Turkish side  against the Arabs.  In Mesopotamia, as  I put  in  myMemorandum, the Arabs round Kerbela and to the  south of Bagdad are very muchcut off from the rest of the Arab movement by Shiism by the Shia religion.   Theyhave a certain sense of race and  breed, but  they  do  not  fall in with  the otherpeople.     2. THE PRIME  MINISTER: Are the Arabs  all  Sunnis ? A.  Practically therest of the Arabs, except at Kerbela and south of Bagdad, are all Sunnis.     8. LORD KITCHENER: Wahabism, does that still exist ? A. I think  it is adying force.     4 MR.  LLOYD  GEORGE :  Is that a Mohammedan sect ? A.  It is a Sunnisect.  With  regard to the organisation, the motive force, like the Committee of Unionand Progress, is in the army.   I have talked to a  great many army officers, prisoners ofwar, from the Damascus corps, from  Mosul  and from Bagdad, and they seem all atone, though, of course, they are frightened by the Committee of Union and Progress.They all have hostages in Turkish hands wives and children, who would be sacrificedif they came out with very much support.  With  regard to the Kurdish officers,coming; from the east of the Tigris, I think they are nearly all at  one  with the Arabofficers.&apos;  The ideal, running through nearly all the military members  of the organi-sation, is, nationalism and religious equality.  All  the officers I have spoken to wantto bring fa the Arab-speaking Christians and to give  them religious equality.   Thatis a strong feeling.    ,6. MR. BALEOUR:  Equality with  the  Mohammedans ?-A. Yes, the  Arabarmy officers want to establish  an Arab State in  which the Christians  shall berecognised as Arabs first, and not to go on religious  lines.   The second force is that ofthe Syrian Christians, like Dr. Paris Nimr  and  others, and certain Syrian Moslemintellectuals,  and a few religious leaders who, I think, are very fine people, like theG:and Mufti at Damascus, who protested against the order  of  retaliation  on local
Christians.  They, also, have the same ideas as the army officers.   A third force is theuneducated notables at places like Harna, Horns, Bagdad, and Nablus, who are bigoted,and who want to establish an Arab State which shall be a Mohammedan State, and agood  many of the Ulema and religious  leaders are on their side.   That is the oldschool.   The last force is  the Arabs  of  Hejaz.   Wherever they are, nomadic  Arabs,there it is a sense of breed, and they are not fanatical, and they would fall in with theSherif, as would also a large section of the Kurds.  There  are two common factors tothe whole of the four of those schools of thought.  One is^ that they must ask fortheoretical independence, otherwise, if they ask for an obvious European tutelage, theCommittee of  Union  and Progress will take  the  reactionary party over on their  side.The other is that practically all the Arabs are pro-English and not anti-Erench, butfrightened of the Erench.  They have obtained a great deal of their culture  from theErench., but they are  frightened of financial exploitation,  and they are frightened ofErench colonial methods : that is, bringing a  lot of Erench, Italians,  Portuguese, andother people to colonise;  and the Christians are  as afraid of them at the bottomof their hearts as the  Moslems.  They like  the French, they like French culture, butthey are frightened of French methods.    6. LORD  KITCHENER: Do you  speak of  Syria?-A. That feeling,  Sir, isprevalent everywhere, because there has  been so much propaganda  by Syrians, andthey know what the French do, so that feeling runs pretty well  all through.   If Imay say so, the chief difficulty seems to be the French difficulty, and the root of that,I think, to  speak frankly, lies in Franco-Levantine  finance.  Vitali represents theFrench group which used to be at Constantinople, who is in touch with M. Hugenin,who is a Swiss, and he is in touch  with  the  Bagdad Railway, and they have  had agreat many relations with Javid.  They have obtained the  Syrian railways, and  thatvery big loan of 1914, which gave them immense concessions all over Turkey.   Nowthat party,  I feel, is working through  two  agencies, and is checking the Ententepolicy in the Near East.  One is the French cleric, which is sentiment.    7. THE PRIME  MINISTER : What is that ?-A. The French Nationalist party,which is sentimental, bearing in mind  the  crusades.  I  think  that that  financialgroup works upon a perfectly honest sentiment.  On the other side, they work  on thefears of the Erench colonial  party of an  Arab Khalifate, which will  have a  commonlanguage with the Arabs in Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco.  The Erench machinery inTunis, Algeria, and Morocco has been very satisfactory, but they  are  afraid,  I  think,of a  Khalifate, or an independent State,  speaking the same - language  as theirMohammedans.   I think at the back of all this, the influence that is moving  them, issinister.  I think that the financiers have three objects : I think they believe that ifthe Entente  wins they  want to  have   Syria, Palestine,  and North  Mesopotamia.M. Picofs request for the vilayet of Mosul suggests to me that they  want also to getthe Suj Bulak Pass and link up with the Trans-Persian Railway.   I think that is theirambition if the Entente wins.   I think their ambition, if the Entente fights only  to adraw, is to maintain  Turkey intact, and work  the 1914  concessions that were  got onthat loan, and the Syrian railways, for all they are worth.   I believe  that they  think,that, if the Entente loses the game, they will be able to square, through M. Hugenin,with the Germans later on.  That is my feeling of what I  take to be a very evil forceworking two honest forces, which are unconscious of the real purport of it.   I  think,to meet that, we require diplomacy which would be able to show great sympathy withthe clerical feeling in France, and to point out that if matters are allowed to driftthey will lose their real anchorage in Syria, owing to the anticipated  massacre  of theSyrian Christians  in the same way that the Armenians were massacred.   I  think itshould be pointed out  to the Erench colonial party that, if the Arabs  come under theinfluence of the Committee of Union and Progress, they will be much more formidableto them than they will under their own Sherif, when they will be quarrelling amongstthemselves, as they always do.                                  -    Lastly, I come to the  Indian Moslems.   With regard to the Indian Moslemsthere is an anti-Arab  feeling in India;  that is undoubted.  I think it is almost anatural dislike which  exists between Indian  and Arab ;  the types of mind are sodifferent, and I think  also that it is partly owing to the propaganda of the Committeeof Union and Progress.  It is the  same in Egypt; and Masri, who was almost a heroin Egypt at one time,  has now to live alone ;&quot;he has had to leave the family to  whichhe belonged, and has had to go into a part of his own, because he  is prohibited.  Allwe have to do with regard to India is not  to mix ourselves up with religious squabbleswhich have to do with the Khalifate. YvTth regard to any Mohammedans who are our
 friends, as the Arabs wish to be, I think, that we should  back our friends.  It is no use not backing our friends because people who have been influenced by our enemies dislike them.  Before I leave that 1 should  like to mention the fact,  I think  the Prime Minister will remember, that when he made his speech, I think at Birmingham, the  French  financiers  mobilised  to  pay for  Enver&apos;s  advance at  Adrianople   that was through the Ottoman Tobacco Regie Company and the Indian  Moslem machinery was set in motion. -          t/      5. THE PRIME MINISTER: The Indian Moslems  began when ? A. An agita- tion began to appear in the papers and the books of  the Indian  Mohammedan press, and there was  a general movement  against our Adrianople policy.  Those  two forces, i.e.,  French  Levantine  finance and Indian  Mohammedanism, mobilised to protect Adrianople.      9. THE PRIME MINISTER : It was  a very unfortunate demarche.   It was made on the best information and with the best intentions.  It was about 1913, was it not ?-A. I  think it was.      10.  MR.  BALFOUR: What did the Prime Minister say ? A.  He warned  the Turks not to go to Adrianople, and  those two forces in Egypt and in India those two machines were set in motion, and  the  French financiers came forward and paid  for Enver&apos;s  advance.  I think the same forces came into  motion when Constantinople was threatened ; there was a certain agitation  in India and in Egypt, and, if I remember rightly,  the French financiers reminded us that they had 30 per cent, of the Bagdad Railway; and  I feel not openly, but underneath that those two forces are mobilised against anything happening in Syria.     Now I should like just to conclude  by putting before you the dangers that I think confront us  if matters are  allowed to slide.   Tf  we adopt a perfectly passive attitude in the face of this, the Sherif, I think, will be killed.     11.  MR.  BALEOUR: Will be what ? A. Will be  killed,  and  a Committee of Union and Progress nominee will be put in his place.   That gives  the Turks and the Germans Mecca.  The Christians in  Syria will be exterminated, as the Armenians have been exterminated.   I  am sure it is a mistake to imagine that hitting Turks urges them to  kill Christians.   It is going away  that produces the  massacres.   They did not touch the Armenians until the Russians were fairly back  in  the Caucasus: and I can give a reason for this.  Massacres are generally carried out by notables and mobs, and if the notables and the  mobs think that there is any prospect of Christian soldiers appearing within three or four months,  while  there is  still  evidence  of their  crime, they7 hesitate to commit it for fear of retaliation.  The  anti-Committee elements will be destroyed among the Arabs, the intellectual Arabs will be hanged and shot, and the- officers that matter will be exterminated too.  The Arab  machine will  be captured and  the ignorant notables and the fanatical people will then alone be left, and they will become subservient to the Committee of Union and Progress, and the Germans will then oblige the Turks to combine  terrorism with concessions to the ideal of Arab nationality.   Already Mr. Koch, of  the  German Consulate at Aleppo, is beginning to talk of Turco-Arabia, and I understand that Baron Oppenheim is  on  the same path. I think that we shall live to see Islam pretty solid; then  we shall be  confronted with the danger of a real  Jehad.   Mesopotamia may become a scene of major operations if we intend to hold on  there,  and a  stream  of people going  uninterruptedly to Persia, to Afghanistan,  and considerable unrest in  India  and the  Soudan; and, remember, that next year, if  the war is in progress, the Indian pilgrims will go to a Committee Sherif, and not to a Sherif who is known to be well disposed to us.  That is, the Indian pilgrims will  be going to  Mecca.  I know that the idea  is strongly held that success in the West means our being  able  to  dictate  in Syria and  jelsewhere. I think  if it was only a military problem  that would be so, but I  think with the existence of this French-Levantine financial influence, that there is always a chance at the last moment, although having great success in the West, of the French financiers preserving a status quo in the Ottoman Empire, and that means  ending the war with grave danger post-war to  India,  Egypt, and  to the Entente, if Russia  is unsatisfied in  regard  to an  open  port.  I do not  want to make any suggestions, except on very general  lines; but I feel we ought to settle with  France as soon;as  possible, and  get  a definite understanding about Syria.   Secondly, to organise&apos; a powerful army in Egypt which is capable  of taking the offensive; and, thirdly, to co-ordinate  our Eastern operations.   Get  that as one machine, and one definite
  problem.: link np Aden, Mesopotamia the whole of that as one definite problem for  the duration of the war.  If we had that I think it is worth  backing the Arabs, no  matter what ground we may have lost to the north of Haifa,   It is worth backing the  Sherif party of the  Arabs in Damascus and in Lebanon and those  who  escape  massacre and also, I think, it is worth considering where we are going  to be on the  defensive and  where on the offensive.  I feel that Egypt should be the base of offensive  operations, because the climate is good, and it is a good place to keep and train troops,  and I think  that as Bagdad has slipped from our grasp, apparently for some time,  that Mesopotamia is a field of operations where we should be on the defensive, or use  as few troops as possible, because an army based on Basra, where all the field hospitals  and sick are, where cent, per cent, get fever sooner or later, is in  a  very difficult  position when  fighting an army which is based on Bagdad, where, although  the  days  are very hot, nearly all nights are cool, and it is not hot for  a long time not more  than six weeks.     12. ME.  BALFOUB,:  What sort of an arrangement would  you like  to  have  with the Erench ?  What would you say to them ? A.   I should  like to retain for  ourselves such country south of Haifa as was not in the Jerusalem enclave, which  I  gather the Erench themselves admit.  I  think it is most important that we should  have a belt of English-controlled country between  the Sherif of  Mecca  and the  Erench.     13. THE  BBIME MINISTER:  You  mean the whole way from  the Egyptian  frontier to Haifa, except the enclave ? A.  I think it could be argued to the Erench  that they were not  giving up very much, assuming the enclave is large enough to  contain the  head of  the Dead Sea  and  enough of the Jordan  for  the  pilgrims  to go to.     14. MR. BALEOTJR:  What do you leave the Erench in Syria ? A. That leaves the  French from the  &quot;e&quot; in Acre up  to as far as they like to go round the Gulf of Alexandretta.     15. LORD KITCHENER : They want to go right round ? A. If they include all that in Syria they might exclude a part elsewhere.  They are only giving  up what lies  between  Acre and the beginning of the Jerusalem enclave, which will be about 20 miles.     16. MR. BALEOUR :  We have  always  regarded this 90 or 100 miles of desert upon her eastern side as a  stronghohd of Egypt; now you  propose still further  east of that to give us a bit of inhabited and cultivated country for which we should be responsible.  At first sight it looks  as if that would weaken and not  strengthen our position in Egypt.     LORD KITCHENER : I think that what Sir Mark  Sykes means is that the line will commence at the sea-coast at Haifa.   These Arabs will then come under our control, whereas if we are off the line we lose control over the south.     17. MR. BALEOUR :  What do you mean to give exactly ?-A.  I should like to draw a line from  the &quot; e &quot; in Acre to the last &quot; k &quot; in Kerkuk.     18. MR. LLOYD GEORGE :  Do you propose that this should be the first step before you take any military action ? A. I think it is essential that  we should, know where we are.     19. Q. Before you begin ? A.  I  think we should begin to prepare for military action.     20. Q. Is it your idea that there should be a great offensive in Egypt, which will sweep up into Syria ? A. Well, Sir, I do not like to dictate.     21. Q. With regard to the proposition you  put before us, that  we should be on the defensive  in Mesopotamia, but  that we should be on the offensive in Egypt, what does  the offensive mean there?  because you  said something about  supporting the Arabs in Damascus and Lebanon.  You could not support them without troops ?-A. You would have to send  out troops.     22. Q. It means a great offensive from Egypt sweeping up through Syria ?      [1337]                               &apos;           ^         &apos;      C
      MR. BALFOUR :  Unless you land in Syria?-A. Yes.      23.  MR.  LLOYD GEORGE :  I take it that you mean Egypt ? A.  I  mean  Egypt would he a storehouse for the troops.      24. Q. You might attack  from Alexandretta ? A. Erom Alexandretta. or across  the Sinai Peninsula, as has been done on several occasions.      25. Q. By a small force ?- A.  Yes.      26. Q. Have you ever  had a  great force ? A. I do not want to confuse the  question by going into great antiquity, but there have been very large armies.      27. LORD  KITCHENER: Ibrahim Pasha&apos;s force, for instance.-A. Yes, Sir.      28. MR. LLOYD GEORGE : You suggest in  your memorandum that we might have 150,000 Turkish troops in Syria ;  if tbe enemy attack Egypt, we should require a very large force on our side, should we not ? A. Again I would rather not discuss the military details, because I do not want to impose my ideas, which are those of an amateur.  But, there are many opportunities; for instance, you have the advantage of Cavalry.     29. MR. LLOYD GEORGE : I suppose you discussed even military questions with those who  were competent to form  an opinion when you  were  out there ?  A. Yes, I did.     30. Q.  It is a military proposition, is it not ? A. They all strongly hold the idea of making a landing at Alexandretta.     31. Q.  You mean the Egyptian soldiers ? A. Yes, they  have always held  that opinion.     LOBL) KITCHENER: They are strongly of that opinion.  If  you cannot come to an arrangement with Erance, may you not be straining your relations  with France very gravely  if  you assume you  have come to  an agreement with.them and  take action in Syria ?  My opinion is that  before it  can become  a military problem we must know what the French actually  demand not what they  demand, but what they insist upon having.  They demand the wdiole of Syria.  Their demands are  very much indeed as Sir Mark Sykes has told  us,  but how much  will they give way on that ?  If they give nothing, all these operations will be taking place and be a source of the gravest anxiety to us.    -MR.. LLOYD  GEORGE : It cannot be a military proposition merely.     LORD KITCHENER: It cannot be a military proposition until the diplomatic proposition is settled.   With regard to Alexandretta, the Erench officers told me it was not with any intention of considering  their interests in Syria that it was rejected, but just as we  in  France do  not claim  Erance because  we have troops  holding positions there, so with regard to Syria.  They are guests in a country and we recognise them as such.    THE PRIME MINISTER: That will not do.    MR. LLOYD GEORGE : We are not quite as simple as that.    32. THE  PRIME MINISTER: We must have  a political deal.   We must come to terms with the Erench, which means  we  must  come to terms diplomatically. A. Quite so.    33. Q. I wonder at the present moment if they are inclined to allow us to get good terms out of them ? A. I think that we  have those two assets.  I  think that we  can play on the French colonial if we work it well:  get it into the French coloniaPs head what a Committee of Union and Progress Sherif means, and point out what they have done in  India and what they might do elsewhere.  I think the French clerical is quite capable of being influenced by reason of the danger  to  his one asset in Syria, and if you rob the occult French financial force of its two  agencies, then, I think, you  are on the high road to a settlement.   Certainly the two people I  have talked to, M. de France in Cairo and Captain St. Quentin, who was a member of the French Military Mission, have both admitted those  two propositions, and have certainly seemed tochange  their ideas.   They began  by taking the view of Senator Erandin.   That is,
that Erance should have practically everything, and they admit that giving up to Acreis giving up very little only that small strip.  It must be remembered that the desertdoes not end with the Egyptian frontier;  the desert comes right up to Hebron.  It isnot taking anything away from them if we sacrifice even Hauran to them.                                    Note.    Sir Mark Sykes desired that the following opinion, which he had omitted from hisevidence, might be added :          &quot; I am of opinion that passive defence of Egypt, with its natural sequels, will    necessitate the eventual despatch to India and Egypt of a larger number of troops    than under the scheme of building up in Egypt now a force capable of offensive    action.&quot;FBIHTKD AT THB JOBBIGV OWIOT BT C.
