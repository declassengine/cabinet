[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government] -   225    Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  December 1915.SECRET. G.-42.                                                    1?COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.      Memorandum  by General Sir Ian  Hamilton                          ONA Letter from Mr. K. A. Murdoch to the Prime Minister of    the Australian Commonwealth (C.I.D. Paper G.-25).2, Whitehall Gardens. S.W.,          November 26, 1915.
MEMORANDUM BY GENERAL SIR IAN HAMILTON  ON COMMITTEE OE    IMPERIAL  DEFENCE PAPER No. G.-25, DATED SEPTEMBER 28, 1915,    COVERING A-&quot; COPY OF A LETTER FROM MR. K.  A.  MURDOCH TO    THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.&quot;    ON the 13th October last I received a communication from Major-General Callwellenclosing a  Committee of Imperial Defence paper  dated the 28th September whichcontained  a copy of a letter from Mr. K. A. Murdoch to the Prime Minister of theAustralian Commonwealth.   Lord Kitchener, so Major-General Callwell informed me,had not yet had time to read Mr. Murdochs letter and as  I felt confident  that justicewould  be done to me and to my troops the moment the Secretary of State found timeto run his eye over the  document my acknowledgment (copy attached)  treated thewhole matter seriously, but not very seriously.    Now, however, having come home, I find that no steps have been taken to reassurethe minds of those who have read Mr. Murdochs letter, and I will therefore deal withit in further detail.    First, as to the cmalifications of this self-constituted critic.  On the 17th August,Mr. Murdoch  wrote me  a wheedling letter (copy attached) asking permission to visitAnzac, a misleading letter inasmuch as he omits to mention&apos;his connection with &quot; TheAge&quot;  newspaper  and claims,  untruly I have since been informed, a connection with theLondon &quot;Times.&quot;  Enclosed were certain instructions from the  Acting Minister ofDefence and  a letter  of  introduction from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth.In neither of these is there any indication that Mr. Murdoch had  been  entrusted withany mission to report on military matters.  As  far as appears from these  papers, thescope  of his enquiries  was  limited to certain  questions  of administrative business.Indeed, from  a brief  conversation I held with him on his arrival,  as well as from hisremarks now under review, it seems clear that he is in no sense qualified to  pose as amilitary correspondent. His visit was of the briefest.  He resisted  the temptation  tovisit Helles,  twelve miles  distant, despite his original &quot; intense anxiety &quot;  to visit thesacred  shores of Gallipoli,  and despite the facts that transport was always available andthat he had  my full permission to go  anywhere and  see anything.    In  short,Mr. Murdoch had hardly a bowing acquaintance with the peninsula, and he  knows it.But this does not deter him from dealing out unrelieved condemnation to everv sectionof the force : men, officers, staff,  generals, lines  of communication, base  and homeadministration-always excepting the Australians.    It will  be observed  that Air. Murdoch in this first letter to  me states that theobject of his visit is to &quot; record censored impressions &quot; and that he carefully reassuresme as to his  discretion by  saying, &quot; any conditions you impose I should of course faith-fully observe.&quot;  In view of subsequent events this &quot; of course &quot; is good  !  The onlyconditions  I  asked  him to  observe   were  those  contained in  the ordinary  warcorrespondents&apos; declaration (copy attached) which he signed.  By this he did &quot; solemnlyundertake&quot; and &quot;bind himself&quot;  &quot; not to attempt to correspond by any other route orby any other means than  that officially sanctioned.&quot;  Further, that,  in the  event of hisceasing to act as correspondent  he would  not during  the continuance   of the  war&quot; impart to anyone military information  of a confidential nature.....unless firstsubmitted to the Chief Field Censor.&quot;   The man  who signed this solemn undertakingendeavoured, within a few  days  of  tbe  signing,  to  smuggle  a  communication  ofMr. Ashmead Bartletfs, which he knew to  be uncensored,  out of the war area.    During Mr. Murdochs brief stay he took up his  quarters in  the press camp,  andthough the writing may  be the writing of Murdoch,  the bias was supplied  to  himthere.    Mr.  Murdoch commences  by ventilating his views  on the whole  Dardanellesquestion, and I am not here concerned to combat them.   He proceeds:        &quot;The first  two efforts, those of the fleet alone and of the combined forces in April-May, failed    miserably mainly because London expected far too  much from floating artillery.  It is only now    being recognised that the naval guns, with their flat trajectory, are of little avail against the
    narrow Turkish trenches.  The last great effort, that of the 6th-12th August, was  a  costly    and bloody fiasco, because, in addition to wretched staff work, the troops sent were inadequate    and of most uneven quality.  That  failure has created a situation which even yet has not been    seriously  faced, i.e.,  a  choice between, withdrawal of  our armies and hanging on for a fresh    offensive after winter.  Unfortunately, I was not in  time for any of those big operations, but I    visited most parts of Anzac and Suvla Bay positions, walked many miles  through the trenches,    conversed with the leaders  and what senior and junior officers I could reach, and was favoured in    all parts with full and  frank confidence.  I could not visit  Helles, where we have about 25,000    men and many animals and cars (armoured cars hidden helpless in trenches &apos;).&quot;     Is it true that the combined operations of April and  May &quot; failed miserably &quot; ?   Ileave it to others to decide.    My point  in quoting these paragraphs  is  to illuminateMr. Murdoch&apos;s methods.  Sweeping generalities and charges no attempt to justifythem.  He does not visit Helles, yet calls the landing a  miserable failure.   The  terms&quot;staff&quot; or &quot; staff-work &quot; are to Mr. Murdoch exactly what a red  rag  is to  a bull.   Hegrasps their  true  significance  about as much as the old woman of pious memory graspedthe blessed word  Mesopotamia.    He is innocent  of the  perennial feud  between  stafiand  regimental  officers, and believes  he  has alighted  on  something peculiar to thepeninsula when he hears everything thrown on to  the backs of people with  red tabs  ontheir collars.   By example after example I could  demonstrate his entire ignorance  ofstaff-work as well as staff, and   yet this  does not prevent  him  from qualifying themalways as &quot; wretched.&quot;        &quot; We have abandoned  our intentions  of taking Acbi  Baba by frontal assault.  This was    always a hopeless scheme after early May, and no one can understand why Hamilton  persisted with    it.  Achi Baba is a gradual bare slope, a mass of trenches and gun emplacements, but so little did    the General Staff know of  its task that it expected to storm it with ease.   Indeed, the General    Staff sent our artillery, horses,  and  ambulance transport  with our landing parties  in April, as if    the Australasian army corps could get astride the peninsula in a few days.  I assure you that if    our landing had been at Gaba Tepe  as proposed, only a few broken remnants of  our magnificent    force would have reached the defensive line.  Having at last abandoned his expensive design    to storm Achi Baba, Hamilton is keeping his divisions at Helles merely to hold a  corresponding    body of Turks.  Helles is, therefore, the  most quiet of  the three  zones, though even there every    yard of ground is commanded by the enemy&apos;s guns, and even the beaches are frequently shelled.&quot;     There was common  ground amongst all the most capable  officers  on  the peninsulain the belief that at any time in May or June, and up perhaps to the middle of July, wecould  storm Achi Baba provided  we  had  men and munitions.   But  where  is theauthority for saying that either I or any member  of  my General Staff ever  expected tostorm that mountain with ease ?        &quot; On this  flat  in  August nearly  90,000 men were landed.   They were  new army and    territorial divisions.  They had spent a fortnight on the water, in transports  which  even the    most careful arrangements could not make wholesome.  I was on the lower deck of one of these,    and the place was putrid.  The men could not be allowed on shore at ports of call.  One or two    regiments were given  route marches, but the long  spell of  ship life was surely in every case    weakening.   Those which were to land  first were given landing  practice at Mudros (advanced    base) and Imbros (headquarters base), but many were set ashore direct from their ships at Suvla.    In addition to the ordinary weakening effects of troopships was the nervous strain of expectation    of submarines.  Most of the men ignored this, but I was on the &apos; Beltana&apos; when a submarine was    sighted and fired at, and I know that this strain did exist.        &quot; You can imagine, then, that these fresh, raw, untried troops, under amateur officers, home-    sick and apprehensive, were under normal in moral when the  day of landing approached.  They    had &quot;to be packed  like sardines  on the trawlers and  small destroyers and vessels lor  the actual    landing, and were kept like this for most  of  an  afternoon  and  the whole of a night.  Before    this embarkation they had  each received three day&apos;s supply of iron rations biscuits and bully    beef and had filled their water bottles-one bottle to each  man.   Then in the early hours came    the landing, when the life of man is at its lowest.&quot;     1... The  figure of men landed at Suvla is false by two-thirds.   The forces  actuallylanded for the operations 6th-10th August numbered  about 30,000 men in all.     2. It is untrue that the  men were on board ship for  a fortnight continuously beforelanding.  Much the greater proportion were assembled  on  shore at  Mudros  until  24hours, and at  Imbros  until  a few &apos;hours  only, before landing.  These latter I myselfinspected during their embarkation at dusk on the 6th August.   They were in splendidform and were  ashore  before  daybreak  on the  following  morning.   The transportaccommodation was excelleut.     3. &quot; One or two regiments were given route marches.&quot;   This is an exact perversionof the truth.  The whole of the troops except one or two regiments  (who  got upset byptomaine poisoning)were given route marches.
      4. As to the troops being &quot; fresh, raw, untried, under amateur officers, homesick  and apprehensive,&quot;  I can only ask if this is accepted  as a just description by those  who sent me these troops ?  I at any rate do not, and consider it an undeserved libel  on what were fine troops and gallant officers.         &quot; I do not say that better arrangements  could have been made.  But I do say that in the     first place to send raw, young recruits on this perilous enterprise was to court disaster &quot; ;      If no better arrangements could have been made, why condemn the staff?     &quot; and  Hamilton would have some reasonableness behind his complaints that his  men let him     down,&quot;      Where has Hamilton made this complaint ?   I repudiate the charge in the strongest terms.     &quot; if he and his staff had not at the same time let the men down with grosser wrong-doings.&quot;      No attempt being made to justify this charge, it must be regarded as mere  abuse. But what are  the words immediately following ?          &quot; The landing was unopposed ; the Turks were taken completely by surprise.&quot;     Mr. Murdoch is incapable of judging the bearing of his own criticisms,  or to whom the credit belongs for organising that surprise which is the first half, and perhaps  the- greater half, of victory.  To assemble a  force (believed by the writer to  consist of 90,000 men) by sea transport  among  islands where every movement -of every ship is under the observation of the enemy&apos;s numerous spies ; to  embark them for  their final stage within easy range of  the  enemy&apos;s air scouts ; to transport them  during several successive days over a sea route, every yard of it visible from the  enemys  permanent observation posts, and so to deceive the Turks that this huge armada disgorges its living freight practically unopposed here indeed is a triumph for the work of the General Staff.         &quot; I am  informed by many officers that one division went  ashore without any orders what-    soever.   Another  division,  to which had been allotted the  essential work of  occupying the     Anafarta Hills, was marched far to the left before the mistake in  direction  was noticed.   It was    then  recalled, and  reformed, and sent off towards the ridge.  As a practical man, how much     water do you think would be left in these thirsty English boys&apos; bottles by  this time after the    night on the seas, and the hot march out,  march back, and  advance ?  Of course, not a drop.    And yet the staff professes surprise that before  noon the men were weak for want of water.  The    whole army suffered intensely from thirst during the next three days.  There were  many deaths    from thirst.  One general even assured me that the collapse on Anafarta Hills was due to thirst.    Certainly these hot-blooded young men, scions of the thirstiest  race in the world, were sent  out    into tropical  heat  with food  calculated  to engender fierce thirst, and  without  water.  The!    divisional commanders have a just grievance against the General Staff when they say that they    were sent out not  only with indefinite orders and without a good knowledge of  the country over    which  they  were to advance, but without water and with little  or  no knowledge of  the  few    muddy wells existing in those parts.&quot;     Two charges are levelled here against the General Staff :-     (a.) One division went  ashore  without  any orders whatsoever.     [b.)  No arrangements were made to provide  water, and the troops had little or            no knowledge of the few muddy wells existing.     Mr. Murdoch here falls into a pardonable, because  common, error in  making theuse he does of tbe term &quot;General Staff.&quot;  This is not the place to give a comprehensivedefinition but,  broadly and  briefly, I  may  remark that the  General Staff at generalheadquarters prepare  (under the  orders of the  commander-in-chief)  the  scheme ofoperations and communicate  to the  corps  commander his  operation  orders.    Suchorders seldom go into detail, but content  themselves with  giving information and withpointing out the  main desiderata and difficulties.  The corps  commander  must thenconvey  and explain the scheme to divisional generals, and must give them more specificorders in further detail.  Once the enterprise  is started, it  is for the  corps commanderto alter or amplify those orders as seems to  be  called for by the course of events.  Thestaff at  general  headquarters (not the &quot;General  Staff&quot;) have to place at the corpscommanders&apos;disposal such troops, ammunition, and supplies as are deemed  necessary,together with all available information essential to the execution of the  strategic  plan.The water (for  instance) having,been placed in bulk at the disposal of the corps, it would       [1273]                ^                                               C
be for the corps to see to its local  distribution.   Here  at the  Suvla Bay  landing, thequestion of water and its  provision  came within the  purview  of the staff at generalheadquarters, but the operation orders given  to the corps fall within the purview  ofthe &quot; General Staff.&quot;     Take the latter question first i.e., the orders.  Once these are issued to  the corpscommander he  becomes responsible for the issue of his further, more detailed  orders  tothe  divisions.   My  orders were  issued to  &apos;the  corps on  the  30th July,  and  thecorps  commander informs me that  he  gave  the divisional  commanders  their  orders.Beyond this I feel I cannot at present go.     With regard to water.  My most  harrassing care  in every one  of my  landingsupon the hostile and unsurveyed shores of the Gallipoli  Peninsula was bound up withthis very question.   I cannot here enter into an account  of the detailed measures takento ensure, as far as humanly was possible, that water was placed au  the disposal  of thecorps commander for the supply of his troops.  My  despatch  will set  forth with somefullness the  measures  taken to  this  end.   But  I  may  say  now. without any  fear  ofsubsequent refutation, that the arrangements made were most, elaborate and, as far asavailable resources permitted, adequate.   Also, that they were  far in advance of thosemade for the original landing, as I had gained meanwhile by  experience.     &quot; There were many deaths from thirst.&quot;  The statement is untrue.   There existsno record of a single death from that cause  alone.  The  truth  is deplorable enough  inall conscience,  viz.,  that  there was  much  suffering and  much  military delay  andinconvenience from lack of water distributed on the  spot.  At  Suvla, as  at Anzac, thetroops suffered the greatest hardship  from thirst, but, as  in the case  of other hardships,they bore this also wdth a constancy  which can never sufficiently be  admired.        &quot; I am, of course, only repeating what I have been told on  all hands, but you will trust me    when  I say that  the work of the General Staff in Gallipoli has been deplorable.  The general    idea, that of  getting astride the peninsula and cutting the line of  communications  connecting    the southern Turkish army with its  bases, was good.  I understand it was Birdwood&apos;s scheme.    The only criticism I have heard against it is that the  great left flank movement from Anzac,    which was directed against Hill 971 and  Chunuk Bair, while the  Suvla Bay operations  were  in    progress, was wasteful, inasmuch as the splendid Australasian troops, Gurkhas, and  Connaught    Bangers, broken to  pieces in this  advance, could  have  been shipped to Suvla, aud  there used    as the main  wedge in the great effort to cross to  Maidos.  I discussed  this criticism with our    Australian staff, and found a decided opinion that the scheme as a whole was sound. The left    flank movement was essential to the success of the Suvla  advance, owing  to the dominating    influence of Hill 971 and Ghunuk Bair &quot; !     Mr. Murdoch begs the Prime  Minister  of the Australian Commonwealth to trusthim when he says &quot; that the work  of the General Staff in Gallipoli has been deplorable.&quot;Corroboration,  naturally,  there is none: indeed, the-remainder  of the  paragraph  isdevoted to showing that the &quot; general idea&quot; was good,  and the &quot; scheme,&quot; on the whole,sound.   But &quot;general ideas&apos;&apos; and  &quot;schemes &quot; are the essential  business of the GeneralStaff!  To bring Mr. Murdochs  evidence and finding into  juxtaposition is like puttingtwo Kilkenny cats into a box.   Annihilation is the inevitable result.        &quot;The IXth Army Corps reached Anafarta Hills, but could not maintain their position.  Of    the terrible manner of their retreat I  need not tell you in this letter.  One of our generals, who    had his men trying desperately to hold on to  the shoulders of  971 and Chunuk Bair (only a    few Gurkhas  really reached  971 and  a few Australians Ghunuk Bair), was staggered to see the    IXth and  Xth Corps retreat, at the  very moment when  their firm holding was essential.  He    was staggered by its manner and  principally by the obvious conflicts  and confusions between    British generals, due, I am told, to the  disinclination of two of them to accept orders from    De Lisle, who, though junior, had been placed in command after  the recall of General Stopford.    At least two generals were recalled at  once-Stopford, who had an army corps, and Hammersley,    who for two years was under lock and key through lapse of memory, but who was thought good    enough by London for this work of supreme importance to the Empire.  I am told that a  second    divisional commander was  recalled.   Diverse  fates were in store for brigade commanders at    least one, Kenna, V.C., was killed in action.&quot;    The general who saw the IXth and Xth corps retreat, might well be  staggered. TheXth  corps did  not exist,  and the &quot; obvious  conflicts and confusions between Britishgenerals, due to the disinclination of  two of them to accept orders from De Lisle,&quot; musthave  been an astounding thing to observe.   De  Lisle was at Helles,  and the refusal ofMahon  to serve  under him  took  place some days later, not on the battlefield, but upon apeaceful scrap of paper.    The letter now ranges widely over subjects calling for no comments from me, exceptthat the figures given are inaccurate  ; the estimates are based on guesses.
      I pick up the thread again further on.         &quot; And now one word about the troops.  rTo one who sees them at work in trenches and on     beaches and in saps can doubt that their moral is very severelj&apos; shaken indeed.  Tt is far worse     at Suvla, although the  men  there are only two months from home, than anywhere else.   The     spirit at Suvla is simply deplorable.  The men have no confidence in the staff, and, &apos;to tell the     truth, they have little confidence in London.  I shall  always remember  the stricken face of a     young English lieutenant when I told him he must make up his mind for a winter campaign.  He     had had a month of physical and mental torture, and the prospect of a winter seemed more than     he could bear.  But  his crreatest dread was  that the London authorities would  not  he^in  until     too late to send winter provisions.  All the  new army is still clothed in tropical uniforms, and     when  I left London was still sending out  drafts in thin &apos; shorts.&apos;  Everywhere one encountered     the same fear, that  the armies would  be left to their fate, ana that the many shipments of     materials, food, and clothing required for winter would not be despatched until the  weather made     their lauding impossible.&quot;      This  picture of  the smug Australian journalist preaching  Jeremiahs  to the young English lieutenant until  he raises up appealingly  a &quot; stricken face&quot; is peculiarly uncon- vincing the young  English lieutenant part of it  anyway.         &quot; This lack of confidence in the  authorities arises principally from the fact that every man     knows that the last  operations were grossly bungled by the General Staff, and that Hamilton     has led a series of armies into a series of culs-de-sac.  You would  hardly believe  the  evidence of     your own  eyes at Suvia.   You would, refuse to believe  that  these men were really British     soldiers.  So badly shaken are they by their defeats and  by  their  surroundings:  so physically     affected are they by the lack of water and the monotony  of a salt beef and rice diet, that they     show an atrophy of mind and body  that is appalling.   I must coniess  that in our own trenches,     where  our men have been kept on  guard  for abnormally long periods, I saw the same terrible     atrophy.  You can understand how  it arises.   It is like  the look of a tortured  dumb animal.     Men living in  trenches with no movement except when they are digging,  and  with  nothing to     look at except a narrow strip of  sky and with the blank walls of  their prisons, cannot remain     cheerful or even thoughtful.   Perhaps some  efforts could have  been made  by the War. Office to     provide them  with cinemas or entertainment, but of course Gallipoli is at the end of a long and     costly, not to say dangerous, line of communication.   This fact  is  the only excuse for the excess     of  bully-beef feeding.-                                      .         &quot; The physique  of those  at  Suvla is not to be compared  with  that of  the  Australians.     Nor is their intelligence.  1 fear also that the British physique is very much below that of the     Turks.  Indeed, it  is  quite obviously so.  Our men have  found it impossible  to form a  high     opinion of the  British K. men and territorials.  They are merely a lot of childlike youths, without     strength to endure  or brains to improve their conditions.&quot;     I let  the usual unsupported jibe against  the &quot;General  Staff&quot; pass.  But I  knowthat Mr. Murdoch will not find  one member of the  Suvla Bay force who will endorsehis cruel travesty of the soldiers who compose it,  when  he describes  them as  &quot; a lot  ofchildlike youths  without strength to endure or  brains to  improve, their  conditions.&quot;Again, I ask, is this  accepted as a fair description  by those who sent mo these troops ?         &quot; I do not like to dictate this sentence, even for your eyes,  but the fact is that  after the first     day at Suvla an order had to be issued to officers to shoot without mercy any soldier  who lagged     behind or loitered in  an advance.&quot;     Quite plainly, this is a shameful lie.   Mr. Murdoch expresses distaste for his  ownvile words.   But I am afraid he will have  to eat them, all  the same.         &quot;Walker is a plain, hard-hitting soldier.  We are lucky in these men.  But for the General     Staff, and, I fear, for Hamilton, officers and men have nothing but contempt.  They express it     fearlessly.  That, however, is not peculiar to Anzac.  Sedition  is  talked round every tin of bully     beef on the peninsula, and it is only loyaity that  holds the  forces together.  Every returning     troopship, every section of the  lines of communications, is full of the same talk.&quot;     I  fear I must put up  with Mr. Murdoch s  vicarious opinion  of myself, but  onbehalf  of the force generally, I must  point out that  it  is ignorance of  camp hie  whichhas  caused Mr. Murdoch to translate the  inevitable &quot;grousing&quot; of troops by that  big-word sedition.   The men talk, of course,  but actually they  are infinitely lenient totheir commanders.      &apos;   &quot; I like General Hamilton, and found him exceedingly kindly ; I admire him as a journalist;     but as a strategist he has completely  failed.  Undoubtedly  the essential and first step to restore     the moral  of the shaken forces is to recall him and his Chief of Staff, a man more cordially detested    in our forces than Enver Pasha. What the army there wants is  a young leader, a man who has no    past, and around whom the officers can rally.   I am hoping strongly  that Smith-Dorrien will not     be sent out, because whether he failed or not in France, he will  be  said to have failed, and the    troops on the peninsula  must not be allowed to harbour the suspicion that second-rate woods    are any longer  considered good enough for them.&quot;
     Throughout Mr. Murdochs letter  he has lost no chance of casting  a stone at the General Staff.   These are the dark shadows which crowd the background of his picture. Here the Chief of the  Staff is specially singled out.   On service a Chief of the Staff, if he is to be worth his salt, must bear the brunt of disciplining the new type of officer, the civilian, and the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate.   Journalistic success depends on sensation;  military  success depends largely on  information  regarding the  enemys movements and secrecy as regards one&apos;s own.   Whoever else may win the favour of the correspondents  the Chief of the  Staff is  not  likely to do so, supposing he is any good at his job.   General Braithwaite was cordially detested by a leading representative of the press, who closely associated himself with Mr. Murdoch during his brief visit.  The results are apparent to the initiated.  For instance, Mr.  Murdoch objects in anticipation to Smith-Dorrien.   What  does he know of  Smith-Dorrien ?   How does he even get hold of his name ?  Someone else is &quot; hoping strongly that Smith-Dorrien will not be sent out.&quot;     The  fact is Mr.  Murdoch  is  not  debating his own experiences, is not voicing his own views, but  is the mouthpiece partly  of a peculiar school of Australian thought, partly of another  correspondent  who thinks  he has been unfairly muzzled by my staff and uses this free lance, chance journalist  to help him to scraare his account.        &apos;: I cannot see any solution which does not begin with the recall  of Hamilton. Perhaps    before this reaches you this recall will have  occurred.   Do  not believe anything you may see about    a large reinforcement and a new offensive before the winter.  That, I fear, is impossible.  If, after    the Sulva Bay disaster, we had another 100,000 men to pour into the peninsula, we might have    got through ;  but as it is we hold positions that are  nothing more than costly embarrassments.    It is not for me to judge  Hamilton, but it is plain that when an army has completely lost faith in    its general, and he has on numerous occasions proved his weaknesses, only one thing can be done.    He has very seldom been at Anzac.  He lives at Imbros.  The Frenchcall him the general who    lives on an island. The story may not be true, but the army believes that  Hamilton left Sulva    on the 21st August remarking:  Everything hangs in  the balance; the Yeomanry  are about to    charge.&apos;  Of course, the army laughs at a general who leaves the battlefield when everything    hangs in the balance.&quot;    Mr. Murdoch first  considers he should not judge me, then proceeds to act up to hisscruples in a manner decidedly peculiar.     1. Be has seldom been at Anzac.    A strange accusation and one incredible to anj^one who has ever served  with me orknows my temperament.  On the average I visited the troops three times a week.  Thecorps commanders,  so my  staff inform  me,  have made mild protests on this subject.   Myvisits may have taken up  too much of  their time, or  may have caused them undueanxiety; certainly  they  were  not  too  rare.    Lone Pine and the  trenches betweenChocolate Hill and the right of De  Lisle&apos;s division have never been inspected by me,because Generals Birdwood and Byng  positively and strongly objected.   Every otherfront  or  support trench in  the peninsula,  British or French, has at one time or anotherbeen visited by me.    2. He lives at  Imbros.    I  will merely  mention  that  Imbros is  within fifty minutes travel of Suvla  Bay,Anzac, and  Helles, the three areas in which my corps  commanders were operating.  Itwas not  only the  nearest but  the  only place which was in direct communication hysubmarine cable, as well,  as wireless with the three battlegrounds  (themselves withoutlateral inter-communication) ; also it was the only place in direct contact  with the  linesof communication and forward base.  The idea that a commander-in-chief should imposehimself and his  staff on  the  narrow terrain available  to either of his three corpscommanders, where he would not only have been a hindrance to the general selected forsuch an infliction, but would have been debarred from conducting operations as a whole,or of using his reserves, is worthy, shall I  say, of Mr. Murdoch.    3. The French call him the General who lives on an Island,    General Gouroud once paid me a delicate compliment.   Now it has gone the roundsas in the game of &quot; Bussian Scandal,&quot; and behold it transformed into an impertinence. One morning, after a  little success to the French arms which I had been privileged to
 witness, General Gouroud said to me; &quot; Coming  here from your island, you remind me of Achilles quitting his tent.  Your arrival is a presage of victory.&quot;     Mr. Murdoch closes with a story which he says &quot; may not be true.&quot;   It happens to be entirely untrue ; but he does not hesitate to repeat it.  As this is purely personal to myself, I will say  no more than that Mr. Murdoch will, I am sure, regret that he has forgotten what is due from one honourable man to another.        &quot; I could make this letter interminable, and I fear that I have only touched very incompletely    on a few phases.  What  I want  to say to you now  very seriously is that the continuous and    ghastly bungling  over the Dardanelles enterprise was to be expected from such a General Staff    as the British Army possesses, so far as I have seen it. The conceit and self-complacency of the    red-feather men  are equalled only  by their incapacity.   Along the line of  communications,    and especially at  Mudros, are countless high officers  and conceited young  cubs  who are plainly    only playing at war. What can you  expect of men who have never  worked seriously, who have    lived for their appearance and for social distinction and self-satisfaction, and who are now called    on to conduct a gigantic war?  Kitchener has a terrible task in getting pure work out of these    men,&quot;whose motives can never be pure, for the)7 are unchangeably selfish.   I want to s&amp;y frankly    that it is my opinion, and that without exception of Australian officers, that appointments to the    General Staff are made from motives of friendship and social influence.   Australians now loathe    and detest any Englishmen  wearing red.  Without  such  a  purification  of motive as  will bring    youth and ability to the top, we cannot win.&quot;     I have endeavoured so  far  to deal with Mr. Murdochs strictures  regarding  thestaff.   Nowhere can I find a single definite or supported charge  that can be taken holdof.   Here  we have  his real.stock-in-trade.   He is not criticising staff work as he  hasseen it, or  even as he has heard of it.  His complaint  is against &quot; such a General Staffas the British Armv possesses,&quot; yet it is a staff that  has on  its rolls such  names asDoughty-Wyllie, V.C. and Walford, V.C., who both gave their lives  voluntarily leadingdesperate  charges  when  regimental leaders  had been   killed  or  wounded;   HoreRuthven, V.C., wounded in  the attack at Suvla Bay; Skeen, Williams, Street I couldcontinue the list men of  long and  tried service   and who  have again  here shown adevotion to duty, and a self-sacrifice that has seldom been surpassed.     Yet  these  are  the  men,  according  to  Mr.  Murdoch,  of  &quot;conceit  and  self-complacency,&quot;  &quot;equalled  only  by  their incapacitymen  &quot;unchangeably  selfish&quot;&quot; chocolate General Staff &quot; &quot; of a gross selfishness and incapacity.&quot;     Not one word  can Mr. Murdoch find to say of the colossal  difficulties  and dangersthat these men met and  largely  overcame, nor  of the  many  gallant deeds they haveperformed.   Could  anything be more cruelly  ungenerous or unjust ?     I will sum up these slanders in the  words applied  by Lord  Derby to another farless  virulent attack: &quot; No gentleman  would have said  it, and  no  gentleman  willbelieve it.&quot;     For convenience of reference I append the  concluding pages  of  Mr. Murdoch&apos;sletter.  To continue  to  deal  with it in detail would be to repeat mvself. and  I hope Ihave  already said  enough to indicate to  an impartial mind that it does not deserve;record amongst serious papers of State.        t: I could tell you of many scandals, but the instance that will  best appeal to you is that of    the staff ship &apos; Aragon.&apos;  She is a magnificent and luxurious South-American liner, anchored in    Mudros Harbour  as a base for the staff of the Inspector-General of Communications.   I can give    you no  idea  of how the Australians and  the new British officers, too-loathe the  &apos; Aragon.&apos;    Heaven knows what she is  costing,  but certainly the staff lives in luxury.  And nothing can    exceed  the rudeness of these chocolate General Staff  soldiers to those returning from  the front.    The ship&apos;s adjutant is  the  worst  instance of rude and disgusting snobbishness  and incapacity I    have come across.   With others, plain downright incapacity is tire main characteristic.  I must    say this of them also, that whereas of our 3rd Australian General Hospital on shore we had 134    fever cases including typhus, with only a few mosquito nets and no ice and few medical comforts,    the &apos; Aragon&apos; staff was wallowing in ice.  Colonel Stawell you  know  him  as Melbourne&apos;s    leading consultant and Sir Alex. M&apos;Cormick  are not sentimentalists, but they  really wept over    the terrible hardships of the wounded, due to the incapacity of the &apos; Aragon.&apos;  One concrete case    is that  of 150 wounded  men landed in dead of night, with  no provision and no instruments, at    the hospital beach  to make their way as best they could to the hospital, which had no notice of    their arrival.   Eiaschi, de Crespigny,  Stawell, and Kent Hughes will be able to fell you of the    absolutely shocking difficulties of this hospital in face of perpetual snubbing and bungling of the    &apos; Aragon&apos; staff. While I was at the hospital a beautiful  General and his staff  rode in to make    an inspection.  Despite their appearance  as perfect specimens  of the  General  Staff, I thought,    &apos; We shall  now get the ice from the &quot; Aragon &quot; on  to the brows of our unfortunate men.&apos;  But    no ice appeared next day.  The navy is very good, and sent some comforts and ice across, but    for the last three  days before my visit this ice had gone astray before it reached the hospital.        &quot; I told you in  my last  letter of the necessity for canteen ships, and need  not go  into that    now, but on the point of the General  Staff I must say that the work at the bases in Egypt struck       [1273]                                                                 D
    me as on a par with that of the &apos; Aragon.&apos;  Some day you wilt have to take  up the case of Sir    John Maxwell.  He has a poor brain for  his big position, and I assure you that our officers at    Anzac have a poor opinion of the  work of his lieutenant, General Spens-a man broken on the    Continent,  and therefore thought  good enough  to supervise the&apos;training  of Australians-who is    controlling our bases.  The question you will have to fight out about Maxwell is this : After the    last disturbance in the Whasa, where a very few of our men burnt some houses in which  they had    been drugged and diseased, he issued one of his famous lecturing orders, in which he referred to    his regret that &apos; even  wilful murder&apos; had been mentioned as one of the Australian crimes in    Cairo.   In this casual  way did  he blast the good  name of our clean and  vigorous army.  I    enquired as far  as  was possible, and could hear nothing of  even  a charge: of wilful murder    mentioned against any Australian.   This order roused intense anger amongst our men.  Perhaps    we are too sensitive-our men were certainly too sensitive in their anger in the trenches  when a    notice was posted. I think  in orders, describing how an unfortunate British Tommy had been shot    at Helles at dawn for cowardice.   It was almost amusing to hear them  resent this even remote    connection with  the Australian Forces and a veiled threat of such shooting.  &apos;Such things have    nothing to do with.us,&apos; they said.         &apos;; Our men feel that their reputation is too  sacred to leavein the hands of Maxwell, and they    much resent the sudden change  in  the  attitude of  the General Staff, which regarded them as    criminals in Cairo, and now lavishly calls them heroes in Gallipoli.         &quot;You will think, that all this  is a sorry  picture, but do  not forget that the enemy has his    troubles, and that we have certain signs that his moral is deteriorating.  From what I saw of the    Turk I am convinced that  he is a brave  and generous foe,  and he  is fighting now for dear home,    with a feeling that he is winning, and that he is a better man than those opposed to him.   The    Turks, by the way, are as  generous in their praise of our men as the British  and French are.    Certainly  the Turks are positively afraid of our men, and one of their  trenches that opposite    Quinn&apos;s Post is such a place of  fear, owing to the indomitable way in which our snipers and    bomb-throwers have got their men down,  that Turks will  not  go  into it unless they are made    corporals.  So say our Intelligence officers.  I saw many strange and remarkable instances of the    humanity and courage of the Turks.  Certainly his trenches are better than anything we can do,    and he makes them remarkably quickly.         &quot; One word more to-day.   Do, for Heaven&apos;s  sake, make  every effort to secure the recall of    Sir James Porter, the Englishman in charge of the  medical  services.  Our doctors are,  without    exception, furious with him.   He made a shocking muddle of the first arrangements  for transport    of wounded, as I wrote you.  The case  against him  there  was unanswerable.   But  he has been    left in charge, and his muddling continues.  He  lives on a luxurious yacht in Mudros.   Oh ! no    Australian has the heart to tell of the fearful wreckage of lives due to this man&apos;s incompetency.    That is not a wild statement;  it  is  truth.  Even now, the great bulk of the wounded are sent    to Imbros before being passed on  to hospitals elsewhere.  This handling aggravates sickness and    wounds, yet the  generals wonder  why men  sent away from the peninsula with slight  sickness    become worse and  do  not, as expected, return  in  a few weeks do not return  at all.  Our    Australian doctors have bearded Porter in his  den, and talked open defiance to him, in  the vain    hope that he would insist on an enquiry, or lay a charge against them.  We must make the best    of the B.A.M.C., but we surely need not be burdened longer with  Porters sins.  After having    heard and seen  something of  the awful bungling of the wounded transport  arrangements, one    wonders how it is possible that the War Office should regard  with complacency the prospect of    leaving this man the very difficult work of getting sick and wounded  from the peninsula during    the  winter. The only reason I can think of is that professional soldiers stick to each other    through thick and thin.         &quot; I hope I have not made the picture too gloomy.  I have great faith still in the  Englishman;    and, as I said, the enemy is having his own  troubles, too.  But this unfortunate expedition has    never been given a chance.  It required large  bodies of seasoned troops.  It required  a great    lealer. - It required self-sacrifice on the part of  the staff, as well as that sacrifice so wonderfully    and liberally made on the part of the soldiers.   It has had none of these things.  Its troops have    been second class, because  untried before their  awful  battles and privations of the peninsula.    And behind it all is a gross selfishness and complacency on the part of the staff.         &quot; Much more I could tell  you, but my task is done, though I shall write again next  mail I    hope with better news.   This, of course, is a  private letter, but you will show it to George Pearce    and Hughes, so I shall say  nothing more than the  plain good-bye of a friend.                                                          &quot;Sincerely yours&quot;     These concluding paragraphs carry their own  criticism on  their  faces.     The &quot; Aragon.&quot; I have never, either in official writing or speech, made any secretof my dislike  of the &quot; Aragon,&quot; not because  the administrative  staff  wallowed  in  ice(journalese for the refrigerating room), but because intercommunication with  the shore-was inconvenienced.   Unfortunately the precise com fury view was  held by the navalauthorities.    They, for  their part, found  it quiuj  impossible  to  deal  with  thetransportation question from the shore.   The ice eaters  of the &quot; Aragon &quot; were partnaval, part military.  To separate them was out of the question.     &quot; Sir John Maxivell  and  General  Spens.&quot; Sir  John  MaxwelFs brain  will  enablehim to survive this attack upon it, provided always he is given the chance of defendinghimself. . But it is ominous  that  several  high placed and  powerful statesmen have
enquired of me lately quite casually &quot;what sort of a man is  General Maxwell&quot;?I feel then as if I had got my cue, and.that the reply expected by those who have readMr. Murdoch was, &quot;he has a poor brain for his big position.&quot;    &quot; Sir James Porter.&quot; The &quot; Englishman in charge of the medical services.&quot;  Nowhad Sir^James Porter only been an Australian !   On purely personal grounds I resistedthis appointment, cable after  cable (all filed in the War Office), up to the verge ofsubordination.  In my final wire I stated that if  this fifth wheel was  added to themedical coach the battles of the peninsula would be renewed over the bodies of thewounded.   I may be taken as an unprejudiced witness then if I say that Mr. Murdoch&apos;spersonal attack upon Sir James Porter is as ill-founded as the rest of his letter.    I have now done with Mr, Murdoch.   Since I have returned I find everywhere myown  soldierly  reputation has  been  undermined, and  I  catch everywhere echoes ofphrases printed in the Committee of Imperial Defence memorandum.    In my absence,  I, a British General and  a  member of the Committee of ImperialDefence, have had  circulated  amongst my  brother members  aspersions against  myhonour, and libels against my  troops.  No chance  was vouchsafed me of proving themalignancy of these attacks, or of showing how far they might be  inspired by personalanimus.  A fortnight before I had ever heard of their existence they had already beenelevated to the rank of State papers, and passed round  from hand  to hand, and mouthto ear through the most influential circles in the land.    Things being so, I must respectfully request that these remarks of mine may alsobe printed and may be shown (as far as possible) to all  who have  read the vilificationof British Generals, staff,  and regiments penned to his Prime  Minister by Mr. K. A.Murdoch.                                                   IAN HAMILTON, General.    November 26, 1915.
                                    General. Headquarters, MediterraneanDear Callwell,                              Expeditionary Force, October 14, 1915.     I have read Mr. Murdochs letter with care, and I have tried to give it my mostimpartial consideration and not to allow myself in  reply to be influenced in any way bythe criticisms he may have felt himself bound to make upon myself personally.     What does this letter amount to ?  Here we have a man, a journalist by profession,one who is quick to seize every point, and to coin  epithets, which throws  each fleetingimpression into strongest  relief.   He  comes armed  with  a natural  and  justifiableenthusiastic admiration for everything connected with  the Commonwealth to which hebelongs, and ready to retail to his Minister or his public anything that can  contributeto show the troops they have sent in an heroic light.     Here he obtains his  first sight of war and of the horrors and hardships inseparablefrom  it.  He finds men who  have just  been through  some  of the hardest  fightingimaginable and who have suffered terrible losses ;  he  finds probably that very  manyof these whom  he hoped  to  see, certainly many of those of  whose welfare theirmotherland would wish to hear, are killed, wounded, or laid up with illness he findsall this and he becomes vary  deeply depressed.   In such  an atmosphere Mr. Murdochcomposes his letter, a general analysis of which shows it to be divided, to my mind, intotwo separate strata.     First an appreciation  in burning  terms of the spirit, the  achievements, and allsoldierly qualities of the Australian forces.   Secondly,  a condemnation, as sweepingand  as unrelieved as his  praise in the first instance is unstinted, of the whole  of  therest of the force.     I myself as  Commander-in-Chief, my generals, my staff, lines  of  communication,Sir John Maxwell, and General Spens at the Base, even the  British  soldier collectivelyand  individually, are all embraced in  this  condemnation which is  completed by  theinclusion of the entire direction of the forces at home, both naval and military.    Where all are thus tarred with the  same brush, I am content to leave  it to theimpartial reader to decide what reliance can be placed on Mr.  Murdochs judgment.  Myown feeling certainly is that, in his admiration for the Australian forces, and in his grief attheir  heavy losses (in both of which feelings  I fully share), he  has  allowed himself tobelittle and to criticise us all so that  their virtues  might be  thrown into even bolderrelief.     With Mr. Murdochs detailed  points  I do not propose to deal, nor  do I think youexpect me to do so.  On every  page inaccuracies of fact abound.  The breaking ofSpens on the Continent,  a theatre of war  he has  never visited; the overstatement ofour  casualties by more  than 40 per cent.  ; the  acceptance as genuine of a whollymythical order about the shooting of  laggards really the tusk would be too long.  Asto the value of Mr. Murdochs appreciation of the  strategical and tactical elements ofthe situation you  can yourself assess them at  their  true value.     Finally,  I do not for one moment believe&apos; the general statement  put forward to theeffect that the troops are disheartened.  Neither the statement  nor  the assertion thatthey  are discontented with the  British officers commanding them has the slightestfoundation in fact.                                    Believe me,                                            My dear Callwell,                                                     Yours very sincerely,                                                   (Signed)  IAN HAMILTON.    P.S. I  attach correspondence showing  how Mr. Murdoch&apos;s visit arose.  1 believeI exceeded my power in giving him permission to come, but I was most anxious to obligethe Australian  Prime Minister and  Senator Pearce.  You will see that he promisesfaithfully to observe any conditions I may impose.  The only condition I imposed wasthat he should sign a declaration  identical with  that which 1 attach.   He signed, andthe paper is in my possession.
 General Sir Ian Hamilton, G.C.B., D.S.O.,     Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Mediterranean         Expeditionary Forces.                                                              August 17,  1915. Dear Sir,     On the advice of Brigadier-General Legge I beg to request permission  to  visit Anzac.     I am proceeding from Melbourne to London to take up the position  of managing editor of the Australian news cable service  in connection with  the  London &quot;Times,&quot; and at the Commonwealth Governments request am enquiring into mail arrangements, disposition of wounded, and various matters in Egypt in connection with our Australian forces.   I find it impossible to make a complete report upon changes that have  been suggested here until I have a better knowledge  of the system pursued at  Base Y,  and on the Mainland, and I beg of you therefore to permit me to visit these places.     I should  like to go  across in only a semi-official capacity, so that I might record censored impressions in the  London  and   Australian newspapers I represent, but any conditions you impose I should of course faithfully observe.     I beg to  enclose  (a)  copy of general  letter from the Prime Minister of Australia and (6) copy  of my instructions  from  the Government.  I have a  personal letter of introduction to you from Senator Pearce, Minister of Defence.    May I add that I had the honour of meeting /you  at the Melbourne Town Hall, and wrote fully of your visit in the Sydney  &quot;Sun&quot; and  Melbourne &quot;Punch&quot;; may I also say that my anxiety as an Australian to visit the sacred shores  of Gallipoli while our army is there is intense.    Senator Millen asked me to convey his  most kindly  remembrances to  you if I hadthe luck to see you and in case I have not I take this opportunity of doing so!    As  I have only four weeks in which to  complete my work here and get to Londona &quot; collect reply by cable to c/o Colonel Sellheim, Australian Intermediate Base, Cairo,would greatly oblige.                            I have the honour to be, Sir,                                             Yours obediently,                                       (Signed)       KEITH A.  MURDOCH.    c/o  Colonel Sellheim, C.B.,        A. I.  F. Intermediate Base, Cairo.,                                 .

This  letter will  serve  to  introduce Mr.  Keith Arthur Murdoch,  a well-knownjournalist of Melbourne, who is  proceeding to Europe to undertake important duties inconnection with his profession.     Mr.  Murdoch is  also undertaking certain enquiries for the Government  of theCommonwealth in the Mediterranean theatre of war.  And for any facilities which maybe rendered him to enable him the better to carry out these duties, I shall be personallyobliged.                                       (Signed)       ANDREW FISHER,                                                                Prime Minister.
