Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  March 1915.SECRET.G-IQ.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE  WAR.After the Dardanelles.  The next Steps.Notes by the Secretary.2, Whiteliall Gardens, S.W.,             March I, 1915,
AFTER  THE  DARDANELLES.  THE  NEXT STEPS.       NOTES  BY THE SECRETARY TO  THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.    A CERTAIN amount of reluctance must be felt in setting out to discuss a future,contingent on military operations, the outcome of which cannot be forecasted with anycertainty.  The  action to be taken after the conclusion of the present  operationsagainst the Dardanelles ought, no doubt, to be considered under  two heads accordingas they result in success or failure.   Thepresentnot.es deal only witli the contingencyof success.  A further note will be prepared, if and when the War Council desire, toexamine  the situation in the  event of failure, and what alternatives are open  toretrieve it.    2. After writing the  minutes of the last three  meetings of the War Council twomain  impressions  are  left on  the  mind first, that  a successful  passage of  theDardanelles would open the way to  military results which  cannot be overestimated,and second, that these results can only be achieved if the right steps are thought  outat once and acted on the moment that success is certain.   This is the justification forthese notes, in which an attempt is made to  indicate what these steps should be,  thevarious suggestions made  at the &quot;War Council,  being as far as possible taken as a guide.    3. It will conduce at every stage to a correct decision  if it is laid  down clearlywhat is the ultimate goal which we seek to attain by the Dardanelles operation.   Ifthis is kept constantly in  view time will not be lost nor energy wasted  in the inevitableintermediate  stages.   The scheme of these notes,  then, will  be first, to state  theultimate  object which the War Council have  in view, and then to examine the stepsrequired  to  give effect to it in the second stage which follows the opening  of  theDardanelles.                              The Ultimate Object.    4. At  the fourteenth meeting of  the War Council, held last Friday, the PrimeMinister  stated  that the immediate object of  the  Dardanelles operation  was to openthe sea road to the Black Sea, but that the ultimate  object was to bring in the B-dkaiiStates.   Nearly  every member of the War Council mentioned  that as  our ultimateaim.  Some members went further,  and suggested that  we might find  scope in  theNear  East for the employment of the  new armies.   As  Mr. Lloyd  George hasrepeatedly pointed out, the employment of  British  military forces in the Balkans isprobably indispensable if we are to secure the adherence  of the Balkan  States to thecause of  the Allies.  Probably, therefore,  the  War Council wid accept the view thatthe ultimate object of the operations now commenced is  to open the way for militaryoperations against Austria, in  which a British army will, it is  hoped, co-operate withthe armies of Roumania,  Servia,,and perhaps  Greece.    5. If this view is accepted, the  question  arises for  consideration  whether themoment  success is assured an emissary (as proposed  by Mr. Lloyd George) should notbe despatched  to the Balkan States to offer a great scheme of co-operation.   It wouldbe difficult to  convey the ideas of the War  Council  by  telegraph to our  diplomaticrepresentatives, who would not have  the complete  knowledge possessed  by (say) amember  of the Wrar Council.  And, as pointed out by Mr. Balfour, a special emissarywould be able  to visit all  the States concerned, and would return to discuss  the matterwith the  VVar  Council.    6. Such an emissary would be in a far stronger position if armed with  somethingmore than promises for a more or less distant  future, and the prestige  attaching  to theforcing  of the Dardanelles.   For example,  the despatch of a naval flotilla to theDanube immediately after the  opening of the  Dardanelles might be of great assistance       [352]
to him, as it would not only be of great material help in the defence of Servia, butwould be an earnest of our intention to  intervene  effectively.   It is  understood,however, that the  shallow  depth in the Iron Gates canal will prevent effective navalco-operation until the newr gunboats are ready.  It is not known whether the militarysituation would enable existing  light craft to be lightened and brought  through theIron Gates, but it is a question wdiich deserves immediate study.    7. Although the appearance  even of a  small flotilla capable of dealing with theAustrian monitors  would greatly help our emissary, he would not be in a bad j)ositionif he was only in a position to announce the possibility of a substantial military forcebeing sent within some stipulated time.  The amount of such military force  and thetime within which  it can make  its appearance is a question  which Lord Kitcheneralone can decide.   The  emissary should  explain  the advantages  of  an  offensivealliance.  A British force, supported by a powerful flotilla, would form the centre ofthe Allied army.  On the left the Serbians and Greeks would penetrate into Bosniaand Herzegovina.   On the right  the Roumanians would form a connecting link withthe Russian armies in the Carpathians.  The British forces would turn  the  flank ofthe enerny&apos;s forces  opposing the Roumanians, which would enable the Roumanians tothreaten the communications of the enemy&apos;s  forces  operating in the Carpathians.   Allthe time the Franco- British armies  would be exerting continual pressure in the west,and the Russians, even if driven back to the line of the Bug, should be able to containconsiderable armies of observation.    8. It is suggested  that the Admiralty might consider the possibility of findingsome vessels which could be lightened  sufficiently  to  pass through the  Iron Gatescanal without waiting for the new gunboats, and  should consult with our Allies  onthe subject.   It is  also suggested that the War Council might consider the selectionof  a suitable emissary,  to  be despatched  the  moment success  is achieved in  theDardanelles, if that fortunate moment should arrive.    9. Having  indicated the  ultimate aim of the operations  in  the  Near East,and  some of  the  stems which  might  be  prepared  for on the wider issue,  thesituation likely  to  arise  immediately after  the  forcing of the Dardanelles will  beexamined.  Ttie plan followed will be to discuss certain hypothetical situations.   Inthe event they may never arise,  but they form a convenient form in which to bringout certain factors in the  problem, which in any case must be considered. I^irst,however, it will be pertinent to state  certain  physical and  military considerationshearing on the problem.                        The Sea Defences of Constantinople.    10. The following distances are important:           The length of the Dardanelles : about 35 sea miles.          The length nf the Sea of Marmora : about 115  miles.          The length of the Bosphorus : about 17 miles.The  Dardanelles are  4,000 yards wide at  the entrance.  At the Narrows, which arenow  being attacked, the width is  1,400 yards; at the Nagara bend, opposite NagaraPoint, and 4 miles  above the Narrows, the  width is 2,200  yards,  and above  this theStraits have an average width of 3^- miles.  The depths are very great.    11. The main  defences of the Dardanelles, as is well known to the War  Council,are at the Narrows, and  extend from there to Nagara Point.   An important point, towhich allusion will be made later, is that the defences and military forces on both theEuropean and Asiatic sides of the Straits are normally supplied by sea from Constanti-nople. There is only one metalled road leading from the  Gallipoli  Peninsula to themainland, and that road approaches close to the sea,  and  can probably be rendereduseless by ships&apos;  fire.   From  the Asiatic  side there is  no  metalled road  towardsConstantinople.     12. These  points are  of considerable importance, because if the sea route fromConstantinople  to the Dardanelles is interrupted  by the passage of our fleet, and if aship is sent into the Gulf of Xeros to  command the high  road to the mainland,  theforces defending the Straits are practically isolated.  The problem of reducing them.
thus resolves itself into the destruction of their supplies.  The hulk of these might hefound  at  one of the  towns  on  the Straits.  There  should be little  difficulty indiscovering  from the inhabitants, who are  mainly Greeks, where their supplies are,and, in the event of resistance, they might be attacked by incendiary bombs droppedfrom seaplanes.     13. A further point worth noting is  that, for  telegraphic communication withConstantinople, the Dardanelles defences depend on a cable landed on the Asiatic sidefrom JSagara Point and  overhead  land wires across the Bulair neck.  Once the fleetis through, it will be easy either to cut the  communications  or to utilise them  forsending false messages.     14. The garrison of the Dardanelles is  stated bv  the  Greek General Staff toconsist of one division (10,000 men)  on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and one division onthe  Asiatic  side.  These figures are  obviously exclusive of the large artillery  forcerequired to man  the  forts.  These  figures are low,  compared with the estimateshitherto given to the &quot;War Council, and 10,000 men is a small field force  to defend apeninsula 52  miles  long with  numerous  landing places.   The  Greeks, however,ought  to  be  well informed, as the  greater  part of the  civilian  population on bothsides of the Dardanelles  is Greek.  When the writer was Intelligence Officer to theMediterranean Pleet he found that Greek information on Turkish garrisons, &amp;c, wasusually reliable.   The garrison might, of  course, have been  reinforced,  but  againstthis  is  the consideration  already  alluded  to,  that if the fleet forces a  passage, thegarrison of the Dardanelles is practically isolated.     15. Unless it is considered an unwarranted interference with the men on the spot,it might be worth while  to warn the  Admiral, as soon  as  he&apos; anticipates  success, tosend a ship to the head of the Gulf of Xeros, in order to prevent the escape of troopsfrom Gallipoli,  or their reinforcement  from the  mainland,  by  the  Kavak  road.lie  might also be warned to seize the end of the cable and telegraph as soon aspracticable.     16. The Bosphorus,  as  already stated, is 17 miles long.   At the narrowest pointit is  only 700 yards wide,  but the average breadth is \\ miles.  The depths are very great.It is important to note that the defences are all situated in the 7 miles nearest to theBlack  Sea,  and most of the works face  only towards  the east.   There  have  beenrumours of the hasty mounting of guns at the Princes Islands, and at other places nearConstantinople, but there are not likely to be any very formidable defences at the eastend  of the Bcsphorus.                         The Main Objective of  the Fleet.     17. The naval Commander-in-Chief, if he succeeds in forcing the Dardanelles, willhave one primary and immediate object to  seek out and destroy the Turco-GermanPleet, and more particularly the &quot;Goeben.&quot;     18. It  would be  presumptuous  to  attempt  to  suggest how this would beaccomplished.  It will depend a good deal  on the action of the  enemy,  who mayescape into  the  Bosphorus,  or endeavour  to elude  our fleet in the Sea of Marmorain a desperate attempt to escape to the Mediterranean.   It may be supposed, however,that the Admiral will leave  some units of his considerable fleet, including perhapssome  submarines,  to prevent  this  latter  eventuality,  and to ensure  that hiscommunications are kept open.     19. It is suggested that the Russians (if  this has not been done) might be askedto send their Black Sea Fleet to the neighbourhood of the Bosphorus to prevent  egresson that side.                              Subsidiary Objectives.     20. Before discussing the possible terms to be offered to Turkey, if the Dardanellesdefences are successfully reduced, it will be useful to indicate a number of militaryoperations which, though secondary in importance to the destruction of the Turco-German Fleet, are nevertheless of vital importance to the ultimate goal  discussed inthe  early  paragraphs of these notes.   Some of these operations will probably requiremilitary co-operation.
     21. T/ie clearance of the Gallipoli Peninsula and of the Defences  on the  Asiaticside of the Dardanelles comes first of these.  It is desirable,  as  soon  as possible, toeffect this, in order, whatever may be the result of the negotiations at Constantinople,to have a  safe and uninterrupted line of water communication to Constantinople.     22. If,  as anticipated, the Admiral leaves his older ships to guard the  Straits,while he goes in pursuit of the &quot; Goeben,&quot; the Senior Naval Officer at the Dardanellesmight be instructed to demand the surrender of the garrisons.  Failing compliance,he should be  instructed to  institute a blockade and to endeavour  to ascertain thewhereabouts of the supplies and to destroy them, if  possible, by bombardment or byincendiary bombs dropped from aircraft.  It is a matter  for consideration whether itwould be worth while to attack with  military forces at this stage, though this mightbecome necessary.     23. Turkey&apos;$ Arsenals are all situated on  the  shores  of the Sea of Marmoraand, as soon as forces can  be spared, they should either be  destroyed, or (a muchbetter course  if practicable) they should be occupied and  held by a  military force.These manufacturing establishments consist of:      The Naval Dockyard, situated in the Golden Horn, which turns out all kinds of        warlike stores ;     The Tophane Arsenal, situated at the south-western end of the Bosphorus on the        water&apos;s edge.  It turns out  various munitions of war  ;     The Zeitun Burnu cartridge factory and steelworks and the Zeitunlik  powder        factory, both the latter being situated on the Sea of  Marmora, close to deep        water, and not far from San Stephano.All the above  are entirely  at  the  mercy of  a fleet having command of the Sea ofMarmora,  and  steps should  be taken at the earliest possible  opportunity to  depriveTurkey of their use, and, if  possible, to place their  resources at the disposal of theAllies.  It should be particularly noted that, apart  from the above, Turkey  has noestablishments for the manufacture of arms or ammunition.   Their output it under-stood to be rather small,  as Turkey has drawn her  main  supplies of ammunition forsome years  from Krupp&apos;s, but  under efficient management perhaps the productioncould be increased.     21. The isolation of Constantinople is another object that should  be effected atthe earliest possible moment.     25. On  the European side communication with  the rest of Turkey is supplied byone railway, which runs for several miles along  the  coast.   At Kuchuk  Chekmeje,some 5  miles along the coast to the west of  Constantinople,&apos; this railway is crossed.within a few hundred yards of the beach, on flat  land, by the only good metalled roadleading from Constantinople.   At this point both  railway  and road communicationcan be interrupted from the sea, and  Constantinople partially isolated.  The telegraphlines to the interior also run along the coast.  These could be cut,  and the Prussians mighthe asked to  cut the German cable to  Iloumania, thus cutting off Turkey from Europe.     26. It might be worth while  to  warn the  Admiral to effect this interruption assoon as he felt able to do so, in order to secure as much rolling-stock as possible, andto prevent the escape of Germans, Turkish notables, &amp;c, before the reckoning.     27. ^Communication  with Haidar Pasha, the terminus  of the railway  on theAsiatic side, will, of course, be interrupted the moment a fleet appears off the  GoldenHorn.                               .    &apos;     28. It might, however, be worth  while to  warn the Admiral to  interrupt therailway, wdiich runs  for  many  miles along the shores of  the Sea of Marmora, bydestroying a length of permanent way, in order  to prevent the removal of rollings-stock and  the escape  of persons of the type  alluded to above in  paragraph 26.                                  Negotiations.     29. Having forced the Dardanelles, destroyed  the Turco-German  Fleet, isolatedthe garrisons at the  Dardanelles or  secured their surrender,  seized or destroyed the       [352]                                             &apos;              0
Turkish arsenals  and isolated Constantinople, the Admiral would be in a fine positionto commence negotiations.    30. It is suggested for consideration  that  a first-rate  diplomatist, versed inTurkish methods, should be sent out  to  assist him,  unless Mr. Eitzmauriee  isconsidered to have sufficient  weight.   If  this suggestion is adopted, he might be sentto Salonica or Athens at once to await events.    31. It is also for consideration whether the Admiral should not be instructed torefuse  to  enter into any negotiations with  the Germans  in  Constantinople, thoughthere are arguments  both ways.    32. It may well happen that the  course of events might by this time have led toa coup  cVEtat in Constantinople.   Whether this is so or not, whether the negotiationsare conducted with a Government under  German domination or with a more friendlyadministration, terms may have to be offered,  and there seems to  be no particularreason why in the one case they should differ from the other in material points.    33. The writer  is not  specially qualified to express views on what these termsshould be.  The  question, however, has  already been discussed briefly at the WarCouncil;  it  concerns naval and military  as  well as political interests,  and  maytherefore  be considered within the  purview of the Committee of Imperial Defence.In any case  it is  imperative that the Turks should  not  be allowed to procrastinate,and that we should not lose  time in  making up our mind.   The following tentativesuggestions are therefore put forward as a basis for discussion.    34. The principles on which  we  should base our conditions  might, perhaps, besummed up as follows :     (1.) No attempt must be made at this stage for the final solution of the difficult           Turkish  problem.  An interim arrangement of a non-committal character           must be  made.   This was made clear at  the  last meeting  of the  War           Council.    (2.) An  absolutely safe line of communications  must be obtained  between the           Mediterranean and  Black  Sea for the remainder of the  war.    (3.) Turkey must at once be freed from German influence.    35. Conformably to the above  principles it is suggested that Turkey should beoffered a truce on some such terms as the following :     (a) The final settlement to be left in abeyance for the present.    (b.) The Turkish fleet and all naval material to be surrendered to the Allies.&quot;:;:&apos;    (c.) The defences and material of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus to be surrendered           to the Allies.^   All Turkish  troops to be withdrawn from the Dardanelles           and Bosphorus.    (d.) The Turkish expeditions in the Caucasus and against Egypt and Mesopotamia            to be at once recalled.    (e.) The demobilisation of the Turkish army.    (/.) The hire for the period of the war, or sale to the Allies, of Turkish rifles and           other weapons.    (g.). The  Turkish naval dockyard,  arsenal,  powder factory,  shell factory,  and           clothing factory to he placed under officers  appointed by the Allies and           worked in their interest.    (7i.) The persons of all German and Austrian born officers in the army and navy,           and  of all  German and  Austrian born officials  in any  branch  of the           Turkish administration (whether such persons are Turkish subjects or not)           to be handed over  to the Allies as prisoners of war.   Lists of all other           persons of German and  Austrian origin in Turkey to be compiled and           handed over to the Allies, such  persons to be dealt with as decided by the           Allies.    * If this is rejected, purchase  might be offered, or it might be merely requisitioned or borrowed for thetenure of the war to &quot; save the face &quot; of the Turkish negotiators.
    (i.) All German and Austrian concessions in Turkey to remain in abeyance for           the duration of the  war.   tSucli concessions  to be  worked under the           supervision of the Allies in the interest of Turkey.    (j.) German officials to be replaced by nominees of the Allies (e.g.,  by Belgians).    (ft.) Free passage up the Dardanelles by the ships of the Allies.    (I.) The Ailies to have the right to place a garrison in Constantinople during the           Avar.There Avould  probably be necessary provisions  for financial control and for makinggood damage to British, French,  and Russian railways and other commercial concernsin Turkey.   The writer, however, is not qualified to go into these questions.    36. It is suggested that the British Government should  decide Avhat  terms itdesires, and should communicate them,  as  soon as there is a reasonable prospect ofsuccess, to our Allies prior  to informing the  Admiral.  .                             In the Event of Refusal.    37. If the Allies&apos; terms are refused, which probably  depends on  the extent ofthe German domination, the following operations would be desirable  and should beproceeded with    (a.)  The final elimination of the garrison of the Dardanelles and the occupation of           the Bulair lines.    (b.)  The opening of the Bosphorus.*    (c.)  The  occupation or  destruction (if  not already carried out) of the  various           armament works, and the entire  isolation of Constantinople.    id.) A naval blockade.    (e.)  The occupation of the  country on  either side of  the  Bosphorus, in order to           secure a free  passage  for wheat  and transports.   This  might  involve           extended military operations,  though the Turkish communications AVOUIC!           be weak  and vulnerable.   This   would probably involve the despatch of           military reinforcements.    38.  Summary of proposals put forward for consideration :      (a.) The despatch of an emissary to be sent to the Balkans, not immediately, but           if and when success in the Dardanelles  is assured.   (Paragraphs  5, 6,           and 8.)     (o.) The despatch, if physically possible, of a flotilla to the Danube as soon as the           route to the Black Sea is open.  (Paragraphs 6, 7, and 8.)     (c.) To suggest to the Admiral that he should send a ship to the head of the Gulf           of Xeros to command the high road past Kavak, and to prevent the escape           or reinforcement of  the Dardanelles garrison ;  also  to seize the cable end           at Nagara, and cut the land lines from the Dardanelles  to Constantinople.           (Paragraph 15.)     i]d.) To ask the Russians to send the Black Sea  Fleet to  seal  up the Black Sea           entrance to the Bosphorus, and to cut the cable connecting Constantinople           with Roumania.   (Paragraph 19.)     (e.) To draw the AdmiraPs attention  to  the secondary objectives  discussed in           paragraphs 20 to 28.     (/.) To  send a diplomatist  versed in Turkish  methods to Athens  or Salonica to           assist the Admiral as soon as negotiations commence.  (Paragraph  31.)     (g.) To consider the terms to be offered to the Turks when negotiations commence.           (Paragraphs 33 to c6.)     N.B. Some general instructions might be sent to the Admiral for his guidance inthe event of a successful forcing of the Dardanelles.                                                                   M. P. A.  H.     March 1, 1915.    *  14 is possible that it may be considered desirable to reduce the Bosphorus defences before negotiationsare commenced, in order to hustle the Turks and to prevent them bringing fresh guns&apos; and howitzers intoposition. This depends on a detailed examination of the project.PRINTED FOR THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON. 2/o/1915.
