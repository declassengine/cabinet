WINTER IN  THE BALKANS.                                      Ashton Lodge, Christchurch Road, Reading,My dear Masterman,          .                     November 8, 1915.    AT risk of seeming fussy I will venture to put a few thoughts before you.    I think I am one of the very limited number of Englishmen on the spot who haveroughed  it in the Balkans during a winter.  Do our War Office people  know theconditions which rule there from Christmas to the middle of March ?    It is not much use asking  anybody from the  Legation in Sofia, for I observedour people stuck closely to the house during the winter, or went down the  road theonly good road for short constitutionals.   The suggestion which I once made, that aday&apos;s visit might be paid to a.certain valley in  the Rhodopes where amazing atrocitieswere reported, and which 1 had visited and discovered of  the  kind, was regarded asoutside the possibilities.    Briefly, the weather conditions are very different from anything we know anythingof in these islands.  Winter  is mild along the iEgean littoral (so  I heard,  but knownothing of that part), but even as far south as Adrianople is very severe.  At Lubemitz,a morning&apos;s walk from Miistapha Pasha, which is only a few miles north of Adrianople,the night  temperature  is almost deadly cold  to an Englishman in ordinary winterclothing.   A single rug is very little use, and a few nights  of exposure would ruin anarmy corps.  I wore a sheepskin-lined, long overcoat, thickest knitted  stockings, andlined  gloves, and a cap with ear-lappets, and was  not over-clothed.   One needs thethickest woollen undershirt  and merino pants.  My shooting  boots had extra thicksoles and. were flannel-lined.    With such an outfit sleep was just possible in a shut railway carriage (unwarmed),but in the open I doubt.    I never  saw Bulgarian  troops sleep  out.   Their bridge guards along the linesbuilt shacks of timber, sodded up the walls, and roofed themselves  in with trusses ofmaize straw a foot thick.    Our men need not expect to find villages left for them to occupy.   Every shelterwill be burnt along their line of  advance, and a burnt-out village is no use, as far asmy experience goes.    As you get up into broken country away from the coast you will  find deep snow,and roads coated at intervals with thick ice, most trying  for transport.  Nor can yourely upon sledging, for the  wind will have stripped the snow from the road at intervals,and you come to miles of grit on which a sledge will not travel.  This applies to theopening  months of winter, November  and December.  There will be  spells  of rainwhich turn the country into swamps, in which, as I found, if one comes down one hasthe utmost difficulty in rising, for a hand set down goes up to the shoulder in toughyellow clay.  Draught animals give out, and one had to leave one&apos;s luggage on the hill-side until morning.    The Bulgarian infantry wear very long overcoats and blanket puttees (much, muchthicker  than ours real blanketing).   They  know  that  their winter sets in  withblizzards which are not to  be defied.  A favourite garment  is a couple of sheepskinsworn with the wool inside, the whole forming  a  cuirass  without arms.  One  sees inextra cold snaps tiro such garments worn, one over the other.    About Christmas the real winter sets in.  It is  the time of year most enjoyed bythe people.  There is no wind, no clouds, and  the deep  snow  lies  as  dry as powder,and squeaks under one&apos;s feet.  It will not &quot; bind  &apos;.&apos; nor &quot; ball&quot; under one&apos;s  heel, it isabsolutely  dry.  This makes heavy going for animals.   The sun rises cloudless andsets cloudless, and the sun is quite warm to the skin, but at night the temperature isdown to zero, and must not be played with.    All this points to the need of cutting down transport on the one hand, and, on theother, of abundance of suitable heavy, clothing.
     Sofia, as you know, is some fifteen hundred feet above sea-level, and enjoys  anatrocious climate, and is surrounded by mountains four or five thousand feet higher.Firewood will be a real difficulty, and forests are gone from most of the hills, and onthe plains there are next to no  trees, certainly  not  enough  to rely upon for a greatarmy.  The firewood for General IvanofFs army before Adrianople came from Kostanitzby rail, 100 miles or more away,  and was so valuable  that  each truck had its armedguard to prevent pilfering.  The Bulgars,  during the first war, guarded every culvert,bridge, tunnel, &amp;c, day and night, and  though the line was in their own country,supplemented it  by ox-transport upon a very large scale.     One point more, you must not expect to find  any horses in the country.  The fewI saw were mere ponies, hardy but unbroken.  The oxen are very small;  they are usedin pairs under yokes, and are sturdy little things  and perfectly hardy,  but the buffalo,which are twice as strong, are not hardy, and will  lose their  ears in  the wind frostsunless  these  members  are  covered.  Both oxen and buffalo must be shod, and notoverdriven.   The average Tommy will  overdrive them,  and  spoil his  own game, andbring the whole affeir to a standstill for wrant of transport.    The ferries are only flat-bottomed punts,  poled across, or worked with a cable, buteither way incapable of carrying more than a few men or a couple of animals at a time.This applies to the Lower Maritza River above Adrianople.    I do not know what scale maps you have, but the passes in the Rhodopes are likeCheddar Gorge, only more  so (a good deal more  so), single cart  tracks  fairly wellgraded, but overhung and enfiladed ten times in a mile (I am speaking of the KostanitzGlen and the Chepino Valley,  both in the  Rhodopes.  The Rilo glens  are  as  bad,  orworse,  for  Mount  Rilo is  10,000 feet  high.  The  glen north of Rustendil  is anincredibly narrow limestone gorge, caves, and pot-holes.    (Also the routes from Albania.   Note-C. F. G. M.)                                                 Faithfully yours,                                              (Signed)        H.  M. WALLIS.    Right Hon. C. F. G. Masterman.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON.-22/11/1915.
