NOTES  OF  A  CONVERSATION  WITH  GENERAL  GALLIENI,                        OCTOBER 27, 1915.     I HAD a long conversation  this afternoon with General Gallieni.  It is believed that yesterday evening  M. Viviani offered  him  the  portfolio  of  Minister of War. General Gallieni is said to have accepted with some reluctance, but subject to certain- conditions, one of which was the substitution of a sailor for M. Augagneur as Minister of Marine.  It is not known whether this or certain other  conditions are acceptable to the President of the Republic, but whether he becomes Minister for War or no, General Galiieni&apos;s views are not without importance.     A strong Conservative  himself, he holds with M. Herve that &quot;1&apos;unite de direction&quot; is vital to the successful conduct of the war.  &quot; If we fail,&quot; he said, &quot; to co-ordinate our activities by means of machinery that can regulate from day to day the common action of the Allies we shall fail to win the war.&quot;  He laid strong stress upon the contrast between the situation last May and the situation to-day.  &quot; We have trusted too much,&quot; he said, &quot; to the hypothetical weakening of  the enemy&apos;s  forces weakness invariabhr exaggerated by intelligence officers and local commanders-and not sufficiently to our own prevision and carefully considered plans.&quot;     Last February the probability of a German advance through Serbia and  Bulgaria upon Constantinople was discussed in well-informed quarters, but no  steps were taken to prepare for such an eventuality^     When the German offensive against Serbia began it was already too late to adopt such practical measures as would ensure its failure.  It may be possible now to threaten the lengthy line of German communications by an advance due north from Salonica, but only under unfavourable conditions  and with hastily improvised transport and  indispensable mountain artillery, the difficulty of providing which renders the efficacity of  such  a threat more than doubtful.     In his view we must contemplate the establishment of a complete junction between Germany and Turkey within a  few weeks. It is therefore of first-rate importance that the Allies should immedia&apos;oly and jointly consider  the steps that should be taken in Egypt, India, and North Africa to  guard against  difficulties and  dangers obvious to everyone.   Morocco, he considers, can be safely left in the hands of  General  Liautey and the force under his command. .  &quot; England and France,&quot; he  said, &quot; should  rely in the West and the JNear East upon themselves and their own preparedness, since it is doubtful  whether any  assistance  can be obtained from  Russia  for  many months to come.&quot;     He feels grave doubts whether Egypt can be best defended on her frontiers.  The war, if carried into Syria, will  be mainly an  Oriental  war, and, he  added,  &quot; In  the East the defensive is never  the most prudent form-of military action.&quot;     General Gallieni then reverted to the vital necessity of recasting at once the Allied methods of carrying on the war.   There should, and he emphasised the  point,  be no questions of amour-propre or traditional  usage. The circumstances are too exceptional, and  the  clangers too impending.   &quot;L unite  d&apos;action est la chose essentielle.&quot;   Be then walked to where hung a  fine lithographic chart  of  the battle  of  the Ourques, and  lifting it  with his left hand,  he placed his right forefinger upon the  central point in the great map of the main theatre of Avar.  &quot; Here,&quot; he said, &quot; sits the German Emperor with his Chief of the Staff, and  his director of railways-only these three.; no oue else.   You observe these great lines of railway running parallel from our frontier on the west, through Berlin, to Warsaw in the east.  Our intelligence branch has noted a regiment one clay in Warsaw, which five days later has been fighting  on our front.
Now observe these lines of railway running parallel due  south to the frontiers of theBalkans.  All these carefuUy prepared strategic means of transport are manipulatedfrom  this central point by one, or  at the outside  three, directing  brains.&quot;  How tocounter this formidable threat  and  jam this highly efficient machine is  the  mosturgent problem to-day.-  &quot;   .^                                  . -                            &apos;         E.    October 27, 1915.PR I XT ED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON.-29/10/1915.
