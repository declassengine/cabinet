Rood. 31.5.20.G.0.727 cipher Kay 30th.   Your 84928 D.M.O. Kay 22nd.Situation as follows:&apos;---Soviet system has been adopted by Azerbaijan. Russian Red troops have arrived and communication between Baku and Tiflis ia cut.    ?or tho present Russian Reds appear content with practical control of Azerbaijan and 3prospective control of Georgia. Treaty between Russia and Georgia gavo town and province of Batum&apos;to&apos; Georgia but any-attempted occupation will be resisted by the Ad.1a.rian inhabitants who may invoke the intervention of Turkey. Indecisive fighting between Georgians and Azerbaijan now stopped by armistice.    Although it may be desire of Georgian Government to ? resist ? Bolshevists I do not con-sider Georgian Army capable of resisting any Bolshevik in-vasion even if anxious to do so.    Armenia states she willresist Bolshevists, but has a;,r-* erectly sent her delegaxeS&quot; todiscuss future.     Probably unable to resist, even if supplied with arms and may join Bolshevists as safety egaiust the iurks,Thoroughly efficient military and ? pecuniary support is essentialbefore she can be regarded as appreciable military factor.turkey t steadily watching events.     Turkey and Russia ? recollectmutual antagonism but at present aro ready to use oach other against common enemy. A bad impression against ua is beini? caused by Bolshevik, action in Northorn Porsia.-
9 r; rSituation Batura.     Garrison merely police and against any ? attack would be totally insufficient.     Trad.; at a standstill and labour troubles will shortly arise owing to lack of work.   Oil.pumping ceased and twice lately attempts made to fire the tanks which if successful would*have destroyed the docics.     Bo food for inhabitants except such as is brought by British.    Owing to Baku occupation currency has now become valueless hence administration is now being run at a considerable loss.   Communication by wireless only and liable to be impossible for several days - at a time in summer owing to atmospherics.   Owi%: to ship;inr:. question reinforcement or evacuation of garrison impossible without minimum warning of 10 days.   No useful military purpose being served by retention of Bate and military situation of 3 battalions occupying indefensible town is unsound especially as neither town population nor Georgiana seem to want us to remain.     As eveats in the Caucasus move rapidly and should situation become suddenly dangerous it must be remembered that I am not in a position^ to intervene for nearly a fortnight allowing for delays in communication and fcr collecting shipping.   Any evacuation must be carried out en bloc-; and fair warning to the commercial classes should be &amp;iven.Whitehall Gardens,, 8VW June 2nd, 1920.
