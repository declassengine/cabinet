Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1920.secret.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.WITH reference to, the discussion of the Persian situation in the Cabinet on ^ 5oQo)Friday last (21st May)rand the Note circulated by the Secretary of State for War (covering four memoranda) on Mesopotamian Expenditure (C.P.-1320), I desire to submit certain considerations to my c leagues.   There seems to me to be great danger of our mixing up two entirely different questions, viz.: (a.) The probable future cost of the retention of Mesopotamia as a mandated territory, and(b.) The present actual cost of maintaining our position and defending our interests in Mesopotamia and Persia, as long as the whole of the Near East  Transcaucasia, Anatolia, Syria and now North-Western Persia-are in a state of raging chaos.On the one hand inferences are drawn from (b) with regard to (a) which are entirely unjustifiable. On the other hand, propositiona are put forward, which seem to suggest that we can at once afford to reduce (b), regardless of the great and manifold dangers which threaten us, as long as all the countries of the Near East are in a condition of complete political instability.Something like a panic seems to have seized on the public mind I am not sure that it has not affected our own minds-at the discovery, that we are incurring a military expenditure of 18 millions a year in respect of Mesopotamia. In certain organs of the press an outcry is already being raised about the intolerable burden which the occupation of that country is supposed to be going to entail on us, and the conclusion is drawn that we ought incontinently to abandon the most valuable part of it. And certainly, if Mesopotamia were going to impose on us a burden of 18 millions a year, we should very soon wash our hands of it. But that under normal conditions the defence of Mesopotamia should cost us anything like that sum, appears to me absolutely fantastic. I venture to say that one-tenth of that amount is much nearer the mark, and I dordt know why we should assume that even this expenditure must permanently fall on the taxpayers of Great Britain.By &quot; normal conditions &quot; I do not mean that the surrounding countries need be entirely peaceful and orderly. Whatever may be the future government of Kurdistan or of Syria, it is likely that for years to come the Kurdish mountaineers on the north, the nomacl Arabs on the west of Mesopotamia, will be pretty troublesome neighbours. But in the British Empire we have plenty of experience of the cost of policing and defending countries quite as large, and exposed to quite as many dangers, internal and external, as Mesopotamia would be exposed to, if we had nothing to guard against but sporadic raids of Kurds or Arabs. The Sudan, a country far larger, in many of its regions far more inaccessible, and marching on two sides with semi-civilised or unsettled countries, involves a military expenditure borne by Egypt-of undei two millions a year. The defence of our vast East African Empire costs even less. Without attempting at this time to go into the details of a permanent defence scheme for Mesopotamia with regard to which the memorandum of Air-Marshal Trenchard reveals interesting possibilities I will only say that no inferences whatever as to the cost of such a scheme can be drawn from the cost of the present Army of Occupation.   The two things have simply no relation to one another.On the other hand, the fact that that army is vastly in excess of anything that should be permanently required for the defence of Mesopotamia, has no bearing on the question whether we can afford to begin reducing it right away. While I am in entire agreement with the Secretary of State for War as to the necessity and the possibility of holding Mesopotamia, in the long run, with very moderate forces, I am &apos; frankly alarmed at his idea that &quot; a prompt and drastic curtailment of expenditure &quot; in that quarter is the paramount necessity of the moment. It may well be that the considerable number of men we have in that country are ill distributed. I think they are.   If it was merely a question of Mesopotamia, I dare say a considerable[3297]
reduction could be effected right away. But I cannot urge too strongly, that at this critical juncture it is necessary lo take a wider view. It really is essential to take account of the military position in the Near East as a whole, at any rate until some semblance of order is re-established in all these distracted countries. We may &quot; deflate &quot; too fast. This is just one of those cases, in which precipitate reduction, the rage for immediate saving, is likely to involve us in much greater and quite unnecessary expenditure in the long run.In this connection I am quite unable to understand how we can afford to disinterest ourselves in what may happen in Persia. If we are ever to hold Mesopotamia with such moderate forces as the Secretary of State for War contem-plates, and which are certainly all that we ought to require, we must have a stable and a friendly Persia on our flank. With a chaotic or, worse still, a hostile Persia our position in Mesopotamia would be untenable, or only tenable at such a cost, that we should certainly end by giving it up.I will not dwell on the strong reasons which we have in any case for maintaining the arrangement between us and Persia, which at great pains and cost and with, as I venture to think, great diplomatic skill, we have recently succeeded in concluding. By all accounts Persia, under its present Government, has made in the past twelve months greater strides in the establishment of order and the revival of trade than she had done in many preceding years. It will be a great blow to our credit and influence in the East, if all we have done in Persia is to be wiped out, and that country once more plunged into anarchy. From the material point of view, too, the loss will be serious. Our economic interests in Persia are considerable, in one important respect almost vital. But for the moment I am mainly concerned with the reaction of events in Persia, which may or may not be regarded as directly concerning us, on our position in Mesopotamia, for which country we undoubtedly are responsible.It is urged that an invasion of Mesopotamia from the Persian side is an improbable contingency. That may be so to-day, but the position would wear a different aspect if Persia were to become part of a Bolshevik Empire extending from Archangel to the Persian Gulf. It is not, however, so much a question of direct invasion. It is not only or mainly by the employment of military force that Bolshevism has swept over Siberia, over Turkestan, and is now sweeping over Transcaucasia, but by a combination of menace from without with propaganda stirring up all the internal elements of disorder. That is the danger which threatens Persia to-day, and that is the danger, which would threaten Mesopotamia to-morrow, if Persia were to be engulfed, as Siberia, as Turkestan, as Trans-Caucasia have already been, by the Bolshevist wave. Is it not self-evident that under such conditions the peaceful development of Mesopotamia under British influence would be impossible? We might indeed, though I dont believe we would, hold on to it, but we could only hold it with a large army maintained at a deterrent cost.The question is, what can be done to keep this danger at a distance ? The best solution, if it is a possible one, would be peace a real peace with Russia. I do not, of course, mean peace at any price. On the contrary, I regard it as a condition sine qua non that Russia should desist from making mischief, whether by direct invasion or by stirring up internal disorders, not only in India and those parts of South-Western Asia, which we actually occupy, but in Persia and Afghanistan as well. And personally I am quite convinced that she has so much to gain by getting rid of our hostility, that she would be prepared to give such an undertaking. It may be said that she would not keep it. But in that case, i.e., if she is resolved to go on attacking us, we have got to fight her. whether we like it or not, and we should surely be in a much stronger moral position to do so if she had made peace with us and broken it. My own belief, however, is that she would keep it, at any rate for a time, and even the gain of a certain amount of time would be of immense advantage to us under present circumstances.   And that for two reasons 1. We do not know in the least what will happen in Russia in the immediate future. It may well be that, if she is let alone, internal problems will engage all her energies, or a government may emerge, which will be less dangerous to the world than are her present rulers with their programme of universal revolution.2. We ourselves urgently require some little time in which to turn round and try to stabilize the position in all South-Western Asia, where everything is still &quot; at a loose end,&quot; not to mention the repercussion of the unsettled state of this whole region upon Egypt and India. Our own position in Persia and Mesopotamia, the French position in Syria and Cilicia, the future of all the
rest of Turkey in Asia are still quite indeterminate, and the settlement of all these problems will be intolerably complicated by the continuance of Bolshevik interference.Peace with Russia, even if it were only a transient peace, would be of inestimable importance. But it may not be possible to conclude peace, or only after protracted negotiations. And meanwhile the position in Persia may be hopelessly compromised, unless we take prompt action to save it. We do not want, we never have wanted, to make ourselves responsible for the government of Persia. But we do want to help Persia to stand on her own legs. If she were to fall into the hands of Russia, or to become a dependent ally of Russia, our whole position in the East \vould be gravely imperilled and the cost of maintaining it immeasurably increased. The immediate danger is, that, unless we can succeed in propping it up, the present reforming and pro-British Government of Persia will fall and be replaced by an unfriendly Government leaning on Russia, or simply by general chaos. This is so serious a prospect that, in our own interest, even if we had no moral obligations to the friendly element in Persia, we are bound, as it seems to me, to make every effort to avert the threatened disaster. And I believe we can perfectly well avert it even now, if we make it evident by our actions, that we mean to stand by our friends and to do anything that is practicable to uphold the system of government which we have been helping to set up. To my mind it is the moral effect of the attitude which we adopt upon the Government and people of Persia, which is likely to be the decisive factor. It is not so much an invasion of Central Persia by the Bolsheviks which is the immediate danger. They may overrun the province of Azerbaijan, and that in itself would be bad enough. But I doubt, whether they have the means, even if they have the intention, of sending an expedition against Teheran. The immediate danger is, that the Persians generally will lose faith in our willingness or in our power stand by them, and that the Bolshevik elements in the country will thus be enabled to gain the upper hand. But it is evident that if we have no policy but that of gradual withdrawal, the Persians are bound to lose all faith. If after giving up Meshed on the one hand, and being unceremoniously bundled out of Enzeli on the other, we now retreat first from Kazvin thus uncovering Teheran to Hamadan, and then from Hamadan to Kermanshah, and so on, what can we expect but that the Persians will give us up and look elsewhere for salvation ? Unless it is militarily quite impracticable, it would be far better to hold on, at least temporarily, to the Kasvin, Hamadan, Kermanshah line, and strengthen it, if need be, from Mesopotamia. But it is no use merely hanging on there, unless we at the same time help the Persian Government to develop such of its own defensive forces as can be relied on the Cossacks being evidently worse than useless. And the Persian Government is itself anxious to do this ; it may, however, need a further advance of money for the purpose. But this is not a case, to which our resolution not to lend any more money to any of our Allies properly applies. It is not primarily a question of helping an Ally, but of securing our own vital interests in Persia and saving all that we have already spent on that country from being completely wasted. A Bolshevik revolution in Persia would involve consequences for the British Empire, which it would be worth our while to spend not one, but many millions to avert.The note of the Secretary of State for War (C.P.-1320) raises a number of questions affecting Mesopotamia other than those which have been referred to above. I do not propose to go into them in this memorandum, which has already run to excessive length, although on another occasion I may have something to say about them. The question of the administration of the mandated territories Palestine and Mesopotamia is undoubtedly an important one, and must be considered in connection with the systems to be adopted for the future exercise of British authority, or influence, in other Arab countries Egypt, the Hedjaz, &amp;c. and the control of those systems from home. But these problems, important as they are, do not seem to me of the same absolute urgency as the matters with which this memorandum deals. Indeed, it may be doubted whether they can be properly discussed, till the extent and nature of our responsibilities in all this region the boundaries of the mandated territories, the character of the &quot;mandates,&quot; the future constitution of Egypt, &amp;c- assume a clearer shape than th y at present possess. It seems to me to be both premature and somewhat ill-omened to attempt to-day to lay down a plan for the administration of Mesopotamia, for it is my intimate conviction that, unless the dangers which now threaten us in that quarter are faced in time, there will in another twelvemonth be no question of our administering Mesopotamia at all.M.May 24, 1920.
