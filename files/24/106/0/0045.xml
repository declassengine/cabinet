.&apos;   155SECRET. 7 -THE CABINET.PRESERVATION OF THE CLOTH HALL AND CATHEDRALAT YPRES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.In November last, I circulated to my colleagues a paper (CP. 123) on Battle Memorials referring to the preservation of a part of Ypres in its ruined state.This Paper was discussed at a Conference of Ministers on the 9th December (Conclusion 3), when the expenditure of public money on Memorials at Ypres and else-where was approved in principle and a committee appointed to consider the matter. The Committee, for various reasons, has not yet met.- My attention has recently been called to the fact that the Belgian Government have now before them alternative schemes with regard to the reconstruction of Ypres, a decision upon which is imminent. These schemes are shown in a report of the representative of the Imperial War Graves Commission in Belgium, which is given below.The first scheme, while providing for the reconstruction of the town, secures the permanent preservation of the Cloth Hall, the Cathedral and the immediate surroundings. The second contemplates the reconstruction of Ypres with the rebuilding of houses round and in the Grande Place up to their original frontages.I am given to understand that, though under the second scheme the Cloth Hall and the Cathedral would be left as they are for the present, the Burgomaster, in whom the second scheme originates, contemplates ultimately that these ruins should be pulled down and rebuilt.I am strongly of the opinion that, before it is too late, the Government should take whatever steps it can to prevent the adoption of a proposal involving the ultimate obliteration of these ruins, and the completion by the inhabitants of Ypres of the work of destruction left unfinished by the Germans.A letter has been forwarded to the Foreign Office asking that a protest should be made to the Belgian Government against the adoption of the second alternative and commending the first as providing for the permanent preservation of ruins which for the British nation will always stand as symbols of the Great War.W. S. C.The War Office, 26th May, 1920.APPENDIX.&apos; RECONSTRUCTION OF YPRES.(Extract from a report of the representative of the Imperial War Graves Commission,Brussels.)With reference to my previous letters on the above subject, I am unofficially informed that the plans of two schemes for the reconstruction of Ypres are now being considered in the Ministry of the Interior, and that a decision as to&quot; which is to be adopted will be come to within the next fourteen days.(B20/248)   100  5/20  H&amp;s  8247wo
These two schemes are as follows : (i.) The preservation of the ruins of the Halles and Cathedral as ruins, surrounded by a garden and belt of trees, comprising within its limits the Grande Place and certain adjoining streets and property, with the consequent expropria-tion of certain owners (possibly 65 or 70), and alterations to the general street plan of the town.(ii.) The re-building of the town with certain slight modifications of the old street plan, with the consequent re-building of nouses round and on the Grande Place, up to their original frontages; the Halles and Cathedral to be left as they are.The first scheme is that of the educated and well-informed opinion of Belgium, and is not put forward solely with the view to a memorial of the defence of the town, but from an aesthetic point of view.It is bitterly opposed by the Bourgmestre, his architect and a small following of the older Ypres families, who, with the Bourgmestre, believe that he is an authority on archaeological matters.The second scheme is put forward by the Bourgmestre and his followers, with the ulterior motive of carrying out their own further scheme to rebuild the central buildings because, once the houses are rebuilt on their former sites and frontages, the ruins will have to be pulled down for every reason, artistic or otherwise, and once down, an agitation will be set on foot for money with which to rebuild.This second scheme is opposed by all educated and well-informed Belgians, but, owing to the difficulty for various reasons, of compelling the Bourgmestre and his following to give way. is likely to be adopted unless the first scheme is supported from outside.Having regard to what took place at the Conference of July last year in Ypres,* it is thought that an appeal by the Battle Exploits Memorials Committee or some other such well-informed official body in England on behalf of the first scheme and a protest against the second scheme may be of assistance to the supporters of the first scheme.* CP. 123, paragraph 15: &quot;A conference was held at Ypres with the Belgian authorities, and it waB agreed that the site of the Cloth Hall and Cathedral should be railed off and that no reconstruction should take place there pending the decision as to the use of such site.&quot;
