From Viceroy, 15th May 1920. (Received 17th, 10 a.m.)617 S. Secret. Your telegram of 13th May. Mussoorie Conference. DoLLs telegraphs 14th May :-&quot; Following letter from Tarsi: &quot; &apos; Afghan troops can retire from Tandisar and we can require of Abdul Rahman Khan, brother of Mehtar of Chitral, to remain quiet and go back from Lambarbat. (R.) (Two corrupt groups) but according to your own statement no aggression or interference should take place on the part of opposite party until our discussions end in a settlement. You have no doubt up to this time obtained hint or permission from His Excellency the Viceroy in this matter.&apos;   May I reply as follows&quot; &apos; I am much gratified that Afghan Government at your instance has recognised and accepted friendly (?) wishes of Government of India in the matter of the frontier incidents which had temporarily interrupted our conversations. My Government will arrange that during our conversations at Mussoorie our forces shall not occupy Tandisar, so that there shall be no action on our side which might give rise to local misunderstandings. I need not assure you that if Tandisar and Chitral incidents are satisfactorily adjusted British authorities will, as always, do their best to prevent any appearance of aggression ,or hostility on their side and I trust we may then be able to resume our discussions with good hope of mutual profit.&apos; &quot;   End of (R).We have replied: &quot; Your proposed reply approved. But it is noticed that there is no mention of VVaziristan either in Mahmud Tarsi&apos;s letter or in your proposed reply, and in view of your telegram of the 13th May, 38 S., the above approval is given on the understanding that Mahmud Tarsi will be left in no doubt whatsoever that the understanding given to prevent any appearance of aggression or hostility refers solely to Afghan territory and not to Waziristan.   Chief of the General Staff concurs.&quot;
