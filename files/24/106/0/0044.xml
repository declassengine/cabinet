1 r; *SECRET,HiFrom Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2olh May 1020. (Received 10.30 pan.)Clear the line.657 S. Tandisar lias been evacuated by the Afghans as well as Lambabat, but we have not yet heard from Dobbs that official conversations have been resumed. When they are we shall issue a communique, text of which will be telegraphed to you. Information from an absolutely reliable source shows that Amir has (? instructed) Mahmud Tarzi to do all in his power to obtain a written reply from Dobbs about Waziristau, but if this is impossible arid likely to lead to a breach of relations, then he is to begin conversations. Similar information is to the effect that Sardar Nasrulla Khan died on 19th May after being ill for a month and having been &quot; attended by his own doctor.&quot;
