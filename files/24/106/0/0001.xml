SECRET.   &apos; COPY NO.CABIFIT .C. P. 1301.GAS WARFARE,Memorandum by. the. President of, tho&apos; Board ofEducation.Previous Papers:- CP&apos;5. 1211, 1218&quot;; 12^-6 &amp; 1278.In view of the telegram which   the Secretary to theCabinet has addressed to Mr. Balfour on the subject of Gasef erence:- V/Warfare,x I. wish, briefly, to place on record my views upon this cabinet 27 &apos; &apos;..20) branch of the military art.on elusion(b). &quot;Vhen it was first made known that .Gas was-being employedby the Germans., the news raas received with universal horror and disgust.   Even in antiquity the use of poison jn warfare was con-damnsd and although, in one form or another, poison has always been an available ^eaoon and has indeed been 000 as lona lly used, the sentiment of humanity has, on the whole, been strong enough to restrain honourable combatants from resorting to it. The first instinct of our People was right.   The British public&quot; thought that poison gas was a low game and they think so still.&apos;The only question now worth discussing is. whether the British Government should make an effort to persuade other Powers, either by direot negotiation or through, the agency of the Counail of the League of Nations, to desist.from the employment of this expedient or at least to suspend further development of it, until the whole question of terminating or moderating- its use has been thoroughly explored.     I hold that it is-a duty which the British Government owes to civilization to take this course.It is argued, on the other hand, that gas is cheap, that it is&apos;humane., that it is likely to be peculiarly valuable to the British Empire in&apos;its numerous conflicts with uncivilised foes, that it is impossible to prohibit its use or the scientific exploration of its possibilities, and that if we do not press on with developments npw we shall fall hopelessly in arrears.1W
1.        Acto the argument of cheapness, all experience shows that a new development in the art of war invariably involves addition-al cost.   The cost of gas will not &quot;be a substitute but an incre-ment.2.        With respect to the humanity of this new weapon, I would observe .(i)   that we are not yet in a position to judge of thepem-alient effects, of gas.es upon the constitutions of the men who have been gassed.(ii)   that the British estimate of the comparative lightness of many if the casualties inflicted upon our Army by gas in the recent war is largely affected by the ex-perience cf Mustard Gas, a temporary expedient to which German mi.i iteiy -scjence would not again recur for the very reaeon that it does not inflict a sufficient proportion of major casualties;. (iii)   that although it   may no doubt be possible to inventpainless or comparatively painless gases, it is equally possible to discover gases which are even more painful than the tie which have hitherto been employed;(iv)   that the use of poison once admitted, its extensions are infinite and so easy of employment that the populations of large cities might easily be destroyed, e.g., by the use of germs in bombs or by test tubes in water supplies- (v)   that the use of poison gas in bombing from thft air is probably calculated to increase the evils, already far too great, inflicted upon civilian non-combatants by modern warfare.3.        The use of this ureapon against an uncivilised enemypossessing little or no medioal equipment, is clearly open tospeoial objections, apart from the psychological., issues touched on in the Minute-of the Secretary of State for India. .4.        It is no doubt true that it would be very difficult,, if not impossible,, to supervise and to limit chemical research which maybe undertaken in laboratories for the purpose of elaborating theart of gas warfare..   It should,, however, be possible to ascertain whether an Army is providing itself with an expensive gas equip-ment,. whether it is using a Manual of Gas Drill and making chemical warfare the basis of part of its regular discipline.   There is nocountry in the world in which a million men can be made to undergo a particular kind of discipline in secrdt.   If, therefore,, theGovernments of the Great Powers wore to undertake to abstain frompreparing ahemioal warfare and were to &quot;break their undertaking,the fact would certainly become known.
-    18.5*.        Thorn is nothing whatever in the. argument that the &quot;permanent interests of the Amy &quot;/ill ho injured by a halt in the development of this department of m.ffl itary activity.   We do not propose to embark upon another groat 7ar at present and there is planty of time before us in which to develop this bran oh of clv-mical knowledge if it should be found necessary to do so.It is perhaps too muoh to be expected of human nature that having once elaborated with considerable technical ingenuity a now weapon of destruction capable.of endless developments, it should now decide to abstain from using it.   It is only too likely that the-vested intellectual interests created by the War will be strong enourh to impose upon the unfortunate peoples of the world the con-tinued use of this odijas expedient and that it may be impossible to rev--rt to the limitations which the good sense of humanity has hitherto succeeded in imposing upon belligerents.   I quite realise that we may be obliged to resign ourselves to this prospect, but let it not be without an honest effort to recover the honourable tradition which we have previously held to be binding upon the Civilised world.   If we are not prepared to make this effort, the sooner we delete the Clause in the Treaty of Versailles which prohibits gas preparations in the German Army the better.Let it, however, be. realised &apos;:&apos;hat is implied by this decision.   It is no a decision upon a matter of military-and naval technique-, whioh may safely be left to experts.   The big&apos; question is raised whether or no the Peoples who have suffered so much in this War are entitled to express a judgment upon the developments in the art of war which have been introduced by our enemies in defianoe of all limitations hitherto accepted.    I do not think that ,T,e should be hurried by our Naval and Military&apos; Advisers into a precipitate acceptance of innovations which wo have more than once condemned, which we have forbidden to the Germans, which are repugnant to th^ .ffeelings of the great mass of our people, and whii are easily capable, of developments from whirih imagination recoils.(Initialled)   -H.
