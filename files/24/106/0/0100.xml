Nil.Part 11. Departmental.The Trade Board Movement.The number of Trade Boards set up by the Department is increasing at a rapid rate. At the date of the armistice there were 15 Boards in existence.  By the 3rd of March, 1920, there were 38 in operation, and the number has now reached 51.   The number of trades covered is not quite so large, for though the greater part of these Boards cover the whole of Great Britain, in one or two cases such as the aerated waters industry, hat, cap,, and millinery trade, dressmaking and women&apos;s light clothing, there are separate Boards for England and Wales and for Scotland.  The number includes also Boards in Ireland parallel to those set up for similar trades in Great Britain.   It is estimated, however, that 2,000,000 people have already been brought within the scope of the Boards&apos; activities, and there are prospects that the increase in the number of Boards will continue rapidly for some time to come.  The first step has already been taken to bring the distributive trades within the scope of the Trade Boards Act by setting up a Board for the milk distributive trade in England and Wales.  When this movement has been advanced sufficiently to-cover the other branches of the distributive trade, with regard to which negotiations are already well advanced, and to include food manufacturing, embroidery, lace, catering,(0 2005)   150  6/20 H&amp;S - 2 H
246and ostrich feather and artificial flower-making, for which negotiations are also in progress, it is believed that some four million and a half workers will benefit from the activities of the Trade Boards. This development, it is hoped, may be complete within a year. At the same time steps have been taken in one or two cases to enlarge the scope of Boards already in existence. Thus, for example, the scope of the shirt-making Trade Board has been extended to include the manufacture of certain other articles such as ties and neck-wear.Questions of organisation have in one or two cases presented some slight difficulty. The establishment of separate Boards for England and Wales and for Scotland in the aerated waters trade, has led to the establishment of differing minimum rates, and to a suggestion on the part of the Board for England and Wales, which has fixed the higher rate, that it would be better to establish a single Board for the whole island. The Minister has adhered to the decision in favour of a separate Board for Scotland. Discussions have also taken place between the Trade Boards established in Great Britain for the rope, twine and net industry, the flax and hemp industry and the jute trade on the question of co-ordination of the work of these Boards, which deal with industries not infrequently carried on in one and the same factory. The opinion of these Boards, who have since discussed separately various proposals made at the conference, is for the moment divided. Another question of organisation which in one instance is causing some difficulty, is the question of the method of voting. The Ready-made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring Board (Great Britain) and the employers&apos; side of the Retail Bespoke Tailoring Board (Great Britain), are of opinion that the regulations governing the procedure of the Board should be amended so as to provide for voting by sides, and the co-operation of the employers&apos; side in the work of the Boards will probably be doubtful until this &quot;question is settled.The nature of the activities of the Trade Boards has already been sufficiently indicated in this Report for them to be passed over in this place with only slight mention. The work in connection with the fixing of wage rates which is the main work of the Board, continues to be pressed on with great vigour, not only as regards the establishment of minimum time-rates, but also as regards piece-work rates, piece-work basis time-rates, overtime rates, and learners&apos; rates. An extension of activities of considerable interest has recently been made in one or two cases, where the Trade Boards have agreed to act as National Trade Advisory Committees for the purpose of the training of disabled men. This has been the case, for example, with the Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board, and also the Trade Board for the ready-made and wholesale bespoke tailoring trade who have delegated these functions to their Administrative Committee.Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press. Topics of Discussion.The paucity of noteworthy articles in the Labour and Socialist press is even more pronounced this week than it has been in the past two weeks. The questions of Russia and Ireland, of high prices and of rent restrictions, are practically the only topics dealt with, and the remarks upon them are not too helpful. These three issues are, however, each of very great importance and the development of each of them will affect the Labour situation. It is noteworthy that these topics are all of a political character; several important industrial issues are also pending, but no mention of them is made.Ireland and Poland:The concern of the I.L.P. writers with the so-called Polish offensive against Russia continues to be their principal pre-occupation. Mr. Philip Snowden and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald both deal with this matter, but their remarks are mainly useful as illustrating the differences in outlook of these two gentlemen. Mr. Philip Snowden is pessimistic. An appeal is being made to Trade Union members to arrange a 24-hour strike in support of Russia. Mr. Snowden doubts whether any such strike will take place. Though the British workers are ready every day to strike on matters of workshop discipline or wages, Mr. Snowden thinks &quot; they are incapable of organising resistance to a capitalist militarist conspiracy which affects their economic condition a thousand times more.&quot; He condemns the Parliamentary Labour Party for the part it has taken in the House of Commons dis-cussions of this matter, and attributes their failure to the attitude of the Party during the war towards the Government of the day.  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, on the other hand, in
3247his weekly article to &quot; Forward,&quot; is carried away by his optimism. There is nothing in the article that is worthy of quotation, but the article is a series of self-congratulations that the Government on this question has delivered itself into the hands of the Independent Labour Party. As was the case last week, &quot; The Call&quot; is more concerned with the way in which developments on these issues may affect the position of the British Socialist Party. An article appears from Mr. F. Tanner which is an attack upon the recognised Labour leaders for &quot; preaching the gospel of conciliation, increased production, and the League of Nations &quot; at the very time when this alleged capitalist conspiracy against the Soviet Government was being organised. In a leading article this paper takes credit for the B.S.P. on the action of the dockers in holding up the &quot; Jolly George,&quot; and it is urged that similar action must be taken towards Ireland. In. the &quot; Socialist &quot; Mr. Sean McLoughlin discusses the question whether socialists should aid the Sinn. Fein Party in its efforts to establish an Irish Republic. He arrives at the conclusion that such support should be afforded because it will only need due vigilence on the part of the socialist move-ment to transform th.3 Irish Republic when it comes into existence, from a political State into a workers&apos; republic. &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; attempts some defence of the Polish Government, but he adopts the general attitude that the Polish Government before taking offensive measures should have referred the whole question for advice to the League of Nations. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; gives great prominence to a resolution on the subject of Russia passed at the annual conference of the Dock, AVharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union at Plymouth.Prices and Profiteering.The discussion on the subject of prices mainly deals with the efforts of some of the more popular daily newspapers to persuade the public that a sharp and continued fall in prices is at hand. This effort is condemned on all sides. Mr. H. M. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot; remarks that the late autumn and winter of 1920 and 1921 will be a trying time, and this newspaper manufacture of fallacious cheapness at the beginning of summer will only make the public feeling more bitter when the real pinch comes. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, is equally critical, but it may be observed that in describing the causes of such fluctuations in prices as have already taken place it commits the same error as the daily press of confusing American and British evidence. In preparation for the coming Labour inquiry into the causes of high prices, this leading article outlines the I.L.P. attitude on the subject. It is laid down that there will be no permanent fall in prices until the Peace Treaties have been revised, peace established throughout the world, the ruined countries of Central Europe restored, wasteful expenditure stopped and the financial position of the Allied Governments put upon a square footing. The &quot; New Age &quot; is profoundly sceptical as to the prospects of the Labour inquiry into the causes of high prices.Increase of Tient and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill.This Bill excites very general attention. The most general criticism, repeated in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; &quot; British Citizen,&quot; the &quot; Clarion &quot; and &quot; Nation,&quot; is that the Bdl is vaguely drafted and lacks adequate definitions. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; regrets that the scope of the Bill does not extend to business premises, and the &quot; Democrat&quot; describes it as a fairly comprehensive tenants&apos; charter. Mr. R. B. Suthers, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; expresses the opinion that the provisions with regard to increases of rent should operate in more gradual stages. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; naturally, advocates a strike against the provisions of the Bill, and calls for the setting up of street Soviets by the women of the working classes. It may be noted that this paper advertises and applauds the reported decision of the South. Wales miners not to invest any of their money in housing bonds.The Go-operative Congress.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; deals in a special article with the scheme which was put before the Co-operative Congress for the co-ordination of the political and electoral activities of the Co-operative movement, the Trades Union Congress and the National Labour Party. It is suggested that two conditions must first be satisfied before such co-ordination can achieve very great success. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; points out that while the National Labour Party is always apt to speak of nationalisation, the Co-operative movement speaks of the co-operative commonwealth. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; believes that this difference is superficial, but suggests that a survey should be made in order to decide which industries shall be nationalised and which put on a co-operative basis, or else when the Labour Party is in a position to put its programme into action, serious misunderstanding may(C 2005) 2 H 2
248arise. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; also suggests that the co-operative movement must improve the condition of its employees, and must harmonise its views on the status of its employees with the growing Trade Union demand for participation in the control of industry.The Confederation Generate du Travail.In a leading article &quot; Justice &quot; deals with the general strike movement in France which commenced upon May 1st. A lesson is drawn from the experiences of the C.G.T. that it is not necessarilv the extremists who think the clearest, and that the wildness of a man&apos;s language must not he taken as an indication of the sincerity of his socialism. &quot; Many of those who talk and write most coolly are thorough-going socialists willing and anxious to go the whole hog if they felt it was possible to do so successfully.&quot; It is suggested that Trade Union leaders should organise themselves to meet the attacks being made upon them from the extremists, and &quot; Justice &quot; apparently believes that these attacks are, in part at least, inspired from Moscow.Part IV.-General Topics.General Survey of the Week.With, reference to the industrial situation, there is little to add to what was said last . week with regard to the many important issues which may come to a crisis in the near future. Attention may, however, be drawn to two features in the situation at the end of the week. The strike of steam service men employed in the Sheffield trade, members of the National Union of Enginemen, &amp;c, is dealt with in greater detail below, and is a good illustration of the difficulties caused by different unions catering for the same classes of workers; and the movement throughout the country for increased wages for the employees of co-operative societies.With regard to the more general situation more particularly the whole problem of the cost of living, and the attitude of the trade union movement to Ireland and Poland very little development has taken place since last week, but the resumption of the Parliamentary Session which may mean discussions on the Unemployment Insurance Bill and the Hours of Employment Bill, the Rent Restrictions Bill and other Bills affecting Labour, together with the near approach of the annual conference of the Labour Party, promise important developments in the near future.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces policies current for the week ended the 21st May, 1920, was 203,800 (202,300 lodged by men and 1,500 by women). The previous week (the 14th May) there were 206,905 policies current, 205,265 being lodged by men and 1,640 by women.68,698 unemployment books (46,078 by males and 22,620 by females) remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 21st May, 1920, making an increase of 1,141 since the 14th May. At the later date 44,333 books were lodged by males and 23,224 by females (a total of 67,557).At the 14th May, 58 policies remained lodged by short-time workers, of which 50 per cent, were in the insured industries. All the insured industries policies were lodged in the Engineering and Ironfounding Group.The total live register at all Employment Exchanges at the week ended the 21st May was 270,336 men, 46,560 women, 21,529 juveniles, compared with 273,772 men, 48,529 women, 23,076 juveniles a week ago (the 14th May) and 282,369 men, 49,158 women, 26,291 juveniles a month ago.Labour and Ireland.The trouble at the North Wall station, Dublin, has continued since last week&apos;s report without any change, and refusals on the part of railwaymen to deal with military stores or to help in the transport of troops are reported from the other principal ports in, the South of Ireland Queenstown, Cork, Wexford. Three vessels have been held up . at Avon-mouth owing to the refusal of the dockers to load motor lorries and vehicles for Ireland, but no further extension of this action on this side of the Irish Sea has been reported.The executive of the National Union of Railwaymen considered the situation in Ireland in so far as it affects their own men, on 27th May, and reaffirmed their previous resolution, noted in this report last week, to submit the whole question to the full meeting of the Triple Alliance for which they had asked. The sub-committee of the Triple Alliance, which consists of the presidents and secretaries of the constituent bodies, met on Monday the
24931st May. It was decided that the position in regard to Ireland was such as to warrant the consideration of the problem by the organised Trade Union movement in Britain as a whole, and therefore that the matter should be referred to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, with an urgent request that a special congress should be convened to determine the attitude of British labour towards the production and handling of munitions of war for Ireland, and Poland. In this reference to the Trades Union Congress the Triple Alliance is following the precedents created last year in the campaign for the withdrawal of conscription, the withdrawal of British troops from Russia, the raising of the blockade, and the release of conscientious objectors.The decision of the N.U.R. Executive that the strike movement in Ireland should not be extended pending a decision of the Triple Alliance has given an opportunity to the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress to take over the sympathetic movement in Ireland. A meeting in Dublin of members of the N.U.R. was held on Sunday, 30th May, and was addressed by Mr. Thomas Farren and Mr. Johnston (President and Secretary of this body). The railway men were told that the Irish Labour Party would support the railwaymen&apos;s and dockers&apos; strikes and would provide the sinews of war. Mr. Farren. declared that war would be waged until the last man of the Army of Occupation was removed from Ireland.The National Executive Committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet-makers and Joiners have passed the following resolution: &quot; That the British Government in refusing to allow Ireland the form of government chosen by the Irish people, and in assisting Poland in her attack on the Russian Republic is betraying all the principles for which our nation fought, and that the most effective way in which a protest can be made is for the organised workers to refuse to manufacture or transport munitions of war for Ireland or Poland.&quot;Labour and Russia.The hesitation of the N.U.R. Executive in dealing with the conveyance of military stores to Ireland may be contrasted with the instruction which has been issued by authority of the same body to members of the N.U.R. to refuse to handle any material intended to assist Poland against the Russian peopled The questions of Irish and Russian self-deter-mination are closely connected with each other in the mind of British Trade Unionism,, and this difference in action towards the two matters on the part of the NU.R. executive must not be taken to represent any fundamental difference of policy on the two questions. This difference in action results from the obvious facts that the amounts of munitions of war proceeding to Poland from this country are strictly limited, and refusals to deal with them will not lead to any serious practical consequences on foreign trade : while similar conduct with regard to Ireland would not only lead to an interruption in goods traffic with Ireland, but would bring about a direct conflict between the trade union movement and the Government. Apart from this decision of the N.U.R. executive, the action taken with regard to Polish munitions has been limited in extent and entirely unofficial in character. This unofficial action, however, has met with enthusiastic approval at the conferences of trade unions recently held, and from these resolutions it may be judged that the whole of the transport workers will support action taken by any of their members in this matter.Unemployment Insurance Bill.  -This Bill has been a principal topic of discussion at many of the Trades Union. Congresses which have been held in the last two weeks. The Trade Unions have generally adopted resolutions hostile to the admission of friendly societies and other non-trade union approved societies under the Health Insurance Acts, to participate in the administration of the unemployment scheme. On the other hand, the friendly society conferences which were held in great numbers during the Whitsuntide week all passed resolutions affirming their claim to share in the administration of unemployment insurance. This question of the position of friendly societies and similar bodies under the Bill appears to have been almost the only issue in connection with the Bill discussed. It does not appear that the action of the Labour Party members of Standing Committee, in securing a revision of the schedules to the Bill so as to increase all the benefits and to make the Bill as it now stands financially unworkable, has attracted much notice in the country at large.The Cost of Living.There is nothing further to report with regard to the setting up of a special com-mittee of inquiry, representative of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party* It is reported that this instruction has since been withdrawn. (C 2005) 2 H 3
250and the Co-operative Movement to consider the cause of high prices, and to discuss ways and means of bringing down the cost of living. It may be noted that the Independent Labour Party is to hold a special national conference to formulate proposals on this question on June 12th. Resolutions adopted by the executive committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners may be taken as giving some guide as to the policy which will be propounded on behalf of Labour. The resolutions call for a levy on wealth, the abandonment of all militarist and imperialistic schemes, and the drastic reduction of expenditure on armaments, the acquisition for the community of labour, railways, coal mines and shipping, and the immediate revision of the Peace Treaty. Such proposals as these, together with the scheme adopted by the miners last December for a continuance of subsidies on articles of necessity and a reduction of taxation upon articles of food may therefore well be taken as the basis of the specific proposals to be put forward.National Labour Party.The final agenda for the 20th annual conference of the Labour Party, which will be held at Scarborough on June 22nd and the three following days, has been issued. One of the first items to be discussed will be a proposal by the National Executive that the affiliation fee for trade unions and other organisations be raised by 50 per cent, to 3d. per member. It is reported that a budget of prospective annual expenditure shows a total of  42,150. If the increased fee is decided on, the prospective income will be  43,750. Resolutions on international politics occupy a large place in the agenda. British action in Hungary and Russia is challenged by several resolutions; the Sheffield Trades and Labour Council proposing a motion recommending unions to instruct their members to refuse to do work which directly or indirectly assists hostilities against democratic socialist and Labour governments, and the B.S.P. demanding a special National Labour Conference for organis-ing a general strike to end the open and covert participation of the British Government in attacks on the Russian Soviet Republic.The Hampstead Labour Party motion that the party shall secede from the Second Inter-national has produced an amendment from the B.S.P. that application shall be made forth-with for affiliation to the Third International. Marylebone Labour Party is to move that the executive be instructed to participate in convening an international conference to which all labour and socialist bodies throughout the world, except those acting in definite alliance with capitalist political parties, shall be invited for the purpose of forming a real Inter-national. Messrs. Turner and Shaw, two members of the British Labour Delegation to Russia, are returning for the Conference and their reports may have considerable influence on this debate. It is understood that the rest of the delegation to Russia may have returned by the time the Conference opens. The delegation to Hungary has already returned.On Home affairs, resolutions range from conscription to housing, from direct action to the milk supply. There are many resolutions on the agenda in favour of self-determination for Ireland.The Parliamentary Labour Party is criticised in several resolutions. Hampstead, Reading and Wimbledon Labour Parties and the National Socialist Party propose that Labour M.P.&apos;s should be required on election to resign their trade union posts. Stoke Newington proposes that successful candidates should pledge themselves to resign if a two-thirds majority requires this, at a special meeting of the local party, but with a right to appeal to the national executive. Direct action is supported by a Marylebone resolu-tion, but is limited to .&quot; industrial purposes &quot; by the motion of the Balham and Tooting party. The B.S.P. urges local labour parties to adopt only candidates who pledge them-selves to use the political weapon as a means of more vigorously waging the revolutionary class struggle and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat.It will be perceived that nationalisation and direct action still appear as important issues, but there is little doubt that the greatest attention both in the Conference and in the country as a whole will be paid to (1) the International problems, and (2) the problems of labour representation in Parliament. On international matters the presence of British Labour delegations, which will by that time have returned from Russia and Hungary, will give a peculiar importance to the Conference. The two issues are (1) British policy and (2) the Socialist Internationals. British, policy in Russia and the Border States is still a source of much hostility to the Government in the local Labour parties and the Labour Party may be compelled after the Conference to adopt a more vigorous opposition. With regard to the Internationals, undoubtedly the more energetic minds in the Party are press-ing for closer connection with the Soviet Government under cover of adhesion to the Third
350251International. The actual phrases used are mere symbols for the struggle between the older parliamentary policy of the Labour Party and the newer tendencies towards revolu-tionary change in method.With regard to Labour representation in the House, the resolutions seem to indicate a division of opinion between the Parliamentary &quot;Labour Party, who are in the main trade unionists, and the local labour parties, which are increasingly groups of persons with poli-tical opinions opposed to those of the rank and file of the trade unions.Co-operative Congress.The Co-operative Congress concluded its annual conference on the 26th May. The principal decision of the conference was noted last week, namely, to hold over until next year the decision upon the proposal to set up a joint body representing the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress and the Co-operative Congress, to co-ordinate the political and electoral activities of these bodies. Resolutions were passed by the conference affirming the opposition of the co-operative movement to the recommendations of the Koyal Com-mission on Income Tax with reference to the taxation of co-operative profits and protesting against the proposed application of the new corporation tax to the surplus profits of co-operative societies.The co-operative movement is intimately concerned with the administrative activity of the Ministry of Food, and, in the past year, the movement as a whole has changed its attitude on the question of control and is now in favour of the earliest possible decontrol of articles of food. This movement was started by the directors of the wholesale societies, and has now reached its completion in a resolution of the Congress in favour of the abolition -tion of Government control over commodities at the earliest opportune moment. The Congress, however, decided in favour of a continuance of the Ministry of Food with powers to deal with weights and measures, quality tests, the publication of prices, and to watch the operations of trusts and combines.Building Guilds.The preliminary prospectus of the &quot; Guild of Builders (London), Ltd.,&quot; was published on the 27th May. The prospectus is, in fact, the proposal of the London District Council of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives for the establishment in London of a productive co-operative society controlled by operative builders for work on building schemes. &quot;Che definite adoption by the London Building Trade Operatives of the Building Guild scheme is the most important event in the history of this movement since the forma-tion of the Manchester Building Guild. The London proposal differs in points of detail from the Manchester proposal. The Manchester Guild is a limited company, while the London Guild is to be a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893-1913. The Manchester Guild was formed to take over contracts for the build-ing of houses under local authorities, but the London Guild takes power to work for every type of building owner whether public or private. The Manchester Guild insists on building on a prime cost plus percentage basis, while the London Guild is willing to take contracts at agreed inclusive prices. Like the Manchester proposal, however, the London Guild makes the first point of its programme the provision of full work or full maintenance for its operative members and, like it, too, it refuses to give a financial guarantee for the per-formance of its contracts. The governing body of the Guild will he a committee consist-ing of representatives of Trade Unions affiliated to the London District section of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives, representatives of other trade unions or societies of building trade workers, whether administrative, technical, clerical or opera-tive, subject to the approval of the committee, and representatives of such local committees as may be in existence. It is stated that Mr. Malcolm Sparkes is taking a leading part.in this London movement and is working in close association with the Trade Union leaders.Meanwhile, it is reported that the Manchester Guild is meeting with difficulties owing to the preference of the Ministry of Health for contracts at agreed prices over contracts the expense of which will fluctuate directly with the cost of labour and cost of material. As regards the attitude of Labour to these schemes generally, it may be observed that there is much confusion between these proposals and &quot; direct labour &quot; proposals, and in most parts of the country the Labour policy is to eliminate the private contractor by the establishment of municipal works departments employing direct labour. Building Guild schemes can only be expected to materialise successfully where local conditions are exceptionally favourable. Not the least of these conditions is the presence of local building trades officials gifted with enthusiasm, personality and foresight, and their co-operation with men like Mr. S. G. Hobson, at Manchester, and Mr. Malcolm Sparkes, in. London.i
252Joint Industrial Council for the Building Trades. The quarterly meeting of this council took place in Glasgow on the 20th and 21st May.  The council took into considera-tion the provisions of the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919, with reference to the restriction of so-called luxury building^  The discussion was interesting on account of the diverse views taken on the matter by Mr. W. Braclshaw, secretary of the Federation of Building Trades Operatives and of the operatives&apos; side of the council, and Mr. J. Armour, who represents on the council the United Operative Masons&apos; Association of Scotland.   Mr. Bradshaw contended that if indiscriminate building were permitted, a large number of men would be employed on so-called luxury building who had better be engaged on. housing schemes.   The Ministry of Health would be given an opportunity to urge further dilution, and Mr. Bradshaw insisted that the Trade Unions had accepted dilution up to the limit of their strength.  Mr. Armour, however, feared the immcdiate results of 1 lie operation of these restrictions.   If they were put into rigid operation now, lie thought that unemployment would be caused.   The time for severe restriction might come in, the future, but it had not yet arrived.   Mr. Armour complained that housing schemes at present provided for too many brick houses and did not provide for the proper use on housing schemes of stone-masons.   The council ultimately resolved to take no action on the matter.   The report of the Safety and Welfare Committee was presented, recommending a series of draft regula-tions for the prevention of accidents during building operations.   It was agreed that copies of the draft regulations should be sent to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and to the constituent bodies of the council for their consideration.   A report was presented from the Management and Costs Committee on the question of unemployment due to stress of weather.   The committee recognised that the loss of production owing to this cause varied with the nature of the operations performed, and affected differently the varying crafts. The problem therefore could only be effectively solved by spreading the incidence of the cost of providing for lost time of this character over the whole industry.    The main recommendations were that operatives should draw full pay when prevented from working through stress of weather, and that part of the cost of this should be carried separately by each employer and the remainder by all the employers in the industry collectively.   It was agreed to circulate this report among the constituent members and to resume consideration of it at the next meeting of the council.   It may be noted that the operatives&apos; desire is not only for the payment of time lost through stress of weather, but also for the payment of time lost through delays in the delivery of materials.The Sheffield Strike.The members of the National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers employed in the Sheffield heavy steel trade struck work on the 31st May against the introduction of the three 8-hour shift system for steam service men under award No. 84 of the Industrial Court. The men involved may be divided into two classes, &quot; set &quot; men, who are employed in actually manipulating the steel by rolling or forging, or are engaged on furnace work, and &quot; subsidiary &quot; classes, who are incidental to such work and who comprise boiler firemen, crane drivers, engine drivers, hammer and press drivers, gas producemen, &amp;c. These subsidiary classes are usually termed steam service men. The &quot; set &quot; men have always been shift workers and, in accordance with the Iron and Steel Trades agreements, they have been or should have been Avorking on a three eight-hour shift basis since January, 1919, in the case of furnace men, and since February, 1919, in the case of the other &quot;set.&quot; men. The difficulty with regard to the &quot; steam-service &quot; men is that prior to January 1st, 1919, they worked a 53-hour week and received the engineering trades code of overtime payment. On that date the 47-hour week in the engineering trades came into operation and wras applied to the &quot; steam service &quot; men. In order to carry out the Iron and Steel Trades agreement the employers desired to transfer these men from the 47-hour week basis to the three-shift system, in effect from engineering trade conditions to iron and steel trade conditions. Negotiations were complicated by the number of unions catering for steam service men, namely, the Winding and General Engineers&apos; Society, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, the National Union of General Workers, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the Workers&apos; Union, and the National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, &amp;c. The first three unions were parties to the reference to the Industrial Court which resulted in Award No. 84. The Court determined that these &quot; steam-service &quot; men should work on a three-shift basis and fixed shift rates. The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and the Workers&apos; Union have since agreed to the Award being put into operation ; and the first five unions in the above list now wish the award to operate immediately, in order that they may apply for a revision of the shift-rates.   The employers promised to do this on 30th May ; and the National
351253Amalgamated Union has immediately followed by a strike. Their reason for this action may be found in their determination to stick to engineering trades conditions ; and this difference of opinion with the other unions may result from the fact that the other unions cater for the semi-skilled or unskilled &quot; steam service&quot; men, while the skilled men are members of the National Union of Enginemen. Some 3.000 members of the enginemen&apos;s union are involved and it is estimated that the strike will affect some 25,000 other workers in the steel trade. The five unions which desire the award to be put into operation are indignant with the Enginemen&apos;s Union and are actively attempting to obtain public opinion on their side. Officers of the Ministry of Labour are in touch with the parties and if a suitable opportunity arises will intervene in the hope of terminating the strike.The National Union of General Workers.The annual conference of this union completed its session at Aberdeen on the 27th May. A resolution was passed in favour of a capital levy, and a resolution calling on officials of the union who were members of Parliament to resign their official positions in the union was unanimously rejected. It was decided to increase the number of Parlia-mentary candidates put forward by the union at the next General Election. Various pro-posals for a short working week, from 30 to 44 hours, were rejected in favour of a general decision not to lay down a definite number of hours in order that the union might be free to participate in any national agitation for any reduction of hours which may appear to have a reasonable chance of success.National Society of Brass Workers and Metal Mechanics.The 48th annual conference of this society has passed a resolution pledging the society to a definite policy for the elimination of female labour in the metal polishing trade. It was also decided that a national conference should be held in the near future to consider the position with reference to periodical reviews of wages, the 44-hour week, and the limita-tion of overtime. Further, it was resolved that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress should he asked to press for improved health conditions and washing facilities for the metal polishing trade.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.The ballot of the members of this Federation on the question of increased con-tributions to the M.F.G.B. has resulted in a majority against the proposed increases. A special conference of the Federation will be held in Cardiff on Saturday, June 5th, to consider the position. This conference will also formulate the S.W.M.F. proposals to be put before the national conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain which is to meet in the following week to consider questions put forward on wages demands as a result of the increase in coal prices. The refusal of the S.W.M.F. to pay increased contributions will not take effect until July 1st, on and after which date the increased contributions become due. It may therefore be judged that, apart from the other issues involved, on the M.F.G.B. conference on June .10th or 12th, may conceivably depend the continued affiliation of the S.W.M.F. to the M.F.G.B.National Union of Ex-Service Men.The first meeting of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Area Committee of this body met at Cardiff on the 31st May. Resolutions were passed instructing members to refuse mobilisation calls in connection with the &quot; present intervention in Russia,&quot; rejoicing at the &quot;failure of the scheme for recruiting the new Territorial Forces,&quot; calling upon the Government to withdraw the forces from Ireland, and condemning the employment of black troops on the Rhine. Mr. W. E. Mander, secretary of the union, presented a report on the International Ex-Service Men&apos;s Conference at Geneva, and stated that each unit of the International Conference had been instructed to call a general strike of all the workers in any country on a mobilisation for war. This union is receiving considerable support and sympathy from the Independent Labour Party.International Relations.International Labour Conference. The International Labour Conference is to hold its second session at Genoa on the 15th June. The agenda of this Conference was given in this Report, 19th May, p. 234. The conference will have before it the result of investigations already made by the International Labour Office and a programme drawn up at Antwerp last year at the International Seamen&apos;s Conference.  Delegates are actually expected at
254the Conference from the following 23 countries : Great Britain, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Czecho-Slovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Siam, Spain, Sweden and Venezuela. The delegation of Great Britain, including technical advisers and staff, will number about 22. The British official delegates will be : Sir Montague Barlow, Parlia-mentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, and Mr. Hipwood, Assistant Secretary, Marine Department of the Board of Trade. The British employers&apos; delegate will be Sir Alfred Booth, of the Cunard Steamship Company, and Mr. Havelock Wilson, M.P., Merchant Seamens&apos; League, will represent British seamen. It is reported that the questionnaire sent out by the International Labour Office has been answered by 14 States ; an im-portant statement from New Zealand has been received on the operation of the 8-hour day for seamen which may serve as a guide for some of the difficulties. Before the conference an unofficial meeting of international seamens unions will be held in the same place and there is a possibility that the American representative, Mr. E. T. H. Feruseth, will attend the conference. Although America cannot attend this conference officially, on account of the non-ratification of the Peace Treaty, the conference has complete power to arrange for the representation of American labour or maritime employers if the Americans wish it.International Federation of Trade Unions. The Bureau of the International Federa-tion of Trade Unions meeting in London on the 11th alt., decided to take steps towards putting into effect the resolution to boycott Hungary passed in March last. The official statement announces that information has been received showing that the present Hun-garian Government has been vindictively persecuting Communists and conniving at the unofficial murder of men who did not belong to the dominant race or who were suspected of holding opposing political views. The signatories to the communication are Messrs W. A. Appleton, President; L. Jouhaux and C. Mertens, Vice-Presidents; and J. Oudegeest and E. Fimmen, Secretaries. A circular letter has now been issued to all national centres to call the international boycott. It is expected that a definite date for the beginning of the boycott will be fixed next week.T. J.
