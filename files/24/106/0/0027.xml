CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,(11540.) Foreign Office!, j 3J&apos;i:&quot;i:^;;,,&apos;$s, Russia /081.RECENT TENDENCIES  IN SOVIET RUSSIA.THE final victory of the Red Armies over their various White opponents in January 1920 gave the impression abroad that the Soviet Government had consolidated its position in Russia and would remain master of the situation for a considerable time to come. The Red Army had occupied the richest districts of South Russia and Siberia and the resistance it had met with was insignificant. The first impression given by these victories was that the Soviet Government had finally established its claim to be an All-Russian Government and that Western Europe was bound to enter into relations with it as the only effective force in Russia. It was in this atmosphere that the decision was taken to re-establish commercial relations with Russia and it was in this atmosphere that the Border States Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Rumania - hastened to initiate peace negotiations with the Soviet Government.In spite of the apparent military and political strength of the Soviet Government, there is no doubt, that economically it is fundamentally weak. Even its political strength is more apparent than real, owing to the fact that the number of those who take any active part in politics in Russia is infinitesimal and the areas in which political life is of any importance are very restricted. The present absence of political opposition, therefore, may give quite a wrong impression of the real strength of the predominant political party. In a military sense also, the Red J^rmy has proved to be much weaker than seemed to be the case after the successive victories over the White Russian Armies. The victories over Kolchak and Denikin were achieved owing to the inherent rottenness and incompetence of the Siberian and Volunteer Armies which, once they began to retreat, became demoralised with extraordinary rapidity. Such victories, therefore, were little test of the real fighting qualities of the Red Army as against any reasonably well-disciplined and well-organised force.The real weakness of the Soviet Government, however, is economic. This they admit themselves and it is for this reason that they are making such desperate and such sincere attempts to restore commercial relations with the outside world. They know that if they are to save themselves it is a race against time, and, whatever misgivings men of commercial experience such as Krassin may have, they are desperately anxious to make an effort to improve economic conditions.The Bolshevik leaders are fully conscious of their own weakness, though they are sufficiently astute not to show it to the outside world. Their propaganda, which is just as strong as hitherto, endeavours to give the impression that not only are they masters of Russia both in a political and a military sense, but that even in economic matters the corner has been turned and that with outside help the prospects of the economic reconstruction of Russia are good. They have succeeded in creating an impression abroad that the restoration of economic relations is worth attempting and arrangements are now being made to establish a basis upon which they can be carried out.Side by side, however, with the tendency in favour of treating with the Soviet , Government as the only power able to deliver the supplies needed by Europe, there is another tendency which is asserting itself on the borders of Russia in favour of marking time and not making any rapid arrangements with the Soviets. This is due partly to a general feeling of scepticism about the real strength of the Soviet Government and partly to the impression which has been given in Poland, Finland and Rumania that the Allied Governments are disillusioned as to the prospects of getting large supplies out of Russia. It is important therefore to examine the reasons for this scepticism and to see how far it is justified.The victories of the Red Army were not an unmixed blessing to the Soviet Government. So long as the peasants distrusted the Whites for fear that they would take away the land from them and requisition their grain &quot;they were prepared to help the Reds either directly or indirectly. But once the fear of the Whites is removed their opposition is concentrated against the Reds who find themselves now in much the same position as the Whites in that they have to requisition the grain in order to feed[3241]
the cities. The Russian peasant is shrewd and cunning and has become thoroughly suspicious of any Central Government which, from his experience, has been the cause of most of his trouble. He is not likely to part with his grain in return for the promise that later on he will get the goods be needs. On the contrary, he is much more likely to sit tight where he is and to resist any interference from outside. For some time past this is what has been happening in those parts of Russia which contain the chief supplies of grain. In the south of Russia, the so-called Ukraine, the Bolshevik control has all along been much less firm than it is in the centre. Russians who have lived in hiding in Ukrainian villages have reported that each village is practically an armed camp forming a kind of independent republic where the peasants manage their own affairs and will brook no interference from outside. Occasionally they unite in armed bands, which enter the towns for plunder and kill as many Jews as they can find. There are many such bands of which the most famous is that led by Makhno. It was Makhno who disorganised Denikin&apos;s rear at the time of his advance on Moscow, and in spite of Denikins efforts it was found to be impossible to put an end to his activities. Makhno&apos;s forces melted away in the villages when they were pursued only to reappear when the White forces had been moved elsewhere. The same thing is happening in the rear of the Red Army in the Ukraine. There have been numerous revolts, and towns such as Ekaterinoslav and Kherson have for short intervals been held by them. These Green Armies are at large everywhere, and as they have the support of the local peasantryj it is impossible to round them up. General Wrangel asserts that he has come to an understanding with Makhno, as he considers that the Greens are more powerful in the south of Russia than the Reds. It is probably largely owing to the disorganisation caused by the Greens that the Poles have found it so easy to advance.Reports from Siberia point to the same tendency in Western Siberia. The Siberian peasant was so incensed with Kolchaks administration thai he preferred the prospect of the Reds to the continuance of the existing regime, but once the Reds arrived they, too, became unpopular. The Soviet authorities seem to have chosen their officials from Russians from Central Russia, whose object is to put the interests of Central Russia before those of Siberia. It is expected, therefore, that Green formations will put in an appearance in Siberia in the same way as they have in South Russia.The general tendency at present seems to be a weakening of the hold of the Soviets over South Russia and Siberia, however firmly they may hold the towns and the railway lines in Central Russia. The further the anarchy spreads on the fringes the more impossible becomes the position of the centre. Moreover, as the anarchy spreads transport becomes more difficult, and this impedes the efficiency of the Red Army, which, without proper transport, it will be difficult to keep together. If the Bolsheviks are to make anything of the work of economic reconstruction it is essential for them to keep control of Southern Russia and Siberia, for without these districts Central Russia must either die a slow death with the Bolsheviks still controlling the towns or must share the same fate as those parts of Russia where the country is under the control of different roving bands of peasants. The work of reconstruction from Moscow can only go forward slowly even with outside help, whereas the spread of peasant anarchy in the shape of Green Armies, may easily make rapid progress during the coming summer. In the latter case, the theory which is commonly held by the Poles, that Russia can only be restored by gradual stages through pushing commercial and other relations from the fringes, would become the only practical policy.May ,12,1920.
