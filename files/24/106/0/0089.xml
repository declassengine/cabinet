In view of the Conference to be held this afternoon, it is /kffbffg-circulated as an isolated document.(Sgd,)   M.P.A. HANKTY,Secretary, Cabinet., Whitehall Gardens, s.W. 3rd June, 1920.
ANNEX     &quot;A&quot;.0* nOn the question of the restoration of Trade and Economic Relations, two points of view are possible.    According to one, this restoration ought, to be postponed until all the disputes which had arisen between Soviet Russia and other countries in the last three years had been settled by diplomatic negotiations and a formal conclusion of a peace treaty.     On the other hand, it would soarcely be useful to defer the restoration of normal economic relations and to prolong the economic and food orisis which had broken out in europe as a result of the world war until such time as all controversial questions had been definitely and formally settled.     It would be more advantageous to begin the renewal of lirade and Economic relations at the earliest possible date, having previously settled only those disputes without the solution of which business relations were impossible.The questions of principle which must bo solved before trade and economic relations between two countries c6uld actually be-gin could be formulatod in the following manner A,   It is impossible to carry on commercial relations between two countries without commercial representations established by each country in the other country on the basis of reciprocity. Such commercial representations are absolutely necessary for the study of the market, the movement of prices, the selection of goods, intercourse with the sellers of such goods, comparison of individual -dual offers and estimates, the placing of orders, the conclusion, of agreements, the effecting of payments, the carrying out of technical examination and receiving of ordered goods, the despatch of goods by rail and ship, their insurance, and the transaction of various other business operations.   Commercial representations were equally needed to effect the sale of the goods which were the objects of export trade.   The persons forming such commercial representations must be granted freedom of sojourn and travel to other countries, personal inviolability and the right to export even without the grant of other privileges attached to diplomatic representatives.B.
v        0^0B. Commercial Representatives must have the right and the prao-tical facilities freely to communicate with their own and other countries &quot;by post, telegraph and wireless by means of cipher, with preferential rights over the correspondence of private persons.   Commercial Representatives must further have the right to send to, and receive from, Other countries courriers conveying parcels with business ocorrespondence, drawings, samples of goods, etcC. More or less regular trade and economic relations are im-possible without some legal basis*MR. BONAR LAW enquired exactly what this meant.MR. LLOYD GEORGE askecl whether it meant to convey power te take disputes into Court ?MR. ERASSIH explained that the work of commercial reuresenta-tions absolutely required that documents, passports, power of attorney, agreements, eto., signed, or confirmed by the official authorities of one country should be recognised as legally valid, in the other country, sinoe no transactions are possible with-out the fulfilment of this condition.   It is equally necessary to have the right to vindioate one!s interests in the Courts.M0HSI35UR KRASSIN continuing, said that, he was now approach-ing a most important point,   The Soviet Government were prepared immediately to renew trade relations with all countries, but it must be trade in the proper sense of the word, that is, an ex-change of equal, or approximately, equal values.   There could be no question of the transfer of property from one party to another without a proper equivalent.   That meant, that there must be a guarantee that the property and money of the Soviet Govern-ment, participating in that exchange of values, should be intact and free to circulate*   When Russia was buying looomotives in Great Britain, undertaking to pay for them a definite sum of money, it must be firmly established that that money when trans-ferred to some British Bank in Great Britain could not be at-tachod and&apos;would not be liable to confiscation in order to satisfyany
any former claim on Russia.   If such a guarantee be not given, the Soviet Government and the workers and peasants of Russia would understand that the time had not yet come for tha. restoration of trade relations.   Soviet Russia, he repeated, was anxious to trade with all the world, but she was not anxious and would not admit that Russian gold ana Russian raw materials should, on the pretext of trade relations with Russia, be pumped out of her for the payment of Russian State debts on which tho present Delegates refused to speak in connection with com-mercial negotiations, deferring the whole question to tho time of tho official negotiations on tho complete restoration of peace relations.   Such was the s^nso of his declaration about the necossity of safeguarding the. freedom of current financial and commercial operations against their being drawn into the field of problems and claims which belonged to the domain of future Peace Treaty, .
AiJJiEX B.There was very little hope that the seller of loco-motives should need precisely that very raw material which could be exported from Russia at the moment. Hence it was necessary at any rate to make up at least part of the difference by the payment of money, that is, gold.   For that reason the question about the possi bility and the conditions of selling gold was of an immediate practical interest.   If the condition of the realisation of gold be its sale at a compulsory price entailing a loss of from 26 to 28?:, the Soviet Govern-ment would of course refuse such a disadvantageous tran transaction, and would defer the renewal of trade relations until such time as Russian gold could be sold at its proper price.
