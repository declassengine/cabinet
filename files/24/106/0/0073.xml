CREATION OF /. W- r DEPAKTi\i!,!NT FOR MIDDLE     EASTERN ADKIHISTKATION.Dear ?rirae ItLrvVAx: ;vWe the undersigned members of Parliament and others interested in the Middle Rast respectfully ask you whether you would be willing; to receive us at any time convenient to yourself in order that we may lay before you our carefully considered views on the question of the formation of a new ministry and department for the control and direction of British responsibilities in the Middle Fast,Me feel that the present arrangement whereby Mesopotamia, Central and Southern Arabia, and Aden are under the control and direction of the India Office, while T,1gypt, Palestine, the Soudan and relations with the Sherifial family of Mecca are under the Foreign Office, and Cyprus and British Somaliland are under the Colonial Office, has resulted and will, if it is allowed to continue, result in conflicts of policy, misunderstandings, delays and avoidable expense.Further we feel that no one of these three existing departments is qualified either in organisation or personnel to discharge the new and onerous tasks with which we are confronted not only by the assumption of Trusteeship under the League of Nations for the new states of Mesopotamia and Palestine but also by the necessity of initiating a new policy in Egypt and in our future relations with the various independ-ent or serai-independent States in the Middle Eastern Area,In our opinion the application of Indian Methods and Imposition of India Office control in Mesopotamia can only result in the creation of serious political embarrassment in the whole Arabic-speaking world and in the establishment&apos;  &apos; of a/
6 o of o. system so expensive in men and money that sooner or later the British Parliament will become restive.    Further, to the India Office, Arabia and Mesopotamia with their comparatively small population, uill see&quot;- to be an almost insignificant &quot;slue show&quot; when compared with the gigantic task with which it is confronted in the Indian Empire itself.Similarly the administration of Middle Eastern Countries on a basis consistent with our declarations to the Arabs and others, and with our acceptance of the con-ditions implied in the mandatory article of the covenant of the League of Nations is not a task of which t^e Foreign Office is well fitted to take charge.    The methods and traditions of diplomacy which necessarily and rightly are dominant in the Foreign Office do not fit in harmoniously with the supervision and control of administration.     In this connection we cannot refrain fromexpressing the opinion that, had an office better&apos; equipped than the Foreign Office for dealing with administrative and internal political problems been in charge of egypt, many of the lamentable difficulties which have arisen in that country during the last six years might have been avoided,Above all, the new task before us requires an Arabic-speaking civil service, self-contained and inspired by the new. spirit which is now so much required in dealing with Eastern peoples.     Unless this service has a &quot;father&quot; as well as &quot;master&quot; of its own it will be difficult to create or to maintain.So far from thinking that the creation of a new Ministry and Department would involve any further serious charge upon the British taxpayer, we feel that, as policy governs expenditure, the. only way to ensure that our new commitments in the Middle &quot;ast will not involve a large and possibly increasing financial burden lies in the&apos;  &apos; constant/
constant pursuit of a nrogrossivo policy.     Our aim should he to discharge our responsibilities with the minimum garrisons and the minimum British personnel, and to seek to bring about the r--.a7.minimun possible development of Native administra---tion and self-dependence*     Such an achievement can, in our opinion, only be arrived at by the constant vigilance and sympathy of a separate Minister and servicet and. by cutting dorm the present costly methods of administration.If His Majesty1s Government can see their way to establish this new ministry forthwith ve beg to assure you that any influence we can bring to bear in Parliament and in the press to support such a proposal will be forthcoming unreservedly and energetically.?.re feel that while wo could elaborate many further arguments in support of our contention such elaboration would be more suited to oral treatment rather than by the submission of any moro lengthy memorandum, and that is why wo seek an early opportunity of an interview before raising the question in Parliament* &apos;
