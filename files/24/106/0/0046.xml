KEMPS J 3j.j&quot;m&apos; B&apos;  &apos;K&amp; FOOD 003UO?ROI-IQR.(1)       I have read the two memoranda, one by Sir Laming Worthington 3 vans (CP.1253) and the other by The Home Secretary, (C.P.1294).     I agree with the views expressed by The Home Secretary.(2)        I agree that it is necessary to have one generalissimo responsible for, and for co-ordinating, the various services which it is essential to keep going during a national emeiogoncy, but it is I think equally essential, having regard to the technical and diverse nature of many of such services, e,,g* - food supplies and distribution, electricity supplies, etc, that each of the depart-ments concerned should themselves,be responsible for maintaining the several services which come within their normal duties.   I conceive it would be a difficult&apos; matter for a Department, other than The Ministry of Food, to maintain the supply and distribution of food-stuffs in an emergency without-a serious amount of over-lapping and consequent loss in efficiency.(3)       During the Railway Strike in September of last year the arrangements for the supply,, distribution and tr an snort by road of food-stuffs were, both ostensibly raid in fact, made by the Minis-try of Food, which in the eyes of the public took no sides in the dispute, but confined itself to being, as it were, a trustee for the community, and distributed food-stuffs generally without dis-orimination to strikers, end non-strikers.    Furthermore, the local organisation of the Ministry being of a democratic character, obtained, in a groat ,any instances, the actual assistance of strikers and their sympathisers in the duties.it had to perform.&apos; If the responsibility for the supply and distribution of food-stuffs was removed from&apos;this -Department -and: placed under a department responsible/
responsible generally for linking all arrangements necessary to moot a r strike I have grave doubts whether suoh a department,.dealing as it would have to, with a variety of essential services,. (S.O.-protection, gas,. electricity and railway, services) would enjoy the same immunity, and general sympathy in its attempts, to. maintain tho supply and-die-tri button- of food-stuffs..0.
