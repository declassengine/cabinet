I II$fcuHSftT IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAITHIC KAJIHSTY&apos;S GOVERNS NT.)CRET. COPY ITO. .CABIKST,P, 1394.RESUMPTION OF TRAPS &apos;7ITH RUSSIA * RUSSIAN GOLD.Koto &quot;by tho Chancellor of the 73xchequer covering Homorandunhy Itr&quot;;&quot;&quot;&apos;B* P.&quot; BJackott7I circulate a Note by the Controller of Finance on this subject.     It seems to mo both wrong and impracticable to make this gold tho basis of trade with Rufesia.(Initialled)   A. C.Treasury, S/-V.1. 2nd June, 1920,Memorandum by Hr. B. P, Blackett.With reference to CP. 1349, 1342 and 1369 on the resump-tion of trade with Russia, the proposal that Russian geld should be imported into this country direct or from esthonia or should be used as the basis of credits in this country, raises somewhat complicated questions, and I wish to sot forth briefly the main considerations regarding tha matter from the point of view of the financial situation in this country.The chief difficulty in the matter lies in tho fact that M. Krassin and his colleagues cannot show an absolutely secure title to this gold.     There can bo no doubt that looking at tho matter broadly it represents stolen property so long as tho Bolshevik Govern-Eiont is unrecognised.     It is not certain whether or not tho creditors of Russia in this country could effectively embargo such gold or obtain an injunction from the Courts to prevent it being dealt with.     But it is known that many of the nosu important people in the City have been advised that such proceedings might be successful, and that tho moment any Russian gold arrives, they will attempt to establish thoir claim to it.   The Bank of England is a large holder of frozen Russian Bills (as agent for.the British
3 n a- p- Ohj&quot;Government) and it would-be bound to protect its interests (andours) by following suit as soon as other creditor3 tried toembargo the gold.     It follows that such - gold cannot properly be made the oasis of credits in the same way an gold to which an absolutely good title can be shown;   and what is of more immediateimportance, it follows that tho Bank, of England will refuse toaccept and pay for such 30&apos;ld.     It is however an- essential part ofthe gold policy which we have adopted, that all gold should for thepresent at any rate be sold to the Bank of England.     The surplus-  &apos; toSold of the Joint Stock Banks has now been handed ovor/thoBank cf England in accordance with this policy.    In short, we feel bound to discourage M. Krassin from making payment or obtainingcredit with this gold, until he can show an absolutely safe title to it and until it can safely ba taken by the Ban!-: of England.It should be explained that the nronosal in naragranh 1 of CP. 134-9 that the gold might be located in a neutral state and credits opened in respect of it in this country, is open to just as strong financial objections as tho import of gold into&apos;&quot; this country.     Under this scheme banks would open credits against gold abroad, which we deprecate in any.case, and in particular when it is gold which could not safely be brought to this country.As regards the machinery by means of which w^ can discourage the use of this gold, although the import of gold is not in any way restricted, we have two effective weapons:-1. . few prudent bankers will accept Russian gold without some form of indemnity or promise of support from us.2,     the gold cannot be re-exported without licence so that, its price is the home price of 8^&apos;s. a fine ounce instead of tho world price of 106s.
0 0 ftIf this main objection cannot be over come--(-and the only obvious way to overcome it is to grant de facto recog-nition to the Bolshevik Government in some form or other) there remains the further difficulty that the Treasury and the Bank of England are strongly opposed to granting re-export licences to casual imports of gold.   Contracts have been made with South and West Africa and the Congo for the shipment to this country of the whole of their outfjut, and any decision to grant re-export licences for casual imports of gold would go far to influence the producers to terminate these . contracts,   in addition, it would be almost impossible to exercise effective control over &quot;casual&quot; gold exported under licence.Gold anywhere in Northern Europe finds extraordinary physical difficulty in getting away except to or through London, so that the refusal of an export licence is a very effective weapon.   The Governor of the Bank holds that if we continue to refuse casual licences for export   the gold must ultimately come here at the Mint price (B5s, per fine oz.).   If other difficulties are disposed of some arrangement must doubtless be made to meet the difficulty as to export licences,   proba-bly the most advantageous would be to insist on the gold being sold to the British Government at a price somewhere between the Mint price and the market price, and if we so choose we are probably in a position to dictate the price.But it is obvious that until the legal title of the Bolshevik Government is established beyond doubt, no one i3 safe in dealing with the gold at all. , ..&apos;(intld.)   3.P.3,I Treasury, g.w..3rd Juno-  192n.   &apos;
