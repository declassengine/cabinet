AHOUR?, OF ?I^L(WMKNT BILL.&apos;::emoranrtum by &quot;the Minister of Labour(.(1)   Sir Robert Home Introduced last Session a Bill-to Regulate the Hours of Employment4   This Bill &apos;.*as pre-nared in conjunction ^ith a Provisional Joint Committee appointed by the National Industrial Conference and Fas designed to carry out the recommendations of the Provisional Joint Committee1s Report on the subject of a 48 hour week. Further consideration has been   iven to the matter and a fresh draft Bill (co^y attached)   has been prepared.(?,)   After the introduction of the Pill last Fes si on It was criticised by the Provisional joint Committee on the grounds that it excluded agriculture, seamen and police, and that in certain other respects it did not conform exactly to the Committee1s Report..(3)   As a result of the decision of the Conference of Ministers on 9th February last (to the effect that the question of including agriculture In the Hours of Fmployment Bill should be left to the decision of the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary for Scotland) the matter has been discussed and the general conditions under vrhioh agriculture should be Included in the Rill - if the Government should decide to Include it - have been agreed,&apos;Conferences -*ith the agricultural interest, a have also takers pDiace, and as a result.a separate part of the Pill has been prepared, -&quot;hereby agriculture Is brought within the Bill, subiect to adequate safeguards.   The National Farmers1 Union, in discussing the question with Fir Robert Home, opposed the principle of the application of the Bill to a^rlu&amp;ture, but said that if, notFlthstand^r\p, their protests, the Government decided thnt the Bill should be. so applied, procedure such &apos;   - &apos; as/ ::&apos;f
A 0 Soas is outlined in the proposed new Classes wmild &quot;bo the irwst satisfactory in the circumstances.The genera] effect of the clauses now proposed is to place sericulture &quot;Hthin the Bill, but the Minister of Agriculture is to make orders (on the advice of the Agricultural Wages Board set up under the Corn Production Act) determining the length of the statutory week, which may vary from district to district and from period to period during the year, and freedom is allowed to the farmer to make an individual contract with his men as to the length of overtime to be worked from time to time, providing that the appropriate rates for such overtime (as settled by an order of the Minister of Agriculture on the advice of the Agricultural Wages Board) are paid.   Provision is made also for the exclusion of particular classes of agricultural labourers.(4) The Minister -for Agriculture and the Secretary for Scotland have considered the Clauses and I am in consultation with them in regard to the precise wording.   The present draft*(Clause 7) unduly restricts the powers of the Minister of Agriculture, making him merely the mouthpiece of another body; this raises the question of the constitutional position of a Minister of the Crown,   I am consulting my two colleagues on the point and hope to be able to arrive at an Agreed form of wording. Subject to this, I recommend that the principle of the Bill   be annlied to agriculture on the lines suggested.(5)   Since the introduction of the Bill last Session, the International Labour Convention on the Hours of Employment has been prepared and under the Peace Treaty must be ratified or rejected by the signatory Governments.(6)   The Convention differs from the present Bill in that it fixes an ft hour day as well as a 48 hour week; that it applies to industrial undertakings only and not to all employed personsj that it includes railways, and that it applies the principle of a 48 hour r?eek to seamen (leaving over howe^r, to a special conference/
conference, to be held at Genoa In June next, the consideration of&quot;the application of the principle)0(7)   It is important for the sake of International Labour Legislation that the Britiah- Government should ratify the Convention,, and the original Bill has accordingly been amended to bring it into conformity as far as possible -rith     v the International Convention.   Difficulties, however, still exist in regard to the position of railwaymen and seamen,(8)   In the case of railwaymen there are the following difficulties:-(a) There are In force agreements (arrived at as a result of negotiations in which the Government took part) ^hich establish an B hour day, but in addition they provide for (1) a &quot;guaranteed week&quot; Of 48 hours and (2) that any work done on Sunday is to be regarded as overtime, irrespective of the number of hours otherwise worked In the week.   The principles of these agreements are Inconsistent with thoseof the Washington Convention and, of course, In so far as they admit regular Sunday work, they are not in accordance with the views of Labour as a wholej owing to the &quot;guaranteed week&quot; the arrangements are exceptionally favourable for the men and they would not be likely to agree that they should be modified.(b) Under present circumstances, and probably for someyears to come, some amount of systematic overtime on the partof many grades of railwaymen Is inevitable, Whereas theWashington Convention in effect prohibits overtime except in andexceptional /temporary circumstances,(c) Some amount of non-systematic overtime, the extent of which cannot be foreseen, Is Inseparable from Railway working; additional traffic due to differing causes, not necessarily covered by &quot;break-downs&quot;, has to be handled forthwith irrespective, of the normal hours of working.3, (9) The/
(9)   The representatives of the two Railwayman&apos;s Unions ask that Railways shall be excluded from the Bill; the Railway Managers also seek exclusion - and the Ministry of Transport colour in this view.   On the other hand, if so important a body, as the railwaymen are excluded from the Bill, Great Britain cannot be said to have complied, with the Vrrshington Convention,(10). The Bill empowerfl the Minister of Labour to make Orders exempting from the operation of any or all of the provisions of the Act any class of employment, and the terms of the Bill therefore make it practicable to leave railwaymen in the Bill and to make an exempting Order afterwards; such an Order, if based on the existing   48 hours agreement for railways, would, however, be an awkward precedent for the Ministry ofrLabour in pealing with other trades.   Moreover such a course, while on the face of it seeming to amount to &quot;ratification&quot;, would in fact he- nothing of the kind,(11)   I have considered whether it is practicable to leave Railwaymen in the Bill and subsequently to exclude them from the restricting features of the Act, utilising the &quot;exceptions&quot; ^nich ^re provided for in various clauses of the &quot;Washington Convention, and there have been consultations on this point with some of the delegates and advisers rrho attended the Washington Conference.So far as regards the non-systematic - overtime ((c) above) Article 6 of the Washington Convention (temporary exceptions to deal &quot;1th exceptional cases of pressure of work), combined with Article 3 (accident, &quot;force majeure&quot; etc), can probably be said to ^ive sufficient elasticityThe other difficulties, however, (the systematic weekday overtime and the acknowledged Sunday work in excess of ther4B hours) seem to fall quite outside the terms of the convention and/
and it seems to be the general opinion of those whom I have consulted (including those present at Washington) that the Railwayman&apos;s agreements -cannot be brought within the scope of the Conventionc[IP.)   On the whole, therefore, it appears to be necessary to exclude Railwaymen from the Bill; this means that in ratifying the Hours of Labour Convention the British Govern-ment would make reservations so far as regards Railwaymem(1(3)   As regards seamen, the menT s Unions are. pressing for the immediate inclusion of seamen in the Pill,   The peculiar conditions or the industry and the difficulties connected -,rith manning and. accommodation in the Mercantile Marine, raise questions of   great difficulty.   In conjunction with the President of the Board of Trade, however, I have suggested the   introduction of a short Bill giving the Board of Trade power to make   regulations with regard to manning, hours of employment, etc, at sea, these regulations to be framed with the assistance of the National Maritime Board, That Board is considering the claim for a 48 hour week at the moment, and it is honed that it will be in a position to report in time for the International Conference at Genoa in June which i&apos;- to give further consideration to the question of the 48 hour week at sea,(14)   The Seamen&apos;s Unions will probably press for the inclusion in the Hours of Employment Bill (and not in a special Bill) of -whatever conclusions may be arrived at as a result of the Genoa Conference, so that thev rnav be included, with the reat of industry and, like other trades, be under the iurisdiction of the Ministry of Labour,   It is the case, however, that the regulation of seamen s Hours is only a part of the general regulations of their conditions of employment, and it may be held, to be impracticable to separate hours from the general administration of the Merchant Feamen1 s Acts,
(15)   The Bill nr drafted does not apnly to Ireland, The view taken has been that the Bill should be introduced In this form, the roint being left for discussion in Parliament,(16)     The Pill that was presented to the House of Commons last Session was practically an agreed Bill, settled after discussion with the Provisional Joint Committee appointed by the National Industrial Conference of Employers and Employedj   I think it is advisable that as soon as it has obtained the approval of the Cabinet the new Pill should be sho^n to this Joint Committee and T should propose to do this before formally introducing the Bill.(17)    The decision of the Cabinet is required on the rollow ing n o i nt s:-(a) Should the Hours of Employment Bill be extended toinclude Agriculture, subject to the special safeguards sot forth in Part II of the Pill.(b) Should Railwaymen be excluded, from the Rill,notwithstanding the provisions of the v&apos;ashins:ton Convention.(c) Should Seamen be excluded from the Bill, on theunderstanding that, subject to what may transpjre at the Genoa. Conference, the hours of Seamen will be dealt &quot;*ith by a spec j al Rill at a later date.(Signed)    T. J.KAC5&apos;TM?AP.A,Ministry of Labour, 20/5/20.
