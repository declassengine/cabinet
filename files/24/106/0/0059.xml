Most of the decrease occurred in cereals, and the imports of dairy products were also small; on the other hand, there was a considerable increase in the arrivals of sugar. Except for sugar, coffee, and cocoa, stocks of food-stuffs declined during the month, but were generally satisfactory, except perhaps in the case of cheese.The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour as on May 1st, show a con-siderable increase in the average retail food prices, the percentage increase since July, 1914, rising from 135*2 on April 1st to 14(i&apos; 2 on May 1st. Further seasonal decreases in milk, eggs and fish, were heavily outweighed by the advance in bread and flour, the larger seasonal increase in potatoes, and an upward tendency in bacon and cheese prices.Table A.
