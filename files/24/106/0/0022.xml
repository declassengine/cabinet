CP. 1521(P 3938)His Brltan.From Viceroy, ISth May 1920. (Received 19th, 12.55 p.m.)Priority.621 S. Secret. Mussoorie Conference. Following telegram from Dobbs, No. 46 S., 17th May, is repeated for information : &quot; Tarsi has sent me two letters to-day-first, saying as frontier incidents are now satisfactorily adjusted, he expects a reply about his original request that we shall suspend Waziristan operations ; second, saying that Turkish settlement now announced bears appearance of being conceived in spirit of religious bigotry against Islam and asking for explanation of our policy. I have replied to his first letter that frontier incidents cannot be held to be satisfactorily adjusted, until all Afghan forces are actually withdrawn to Afghan side of frontier, which has not yet taken place. I cannot therefore yet reply officially to any of his questions. I shall send no reply to his second letter, but shall give him informally Persian translation, which I have had prepared, of official announcement regarding Turkish terms. Afghan Delegation are reported to be much depressed over Turkish terms. I have reason to believe that fresh instructions from Amir insist(ing) that Tarsi shall get written reply from me about suspension of Waziristan operations, and that he shall watch carefully Indian developments regarding the Turkish question, and conform his attitude to theirs.&quot;
