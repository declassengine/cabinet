THE CABINET.NEGOTIATIONS WITH RUSSIAN CO-OPERATIVEORGANIZATIONS.MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, the notes of a meeting held at Copenhagen between Allied Representatives and Delegates of the Russian Co-operative Organizations.W. S. C.The War Office,19th May, 1920.The Russian Delegates were : MM. Krassin, Litvinoff, Nogin, Rozovsky, Klishko and M. Berkenheim, who attended the first session only,First Session, 7th April, 1920. After introductions had taken place, discussions began between Mr. Wise and M. Krassin as to Litvinoffs inclusion in the Delegation to visit London. Mr. Wise stated that the decision not to allow Litvinoff to visit London was final and Krassin pretended to tear the breakdown of the negotiations in consequence, and, as an alternative, suggested another meeting place instead of London. This was not agreed to.Speaking of economic conditions of Russia, Krassin stated : (a.) Before the war Europe had been dependent on many supplies from Russia. (b.) The Russian transport was wholly employed on military duties, therefore warmust stop before trade could commence, (c.) Large quantities of grain and raw materials would be available as soon as warstopped and railways were released. (d.) If the Allies were serious they would aid Russia financially.In response to a question, Krassin stated that many thousands of locomotives were needed, each of which could transport grain. They were prepared to pay for them wholly or partly in gold. Krassin stated that at end of March, 1920, 60 per cent, of engines were out of commission, but that they would reduce this figure shortly. In the last 18 months they had repaired 5,000 versts of railway and 2,500 damaged bridges. Krassin undertook that any supplied locomotives would only be used on trade work in supply areas, and he thought that Poland would shortly make peace, and the question of using material for military purposes would not arise. Krassin could give no figures of probable exports; everything depended on transport.Krassin stated that there were now no private traders in Russia, everything belonged to the State, who bought and sold. Litvinoff refused to discuss Russian Government attitude towards property of allied and neutral citizens in Russia and wished the matter left pending.Krassin added that it was essential for resumption of trade that the Russian Government be recognized as owner of all property in Russia.Second Meeting, 8th April, 1920. A further attempt to substitute another city for London was rejected by Mr. Wise, backed up by the French representative. Italy was suggested and Mr. Wise pointed out the Italian Governments objections. Mr. Wise turned the tables on Krassin by stating that if Russians desired trade they would agree to London/as it was the Headquarters of S.E.C., and the place where greatest speed would result.   This was supported by Mr. 0&apos;Malley of the Foreign(B20/239)   100  5/20  H&amp;S. 8285wo
2Office, and it was further pointed out by Mr. Wise that Kussia was the chief loser if negotiations failed.   Krassin stated that there were questions he must raise (1.) Cessation of a state of war in so far as it affected trade relations. (2.) Eaising the blockade.(3.) Ee-opening of trade relations with Allied or neutral countries. Litvinoff raised the point of Black Sea bombardments.Wise replied that (1) and (2) went in sequence, and that there would be no repe-tition of the hostile incidents in the Black Sea once negotiations were under way. He also stated that (3) would not arise if trade was carried on through the Co-operatives, to which Krassin stated that the Bussian Government would agree to this provided Allies safeguarded Co-operatives&apos; interests outside Kussia.Third Meeting, 9th April, 1920. Krassin stated that Moscow was attempting to arrange for a city other than London. Mr. Wise replied that in that case the affair was hung up until a reply was received from Moscow. .M. Krassin wished to continue the discussion as to means of trade, and spent some time in discussion of the difficulties which would arise by trading with the Centrosoyus and not the Soviet Government direct. Mr. Wise said that all trade questions must be settled in London by experts on both sides. He emphasized the fact that the delegation was welcome in London without Litvinoff.
