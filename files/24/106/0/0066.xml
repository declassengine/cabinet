TLLEGRAM from the Governor General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 20th May (Received Colonial Office 2.0 pan. 20th May 1920)Prime Minister feels considerable anxiety regarding prospects of New Zealand frozen meat trade and has asked me to make further urgent representations to you on the matter as no reply has yet been received to my telegrams of March 22nd April 9th and May 5bh.   Since despatch of first mentioned telegram it has become increasingly evident that great financial difficulty must arise when new season opens unless fully adequate arrangements areimade for relief.    Owing to serious delays  in arrival of refrigerated steamers New Zealand stores are now filled to their utmost capacity in consequence of &quot;which a large quantity of stock which under ordinary conditions would have been slaughtered before June 30th would have to be dealt with after that date*   It will thus be seen that an extension of the Imperial purchase to December at least is a matter of vital necessity to this country.  Emphasis is also laid on the fact that even under the best shipping arrangements that could be hoped for heavy stocks of meat owned by Imperial Government must necessarily remain in store in the Dominion and in the United Kingdom when the new season opens and in due course be market in conjunction with such free meat as oan be shipped.  This combined with the delay which must arise in shipping the new seasons free meat will depreciate market values forlive
9J Qlive stock in the Dominion and for frozen meat to such an extent as to create serious financial difficulties for producers*    It is evident that only the provision of the greatest amount refrigerated tonnage possibly available and any extension of Government purchase can enable position to be met *  A representative meeting of producers is to be held on May 27th and a roply before that date is greatly desired.    It is earnestly hoped that you will do all you can to impress His Majesty!s Government with the seriousness of the position with which Dominion is faoed and of the necessity of affording relief indicated *LIVERPOOL.&apos;fi
6 k UPARAPHRASE TELEGRAM. From the Secretary of State fir the Colonies to the Governor General of New Zealand. (Sent 3.8 p.m. 26th May, 1920).Urgent  Clear the line.Referring to your telegrams of 10th March, 22nd Ifcoh, 9th April, 5th May ai:.d 20th May. as to Meat, His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that answer has been delayed but they felt bound carefully to re-examine whole situation in view of further representations of New Zealand Government.Mount of mutton and lamb under control of His Majesty1s Government already excessive so that dis-posal presents great difficulty.   Every effort is being made to deal with the abnormal situation.   No ships now waiting discharge here through lack of storage accommoda-tion and a substantial reduction in prices has effected increase in consumption while every effort is being made to reduce the congestion by sales on Continent, even if they have to be made on credit.   There is in spite of all this no reasonable prospect that consumption here can overtake supply and every probability that until well into 1921 United Kingdom market will continue over1 supplied.  His Majesty&apos;s Government reluctant therefore to increase their commitments by any purchases in respect of 1920/1921 Season which would only increase difficulties in dealing with existing supplies.Further doubtful whether it would assist in direction desired if His Majesty&apos;s Government purchased remainder of current season&apos;s production in New Zealandwhich
which has not passed through Works by 30th June 1920, purchase would only increase difficulty likely to be experienced in conducting new season&apos;s operations by increasing quantity which will have to be transported from New Zealand and disposed of on United Kingdom market before there is a clear field for normal tradi; operations.His Majesty&apos;s (roverament for these reasons do not see their way to depart from decision in my telegram 13th March.MILNER.
