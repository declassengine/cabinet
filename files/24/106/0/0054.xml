The Commandor-ln-chief, &quot;Western Approaches , represents that aimed Revolutionaries are attaoking and burning Coastguard Statiora which, hitherto, has not ouused loss of life to the men of the C.G. Service , their wives and ohildren.This immunity from death or wounds may not continue,,Commarder-ln-Chief represents that both the Civil and Military Authorities are powerless to protect any but a few OpGpStationsUnder these circumstances he recommends that a force of Marines should bo utilised and distributed amongst those which Military oannot protectsThe number of Marines whioh could be utilised for the purpose is about 800, the majority of whom are very young and only partially trained.    They have no transport0The service on whioh they would be employed would necessitate their being divided up into small detachments of 10 N.C.0.S and men.This form of service for men who are very young and lack training is considered to be most undesirable.The Navy being essentially a sea force, it has always been understood in the past that if the Civil Power is unable effectively to protect Naval property on shore, the assistance to the Civil Power in doing so would be furnished by the Army.   It is a considerable departure, therefore, from policy for the Navy to provide a force for dealing with a situation requiring armed intervention on shore, even to the extent of defending ITaval property against organised attack, and the Admiralty are of opinion that the Havy should not be called .upon to do so unless it is absolutely unavoidable.If, however, the situation is as stated by the Commander-in-Ghief, life stern Approaches, The Admiralty must at onco take the best steps -that they can to conserve Naval lives, property a,nd interests by ordering the evacuation of certain C.G* Stations -which would thus be practically given over for destruction tothe Revolutionaries - (the interference with Customs and life caving services being apospted) and by concentrating tho forces at our disposal to defend efficiently those stations which are of major importance , thus avoiding dispersion of a large number of weak forces which would invite disaster,   The defenders of these stations are being informed that they are entitled to use force to repel force even to the extent of firing on armed assailants.Attached is a copy of a Telegram sent today to the Commandor-in-chief, Western, approaches, in reply to his application.(Signed) Beatty.(for First Lord, absent). 27.5,1920.
