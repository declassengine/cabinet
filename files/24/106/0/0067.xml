&quot;TELEGRAM.-.From-the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 21st May. (Received Colonial Office 8.40 a,m, 22nd May, 1920.)Following from Prime Minister begins:   Large Conference representing whole meat industry waited on me to-day with reference to alarming effects on the meat industry of Australia by the congestion of meat stocks in Britain and desired me to urge on British Government necessity for clear-ing up accumulated stocks of meat in Great Britain at earliest possible date to prevent irreparable damage being done to the producers of the Commonwealth and to the reputation of Australian meat.At the time of despatch of my telegram 19th April producers were not aware of the vast accumulation of stocks. In view of the fact that this accumulation of meat stocks has practically closed the market for further supplies the Conference strongly urges British Government to continue present meat contracts until say the end of the year.This will be acceptable to producers and ensure stability of the industry until such time as normal con-^ ditions of trade prevail particularly with regard to shipping and general market conditions.   It will also obviate pobsi1-bility of competition in British market with large stocks already in hands of British Government and which must be cleared off before normal avenues of trade can be resumed. This is most essential from point of view of British Government and Australian producers.   I therefore urge continuance of contracts will end of the year.  Ends.FERGUSON.
9 o 9K* ,U yjPARAPHRASE TELEGRAM. From the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia.(Sent 3.40 p.m. 26th May, 1920.)Referring to your telegram of 21st May as to Meat, His Majesty&apos;s Government as indicated my telegram 19th May, provided that assent of various States can be obtained, would have no objection to and would indeed prefer substitution of definite date for termination of meat contracts in place of uncertainty of date under existing contracts.   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that while such date should be fixed to permit inclusion of current season&apos;s output in contracts any portion of output of next season should be excluded.   Assumed that 30th September 1920 would permit sufficient margin of time to all Southern States for this purpose.   In case of Queensland His Majesty&apos;s Government in view of special circumstances suggest 30th November seje my telegram of &apos;19th May.  Are above arrangements -acceptable^&apos; Should be glad of reply^by-&apos;telegraph as soon as possible.MILNER.
