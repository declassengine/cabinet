Of] 0 O U d. I.Treasury Chambers, .  &quot;Whitehall, s.W. 1.21st May, 1920.Dear Mr. Rathbone,The cabinet has this morning ^iven prolonged and careful consideration to the. proposals which have been discussed between U3 for the treatment of British indebtedness to the American Government and the parallel treatment by both the United States and Great Britain of the debts due to them by France, Italy and ether Allied Governments.Since I had my last meeting with you the discussion between the prime Ministers of France and G.veat Britain at lynipne have on the initiative of the French resulted in an agreement that in order to provide a solution for the economic difficulties which are gravely weighing upon the general situation of the world and in order to mark a definite beginning of the era of Peace the settlement of the debts between them and between them and the other European Allies should proceed on parallel lines with that of T,he Repartition debts of the Central Empires,The question of jjuropean indebtedness to America was not discussed at-this conference at which no American representative was present, but before proceeding further with the considera-tion of detailed proposals for the treatment of the British debt to the United States Government which as explained by you were intended to form the basis for similar arrangements between the United states and Great Britain on the one hand and the Allied nations indebted to both of them on the other, we feel that their applicability to the general, situation must be further explored and that it raises questions of great impor-tance unsuited for departmental treatment between our two Treasuries,   piscussiona on the subject took place at an earlier
9 0 ,9stage between president 7/ilaon and the Primsl&amp;nister and the^united prime Minister proposes now to resume these discussions and will send a communication on this subject for the president1 s con-si deration.It was with great reluctance that I made my request that you should return here for I fear that it would have involved considerable inconvenience to you and I am glad that this decision removes the necessity for interfering with your plans. My only regret is that it also deprives me of the pleasure of seeing you again and personally offering you my good wishes.Yours sincerely, - -   &apos; (Sgd.)   AU&amp;m CHAMBERLAIN.The&apos;Hon. Albert Rathbone.II.Treasury Department, 7, Rue de Tilsitt, Paris.24th May, 1920.Dear Mr. chancellor,I was about to sign a letter to you advising that I would, be in London on June 1st, in accordance with the suggestion in your letter of the 19th instant, when I received your messages that you had written me another letter which would render my visit to ^ondon unnecessary.I have now the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 21, which reached me this morning.In view of the communication which the Prime Minister is about to send to the president, I have referred your letter to the Secretary of the Treasury and shall not now attempt to discuss the matter you refer to beyond restating the view of the United states Treasury that the questions relating to the debt of the British Government to the United states Government must be settled by those two Governments only, and that the indebtedness2.
&apos;^f*^hjexu3r&amp;VQ^^ a JUnerlcan&quot;G^ernin enVtxr &quot;to^th e Bri ti sh-Government, and the payment &quot;by Germany of reparations, are in no way related to the postponement of interest upon and funding of the obligations of the British Government held by the United States Treasury, nor to the other matters which were discussed during my month&apos;s stay in England for that purpose.permit me to express my regret at the termination of my pleasant negotiations with the British   Treasury, which, when I left Mr. Blackett on the 18th instant had resulted in sub-stantial agreement on nearly all points and gave fair promise that agreement would be speedily reached on the few matters that remained to be settled.   You will recall that the arrangement under discussion was one which it was clearly understood- that neither the American nor the British Treasury intended to adopt in dealing with the obligations of other Governments held by them respectively.Regretting that I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you again before leaving for America,I am,my dear Mr. Chancellor, Sincerely yours, (Sgd.)   ALBERT RATHBOFF.The Right Hon. Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Treasury, whitehall, ondon, s.f. 1.
