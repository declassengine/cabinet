corporation now circulate to my colleagues four papers on Mesopotamia accompanied by two maps which have been specially prepared.The first paper is a note which I have written on the general policy and to it is attached a map showing Jihe present disposition of the troops in Mesopotamia and the cost of each garrison.The second paper is a general account by Sir Hugh Trenchard of his scheme for Air Force control, with a map illustrating it.The third and fourth papers are a Minute by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff covering a Memorandum by the General Staff on the present position. It will be seen that, so far from favouring any reduction while the province is held or developed on present lines, the General Staff consider that our forces there are deficient in many respects. I have asked the General Staff to prepare an additional paper, which I shall circulate shortly, on a proposal to withdraAv our garrisons immediately at all points to the various railheads where it is so much easier and much cheaper to feed them, and where they can so rapidly reinforce each other reciprocally. Beyond the railheads, on this basis, there would only be political influence.I ask for the following decisions in principle at as early a date as possible: (1.) The transfer of Mesopotamia, and, if possible, of the Mandated Territories, to the Colonial Office.(2.) The fixing of a Grant-in-Aid for each by agreement between the Treasury and the Colonial Office.(3.) The transference of the military responsibility for maintaining order in Mesopotamia to the Air Ministry as soon as satisfactory arrangements can be made.(4.) The immediate contraction of our present area of occupation in Mesopotamia * no large garrison being kept at a great distance from the railheads. All the troops left over by this process to be sent home here, or to India, at once.It is recognized that if these decisions in principle are taken, a period of several months-in some cases of many months must elapse before they could.be rendered fully effective; but unless and until the decisions in principle are given, no effective progress can be made towards a curtailment of our responsibilities and our expenditure.W.

secret the CABINET.MESOPOTAMIAN EXPENDITURE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to the waste of money entailed by our present military and administrative policy in Mesopotamia, and to invite them to take certain general decisions of principle which will enable a prompt and drastic curtailment of expenditure to be effected. For this purpose I circulate (a) a map and table showing the present cost of our garrisons in Mesopotamia, and (6) a scheme which Sir Hugh Trenchard has prepared, in conjunction with the War Office, for the midn-tenance of order under the prime responsibility of the Royal Air Force.It will be seen that at present we have an Anglo-Indian army of GO,000 men with an immense quantity of followers scattered in detachments over an enormous area at a cost of upwards of 18,000,000/, a year. The War Office is not responsible for this distribution of troops. The Eastern Committee of the Cabinet animates the political policy in Mesopotamia. The Foreign Office, rather than the India Office or the War Office, gives the directing impulse. The political officers under the civil administration push our, into all sorts of remote districts on various pretexts the survey of the pipe-line to the Mediterranean, the exploration of the Mosul district, the pacification of Kurdistan, the care of the Chaldean and Assyrian refugees, and the general reconstruction of the Turkish province. They expect the military authorities to provide ample force to maintain order in all the districts into which they have penetrated.   This entails considerable garrisons at posts remote from Baghdad.In addition to these, a force is maintained at Enzeli, costing 2,000,000/. a year, which has nothing to do with Mesopotamia, but is connected with some undertaking which the Foreign Office has given to Persia. Thus indented upon, the military authorities on the spot, supported by the General Staff at home, take what they conceive to be the appropriate military measures.Each of these distant forces must be strong enough to resist every conceivable attack. All of them are supplied by long lines of communication, in many cases of communication by road, by Ford cars or pack animals. All along these lines of communication garrisons have to be established, each of which must be strong enough to resist the maximum potential force that could be brought to bear, and then from post to post along these lines there trickles at gigantic expense a stream of outward and inward-bound convoys.The result of this vicious system is that a score of mud villages, sandwiched in between a swampy river and a blistering desert, inhabited by a few hundred half naked native families, usually starving, are now occupied, have been occupied for many months, and are likely to remain so occupied in the future unless the policy is changed, by Anglo-Indiap garrisons on a scale which in India would maintain order in wealthy provinces of millions of people. To hold these worthless villages sums are being spent varying from 200,000/. to 1,000,000/. a year. Down in the desert near the scanty palm groves are established at the utmost cost and inconvenience the messes, regimental establishments, telegraph and signal stations, dep6ts, dumps and headcruarters of regiments, squadrons, batteries and battalions of British and Indian troops. Nothing is worse for the troops than to be kept in these circumstances without permanent accommodation or proper concentration with great numbers of their men being detached for every kind of subsidiary or quasi-military service, much ill-health, growing discontent, and absolutely no return that I can see proportionate to the ruinous expense.How long is this state of affairs to continue ? It will continue as long as the department calling the tune has no responsibility for paying the piper. So far as the War Office is concerned, I repudiate altogether responsibility for the policy out of which this condition of affairs has originated.(B20/210)   100. 5/20  H&amp;S   8189wo1825
in my opinion, we should start on the control and development of Mesopotamia from an entirely different point of view. We should hand the country over immediately to a Department of State which has a real knowledge and experience of the administration and development of these wild countries, which is accustomed to improvisations, and makeshifts, which is accustomed to measure the territory it occupies by tho amount of force at its disposal, and to measure the amount of the force at its disposal by the exiguous funds entrusted to it. The extreme dissatisfaction which the Foreign Office administration of the protectorates of East Africa, Uganda and Somaliland caused both in peace and war ten or twelve years ago led to their being placed under the Colonial Office, since which time, although development has been very slow because of want of money, it has been extraordinarily cheap and extremely successful. It is really marvellous how these enormous regions in East Africa have been held and are being developed without a single battalion of white troops. The whole of German East Africa, for example, has been taken over and is being administered without a single white unit being demanded from the War Office; yet German East Africa, as we know to our cost, contains large quantities of natives who were formidable fighters under the Germans. In Somaliland, again, a patient policy of waiting for opportunities, of knowing how and when to take appropriate action, and, above all, a frugal policy, has kept us out of any trouble or expense in this protectorate, and will in time secure its complete control and pacification. It is no reproach to the Foreign Office to say that they know nothing about administration. It is not their business. Moreover, as they have not got to get the estimates through, the financial aspect cannot be expected to weigh duly with them. The Foreign Office is the great Department of State the whole of whose experience and special aptitudes is devoted to the conduct of the relations of this country with foreign States, and to mix up with this the administration of provinces is to impair the discharge of both functions.I hope, therefore, that Mesopotamia may be handed over immediately to the Colonial Office. Secondly, that a grant-in-aid may be fixed year by year after discussion between the Colonial Office and the Treasury. In my judgment, this grant-in-aid should not exceed, even in the early years, 5,000,000/. for military expendi-ture, and ^,000,000/. for civil expenditure, or 7,000,000/. in all. It should be possible to make substantial reductions upon this at an early date. Within this limit the Colonial Office should be the judge of the whole administrative policy. It will, for instance, be for them to decide whether it is better to occupy more distant districts and thus raise their military expenditure, or to develop the nearer more peaceful districts and so reduce the military charges. But anyhow, they should know that there is a fixed limit beyond which they are not entitled to draw upon the resources of this country, and that they must do the best they can within the bounds assigned to them. This may well mean that large areas of which we have become mandatory will not be occupied for many years, and that the reduction of the country to order will be partial and gradual. This is only what we did in the Sudan, where one British battalion is the maximum garrison that has been allowed all these years. It is exactly the policy we have pursued in the Nigerias. I. have always regretted that more money has not been available for the commercial development of these teeming fertile lands in East and West Africa, which are capable of supplying the industries of this country with almost every conceivable tropical raw material they require in limitless abundance. I am profoundly disturbed to see colossal sums of money, which, invested in East or West Africa, would have produced a five-fold return in a few years, being poured out in sterile military occupation of comparatively barren regions in Mesopotamia.The sole line of argument on which it is safe to proceed is, first, to fix the amount that may be spent. Secondly, to give the administering department the power of choosing the policy within those limits. And, thirdly, having chosen its policy, to indent upon the War Office or the Air Ministry for the military force required. Of this force the War Office or the Air Ministry must be the judge. We must be entitled to say, &quot; To hold this district will require these troops and will cost you so much.&quot; We must also be entitled to say, &quot; These forces must be so disposed as to be militarily safe and not liable to be overwhelmed or surrounded.&quot; As a result of such a consultation between the two departments concerned, it will often happen that political officers will be forbidden to go into large districts for several years to come because the troops are not available within the limits of the grant-in-aid, instead of as at present these officers pushing out wherever they will and drawing a blank cheque upon our resources in money and men.
ifit the second place, I recommend to my colleagues that as soon as the administration of Mesopotamia is transferred to the Colonial Office I shall be given full authority to arrange with them the scale of the garrisons in accordance with the policy decided on and the scale of the grant-in-aid, and that subject to Cabinet approval of a detailed scheme I shall be entitled to transfer the military responsibility for sustaining the policy of the Colonial Office from the War Office to the Air Ministry, and to take the necessary steps to form the additional air forces required and generally to give directions which will result in the effective diminution even during the current financial year of the enormous forces and charges now involved.The first advantage of aerial control in this kind of country is that it wipes out altogether the need for lines of communication. From a central position at Baghdad, which must be made secure, air forces can in a few hours reach almost any point in the area which it is reasonable for us to attempt to occupy in the first instance. A series of landing grounds at convenient points held by small sedentary garrisons capable of maintaining themselves in a fort or group of blockhouses for a few weeks should be created in the outlying stations. These can, if necessary, be fed or reinforced or relieved by aeroplanes from Baghdad at any time, and there will be no necessity to keep in being the long lines &quot;of communication or to keep the garrisons of these detached posts equipped with transport, and in that condition of mobility which necessitates the costly burden of transport animals which have to be fed.Sir Hugh Trenchard has great experience not only of the air but in the clevelop-ment of these countries, having served for a number of years in command of the forces of the Nigerian Protectorate under the Colonial Office. I have not the slightest doubt that a thoroughly good arrangement can be made between the Air Ministry and the Colonial Office for the gradual taking over and development of Mesopotamia without the use of large forces; and I believe that economies more substantial even than those I have indicated here may be reached in the near future. The recent air campaign in Soinaliland was arranged quite simply and easily by private consultations which took place between the Air Ministry and the Colonial Office under the direct authority of the Prime Minister. It is to this collaboration on a larger scale that I look as the sole practical means of rescuing Mesopotamia from the fate of being utterly crushed economically under the burden of its military charges, and of freeing the Government from the accusation to which they are now open of profuse and futile expenditure of the taxpayers&apos; money.In considering the future profit which may be drawn from the Mesopotamian oilfields, it is necessary always to bear in mind the capital charges which are accruing. Every year we go on at the present rate of expenditure adds 1,000,0007. a year at 5 per cent, to what Mesopotamia will ultimately have to produce in order to yield a profit. Even if the oilfields bear out our most sanguine hopes, we are burdening them to an intolerable extent with capital charges, and what would be a thoroughly good business for the British Empire, if developed gradually and thriftily is being daily deteriorated by the sterile charges which are mounting up.w. s. c.1st May, 1920.

(This dec.-iment m the Property of His Britaraiic Majesty&apos;s Goyerninent.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1920.ELIMINARY SCHEME FOB THE MILITARY CONTROL OF MESOPOTAMIA BY THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.Memorandum with Covering Minute by the Chief of Air Staff.Secretary of State,WITH reference to your minute of the 29th February, and your statement in. Parliament on the possibility of the Royal Air Force taking over the military control of Mesopotamia, the Air Staff have prepared the attached memorandum on the power of the air to carry out work of this description, and submit an outline of the scheme for assuming this responsibility.With regard to the co-operation required from the Army, I have asked the C.I.G.S. if he will prepare a statement showing the number of fighting troops that will be required to carry out the role allotted to them; when this has been fully discussed and decided at a conference of the two staffs, the War Office will be asked to settle the nature and strength of the administrative services required for the combined fighting forces, and to prepare an estimate for the cost involved.An estimate of the cost involved by the enlargement of the Air Force to carry out this scheme will be forwarded, together with the cost of the Army troops, as a supplement to this paper, as soon as it is compiled.I am anxious to point out that an early decision must be arrived at if the Air Force is to assume responsibility for Mesopotamia by April, 1921. We have to put forth considerable efforts to render ourselves self-contained as regards repairs to aeroplanes and engines, necessitating considerable expansion of depots, &amp;c, in that country. The enlistment and training of personnel for work in Mesopotamia must therefore be taken in hand at a very early date, and this will involve an increase in the size of our establishments at Home. Further, in order to render ourselves really mobile, we have to develop the design of the supply aeroplane for carrying stores to isolated posts and the infantry-carrying&apos; aeroplane for the transportation of considerable numbers of men.I have forwarded this in order that you may be kept informed as to the lines on which I am working.   I would like to discuss it with you after you have read it.March 12, 1920.On the Power of the Air Force and the Application of this Power to Holdand Police Mesopotamia.1. Great as was the development of air power in the war on the western front, it was mainly concerned with aerial action against enemy aircraft and co-operation with other arms in actions in which land or sea forces were the predominating partner. In more distant theatres, however, such as Palestine, Mesopotamia, and East Africa, the war has proved that the air has capabilities of its own which can be usefully employed in operations against the enemy&apos;s ground forces, aud this power has been shown by aircraft&apos; whose design has not proceeded on the lines most suitable for work of this nature. Incapable alone of defending a country against organised external attack, the Air Force may yet impose considerable delay on an enemy whose lines of advance are limited and lengthy, and has proved itself a powerful a^ent for the attack and dispersal of considerable bodies of ground troops.2. If this air power be applied for the purposes of keeping order in a partially pacified area, the requirements of the garrison of such a country may be considered from an entirely novel point of view.   If ground troops are entrusted with thisH. TRENCHARDChief of A ir Staff.[26fi7&quot;jB
2responsibility, their lack of mobility necessitates their dispersal at widely scattered strategic points, entailing the establishment of long and expensive subsidiary communications. Moreover, in as much as this policy cannot be carried out universally owing to the prohibitive expense involved, disturbance in areas not garrisoned by troops necessitates the despatch of punitive columns: these columns have to be of considerable strength&apos;to overcome-opposition and to guard their own lines of communication.Operations have invariably to be limited in time, the objective gained as speedily as possible, and the column withdrawn to its base. Many years of experience on the North-Western Frontier of India shows that with the retirement of the column the punishment inflicted is speedily forgotten, and lasting results can often only be-achieved by permanent military occupation over a period of years with coincident opening up of the country by railways and roads. The difficulties of military action are enhanced when the enemy is a nomadic tribe; his mobility is often greatly in excess of the regular forces opposed to him, and his independence of settled habitat removes a definite objective for the operations of the troops.3. With the Air Power responsible for the maintenance of peace within the borders of a country many of these difficulties are removed. Only main lines of communication and a few aerial bases have to be guarded, and this is rendered easier by the comparative compactness of even powerful air forces. The &quot; long arm &quot; of the new weapon renders it ubiquitous, thus obviating the necessity of dispersal of force, and enabling the most distant and inaccessible districts to be reached without subsidiary lines of communication. The speed and range of aircraft makes it practicable to keep a whole country under more or less constant surveillance. Frequent friendly patrols, dropping leaflets containing suitable propaganda, disseminating correct news, and preventing the wilful misinterpretation of the orders of a political officer by intriguing headmen, may often prevent the seeds cf unrest being sown by irresponsible agitators. It must be remembered that from the ground every inhabitant of a village is undei the impression that the occupant of an aeroplane is actually looking at him, and th? frequent, and perhaps daily, appearance of aircraft apparently overhead will do much towards establishing the impression that all their movements are being watched and reported.4. Should unrest, however, develop, it is possible to obtain early information of hostile concentrations of marauding tribes. Within a few hours of receipt of such intelligence the Air Force caii carry out, at slight risk and at a minimum expense, punitive operations which might take days and even weeks of preparation before any forward movement can be undertaken by ground troops. The capacity of the Air Force to deal a swift and unexpected blow affords the chance of stifling the outbreak in its early stages, before unrest has time to spread; should, however, such early action not achieve decisive results, it is within the power of the air to continue its offensive action day after day and week after week, without intermission, until success is assured.5. The Air Staff are convinced that strong and continuous action of this nature must in time inevitably compel the submission of the most recalcitrant tribes without the use of punitive measures by ground troops, and they hold this opinion even in the light of recent events on the North-Western Frontier of India. With certain stubborn races time is essential to prove to them the futility of resistance to aerial attack by a people who possess no aircraft, but it is held that the dislocation of living conditions and the material destruction caused by heavy and persistent aerial action must infallibly achieve the desired result.The following up of air attacks by ground troops is only playing into the hands of the tribesmen by substituting for a foe against whom their efforts can effect little,, an enemy whom they can meet on comparatively favourable terms.6. Although it is stated above that the Air Staff is opposed to the employment of ground troops on major punitive operations in supersession of or complementary to aerial attack, it will be of advantage to have light armoured car units to enable military forces to complete the work of aeroplanes and reap the fruits of their success. This has been amply demonstrated in Somaliland, where the pursuit of the Mullah by the Camel Corps, which covered 120 miles in two days, was most successful in rounding up the demoralised Dervish forces and stock. Aeroplanes may, by means of wireless, direct armoured cars to a point they could intercept and round up an enemy column, or, if roads do not exist, it is possible to use aircraft to transport bodies of infantry with machine-guns for a similar purpose. This type i of aircraft can, and will, be developed to get a maximum power at a minimum of
cost for operations in a country where roads are deficient or impossible to traverse at certain seasons.7. These and other questions have not yet been fully explored, but Mesopotamia offers a good field for their exploitation. Weather conditions are more favourable for aerial operations than was the case on the western front during the great war, and much of the country is flat, and offers suitable landing grounds. Tribal jealousies prevent cohesion, and the most turbulent tribes are nomads or semi-nomads inhabiting country difficult of penetration by ground troops.8. From the foregoing remarks it will be seen that the full employment of Air Power should enable great economy to be effected in European and other military personnel, and thus in turn enable a reduction to be made in the number of hospitals and amount of shipping required to evacuate sick and wounded from a tropical country.9. The Air Staff have considered the question of policy with regard to the opening up of the country and the responsibilities this will entail upon the Air Service. A conference has been arranged with the Foreign Office to ascertain what is required from a civil point of view. In this connection it should be remembered that it is not immediately possible to have the country in a fit state to allow of political officers being stationed all over it; and that in no portion of the Empire taken over so recently as Mesopotamia have political officers been able to work without escorts for many years after the entrance of the British. In the interests of economy, and of life, it is essential that the opening up of the country should be commenced most carefully, and no political officers should be stationed in an area which is likely to rise and cause an expedition, but they should be taken by air to visit the various native chiefs as frequently as necessary, perhaps daily. The prestige of a political officer who is in a position to say &quot; I will return to-morrow, or next Aveek, with six aeroplanes, and if my orders are carried out I promise that no harm will be done to your village &quot; will be far greater, and, what is more important, the effect will be more lasting than if he can only threaten them with a punitive expedition, which, under the most favourable conditions would take a considerable time to make its power felt. It will be more economical, and better, to open up the country slowly piece by piece as the natives become more and more educated. Gendarmerie should be enrolled slowly to begin with and increased as their trustworthiness is proved. In the opinion of the Air Staff the success of holding the country with a small force depends upon strict control of the rate at which the various districts are to be made safe for the free movement of political officers. To carry this out a very efficient intelligence service is required, and the policy of peaceful penetration by frequent visits by air to important districts should be adopted. It may take from ten to fifteen years before the whole of the country inside the borders is secure to Europeans moving about the country.10. For the next few years the Air Council consider that it is absolutely essential that the control of the movements of political officers outside the occupied areas should be under the direction of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief.11. In conclusion of these general remarks, the Air Staff are satisfied that if the broad principles outlined are adopted, and the Air Officer Commanding is given full authority to carry them out, the country can be held on the lines laid down in the attached scheme.Air Staff,March, 1920.Scheme for the Organisation of the Forces of the Crown in Mesopotamia. Introduction.1. The information, on which this scheme is based is contained in Appendix (A), and is liable to revision after the closer examination on the spot, for which prepare tions are now in hand.Role of the Armed Forces in the Country.2. The duty of the Air Force, should the control of the country devolve upon it, will be the maintenance of internal order and the promotion of the gradual pacifica-tion of areas now in a chronic state of unrest. The duty of the military forces under these conditions will be essentially the safeguarding of aerial bases against likely local concentrations.    The force considered necessary for these purposes is not
4considered in any way sufficient to guard Mesopotamia against external invasion. In the event of a serious invasion from without by the Turks, Russians, or Arabs, or by any combination of them, reinforcements woula have to come from elsewhere.General Principles in the Scheme.3. In order to ensure the economy and efficiency possible in view of the radius of action of aircraft, all available aerial forces musl be grouped into a few localities which possess good communications and possibilities for defence. These main stations will be supplemented as required by advanced aerodromes, and military forces will be employed to guard both main stations and advanced grounds under the conditions prescribed below.Details of Air Force Stations, &amp;c.4. In view of its central position, the excellence of its communications, and the fact that it is the centre of administration of the country, Baghdad has been selected as the most favourable position for Air Headquarters, and with these head-quarters will be grouped the greater portion of the strength of the Royal Air Force in Mesopotamia, together with the various aircraft depots essential to the main-tenance of the squadrons in the country. This station will also be the headquarters of a group (see below).It is proposed to divide the country into three main groups, Northern, Central and Southern, each under a Group Captain, answerable to the Air Officer Command-ing-in-Chief.Northern Group [Shergat).Group headquarters, with two squadrons two-seater reconnaissance (D.H.9A) and one squadron twin-engine three-seater bombers (D.H.10), will be divided between Shergat and Mosul. From either place a flight of moderate duration will enable the Kurdish Foot Hills to be reached, at which line our first responsibility may be presumed to end. The D.H.10 Squadron is selected for this district on account of its high performance: operating from advanced landing grounds it will be of great value, should it be necessary to extend our influence into the interior of the Kurdish mountain country. It is proposed to establish protected landing grounds at Erbil and Kirkouk with a view to contioiling restless areas, which are at the same time of considerable commercial value.Central Group (Baghdad).Group headquarters with the following squadrons: 1 corps reconnaissance (Bristol fighters).1 single-seater lighter (Snipe).1 twin-engine bomber (Vickers-Vimy).1 lighter-than-air unit (two non-rigid airships).2 passenger carriers.The role of this group is the protection of Baghdad from incursions by tribes&apos; lying to the east or west, to safeguard the route to Persia up to the eastern boundary of Mesopotamia, and to form a central air reserve for the country. The fighter squadron, with long-range petrol tanks, will be employed chiefly on political communication work involving landing in confined spaces. It will also be available for such limited military co-operation as may be required.The Snipe Squadron will be of value for controlling Baghdad and districts not requiring a long flight from the base.The Vickers-Vimy Squadron will perform reconnaissance and bombing work, and will be able to undertake the-transport of small bodies of troops to outlying districts pending the provision of passenger-carrying squadrons. It may also be used for transportation of spares and supplies.The lighter-than-air unit will perform long distance reconnaissance work and the patrol of main communications.The two passenger-carrying squadrons will be available as heavy bombers, but their primary functions will be the transportation of considerable numbers of troops, to secure landing grounds or strategic points in combined operations and their main-tenance with supplies and ammunition by air.   The power to transport and supply
these troops should enable a considerable reduction in the total military forces in Mesopotamia to be effected.All squadrons are available for reinforcing other districts when required.It is proposed to establish advanced landing grounds at Kifri and Khanikin.Southern Group (Hilla).Group headquarters, with one squadron two-seater reconnaissance (D.H.9A) and one squadron twin-engine bombers (Vickers-Vimy).The role of this group is the patrolling of the lines of communication between Basra and Baghdad. One Vickers-Vimy Squadron based on Shaiba will also operate over the country at the head of the Persian Gulf, including the oil-field district at Ahwaz.The question of protected landing ground^ in this district is at present deferred in view 01 its comparatively settled nature.5. The total air forces in the country, therefore, would be :-Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, headquarters,3 group headquarters,3 squadrons two-seater reconnaissance,3 squadrons twin-engine bombers,1 squadron corps reconnaissance,1 squadron single-seater fighter,2 squadrons passenger carriers,1 lighter-than-aii unit.With the necessary repair depots and parks.Total personnel (approximate): 350 officers, 3,100 men, of which about 800 may be natives.military co-operation and fighting forces.6. The military forces to be stationed in the country are required to fulfil the following functions: (a.) Protection of main aerial bases at Baghdad, Shergat, Mosul, Hilia, and Shaiba,against likely local concentrations of tribesmen.(&amp;.) Protection of subsidiary landing grounds at Erbil, Kirkouk, Kifri, Khanikin.(c.) Provision of a small mobile column of light armoured cars, and possibly Camel Corps, at each of the headquarters, Baghdad, Shergat and Hilia, capable of operating to secure any advanced landing grounds that it may be necessary to utilise, and possibly to co-operate to secure the fruits of the success of an aerial operation. Military troops will not be used as punitive forces.The safeguarding of the lines of communication will be effected by aerial patrols.The Air Staff will be satisfied with the minimum number of troops necessary to safeguard R.A.F. personnel, stores and establishments, and to ensure that aircraft, while on the ground, may be enabled to work unmolested.All military garrisons should be self-contained and capable of withstanding any likely local attack for a period of one month : within this time it is considered that aerial operations will remove the danger and be able to effect the relief of the beleaguered force.[2607] - C
It is hoped that the ultimate provision of passenger-carrying squadrons will enable the militarv garrisons of the country to be considerably reduced.Until a further report; is received from Mesopotamia the question of armed vessels co-operating on the rivers must be deferred.Military Co-operation (Administrative Services).7. Administrative and other services, such as supply, transport, railways, signals, and medical services for both Army and Air Force personnel should be carried out by the Army units.Organisation and the Passing of Command.8. It is essential that the areas of responsibility of local R.A.F., military, and political officers should be coincident.Military officers within the Mesopotamia Command will be operationally responsible to the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief in a manner analogous to the relations which existed between the Air Force and the Army during the war, but this time in a reverse direction.The time and manner of the passing of responsibility for Mesopotamia to the Royal Air Force is a matter requiring further detailed discussion, but, broadly speaking, it is advisable that the Army should continue to exercise command and gradually reduce the number of troops in the country as R.A.F. squadrons arrive, until the R.A.F. has organised a force of eight squadrons. At this period the responsibility might be transferred and the troops again reduced in accordance with the policy already outlined. When the R.A.F. attains its full strength a further reduction may be possible, and this will be carried out under Air Force responsibility by . consultation between the Air Ministry and War Office after consideration of reports received from officers in command on the spot.APPENDIX (A).Conditions in Mesopotamia.Three Divisions of Mesopotamia.Mesopotamia is divided into three well-divided tracts : (a.) The Plain or area of cultivation in the neighbourhood of the rivers.(b.) The Desert of the West and South-West.(c.) The mountainous country on the North and East.Each of these tracts has its peculiar properties from the aerial point of view, and is inhabited by peoples with well-marked characteristics.The Plain.- 2. The plain area is normally of great fertility, though neglect has converted some of it into desert and swamp; the latter is unfavourable for the work 3f aeroplanes, but it may be said that in general the country is open -and of a nature to assist air operations. The population of this area is mainly urban or agricultural and their administration does not constitute a difficult problem. The great majority of the inhabitants have little or no political sense and care little who governs the country so long as they are prosperous. Their purview is limited to the affairs of. their own tribe. They are quick to recognise the benefits of good administratior, and are willing to pay for it if they get their money&apos;s worth. The large towns, however, constitute exceptions. In these there is an educated native who, under the former regime, had a certain share in the administration and of the proceeds accruing to the official class. This type of individual has been tried in the present administration, and has been found wanting in honesty and capability. Like the Babu class in India, he possesses a distinct leaning towards politics and intrigue, and he may be expected to exhibit Nationalist tendencies and sympathy with movements such as pan-Islamism, pan-Turanianism, &amp;c. It is probable, as the country is developed and additional areas made possible for cultivation, that the
tendency will be for elements of the nomadic and semi-nomadic population to settle down and take to agricultural pursuits.The Desert.3. The desert is favourable for the operations of aircraft, and in most places can be crossed by whesled transport. The population is essentially Arab: nearly every man possesses arms. They have little in common with the Kurds, and are unlikely to combine with them. The Arabs are the weightiest element in the population of Mesopotamia. If they were united in pursuits, disposition, character, religion and interests, they would constitute a very formidable body. The cleavage, however, between Sunni and Shiah and between sedentary and nomad Arabs is very marked. The Bedouin, or nomad Arab, is the most likely to give trouble; he is used to a continual but fairly harmless warfare of raids, skirmishes and running fights. In conflict with regular troops he confines himself in general to guerilla methods; treacherous and unscrupulous, his attacks are seldom determined; he possesses very little staying power, and his loyalty to any cause which he thinks is lost soon wanes.   The two principal Arab tribes are described below.Bedouin Tribes. The Anazeh, the largest group of Arab nomad tribes, occupies the triangle of the Syrian desert, which has its base about 30o latitude and its apex near Aleppo, about 360 latitude. On the east bank of the Euphrates the pasture lands north of Deiz-ez-Zor and along the Khabur are also Anazeh country. The Anazeh are not united under one head, but are divided into several large sections which maintain towards one another an attitude generally friendly, though it does not exclude marauding expeditions and private feuds among the smaller sheikhs Their hereditary foes are the Shammer, and for the last 150 years the history of nomad Arabs has been dominated by the rivalry between these two groups. Their geographical position gives, the Anazeh command over some of the main communications. Until 1911 the camel post from Damascus to Baghdad passed through their area, and the trade in sheep and camels between Mesopotamia and the west is dependent on their goodwill. The road down the Euphrates from Aleppo to Baghdad is also largely at their mercy. The united Anazeh forces would number about 9,000 men, if it were conceivable that they could ever be gathered together at the same time an exceedingly improbable contingency.The Shammar. Early in the 19th century the Anazeh forced the Shammar northwards across the Euphrates and split the tribe into two parts, one part being in Jezireh and the other in Jebel Shammar. The same sub-tribes are found in either group, and though they do not offer united resistance to their common enemy, the Anazeh, they are always friendly with one another. Any small sheikh of the Jezireh may bring down his flocks to Shammar if he wishes. The Shammar of the Jezireh have been estimated at a maximum of 10,000 tents. They come down as far south as Baghdad and extend to the west as far as Deir-ez-Zor. For many years they paid no taxes, but in 1911 the Turks sent an expedition against them, and they submitted without resistance.The Mountain Country.4. The mountain country to the north and east of Mesopotamia is one of the most difficult in the world. The peaks rise to over 11,000 feet in jagged ridges, divided by deep valleys covered with, scrub oak. The country is most inaccessible for any-thing but aircraft, and offers little prospect of probable development. The population is essentially Kurdish, of whom the nomad and semi-nomad sections give the most trouble. With the Kurds, though they are all Sunnis, tribal cohesion and general national feeling is even less marked than with the Arabs: blood feuds and inter-tribal enmities are strong obstacles to united action, and a general combination of Kurds is extremely improbable, though individual sections or tribes may give trouble Different groups of tribes differ widely in character, but they are normally superior to the Arab in energy, enterprise and industry. They are better fighters than the Arabs, but soon recognise the futility of opposing real force. The Kurd will probably form the greatest element of unrest in Mesopotamia.Population.5. The following figures are merely a rough estimate of the population:  Province of Mosul, 250,000.Irak, 1,511,000. j












r)       SECRET.MINUTE BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF. Secretary of State.I put up a short note on our military position in Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia and Persia.   I may say at once that it is very unsatisfactory.Owing to the continued delay in presenting a Peace Treaty to Turkey, owing to the fact that when presented we are quite unable to enforce its terms, owing to the series of disasters which the French have suffered at the hands of Turks and Arabs in Cilicia disasters which have obliged the French Government to reinforce that theatre up to 48 battalions (reinforcements which are not sufficient to avoid still further disasters), owing to our strained relations with Feisal and the very unsettled interior condition of both Palestine and Egypt, my own opinion is that it is very much more likely that we shall have to reinforce those theatres rather than weaken our garrisons.Turning to Mesopotamia I find much the same condition of affairs.Owing once more to our Turkish Treaty which, even at this date, contains no frontier between Turkey and Armenia; owing to our very ill-defined relations to the Kurds and Arabs ; owing to our Foreign Office commitments in Persia; owing to the deplorable weakness in our own Administrative Services and the consequent depletion of our fighting units to such an extent that many of them exist only on paper ; and finally, owing to the steady advance of Bolshevism to the south and the fall of Denikin, the Cossacks, the Caucasus and I do not know what next our position in Mesopotamia is none too secure even with the garrison we now have in that theatre.It is true that if we had plenty of aeroplanes and air personnel ; if our Administrative Services were fully manned by a competent personnel; if we had large numbers of armoured cars, tanks, mobile machine-gun units, all complete with trained personnel; if we had wireless stations, railways and roads; if we had well organized gas units ; we could now and at once commence a progressive, even a rapid, reduction of our garrisons. But what is the story of all these mechanical services ? We have struggled, and struggled hard, ever since the Armistice to fit out these services, and you know as well as I do with what poor results.The aeroplane programme is moving forward, but moving slowly; but the armoured cars, the tanks, the wireless, the gas and the Administrative Services have gone steadily back, with a deplorable result on the efficiency of the fighting units.These are some of the reasons why, in our opinion, we cannot at present reduce our garrisons in these theatres; and I trust you may think fit to lay these papers before the Cabinet, in order that they may be under no illusion as to our military position in Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia and Persia.Henry Wilson,C.I.G.S.6th May, 1920.(B20/219)  100 5/20 h&amp;S  8207wo
SECRET.POLICY REGARDING GARRISONS OP EGYPT AND PALESTINE, AND MESOPOTAMIA AND PERSIA.NOTE BY THE GENERAL STAFF.1. The General Staff desire to bring forward for consideration the situation in &quot;which the Army is placed at the present time owing to the conflicting claims of policy and economy.   There is a real danger that our policy will outrun our military resources, and this applies more particularly to the two areas Egypt and Palestine, and Mesopotamia and Persia.2. As regards Egypt and Palestine, Lord Milner, in consultation with Lord Allenby, made certain proposals for a reduction in the garrison, based on the essential condition that the frontiers of Palestine were not extended. By the terms of the mandate, however, we have been made responsible for Banias and Kuneitra, which are considerably beyond the areas- hitherto policed by our troops. In addition, the recent pro-Zionist declaration is likely to increase our difficulties with the Arabs, and there are already indications that military action may be necessary, both to maintain the frontier and concurrently to preserve peace internally. On the 22nd April, 1920, in response to instructions to reduce to the &quot;Milner&quot; garrison, the responsible military officer gave his considered opinion (Appendix A) that the present garrison was the minimum which can cope with . the task in hand. As will be seen from Appendix B, this garrison exceeds the &quot; Milner&quot; garrison by approximately two cavalry brigades and one infantry brigade. The General Staff are of opinion that the General Officer Commanding&apos;s estimate is justifiable, and that any premature reduction in the interests of economy will not only defeat its object, but may involve us in local disasters such as have occurred to the French in Cilicia.3. As regards Mesopotamia and Persia, the terms of the mandate have increased rather than reduced our responsibilities, whilst the obligations to Persia, which have been entered into by the Foreign Office, place a great strain on the weakest link in the military chain, namely, the signals, transport and supply services. In order to complete these services it has been necessary to draw on the combatant arms to an extent which has deprived British units of most of their fighting efficiency. In a recent telegram (Appendix C) the local authorities have stated that the force, which on paper amounts to two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade, has a fighting value not exceeding that of one division and one brigade. Apart from the difficulties of recruiting technical personnel an embargo, which was placed on the despatch of drafts on 23rd March, 1920,* deprived us of the opportunity for rectifying this deficiency before the trooping season closed, and little if anything, can now be done until the autumn. A further telegram, dated 4th May, from General Haldane (Appendix D) foreshadows the possibility of reductions being made in the autumn which would bring the total garrison down to one division, one cavalry brigade and some lines of communication units, but only on condition that no serious disturbances take place during the summer and that the requirements specified in Royal Air Force armoured cars and wireless personnel are fully met.4. Under normal conditions we might have hoped that the newly constituted Regular Army would have acquired increased efficiency during the last 6 months. Unfortunately the abnormal strain which has been placed upon it in every theatre outside Great Britain has not unnaturally produced an exactly opposite effect. Combatant units have been depleted to make up for shortage in ancillary services; troops have been ill-housed and constantly on the move ; guards have been excessive, with the result that training and musketry in the true sense of the word have been* Minute by Secretary of State. (B20/222)  100  6/20  H&amp;8  8212wo
impossible. In fact, the spring has been pulled out to its extreme limit and the metal is tired and is deteriorating. If garrisons are reduced prematurely, and drafts to the already depleted units are withheld, there can only be one result.5. Whilst fully appreciating the necessity for economy, the General Staff would be failing in their duty if they did not protest most emphatically against any further strain being placed upon the Army, such as would be caused by a reduction in the strength of garrisons unaccompanied by a corresponding reduction in responsibilities. Unless the Government is prepared to face in Palestine and Mesopotamia a repetition of incidents such as have occurred in Cilicia, there are, for the moment, only two alternatives: (a.) To retain the existing garrisons whilst making every endeavour to complete units to establishment and to make no increase in responsibilities, or(6.) To contract the areas for which we are responsible, and thereby allow of a gradual reduction in the garrisons.6. It is a matter of urgent importance that a firm decision should be given at an early date on which future plans can be based. Owing to the prevailing uncertainty as to the future, troops are living in conditions of unnecessary discomfort, which is affecting their moral, and is bound to have an injurious effect on recruiting in the future. Further, it is impossible to make any arrangements for reliefs during the ensuing truoping season, whilst the organization and administration of the Army as a whole is being most seriously hampered for want of a firm basis on which to build.General Staff,The War Office, S.W. 1,5th May, 1920.APPENDIX A.From General Headquarters, Egypt, to War Office.Despatched 1755, 22nd April, 1920. (No. E.A. 3070, cipher, 22nd April.) Received 2130, 22nd April, 1920.Your No. 84569, M.O. 2, 19th April. Telegram quoted is from Lord Milner and reduction you now order was contingent on boundaries not being extended and situation remaining normal. Situation has lately altered and all my troops are engaged on police work to stop raid from Bedouin of the border and to keep the peace inside the country, moreover no settlement has been announced. It is absolutely essential that present establishment be maintained for some time to come. Many units are considerably below establishment and I consider for the task in hand the present garrison to be the minimum.

Please see note by Secretary of State for War regarding situation in Mesopotamia, dated 12th November. General Staff memorandum involves two assumptions. Firstly, that we have got equivalent of two divisions in this country and, secondly, that it is easier to hold part of Mesopotamia than the whole.As regards the first assumption. The actual position is that bulk of British units in this country are ineffective, whilst India can only maintain Indian units in this country at Indian establishment, and Gurkha battalions are dwindling. The military value of the troops at present in this country does not exceed that of one division and one brigade on a war footing.Administrative services are being carried on with considerable difficulty, and continued presence in this country of numbers of Turkish prisoners of war, known incomplete state of railways, and absence of barrack and storage accommodation involves expenditure and maintenance of personnel on scale which would otherwise not be contemplated.The Royal Air Force and Light Armoured Motor Batteries, upon which we rely considerably, are also gravely deficient in personnel.On question of post-war garrison, please see my telegrams of 29th September and 21st October.   I still adhere to views expressed therein.As regards second assumption. It is my deliberate opinion we cannot withdraw to any appreciable extent, from the area that we at present occupy without endangering, our position from one end of Mesopotamia to the other.The abandonment of Mosul, Arbil and Suleimaniyah Divisions would so unfavourably affect our position in Baghdad and Basrah vilayets as to render our position before long untenable without considerable reinforcements.
These three vilayets form an indivisible whole. The Mosul vilayet has no natural&apos; economic connection with Turkey or Syria, and distrust and objections arising from our abandonment of Suleimaniyah, Arbil and Mosul Divisions, and inevitable anarchy resulting from removal of external control in these areas would have the gravest effect throughout the rest of Mesopotamia.We cannot appreciably reduce our responsibilities in this country without leaving it altogether and incidentally without repudiating engagements to Persia.Practical experience and theoretical consideration of the changes (? combine) alike to convince me that right solution for us, if we are to stay here at all, is to adopt armistice line without substantial alteration as our boundary, vide my telegram dated 2nd February, No. 1539. This brings Amadia within the federation; we should continue to administer it indirectly as at present and its inclusion would facilitate repatriation of refugees.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief has seen above aud concurs in its terms.APPENDIX D.From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Despatched 1200, 3rd May, 1920. (No. X. 8629, cipher.   3rd May.) Received 0915, 4th May, 1920.During the summer extensive reductions cannot be carried out, especially as. probable publication of peace terms, and of our intentions regarding the future constitution of this country, may be followed by a time of doubt and difficulty. If, however, the summer passes without serious disturbances, if Royal Air Force in this country is increased to its full accepted establishment, with thoroughly effective mechanical personnel; if I may be given (?) Tanks and personnel to man an extra company of armoured cars and a thoroughly efficient system of wireless communication, and if units are kept up to full establishment, I hope it may be possible to propose definite reductions early in the autumn, pending time whenjlocally raised forces become sufficiently efficient to take up some of the duties now performed by troops, to the forces foreshadowed by my predecessor in his No. X. 7538, and possibly for the further reduction of a mixed brigade, leaving one division, one cavalry brigade, with some lines of communication units, at Basra, as the total military garrison of Mesopotamia.Should this condition be established. I must emphasize that I shall be in a position only to maintain internal security, and not to resist external aggression, nor to reinforce or assist Persia if invaded. I propose to telegraph further shortly after (?) again examining facts and figures.
