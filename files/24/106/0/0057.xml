Several shells.struck the Customs House premises.      Sloops were sent, under a flag of Truce, to ask for an explanation.   The Admiral in command of this fleet stated, that he had been entrusted by the Moscow Government with the. policing of the Caspian Sea, and that, as he considered that the ships and naval forces of General Deniklni, which had taken refuge at Enzeli, were a source , of danger to the Caspian Sea, he had undertaken this bombardment on his own initiative.The Admiral finally demanded the surrender of DenikinTs vessels, and a temporary occupation of the port of Enzeli, pending the result of the &quot;pourparlers between the Soviet Government and tho English Government.    The following answer was given to the Admiral:-1.
