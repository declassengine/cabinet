Rej^eeerit^ion c^^the^People^Actj    Verier...ffer-*reaching alterations in franchise law are proposed in a private Bill introduced by members&apos; of the Labour Party, with the general object of equalising the franchise in the case of women with that of men.This Bill has entailed a certain amount of work upon the Department in tho preparation of notes and memoranda etc. upon clauses of the Bill and amendments thereto, and in attending Standing Committee *A Government Bill has been prepared in consultation between Parliamentary Counsel and Officers of the Department and the Scottish Office for the purpose of preserving in the case of men discharged from the Forces, the rights they acquired of being registered as electors before reaching 21 years of age.    This Bill has been introduced   and has passed the Committee stage in the Commons0 ?3^-JLJ?il Elflotlons- etc.    A private Bill enabling local authorities to adopt Proportional Representation in local elections was introduced in the House of Lordst     Notes and memoranda relative to the detailed provisions of the Bill have boon prepared by the Department, and amendments have been framed In consultation with Parliamentary Counsel with the object of rendering the Bill a workable measure in the event of its passing&apos; into law.     The Bill has passed the Lords.The subject of the postponement of the counting of the votes at Parliamentary elections was further examined by the various Departments, and in view of the reduced number of absent voters serving abroad it was decided by the Government to extend the system of voting by proxy and thus enable the postponement of the count to be dispensed with,-,    A Government Bill has been prepared in consultation with the Scottish Office and the Parliamentary Counsel, and has been introduced into the Commons.Steps/
.    &quot;&quot;  10 3Steps have been taken by the Department, in the case ofeach of the somewhat numerous Far]lamentary vacancies which have recently arisen, to watch for the if-sue of the writ and to move the service Departments and the Registration Officers concerned to take certain necessary action in advance of each bye-election.Registration.     It has always been evident that a longer time than that allowed by the Act is required for preparing and printing each Register, and, as on previous occasions, the question of the best method of securing the necessary extension in respect of the Autumn Register, 1G20, has had to be considered in a series of conferences with the Government Departments concerned, Registration Officers and Party Agents.     In view of the municipal elections in November, the date on which theregister comes into force could not be postponed, and it was found necessary to alter the qualifying period.    Ln orderin Council has accordingly been issued fixing the six month sending on the 15th June as the qualifying period for thepurposes of the register.The power to alter the registration dates will expire at the end of one year after the termination of the war, and legislation will therefore be necessary to secure necessary extensions of the period for preparing registers after the lapse of that power.     Proposals for modification   of the dates have been discussed at several conferences and are under consideration with a view to legislation,It has been arranged that a summary of the contents of the register shall be furnished to the Ministry, givingfor each constituency the number of absent voters, and foreach civil parish in the constituency the number of parliamentaryelectors, and of local government electors, distinguishingno tbetween men and women.     This will/only provide twice a year the electoral statistics previously made the subject of a specialreturn/
