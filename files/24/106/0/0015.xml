Referred toj Committee of Home Affairs 10(This Bocuxnent is the property of his Britannic jfojeaty^s Government UTRAINING OF FIT EX-SERVICE MEN,JACKETlo 15*J &apos; Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.It The manifesto, issued under the joint signatures of thePrime Minister and ivlr. Bonar Law before the last GeneralElection contains the following declaration:&quot;The care of the soldiers and sailors, officers and men, whose heroism has won for us this great deliverance arid who return to civil life, is a primary obligation of patriotism, and the Govern-ment will endeavour to assist such members of the armed Forces of the Crown as may desire to avail themselves of facilities for s Special &quot;industrial training, and their return to civil life under con-ditions worthy of their services to the country&quot;.It will be observed that this declaration is not limited - to the disabled, a fact which is appreciated by the ex-service men&apos;s organisations, who construe it as an unqualified pledge to provide training f&quot;-r every ex-soldier, including the able-bodied, who requires it, ,* 2, The scheme of training at present in force limits the training of the able-bodied to .-&quot;ex-members of HeM.Forces who, on account of joining those Forces at a comparatively early age, or for any other reason of a like character, did not enter upon an apprenticeship to a -killed trade&quot;.The inconsistency between this definition and the unlimited liability to training Implied in the above declaration was, I am advised, fully recognised at the time, but unless the Government is prepared to train every ox-service man who desires to change his occupation or who is now unemployed, amounting to a total of between (say) 200,000 and 300,000 men, some such limiting criteria a -pear to be neoessary. 3. The opposition of the Trade Unions, the dearth of facili-ties, and the large unsatisfied demand for training on the part of the disabled ox-service men, have compelled the Ministry of Labour to impose the following additional restrictions on the training of the able-bodieds(a) in certain trades, including most of the skilled trades of the country, training may only bo given to the disabledin accordance with agreements made with the Unions concerned,(b) in
(b)   in all other trades for vvhioh disabled men are suitable, preoadcnoe is given to thorn over fit men.The result is that hitherto little has boon done towards the training of fit men.Considerable pressure has been brought to bear on the Ministry of Labour to extend the provision of training for fit ex-service men, and the whole question has now been raised in a resolution of the Committee on the Re-employment of Ex-Service Men, on which the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress are strongly represented, recommending that training-should be given to &quot;non-disabled ex^sorvice men who have, owing to their service with the Forces, been deprived of the oppor t mi it]? of establishing themselves in a definite vooation.&quot;In considering this recommendation, it is neoessary to bear in mind that -(a) there are still 30,000 to 40,000 disabled men awaiting training, who will entirely fill for the next two years the accommodation provided by the present programme of Government graining Centres;(b) the goodwill of the unions and the absorptive capa-cities of the skilled trades, where there Is in general no dearth of labour, will be considerably taxed by the disabled men alone.Apparently, therefore, any scheme to give effect to this recommendation must be chiefly confined to the semi-skilled trades or to skilled trades that are unfit for disabled men and carried out in the main in employers workshops and not in State institutions.The possibilities of a scheme en these lines have been recently raised in a concrete form by a proposal made by a firm,/with
with the concurrence of the union concerned, to train ex-service men as puddlers, an occupation in which there: is an admitted . dearth of labour, in return for the payment of a training allowance for a few weeks.     The proposal has the merit of being economical, fulfilling an urgent demand for labour and furnishing an immediate opening for unemployed ex-aervice men in a well-paid &apos; trade.     The objections are briefly that as this is training which employers have always given at their own expense, the payment of allowances amounts to a bonus in aid of wages  , and that having conceded the principle in one trade, it will be difficult to resist demands for its extension to all, however unskilled.    As this is a test case, whieh raises the question of whether training is to be extended to the able-bodied in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Re-employment and on the lines indicated in paragraph 5., I must, before giving a decision one way or the other, ask the Cabinet to decide whether in view of the above faots,the G-overnmsnt is prepared to make grants towardstraining fit man in semi	-skilled trades,	for	shcrtperiods and in employers	workshops, with	the	prospectof being; pressed to extend such grants to all , .---------&quot;&apos; - -&quot;-&apos; - -&quot; &apos; -..........-..........-unskilied tradas.(Signed) J T.
