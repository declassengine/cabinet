J(This document Is the property of Ilia Britannic lfejestyl6-,G^voiniment)^^t) (jID1   SECRETStatistics of Retail Prices,MBiUORAMDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.CF.1311. I ciroulate for the informa-ion of my colleagues theattached memorandum upon the Statistics of Retail Prices which are published each month in the Labour Gazette.   It will be seen that these statistics, which are used very widely as indicating the extent to which the cost of living has risen, show every month the comparative cost of pur-oJiaaiAg the quantities of various commodities that macro up a wo^Ing^ class budget before the War.   I am satisfied that for general purposes this is the mo t satisfactory basis upon which to prepare a general figure indicating the movement of prices. But further, I wish my colleagues particularly to appreciate the fact that the index number thus prepared has been adopted &apos;  in a considerable number of agreements between employers and employed in various trades as the basis of wages settlements of which, the Railwaymen&apos;s agreement, the recent agreement for the Civil Service and certain agreements in the textile trades, are perhaps the most important examples. It follows, therefore, that any alteration in the basl- of the index number would -t once create a very embarrassing position in relation to these agreements; and if a change in the basis of the 3tatistics were to result in a reduction in the figure or, the fjOn^oral^ p eroent age in ere ase of prices,, the Governmentwould certainly be accused of manipulating the figures in _______order to resist demands for Increased wagesoI feel therefore, that it i&apos;s a matter of considerable importance that the present basis of the statistics should be maintained.   It is, however, equally important to remove the misconceptions which prevail in some quarters as to the nature and purpose of the calculations which underlie our statistics.(Signed)   T.J. &apos;MACtfAMABJUMinistry of Labour, Minister of Labour.19th May 1920.
RETAIL PRICES STATISTICS PUT&quot;. LI SHED IN THE LABOUR GAZETTE*1. The Statistics which show the course of retail prices and are printed each month in the Labour Gazette are widely used to estimate the extent of the increase in the cost of living:.     in spite of every precaution much misconception exists as to the nature and purpose of these statistics, 2. The statistics generally quoted are those showing the rise In retail prices since July, 1914 c   These have been published regularly in the Gazette since the early months of the war.   They cover the main, though not quite all, the items of working-class expenditure, Including food; rent, clothing, fuel and light and a miscellaneous group.   The items excluded a e mostly t ose of which the prices are not ascertainable with accuracy.   The excluded items represent a very small proportion of working-class expenditure and there is no reason to b -lieve that their inclusion would affect appreciably the general result.   In the statistics published, the details for individual items are shown separately, and a final average, is given which shows the cost of maintaining un-chanped the average pre-war standard^of 1ivlng in worklng-class_families *   Thus the statistics are based upon the pre-war, and not upon the present consumption of the various commodities. This is clearly stated In the Labour Gazette each month with all the necessary warnings as to the use of the figures, but the figures are often mis-quoted or quoted without the necessary qualifications,   Upon this basis the retail prices at 1st May, 1920&apos;showed an increase of 141 per cent upon the corresponding prices In July, 1914.3. As is pointed out each month in the Labour Gazette the pre-war standard of consumption has not remained entirely
..... \unchanged, 01 ing partly to shortage In supplies   f sugar, butter, etc., and partly to changes in working-class incomesc 4.     For over two years a second calculation has been made and published in the Gazette, showing the chan. c in expenditure, -allowing for reductions in supplies and other economies.   This calculation has just been dropped because statistics of consump-tion formerly furnished by the Ministry of Pood are no longer available.   It is doubtful whether, owing to the absence of trust-worthy statistics, the figures published under this head have been reliable in recent months.   They could only be contin-ued if regular   nniiries were instituted into working-class budnets and this would be an expensive matter.   The Sumner Commit-tee worked on these lines, but the results of the Enquiry were rejected by the workpeople, and they were open to the criticism that they presented the paradox of a fall in the cost of living concurrently with an all-round increase of priceso 5.     An alternative to showing (as is now done) the present cost of the pre-war - onsumption would be to show the pre-war cost of the present consumption.   Such a calculation would give a slightly lower percentage increase than is given by the methodcalculationnow adopted.   The material for such an alternative/ is, however, not available, and could be obtained only by frequent enquiries into the changes of expenditure which are still occurring in the average budget of the working classes.   The cost Of such enquir-ies would be very considerable, and it is very doubtful whether the results would have a value commensurate with the coast. 6.,    The question whether the pre-war standard of living should, in fact, be maintained or even improved, as claimed by the working classes, is or&quot; course a matter of policy.   Even if it were decided that the workpeople ought not to receive wage
advances on the full scale of maintaining the pre-war standard of living, it would still be useful to compile and publish statistics on the present basis,   These statistics furnish a measure of a quite definite kind which can be used? with the necessary adjustments, in connection, for example, with the fixing of wagescMinistry of Labour, 17th May 1920o
