Evidence reaching the Ministry continues to confirm the belief that some re-adjustment of the conditions of juvenile employment is necessary for the maintenance of adequate instruction, even in industries where apprenticeship has hitherto been generally recognised. The shortage of apprentices would appear to be most marked in the engineering and foundry trades, the building industry, printing, cooperage, and the leather trades. In these circumstances, any steps to maintain the supply of pro-spective skilled men are of value.Three lines of approach are open to the Ministry. In the first place, local arrange-ments can be made through the agency of the Juvenile Employment Committees attached to the Exchanges. In the second place, the officers of the Training Department, by maintaining touch with individual firms, can assist in the development of juvenile training. In the third place, the Juvenile Branch can take steps to stimulate the interest of the Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees in the question of juvenile employment. All three methods have been adopted, and in each case with a distinct measure of success.,(0 2002)  150  5/20 H * S 2 part I.Nil.Part II.-Departmental.Juvenile Employment.
Juvenile Employment Committees, during the last few months, have shown increasing interest in the question of learnership and apprenticeship. A growing number of these Committees have been led to establish sub-committees to inquire into these problems, and to negotiate with the employers&apos; associations and trade unions of their area to secure agreement on a joint programme. A few examples may serve to show the possibilities in this direction. The Bristol Juvenile Advisory Committee, in conjunction with the Bristol Reconstruction Committee, have formed sub-committees in seven industries, for which useful schemes are being produced. The Sunderland Juvenile Advisory Committee have secured the adoption of an improved scheme of apprenticeship for the building trades in their area on the lines of that of the Institute of Builders which is adopted in London. All apprentices are to be engaged through the local Exchange, assisted by the Juvenile Advisory Committee. The Norwich Juvenile Advisory Committee have convened conferences of employers and workpeople in the building, engineering, printing, textile and distributive trades, and in consequence of their intervention a local scheme for the regulation of apprenticeship in the building trade has already been adopted. This, too, follows closely on the lines of that of the Institute of Builders. At Newport (Mon.) the Juvenile Advisory Committee have induced the South Wales Regional Federation of Building Trades Employers to adopt an apprenticeship scheme which, it may be noted, provides for complete training by allowing the transfer of the apprentices from one employer to another, where this is considered necessary. They have also secured the approval of the master tailors&apos; and operative tailors&apos; associations for an apprenticeship scheme, which is being applied immediately in the town, and, it is hoped, will shortly be applied to the county. Further, although after inquiry into the iron and steel industry they feel that apprenticeship would be impracticable, they have nevertheless set up a sub-committee to encourage boys to enter the trade and to secure the adoption of a system providing a definite course of training fitting the boys for skilled work. In Exeter also, the Juvenile Advisory Committee have secured the adoption of an improved scheme of apprentice-ship from the building trades. At Luton, an apprenticeship scheme for the distributive trades, drawn up by the Juvenile Advisory Committee, has been in operation for some time with considerable success. A general feature of these local schemes is the establish-ment of an Apprenticeship Committee to supervise the training given, on which are generally represented the Juvenile Advisory Committee, the employers&apos; associations and trade unions concerned, and the local education authority.As regards the broader negotiations carried on with the Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Reconstruction Committees, good progress has also been made during the past few months. A number of these bodies have considered the question of juvenile employment, education and training in conjunction with representatives of the Juvenile Branch of the Ministry, and, on occasion, with representatives of the Board of Education. The Joint Industrial Council for the vehicle building industry, for example, have adopted the report of the sub-committee providing for a national scheme of apprenticeship and training. The Building Joint Industrial Council have also made provision for a national system of training and apprenticeship. The Joint Industrial Council for the cooperage industry have drawn up a scheme for employment conditions and the education of appren-tices, and the Joint Industrial Councils for the pottery industry, and for heating and domestic engineering, and the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee for gas mantle manufacture, among others, have also had the matter under consideration. A far-reaching scheme for employment and education has been prepared by a sub-com-mittee of the Optical Instrument Reconstruction Committee, and will be put into effect shortly. It will thus be seen that, so far as the development of the whitley Scheme permits, attention is being directed on a wide basis to the problem in those industries in which the shortage of apprentices is at present most marked.Since, at the same time, a number of trade unions and employers&apos; associations are independently pursuing the same end, there would seem to be a possibility of an improve-ment of the position as regards apprenticeship. Expressions of opinion, however, still continue to be received from some quarters to the effect that direct Government inter-position is desirable if learnership and training are to be dealt with adequately. The North-Western Counties Section of the Institute of Chemistry, to quote one example, have suggested that the training of works chemists&apos; apprentices was one which demanded the attention of the Institute of Chemistry, which should, in conjunction with the Ministry of Labour, draw up schemes of training, both institutional and in the works. The Liver-pool District Committee of the Scientific Instrument Makers&apos; Society have asked their executive council to take up a similar proposal with the Ministry.
qOAIII. The Labour and Socialist Press.Topics of Discussion.There is a paucity of noteworthy articles in the Labour and Socialist Press reviewed -this week. The discussion upon matters of domestic concern to the various Socialist bodies winch had been revived by the May Day demonstrations and the split in the Socialist Labour Party has, for the time being, dropped. The quiet progress of the Par-liamentary session has not given much scope for that current political criticism which is the easiest material for these papers to produce ; and the noteworthy series of settlements of important industrial disputes which marked the previous week did not give much scope for the exploitation of industrial unrest in the more extreme papers. Foreign affairs and the progress of the Polish offensive against the Soviet Government of Russia are of deep interest to many of these papers, but the general lack of information on this subject makes the discussion of it distinctly scanty. The topic most generally touched upon is that of high prices and the cost of living.High Prices and the Cost of Living.This subject is discussed in the light of two events, firstly, the resolution of the Triple Alliance adopted on the 6th inst., and, secondly, the increase in the prices of coal announced in the House of Commons by the President of the Board of Trade on the 10th inst. The Triple Alliance resolution is generally approved, though as compared with the reception given to previous Triple Alliance movements, there is a noticeable lack of enthusiasm. &quot; Rob Roy,&apos;&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; attributes the resolution to the rank and file pressure rather than to high strategy on the part of Trade Union leaders. He trusts that the undertaking of a cost of living campaign may result in the creation of a Trade Union &quot; General Staff.&quot; and suggests that the present confused series of disturbances in France indicates how a poor organisation may waste valuable effort. &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; however, is careful to point out that the world is suffering from a general scarcity of commodities, which only a few years of hard work and increased production will overtake. Mr. Philip Snowden, again, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; insists upon the complexity of the problem which the Trade Union movement is about to set itself to solve. The &quot; New Age &quot; doubts whether the Triple Alliance will prove equal to the occasion. This paper insists that profiteering is responsible only for a fraction of the present high cost of living, and that greater production is by no means a solution of the problem. With regard to the specific question of coa] prices, attention is almost entirely concentrated upon the increase in the price of coal issued for domestic purposes. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; argues that the policy attributed to the Government of dropping coal control at the earliest possible moment is mistaken in view of the fact that &quot; there can be no return to the pre-war Labour position.&quot; It is noteworthy that Mr. Philip Snowden condemns the resolution passed by the National Union of Scottish Mine Workers as being &quot; madness.&quot; &quot; There is no hope for a relief in merely demanding a wage advance : Labour should concentrate upon attacking the fundamental causes.&quot; In &quot; Justice,&quot; Mr. H. M. Hyndman reviews the whole administra-tion of the Ministry of Food, and puts forward a series of characteristic demands, the principal of which are the re-imposition of control upon all ordinary articles of food and the compulsory increase in the&apos;area of agricultural land under arable cultivation. The most curious demand perhaps is that bread should be rationed and a high standard of quality maintained. In a leading article these suggestions of Mr. Hyndman are endorsed and a fear is expressed that the slight grip on affairs gained by the organised workers during the war may speedily be lost again unless the responsible Labour leaders conduct the Trade Union movement in the right direction.Government Policy.The &quot; New Statesman&quot; comments, in its usual tone, upon the &quot; Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill,&quot; and upon recent decisions of the Industrial Court. The particular provisions of the Bill criticised are those contained in the second clause, which authorises double shifts of women and young persons between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. It is argued that no such arrangement would have been permitted by the International Labour Conference at Washington, and that the provision will make much more difficult the administration of the Act and the detection of offences. The &quot; New Statesman&quot; goes considerably beyond the limits of fair comment by endeavouring to convey the impression to its readers that the Home Office proposes to make women and children observe these hours, and that the clause will be widely taken advantage of by(C 2002) 2 F 2
employers. The criticism of the Industrial Court is based upon the strike of chemical workers which has followed upon the refusal by the Industrial Court to award them increased wages, on the ground that the industry was not in a condition to support the payment of any increases. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; believes that such decisions are bound to lead to trouble, and repeats the observations noticed in this Report for the 21st April, p. 192. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer&quot; devotes great attention to the difficulties of&quot; local housing authorities. The Labour group on the Merthyr Council are recommended to refuse to take responsibilities with regard to finance and similar matters, which, in the opinion of this paper, should be undertaken by the Ministry of Health.Trade Union Movement.The &quot; work to rule &quot; or &quot; slow gear &quot; movement inspires this week a leading article in the &quot; Railway Review,&quot; and an important article in the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; by Mr. T. C. Morris, who was president of the official national conference of signalmen which met at Unity House on the 13th and 14th May, to discuss the position of the signalmen&apos;s nego-tiations. The - &apos; Railway Review &quot; lays down in a somewhat pontifical manner the accepted principles of trade unionism. Emphasis is put upon the. facts that the railwaymen are taking part in wages board proceedings voluntarily and at their own suggestion, and that it is open for them in the accustomed constitutional manner to accept or reject the judg-ment of the Wages Board. The &quot; Railway Review &quot; insists that everything should be done in accordance with trade union etiquette, and claims that the trade unions&apos; standard in this respect should be higher than that of the commercial system which they are con-strained to operate. &quot; The members of the N.U.R. are bound in honour to the N.U.R. schemes until they, in constitutional form, decide to alter the irfethod.&quot; A special appeal is made to those who are taking part in the &quot; work to rule &quot; movement. It is pointed out that the N.U.R. has declared for its due measure of control of the railway services, and it is argued that a desire to control an industry cannot be justified by leaving the industry, or by refusing effectively to work it. Mr. T. C. Morris deals from the point of view of the rank and file with the domestic situation in the N.U.R. He declares that the solidarity that existed in 1919 is now shattered, and that the Government has succeeded in dividing the grades of the N.U.R. against each other, because the N.U.R. machinery has not been equal to the demands made upon. it. The particular complaint made is that the union is over-centralised and that country members have been robbed of initiative and control. Mr. Morris announces that the district councils which, met early in the year to consider a scheme of control of the railways, decided that control of the union was a more urgent matter than control of the railways, and have made this their immediate object. Mr. Morris hints that a new constitution is being drafted on the principles of grade autonomy and departmental control, and, also, upon the so-called Soviet form of indirect representation. The New Statesman &quot; considers the &quot; work to rule &quot; movement as the direct product of dissatisfaction existing throughout the railway service, and believes that the only way out is an immediate pronouncement by the National Wages Board on the railwaymen&apos;s claim. &quot; The only way of preventing strikes and unrest is to deal with all wage claims as quickly and as thoroughly as if a strike were actually in progress.&quot; The opinion may be expressed that the &quot; work to rule &quot; movement results rather from discontent on the part of the rank and file with their union officials and organisation, and it may be pointed out, in regard to Mr. Morris&apos;s article, that the holding in the past week of official conferences representative of shopmen* and signalmen members of the N.U.R. shows that the N.U.R. headquarters are fully alive to the difficulties of the position, and are meditating a modification of the machinery of the union along more conservative lines than the unofficial scheme hinted at by Mr. Morris.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; in a leading article, expresses satisfaction with the wages settlement arrived at last week in the Cotton Textile Industry. Special attention is drawn to the clauses in the various agreements, by which the lower-paid sections of the workpeople have secured greater percentage advances than the better-paid classes. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; is in thorough agreement with these provisions, though it is careful to say that it has never been of those who contend that every workman, no matter what his job may be, is entitled to the same amount of remuneration.The Socialist Movement.There are only three items worthy of mention with regard to the development of the Socialist movement in the papers reviewed this week ; namely, an article in the &quot; Labour* Gf. Mow, pp. 232 and 233.
Leader &quot; on International Socialism, an article in &quot; Forward &quot; on the function and con-stitution of Trades Councils, and several comments scattered throughout the press on the weakness of the Parliamentary Labour Party.Foreign Affairs.The principal topic of discussion is the Polish offensive. The opinion put forward, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, and by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; is that the principal allied Governments are responsible for this action of the Polish Government.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is the only paper to devote much attention to the situation in France. Last wreek it argued that the demands of the Confederation Generate du Travail were very similar to the nationalisation demands so frequently made by some British trade unions. This week the opinion is expressed that the present situation in France is almost exactly what the situation here would have been if the Trades Union Congress in March had decided in favour of direct action against the advice of its leaders. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; in judging the French position, retains its hostility to direct action. This paper regrets the forcing of the C.G T. into a premature conflict upon its nalionalisabion proposals.Part IV: General Topics.General Survey of the Week.The most important feature of the week under review is perhaps the publication on Tuesday, the 18th, of the Labour Gazette Cost of Living and Retail Food Prices Index Numbers for May. Each of these shows a considerable advance over the figures for April, and the executives of the principal National Labour bodies (the Trades Union Congress, the National Labour Party and the Triple Alliance) are in session devoting some attention to the problem of high prices in its relation both to Government and to Trade Union policy.Two minor trade disputes, a settlement of which, favourable to the employees, was reached in April, and, which were both concerned with industrial demarcation, are of interest as they may become precedents for further action. Seventy-two bricklayers and labourers engaged in furnace buliding, etc., in the Sheffield district, after a 17-day strike, secured the application of general building trade rates of wages. The other case affects mechanics, labourers, etc., employed in connection with the Dundee jute industry. These men must work the 48-hour week customary in the Dundee textile factories, though the hours in the engineering industry are 47. . After a seven-day strike, they have succeeded in securing the application of the principle that their 48th hour of work shall be paid at overtime rates.The most important issue still pending at the end of the week is the hearing by the National Wages Board of the applications for increased wages put forward by the N.U.R. and A.S.L.E. &amp; F. These are the first cases considered by this Board and much depends upon the success of the procedure adopted and upon the result of the whole inquiry.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces&apos; policies current for the week ended the 7th May, 1920, was 208,412 (206,650 lodged by men and 1,762 by women). There were, in addition, .12,345 policies (12,222 lodged by men and 123 by women) upon which payments had been made during the week, but which were not current at the end of the week. The previous week, the 30th April, there were 219,226 policies remaining lodged (217,186 by men and 2,040 by wTomen).66,564 unemployment books (43,310 by males and 23,254 by females) remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 7th May, 1920, making a reduc-tion of 691 since the 30th April. At the latter date 43,685 books were lodged by males and 23,570 by females (a total of 67,255).At the 30th April, 101 policies remained lodged&apos;by short-time workers, of which 65 were in the insured industries (90-7 per cent, being in the Engineering and Ironfounding Group), and 36 in the uninsured. At the previous week, ending the *23rd April there were 132 short-time policies remaining lodged, and 103 a month ago.
The total live register at all Employment Exchanges for the week ended the 7th May, 1920, was 275,926 men, 48,443 women, 23,935 juveniles, compared with 276,939 men, 48,976 women, 25,406 juveniles, a week ago (the 30th April), and 288,023 men, 46,023 women, 24,530 juveniles a month ago.Union of Post Office Workers.The first annual conference of this union began on the 13th May, at Morecambe. At the first session, the conference divided into sections, according to the demarcation existing previous to the amalgamation. Mr. A. C. Winyard, representing those previously in the Fawcett Association and the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association, stated that the Union of Post Office Workers was determined to aim at the ultimate control of the service. In this connection, it was essential that sectionalism in the services must be eliminated. Mr. Bowen, general secretary, announced that a Departmental Committee had been established to consider hours of duty, and that a proposal for a 38-J-hour working week would be submitted to that Committee. Mr. Bowen also announced the result of the ballot with regard to the participation of the Union in political action ; the voting was as follows :-For political action, 49,595 ; against, 5,772. On the 14th inst. a discussion took place with regard to the question of the adoption of a strike policy as a permanent plank in the policy of the Union. The secretary moved that a strike policy should be instituted, that a strike fund should be created by the introduction of a contribution of 6d. per member per week, and that arrangements for concerted action should be made with other trade unions. An amendment to the effect that, in the event of a strike, certain essential services should be maintained, was rejected. The conference decided almost unanimously in favour of a strike policy. This decision will, however, be submitted to a ballot of the full membership. An assurance was given by Mr. E. W. Bennett, of the Post Office Engineering Union, that no blacklegging would take place on the part of his Union if the Union of Post Office Workers decided on a withdrawal of labour. At the concluding session of the conference, a national programme was adopted. This includes (1) joint management of the Post Office by the staff in conjunction with the State, (2) full civil rights for Postal Workers, (3) equal pay for equal work, (4) a 38-1-hour week of five days, inclusive of meals, and time worked between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. to be regarded as night duty and split duty to be abolished ; (5) increased annual leave, improved pensions, and the abolition of auxiliary labour. Mr. A. C. Winyard is the Chairman of the newly-appointed executive, and next year&apos;s conference will be held at Edinburgh.Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.The annual conference of this body began at Leeds on the 11th May. Mr. J. Bromley spoke on the general question of Wrages Boards. He stated that suggestions had been thrown out lately from the employers&apos; side that National Wages Boards should be set up to fix wages in all industries, and that there should also be one Central W^ages Board, which would ultimately settle the wages of all classes of workers. He maintained that the formation of a Central Wages Board of this character would mean that the general body of workers would become &quot; bread and butter price slaves.&quot; He advocated that if the suggestion showed signs of materialisation, the working classes of the country should demand that the Central Board should have power, in addition to fixing wages, to limit profits in all sections of industry. An interesting feature of the conference was the reception as fraternal delegates from the National Union of Railwaymen of Mr. J. H. Thomas and Mr. C. T. Cramp. Mr. Thomas stated that there was still legitimate difference of opinion on method and fundamental differences on questions of organisation, but that in essentials they were in agreement. He maintained that the present method of working the railways had all the disadvantages of State control, with none of the advantages of State owner-ship. The railwaymen were determined to have a voice and a -share in the management and control, as they believed that they could contribute something towards greater efficiency, and that their long experience of manual labour was essential in any contribution to a solution of railway problems. Mr. Thomas concluded by speaking in opposition of a strike policy and in favour of political action.Railway Shopmen.On the 11th May a conference of delegates representing railway shopmen, members of the National Union of Railwaymen, met to consider the question of organising more efficient machinery for direct representation of shopmen in various centres. The executive of the Union proposed that shop stewards organisations should be formed with
Departmental Committees in the larger centres to deal directly with local grievances. It was suggested that when such an organisation was unable to effect a settlement locally, the matter should be referred to a Line Committee and afterwards to a National Committee consisting of representatives of&quot; the companies. and the shopmen. This general scheme was approved by the conference. The conference rejected the proposals of the craft unions for the application of district engineering rates and approved the proposal in favour of a system of standard rates on a national basis. The conference also approved of a national demand for a national standard rate of  6 a week for skilled workers,  5 for semi-skilled workers and  4 for labourers, together with eight days&apos; annual holiday with pay. This conference and a similar conference representing signalmen members of the N.U.R. which was held on the 13th and the 14th inst. are of great interest from the point of view of N.U.R. organisation.   (See above, p. 230.)Trade Union Topics.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. The agenda for the forthcoming annual conference of this federation includes a motion to give three months&apos; notice for the abolition of all piece work in the South Wales coal field. Discussion will also take place on a demand for the raising of the income-tax abatement level to  400 per annum exclusive of allowances, Another proposal will be considered for the termination of the 1915 agreement and the establishment of a new agreement embodying the present percentage wage, the war wage, the Sankey wage, the 14-2 per cent, and the last 20 per cent, into one standard rate.Colliery Enginemen. The Council of the South Wales and Monmouthshire branch of the Colliery Enginemen, Stokers&apos; and Craftsmens Association has decided to convene another conference to discuss the taking of a further ballot on the question of affiliation to the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. The last ballot was 154 votes short of the three-fourths majority required by rule.Amalgamated Engineering Union. This union will be formally constituted on the 1st July. A proposal is at present being made that the union should demand a minimum for skilled engineers of  6 10s. per Aveek.Ex-Service Men.Further trouble continues to take place in Bristol owing to the unemployment of ex-Service men. The Chief Constable has now intimated that no further processions will be permitted and that all damage to property must cease forthwith. In order to mitigate the distress among unemployed ex-Service men to some extent, it has been decided to establish an Ex-Service Men&apos;s Distressed Families Fund. A deputation of local ex-Service men proposes to wait upon the Prime Minister and the Minister of Labour.High Prices.Some, discontent and unrest continue in consequence of the continued increase in the cost of living. Much attention has been paid to the retail prices index number which at the 1st May showed an increase of 141 per cent, over pre-war standard. The Labour Party executive and the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. will both take the question of high prices into consideration at their meetings on Wednesday and Thursday, the 19th and 20th inst. The City of London branch of the I.L.P. is calling a special emergency conference, delegates of trade councils, trade union branches, labour parties, socialist parties, co-operative committees, ex-Service men&apos;s organisations, etc., to con-sider the socialist remedy for high prices.Payment by Results.The complete figures of the ballot of the engineering trade unions on the question of payment by results are not yet available, but figures have been announced for some of the constituent unions. In the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, 54,170 have voted against the proposal to empower the executive to negotiate on the subject with the employers and 14,170 have voted in favour of it. . These figures show that only some 20 per cent, of A.S.Ea members voted on this question. The United Machine Workers&apos; vote shows 5,970 against and 1,980 in favour, and the Smiths and Strikers show 2,910 against and 1,940 in favour. There is no doubt that the results as a whole will show a majority against negotiations taking place with regard to the adoption of payment by results.
International Relations,The International Labour Conference.-The second session of the International Labour Conference takes place at Genoa on the 15th June. The conference will be occupied solely with questions relating to the conditions of labour of maritime seamen including those engaged on inland waterways. Among the subjects to be discussed are the question of the application of the convention of the International Labour Conference held at Wash-ington on the eight-hour day and the 48-hour week, the application of the Convention and recommendations with regard to unemployment insurance, the application of the Conven-tion with regard to the employment of children of less than 14 years of age, and the examination of the possibility of establishing an international status for seamen to enable them to land at any foreign port without formality. The conference will also consider questions to manning and accommodation and also the extent to which articles of agree-ment are made with sailors and the extent to which the observances of these agreements is insured by State supervision, trade union action or other means. At this conference all the States belonging to the International Labour Organisation and to the League of Nations will be represented. Finland will also be represented with, however, only con-consultative powers.Third International. It is reported that a Congress of German, Slovak and Magyar socialists at Pressburg, on the 11th May, decided to join the Third International and to establish workers and peasants&apos; Councils in Czecho-Slovakia.International Association for Labour Legislation. The position of this body, in view of the inception of the International Labour Office, clearly required reconsideration, and a meeting for the purpose was held on Monday, the 17th inst.,of the British Section of this association. It was determined to re-organise the British Section and to send delegates to a meeting of the International Association which is to be held at Basle on the 7th July with instructions to support the re-organisation of the International Association and the sale of the Library at Basle to the International Labour Office. The amalgamation of the International Association on Labour Legislation with the International Association on Unemployment was also approved in principle. It was agreed that while the estab-lishment of the International Labour Office under the Treaties of Peace has rendered the old work of the Association no longer necessary, there is still much work for the Association to do, for example, promoting the ratification of Conventions adopted by International Labour Conferences, by means of Parliamentary and other methods, and the watching of the progress of legislation connected with those Conventions.T.
