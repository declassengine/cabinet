; lV Of 1 HP&quot;t a*) Ony*:iin * Jilt..&quot;it In connection, with the De-Oontrol of the inland dls-tribution of ooal it is neoefisary to deoide whether the retail price snail continue to be controlled or not*2,        The price for inland oonsunrption is at present con-trolled under thre&apos;e Aots or Orders, with their amendments, relating respectively to   -(a! The Pitrs Mouth Price i,e, the prioe which the Goal Owner may charge.(b) The Wholesale Prioe i*e. the prioe that the wholesale merchant can charge to oover the pit&apos;s mouth cost and transport costs and, his own charges and profi$*(0) The Retail Price, 1*0* the prioe which the retail merchant can charge to the ordinary consumer*3.        As regards (a) Orders fixing the maximum prioe will be retained but it is proposed to abolish the oontrol of prices to the publio affeoted by (b) and Co) leaving ooal merchanting to fall under the operation of the Profiteering Act.4*        The reason for removing the oontrol of wholesale and &apos; retail prioeu is that, under de-control, distribution will gradually get baok to its pre-War channels.    In some cases transport costs will be less than they have been, and in other cases greater, especially where transport by sea is substituted for transport by rail,in 18 uocuroont a t&quot;a p-hii
2 3 6 eUnder the system of fixed prices it has boon found necessary to subsidise the coal sent to certain districts when variations in production have necessitated the bringing of coal from a different area of supply.       It is most desirable now to discontinue subsidies altogether, leaving the consumer to pay a proper economic price for the coal. i.e, a price which covers initial oost of raising the coal, the cost of transport and ordinary traders charges and reasonable profit. &apos;It is necessary in view of the position of railway trans-port in the Country that coal should be oarried coastwise as much as possible, and in such cases the price of the coal will depend upon shipping freights.If retail prices remain fixed it will not be possible to gett sufficient (Juantitiee of coal transported by sea until freights fail to a level which compares favourably with railway rates. .3?he safeguards against undue increases in price are;-(a) The profiteering Act will operate in coal merchanting In the same way as in the case of merchanting any other commodity.    The standard of profit allowed under the Acts cited will give an adequate guide to profiteering- Committees which will.prevent prices being raised.     On the other hand many merchants will be in a position to supply at less prices than those Acts allowed to thetn(b) The merchants both wholesale and retail have undertciken to keep the middle-man^ profit within strictly reasonable limits, based upon the standards already established under our orders.    They propose to deal through their local trade Associations with any individual contravening the arrangements. In this, they will have the assistance of the various local Coal and Coke Supplies Committees on which they will be represented.(o)
4 f$ nJ. u ,(c) 111 the earlier stages of de-control the local Supplies Committees will usually maintain supplies through the existing channels to prevent a general scramble for coal. This supervision of direction will gradually be relaxed as competition between merchants comes into play.(d) It is very clearly realised by the retailers that any serious failure on their part to keep prices within reasonable limits will greatly strengthen the hands of those who advocate municipal trading.R.S.HOM3 25/5/20.
