VERSAILLESALLIEDMILITARYCOMMITTEE, PARIS,No. 945/1 26th May, 1920.chairman sOffices. OBSERVATIONS.With regard to the execution of the Military Clauses of the Treaty of Peace.CLAUSES WEIGH HAVE EOT BEEN EXECUTED,Alteration to German laws (Article 211).No law has as yet been promulgated for the purpose of abolishing compulsory military service and the organi-sation of the reserves, nor for the organisation of the Esiohswehr in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty.In point of fact Germany would still be able, from the legal standpoint, to utilise all her man-power by means of a general mobilisation.Furthermore, as the necessary measures were not taken in time, it mi&amp;ht be impossible for the German Govern-ment to organize by tho 10th July the army of 100,000 men provided for in the Treaty.Police Effectives:   (Article 162).The German Government&apos;has created, for the Empire as a whole, a corps of Sicherheitspolizei, with recruiting and organisation and its own military equipment.It has persisted in developing this institution, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 163 of the Treaty, the resolution of the Allied Governments&quot;dated 1st December, 1919, and numerous representations by the Commission of Control.
No matter what decision may later on be come to by the Allied Governments with regard to police effectives neoessary for maintaining order in Germany, no military organisation forbidden by the Treaty could be authorised for thlt?&apos; purpose.In order to settle these questions of (a) Alteration to be made to German laws, and (b) Number of police effec-tives, it is indispensable that a speedy reply be given to the German Governments request dated 20th April &quot;with regard to the maintenance of a permanent army of 200,000&apos; men, thus rendering impossible any excuse for fresh ; shuffling on the part of the latter and for fresh delays in the execution of the military clauses of the Treaty. .-&apos; GLASSES 7/iIIOH ABE BEING. EXECUTED. Delay&amp;is ohlefly caused by objections to, or requests for deviations from, the Treaty put forward by the German Government, and which the latter uses as a pretext for de-ferring the execution of all or part of the military or air clauses..In orfler to do away with this cause the Allied Governmenis should, when replying as above to the German Government, inform it that its request for deviations from the Treaty will not be considered by the Allied Powers.By Order,(Signed)   WEYGAND* &apos;

Clauses which are being executed.

(1) Military clauses.

A. Question of Armament and Munitions.

Article 169 (By 10th March).

Surrender of war material.

(a). German war material.

According to the Treaty of Peace, all German war material should have been surrendered to the Allies for destruction not later than 10th March. This has not been done. The principal causes for the delay being tardy arrival of lists of such material (the first lists having been received by the Commission towards the end of February), and insufficient means of destruction.

According to statements sent in by the German Government, the war material remaining to be destroyed on 5th January, 1920, amounted to

? guns or gun-barrels;

25,459? machine guns.

1,464,900 hand weapons;

273 flame-throwers.

On 10th May, the Commission of Control reported the destruction of:-8,600 guns or gun-barrels;

3,800 machine-guns;

562,300 hand weapons.

Such destruction concerned (1) war material remaining to be destroyed as at 5th January, 1920 and mentioned above, and 2) war material which the Germans destroyed between the armistice and 5th January 1920, the destruction of which the Commission was really in a position to vouch for.

Consequently/
9 ft&amp; y j51 9% Consequently, tho Quantity of material romai^   . to ho    -ed.destroyed is higher than tho difference bctv/eon the^xrst and the second figures. Furthermore, this difforenco may become yet more narked, owing to-Discovery of hidden material which may to made by the Comniosion;Reduction of the German army from 800,000 to 100,000non;D if.&apos;, armament of &quot;tho &quot;Sicharhcitspolizoi&quot; and the ,rSin-wohnorwehron&quot; y who have about 500,000 rifles, of-which i General Hollot lias been ordered (by the Versailles Alii&apos;v. Military Committeo ) to demand immediate delivery.It should bo pointed, out that the total number of hand weapons which tho Germans havo to hand o. r* to us in. accordance with their lists is patently inadequate, ovon if the weapons available by reason of the disarmament of the &quot;Sicherheitspolizoi&apos;1 and&apos;of the &quot;Einwolmerwohrcn&quot; ore added thereto,.Jb). Non-German materials, .   This material should have boon delivered to the Allies, as their property, on or before 10th March.Statements sent in by tho Germans up to the present specify only:-1,787 guns or gun-barrels;1,606 trench mortars6,200 machine-guns;626,000 hand weapons.       .These figures are too small and cannot bo accepted.Tho ViAoMoOs has drawn General Holletxs attention tothe points mentioned under (a) and (b),(oh   War material other than weapons (harness, oquip-ment, carts, etc.
6*? n ailotwithstauding all demands mado by the Commission of Controlk. the Gorman Government has as yet given obvious-, ly insufficient particulars regarding war material * other than, weapons properly so called - to be surrenderod to theJilll0Li t(d).. , Owneruhro of destroyed Gorman \A.r material The German Government, has disputed the decision taken by tho Ambassadors1 Conference on 10th February, according to which ownership of destroyed material was vested in the Allies...At tho request of the VwAJ.wCc, this decision has been once more confirmed (resolution of Ambassadors1 Con-fcronco dated 81st May),Results attainedH os li 11 s To botaincd.Article 168 (By 10th April). -Closing down of non-approved war factories and arsc-nals;   dismissal of personnel. .Irivatoly-o nod factories.- By 8th Hay, 1920, some 612 factories had been or were being visited; 341 had had notice to close down,-Stato-ownod factories and arsenals. - On 26th Pobru-ary, 1920, tho Commission of Control authorised tho Gorman Government to retain 2 war factories for the manufacture of gunpowders, explosives, and ammunition respectively, and ashed it to submit proposals oa this basis.     The German Government having, on 8th April 1920,. proposed that 79 fac-tories should bo retained and this proposal having been considered inadmissible; that Government ashed (on 24th April) that 40 factories should be retained.     This re-quest was likewise refused;Reductions in the personnel of war factories and ar-senals have taken place-, but dismissal of the entire staff is dependent on the abolition of these ostablisli-ments. .
7,      *     8.Privately-owned factories. -   Up to the present, the Germans have only sent in tho names of 2143 privately- owned factories manufacturing war materialW    This fifeuro is^bvioualyw too small.Violation of conditions. -    During a visit to the Krupp factories at ^sson, tho Commission of Control became aware of the clandestine manufacture of war material (sixty 77&quot; suns and 180 ammunition waggons) for account of the German Government.The Commission of Control gave orders that manufacture of this material should bo suspended.B.   question of Effectives.Art, i el eg. l60 and l63   and Resolution of Suoremo Council dated 10th February, 1920 (By 10th April).Reduction of German Army.Its      -      Former Army, hied., The decree of 6th March, 1919, instituted the Reichswehr which was to replace th^ former army.Dissolution of the former Army has taken place.    The various bodies- designed for preparation for war (mebiliza-tion department s. of tho Ministry   for %r (General Staff and Army Corps Headquarters Staff) have disappeared.     There remain, however, tho various offices winding up such bodies and the reoruiting offices settling claims in connection with pensions and military services - who no longer deal with matters conc-*min  mobilisation, as has been duly noted by the Commission of Control, /it Former Army.inod.        - Tho personnel of offices concerned with winding-upwas reckoned at 70,000 on 10th Marah.      General Nollet sum-msned the German Government to abolish those offices by 10th April, but his aotion has had no effect.(l)   The 612 factories visited are included heroin.
*! ri q,The German Government did not transmit to the Commis-sion of Control the order issued by tho Minister forReichswohr ( dated 3rd March), reducing the- German Army to men200,OOl/ before the 2nd cf April.This order was not in agreement with the Treaty of Peace, and more particularly included an excess number of 50,000 men.On the 17th and 22r.d April, 1920, the German Govern-ment was giver: explicit orders to bring its army of transition Cf 200,000 men infcg l;ne with the provisions of the Treaty. The. German Government issued instructions that these reduc-.tions should bo made by the ljth May.Side by side with the regular army there still exist:-Free Corps. (Marine brigades^) and some Free Corps with a total strength estimated at 40,000 men.&quot;Zeitfreiwilliffen&quot;. The German Government has given orders that those should be dissolved (except the corps existing in tho Ruhr district and in Leipzig, which are necessary to maintain order).     The dissolution of the &quot;Zeitfreiwilligen&quot; cannot yet be reported., however,-anc^ it may be said that the German military authorities are not using any haste to bring it about.&quot;Ejnwchnerwehr&quot;.- The German Government gave or-ders for its dissolution on 8th Ax?ril, bit this order to the Governments of the various German regions was issued in euch terms as render its execution improvable, It was more a suggestion to oam.cu fla^e the Citizen Guards still -further, by altering their armament and abstaining from military exercises, rather than an order for their abolition.As a matter of fact, no abolition of this Guard has(l)   One of these brigades said to have been-dissolved.
o f: srs10. ^idboon notod, , and no surrender of arms has Von made.&quot;oicherhoits-polizei&quot;   This continues to exist under its fo^ner organisation.     The Germans acknowledge that it includes 50,000 men:   the Commission of Control estimates its strength at 60,000.To sum up, the former army had disappeared by tho 10th II&quot;y, but reduction of the now army to 200,000 men hasnot yet been carried out.     Side by side with this new army are Free Corps and 2 rarino Brigades.If the Gorman Gbvernnont has duly ^iven orders that the &quot;Zcitfreiwilligen&quot; and the &quot;$inwohnerwhhr&quot; should bo dissolved, those orders have apparently not yet been carried &apos;out.Also, nothing has boon done to dissolve the &quot;Si*hor heitspolizoi&quot;.. The V.A.H.C, has instructed General Hollet to plasS these, various violations of the Treaty&apos;cf Peace on record.Article 176 (By 10th March).Abolition of Military Schools.   -As at 13th lay, it was reported that this clause had boon oxeoutcd viz:-&apos;  &quot;94 military schools dissolved, the German Government having (in accordance with Article 176 of the Treaty) ro-taincd not mcro than one school per arm., or four schools&quot;.Since that date, it has been noted that so far as certain schools, and mcro particularly that of Grose-Lichtorfaide, the largest school - are concerned, only tho name has been altered, the pupils remaining and a larrjc number of professors being retained (23 out of 60 at Gross-Liohtorfolde).Tho V.A.M.C. has instructed General Nollet to place these violations on record, and. tc see that this rlausc
2p; a11.is carried out in its entirety.2,     AIR CLAUSES.Article 199 (by 10th March).Demobilisation of air forces.. .............................-...............-.........................The demobilisation of air forces should ha^e taken piece by 10th March.   It was owing to the German Government which tried to e^ade this demobilisation by asking that air police forces should be retained. - that demobilisation didvnot take place before 8th flay.   It is now being supervised.The Ambassadors1 Conference refused the request as. to air police forces on 11th March.Article 202 (By 10th April)Delivery tf Aeronautical Material.All German aeronautical material was to ha^e been de li^ered to the Alliesj as their property, on April 10th at latest.The Air Commission of Control has checked delivery o nearly all the German aeronautical material, amounting to:-8,900 aeroplanes 445 hydroplanes 11 airships 13,000 engines72 airship sheds 23,000 metres of aeroplane sheds Destruction commenced on 3rd May, 1920.3.     GENERAL CLAUSES *Article 208Facilities granted to Interallied Commissions of Con-trol for accomplishment of their missions.The German Government has not been able to guarantee to the Commissions of Control the facilities which were tt
ha**e been granted in accordance with Article 206.Numerous cases of the i-rtrman Governments unwilling-ness to carry cut the Treaty of Peace were recorded in Report No.456/1 cf 19th&quot;March,Since the end of April, the Commissions of Control ha^e again met with a certain amount of resistance, by the Germany military authorities, regarding the execution of the military clauses.   This resisLance took on a well-defined form as from 1st Hay; it is due to an order is-sued by the Central German Bureau to its various representa-^ti^es, and tending to make any unexpected exercise of control by the Commissions impossible at Breslau; Colonel &quot;on Luck, head of the German liaison service, informed the officers belonging to the Commission of Control that he had received instructions from Berlin that such officers were not to ask any directv vquestions of the units or services which they might &quot;isit, but were only to ask for a programme common!cated before-hand to be carried out and to check the replies gi^en in writing by the German representativeeAt i-hirtemburg and at Cassel, similar notifications were made to members of the Commissions of Control.The insults and ill-usage offered to members of the Commissions of Control at Prenzlau, Dresden, Berlin, Bremen, Friesark, and ,:?ernitz were reported to the Am-Dassadors1 Conference by Marshal Poch&apos;s letter of 12th March,   Nothing was done as an outcome of this letter*A&apos; fresh insult is sported as having been of-interfered to an officer belonging to a Commission of Control, &quot;iz:-On 6th May, Lieut.Colonel do France, when inspect-ing the Mins^iir- camp, was the victim of a demonstration by soldiers belonging to the Ehrart marine brigade.
Miss:.les were hurled at his ear, the windows of which were smashed.   Colonel cle France was not hurty.
Clauses which have not been executed A, Ques tion oi&apos; Armament and Munitions.Articles 167 a ad 196 (by 10th March).Reduction of stocks of ammunition for artillery of fortified works &quot;which Germany may retain.The stock of ammunition for artillery of fortifiedworks which Germany may retain is to consist of1,500 rounds per piece for puns of which the calibre is 10.5 cm, and under;500 rounds per piece for those of higher calibre.The Germans, however,. as ed to be allowed to retain 5.246 pieces of artillery in these fortified works.The Commission of Control required a considerable reduction of this figure on March 18th.-  On April 16th the German Government asked for a reversal of this de-cision... In its note of&apos; May 5th,.the Commission of Control maintained its decision,.but it has resulted in no execution of the article in question by the German Government..The reduction of the stock of ammunition therefore remains in suspense until such time as the number of guns to be retained in the fortified works has been made&apos; to coincide with the figure fixed by the Commission of Control..The V.A..;.:.C. has given General Wollet instructions to require without delay delivery of the surplus pieces of artillery in the fortified works, and, should delivery not be made, to ta e note of this violation of the Treaty of Peace..
article 170 (By a date not yet determined).Prohibition to import and export arms and war material.On several occasions, the last of which was March 11th, the Commission of Control called upon the German Government to prohibit by law the import and export of arms and war material.No satisfactory reply has been made by the German Government to this categorical demand.Bi   Question of Effectives.Article 182 and the Resolution of the Supreme Council of December 1st, 19J1T7Abolition of the &quot;Sicherheitspollzel&quot;.See Articles 160 and 163, &quot;Reduction of the German Army&quot; in &quot;Clauses which are being executed^.Article 211 (By IQth April).Alteration of German laws, in conformity with the military clauses of the Treaty.No alteration has been effected in German law.A decree published in the Official Gazette of the German Army abolished the military obligations of the Reserve Forces in peace-time, but no law has been pro-mulgated abolishing compulsory military service or the Reserve, which continues to be mobilisable.
It is beyond question that Germany has taken no initiative with regard to the execution of the provisions of Parts VIII and IX of the Treaty of Versailles and that she has adopted an attitude of passive resistance thereto, bringing into play c^ery possible means of delaying execution v/hen it has been demanded of her either by the Allied and Associated Powers or by the Reparation Commission.   As, however, the exact meaning of the term violation of the Treaty, in the legal sense of the word, still remains a question of appreciation as regards the majority of the obligations undertaken, the use of the word has been intentionally avoided in the present note, which only deals, on the one hand, with the extent to which the clauses ha^e been executed, and on the other, summarises the measures taken by both parties with a view to their execution.PART VIIIo.  Article 255.    This has not been executed in any way as regards payments in gold or securities.The extent to which the clause has been executed as regards deliveries In kind will be dealt with under the heading of Annexes.The Reparation Commission asked the German Government in a letter dated March 4, 1920, how It intendedto meat its obligations under Article 235.   The reply has not yet been received.&apos; &apos;       The Reparation Commission authorised the German Government to requisition neutral securities in order to appropriate them to purposes of food supply (March 4.,POSITIOW AS REGARDS THE EXECUTION BY GERMANY OP Parts VIII, IX, X and XII of the Treaty of Versailles,

See the information gi^en with regard to  the Annexes.Articles g38 and 539^    Restitution haa centinuod in accordance with the Armistice as regards industrial material.   In the case of restitution of animals, furniture, works of art, etc, execution has not been begun.The Reparation Commission has only recently decided to send to Wiesbaden an Interallied Sub-Commission charged with the immediate negotiation with the Germans of the protocols for the restitution of animals and objects other than those mentioned in tho Armistice protocols..The German Government has taken no initiative as regards restitution in execution of Article 233, and has refused the requests for restitution in advance made to it by the French and Belgian Restitution Services set up under the Armistice for objects other than industrial material, stating that it must await the decisions of the Reparation Commission.Article 241.   The German Government does not appear to h&apos;r*e passed any legislative measure or issued any regulations with a &quot;low to ensuring execution of tho Reparation clauses of the Treaty (always excepting a law voted August 31, 1919, authorising the issue of the bonds provided for in Annex II).The German Customs Regulations have been dra-mi up entirely with a view to discouraging export to Prance, and especially to the Liberated Regions (see Part IX).AWHFX II., Paragraph 12.Delivery of Bonds.     This has not been executed.As soon as the Commission was constituted, it pro-condor! to deal with this question, and on -January 30 it

The reply was received on Hay 12,&apos; and was aatis-factory in principle.- The Reparation Commission ia about to reply, fixing the form which it intends to give the bonds.ANNE7 IIISea-going vesso1s.    Germany must deliver 2,750,000 tons in round figures..   She delivered 1,830,000 tons before the entry in force of the Treaty; &quot;since then, she has only delivered 16,0C0 tons.germany made an appeal to the reparation Commission regarding the surrender of a certain number of ships. This request v,as refused on March 30, 1920.   Since that refusal the number of vessels delivered in execution of the clause has been insignificant (16,000 tons),.River Craft.     No execution has been effected as regards&apos; those craft, except in the case of vessels de-livered by way of restitution, of which roughly 60$ have been handed over.Paragraph 2 of Annex III states that all ships men-4tioned in ttio Treaty are to be delivered within two months of the coming into force of the Treaty, -Not only does Germany &apos;not execute the clauses, but she reserves to herself the right to refer the question of the surrender of her merchant fleet to the.fpa Con-forenco.   She induces neutrals to &apos;tako action,&apos; and the
Swedish Government has made representations in Paris, which it has doubtless repeated in London, with a &quot;low to arranging that Germany nay retain the ships required for the transport of Swedish ore to German ports.   The ships in question represent a considerable tonnage of boats of 1,600 tons and upwards.The surrender of river crrft by way of reparation has required the intervention of an American arbitrator, ho has only just been appointed,   Germany was asked on &quot;:&apos;arch 16, 1920, by the Reparation Commission to furnish a list of her river craft within one month.   She has not yet replied.Germany has therefore only partially executed her obligations by way of restitution while as regards replacement, she has taken no preliminary stops whatever to prepare to fulfil them.   The American arbitrator is to decide upon tho method of surrender.; he will arrive on June 2, and. instead of having to consider a natter prepared and ready to hand, he will have&apos; to start or emise work to be started from the very beginning (see below, on the contrary, as regards Art.557).ANNEX IV.Supplies for physical restoration.    No deliveries under this head, except one consignment of barley and. oats for sowing.     A spirit of complete obstruction on this point has been particularly evident.   Germany had agreed as f nr back as July, 1919 to fulfil the clauses of Annex IV in advance.The Reparation Commission recently forwarded to Germany the lists referred to in Annex IV.Negotiations were entered into at Versailles between the Allied Governments and the German Delegation, with a view to contribution by Germany towards the reconstruction
of the devastated regions.   A preliminary list of in-ddspensable materials, cement, bricks, tiles, glass, etc. was handed to the German Delegation at the first meeting; other lists were sent it shortly afterwards..   Although they had entered into a formal undertaking to apply the terms of Annex IV of the Treaty in advance, the Germans have never replied to any of these requests in a manner capable of leading to a positive result.As a matter of fact, during the course of these meetings, they stated that they were more particularly willing to collaborate in the reconstruction of the devastated regions, by undertaking vast building opera-tions in those regions, for which they would not only supply the materials, but. also the labour and, generally speaking, the management, the French Government doubtless retaining the functions of principal, but the German Government exercising every initiative as general con-tractor for the work.   This scheme, the plans for which were worked out in great detail, involved giving the Germans such a hold over the reconstruction of the liberated regions, and the demands relative to the status of the German workmen in France were so imperious, that the matter obviously called for ripe consideration.   In the end, negotiations regarding this general programme were suspended.They were, however, continued uninterruptedly, durin. the whole period which elapsed between the signature and. the coming into force of the Treaty, with respect to the deliveries in kind to be effected in advance execu-tion of Annex IV.   They were pursued, simultaneously by the Ministry of Industrial Reconstruction.   The Office for the Reconstruction of Coal Mines and the Ministry of the Liberated Regions.   The history of these nego-tiations is the same in each case.   The German Dolega-tion receives- the request and promises to proceed with
the necessary investigations.   After weeks or months, the reply - when it arrives - takes the form of attenuated offer, limited to certain kinds of supplies which are amongst the least indispensable and the least urgent, and accompanied by propositions of inacceptable prices.Thus, for instance, the Ministry of the Liberated Regions received, on March 15 last, after six months of negotiations, a firm offer of joinery (doors, window frames, etc.)   The prices proposed were more than double those paid for goods purchased in Prance by the &quot;Service des Materiaux&quot;.In some exceptional cases, the prices suggested might be accented, if it were a question of a free contract, not involving the application of the supplies to the Reparations account.   But it is obvious that it is not possible, in return for some advantages of a secondary order, to prejudice to a very great extent byw ell meaning acceptance of such offers, the method of calculation to be adopted by the-Reparation Commission in fixing the value of the supplies delivered in execution of Annex IV, and all these offers, none of which is calculated to satisfy any vital requirements of the devastated regions, must be re-fused.   There was one exception to this general rule; in the case of a consignment of barley and oats for sowing, the German Delegation agreed to the only possible course, namely, the subsequent determination of the prices by the Reparation Commission,   The reason was that it was to the interest of Germany to introduce her seed barley and oats Into Prance in order that they might become known.   Two days later, in the case of a delivery of beet seed, as this reason did not exist, the German Delegation refused the same arrangement and demanded that the price should be fixed beforehand, and even then the contract could only be concluded if payment
wr e ma d o i n c a sh a nd in f r a nc s *Cave for the single instance related above, and for some few deliveries of cattle (see below), Annex IV has hitherto remained a dead letter.   This does not prevent the Germans from declaring that they are exhausted by the payments in kind that have been imposed on them or from making this declaration one of the most familiar themes of their press.Cattle.   Although a protocol relating to the de-livery of cattle in execution of paragraph 6 of Annex IV was signed box ore the coming into force of the Treaty, so that the deliveries might commence immediately upon its entry into force and be completed within three months as stipulated in the Treaty, the deliveries effected up to May 1, 1920, have not amounted to more than some 20$ of the quantities required.Germany was to deliver to Prnace, . id thin three months following the coming into force of the Treaty, in equal monthly instalments, the following quantities of live stock :-500 stallions; ; 30,000 fillies and mares (18 months to7 years)2,000 bulls (18 months to 3 years); 90,000 milch cows (2 to 6 years);1,000 rams; 100,000 sheep; 10,000 goats.These quantities represent approximately the tenth part of the cattle carried off or destroyed in the de-vastated regions by the Germans, and only constitute a delivery on account of the totalrestoration provided for in paragraph 2 of Annex IV (Reparation) .If the stipulated period&apos; had been a dhered to.,- the delivery of the live stock would now have been completed.The first train-loads of restored live stock passed the French frontier on March 6 last; even if this date were taken as the regular starting point of the operations
flop &amp; 0 \jthe deliveries ought to have been completed at the bo-ginninr. of June.The report by the Inspector General, Mr. Leclainche, shows tho present position a s regards tho restoration of live stock j -&quot;On April 30, the following had been returned&quot;to France:-&quot; 3,858 horses out of 30,500, or 12,5%&quot;19,210 cattle &quot;     &quot; 92,000, or 20.8 &quot;27,950 shoe: &quot;     &quot;101,000, or 27.6 &quot; 4,095 goats &quot;      &apos; 10,000, or 40.95;:&quot;The attached table gives details oi  the live &quot;stock returned to each of the Receiving Centres.&quot;Information received shows that horses are &quot;very difficult to obtain.   The contemplated &quot;musters announced by the German Supre e Commission &quot;have been postponed on various pretexts or even &quot;for no reason at all, and, further, the only animals &quot;produced fail to correspond either in type or &quot;quality to those required.&quot;As regards horned cattle, deliveries are made &quot;more freely.   Precise details cannot, however, be &quot;given at present.   While the territories on both &quot;banks of the Rhine and South Germany are delivering &quot;regularly, marked resistance is met with in Prussia. &quot;This is&apos;particularly noticeable in the Bast, East &quot;and West Prussia, Pomerania, Brandenburg and &quot;Silesia.   Incidents occur which testify to fierce &quot;hostility, if not on the part of the whole popula-&quot;tioii, at least among certain elements.   The Com-%isalons are threatened in the hotels, and the &quot;German Commissioners make remarks of an unfriendly &quot;nature.&apos;. This attitude is entirely different from &quot;that observable in the West and South, where the &quot;relations between the French and German Commissions
9 O n * b *&quot;aro courteousw.&quot;Th/j figures given in tho attaohod table show &quot;that scarcely any restitution of any kind haa boon &quot;offooted in former Prussia.   There is no doubt that &quot;the instructions given, by tho German Commission at &quot;Frankfurt,, that is to say, by tho Government of the &quot;Reich, are not b-jing obeyed.&quot;It will be necessary to contemplate measures of &quot;oooroion if this resistance persists.&quot;If tho work of recovery is carried out so slowly on account of the ill-will, if not tho hostility, of the  . Prussian authorities, it will take at least nine months in the case of cattle and 15 or 16 months in the caso of horses, instead of 3 months.    There is no doubt that the Prussian author!tios are endeavouring by every moans to elude one of tho most prsoise clauses of the Treaty of Versailles.   Ho serious reason for this can be put for-ward by Germany;   the regions which aro most refractory as regards delivery are probably those which contain the&apos; best cattle for the restoration of the devastated regions, and the numerical importance of this line stock is such that, as stated in one of the previous reports of Inspector-General Leclainohe,. the supplies provided for are insignificant in proportion to those which exist.Agricultural material referred to in the Armistice. : (Annex IV. paragraph 7).    The deliveries of this material-have been almost completed,. 9Ofo of the total having been   -received. AHHEX V.Coal. . Germany had agreed to begin deliveries of coal before the.coming into force of the Treaty of Peace (Protocol,, of August 29), such advance deliveries to be
Y/ritton off after tho entry into force of tho Treaty the rate of 300,000-tons per month.The advance deliveries actually made amounted roughly to:-1,000,000 tons from September 1, 1919, to January 10, 1920.This quantity must theroforo bo added in the pro-portion of 300,000 tons per month to the deliveries made by Germany after the entry into forco of the Treaty.Germany has delivered to France since January 10, 1920:-Hote;- These figures are arrived at after having made the necessary adjustment for deliveries of coke, in the proportion of i$ tons of ooko to 4 tons of coal,Immediately upon its constitution, the Reparations Commission provisionally confirmed tho programme laid down in the Protoool of August 29, 1919, which was to ensure Brance a monthly tonnage of approximately 1,600,000 tone, on the basis of present production.   ITo effort fct increase was made during the months of January, February and March.   The first regular notice was given by the Reparations Commission for the month of April, calling for a supply of 1,140,000 ton3 for Franco;   see the result above.The Reparations Commission has fixed the amounts to be delivered to Franoe for May, June and July at 1,450,000, 1,600,000 and 1,650,000 respectively.Sulphate of Ammonia.

PART IX.       IMOIA  CLAUSES.Article 248.    Information has boon received from various quarters that Germany la exporting objects made of gold into Switzerland.Tho Reparations Commission has taken  no measures with respect to this.Germany has placed various loans abroad which have not been communicated to tho Reparations Commission; one arrangement only, made with Holland, was submitted to it for consideration, relating to export of coal. as a mattor of course Germany should contract no loans nor export any products set apart for restitution in kind, without special authorisation from the Rapara-tions Commission.Article 259.   This has not been exeouted.Article 260.   This has not been executed.   It is reported that securities referred to in Artie la 260 have been offered on the London and Hew York markets.In its letter of April 10. 1920. tho Reparations Commission requested the Gorman Government to furnish it, in conformity with the final paragraph of Article 250, with a list of the rights and interests referred to in that article.    No reply has so far been .made to that request.Article 261.   This has not been executed.PART X.     SCOnOMIO CLAUSES tThe object of tho econcmio regime established by the Treaty of Peace is to oblige Germany to apply the same treatment to the Allied and Associated Stated ae that applied to any other most favoured foreign country.Up to the present, Germany has contravened theso provisions.
Having been prohibited by Article 269 from imposing, during a period of six months in the case of the majority of gooda and during a period of thirty-six months in the case of certain other  pods, any higher duties on imports into Germany than those which were in force on July 31,1914, she conceived the idea of levying those duties at the gold rate as from July, 1919.     This principle was ad-rnitted by the Supreme Council and the Reparation Corn-mission (December 9, 1919) although the result- is that goods exported from France, Italy or Belgium into Germany are subject to duty three or four times heavier than was the case before the war, by reason of the depreciation of the franc and lire.The other clauses of Chapter 1 of Part i have all been violated, both as regards import and export,The question was brought, before the Ambassadors1 Conference and discussed by a Technical Committee, which rendered its report at the Meeting of May 18*The Committee, which was composed of English, Belgian, French and Italian Delegates, considered, after study of the documents submitted by the various DelegationsA. With regard to Imports :-(1) That certain cases might be adduced in which the conditions of granting or refusal of import licences might have been made with the purpose, and had had the effect, of placing the products of certain Allied or Associated cour.tries at a disadvantage in favour ox the products of other countries, or even of placing national exporters ox certain products at a disadvantage, to the benefit of certain foreign intermediaries.The Committee considered, however, that in the majority of cases of this nature, it was particularly difficult to obtain both the documents showing the views
of the complainant and those of the &quot;beneficiary from the violation.(2)   That in particular the monopoly ox wines and that, of spirits have been exercised in a manner preju-dicial to the products of certain Allied and Associated Powers and have allowed of certain measures of confisca-tion and taxation, the retroactive character of which aggravates their arbitrary nature.(3)   That products originating in and obtained from Alsace-Lorraine have, contrary to the provisions of Articles 68 and 268 of the Treaty of Peace, been submitted to import duty.(4)   That in the ease ox products of Alsace-Lorraine which, within the limits of the amounts notified to Germany, ought to be exempt from customs duty on presenta-tion of certificates attesting their origin and place of export, import has been prohibited and (or?) the goods have been burdened with the onus of procuring a previous licence.(5)   That the application of the provisions of the Ordinance of March 22, 1920, with regard to the products of the Saar Basin is being effected contrary to the pro-visions of paragraph .31 of the Annex to Article 50u With regard.....to. j)xports.(1)   That, on the intervention of the Gw,mian author-ities or of syndicates established and controlled by those authorities, differential export tariffs have been established, varying either for reasons of political preference, according as they are applied to countries, formerly allied to Germany, to neutral countries or to ex-enemy countries, or for reasons of economic preference, which it was precisely the purpose of Articles 265 and 266 to prevent.(2)   That export duties are imposed the existence of which has not been published and which confidential ,
- 30 -circulars suggest should he mentioned neither in contracts nor on invoices,,(6)   That the benefits-of certain products or raw materials are reserved, either by means of allocation or ox preferential discrimination, to certain countries to the detriment of others, the industry or victualling of which are thus menaced,(4)   That numerous contracts concluded by nationals of the Allied or Associated Powers have been altered orbroken,at the direct or indirect.instigation of the german authorities, who intervene by increasing the prices,demanding surcharges or premiums, stipulating for payment in the currency of the country of destination or someother foreign country, or by suspending export accordingto the fluctuations of exchange, and that, in certain cases, contracts have been thus broken to the advantageof buyers in other countries.The Ambassadors1 Conference approved the conclusions of the Report, according to which the commercial regime of Germany calls for a certain amount of adjustment, the nature of which was, moreover,, described by the Technical Committee,.  The British Ambassador has asked for the consent of his Government to his participation in the adoption of a note to be sent to the German Government, calling the attention of the latter to the violations of the clauses of Articles 264 to 268 of the treaty of Peace and pointing out the means of giving satisfaction to the Allies, while preserving the freedom of its commercial re girae *An agreement was recently concluded (May 17) between the *ranch and German authorities, regarding the execution of Articles 68 and 268.   Goods from Alsace-Lorraine are,

Tho French and British Governments have in vain protested against the differential prices charged in Germany itself to foreigners, especially to nationals of those countries. . Thus in the case of the French Embassy in Berlin., the members of the Embassy have to have a special earl per-mitting them bo pay ordinary prices.   Prices are in-creased in shops, hotels, and restaurants by secret orders from the German Administrative authorities to an extent double or even five times the amount of prices paid by Germans.INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY.Articles 306 and 307. . Germany is seeking to evadethe stipulations of Article 307 respecting patents, asis shown by the following note handed by the French Dele-gation to the Ambassadors1 Conference&quot;Under the terms of article 307 of the Treaty oi Peace of Versailles of June 28, 1919, a minimum period of one year after the coming Into force of the ,Treaty, without extension fees or other,penalty, must be accorded to the nationals of each of the High Oon-tracting Parties, in order to enable such persons -
fcQ. j&amp;ooompOjuah any-act^ ;fni il -artf SXmas2J frA pay, any fees, and generally satisfy any obligation, preeraEbe^ by the laws or regulations of the respective states relating to the obtaining, preserving or opposing rights to., or in respect ofy industrial property either acquired before august 1, 1914, Or y.hlch,. except for the war., might have been acquired since that date as a result of an application made before the war or during its continuance.&quot;How,, it is shown, by reliable information re-ceived by the French Government that the administra-tion of the German latentamt,. which, during the con-tinuance of the war,, granted no patent corresponding to applications made by $ranch nationals prior to August 1,. 1914.. or subsequent to that date during the war,, has just proceeded to grant a large number of patents coming within this category.   The German administration alleged that the patents thus granted subsequently to the date of the coming into force of the Ereaty of Peace   ^re. not subject to the provi-sions of Article 307 of the Treaty, and that: conse*-quontly the annual fees falling due from 1911 to 1919 inclusive ara immediately, demandable and must, be paid within six weeks from the ftate on which the patent was granted.&quot;There is no doubt that this interpretation is manifestly contrary to the text of article 307 as quoted, above-    This article refers,, in fact, to rights of industrial property which,, except for the war, might have.- been, acquired since ^ugust 1, 19M&apos;,. as a result of an application made before the war or during its continuance,, and. for the preservation of which a. minimum period of one year is accorded-,, reckoned from the coming into force, uf the Treaty,.
in which to pay all fees prescibed by the laws and regulations without extensJ.on.jfeo&amp;--or--othe-r i^caJJ^y-,Under the terms of Article 8, paragraph ct of theGerman Patent Law of iipril 7, 1891, the fee must, in theory, be paid for each patent at the&apos;beginning ofthe- second year of its duration and of each subsequentyear, and according to Article 7, the duration ofa patent begins to run from the day of declarationof the invention, that is to -say, of the deposit ofthe application.   The object of Article 307 of theTreaty is to allow of the payment; of fees which fell within a period of one year, due during the war and werenot paid when due, and it cannot be admitted that theGerman Administrative authorities are now able to declare that all these annual fees are payable immediately,on the pretext that the patents have only just been granted.At the very utmost, it might be admitted that thespecial fee of 30 Marks payable upon the granting ofa patent is demandable within the ordinary period,upon advioe being received that the patent has beengranted.   Any other method of procedure would constitute an obvious violation of the Treat;, ofPeace and cannot be allowed.&quot;On the other hand,, the German Administrative authorities are also said.to assert that in the case of patents refused during the war, by reason of the interested party having failed to reply to the ob-jeetions of the fatentamt within the specified period, the refusal must be upheld and the only re-course open to the interested party is an appeal against $he decision.   This interpretation is also contrary to the terms of Articles 307 and 306, which stipulate for entire restoration of rights of in-dust rial property and the according of a minimum
period of one year in v;hich. to- fulXiX any f^rrmadjrby-and satisfy any obligation prescribed by the laws ar regulations relating to the obtaining, pre-serving or opposing&apos; rights to, or in respect of, industrial property.   Consequently, the original refusal must be considered null and void, and the procedure for the granting of patents must be resumed at the point at which it stood prior to such refusal..     /reach national!: cannot lose the benefit of these two provisions, when their application has been   refused by reason of the non-accomplishment of any formality within a prescribed period,&quot;It may be pointed out that the branch Decreeof January 27, 1920, accorded German nationalsfull and entire restoration of their rights, sub-j&amp;ct to the accomplishment of legal obligationswithin a period of one year-&quot;
9 0 0- .35 -f rabies XII..Ports, Waterways and aal lways.-    The provisions of Part III of the Treat,1/ of Versailles have not, properly speaking, been the object of definite violation by Germany,     Their very general bearing and the distant date at which some of the undertakings are to be carried out, on the one hand, snd the state of European communi-cations and the difficulty of transmitting to the competent body information or complaints arising by reason of Eventual German   measures, on the other hand,- do not allow of any instances being cited as contrary to the Treaty and provoked by Germany.^rticle 357. -   The provisions of Article 357 (which provide for the cession of river craft and shares in idiine navigation companies) have formed the object of negotiations between the French and German authorities..     These negotiations have not yet had any result, and Germany is said to have expressed the intention of bringing the whole question of this article up before the opa Con-ference.ks regards Par.3 of -:.rtic3  358 - by which this Power undertook to hand over to the French Government cer-tain documents concerning the regulation of the ithine -4 1these documents have not yet been handed over, notwith-standing various requests to do so.furthermore,, the French Government has had no reply to letters in which it requested the German dovermmt to furnish the names of its representatives on the Central hhine Commission and to fix the spot where the Odor Commission is shortly to meet, which spot this Corn-mission left it to the uerman Government to choose.It should fina ly be reported that numerous sales
- 56 tof river craft or of appliances and installations in the port of Rotterdam have been made by German companies to various neutral countries, thus apparently depriving Jfrance of an important guarantee.Article 367; movement of trajns, -    Germany has op-posed passive resistance to the application of articles concerning the movement of trains. -  She first brought forward the argument of technical difficulties, and then made inadmissible claims with regard to tsriffs and the movement outside Germany of the coaches of the Mitropa Company, which belonged to the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-lits and were sold by the German sequestrate? of the latter company.Aotive negotiation took place and resulted, on 20th May, in an agreement signed by the representatives of the German, Belgian and French Governments, which settled railway circulation across tformany to Inland, Czecho-olovakia, ^ustria and the Last-

Although it is not possible absolutely to demonstrate that non-surrender of the warships at that date is a violation of the Treaty by the German Government, it is none the less certain -as proved by events - that the necessary arrangements for handing over the ships were not made.^ &apos;    Article 192.   -   The naval war material men-tioned in this article should have been surrendered to the principal Allied and Associated Powers for destruc-tion.    The -German authorities have broken the terms of the Treaty by destroying part of such material without informing the N.I.A.C ,C.,

Furthermore, on 2nd May, 1920, the G-erpin autho-rities refused to hand over any plans or documents other than those which they might see fit to deliver.    This attitude and its restrictions demonstrate an unmistakable intention not to carry out the obligations incurred under the Treaty,N.B, -   The political situation is responsible for the non-execution of the following articles, viz:-1),     Articles 192, 195. and 193. - The unsatisfac-tory state of discipline in the ports prevented lnspec-tion of material, ships, fortifications, etc.2)*    Articles 182 and 195.   -   Unrest in the fleet prevented the sweeping of mines.
