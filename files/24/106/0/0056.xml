It is not unlikely that the railwaymen will come into line with the dockers and refuse to handle material.   This action appears entirely to be due to the agitation conducted by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.Apart from the Polish question the workers have given themselves over to enjoyment during Whitsuntide.   As an illustration of the extraordinary enthusiasm for racing it nay be mentioned that during the Doncaster Races, 12,000 men, mostly miners, booked from Mexboro&apos; in one day.The people s Russian Information Bureau, in common with Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs other organisations, is in financial difficulties.The Shop Stewards Conference at Coventry was a fiasco, only 40 people being present.The Annual Conference.of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers decided not to federate with the Labour Party; the loyal ex-Service men&apos;s organisations in South Wales have amalgamated.Klishko, the Secretary to the Russian Trading Delegation, has already broken his undertaking not to engage in political action.Harold Burgess was sentenced to 6 months1 imprisonment on May 22nd.
G LJTHE &quot;HMDS OFF RUSSIA&quot; COMMITTEEifThe &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is causing xK^naidarahlo mischief by its inoessant agitation on behalf of Soviet Russia.    On May 26th it published a faosimile of a label taken from a railway wagon at Stockport and alleged that the shells destined for Roumania were designed for use against Russia,Following upon the dockers conference to which I referred in my last report, the Executive Committee of the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain has decided to exert pressure on the Government to &quot;cease support of Polish intervention&quot;.    The officials of the National Union of Railwayman have also resolved to instruct their members to refuse to handle any material whioh is intended to assist Poland.    The oongress of the National Union of General Workers indicate^ that its members would be similarly advised.Extremists in London are devoting some attention to the Polish Legation; a demonstration was held in Grosvenor Square on May 22nd and 26th.   The Polish Envoy has, consented to receive a deputation not exceeding about 4 persons.   Among these are Lieutenant-Colosel Malone, M.P., and extremists like Ebury, Willis and Ramsay,   The British Socialist Party Is responsible for this phase of the movement.At a meeting of the London Workers1 Council on May 22nd, Lieutenant Colonel Malone, M.P., suggested to the meeting the burning down of the Polish Legation.   His remarks wore distinctly heard by two Police Officers and there can be no doubt about their purport.THE/
TBS HOUSING question the irritation caused by insufficient-Jhousing accommodation appears to be increasing and the proposal to raise rents is meeting with much opposit Peeling is especially strong.in Glasgow, where there are threats of a no-rent strike.On May 22nd about a thotisand Scottish delegates1 attended a meeting in Glasgow convened by the Scottisj Labour Housing Association.   Bailie John Wheatley presided.   A resolution was carried protesting agains the proposals to increase the rents of dwelling house by 8s. in the pound, contending that as the Governmei^: has no mandate to impose such a tyzrden on tenants they must first receive public sanction through a General Election or a referendum, and stating that if this increase is put into effect v/ithout public sanction a no-rent campaign will be at once launched, by the Executive of the Scottish Labour Housing Association.   An amendment that a 10$ increase on rent was justified was defeated. , A second resolution oalli: upon Trade Unions and other industrial organisations ti consider the question of suspending labour for 24 hours! on the opening day of the rent strike was also carried.OVBKTIMB IN THB ENGINEERING ;INDUSTRY&apos; &apos;My Coventry correspondent, who has made careful enquiries regarding the men&apos;s feeling towards a system of payment by results, states that the large majority is in favour of working overtime ,in order to earn more money.   Overtime, however, except to a very limited degree and under special circumstances is not permitted by their trade unions, and the men have frequently been, heard to denounce this attitude.   They admit that theyare/
are carried away at their meetings by the &quot;red-rag&quot; talk of their officials; every proposal put to them is carried with enthusiasm, but forgotten almost immediately the meeting is over.   They say that they would become unpopular if they differed from their leaders in publio although they do not really agree with half the measures they support.My correspondent thinks that tho engineers are at heart in favour of payment by result, but as their officials saw that they would lose much power over the men if this scheme were adopted, they persuaded them to turn the proposal down.   It is also stated that when the balloting took place recently on this question many of the men who were believed to favour payment by results were not given ballot papers.An instance of trade union tyranny occurred last week at the works of Messrs. Wilson &amp; Co., Gas Meter Manufacturers, Foleshill Road, Coventry.   Owing to pressure of orders and the difficulty in executing them in a reasonable time, this firm asked their tinsmiths to work l-J hours overtime daily until the arrears of work could be completed.   The best feeling has always existed between these employers and their workpeople and the tinsmiths willingly agreed to put in the extra time as it was much to their pecuniary advantage.   After they had worked overtime for about a week the matter came to the ears of the local branch of their trade union who gave them instructions to cease this overtime work immediately - ahd this they were obliged to do. The action of the trade union would perhaps be comprehensible if there was much local unemployment among the tinsmiths - but this is not the case.THIS/
THE MIIIERSMy correspondents report that miners all over the country contemplate a demand for increased wages as a result of the rise in the price of coal.   The matter has now been taken up by the men&apos;s officials and the Sxecutive Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain has announced that a special conference will be held in London on June 12th &quot;tp consider the relation of wages to the increasing income of the industry and to the latest increase in the cost of living as shown by the Government returns.&quot;   The Executive Committee will meet in London on June 11th to formulate proposals.It seeras likely that the wages demand will be used as a lever with which it is hoped to force the Government to continue the subsidy on domestic coal.LABOUR PAgTg ORGANISATIONIt seems clear that the Labour Party is devoting much attention to spade work in the constituencies,   A &quot;two million shillings&quot; fund has been started to meet increased expenditure, but good use is being made of the funds already at the disposal of the Party.   From the Tyneside, for instance, my correspondent writes: &quot;The propaganda of the Labour Party is far more prominent than that of any other societies and in many parts of the district they have the field to themselves.&quot;TH5 IMDSPENDMT LABOUR PARTY-The newly elected National Administrative Council of the Independent Labour Party is suspected, as was its predecessor, of making pleasant use of the Party funds. The City of London branch accuses it of taking friends-to the conferences who are not members of the IndependentLabour/
i no10 0Labour Party, paying expenses and having a good time generally at the cost of the organisation.   It is further alleged that the Council has been holding private meetings, of whioh no reports have been given.The ordinary and special meetings held during Whitsuntide have been sparsely attended as the workers preferred recreation.   In London the Herald League propagandists met with little support and some opposition and in the case of a meeting at Southwark a collection taken from some 150 people amounted to 9-jrd.THE PEOPLES HPgSUM ISiTOBKATION BUREAUThis organisation is in financial straits; salaries have not been paid for two weeks, the rent is due and no funds are available.   At the conference held on May 22nd it was stated that during the past year the bureau had &quot;raised  1,000, received  150 for affiliation fees,  330 as donations, and sold  647 worth of literature.&quot; The present stock of literature was valued at  240.Miss Sylvia Pankhurst stated at the outset of the conference, which was attended by some 45 people, that the strain was too great and that she proposed to close down the bureau.   This view Was opposed by other delegates who considered that in spite of the Russian news given by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and &quot;The Call&quot;, the bureau still had a sphere of usefulness.   It was finally agreed to add to the committee Commander Grenfell, Mr.. Robert Dell and Mrs. Despard, who would accept donations.   This decision probably indicates that the Bureau&apos;will change hands and that these three people, together with others whom they may co-opt, will accept financial responsibility.It transpired that&apos; the Bureau:had been particularlysuccessful/
successful in places such as Brighton, Willesden, Tooting and Walthamstow, where the British Socialist Party has a firm hold.   A delegate stated that in Birmingham 30 big meetings had been held and 60,000 leaflets distributed during the year.It was stated that the Bureau had lost a number of supporters whom the police raids had made nervous.One delegate wished to know why money could not be obtained from Russia, &quot;particularly as New York had a building and a paper &apos;Soviet Russia1&quot;.   Sylvia Pankhurst replied that Martens in Mew York was in direct touch with Russia but that here there was no one.   If Litvinoff were here it would be all right.   As things were, it would take too long - the money was wanted now.As a matter of fact she has received money from abroad but owing to her difference with Theodore Rothstein the supply is now cut off.SOUTH IVALBSA correspondent who has been investigatingconditions in South Wales sends the following report:&quot;Everywhere one finds indications of the workers&apos; prosperity,, not only amongst the miners, but also amongst all other classes of workers. This material prosperity is unfortunately not accompanied by satisfaction or content.   So far from high wages, short hours, and an abundance of employment having done anything to allay the hostility of these men towards employers, as employers, I am convinced that the hostility in question is more deep-seated than ever.   Ea my judgment the rank and file, the great mass of worke in South Wales are calmly and confidently waiting for some great change that they fe&amp;l cannot be long delayed.: I do not,wish to be understood as meaning that South Wales is on the verge of revolution, or is talcing active steps to prepare a revolution.   What I mean is that the workers of South Wales feel themselves absolutely masters of the situation.   They believe that a new era is beginning.   The - trouble is now mental and no longei material.   A few years ago &quot;Recognition&quot; was the magic word in Trade Union circles.   To-day it is &quot;Control&quot;.   Everywhere in South&quot;Wales men are tell the workers that they must &quot;control&quot; the industries in/
In which they are employed^   Even.amongst the miners Nationalisation of the Mines   is giving place to a cry for Control of the Mining Industry.   I have, met no one as yet who could say exactly what was meant by &quot;Control&quot;.   The nearest approach to it is heard from the members of the building trades unions, who are campaign-ing throughout the area.   They frankly ask for the extinction of the private builder and suggest that the Local Authorities should rai.se the money for houses, and that the lccj^: building trades unions should be entrusted viTith the whole of the contracts for material and men.   Others suggest that the borough surveyor should be responsible for material whilst the Union provides the men. Both stand for the elimination of the private contractor.   Higher wages are no longer regarded as a cure for nil evils.   Miners1 agents, trade union secretaries and speakers of all the various schools of socialism join with &quot;bourgeois&quot; economists in denouncing thVvicious circle round which wages chase prioes.   &quot;Control&quot;, they say. is the only remedy.In South Wales allowance must be made for the extreme youth of many of the workers.   Many of the youngsters who call themselves Bolsheviks are merely working off their surplus energy.In spite of this fact there is a decided tendency towards the Soviet system.   In the mining valleys men openly declare that every Miners1 Lodge should fit itself to take over and run the mine in which its members are employed.   There is also a brotherhood of Soviets whose aim is to federate all the local organisations.   In Newport, Cardiff, Swansea and Bristol nightly one hears men advocate the adoption of the Soviet system for Great Britain.This time last year the,Welsh miners relied entirely upon themselves. ,&apos;They considered them-selves quite powerful enough to achieve Nationalisation unaided.   This year they talk of the necessity of all Labour organisations co-operating in order to obtain &quot;Control&quot;,   This is the more remarkable when it is remembered that the majority of Welsh miners live in isolated communities, and rarely mix&apos;with any save fellow-miners.I have never yet heard a miner admjt that he receives more than 3s. 4d* per ton for* cutting coal.   If the colliery officials could arrange to have put on the menls pay tickets, opposite the amount of money they are to receive, the total amount of coal dug for the money, they might be got to realise how much they do get per,ton for cutting the ooal.COVENTRY SHOP STEWARDS CONFERENCEOn May 23rd a conference convened by theCoventry Engineering Shop Stewards was held at theCoin/
Corn Exchange, Coventry.The meeting was a complete fiasco owing to the small attendance of about 40, but the warmth of the weather communicated itself to the speakers and bad humour was displayed throughout the meeting.   There &apos; was the usual talk of seizing control of the work-shops and the apathy of Trade Unions, but it waslsignificant that, although most of the people presenl belonged to the Left Wing of the Trade Union movement, the extremists&apos; speeches provoked op posit iJ It was admitted that the Shop Steward movement in Coventry was dead and that not one in twenty of the Coventry workmen was in favour of revolution.   In the evening Arthur Mollanus made a violent speeoh in the market place to an audience of some sixty personf of whom many were hostile critics.TH3 POL IPS STRIKERSOn May 25th the premises of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers at Liverpool were raidi by the Liverpool City Police. V/. B, Smethwiok, Smitl R. Tissyman and G. Lewis were arrested and charged with publishing a proposal or scheme for the sale of tickets for an unauthorised lottery. 10,000 tickets were seized on the premises and tickets were found oi all the defendants, who were subsequently remanded for eight days on bail of  20 in each case.3x-Sergeant Tissyman addressed a meeting held under&apos;the auspices of the National Union of Polioe and Prison Officers (Liverpool branch) at Birkenheed on May 22nd.   He made the usual attack on the Government treatment of the strikers, but stated that the local Watch Committee would probablyreinstate/
reinstate them before the next municipal elections.In London, the strikers continue to hold meetings but there is a notable decrease in the attendance.   They base their hopes of reinstatement upon a Labour Government.   On May 83rd the Ryde Park demonstration was addressed from three platforms in the usual strain; the procession numbered only about 300.A correspondent states that in South V.&apos;ales, particularly in the Merthyr Tydfil area, there is agitation amongst the police for an increment of 10s. v/eekly..THE NATIONAL LBAGUiS OF THIS BLINDThe League is still endeavouring to focus public attention on the position of blinded men in this country. On May 22nd a demonstration was held at Liverpool and a flag day on behalf of the blind was organised in that city.   The procession was escorted through the streets by boy scouts and a speaker stated that there were 250 blind men trying to live on 10s. a week in Manchester; 200 in Liverpool; 150 in Birmingham; 100 in Blackburn and 650 blind beggars in London.   He urged that those able to work should be given employment and that the remainder   should be given an adequate pension.RUSSIAN TRADING DELEGATIONMembers of the Russian Trading Delegation, except Krassin, who elected to be bound by an honourable undertaking, have all signed promises to abstain from interference in political questions in this country. Klishko, who is acting as Secretary, has already broken his undertaking.   It is believed that Krassin himself may be trusted but there is definite evidence that Koginand/
and Rosovsky, to say nothing of the others, have agreed to get into touch with the Sinn Fein organisatil if an opportunity ocours.HAROLD BURGESSOn May 22nd Harold Burgess, to whose case I refer! in my last report, was sentenced to 6 months1 imprison! without hard labour.SIM FEIN IB, GREAT BRITAIN IA rumour is current in London Sinn Fein circles to the effect that Sean McGrath is to be superseded, al the Central Executive of the Irish Self-Determination 1 League do not consider the progress of the League      I satisfactory.   It is stated that some of the hunger strikers from Wormwood Scrubs intend to visit industri centres for propaganda purposes.The North London branch of the League proposes to hold open air meetings in the Paddington district during; the summer.On May 22nd a Sinn Fein meeting in Chandos Hall vfl well attended and it is said that over  16 was taken a the door, the price of admission being 2s.The Merthyr Tydfil branch of the Irish Self-Determination League has been reorganised and now has membership of about 300.   Efforts are also being made reorganise the Dowlais branch, which has only 100 development) from a population of about 2,000 Irish people.On May 23rd the Irish in Leeds numbering about 1,1 marched in procession round the city with a pipers&apos; bej A meeting was then held at Woodhouse Moor; the chair taken by Father Cody, a local priest, and the speakersincluded/
included P.J. Kelly of Liverpool, Sean Melroy, Sinn Fein fol.Pt, and Sean McGrath. who has been speaking in South Wales recently.   They attacked the Labour Party and it was noticeable that the general public inoluding trade unionists and Labour people remained aloof.ireland there was no improvement in the condition of the Provinces during the past week - large tracts of the country remained practically in a state of anarchy.   Up to Hay 22nd, 187 indictable offences had been reported, not including 24 cases of burning vacated police barracks and Court Bouses, four attacks on Excise Offices and 60 cattle drives.     There were four cases of murder.Notices were found posted in Co. Limerick that if compensation is claimed for a Royal Irish Constabulary Barrack destroyed the claimant will be a marked man.   On 17th instant traders in Doon (Co. Limerick) received notices warning them against supplying the police with goods.Efforts continue to be made by Sinn Fein to break down the discipline and morale of the Royal Irish Constabulary.A joint meeting of the Sinn Fein Executive of North and South Roscommon was held at Roecommon on 9th instant to consider the land&quot; agitation in the county and an official statement was issued.&quot;Old Ireland&quot; and &quot;The Watchword of Labour&quot; appeared during the week.There is no change in the Labour situation, and during the week strikes took place at Omagh and Cork City.Dockers having refused to discharge cargoes ofmilitary stores and motors, etc, at North Wall andKingstown respectively during the week the work ofunloading/
- IE -unloading had to he carried out by the military. Twenty waggons of Military Stores for Cork have been held up at Kingstown owing to engine drivers refusing to take their trains there.   These drivers state thej acted on instructions of their Union (National Union of railwaymen).   The attitude of this Union appears to he that no munitions for Ireland are to be handled, by their members.
