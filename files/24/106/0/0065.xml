^^Jj ^ THE CABINET.INCIDENCE OP THE COST OF TROOPS IN SOUTH and east PERSIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate below to my colleagues a letter which I have addressed to the Secretary of State for India on the incidence of the cost of troops in South and East Persia.0162 346The War Office,29th May, 1920.w. s. c.My dear Secretary of State for India, 28th May, 1920.&quot; I have seen the Viceroy&apos;s telegram No. 6066 of the 13th instant^ saying he can give no guarantee to reduce the period of five months estimated to be required to ftZ, withdraw the troops from East Persia. As I believe you are aware, I have only taken a sum of 2,000,000/. in Army Estimates for the current year to cover all charges for troops in South and East Persia. Of course I hold with the Treasury view that the cost of the troops in East Persia is properly one for division between the Indian and Imperial Revenues in equal shares, the Imperial share falling on Foreign Office Votes, and I understand that this matter is still under official discussion between your office and the Treasury; but, in case this view is not upheld, I must warn you that I cannot agree to bear any additional charge on Army Funds in excess of the provision made in my Estimates, and I must stipulate that any excess due to the time taken in the withdrawal of these troops from East Persia must fall on Indian revenues. I am circulating a copy of this letter to the Cabinet.Yours sincerely, (Signed)     Winston S. Churchill.The Right Hon. The Secretary of State for India.it&apos;SECRET.
