Referred to Committee of Home Affairs(This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1s Government).I submit ror the decision of tho Cabinet a:proposal that the vocational training of women which is due to terminate on June 30th shall be continued for a further     &apos;    -period.The vocational training of women who at the termination of hostilities were thrown out of employment in the Munition Factories or other kinds of war work, was sanctioned by the Treasury in Kay, .1919, and has been extended from time to time to meet the needs of the women r;jhose discharge from the Rotten1s Corps, Government Offices and other work was delayed.    June 30th was fixed by the Treasury on December 17th as the final date for closing down the training.Urgent representations have been made against this decision by and on behalf of the women themselves and resolu-tiona have beer- received from the VIomen&apos;s ?ub-Oomm.1 tte-es of the Local Employment Committees throughout the country, and from Women&apos;s Organisations including the National Federation of Women Workers and the FomenTs Industrial League.   ?ir Robert Rome after   giving careful consideration to the matter with hi* advisers decided to press for the training to be. continued until the end of the year, but left.the Department before effect could be given to his view.    On becoming Minister of Labour, I found myself in complete accord with Sir Robert Home and consulted the Treasury who, however, refused to reverse the decision given in December.   Meanwhile, the demand from the women increased in volume and urgency, and the case of the demobilised clerks In Army Pay, Pensions, I &quot;unitions and other Government Departments has beenVOCATIONAL TRAINING OF WOMEN.PKCRFT 07^.1367.Kemoranflum by.the Ministry of Labour.cons id ereu
considered by the Sub-Committee of the National -hitley Council appointed to inquire into the position of temporary staffs in the Civil Service, who recommended that women discharged from Government Officen should be assisted to take full advantage of the facilities afforded by the existing schemes of training. Hundreds of these young women are to be discharged in the next few months and are now askinr through their ^taff Organisations for opportunities of vocational training, such as those discharged earlier have enjoyed.The need for a further extension of the period of training does not, however, depend on the demobilisation of Government clerks, but arises out of the unemployment which still persists among former war workers.   The reduction in the official figures of unemployed women on the live   register of the Employment Exchanges as shown in the following table is more apparent than real - the women have to a considerable extent ceased to register for employment, having found by experience that they are unsuited for the vacancies offered to them, being altogether unskilled in women1 s normal trades and processes.Statement shewing the numbers on the Live   Register (Women) from November, 1919 to May, 1920. -United Kingdom.

t9^1?&amp; to UThe vacancies now registered at the Employment Exchanges are chiefly for skilled or semi-skilled workers, such as the women would have by now become, had they been en-aged in peace-time work instead of war work.   It is to enable these women to become employable that the continuation of the training schemes of the Iw.ir.is try of La&apos; our is urged.The cost of the continuance of the Training would be small. The Government will by the 30th June not have spent mere than  210,000, against tho maximum of  25u,000 stipulated by the Treasury when the present extension was agreed upon, and while it is not possible at the moment to r-ivo any precise estimate of&apos;the cost of an extension on the lines proposed arove, it should not exceed  200,000.   In my judgement the total of  410,000 would not be a large sum for the Government to have spent in training women when compared with the sums provided for the training of ex-service officers and men.   The initial expense of establishing training centres has been incurred and their continued maintenance would add comparatively little to the expenditure.   They would afford accommodation for the najority of the women needing industrial training in technical classes.      Further development of the use of employers&apos; factories and workshops for the purpose of intensive training is anticipated if the period of training were extended and this would meet a large proportion of the demand for training facilities.,   iiany offers have lately been made to the Department by large firms who are prepared to accept women for training In their factories under similar conditions to those already sanctioned by the Treasury.   These have had to be refused because of the early date for the termination of the training schemes. Such training by employers assists tho development of new industries and the absorption of a large number of women workers.Examples/
9 O piExamples of this kind of training and of its results are afforded   by tho Wholesale Tailoring schemes in Rotherham, Sheffield, and Castleford and in the Hosiery Trade in Scotland.The Government is already pledged to continue for some time longer the training of War widows and Disabled Nurses under the powers taken over from the Ministry of Pensions last autumn and, therefore, it will be necessary in any case to maintain an organisation at Headquarters and in the country todeal with these cases0   Much of tho training given undbr the Royal Warrant to widows and disabled nurses is arranged on the same method as that of the unemployed women, and I recommend strongly that the administration of the whole of the womanrs training should be continued until the exceptional necessities created by tho war have ccme %o an end.   My expectation is that in this matter conditions will have become normal in six months&apos; time,In view of the early date at which training is to ^e-&apos;-^ni^ under^xistingM grrangevents, I ask for a, very early Acs is 1.on,(Signed) T.
