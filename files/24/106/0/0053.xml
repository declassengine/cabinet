Notes from the British Military Mission, Paris, to the Director ofMilitary Intelligence, War Office.1.(L.S.O. 3964.) 21st May, 1920.Extract from a despatch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Paris,dated the 18 th May.&quot; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers it would be unwise to allow Damad Ferid&apos;s Government to organize armed forces with the assistance of the British authorities. It considers that the effect would be that these troops destined in principle to fight the Nationalists would most probably go over to them and become a serious danger for the Allied troops in the Levant.&quot;E. L. Spears, Brigadier-General,General Staff.2.(L.S.O. 3965.) 21st May, 1920.General Gouraud reports from Beirut on the 19th May : &quot; The situation is getting worse in Cilicia. Attacks from various Kemalist bands are of daily occurrence and our posts have been reduced in strength owing to men having to be taken from them to form a column which is being sent to the assistance of Bozanti.&quot;Deville&apos;s Column was not able to reach Aintab and had to fight its way back to Killis. In view of this General de Lamotte has recalled BieuvreV Column. The situation in the Tartus District is stationary. A Column (Nieger) is being assembled at Tyre to carry out reprisals for the recent massacres.&quot; The present effectives in Syria are quite insufficient to ward off any blow in force, and the despatch there of 12 battalions from the Army of the Levant is a matter of urgency.&quot;E. L. Spears, Brigadier-General,General Staff.
