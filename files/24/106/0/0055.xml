Nil.Part II. Departmental.The National Scheme for the Employment of Disabled Men. *The National Scheme for the employment of disabled men on a percentage basis continues to make progress, but at a comparatively slow rate. On the 5th November, 1919, approximately two months after the scheme was instituted, the number of employers who had given undertakings in accordance with the provisions of the scheme slightly exceeded 9,000, and the number of workpeople on whom the proportion of disabled men was to be calculated was approximately a million and a quarter. By the 23rd March,. 1920, after 20 weeks had elapsed, the number of employers had risen only to 13,235 and the total number of employees in the firms concerned considerably exceeded 2,000,000. A special canvass was then instituted which will be brought to a close at the end of May. During the six weeks ending the 7th May, the rate of progress has nearly been doubled. By the 17th May the number of employers to whom certificates have been issued had been raised to 16,800, and the number of employees increased to 2,481,559. Provision has thus been made under the scheme for 145,112 disabled men, of whom 5,436 have still to be engaged.(0 2003)  150  5/20 H &amp; S 2 G
The special live register for disabled men at the Exchanges is still falling. But the decline is hardly sufficient to indicate that the scheme will be brought to a successful issue by the end of May. The latest figures available, those for the 7th May, show a total of slightly over 20,400 disabled men registered by the Exchanges. The improvement which has been produced in the general position, largely by the operation of the scheme, may be measured to some extent from the fact that on the 8th August, 1919, a little over 40,000 disabled men were on the Exchange registers, but that the improvement is inclined to be slow is shown by the fact that during the month ending the 7th April a reduction of less than 3,000 was effected in the total of disabled men still to be placed, and in the month ending the 7th May, a reduction of only 1,300. The fall in the live register, of course, does not completely represent the effects which the scheme has produced, for during the interval over 100,000 disabled men have passed through the Exchanges of whom a great number have no doubt found employment in consequence of the scheme.The future of the scheme is at present under inquiry. Two points especially call for comment. In the first place, the share of the burden taken by local authorities has by no means fulfilled the promise of the early days of the scheme. A substantial number of these bodies have, indeed, accepted the scheme, and have in some cases gone so far as to insist that all firms receiving contracts under their authority shall have given an undertaking to observe the scheme. But there is still a wide field in which the scheme has not yet been accepted, and special efforts will have to be made to bring all local authorities into line. In the second place, the question has again been raised in the House of Commons as to whether the time has not come for the Government to insist that the list of Government contractors shall now be confined to the firms whose names appear on the National Roll. It may be hoped that the problem of disabled men may still be solved without recourse to any measure of compulsion. The fact remains, how-ever, that after nearly nine months of systematic canvassing and propaganda, the efforts of the Ministry have only reduced the live register of disabled men by half.Part III. The Labour and Socialist Press. Topics of Discussion.The number of noteworthy articles in the Labour and Social Press is no greater this week than it was last week. The movement in the main subjects of discussion is perhaps the most important fact to record. A fortnight&apos;ago there seemed every.prospect of a bitter campaign in these papers inspired by the subject of &quot; high prices.&quot; But this campaign has not been realised, and, in place of the question of prices, the principal topics * of discussion are Ireland and the Russo-Polish war. The change of emphasis shows how much the Labour and Socialist Press is conditioned by what the Independent Labour Party terms its international outlook. An illustration of the results of this tendency may be seen in the fact that the leaders of the I.L.P. now insist that the problem of high prices must to a large extent be solved by increased production, and are not prepared to let the solution of this problem wait upon the advent of a Labour Government to power. This development in their attitude may be attributed almost entirely to their concern for the condition of Central Europe.Foreign Affairs.. With regard to the renewal of active operations between the Polish and Russian Governments, as a general rule to which the exceptions are few the Labour and Socialist Press believe that the British Government is involved. There is a difference of opinion as to the extent to which it is implicated ; while the more extreme papers believe that the Polish Government is the mere agent of France and the United Kingdom, the more moderate opinion is that it was the duty of the League of Nations to restrain the Poles, and that the failure of the League to take this matter into consideration must be attributed to the favour with which the principal Allied Govern-ments are held to regard Polish policy. The reaction of this Polish question upon the internal Labour situation is the important thing, and it is here that the differences of opinion appear in these papers. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; declares that the Polish situation justifies &quot; direct action &quot; in this country, and approves of the action of some London dockers in refusing to touch munitions consigned to the Polish Govern-ment. In a leading article, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; connects the two questions of Ireland and Poland. &quot; In both cases the Government are pursuing a policy of interfering with the right of a people to determine their own government.&quot;  It may be observed that
-       4 O10(C 2003)* pp. 230, 232.2G2dockers and railwaymen in various parts of Ireland and dockers at Avonmouth have already arrived at the conclusion that if it is right to interrupt the shipment of munitions to Poland, it is equally proper to interrupt the conveyance of military stores to Ireland. &quot; The Call,&quot; the organ of the B.S.P., is in reality less concerned with the rights of self-determination, but rejoices in the hope that direct action in its interests may bring to birth the &quot; revolutionary crisis&quot; in this country, and, in due preparation for this crisis, publishes attacks from the pens of Messrs. Willis and McLaine upon the political and industrial leaders of Trade Unionism for sharing with the Government responsibility for the Polish offensive. The &quot; Nation &quot; thinks that the refusal to load the &quot; Jolly George &quot; may be &quot; the beginning of a revolt which will startle Westminster.&quot;Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; New Age,&quot; all comment on the failure of the strike move-ment initiated by the Confederation Generate du Travail on the 1st May. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; makes disparaging remarks about French, as compared with British, trade unionism. The I.L.P. writers, however, think that British Labour itself can learn from the French strike a valuable lesson on the fatal results of weak organisation, poor inteili-gence service, and precipitate action. The &quot; New Age&quot; is very critical of the programme the C.G.T. put forward, and regrets that &quot; Socialists can so seldom resist the temptation to exploit a public situation in the interests of some traditional formula.&quot; This paper thinks that it would have been better for the C.G.T. to have kept itself to the problem of reducing prices.It may be noted that the more important I.L.P. writers Mr. Philip Snowden, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, and &quot; Rob Roy &quot; observe with regret the resignation of Signor Nitti. The Italian ex-Prime Minister won remarkable popularity in the I.L.P. papers and the &quot; Nation &quot; at the time of the London conference of the Supreme Allied Council, and has retained their affection. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, too, makes favourable mention of Signor Giolitti. .Government Policy.The absence of noteworthy comment on the question of high prices has already been observed. It is remarkable in view of the fact that the recent increase in the general level of retail prices is the immediate result of Government decisions on policy-that what discussion there is, is devoted to the consideration of the &quot; vicious circle &quot; and to insistence upon the fact that mere demands for increased wages to meet increased prices will not meet the situation. A leading article in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; contains the characteristic suggestion that &quot; peace abroad is a precedent condition of contentment and prosperity at home.&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; discusses the Triple Alliance movement on this question, and is profoundly sceptical of its value. &quot; It is a platform campaign with no set objective beyond that of troubling the waters.&quot; The Labour movement has hitherto clung to a belief in nationalisation, extended control, and Government subsidies as the means of reducing the cost of living, and the opinion of the &quot; New Age &quot; may be regarded as sub-stantially correct that some other policy must be discovered and adopted, if the leaders of Labour are to succeed in their double task of transforming both Government policy in regard to prices and trade union policy in regard to wages. It may be noted that the&apos; passing into law of the Profiteering Amendment Bill receives no comment.&quot; Justice &quot; contains an interview with Mi-. George Hicks, Secretary of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society, on the supply of labour for housing purposes. Mr Hicks recapitu-lates the arguments which the operatives are bringing forward to show that there is no need for dilution, and expresses the opinion that what is really needed to improve the position is a guarantee to the operatives that they will not lose money, when employed on housing schemes, from short time resulting either from bad weather or from shortage of materials. He shows marked approval of the direct Labour scheme which is being put into operation at Newbury, and alleges that this scheme has been unduly delayed by the Ministry of Health. In his remarks on the Manchester Building Guild scheme it is note-worthy that he makes no clear distinction between it and &quot; direct labour.&quot;The Trade Union Movement.The predominant feature of the &quot; Railway Review &quot; this week is the expression of satisfaction, both in a leading, and in a special, article with the results of the official national conferences of railway shopmen and signalmen to which attention was drawn in this Report last week.*  The leading article declares that the &quot; scheme of organisation adopted
by the shopmen is a challenge to the craft idea of Trade Unionism &quot;; the fact that this conference endorsed the national wages movement for railway shopmen, as opposed to district movements, is regarded as equally important. In a special article, Mr. J. Eggle-stone concludes that the signalmen&apos;s conference has been justified, in that it has &quot; brought under the official wing a large amount of energy and enthusiasm which was being expended in an unofficial direction.&quot;The Trade Union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; makes interesting remarks on two topics : Trade union conferences and the Building Guild. On the former subject he criticises present trade union delegate meetings for their infrequency and their corn-position. He thinks that delegate meetings should be held on every occasion throughout the year when a large issue of policy has to be decided ; and that these meetings should consist &quot; mainly of men coining from the bench or workshop,&quot; chosen in the shortest possible time. He does not stop to consider the practicability of these ideas. In his review of Building Guild schemes, he makes three points ; that Guild schemes of this kind cannot be applied to heavily capitalised industries, that they are not very different from &quot; direct labour &quot; schemes, and that the present opening in the building industry for such experiments is only of a temporary character. This cool discussion of the Building Guild plan may be contrasted with the enthusiasm with which the plan was received in these papers on its inception.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; makes some remarks on the &quot; General Staff &quot; for Labour which was again under consideration last week at the headquarters of the Labour Party and Trade Union movement. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; believes that such a &quot; General Staff &quot; to form not only the supreme executive, but also the supreme judicial authority of the movement, is urgently necessary. But this paper fears that in constructing this machinery the Trade Union leaders may rely top much on form and too little on spirit. It is pointed out that it will be very difficult to get the trade unions to take their orders as to industrial movements from a central body ; and the conclusion arrived at is that the &quot; General Staff &quot; must show what work it is capable of before it may be entrusted with authority, that it must win its authority by putting forward ideas and policy of such a kind as will receive favour from the movement, as a whole. The work at present being done by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, for dock labour and &apos;busmen, and by the National Federation of General Workers for gas workers, is quoted as an example of tlie way in which bodies with Very little constitutional authority do gain real power in&apos;-Trade Unionism.. This article is significant for an admission with regard to the mines nationalization campaign; &quot; the mines for the nation campaign broke down because it. was not based on clear principles and because little effort was made to get its real implications widely understood.&quot;The Socialist Movement.Mr. J. Penny, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; deal briefly with the proposals which are being put before the Co-operative Congress at Bristol for the formation of a triple political alliance between the Co-operative movement, the Trades Union Congress, and the Labour Party. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; points out to those co-operative critics who fear that this will result in the absorption of political co-operation by the Labour Party, that without some definite arrangement with the Labour Party, a Co-operative Party has no,chance of achieving any political success. Mr. Penny sees no reason why amalgamation between the co-operatives and the Labour movement should not take place. The present proposal, he fears, may result in friction rather than harmony. But his chief objection to the scheme is to the admission of the Trades Union Congress to the proposed alliance. The Trade Union Congress, he declares, has no part in politics ; &quot; the Labour Party is the political expression of Trade Union activity.&quot; It may be observed that this scheme of alliance is taken too seriously in these two papers. It is an electoral scheme, rather than political; the interest of the Co-operative movement in politics is not so much that they should return members to Parliament and share in the Parliamentary successes of the Labour Party, but that their mercantile and industrial organisation should be chosen as the proper instrument of Labour Government policy, in carrying through a policy of socialisation. In this respect their position is similar to the trade unions, and Mr. Penny should also know that in an alliance of these three bodies the function of Trade Unions is to act as cement. The members of Trade Unions, as individual householders, form the bulk of the membership of co-operative societies ; while, through the affiliation of the unions to the Labour Party, they support the most important body in this country inspired by Socialist ideals.
Part IV.-General Topics.General Survey of the Week.The industrial situation during the week, so far as disputes are concerned, has been remarkably quiet, owing perhaps to the influence of the Whitsuntide holidays. In the near future, however, there are several important issues which may lead to a crisis. The attitude of certain of the Transport Unions towards the conveyance of certain stores to Ireland may conceivably cause a difficult situation. The National Wages Board, which has been considering the claims put forward by the National Union of Railwaymen and the A.S.L.E. and F. for increased wages will resume its sittings on Thursday, the 27th inst., and in this connection it should be noted that in accordance with the terms of the January Railway Agreement, the railwaymen have power to take strike action after June 4th. On June 3rd the National Federation of General Workers will consider the result of the ballot of gas workers, which has been taken throughout the country, and which, it is anticipated, will show an overwhelming majority in favour of a strike. On the 1st June the National Conciliation Board for the Building Trade will again have to consider the demands of the operatives for the institution of national wages rates.The decision of the Executive of the M.F.G.B. to call a special National Conference of the M.F.G.B. for June 12th, to consider the question of putting forward another wages demand as a result of the increase in coal prices, is dealt with below. The first practical decision on the relative merits of a general Labour campaign for a reduction of the cost of living, and of a&apos;separate wages movements by the various trade union bodies, will therefore probably be made by the miners.The Whitsuntide week-end has, as usual, been notable for the holding of the periodic conferences of a number of trade unions, friendly societies, and of the Co-operative Con-gress. The important feature of the Co-operative Congress is the consideration of pro-posals for a political alliance between the Co-operative body and the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress. With regard to the conferences of the greater trade unions, it may be noted that a large part of their proceedings has been devoted to the consideration of political questions in particular, the war between Poland and Russia, and the state of affairs in Ireland.The Unemployment Position.The number of H.M. Forces policies current for the week ended the 14th May, 1920, was 206,905 (205,265 lodged by men and 1,640 by women). There were, in addition, 12,658 policies (12,545 men&apos;s and 113 women&apos;s) upon which payment had been made during the week, but which were not current at the end of the week. The previous week, the 7th May, there were 208,412 policies current (206,650 men&apos;s and 1,762 women&apos;s) and 12,345 (12,222 men&apos;s and 123 womens) upon which payment had been made during the week.67,557 unemployment books (44,333 by males and 23,224 by females) remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 14th May, 1920, making an increase of 993 since the 7th May. At the latter date 43,310 books were lodged by males and 23,254 by females (a total of 66,564).At the 7th May,&apos; 65 policies remained lodged by Short Time Workers, of which 42 were in the insured group (92-8 per cent, being in the Engineering and Ironfouncling Group) and 23 in the uninsured. At the previous week, ending the 30th April, 101 Short Time Policies remained lodged, and 141 a month ago.The total live register at all Employment Exchanges at the week ended the 14th May was: 273,772 men, 48,529 women, 23,076 juveniles, compared with 275,926 men, 48,443 women, 23,935 juveniles, a week ago (the 7th May) and 286,342 men, 48,641 women, 26,479 juveniles a month ago.Labour and Ireland.Attention has been drawn above to the prominence of the Irish and Russian questions at the more important Whitsuntide trade union Conferences. This has been especially noticeable at the conferences of the two dockers&apos; unions The Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union, and the National Union of Dock Labourers. At both these conferences resolutions were passed calling for the withdrawal of all troops from Ireland. &apos; The resolution of the former union was adopted on Wednesday, the 19th inst., and the impression appears to have been created in iJublin that this Union had pledged itself to(C 2003) 2 G 3
stop the conveyance of war materials to Ireland ; and on Friday 21st dockers in Dublin refused to unload a ship which contained some War Department material. This vessel was unloaded by troops. A vessel containing similar material was unloaded by troops at Kingstown on Saturday and Sunday, the 22nd and 23rd, and on the Sunday two enginemen, members of the N.U.R., refused to touch the train on to which the material had been loaded. At the North Wall Station, Dublin, on Tuesday the 25th, all the railwaymen stopped work to enforce their objection to handling consignments of revolvers for the Royal Irish Constabulary under the surveillance of an armed guard, and this stoppage continued on the Wednesday.It may be observed that these movements have so far been unofficial in character, but the official Labour support and congratulations which have been given to the move-ment for refusing to touch Polish munitions must react upon the situation with regard to Ireland, and the opportunities for Trade Union action with regard to Ireland are much greater than they are with regard to Poland. On the other hand the opponents of industrial action for political ends have recently been gaining ground. Until Wednesday, the 26th May, the trouble had been confined to the other side of the Irish Sea, where the employment of troops appears to have been a contributory cause to the more serious stoppages, but the holding up of three vessels at Avonmouth has since been reported. The Executive of the N.U.R. decided on the 21st May to ask for a full joint delegate meeting of the constituent bodies of the Triple Alliance to discuss the Irish situation. The N.U.R. Executive will deal with the position at Kingstown and North Wall, Dublin, on Thursday, the 27th inst., in so far as this concerns their own members. The whole incident is one more example of the new kinds of power which highly developed organisation has put into the hands of certain sections of labour.The Cost of Living.The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress considered on the 19th t May the communication from the Triple Alliance on the cost of living, and decided that the Labour Party and the Co-operative Movement should be consulted with a view to setting up a special committee of enquiry. The special committee will be asked to investigate the cause of high prices and to discuss ways and means of bringing down the cost of living. The suggestion is also made that the special committee shall contain representatives of the principal industrial federations, such as those of the transport workers, engineering and shipbuilding workers, and general workers.44t-Hour Week.At the annual conference of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation at Plymouth recently it was decided to recommend that the enquiry into the operation of the 44-hour week be abandoned, and that a conference of the federation and the other trades concerned should be called within a fortnight to decide on a further course of action. It was also decided to recommend the affiliated executives either to limit rigidly, or to stop altogether, overtime until the 44-hour week is conceded. Mr. J. Hill, General Secretary of the Boiler Makers. Society, continues to refer to indications of the coming slump in shipbuilding, and maintains that if the workers fail to secure the 44-hour week this summer they will never obtain it.Housing.Messrs. Bradshaw, Hicks, and Strong, of the National Building Labourers&apos; Society, have prepared a report with regard to the supply of labour for housing schemes. The report contains recommendations with regard to building trade disputes, and it is laid down that the necessary labour can be supplied provided that a full week of 44 hours is guaranteed to all building trades operatives engaged in housing schemes, that the machinery of the operatives&apos; unions should be used for supplying the ascertained deficiencies of labour for schemes, and that the local authorities and employees should co-operate in order to strengthen the regulations governing restriction of luxury building.Coal Industry.The Executive Committee of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, which met at Southport on the 21st May, decided to convene a special conference of the Federation in London on the 12th June to consider the relation of wages to the increasing income of the industry, and the latest increase in the cost of living.  The miners&apos; leaders are stated to
-j 0 *) x 0 OThe Co-operative Congress.The annual Co-operative Congress began at Bristol on the 24th May. In his pre-sidential address the Rev. G. A. Ramsay emphasised the fact that in accordance with the recommendations of the General Co-operative Survey Committee adopted at the Special Blackpool Conference, the official purpose of their meeting was the establishment of a co-operative commonwealth. They refused to accept competition and private capitalism as the best final  system, of social and industrial organization. The establishment of a co-operative commonwealth was the ultimate objective of the Labour Party and also the ultimate industrial objective of the trade unions. That identity of purpose was bringing the three movements together.The most important item on the agenda of this Congress is a proposal for the setting up of a joint body representative of the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress and the Co-operative Movement to co-ordinate the political and electoral activities of these bodies. The decision on this resolution has been postponed until next year&apos;s Congress, but the President&apos;s remarks in connection with this matter are of interest: The days were not far distant when the Labour Party would be in possession of political power : then the co-operative purpose would be the Labour Party programme, their principles would be the Labour Party policy, and co-operative organization would be the machine through which the Labour Party must express their will.Amalgamated Engineering Union.The scheme for the Engineering Trades Union Amalgamation is nearing completion and the Amalgamated Engineering Union will come formally into existence on the 1st July.   It will cover roughly 460,000 members, and will possess  4,000,000 in funds.The eleven societies amalgamating are : the A.S.E.; the Steam Enginemakers&apos; Society ; the Amalgamated Society of General Toolmakers; the United Machine Workers&apos; Association ; the Amalgamated Instrument Makers&apos; Society; the U.K. Society of Smiths and Strikers; the Associated Brassfounders, Turners; the Fitters, finishers, etc. ; the East of Scotland Brassfounders ; the North of England Brass Turners, Fitters, etc.; the Dublin Brass founders; the London United Metal Turners, Fitters and Finishers. Of these the A.S.E., with 320,000 members, is by far the-largest.The rules of the new organization have now been finally approved, and will differ in important respects from those of the old A.S.E. The skeleton of the old A.S.E. con-stitution the full time executive and the comparatively powerful district committee  is retained, but it is robbed of its rigidity, and provision is made for ensuring a control emanating directly from the rank and file, by the erection of second and controlling set of local and national bodies.The district committees continue to control their own local industrial policy, but above the district committee is placed the divisional committee. The United Kingdom is divided into 26 divisions, and a committee is to be appointed for each, consisting of two representatives from each district in the division, with the organising district delegate as secretary.The divisional committees each appoint two representatives to a National Committee which controls the full time executive and has power also to call, if necessary, a National Conference consisting of all the members of the divisional committees.An attempt has been made to safeguard sectional interests. The district committees are empowered to set-up trade committees to look after the interests of any particular section, and regard is paid to getting each section duly represented on the district com-mittee. It is proposed also to establish special machinery for dealing with dockyards, railway shops and other special sections of the membership.The powers of the shop stewards are considerably extended, and provision is made for organization based on the workshop to exist side by side with that based on the branch under the control of the district committee.be of opinion that the subsidy on industrial coal has been exploited for profiteering by manufacturers in industries in which coal largely enters, and that consumers have been deprived of any benefit in the prices of commodities. They, therefore, have no objection to industrial coal being sold at its economic price, but concentrate their criticism on the abolition of the very much greater subsidy on domestic coal. This decision of the Executive of the M.F.G.B. followed on resolutions from the South Wales, Northumberland and Scottish miners in favour of further wages demands.
The new Amalgamated Engineering Union will, therefore, provide a new model in trade union organization comparable in importance to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and the National Union of Railwaymen. If- its organization appears complex and in places redundant, it may be observed that the N.U.R. has found that great difficulties attend undue simplification of trade union machinery. If it is found workable, the new amalgamation will greatly increase the power of the engineering unions, and it is possible that it might make more intense the struggle between them and the N.U.R. for the membership of railway shopmen.Railway Clerks&apos; Association.The Twenty-second Annual Conference of this Association began at Scarborough on the 17th May. Mr. T. H! Gill, in his presidential address, maintained that higher wages would not solve economic problems, and stated that railway clerks desired a higher standard of life. He welcomed the proposal that the Labour Party, the Trades Union Congress, and the Co-operative Movement should set up a Committee to investigate the causes of high prices. The Conference passed resolutions to the effect that the complete emancipa-tion of labour was attainable only by means both of political and industrial action, and in favour of nationalisation of the mines. The Conference also called for legislation to recognise Trade Unions as the most satisfactory bodies for dealing with the whole question of unemployment. Some discussion took place on a motion that a ballot vote, showing a two-thirds majority in favour of a strike, should precede all declarations of strikes. The motion was opposed by the Executive on the ground that the present method of calling a special Delegate Conference on matters of urgency was to be preferred to the ballot procedure. The motion was defeated by a very large majority. The Conference further instructed the Executive to prepare immediately a demand for standardisation of con-ditions, minimum hours, and holidays, and to review at an early date general salary con-ditions. The Conference also declared itself opposed to the principle of a sliding scale of salaries based on the cost of living, and instructed the Executive not to accept any agreement containing this principle. An important scheme for a modification of the composition of the executive committee of the union was adopted in order to provide for definite representation on the committee of stationmasters, agents, instructors, and supervisory and technical staffs.Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union.The triennial Conference of this Union began at Plymouth on the 19th May. At the first day&apos;s session much time was devoted to discussion of a resolution declaring the sympathy of the meeting with the demand for self-government for Ireland. A resolution was passed deploring the present use of the armed forces of the Crown in Ireland, and calling for their withdrawal within six months. The Conference unanimously decided to have nothing to do with the Unemployment Insurance Bill, if insurance companies and friendly societies were allowed to administer it. The Conference also discussed anomalies existing under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, and adopted a resolution calling upon the Government to provide an early opportunity for the consideration of an amending Bill. Mr. Ben Tillett supported a motion regretting that effect had not been given to the vital principle of the League of Nations for the prevention of war. The Conference called upon the executive to continue its efforts towards the amalgamation of kindred unions-National Union of Dock Labourers and Riverside Workers.- The Conference of this body opened at Bangor on the 18th May. Mr. J. Sexton spoke of the &quot; vicious circle &quot; of prices and wages. A resolution was adopted calling on the executive to consider the amalgamation of all dock labour and coal trimmers&apos; unions. A telegram was received from Messrs. Thome and Clynes, stating that the National Union of General Workers would welcome negotiations for amalgamation. It was also decided to seek amendments to the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act. A levy of fourpence per thousand members was authorised in support of the Dutch Transport Workers at present on strike,* and a further levy to defray the cost of the inquiry into the conditions of dockThis Dutch Transport strike collapsed some weeks ago.
National Union of Clerics.The Twenty-ninth Annual Conference of this Union opened on the 22nd May in Glasgow. The Conference came to the decision to group members in occupational guilds with a supervisory national executive. A motion that the Union should confine itself to industrial measures and not take political action was defeated, after discussion, by a large majority. Mr. G. A. Lloyd, of Shepherd&apos;s Bush, was elected President for the ensuing year, and Mr. H. H. Elvin was re-elected General Secretary. The Executive was instructed to circularise the trade union movement to put into operation the union rate of pay for their clerks, and to request unions and labour bodies to see that their branches do not give any orders to firms whose clerks do not belong to the N.U.C., and which have no minimum conditions.
