340THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT1.1herring fishery 1920: memorandum by the secretary for Scotland.1. I append a copy of a Memorandum to the Chancellor of theExchequer dated the 21st May, 1920, containing a recommendation that the Government should guarantee to purchase pickled herrings cured during the forthcoming summer fishery in Scotland and autumn fishery in England.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has felt unable, after discussion, to agree to the proposals made.    The matter is of great importance and also of great urgency in view of the commencement of the summer fishery in Scotland on the 15th June and I feel that it is necessary to bring the matter before the Cabinet.3. Tho proposals are summarised in Paragraph 4 of theaccompanying&apos;Memorandum.    Briefly, their effect is that the Government should guarantee to purchase up to a maximum of 1.000,000 barrels for the Scottish si&amp;imer fishing at a price of 66/- a barrel and up to a similar maximum for the English autumn fishing at a price of 70/- a barrel.    The maximum liability incurred would thus be about  3,500,000 for each fishing.    The proposals were submitted by the industry with the explanation that they were framed with a view to riving the fishermen merely a fair living wage and allowing the curers no profit.     In other words the prices represent no more than costs of production allowing a reasonable remuneration to labour.    I have had the Scottish figures examined and I am satisfied that  his statement is well-founded.    It should be added that the quantities and^ totals mentioned are maxima and that in the case of somewhat similar guarantees in 1919 the actual expenditure fell considerably snort of the maxima.4. The necessity for making these proposals arises from thedifficulty of disposing of pickled herrings otherwise than on credit in the two main markets, Russia ana Germany.    Before the War 80$ of the herrings caugjht were exported, the Home market only being able to absorb about 20fc    The export trade has been largely in abeyance during the War and the fishing much restricted owing to naval operations and the employment of most of the vessels, with their crews, in naval service.   At the present time practically all the vessels, with their crews, nave been demobilised -andUare ready to resume their calling,, &quot;The Scottish fishing is due to begin on 15th Juno,    It cannot, however, proceed unless the GarisnTroent undertake to purchase the herrings cured, in so far as the^oirwrs are unable to dispose of them privately.
Sk 15. On the merits the Chancellor has informed me that he cannot agree to the proposals, especially in view of the^large expenditure involved and the risk of a recurrence of similar demands from this industry in future years.6. I fully appreciate the weight of these objections.At the same time I regard it as imperative that the guarantee should be given because the only alternative is disastrous, namely, a total collapse of tbt herring fishing during the coming season.7. I am anxious that the best means of minimising a risk of a recurrence of similar demands in future years should be carefully considered,    I think that it would be advan-tageous if this question were examined with reference to the future prospects of Continental markets by a Committee con-taininff representatives of the Departments concerned (including the Treasury) and of the herring industry.8,    &quot;ftithtregard to the pending season I desire to emphasise the gravity of tho situation and urgently to request that the Cabinet should authorise the adoption of the proposed scheme in principle.    I am quite-agreeable that the prices and other details -should be the subject of full discussion with the Treasury.ROBERT MUM).5rd June, 1920.Scottish Office.
HTBRiNft  ISSES 1920;Memorandum to,the Chancellor of the exchequer.1.        A deputation representing all sections of the Herring Industry in Great Britain was received on 4th May by the Secretary for Scotland, who was accompanied by the Secretary of the Fisheries pi vision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and by representatives uf ather departments.   The object of the deputation was to state the critical condition in which the industry finds itself owing to the financial con-ditions prevailing in its European markets and to request that the Government should undertake to purchase at agreed prices the quantities (within certain Limits) of herrings to be cured during the coming season in Scotland.   A similar request was made with&apos; regard to the autumn season in Blast-Anglia.2v       Before agreeing to the reception of the deputation we reminded the applicants of the announcement made last autumn that the financial assistance then given for the autumn fishing at Yarmouth and Lowest oft would not oe repeated.   Wo were informed in reply that this condition was fully recognised but that, under stress of necessity, the representatives of the industry desired an opportunity of stating their case-for reconsideration-.3.       At the interview representatives of the boat-owners, fishermen, curers and exporters described very moderately but very emphatically the grave position of the industry., practically all the fishermen and drifters have now been demobilised and 30,00* workers, men and women, are making arrangements for the season&apos;s operations on the Scottish coast.   It is reckoned that 100,000 persons are dependent upon these workers and that the livelihood of another 100,000 persons (including dependents) is derived less -directly from the herring fishing.4.        The first proposal made by the Industry is that the Government should gi\pe a guarantee to :purchase cured herrings at a price of 68/- a barrel (or 73/ for two half barrels) up to a maximum of 1,000,000 barrels for the Scottish summer fishing.   It was further proposed that a guarantee should be given for an equal quantity at a price of 7o/- a barrel (or 75/- for two half barrels) for the English fishing in the autumn.   It was stated that the prices named are only sufficient to give the fishermen-a living wage and to enable the &quot;turers to keep their establishments going without any profit -on the picked herrings sold to the Government.   We have caused the figures to be carefully examined and having received the reports *of the officers of our Departments upon thtso, we are satisfied that this statement is well founded. The price allowed to the fishermen la 5o/- a.*ran, i.e. lid. per-lb*   copies of the draft sohemee are appended together with statements showing the eurers* costs and the estimated rftturn to tht fishermen in steam drifters and motor drifters
9 a Oo.r    The, sohvmcg en.- limited to the ja r iuds loth June to  1st August for ocotl,.nd and 5th October to 4th December tor Yarmouth and lowostoft.   These represent the p,.rts of the r^sj:octive seasons during wiuch the; best and most koepable herrings arc caught,   ihe total amounts covered by the schcinoe are thus restiicte-d and the less marketable fish Sire excluded,5,     The quantities, mentioned above represent the estimated produce of the fibbing fleets during those periods apart from the proportion of the catch which can be dispoed of as fresh rierrings, kivpers, etc., in the :iomc market.**v    &quot;The woottish fishing is due &quot;to&apos; begin next month (Juno ). In Ordinary times the herrings cured would be sold to foreign buyers for cash during the course of the season.   This cash is.s used to finance further operations mi in view, of early sales for cash the curers are able in ordinary times to get advances from the banks   for the purchase of the fish etc., and the payment of wages.   The whole of this machinery is disltcated by the fact that only a limited proportion cf continental buyers can ray foi purchases in cash or short-dated bills.     Ihe bulk of the curers are men with small capital and, having provided barrels etc in advance, their working capital fox the purchase of herrings from the fishermen, wages, etc., is only adequate to keep them going for a short time, usually not exceeding a week or two.   For the same reason the curers, with few exceptions, are unable to give: the necessary credit to continental buyers,8.     It is the unanimous opinion of the Industry endorsed by our advisers that if the fleets aere to begin fishing there would be a collapse of the operations of fishing and curing within a very short time unless assistance is given by the government.   If this happened the consequences to the fishermen and their dependents would be calamitous.9.     The De]utation made it clear that they fully recognised tho condition upon which financial assistance vvas given last autumn.   They v.ere most reluctant to make a fresh appeal for assistance but they were driven to do so by the necessity for preserving the Industry from threatened destruction. Last autumn they believed that the signing   of peace vith Germany would lead to an improvement in the conditions under which commerce is conducted, both with Germany and with other countries on the Continent,   Unhappily the European situation had in this respect become much worse.   The mark had declined from about 2d. last autumn to about Id. in value at the date of the interview: and in/
in the other countries concerned there was a corresponding depression in the exchange.10.     Apart from-the financial did difficulties there is a great demand for curod herrings in European countries which are notoriously short of food. Pickled herrings, for which there was a vast and regular demand in Germany and Russia as constituted before the War, are now the cheapest nltrogeggtift food obtainable.   If produced in Great Britain at the prices mentioned above pickled herrings can be delivered, say, at Hamburg, at a price of 4d. per lb.   The whole difficulty is in financing such transactions.   If the proposed guarantee is approved the curors and exporters are prepared to co-oper-ate with the Government to the fullest extent, first, in marketing privately as groat a quantity of cured herrings as can bo so disposed of, second-ly by acting as sole or joint agents for the Goverh-ment in any negotiations with the German Government or similar buyers.   In Germany all such purchases are in the hands of a Commission authorised by tho Government, viz. the Reichsfischversorgung, and the contracts under which upwards of 220,000 barrels from Scotland and 150,000 barrels from England were sold to this Commission durina the past twelve months were negotiated by curers and exporters working in collaboration with the two Departments. Leading members of the Industry have conducted nero-tiations in Rotterda,r. and in Berlin for this purpose at a. great sacrifice of their own time and interests.The- endeavour is being made to arrange business on a large scale in the sale abroad for cash of fresh henings during the English autumn season. If this endeavour is successful the quantity cured and. there-fore subject to the guarantee v-ould be materially re-duo ed *llo        The results of the guarantee given by the two Departments last year are set out in the accompanying note.     It will be seen that if the German bills are honoured at maturity a year hence there will be a profit (apart from interest) on the Scottish contract of over  200,000, of which the Government&apos;s share will be 80 per cent.     Owing largely to the failure of a contract arranged with Russia, the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries * account is less favourable but taking the two trans-actions together it is expected that there will still be a considerable profit assuming&apos; that the bills are duly honoured,12.        It is contemplated that arrangements with the Germans generally similar to those mentioned in Par. 10 will be negotiated this year.   A certain&apos;1 quantity of cured herringscan/
can he sold to customers in Europe able to pay,    Tho United States may take 50,000 barrels.     Other opportunitcs or disposal will be fully explored and we submit that if credits aro given to Furopean countries for the pure&quot; ase of food supplies it should be a condition of Great britain&apos;s adhesion to any such scheme that the available stock of British pickled herrings should be taken into account and used for the purpose *13.   The arrangements made with Germany during the past twelve months are somev/hat similar to those provided for by the scheme of the Fxport Credits Department which, however,  does not apply to Germany and only applies to a limited portion of Russia.     The possible application of the scheme to the disposal of stocks of cured herrings has been discussed with the Manager of the Department and with representatives of the herring trade.     It is agreed that the scheme will not meet the main problems relatin to the export of cured herrings,     r&apos;e are prepared to treat the proposed guarantee as an alternative excluding resort to the export credits scheme and to make it a condition of participation by any curer in the guarantee that he shall forego his right to claim assistance from the Export Credits Department,14.     It should be added that the supply of food for consumption in the United kingdom will be assisted by the proposed guarantee.     The Home market can take only about 20 per cent of the herrings caught by the fleets - (say) 200,000 crans or 35,000 tons in each season,,     At the prices fixed for fresh herrings under the proposed guarantee such herrings can be marketed in Great Britain$ with a good return to dealers, at 4d. per lb.     Similarly, kippers can be marketed at 7d/per lb.     The collapse of the fishing would, of course, deprive the Home market of the supplies which it can take and as a consequence there would be some increase in the general cost of living,15.     In view of the foregoing considerations we regard it as imperative that assistance should be given to the industry in accordance with the scheme submitted by its representatives.    V.re urge this view with great reluctance having regard to the undertaking given last autumn and of the financial difficulties of the Government,    If, however, such assistance Is not granted we are satisfied that grave consequences will ensue.    The British herring fleets are the finest in the world.    They are manned by a body of fishermen who are unrivalled In their skill and enterprise and who freely sacrificed their interests and render-cd indefatigable and heroic services to the nation during the war.    Formidable competitors have arisen during the war Inthe/
the Northwest of Europe.    The dispersion of the fishermen by the stopping of their operations would deprive the nation of one of its most valuable assets.    The proposed guarantee would prevent this disaster and after anxious consideration we are unable to devise any other solution.^16*    we are unable to draw a line between the Scottish and English fisheries and a^ree with the representative^ of the Industry in thinking that both fisheries will need the financial assistance of the Government., . !7e- are, however, of, opihlon that while a guarantee should be given, now in respect of the &apos; autumn fishery, it should be subject to the understanding that the terms of the scheme may be modified should any marked improvement In the economic conditions arise in the meantime.(Sd)   ROBERT OTR0 (Sd)   A.
