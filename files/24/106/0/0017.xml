^ rTHE CABINET.INTER-ALLIED AND ANGLO-AMERICAN DEBTS.I must reiterate my objections to the course proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. 1259, viz., of releasing our Allies from their debts to us without claiming a similar release for ourselves from the United States. I have, in CP. 1156, argued this case from the point of view of our financial relations with the United States. It is not less important from the point of view of our relations with France and Germany. We wish to secure a moderate and reasonable policy towards Germany as regards reparation, and especially the imposition of a fixed sum. France will certainly demand, before agreeing to this, something in the nature of forgiveness of debt as well as priority in devastated areas. If we give away at the present this power to meet France to a considerable extent in regard to her debts to us, we shall deprive ourselves of one of the means of effecting a good arrangement for Germany. The true sequence of events should be    *1. Fixing a moderate and reasonable sum for Germany to pay on all accounts.2. Arranging for the forgiveness of French and Italian debts.3. Both the above to be conditional on the United States doing its share andforgiving European debts. 4. Bringing the whole matter squarely before the United States.I presume there is no question of this matter being settled without a definite decision of the Cabinet.w. s. war Office,15th May, 1920.(B20/237)   100  5/20  H&amp;S   8231wo
