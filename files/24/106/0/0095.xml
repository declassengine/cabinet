Mth reference to H.A.0, 58, Minute   3, I circulate-herewith a revised draft of the Juries Bill.Precepts have to be issued by Clerks of the Peace to Overseers before the S5th July next, and it will be necessary for the Homo Office to issue instructions as to the form of preoept, etc. to Clerks of the Peace in time to enable them to get the necessary printing and other arrangements completed before that date.     The matter is one of very considerable urgency and it is in the highest degree desirable that the Bill should be passed into law before the end of the present month. I do not anticipate any opposition.I should be glad to have authority to arrange for the introduction of the Bill in tho House of Lords, subject to the fj oonaent of the Chief Whip, at the earliest possible moment.E.S.3rd June, 1980.
Juries bill memorandum.Before 191S the jury lists were prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Juries Act, 1825, and the Juries Act, 1862.In 1918 power was given by s. 6 of the Juries Act of that year to modify by Order in Council the provisions of the Acts of 1825 and 1862 for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary expense and labour in the preparation of the lists, and also with respect to the place and manner of publication. The Act of 1918 will expire six months after the end of the war, and this Bill is intended to take its place.Clause 1 substantially re-enacts the main provisions con-tained in the Order in Council made under the Act of 1918, and also enables the size of jury lists to be diminished by providing for the exclusion from lists of certain particulars wrhich are at present required to be inserted.Section 5 of the Juries Act, 1918, temporarily raised the age limit of jurors from 60 to 65. Clause 2 of the Bill proposes to repeal it as from 31st December next. Jurors over 60 who are now on the lists will of course remain liable to he summoned till the end of the year; but persons over that age will not be placed upon the new lists.120-5a
