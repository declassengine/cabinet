The Committee, in tho first place considered the powersi.that oan at present be exercised under the existing enactments for the provontion of crime and restoration of order, and in par-tioular/those given by tho Criminal Law and Procedure Act, 1887, and tho Defence of the Realm Aetc and the Regulations bado under . them.    The &apos;0pfeai.ittoe reviewed the provision mado by former Irish Emergency Statutes with respect to courts martial, arrest and sus-pects, the carrying and importation of arms 1 and&apos; the constitution of special&apos;civil courts.    Upon a detailed analysis of tho powers necessary for the purpose of dealing with the present emergency and an examination of those conferred-by the&apos; existing statute Lav; and under thbDefonoe of the&apos;Realm regulations and a comparison of these povfere with those which&apos;could bo exorcised if mattial law were declared, the Oommittoo cabo to tho conclusion that in present -circumstances the existing powers-would bo sufficient if strengthened by tho/.
conferment upon a court martial acting; under tho Defence o-:: tlio Realm Regulations of tho power to impose the capital penalty.&apos; Under the present law the power, of a court martial to impose a capital penalty is confined to offences committed with tho intention )  assisting the enemy.-   Tho Committee recommend that this, restriction should be removed&quot; and that a court martial should ho authorised to impose a capital penalty in all cases in whioh, ii tho offence wore doalt with by a civil court, that court would havo power to pronounce sentence of death, and that legislation should be introduced for tho purpose. 1The Committee considered a proposal for legislation for securing the payment of tho compensation awardod to persons who had suffered injury to. the person or property, or to the personal representative ox oolico officers and other persons who had been murdered.-..... In several cases county councils against whom decrees&apos; &apos; ;for compensation have been made havo refusod to levy rates to raiso the compensation* and it was proposed tiu.t power should bo taken to intercept the payments to such councils from the Local Taxation (Ireland) -account and to apply the same in discharge of tho compensation.   A Bill for the purpose was considered and its introduction was recommended.The Committee considered suggestions for setting up a, form of blockade against-disaffectod areas by;stopping postal and-railway conmmiiications; with those&apos; areas and restricting :, the movement of the population, but were of - opinion that this coursewhilst - inflict ing considerable injury to innocent - &apos;:-. persons, would, bo of doubtful efficacy.in restoring ordor and Would, be likely to-give rise to serious labour troubles which mi^ht not be.cbniinod to the disaffected-areas :or to Ireland.&apos;(Sd. ) BlifiCllElJD..
