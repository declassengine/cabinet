U 1 - -............. - 4 n 4PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM. From the Governor General of the *Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of StateBIH^\for the Colonies.ft339    )* ^Received Colonial Office 11.55 p.m. 24th May, 1920.)Your Confidential despatch March 23rd Mandatesrrj   Prime Minister advises as follows begins.   The greatest con-cern is felt by the Corrraonwealth Government at the delay, owing to opposition of Japan, in the issue of mandates.Proposed omission of provisions establishing equal opportunities for the nationals of all members of the League of Nations for trade and commerce was debated fully in Paris and the decision adverse to the wishes of the Japanese Government was reached only after full consideration had been given to their views.   This decision is embodied in the Covenant of the League of Nations all of which has already been signed by Japan equally with Great Britain and the other European Allies.   In these circumstances the Commonwealth Government is unable to understand what justi-fication Japan can now have for taking objection to a mandate in the form to which she has already agreed. Government feels that it must respectfully urge that diplomatic pressure should be brought to bear on the Japanese Government by the British Government to join in the immediate issue of the mandate.   The long delay has proved most embarrassing to Commonwealth and has created an intolerable position and one which cannot continue. Commonwealth Government desires to point out that, if the deliberate and solemn decisions of the Peace Conference and the Supreme Council can by the refusal of one of theparties
parties to the Treaty and to the decisions of the Supreme Council be ignored and. rendered nugatory, the great principle upon which the Treaty and the League of Nations rest will be destroyed.   Japan had the fullest opportunity to present her case to the Conference.   This she did and the nations decided against her.  She cannot merely because she is a powerful nation having at her disposal great military resources be allowed to flout the solemn decisions of the Conference ends.MUNRO FERGUSON.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM.
