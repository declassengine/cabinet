/ i&apos; f&apos; u[IS DOCIfl^P IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S G-OVSRMENT.\A L.a.30.Incre &amp;//of Rent and Mortgage Interest(Restriotion)Bill.Memorandum by the Minister of Health, confidential?.. ------^--f C-xftf.) 1.    In accordance with the decision of the Home AffairsCommittee the Rent Restrictions Bill has been con-fined to dwelling houses *    There can be no doubt, however, that a determined effort will be made in Parliament to extend the pro^i sions of the Bill to shops and other business premises, and if this is to be avoided it will be necessary for the Government to be prepared with a declaration of policy in re-gard to tide matter when the Bill comes up for Second Recuing,2,    Most of the small shopkeepers will be proteoted, since a dwelling house part of which is used as a shop will still be a dwelling house for the purposes of the Bill.    But the Bill will not protect either (a) the tenants of shops which do not form part of a dwelling house however small their rental may be, or (b) the tenants of any shops, offices, or other business premises, the rent or rateable value of which exceeds  105 in London,  90 in Scotland, and  78 in the rest of the Country,3.    The extension of the protection enjoyed by tenants of dwelling houses to tenants of premises of the same value used exclusively for business purposes would be open to the objection that it would be opening the door to the introduction of an entirely new principle while only covering a very small proportion of the cases in which hardship is allegeda If therefore the legitimate grievances of tenants
of business premises are to be dealt with, it seems to me thac they should bo dealt with on uniform lines without distinguishing between tenancies of low and those of high value.My own view is that the very intricate and con-trovers ial questions involved should be referred for examination by a Select Committee of the House of Commons.    If this view is adopted the terms of reference to the Select Committee will require careful consideration:(a) Tho Landlord and Tenant Bill might be revived and referred to the Select Com-mittee4    This Bill was drafted for the Ministry of Reconstruction in 1918 and deals generally with the rights of landlord and tenant in all classes of property not subject to the provision of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1908.     It deals with such questions as security of tenure, improvements, and compensation in respect of tenantfs improvements and loss of good will, restriction on the power to grant leases for lives, and other matters, and sets up a body of Judicial Land Commissioners to settle disputes arising under the Bill or otherwise between landlords and tenants.    The Bill would give leaseholders the right to obtain a renewal or extension of their leases for such term, at such rent, and upon such conditions as were determined by the Com-missioners.    A detailed summary of this Bill is attached.
(b)   As an alternative.,- a Select -Committee mightbe appointed with more limited terms of reference, e,g, to advise as to what action can usefully be taken for protecting the tenants of business premises against unreasonable increases of rent or unreasonable dispossession.My own view, however, is that the only just and satisfactory way of dealing with these Issues it, generally on the lines of the Landlord and Tenant Bill and I would prefer to see such a Bill read a second time and then referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons or to a Joint Committee of the two Houses*It would no doubt be necessary to set up the SelectCommittee immediately.   But even so It will probablybe objected that the Committee could not report intime to permit- of legislation being passed this session.    If this objection cannot be overcomeand if it proves to be necessary to take some immediate action I think that the best plan wouldbe to adopt the suggestion referred to in my previous memo,, and to provide that, pending the Report of the Select Committee, the tenancy ofall business premises (and perhaps of all dwelling houses not covered by the Bill) expiring on andafter (say) 25th March last (?) should be extended24th June next upon the same terms and conditions as the expiringtenancy for a period ending on December 25th, 1921,subject -(a) to an increase of rent not exceeding 50%of the rent reserved by the expiring tenancy, and(b) to an appeal to the Court (defined as Ins. 30(3) of the Housing Act 1919) who migfrtdetermine the tenancy &quot;on the ground that the-3-
landlord requires possession of the property in order to carry out some scheme of re-construction or improvement desirable In the public Interest&quot; (oefe clause 5 of the Landlord and Tenant Bill), subject possibly to the payment of compensation for loss of goodwill etc.C.ADDIS0N. 31, 59 20.
