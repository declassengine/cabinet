Sir G. L. Barstow, K.C.B., Treasury. Adjutant-General. Director-General of Mobilization.Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff (represented by Colonel H. E. R. R. Braine). Director of Personal Services.D. F. (a) was also present during the latter part of the discussion.Terms of Reference.To make recommendations, which the Secretary of State can bring before the Cabinet, for the prompt raising of a special Corps of Gendarmerie, not exceeding 8,000 men, in aid of the Royal Irish Constabulary during the emergency period, and particularly to advise by whom the Corps should be raised and paid, what the legal status of the enlisted men should be, under what machinery it should be administered when raised, in what proportion British and Irish sources should be drawn upon, and what the proportion of officers and non-commissioned officers should be, together with estimates.S. of S.Our terms of reference are &quot; to make recommendations for the prompt raising of a special Corps of Gendarmerie, not exceeding 8,000 men, in aid of the Royal Irish Constabulary during the emergency period.&quot;Our views with regard to the suggested Corps of Gendarmerie are as follows : (1.) Such a corps could not be raised with the promptitude necessary to meet the requirements of the present emergency. It is essential that the recruiting of the men should begin at once and that they should be forthcoming without delay, if they are to be an effective substitute for the Regular battalions which must otherwise be sent to Ireland. Before any Corps of Gendarmerie, a type of force new to this country, could be raised, a period of delay would be inevitable for creating the administrative machinery and obtaining the necessary powers. It is considered that the numbers required could not be obtained in less than a year.(2.) Even if such a corps could be raised within the time required it would not be satisfactory from the point of view of discipline. Police discipline is too weak in the circumstances now prevailing in Ireland, the more so as the men we may expect to recruit are largely men of the New Army, willing to join up again for a short period, who will need the strictest discipline.(3.) There is the further point that &quot; gendarmerie &quot; recruited for this exceptional purpose would have to be paid at exceptional rates, and this would undoubtedly lead to trouble with the Royal Irish Constabulary regarding their pay.For these reasons we are of opinion that the suggested creation of a Corps of Gendarmerie is not feasible.(.B20/243)   100  5/20  II&amp;S  8240vvo
22. The alternative we recommend is the special enlistment as soldiers of eight garrison battalions. They should be men between the ages of 26 and 35 who have served in the war. We are of opinion that these can be obtained much more quickly than a corresponding number of gendarmerie or constabulary, recruiting can begin at once, they will fit into the existing organization and all necessary powers as regards discipline will be provided by the Army Act. We suggest that enlistment should be for one year with a Government option of retention for a second.3. It is considered that there would be no difficulty in obtaining these men if the present rates of separation allowance could be maintained, but if the drastic reductions recently agreed upon with the Admiralty and Air Ministry are to be enforced in their case, the rates of pay remaining as at present, it is extremely doubtful whether they will be forthcoming. Moreover, if it is intended to make such reductions, the men must in fairness be warned at the time of enlistment, and this in effect would mean that enlistment could not in any case commence until the new rates have received Cabinet approval.4. Apart from the difficulty of re-opening the question with the Admiralty and Air Ministry we have come to the conclusion that it would be quite impracticable to maintain special rates of separation allowance for these newly enlisted men, while imposing the drastic reductions contemplated throughout the whole of the rest of the Army.,The alternative which we recommend is that a special flat rate of pay should be fixed for each rank of non-commissioned officers and men, the usual allowances in kind (rations, clothing, accommodation) to be given in addition, but no separation allowance to be paid and no distinction to be made between married and single. We propose that the rate for a private should be 5s. per day, and the rates for non-commissioned officers on a proportionate basis. A recruiting reward of 4s. per man should be paid. The Treasury are prepared to agree to these proposals.It is considered that the 8,000 men will be forthcoming on this basis, but there may be difficulty in obtaining in addition the 3,000 old soldiers required for regular battalions, many of whom may prefer to join this force on the terms suggested.As regards officers, no difficulty is anticipated in obtaining the numbers required and no special rates of pay are considered necessary.5. In calling for recruits the special nature of the force organized for a short period for a temporary purpose, quite distinct from the Regular Army, and for service only within the United Kingdom should be emphasized. We&apos; recommend that it should be made clear that the force is intended for service in Ireland, but this is a question of policy.6. Our recommendations with regard to the specific questions on which we have to -advise are therefore as follows : (1.) The force should consist of eight garrison battalions, not gendarmerie.   limits of age, period of service, rates of pay, &amp;c, to be as set out above. (2.) It should be raised and paid by the War Office.(3.) The legal status of the enlisted men should be that of soldiers under the Army Act.(4.) The force, when raised, should be administered by the War Office. (5.) Enlistment should be confined to Great Britain. (6.) The proportion of officers should be 35 per battalion.(7.) The proportion of non-commissioned officers should be 10 per cent, above normal establishment.C. F. N. MACREADY, General G. L. BARSTOW.G. M. W. MACDONOGH.H. E. BRAINE, Lieut-Colonel.B. F.
