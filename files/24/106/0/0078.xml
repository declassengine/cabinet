251*W k./  J.Home Office,Whitehall,S.W.1st June, 1920.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,The International Labour Office has received atelegram dated 1st May in the following terms from the hungarian Government&quot;M, Albert Ihoma&apos;8, 7, seamore Place, London, The Hungarian Government ascertained how malevolently certain factors endeavour to influence the public opinion of foreign countries concerning the present Government of Hungary.     In order to definitely remove this inconvenience and to facilitate just appreciation of our cause the Hungarian Government would be glad if the International Labour Office would delegate to Hungary at earliest .possible date a Committee consisting of greatest possible number of members who could get into direct touch with the leaders of the Bulgarian workmen and with the Hungarian^ Government and thus form a clear idea as to our position and convince themselves by personal experience of the   \ utter uselessness of the mendacious rumours concerning the alleged white terror and persecution of workmen.   Count Telek, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs&quot; (Telegram somewhat illegible)and. the hiaxrtorof the Office is proposing that the invitationshould be accepted, and that a small Commission should beappointed at once, consisting of one Government delegate, onedelegate representing jjmployers and one representing Workers,accompanied by some technical advisers from the Office.    Theproposal will come up for consideration at the meeting of theGoverning Body of the Office next week, and I shall be glad toknow whether I should support the proposal or what line I shouldtake.Another proposal which will come up for consideration at the meeting of the Governing Body is the appointment of a Committee of the Governing .uody to consider the revision of its constitution.   This, as you will remember, is fixed by Article 393 of the Treaty of Peace, which provides that the Governing; -Body shall consist of twelve persons representingThe Governments (of whom eight shall be nominated      sheGovernments which are of the Chief industrial importance), sixpersons elected by the Employers&apos; delegates to the Conferenceand six persons elected by the Workers1 delegates to tho Conference,The re
proThere was a good deal of dissatisfaction at the Washington Conference last November among the representatives of the countries outside Europe at the great preponderance of European Representatives in the Governing Body, and a resolution was passed in favour of a reconsideration of the constitution of the Governing Body,     I see no objection to the appointment of a Committee of the Governing Body for the purpose, but the proposals which the Director has submitted for the constitution of the Committee do not include an official representative of Great Britain.    As &quot;the question ie om of cortex if Lie impcirtance, I take it the British Government should be represented, and I propose to press for that.     Do you agree?Yours sincerely,(Signed) MALCOLM DEIEVLNGMESir Maurice Hankey, C.C.B.
