(THIS DOOUiCTT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN 10- MAJESTY1 3 GOVERNMENT),SECRET. Copy No.cabinet internation LABOUR CONFERENCE, TfASHIr&apos;GTON,Supplementary Report by Mr. G.N. Barnes and Sir Mlfcdim Deieyinghe:(Note by the Secretary).With reference to the Report by the official Delegatestt the First International Labour Conference (C.P.377), andto the Supplementary Report by Mr. G.N, Barnes (CP,595),the attached supplementary Report by the Official Delegatesregarding the application to seamen of the Draft convention on the question of the eight hours1 day and forty-eight hours1theweek is circulated for/information of the Cabinet.It is understood that the negotiations now taking place between shipowners and seamen on the reduction nf hours of service at sea are likely to be imperilled by the contention of the seamen&apos;s representatives that the Washington Convention concefles the principle of the eight-hours1 day and forty-eight hours&apos; week to seamen.     The attached report by the Official Delegates shows what the position is, and it has been communicated to the Minister of Labour in order that the facts may be brought officially to the notice of the ship-owners1 and seamen representatives.(Signed)     M.P.A.HAN JOTSecretary, Cabinet.2 Whitehall Gardens, s.&apos;&apos;r.

iroMAlPIOM&apos; LABOUH OOHiPHRIilNOB t WASHINGTON.. 1919,SupplemontjivrjLilxC?ort by J:ir.G.N. Barnes ^and Sir Maloolm Delevinffnoo//o think it desirable to submit the following supplementary Report in continuation of our previous Report of the 30th December, 1919, (CeP.377), and Mr.Barnosr Cabinet Memorandum of tho 7th February, 1920, (C0P.595), as we understand thatdoubts havo arlson as to the construction of tho draft Convention o:i tho question of the eight hours1 day and forty-eight hours1 week adopted by the International Labour Conference at Washington last November, in relation to tho question of the regulation of tho hours of seamen, which is to be disoussed at the approaching International Labour Conference at Genoa, We are informeo. that the seamen^ representatives in this country are claiming that the V/ashington Convention concede? the principle of tho eight hours1 day and forty-eight hours1 week for seamen and the representatives of the shipowners are saying that if that is so it is useless for them to send representatives to the Genoa Conference.    The seamen*s claim is a misunderstanding of the position and it is most important that the misunderstandings should be removed at onceu The VJashington Convention does not commit any State which ratifies it to the adoption of the eight hours&apos; day or forty-eight hours1 y.week for seamenft   If it had, we could not possibly have voted for the Convention.    The terms of the Convention make the position quite olear.Article 1, which is the definition clause, provides:-&quot;I!&apos;or the purpose of this Convention the term &quot;industrialundertaking&quot; includes particularly...................(d)transport of passengers or ?oods by road, rail, sea or inland w at.e rway;t otca&quot;   but adds the qualifying clause &quot;The provisions-- relative to transport by sea^and on
inland waterways, shall be determined by a speoial Conference dealing; with emjoio^reassessment  at sea and on inland wategTO^a&quot;^ The draft Convention then goes on to deal with the regulation of th.\ hours of employment of persons employed in industrial undertakings,    Artiole Z provides that &quot;the working hours of persons employed in any publio or private industrial undertaking.....shall not oxoeed eight in the day and forty-eight in the week, with the exceptions hereinafter provided for.&quot;      This main provision is followed by a series of clauses modifying the main provision. Article 3 allows the limit of hours to be &quot;exceeded in case of accident,, o-otual or threatened, or in oase of urgent work to be done to machinery or plant, or in oaso of foroe majeure&quot;. Article 4.substitutes fifty-six hours as the weekly limit in the continuous industries.   - Article 5 provides for the eightT,hours1 limit being exceeded by agreement in ca^ses in which the eight hours1 limit,cannot be applied, but subject to the Observance of the;weekly limit of 48 hours.    Article 6 provides -(a) for certain classes of -workers being excepted entirely from the operation of the -eight hours1 day or forty-eight hours&apos;&apos; week., and (p) for overtime in oases of pressure of work...-It is perfectly olear, from the above rec%tal, that the claim that the eight hours! day or&apos;forty-eight hours&apos;1 week has been conceded to seamen by the Washington Conference is unfounded..   Sven if the Convention applied to employment at sea, the employment sould have-the benefit of the exceptions which have been enumerated above.. .3&apos;or instance,, Article 4, which fixes, the weekly limit for continuous industries at&apos; fifty-six hours instead of&apos; forty-eight,&apos; would certainly apply to employment at sea.   But the Convention expressly says that &apos; &quot;the provisions relative to transport by sea shall be determined by a special Conference&quot;^ -an/3&quot; the intention clearly was to leave the question of hours of labour for seamen for consideration by a
Conference of experts.   There were no persons specially acquainted with the conditions of employment at sea at the Washington conference and the question had not been considered by the Organising committee which prepared the Reports on the different items of the agenda for the Conference.That this is the correct interpretation is strongly supported by the Report of the Committee of the conference which drafted the Convention, and by the proceedings in the full session of .the Conference when the Report was discu33ed. Employment at sea was not included among &quot;industrial undertakings&quot; in the draft convention originally submitted to the Conference by the Organising Committee, but was inserted at the instance of the workers in the,Committee appointed by the Conference to consider the question of the eight hours&apos; day.   The Report pf the Committee, in referring to, the matter, was as fellows:-&apos;&quot;in article 1, paragraph (d),&apos; it is not a question of an explanatory modification,, but of a basic one of great impor-tance.   After the words-&quot;transport of passengers or goods by road or rail&quot; the commission adds &quot;by sea or inland waterway&quot; Limitation ef-the hours of work on ships and beats&apos;is gre-scribed herein.   The commission added, however, at the end of the paragraph, the following words.; &quot;provisions relative to -transport by sea shall be determined by a special conference on maritime employment.&quot;&quot;in regard to transportatien by sea,, therefore it is ^n.r.y A question of affirming a principle; the application of the principle, will be in conformity with the regulations to be indicated by a special., conference.   Moreover, in a report of the chairman of the committee of selection on motions relating to the agenda.of a. future conference you are invited to express your opinion on holding a special conference on^maritime employment.-  Therefore I need not emphasise the    matter here-&quot; ,There is no menti on here even of an eight hours.&apos; day or a
forty--eight hours&apos;&apos; w*Jk.foT^-btwx^eru  *bj&amp;l sft%&amp;\.&amp;t Xk&amp; hmum&quot;cf -work on 11ships and beats&quot; alona is indicated.Then in the discussion of the Report in the full sessionof the Confer once,y^vernl speakers tc jrred to this question point:) ng out the difficulties of applying the E.C*ht hours&apos; day to seamen.-, and objection to the reference to seamen was taken in particular by Kr.* Rowel 1, one of tha official delegates from Canada.     ICr. Resell moved to dnit the reference, and said/;.-,......&quot;I. submit, Kr , President, it is of the utmost importance that this Conference in its deliberations should confine itself to matters covered by the agenda, upon which the representatives of the Governments have hud an opportunity to inform themselves and to come to the Conferenoe prepared to express an opinion.This matter was expressly withdrawn from the considered tionof the Governments by the report sent out to the -    Governments, and, as a Government *7e have not been informed on that particular matter.&quot; - M. Fontaine, one. of the official delegates from France, who was the Reporter of the Committee, therefore interposed with the following explanation :-&quot;Au paragraphs (d), par les mots &quot;transport par terre ou-par ahenins. do fer, par mer ou par voie d&apos;eau inteTrieure on ne ;fait., en *e qui concerne la navigation intorieur ou maritime, -qu!affirmer -un prinoipe general dont 11 application est laissee onticrement, qpres le vote que vous venez .;.d:&apos;emettre, a une conference speciale.   Gette&apos; application peut otro aussi souple que oelle qui a etc prevue a l1article 4 ct a l1artifile        la question des modalities et des exceptions necessaires est entiorenent devant la conference speciale.Jvappelle 11 attention do nos colleagues sur le fait que le t&apos;\xte que nous rapportons,  concu d&apos; 3ne fa con tros

JL.es det a i 3s de lareg^lomentation sqnt- renvoyes a. une conference de specialistes, je supplie M. Rowell do ne pas oompromettree le sort de nob re convent ion  ourjtine^ question ^de^fo rme,.,M In view of this explanation Mr. Rowel! withdrew hisamendment.It would no doubt have been better if the reference to employment at sea had been omitted, as there is a danger of the workers thinking that, the Conference committed itself to more than it actually did, but there was a general desire not to do anything to risk the acceptance by the Conference of the  raft Convention, and for our cwn part we were satisfied, after the explanation riven by IL Fontaine, that the Government would not be bound to any particular arrangement for the regulation of the hours of seamen..It appears to us that the position may be summed up thus (l) that the Washington Conference has pronounced in favour of the principle .of some regulation of the hours of seamen; (2) that, by hanging it on,to the drpft convention for the eight hours&apos; day and forty-eight hours1 week, the Conference, without&apos;committing itself to any definite view,, meant that in deciding what the regulation should be the -eight hours&apos; day and forty-eight&apos; hours1 week should bo the guiding principle:, to be approximated to as nearly as prac-tliable.;, but (3). that the whole question was to be left over to the special shomen&apos;s Conference, A Government which &quot;ratifies the Convention is committed to the principle of regulation on those &apos; linos., nothing more; is perfectly froe to take what line it please, at the Genoa confer on go,as to the actual regulations and will also be frre to accept or reject the conclusions which may bo adopted by that Conference...( Signed)    GEORGIA N, BARNES..
