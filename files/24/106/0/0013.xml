ti 0Vfith reference to .Cabinet .28 (20) Conclusion 1,, .. the Conference considered the Cabinet&apos;s request that if possible an amendment to Clause 4 of the Agriculture Bill should be drafted with a -&quot;lew to safeguarding the State against an indefinite rise in wages following on -and causing a further rise in prices and wages, and also the suggestion that this end might be obtained by correlating the guaranteed home price with the world price of cereals. ,The Minister of Agriculture stated that after most careful consideration he had come to the conclusion that it was impracticable to- draft a proviso to Clause 4 on the lines contemplated by the Cabinet.   He pointed out that there would be no logical justification for imposing any arbitrary maximum limitations, and that to dob   so would not only raise intense suspicion on the part of agriculturists who would assume that the Government was taking away with one hand what they were giving with the other, but would also create difficulties in the House of Commons which would assume that any maximum figures inserted in the proviso presupposed the extent- of the losses which the Government anticipated would ha^e to be met.Lord Lee fully realised the Chancellor of theExechequer&apos;s difficulties and said that the only practicableliabilitymethods of lightening the. Treasury/appeared to be (1) by striking out barley from the Bill, (2) by dropping the four years&apos; guarantee. .In the case of barley the Agricultural interests had not pressed for Its inclusion though this had been recommended by the Royal Commission,   There would be little real discontent if barley was omitted and yet the relief would be Important as the contingent liability on barley was very nearly as &quot;heavy as that on wheat.- . Moreover,. barley was not included In the guarantees -of the Corn Production Act,1917,
With regard to the four years proviso this had&quot;been specially recommended by the Royal Commission and was considered of great importance by the Agricultural interests. At the same time, Lord Lee stated that in his opinion the guarantee amounted, in fact, to little more than a pious expression of what is due to the farmer, as it was impossible to bind a future Parliament.   The signs pointed to the continuance of high prices in the near future and it is *rery improbable that the liabilities under the Bill would mature for a long time, if e^er,, The -Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the concessions outlined were considerable but did not meet the main objection raised by the Cabinet, namely; that under the bill the farmer had no incentive to keep dovm the cost of production.   He agreed, however, with the great difficulty of demising any form of words to meet the point and felt that in the&apos;long run agricultural wages must be governed by the general level of industrial wages.The Conference felt grave doubts about the desirability of dropping the four years&apos; guarantee.   Apart from other objections, it was pointed out that the existence of such a guarantee would make it much more difficult for a future Parliament to reverse the legislation in as much as it was generally recognised that &quot;parliamentary bargains&quot; should be carried out.In reply to a suggestion that oats should be omitted from the Bill,   Lord Lee thought that there would be very great difficulty, especially in Scotland, if,the Government went back on the Royal Commissions recommendations in this respect.Ultimately the Committee decided;-.To omit barley from the Bill but otherwise to leave the Bill unaltered.The Committee also,.agreed that Mr,Baldwin. : and Sir A.Gr if f ith-rBos cawen should draft the Financial Resolution as tightly as
possible so as to secure that it was not wider than necessary to sor^e the purposes of the Ministry of Agriculture.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 19th May, 1920.
