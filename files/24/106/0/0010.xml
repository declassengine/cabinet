(P 3938)    From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, Vlih May 1920.(Received .17th, 9 p.m.)610 S. . Mussoorie Conference. Following telegram - from Dobbs, 28 .S., dated 13th May:-&quot; At Tarsi&apos;s request he met him, Chulam Muhammad and Abdul Hadi informally this morning to hear result of his discussions at Jalalabad (corrupt group) regarding frontier incidents with Amir on telephone and with Nadir Khan and other Afghan frontier officials in person. With regard to Chaman incident, Abdul Hadi said that was settled. &apos; With regard to Chitral, there had been no incursion by regulars, but only by adherents of Abdul Rahman. Latter would now be ordered to withdraw, although Abdul Hadi said they had to complain of&quot; acts of aggression by Chitral, which he did not specify. With regard to alleged payments to Afridis by Nadir Khan for the purpose of committing mischief in British territory, these were denied, but it was admitted Nadir enrolled Afridis in Afghan regular Army. With regard to Tandisar, Abdul Hadi said a few Afghan irregulars had for some time after signing of Peace Treaty continued in occupation of spur(s) inside British territory, to retention of which Afghans attached importance as defensive measure. Latterly these irregulars, replaced by regulars. Afghan delegates at first attempted to justify this encroachment by argument that we had unjustly included Torkham in our boundary after Peace Treaty. I exposed fallacy of this argument by quoting Rawalpindi discussions, in which Grant and Matfey distinctly announced before Treaty was signed our intention to include Torkham in our territory (corrupt group) had been contemplated by pro-visions of Treaty, and we could not continue discussions until Tandisar was evacuated. Tarsi then said he hoped we could give them some purda handsomely for this evacua-tion, and more especially suggested we might give (corrupt group) assurance we would not ourselves occupy Tandisar ridge. 1 said I must reflect on this, and that possibly, to avoid appearance of provocation, we might arrange.not to occupy during Mussoorie Conference Tandisar which we do not normally occupy, ;,but I should have to consult Viceroy on this point. Abdul Hadi here interposed and said they must have more quid pro quo than this, namely, undertaking to abstain from operations in Waziristan during&apos; Conference. He said Amir had meant such abstention to be condition of preliminary meeting of Conference. I refused to give such assurance and advised them to reflect on futility of making whole Conference to discuss mis-understandings depend on agreement regarding one point. Abdul Hadi said they had no power to waive this point. I then closed discussion, and Tarsi said ho would send me letter formulating their requests. It seems probable that they will insist on assurance that operations in Waziristan shall be suspended before agreeing to evacuate Tandisar, in which case Conference must close and Afghan delegates leave India. Tarsi himself wishes, I think, not to insist on W^aziristan formula, but Abdul Hadi evidently has distinct orders from Kabul on the point.&quot;
