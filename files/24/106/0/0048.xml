With regard to forthcoming meeting with German government at Spa, the British Government have had under consideration question &apos;of. representation of Dominion interests.     The Conference with theGermans is not summoned for revision of Treaty;   its primary purpose is to request Germans to explain past infractions of the Treaty andto make arrangements for its future execution.     At the same time aserious attempt will be made to fix liabilities of Germany under thehead of reparation. ,   All authorities agree that this is vital equalsto the Allies and Germany.     If Germany is to be in a position topay reparation, she requires to know her exact liabilities and it isequally ^0 ^e Allied interest to know what exactly they can expect.This is the only way in which they can raise immediate credits onreparationsecurity of Germany1s prospective/payments.   Of course this proeeed-ing is entirely in-accordance with the terms of protocol of the Peace Treaty, and the letter written to the Germans on behalf of the Allies on June l6th, 1919, but it directly affects all the Dominions as it concerns the amount of reparation payable by Germany. Finally, the Germans will almost certainly raise other questions, such as an increase in the military strength allowed to Germany beyond that provided for in the Peace Treaty itself, upon which wo may feel that we should make concessions.   For instance, on this matter
- 2 -all our expert&quot;advice.seems to agree that-it ^ill 1^ i^ Germany to maintain internal.-order with only 100,000 men.Hie Majesty1 b Government are therefore very anxious that, the Governments of the Dominions should, if possible, appoint some plenipotentiary to attend meetings of a British Empire Delegation to diseuss these questions.   They do not see any other way in which*effective consultation car take place, except by making use of thesome machinery which existed during the War and the Peace Conferenceand which it was decided at onr of the later meetings of the imperial war Cabinet to maintain in existence in case the Dominions wished toavail themselves, of it.     It is clearly impossible for the AlliedGovernments to refer all their decisions for confirmation of all the signatories of the Peace Treaty before they can come into effect.   Thatis required in Europe now is prompt decision if hundreds of thousands of people are not to perish from disorder and famine.   Delay in arriving at conclusions now must precipitate Europe into chaos.   Inthe opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, the only practicalaourso is to reconstitute the British Empire Delegation in some formand that the Dominions should accredit a plenipotentiary in Londonv,ho oan watch over their interests and represent their views, duringthe discussions.   The Conference with the Germans was in the. firstinstance fixed for Hay 25th, but. I think it is practically certain nowto be put off for a month, as the German general elections take placeon June. 6th, and it will be better to deal with a now German Govern-ment than with one which will perhaps disappear a fortnight later.I should be glad, therefore, to know whether you agree to thiscourse and, if so, whom you nominate to represent Canad?xAustralia Few Zealand Union of South Africa.To Australia only ( This should present no difficulty in the oasc ofAustralia beuauoc I see from Kr, Hughes&apos; speech of March.4-th that Mr. Watt is authorised to represent the Australian Government on this question. )      Ends.KILMER.
May 17th*I am asked by my Prime Minister to convey to you for transmission to the Imperial Prime Minister tho following reply to latter^s  mossago contained in your telegram of the 12th May.    Mr. Massey concurs in proposed mooting at Spa and tho necessity for arriving at prompt conclusions.    Ho regrets that it is impossible for him to be present owing to tho mooting next month of the Hew Zealand Parliament and for other reasons which need not bo enumerated.&apos;   He desires however to say that Sir James Allen who until recently was Minister of Defence in Hew Zealand is on the way to London now to take up the position of High Commissioner for Hew Zealand and should he arrive in time for the proposed conference at Spa this Government Gosires that he should represent New Zealand. If not, Mr. Massey  would be grateful if the Secretary of State for the Colonies would be so kind as to under-cake himself the duty of representing Hew Zealand at tho conference.LIVERPOOLIIII..PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Governor General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Questions to be dealt with concern high policy which could only be discussed by Ministers speciallys ent from here and by present session of Parliament Union Govern-ment are- prevented from sending one of their members for the purpose to Europe.     You will understand the general view taken by the Union Government of the main points calling for settle-men t at Spa from the attitude taken by the late-General Botha as well as myself at the Paris Peace Conference.months have only served to give additional force to the con-siderations which at Paris we urged in favour of a policy of moderation in dealing with the questions now in issue.   In Central Europe the Governmental and economic unsettlement has steadily increased and may unless arrested eventually involve the rest of Europe.
