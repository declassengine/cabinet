SECRET.THE CABINET.^i^fAh PRESENT CONDITION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OPRUSSIAN INDUSTRIES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate, herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a short summary which has been prepared by the Military Intelligence Directorate on the present condition and future prospects of industries in Russia.W. S. C.The Wae Office.mh May, 1920.1. The destruction of Russian industry dates from October, 1917. The war had rendered the position of Russian industries very uncertain, and they were very badly affected by the disorganization and destruction which took place after the revolution of October, 1917.   The factors contributing to the destruction of industries were : (i.) Closing down of the factories, (ii.) Plundering the factories.(hi.) Flight of the better class of workmen to the country, (iv.) Destruction of the production and technical personnel.2. Attempt at Re-establishment. The results of the chaos were demonstrated when attempts at re-establishment were made. No one knew what products were required or in what quantities. The factories had no productive programmes and no financial knowledge. The conditions of life of the remaining workmen demanded that immediate steps should be taken on the financial side and supply of materials. The schemes drawn up by the Government were &quot; convulsive &quot; and naturally failed to work. As an example, twelve factories in one centre received orders to repair locomotives. None of these factories succeeded in securing a single locomotive for repair, as the railway authorities distributed the damaged engines among their - own workshops. The Government had taken over the administration of the factories and had to support them financially, consequently as work grew less and less, the workmen became the pensioners of the Government, as their pay did not in the least depend on work performed. This naturally killed all working capacity. The attempt to re-establish the industries by the formation of trusts was doomed to failure under the existing conditions.The working man could not possibly earn sufficient to satisfy his requirements owing to the colossal rise in prices and the depreciation in value of paper money. The Government, therefore, attempted to pay the men in rations and necessary articles, instead of in worthless paper money. This failed, as it was not possible to supply a workman with more than a half-pound of bread daily. Recource is now had to the &quot; Self-Supporting Scheme,&quot; in other words, food expeditions to the country by the workmen. This is now one of the chief r61es of the factories.3. Actual industrial situation. The complete moral decomposition amongst the workmen negatives all attempts at either discipline or increase of production. Great discontent is caused by attempting compulsorily to improve output while at the same time failing to satisfy the elementary demands of the workmen.Strikes are naturally likely to occur, and although they never appeared in the Press there were large strikes in July and August, 1919, at the Russian Sormovskiya Kulibinskiya factories and in Petrograd, during January and February, 1920, at Putiloff and Obuhovskiya factories. The absence of the technical personnel makes it impossible to reconstruct an efficient factory organization.Actual work of various undertakings. It is interesting to note that between the years 1917 1919, the earnings per pood increased in cast-steel 32 times, in cast-iron(E20/236)   100   5/20   H&amp;S  8230wo
28 times, and in forge 25 times, while the average production of all factories fell to 36 per cent, of the 1917 figure. One of the largest factories in the Northern District before the war employed 10,000 to 15,000 men. At the present moment it is employing 1,500 men. During the last few months its monthly budget has increased to 5,000,000 roubles, whereas its work was the repair of four locomotives, 20 railway carriages, and the manufacture of a small stock of military stores. On the railways the increase in personnel is very marked. On the Northern Railways, between 1914-1919, the number of men employed per verst rose from 67 to 580. On the Moscow Kazan it rose from 198 to 475, and on the Moscow Kursk from 648 to 1,890. Such increases in personnel naturally caused financial difficulties, the more so since it was unjustified by actual necessity, and the yearly expense of one employee in roubles rose between the years 1913-1919 from 310 to 6,870 roubles.To compare this return with the expense, it is to be noted that between the years 1913-1918 the expenses rose from 805 to 18,762. The figures for 1919 are unknown. It is interesting to note that the returns have decreased in comparison with former years.   This is a direct result of the transport destruction.4. Future possibilities. The following are the principal points to consider before Russia can improve her industrial future : a.) All kinds of fuel must be provided.b.) Reconstruction and development to acquire raw materials, firstly metallic, secondly, textile.(c.) Reconstruction of all transport and organization of railway construction. (d.) Settlement of the labour question.(e.) Receipt of enormous quantities of foreign capital. The minimum requirements for the reconstruction of transport, supply of raw materials and fuel will be 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 roubles yearly for a period of from 8 to 10 years.Such a wide introduction of foreign capital presents grave economic dangers for Russia, and the only solution to such a problem can be found by a Government which receives the support of the people.
