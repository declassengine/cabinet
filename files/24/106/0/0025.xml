For the week ended J,5th May 1920,BALTIC&amp;   NORTH RUSSIA.H.M.S, &quot;Sesame&quot;, with members of the Aeronautical Commis-sion of Control, sailed from Danzig on 7th and arrived at Stolpmunde on 8th and at Copenhagen on 9th.     &quot;Sesame&quot; left Copenhagen again on .10th and proceeded to Warnemunde.S-Sc. &quot;D0HG0LA&quot; has arrived at HelsingXors and has embarked 180 British, 115 French and 5 Russians for Southampton and 33 Danes for Copenhagen-,     wDongcla&quot;j, escorted by &quot;Veteran&quot;, sailed from Helsingfors on the 14th for Copenhagen, whence &quot;Dongola- proceeds unescorted to Southampton.Soviet F3.eet - Amended Instructions to SoH,0,,Acting on a Cabinet decision of 5th May,, Lord Curzon wired -co Chicherin on 7th May., stating that in accordance with Allied decision of ?,$th February 192C. he warns the Soviet Government that if any aggression on the part of the Soviet Fleet against the : ordering States is attempted, it will be considered as an hostile act, and the British Fleet will receive orders to support the State attacked,     Jhicherin replied 10th Hay expressing astonishment and stating that they were at a loss to&apos;understand to which Soviet Fleet the telegram retorredrThe following is a paraphrase of a telegram sent to SoB&apos;*0* Baltic, on 15th May&quot;Section 5     Genera], Policy - of A0L0]/lc 0139.1 paras. 1 and. 2 should be cancelled and the following substituted. Begins,   Bolshevik Naval aggression against the Baltic States is to be looked upon as offensive action and, in such ease, you are authorised to take action against the Soviet Fleet.     Before you take action., however,, it must be quite clear that a definite hostile act has been committed by the Soviet Fleet.     Ends0&quot;On receipt of this te3.egram3 S*N.0o Baltic asked whether a Light Cruiser should be maintained at Helsingfors.     He was informed that this icas not necessary.It is stated that owing to peace with Esthonia Esthonian sailors are being discharged from the Bolshevik Fleet.       Officers of Esthonian origin in the Fleet are also endeavouring to demobilise themselves;   owing to this the Bolsheviks are experiencing a great shortage of naval personnels     Only two of the destroyers under repair have been completed,, the third having lost her propeller shaft on trialn     It is rumoured that the Onega Lake Flotilla is again being liquidated and the Officers sent South,,    SoNcO* Baltic reports 17th May that six torpedo boats and one cruiser, unknown - type 4,.. carried out firing exercises sea from Kronstadt on 3.1th May,Visit of HbM. Ships to Riga.SoKoOo Baltic has been informed -that it is not desirable for HoM, Ships to visit Riga unless absolutely imperative, onaccount of the clanger from mines *   He has also been instructed to obtain from the Esthonian Government full details cf the buoyage en route Liba\v-E,eval; as will enable a Hot ice to Mariners to be published.Evacuation
Evacuation of Flensbmrg.The date of evacuation i3 not yet fixed.       It is understood that Sir Charles Marling is shortly to visit the Foreign Office in regard to this question.Trade.Jour Bolshevik delegates,- Nogin, Klishko, Razovsky and son, arrived in England on 11th May to carry on proposals with the Economic Council.     M. Krassin remains in Copenhagen.   He is very anxious that, should he proceed to England. Litvinov should remain in Denmark, as he fears intrigue should Litvinov return to Moscow &quot;before the delegation.   Foreign Office has wired to Copenhagen stating that Krassin&apos;s presence in England is necessary, and that the Soviet Government will be required to give guarantees of good faith, especially as at the present moment they are actively engaged in hostility to British interests and in conspiring with the enemies of Great Britain, They are also withholding British nationals and news concerning British prisoners of war taken in Siberia and South Russia.s.s. &quot;OLGA&quot;.     The French Government has requested that this ship o&quot;e sent as&quot; she stands to Brest.     C-in-C Rosyth was instruc-ted to prepare the 3hip for sea, but reported that it would be dangerous for her to proceed except in very calm weather, owing to risk of disaster due to shifting cargo.     Consequently the I? r en oh Government has been informed and asked for an urgent reply as to .whether they still wish the ship fce sent to Brest or the ammunition destroyed.&quot;KITOBOI&quot;, It. Sablin, Russian Representative in London;has replied to Foreign Office letter that Admiral Cowan&apos;s loan deed is not recognised as a binding agreement, and appeals from a point of sentiment that the Russians be allowed to retain the vessel.     The question is now under consideration by the Admiralty.Esthonia.     The Inter-Allied Military Mission of Versailles communicated to the Ambassadors&apos; Council copies of correspondence with regard to sending the remnants of the late North West army, amounting to 2500 men, from Esthonia to Serbia.     The Council was asked to obtain permission for them to pass via Danzig and Hungary.     The Council agreed to ask for this permission, Poland having apparently already given their consent.Latvia,   pease negotiations with Soviet continue.     Although the work of the sub-commissions is proceeding smoothly, the Soviet persist in their demands to the Southern Sector of frontier for direct communication with Lithuania, and Letts see no prospect for settlement.     Due to the polish offensive, new demands are being put forward.     The soviet demands are armistice terminable at two months&apos; notice, and unqualified Lettish neutrality.     The Letts offered local neutrality that would include, for example, port facilities.Lithuania.     Lithuania ha3 opened peace negotiations with Russia, but th&quot;ere&quot; is no information as to the progress made.     Report-3 are being circulated that another Bermont adventure against Poland is being prepared in Germany with hope of the co-operation of the Lithuanians,     The Council of Ambassadors in Paris on 8th May refused the request of the Lithuanian Government for per-mission to purchase German ?;ar material.League of Nations.   The Soviet agree in principle to a visit by representatives of the League of Nations to Russia, but refuse temporarily in view of the fact, according to their statement, that several members of the League are actively supporting Poland in their war against the Soviet.     Press reports that British Labour Delegation arrived at Petrograd on Tuesday 11th May.Finland.
Finland.   At a meeting of the Council of Ambassadors in Paris on 8th May, Lord Derby suggested that a Note should be presented to Finland by the Allied Representatives at Helsingfors, similar to that recently presented to neutral Governments adjacent to Germany on the subject of the export of German war material contrary to the terms of the Peace Treaty.     Mr Kidston (Helsingfors) wired 14th May that the Soviet had on 11th May approached the Finnish Government to enter again into pour-parlers for the conclusion of a treaty of peace.   The Finnish government are considering reply.     Press reported on 15th May that the Finnish Government had accepted the invitation, and this has also now been officially confirmed.     The Autonomy Bill for the Aaland Islands, with slight modifications from former Bill, has been passed by the Finnish Diet.     Mr Barclay (Stock-holm) states that at a dinner at which the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs and Finnish representative to Sweden were present the Swedish Minister suggested a plebiscite on the basis of self-determination, to take place in 2 - 3 years if the Finnish Government so desire it.     The Finnish Minister refused absolutely to entertain such a proposal.     The Swedish Minister states that the question is entering a critical stage and the Aalanders refuse to accept autonomy, and will probably bring matters to a head by declaring themselves incorporated with Sweden.     If the Finnish Government attempted reprisals, Swedish public opinion would not tolerate such action, ?,:,id the question is one which should be at once taken up by the Supreme Council.&apos;The two Coastal Motor Boats at Copenhagen, earmarked for Finland, are being returned to England in the &quot;War Pathan&quot;. S.N.0. Baltic suggests that the proposals be withdrawn, but Admiralty has directed that the question of the disposal of these C,M.B&apos;s is to be raised later; it has been finally decided to close negotiations with the Finns,Kara Sea Relief Expedition.     Press reports that the &quot;Sviatogor&quot; sailed from Bergen on 14th May.   No confirmation has been received from official sources.Internal conditions of Russia.     Moscow has been, strangely silent during the week but has now again commenced sending wireless messages.     Several reasons were put forward, one being that Brussilov had attempted a coup d&apos;etat.     A report has come through that on 10th May severe explosions took place at the Koroschevo Military Depot.     All necessary steps to deal with the outbreak were taken.     It is suggested that it was due to polish Agent3.     Ho improvement is reported in the chaotic state of railways and industries&apos;.     Reliable information points to a break in the Soviet Camp.     Lenin is inclined to give concessions and states that the people must be satisfied with the present realisation of Socialist ideas.    They are very keen on making a general peace and their views were received with enthusiasm at a large meeting.   The second party, led by Dzerjinsky and Trot3ky, demand that no break from Communist ideals should be attempted. At Petrograd Zinoviev&apos;s party clamours for war against FiaaldH-Finland, but Finnish Reds in Russia state that this would be courting a crushing defeat.   W/T reports a special Army Council composed of old regime Generals to advise a plan of campaign to resist Polish aggression.     W/T message is signed by Trotsky and Kamenev.     The general feeling in Russia is said to be growing against Soviet rule.     Two British refugees lately returned from Russia have challenged Mr Lansbury to a debate on the internal conditions of Russia to be held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on 31st May.MEDITERRANEAN
Plume.As a result of the fall of the Italian Government the Adriatic negotiations talcing place at Pallanza between Jugo-Slavia and Italy are suspended and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, S. Scialoja, returned t^Rome, and the Jugo-Slav deputation, M.M. Pasitch and Tnimbitch, have left.Much had been hoped i  these negotiations, in view of the conciliatory disposition of both Governments, and an agree-ment on the following basis was in sight(a) Recognition of Italian sovereignty over Fiume.(b),Renunciation by Italy of.the claim to a Corridor connecting Italy with Fiume. .(t). Intemationalisation of the Port of Fiume&apos;.The arux of the negotiations, however, was the Island of Cherso, Italy being most anxious to acquire it in order to main-tain contact with Fiume by sea,     Thi towns of this island are Italian but the countryside is Slav,Northern Syria and Cilicia.   A telegram dated May 1st has been addressed to the British Prime Sinister from Aintab stating that British subjects, Americans and Armenians have been under Turkish fire for four weeks;   that the situation in Cilicia is desperate and the-French forces are inadequate.     American missionaries ; who arrived at Beyrout oh May 1st confirmed this statement, repoting the situation to be extremely..dangerous.. .   The Turks are Said to:have artillery, with&apos; which they began-to bombard the Christian quarter on April 29th,: vAn American who left Mer3ina on May 2nd reports the situation at Adana was then quiet.     He also reported a French column of 3,000 men had been sent to Borejjik and that fighting continued &apos;at Aintab. ,,&apos; .Ukraine. .    The Poles have consolidated their positions on the left &quot;bank of the Dnieper near Kiev..    All attempts by the Bolsheviks to *etake the positions have failed, even though Red . JPeath Battalions were used in the Attack.     Reinforcements are being sent, and Budenie*s cavalry, recently operating in the Kuban, are reported to have crossed the Dnieper between Ekaterinealev and Alexandrovsk.     There is as yet no confirmation of the fall of Odessa from people coming from that district, although trouble is reported with the peasants outside, the town. A report has been received that the French Destroyer HLA SCARPS&quot; in attempting to enter the River Bug, proceeding to IJikolaev,was fired on by the Bolsheviks batteries at Ochakov and disabled. Casualties, 4 killed and 12 wounded.     The French Destroyer &quot;Mangini&quot; and ,,an Italian Destroyer were proceeding to her assistance.    (uManginiM has since arrived at Constantinople from Sevastopol^.Crimea.   The situation generally in the Crimea is quiet.   In the Sea of Azov, Volunteer ships blew up dump at Mariupol, sank several ships near Yeisk and Taganrog, and also bombarded villages on the coast in Pea?ki Perikop Bay and enemy positions on Taman peninsula.     On 9th May the Bolsheviks raided Chuchak across Siwash but were repulsed.     Volunteer aeroplanes bombed Genichesk damaging boats and rolling stock.   Bolshevik artillery active near Perikop.     General Wrangel has asked for assistance to again make an effective force of General Bredov*s Army, interned in Poland, numbering 15 to 20,000 strong.    This does not agra?e with previous information, which stated that early in March Bredov with 5,000 arrived in Poland, but that only 1,000 were interned the others declaring their intention of joining the Bolsheviks in preference to being disarmed.   A reply has been sent that H.M^ Government cannot possibly intervene in this matter.   Volunteertroops
troops along Black Sea Coast have been evacuated from Adlert belt there is no information as to numbers or whether those evacuated include the whole of the Bon and Kuban Cossacks who were operating against the Reds in the Sochi district.Armistice Negotiations,     In answer to Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram of Tv&amp;ilky, &quot;cHIcherin replied on 7th May that the Soviet Government are ready to meet in the largest measure the wishes of the British Government.     They are ready to negotiate at once a suspension of hostilities on the Crimean front, with a view to a speedy con-clusion of a special agreement with Great Britain, regarding a general amnesty for those still opposing Soviet authority.     They agree to General Wrangells participation in the pourparlers and a British representative, provided that Great Britain takes the necessary steps for w&quot;rangel&apos;s participation.   As regards the Cau-casus, Chicherin points out that military operations in that sector have been suspended and proposals made with adjacent Governments that peace negotiations be opened immediately.     Chicherin con-cludes that, in thus agreeing to the wishes of Great Britain, it will be a preliminary step to a general agreement between Russia and Great Britain.     No reply to this has yet been sent.   Mean-while, General Wrangel, evidently impressed by the Polish advance requested that the following be pointed out to H.M, Government -(1)   That on 2nd April, when agreeing to British invitation that an armistice be arranged, he pointed out the impossibility of entering into direct negotiations with the enemy.(2)   Recognising the difficult situation of the Kuban Force, he released the Ataman Bukretov and authorised him to treat directly with the Bolsheviks, and that one of the terms is that Cossacks should proceed against Poles.(3)   To facilitate negotiations he proposed to send a special delegation to London, fully acquainted with the present situation and his intentions.(4)     He suggests that a nucleus be formed of Crimean Army, and that he is inspired by hope, which he still cherishes, of reconstitution of Russia with the aid of the Allies.   He places solution in the hands of the powers.The above is in direct contradiction to Allied policy which is that the struggle should not be prolonged, and terms arranged-with Soviet as soon as possible.Evacuation of Novoro3sisk.   A letter has been sent to the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs  drawing attention to the situation in South Russia.     Their Lordships have wired the C-in-C Mediterranean conveying an expression of their appreciation of the services rendered by the officers and men of H.M. Ships concerned in the evacuation of Novorossisk.C-in-C Mediterranean returned to Constantinople in 11 Iron Luke&quot; on the 15th-May.Batoum.   The French have detailed a battalion of Algerian Tirailleurs (Black) for Batoum.     Lord Derby has been instructed to point out to the French Government that M. Millerand definitely promised at San Remo that a White Battalion should be sent, and that this promise should be carried out.   A Black battalion would do more harm than good at Batoum.     An Italian Brigade wa3 expected daily (10th May) at Constantinople.    It is not known whether this brigade should supply the Italian Battalion for Batoum and the Italian Government has been asked to state definite-ly whether it is to do so.       In view of the situation at Constan-tinople no extra British troops should be despatched to Batoum from the Straits.     G,0oC, Army of Black Sea states that commerce of Batoum province is at a standstill owing to stoppage of trade. In view of Cabinet decision that we are to remain in Batoum aslong
long a3 possible, instructions are requested as to how it is pro* posed to feed the population.     Monthly estimates of flour being&apos;&apos; 600 tons: the population can pay in roubles for the present, but this may not be possible as- unemployment increases.   On 10th May the Georgians commenced to attack the Adjarians, Mussulman inhabitants of Batoum Province.   These are now fighting for their homes.     G.O.C. Batoum is sending troops to maintain order and.is reducing the stocks of ammunition reserve by leading &quot;PENP0LM.; He considers that to give arms to Georgia under present conditions would be madness and can see no way of getting them to the Armenians, who will, in all probability, a3 security against the Turks also turn BolshevikAzerbaijan.     No communication between Tiflis and Baku exists. Commander Luke RNVR wires that there is no further information regardingthe Naval Mission, and that no steps to obtain their re-lease can be undertaken from that end, unless he is authorised to threaten reprisals to the Azerbaijan Soviet.     These could hardly be carried into effect and so would lose their value. Sir Percy Cox (Teheran) wires that a Persian asthe recently returned from Baku states that all Foreign Missions except the Persian, had been arrested and were not.being well treated.The Azerbaijan Government presented an ultimatum (1.5.20) to Armenia demanding the withdrawal of Armenian Regulars from Karabagh and Zangezur, failing which Azerbaijan troops will invade Armenia.A further ultimatum from the Bolshevik Committee for South Russia demanded compliance with these demands, failing which Soviet Russia would as3ist Azerbaijan.These ultimatums have been rejected.The Armenian Government recognises the necessity for defend-ing itself, but almost entirely lacks the means to do so, and on 4.5.20 sent a message to the Azerbaijan Soviet, and a copy to Moscow, asking for a cessation of hostilities aimd the opening of negotiations regarding frontier disputes.There is no definite news of the offensive against Armenia having commenced, but reports of large concentrations of Soviet troops between petrovsk and Derbent have been received.     The notorious Enver Pasha is reported to be in Baku and about to take over command of the Azerbaijan Army.Reports have reached Constantinople of negotiations between the Soviet Government and the Dashnakzontian party of Erivan which assumed authority on the resignation of the Khatis3ian Government, according to which Armenia is to place her foreign affairs   under the Soviet Government&apos;s control, but is to be allowed freedom as regards internal- affairs.   She is also to be assisted, with force if necessary, to obtain from Turkey      the provinces of Van and Ezerum, part of Bitlis and a Black Sea Port. ,   Such&apos;commitments on the part of the Armenian Government seem unlikely.Georgia.     Chicherin declares that Soviet Government have no aggressive intentions against Georgia, but desire information as to the territorial boundaries of that state and attitude which will be adopted to the remnants of the Volunteer Army.     Georgia replied, giving territorial limits, and that they had? always been in conflict with the Volunteer Army, and any who had entered Georgian territory had been disarmed and interned.     It was further pointed out that acts of hostility had been committed against the Georgian Mission by the Soviet Authorities both at Baku and Vladikavkaz.     Commander Luke has been, informed that Georgian representative,   in London has appealed for despatch of arms to Georgia.     His views have been requested on (l) whether Gxrgia will turn Bolshevik and these arms fall into Soviet hands. (2) How payment will be effected, and (3) Whether Georgians acquired any arms from Volunteer Army refugees.     No progress is being made with regard to co-operation between Georgia and Armenia;    the Georgians mistrust the Armenians, as a Bolshevik outbreak at Tiflis on 3rd May was led by Armenian Bolsheviks.
0 fi 0 0There are reports that a deputation has gone to Vladikavkaz to arrange terms with Soviet.     Later reports state that Georgia has signed peace and that Tiflis was beflagged, but that mobilisation continues which is not a success.     The Turks are stated to have ceded Batoura Borchalinsk and Zakatai to Georgia and that Brest Litov3k peace has been renounced.   Georgia has also been invited to send representatives to Baku to negotiate peace terms between Georgia and Azerbaijan.Caspian.   Several guns from the Caspian Fleet have been landed at Enzelf,     The internees number 1,136 Russians, 210 Armenians. These are being removed to Kasvin.     War Office has been requested to obtain definite information of the fate of the 12 C.U.B&apos;S turned over to the Caspian Fleet in August 1919, of which 6 are reported at Enzeli,Siberia.   H..1.S. &quot;Carlisle&quot; left Vladivostock without relief on 4th May for Hong Kong.     War Office state that arrangements have been made for the withdrawal of the British Military Mission (33 Officers and 34 other ranks) from Siberia.    They are reported to have sailed from Vladivostock on 12th May.     General Janin, French ( -in-C. of Czech troops, is reported to have sailed for France, The Russian Volunteer ship &quot;orel&quot; Is reported to have arrived at Calcutta 12th May from Singapore with 300 cadets.   The &quot;YAKUT&quot; sailed from Singapore for Colombo on 7th May.Turkey.     The Government is concentrating on the anti-nationalist campaign in the Ismid area, where satisfactory progress is being made.    Suleiman Shefik Pasha has been appointed C* in C. there and commands a special force of Government troops with which he in-tends to advance along the Anatolian railway. Thrace is quiet.Smyrna is quiet, but the Greeks are nervous regarding a reported nationalist concentration, subsequent to the fall of Anzavur, of 15r000.The arrival of an Italian brigade is expected at Constan-tinople daily and will be located at Stamboul,A report on the subject of Bolshevik tendencies in Turkey covering a period of investigation of six months sums up the present situation as follows:- In Constantinople itself there is no proper connection between the Turks and the Bolsheviks.   A certain amount of propaganda has been carried on by the latter among the lowest classes in the capitalt but there is no evidence of any organised movement in favour of an understanding.     In Asia Minor however, tentative pourparlers have undoubtedly taken place between Mustapha kemal and the Soviet Government.   Attempts to come to a real understanding however, have not been very serious as each side mistrusts the other.     On the whole the only agreement likely to be reached will be a compromise whereby the one party may help the other if and when occasion arises, without incurring any further responsibility.DANUBE.Int. ernationa]. Commi s si on.The following resolution is under consideration by the Council of Ambassadors&quot;As soon as the Hungarian Treaty (handed to the Hungarian Delegation on the 5th instant) has been signed summonses for the constitution and meeting of the International Commission of the Danube, provided for by Art.347 of the Treaty of Versailles, shall be sent to the Powers concerned.   At the same time the suggestion shall be made that these Powers shall retain in their delegations their present representatives on the Temporary Inter-AlliedDanube
Danube Commission, so that there may be no interruption or alters-tyon of a nature likely to affect adversely traffic on the Danube, The first meeting to take place on 17th June next., it being assumed that the Hungarian Treaty will have been signed by then&quot;.Captain B,V/.L. Nicholson, DSO, RN, who will be naval adviser to the British Representative on the Danube Conference to assemble in Paris on August 1st next,, is proceeding to Galatz to attehdthe Session of the European Commission which opens on the 17th inst. and will subsequently proceed up the Danube, studying conditions on the river and the work of Admiral Troubridge&apos;$Commission en route.Captain Warton. S,N,0* British Danube Flotilla, is at Galatz acting as deputy for Colonel Baldwin on the Old European Danube Commission, and will return to Novi Sad on the 18th instant0Admiral Troubridge has arrived in Paris and is presiding over a series of meetings of the Temporary Inter-Allied Danube Commission.Captain Bowring has completed a tour of inspection of the Lower Danube Ports and of Constanta and has visited the   existing Naval Establishments, Arsenal and Workshops.   He was to1 commence a tour of the upper waters of the Danube on the 10th instant.His report emphasises the following points ... 1.    There appears to be an entire absence of engine roompersonnel capable of dealing with monitors or destroyers, 2yConstanta is the only port on which a destroyer flotilla couldbe usefully based, but a great deal requires to be done thereto fit it for the reception of even a small number of torpedoC Tc/jX &apos;G ,3,     line sanitary conditions in the existing naval establish-ments are extremely bad.Rumanian naval officers, both high and low, are permeated with unbounded optimism and with cocksureness as to their ability to learn in a few months and to perform satisfactorily any and every type of naval duty.     They have no conception of the high degree of technical training required for the satisfactory main-tenance of modern vessels,RED   SEA.Arabia..     The Foreign Office has informed Lord Allenby that it is nut proposed to proceed with the proposal to invite King Hussein to London,     It has now been suggested that the Emir Abdullah should be invited to London in a private capacity to discuss the situation,GERMANY.The present situation in Kiel is reported by the Inter-Allied Fortifications Committee there to be as follows;-The town is controlled by a &quot;Civil Governor&quot;, a Member of the Majority Socialist Party, to which all the local administratives belong.   He is assisted by a Military Governor and Naval Petty Officers-! in all matters connected with the Navy.   This combination appears to carry on without reference to Berlin, though they are nominal].y representing the Central Government,     Order is maintained by blue and green police and there have recently been considerable numbers of workers enlisted into, or anyhow co-operating with the latter.     The workmen1s companies which Were formed during   the Kapp movement, to police Kiel, arc being disbanded as quickly as possible.     Their pay ceased about the 19th instant.   There is no Reichswehr in the place.The Naval Officers to whom the sailors objected have been granted leave with pay till the Government decides what is to bedone.
PORTUGAL.The Minister at Lisbon has been begged to impress upon the British Government the serious situation that will arise there if no shipments of coal arrive from the United Kingdom.    It is con-tended that the railways and tramways will be paralysed, the capital will be in darkness and thousands of men will be thrown out of work, and every encouragement will be given to Bolshevism, which the Government have up to now successfully repressed.MISCELLANEOUS HOMS  INTELLIGENCE.Refusal to load Munitions for Poland.    The London dockers having refused to load a cargo of munitions of war destined for Poland on board the s,s. &quot;Jolly George&quot;, the charter has been cancelled and the steamer loaded a general cargo for Danzig.Work for Chatham Dockyard.   The monitor &quot;Prince Rupert&quot; has arrived from the Humber for conversion into an accommodation hulk in place of the wooden hulks &quot;HELENA&quot; and &quot;CHALLENGER&quot;.(NOTE-.-   It was in the latter vessel that Darwin made his scienti-fic cruise round the world).Pour Adrairalty trawlers of the &quot;Castle&quot; class are to be converted for fishing purposes under the National Fishery Scheme at ChathamMerchant Shipbuilding in Portsmouth Dockyard.     At the meeting of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering j&quot;&quot; Shipbuilding and Construc-tional workers to discuss the Admiralty proposal for a relaxation of ddmarcation rules between Shipbuilding and other Trades in the . building of Merchant ships in the Dockyard, the men voted unanimously in favour of waiving the Trade rules.Do eke rs; Strike, Teeside.   The whole of the Dockers on the Teeside numbering approximately 2000, ceased work on the 12th May on the pretext that the employers have not 3trictly adhered to the recent award of 16/- a day.   The river is full of shipping, and the strike will undoubtedly cause a lot of congestion.H.R.H. Prince Arthur of Connaught. embarked in H.M.S. &quot;Dunedin&quot; at Harwich&quot;on&quot; the 8th May for passage to Stockholm to attend the funeral of the Crown Princess of Sweden,German raider &quot;MCWE&quot;.   Among the vessels which arrived at Rosyth during the week to surrender, was the s.s, &quot;Pungo&quot;, 5602 tons. She was formerly the notorious raider &quot;MoweM, and has been handed over to Messrs Turner. Brightman &amp; Co,, , London.ISurrender of German Warships.    The German Battleships &quot;poson&quot; and &quot;Oldenburg&quot; and the destroyer &quot;V,71&quot; arrived in the Firth of Forth for surrender on May 12th, escorted by H,M. Ships &quot;Queen Eliza-beth&quot;/and &quot;Wolsey&apos;:. &quot;Wools-ton&quot;Saledone with them.     They are nowhere to be seen, some may have left Kiel.A Government communication states that on the 22nd instant (?) representatives of the &quot;Naval authorities&quot; in Kiel and Wilhelrns-haven had a meeting with the Reichawehrminister and th   Admiralty authorities.It was agreed that the Navy could not dispense with officers and that none of those compromised in the Kapp affair could bo reinstated; but it does not appear that any agreement was arrived at which would end the present irregular situation.
Sale of Ex-Gcrrnan wa r sh jp s .     The ex-German Battleship &quot;Nassau11 and two destroyers &quot;V,80&quot; &quot;and &quot;V, 127&quot; allotted to Japan, have been sold by the Japanese Naval Attache to a shipb re axing firm at Middlesborough,   The &quot;Nassau&quot; will be broken up on the Tyne, and the Destroyers at Granton Harbour.Monitors for disposal.   None of the Monitors for disposal in one Huinber have so &quot;far &apos;been removed, and it has now been decided to send them to Chatham or Portsmouth under their own steam.Atlantic PIcct in Irish waters.   Detachments of the Atlantic Fleet have visited the following ports between the 6th and 14th May: Bere Island, Foyncs, Arklow, Wicklow, Kingstown, Baltimore, Castletownshend, Point Lackeen, Valentia, Tralee, Clifden .Wireless Telephony,   In the tests now being carried out on the H,E, Coast by the Marconi Company, wireless telephonic communica-tion has been established between Blyth and Newcastle and speech easily maintained.General Situation in Ireland.   Police murders and attempted murders during the week &quot;show a Tnarked increase.     Attacks on Police Barracks continue unabated and two Government Offices (income Tax Office, Belfast, and the Excise Office at Bantry), were raided, all documents being destroyed.
