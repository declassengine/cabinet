There may be &quot;isolated instances of refusing to load ships, but otherwise it is unlikely that any action v/ill be taken.The claim of the railwaymen is now before the National Wages Board.   Among the important meetings to be held this week is that of I   the Co-ordination Committee, which is working out plans for a S   &quot;General Staff for Labour&quot;.The &quot;Work to Rule&quot; strike appears to be waning but there is stilf    congestion at some of the centres.   Mr. Foot is now concerned in 1 reverting to ordinary methods as unobtrusively as possible. ,The British Socialist Party Delegation to Russia is paid for by I Soviet funds through Theodore Rothstein.There has been a set-back to Sinn Fein activities in England end I] Scotland: a large anti-Sinn Fein demonstration was held in Liverpool.ii        The Conference of Ex-Service men in Geneva has disappointed 1 the extremists.There has been a recrudescence of attempts to tamper with the I loyalty of the troops.   Burgess, the Manager of the &quot;Workers&apos; I Dreadnought&quot;, is being prosecuted.i        At the Co-operative Conference next week an important decision I on the political future of the Society is to be taken.
THE &quot;HANDS OFF RUSSIA&quot; movement the Polish Offensive has been a very valuable asset to extremists such as Tom Mann, C.T. Cramp, John Hill and W. Straker, who are associated with the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee.     They have issued a circular to all Trade Union Branches and Trade Councils, urging them to pass and transmit to the Polish Legation and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress a resolution protesting against Poland&apos;s&quot;wanton attack&quot; on Russia, and threatening a national strike. Great play is being made with an alleged air offensive on Kieff on   April 19th and talk of the murder of women and children by the Polish capitalists under the influence of the rulers of Paris and London.The extremists are much elated with the episode of the&quot;Jolly George&quot;, which the dockers refuse to load with munitions, and they hope that this action will form a precedent,    They appear to suspect the loading of the s.s. &quot;Xenia&quot; at the Royal Arsenal jetty, and disbelieve the official statement that the cargo is destined for Australia.   At the Triennial Conference of the Dockers&apos; Union on May 18th the workers were called upon to withhold their labour if ordered, toassist any form of intervention in Russia.   A manifesto on the same subject has been issued by the more moderate leaders, in which they deplore what they call &quot;an attack upon the rights of Governments of working class origin&quot; and assert that the temper of the Labour movement is rapidly rising.    My correspondents think, however, that most of the agitation will end in talkfor there is no real support for the cause of the Russian Soviets among the working classes.    One of them, John Clarke, uses the pages of &quot;The Worker&quot; to taunt the working classes on their love of &quot;freedom&quot; and says that Russia is athirst for engineers, railwaymen, moulders,.joiners, shipwrights, smiths and builders.    &quot;If you are FREE why not make a move to another country/
country; wfrerer wh&amp;t^er^sl:ill^ andnobly appreciated,...... &quot;Are you free enough to move from britain to Muscovy? Show us your freedom!&quot;The British.Labour Rogation arrived in Russia almost on the samo day as the Russian Co-operative delegates arrived in London.   So far, reports from Russia seem to show that our Labour men are being effectively duped by their hosts,   Neverthe less, the extremists here are sceptical about tha &quot;Delegation and refer in uncomplimentary terms to Trade Union loaders and &quot;simpering females like Ethel Snowden&quot;.Two Englishmen who were in Moscon? at the time of Mr, Lansbury&apos;s visit have challenged lansbury to engage in a public debate.   He has not definitely refused the challenge but insists won having a share in formulating the terms.  -THE CO-CB-BRAT H^MOVEIMTIt.is protable that the 52nd Annual Conference of the Co-operative Society, to be held at Bristol from May 24th to May   S 26th, will decide whether it will combine with Labour or will remain independent.   It will be remembered that in 1917 the Congress at Swansea decided that it should become a definite and independent political Party aiming at - the establishment of a Co-operative Commonwealth.   In the following year, at Liverpool, it was decided to secure direct representation in Parliament and in Local Government.   Last year the Carlisle Congress went furthe and instructed its&quot;Representation Committee to take steps to federate with the Labour Party and the Trade Union Congress, with the ultimate object of forming a United Democratic or People&apos;s ; Party.The resolution that will be put at Bristol would establish an alliance between the Co-operatives, the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress under a Join Committee of nine members&quot;, &quot;three from .each body.
It will, however, not all be plain sailing, for the rank and file of Co-operators cling to their dividends, and distrust political Labour and all its works,   If, they say, the Co-operators cannot construct a political system of their om they are not likely to profit by such an alliance.THE HOUSING question there is a further wave of unrest about the shortage of houses and the proposal to raise rents.   New impetus has been given to the demand for the erection of houses by direct labour.LABOUR COLLEGES AND SCHOOLSFrom the report of the First Annual Conference of the Proletarian Schools held in Glasgow, it seems this movement has made some progress since its inauguration in 1918.   There are now twenty-six branches, mostly in Scotland, and the finances are just solvent.   The organiser is.Tom Anderson, founder of the Proletarian College in Glasgow, and the members of the Bxeoutive are all members of the,Socialist Labour Party.   The movement is to be affiliated to the Third International and its objects are &quot;to teach the children of the working class the absolute necessity for tho abolition of the present political ,   State and the inauguration of the Socialist Industrial Republic, through the Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot;.The organ of the movement is VThe Red Dawn&quot;.While the Central Labour College in London and Ruskin College at Oxford are concerned with&apos; the* instruction of adults, the Proletarian Schools devote themselves to children and are setting out &quot;Ten Proletarian Maxims.&quot;THE SHOP STEWARD movement the Scottish Shop stewards  Committees have appealed to the Executive of the Third International for a loan of  1,000for/
for Press purposes, particularly an &quot;extension of &quot;The Worker&quot;.I .  They allege that the National Labour Press threatens to create a Labour Press monopoly which might suppress the Communist * papers.The British National Council of Shop Stewards has&apos;supplied! to Jack Tanner credentials addressed to Litvinoff in,Copenhagen! Jack Tanner left this country without a passport as a seaman and deserted in Scandinavia.   He may be prosecuted for desertiol on his return to this country.THE COMMUNIST PARTY II&apos; ; The National Executive Committee of the Socialist Labour jParty, which has recently been described by John S. Clarke as j a &quot;hotbed of self righteous cant and nauseating hypocrisy&quot;, has issued a manifesto on the reoent negotiations for a communist Party.The Executive declares that it cannot proceed with *frnity negotiations on the lines hitherto adopted and will only recognise representation on this question&quot;&apos;along clear and       j distinct revolutionary lines wherein the Proletarian  * Revolution-stands clear and clean from comnromise.   . ITHE.POSTAL WORKERS IThe first annual conference of the Union of Post Office i Workers was held at Morecambe on May llth-15th. Over eight I hundred delegates, representing some 100,000 members, were j present and 845 resolutions had been submitted for consideration , The outstanding questions before the conference related I to wages and the strike policy. In regard to the first, the j Government offer was accepted and it was decided, by an joverwhelming majority of delegates, to adopt a strike policy j -  or to institute a strike fund by contributing 6d. per week.    I The members will now be balloted to make this, decision binding^&apos;The/  I
The national, programme-adopted^by-the-conference-c-overs joint management of the Post Office by the staff in conjunction, with the State, full civil rights for postal servants, equal pay for equal work, a working week of 38^ hours in five days, including meal times, and increased holidays and pensions.ftEWCASTLE-ON-TYNBMy correspondent reports that unemployment is decreasing in this area, but that the cost of living is causing great discontent.   There is a feeling, amongst the general public, as well as in Labour circles, that Russia should be left alone to work out her destiny.The out-door campaign has started on the Tyneside and the audiences are fairly good.   Mb. C. P. Trevelyan and Councillor D. Adams, the prospective Labour candidates, are working very hard in their constituencies.   Father 0TDonnell, the Australian chaplain, has also been speaking.My correspondent sends the following report on feeling in-  the various industries :-Agriculture: The workers are.jealous of the railwayporters&apos; wages and demand a minimum of  3 per week,aaginoorlng: The men think that they are entitled to afurther increase in wages and that the 44 hour week is overdue.   The time workers are putting very little energy into their tasks and the view that there will be a slump in the industry is gaining ground.Mining: General, sacisfaction with the last wagesaward is expressed, hut the increase in the price of coal has aroused much resentment.   The secretary, of the Durham Miners&apos; Association considers that wages have now reached a &quot;normal&quot; figure and that the lodges Will in future concen-trate on a reduction in the cost of living.Shipbuilding: The men think that the  hipping boom isnearing an end and there are indications of a &apos;cal canny&apos; policy.   This is particularly marked in the case of the S.S. &quot;Aquitania&quot; which is being refitted.Building: The demand for workers in this industry is so great that the men are quite independent.&apos;        &apos; THE/
THE POLICE STRIKERSThe re-instatement by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway of the railway police has.raised the hopes of the London and Liverpool strikers, who think that they are nearing success.   The Trafalgar Square demonstration on May 16th was attended, however, &quot;by a few hundred people only.Some discontent is said to have existed amongst the Liverpool police, but my correspondent finds that the men are contented, apart from high prices, but say that these are due to the continual strikes of Labour.FEELING AMONG EX-SERVICE MEMDetails of the Congress of Ex-Service Men at Geneva have not yet been received, but it is known that on the whole the result was disappointing.   Henri Barbusse presided and delegates were present from England, Prance, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and Alsace; the Austrian and the Russian delegates were not allowed to cross the Swiss frontier. Decisions were t**ken to press for the abolition of armaments and secret diplomacy and for an international general strike on mobilisation being declared in any country.   There were grave differences when the Italians proposed to affiliate with the Third International; the British, German and some of the French delegates were in strong opposition, snd it was agreed that each national organisation should do as it wished, It was resolved that all future conferences and correspondence should be conducted in Esperanto.The only British organisation represented was the Nation Union of Ex-Service Men, and the International Union professe; to find the results of the Congress disappointing.An increasing number of propagandists appear to be at work among serving soldiers, chiefly in restaurants, confectionery shops and kinematograph theatres, for soldiers do not appear to attend meetings in the parks in London.HAROLD/
HAROLD BURGESSOn May 14th Harold Burgess, manager of &quot;The Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;, was arrested and charged xuider Regulation 42 of the Defence of the Realm Act for attempting to cause disaffection amongst the Irish Guards at Caterham.   Ee supplied certain Guards-men with copies of the pamphlet &quot;Soviets for the British&quot; for distribution amongst their comrades and gave them money.   The case has been adjourned for a week, hail being refused.Miss Sylvia Pankhurst is much perturbed by the arrest, probably fearing that she will be incriminated.S. A. HANSONOn May 12th, P. R. Lark, who stabbed Hanson with an ice - pick at Hammersmith recently, was sentenced to one months imprisonment in the second division.   There is much comment on the sentence in extremist circles, where it. is compared with &apos;:     the punishment of agitators who &quot;tell, the truth&quot;.THE BRITISH SOCIALIST PARTYThe granting of passports to the Labour Delegation to Russia emboldened the British Socialist Party to agitate for passports on its own account for Messrs. William MoLaine and Tom Quelch. The expenses for the trip are being paid by Theodore^. Rothstein who has given Albert Inkpin  300 for that purpose.   Quelch ^admitted in conversation that his Party: would have been practically non-existent during the last few months if it had not been for the Russian Bolshevik money disbursed by Rothstein.   Re said that the trip to Russia would greatly improve the international position of the Party.Meanwhile an aeroplane travelling from Germany to   Russia made a forced landing in Latvia on the 6th April. , The passengers burned their mail bags but failed to make away with some of their papers.   One of them, named Rosenberger, carried a pass, issued on/
Yon the 11th March, for Moscow on behalf of&quot;^heA)ermaJi..Poreign. Office.   Among the papers were letters signod by Miss Sylvia Pankhurst and James Gordon and addressed to Lenin in terms of extravagant eulogy.   These papers show that considerable sums of money have been supplied by the Soviet Government for propaganda in Western Europe, and in one it is suggested that funds for Prance should be sent in the form of large pearls and f*r England, sapphires.SINK FEIN III GREAT britain during the week there have been the usual Sinn Fein meetings in London, but ntthing of special importance has ooourred.   Mrs. Sheeny Skeffington has addressed a Woolwich meeting of 800 and a gathering of the Fellowship of Reconcilia-tion.   Her speeches are always venomous, and on the last named occasion she stated that last week British troops in Ireland had used liquid fire.   She added that she favoured a Soviet, but not a capitalist, republic.It is claimed in Irish circles that the release of the hunger strikers from Wormwood Scrubs is a victory for the Irish Self-Determination League.   Much bitterness is expressed against the lack of support from British Labour.It has been decided to hold open air Sinn Fein meetings in Ltndon during the summer, if possible daily.Several Irishmen in London have been heard to deplore the recent outrages in Ireland.Details are now available of the position in Liverpool during the recent dockers1 strike, which has proved a severe check to the local Irish extremists.   Councillor Kelly, the leader of the local movement, in the first instance approached the Unions for support and was refused, it being noteworthy that five of his eight supposed supporters voted against him. What really appears to have happened is that Xelly seized the opportunity to try and cause friction between the unions and the men who failed him, with the object of getting them discharged from/
-9- &quot; 110from their position as delegates, and procuring the re-election of more advanced men.   On examining the position of the men who did strike it is clear that apart from Irish Steamship Companies&apos; ships the only men who acted in a body were those belonging to the branches of the Dockers to which these offending delogatos were attached, and it is firmly believed in Trade Union official circles that the strike was more against individuals whom it was hoped to replace than in support of &quot;hunger-strikers&quot;.The Liverpool Trades&apos; Council had given the Irish Labour Party a half promise that another general strike in Ireland would see the Liverpool mon officially handing in notices on the same day.   The Unions now consider that the Irish have deliberately attacked them, and this promise has definitely been withdrawn so that the possibility of Liverpool supporting an Irish strike seems very remote.The feeling among non-Irish men in the port is raised to fever heat and there has been considerable difficulty in avoiding a clash.   Irish placards regarding the strike, in every case where they had not been pulled down, were covered with obscene abuse and remarks about Ireland.Discharged service men made use of dock stencils and marked a whitewashed wall, too high to be rubbed out, with &quot;Strike and lose your pay,for the Irish.   They won the War&quot;   and &quot;Another injustice to Ireland - Conscription they didn&apos;t get.&quot;The lack of Sinn Fein organisation in Liverpool is shown by the clear fact that the leaders made practically no use of the olubs (which have no real idea now of what actually happened) but relied on general appeals to the crowdy/ds on the &apos;standsT.A prominent Labour man, a foreman coal heaver, working in the middle of the worst class of Irish, asked his opinion of the Irish organisation stated: &quot;It isn&apos;t Irish organisations that need worry anybody, it&apos;s the Irish roughs tha,t&apos;s the trouble here, they want the chance to make a row and pinch something.&quot;The Trade Unions locally have decided to take no further notice/
notice of the &quot;Arms to Ireland&quot; complaints.   A foreman stevedore said: &quot;If they try to send arms or stores by the Irish Companies&apos; &quot;boats they will get trouble as they are manned by Irish, but if they send arms, etc, by tramp ships from our end of the North docks we111 ship all that&apos;s wanted to blow hell out of the lot of them.&quot;On April 15th some 5,000 people attended an anti-Sinn Fein demonstration in Sheil Perk, Liverpool, organised by the Loyal British Patriotic Labour Party.   The chairman on the chief plat-form was Mr. Richard Briggs, D.I-I.G., of the Grand Black Chapter of Ireland and tho demonstration, which was the first real attempt to combat Sinn Fein-Bolshevik propaganda, was a great success.   Some three hundred Sinn Feiners attended to heckle, but they were compelled to remove their hats during the singing of the National Anthem and cheers for the Prince of Wales, A resolution was passed protesting against the Bolshevik and Sinn Fein propaganda which is being rampantly promulgated in this and other parts of the country, with the object of undermining the security of the Throne and Constitution and regretting that the Labour Party should lend its support to an organisation which has not only been instrumental in illegally proclaiming an Irish Republic but encourages lawlessness, involving crime and disorder, and the brutal murder of Police and Soldiers and law-abiding persons in Ireland.   The resolution further declared that the meeting supported the Government in its determination to secure freedom for British citizens and protection from outrages in Ireland and pledged itself to render all possible assistance to the Protestants of Ireland in their demand to remain under the protection of the King and the Constitution.On May 9th a Sinn Fein Labour demonstration was held at Old Trafford.   The audience oonsisted chiefly of Irish men and women but there was considerable disturbance and a tendency to fight amongst the Irish themselves and between the unsympathetic Britishers and Irishmen.   The speakers included Hr. Tom Myers,M.P.Father/
Father 0&apos;Donnell was the chief speaker at a Newcastle meeting of some 2,000 people on May 16th.   He also spoke during the week at Huddersfield and Keighley.   At Huddersfield the Irishmen had been refused by the usual halls, but managed to book the Drill Kail, which is Government property.A number of Sinn Feiners were seen drilling in the public park at Bothwell, Glasgow, last week.   They appeared to be miners.   It is believed that the smuggling of explosives and small arms is going on but the quantity is very small.   The Sinn Fein leaders in Glasgow are complaining of a leakage of informatioIRELANDThere was no improvement in the state of the Provinces during the past week, large tracts of the country being practically in a state of anarchy.The total number of reported outrages for the week is approximately 250 of which 68 are cases of burning vacated Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks and 36 cases of raiding and destroying the contents of Income Tax offices in pursuance of the Sinn Pein campaign of destruction commenced last Easter.   These figures, however, by no means represent the true state of affairs, very many persons preferring to suffer in silence rather than expose themselves to further outrage by making any complaint.   There . were eleven oases of murder during the week, seven of the victims being members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, as well as a number of other cases in which police were fired at end escsped or only received slight wounds.Two police huts in Tipperary, South Riding, were attacked but successfully defended, though in one instance the main hut was demolished by fire, the police maintaining a spirited defence of the small outbuildings until the attacking party with-drew.A brutal murder, due to agrarian motives, occurred in County Meath, a farmer&apos;s son being killed while ploughing.Every/
Every effort is being made by Sinn Fein to break down the discipline and morale of the Royal Irish Constabulary.   In many places the police are boycotted and experience the greatest difficulty in obtaining the ordinary necessaries of life, being forced to commandeer and cook their own food; in few places daro anyone hold conversation with them.   Pressure is now being brought to bear to make men resign by threatening their parents and rolatives at home.There is no change apparent in the plans of Sinn Fein which consist in carrying on what really amounts to a species of guerill warfare against the government of this country.   Without greatly increased military assistance it is questionable how much longer t Royal Irish Constabulary can support the burden which they have borne unaided so long.There is no change in the Labour situation.   A Labour Day meeting was held in Wexford town on Sunday 9th, and a fairly large crowd was addressed by local speakers who used no inflammatory language.   The object of the meeting was principally to organise labour for the coming elections.   Mr. Lorrimer, member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, London, did not attend as annouiiThere was increased activity and daring in the Dublin Metropolitan Police area during the week.   Three unoccupied Dublin Metropolitan Police Barracks on the outskirts of the City, viz., Besboro1, Crumlin and Kill-0&apos;-Grange were simultaneously set on, fire on the night of 12th instant between 10 and 11 o!clock.   The last named was completely destroyed, but the others were only slightly injured, and the fire in Besboro&apos; was extinguished by the Police.   Telephone wires were cut and the roads blocked by aimed men, while petrol was being thrown on the buildings.There is some indication that the more respectable Sinn Fein are alarmed at the campaign of assassination and might be willing to denounce the murderers - they do not see a way of doing this at present without giving themselves away and drawing reprisals on themselves.
