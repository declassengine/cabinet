-.N/N\       This Document is thg Property of;HiSBHtanmc Mai sty^s Government.3Military Secret. 1377-From Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Foreign Department,nth May mo.1714. Your telegram 332 S., dated 23rd March. I have given your proposals very careful consideration. 1 appreciate your desire for pacification of Waziristan, and I recognise the right of the population of our border districts to a greater measure of protection than they have yet received. 1 agree with your conclusions that these objects can best be attained by occupying the country, whilst the motor roads enumerated in para. 5 of your telegram are being constructed, the constabulary formed, the tribes disarmed and their forts destroyed, all of which will take time. I feel some doubt as to whether a really permanent occupation will not bind you to a permanent increase in your forces, and tie up an undesirably large force in this country in the event of hostilities with Afghanistan or elsewhere, whilst the direct administration of the country, however loose at the start, will involve you in increasing responsibilities as time goes on. So that eventually a reconsideration of the policy may be forced on you as it has been in the past.While, therefore, I sanction the military measures to give effect to the Makin scheme on the lines proposed, and agree that the necessary garrison must be adequately housed and provided for with least delay, it seems advisable to concentrate on the road-making part of your scheme, and to defer permanent buildings and accommodation as far as possible. We can discuss at a later date what is to happen after the roads are completed.fx,    /
