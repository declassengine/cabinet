The Cabinet.1 369     )&apos; I      Resumption of Trade with Russia,,^Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,01491 must draw the attention of the Cabinet to paragraph (1) of C.P. 1349 - Note Summarising the Conclusions of the Inter-Departmental Russian Trade Committee on the Chief Obstacles to&apos; the Resumption of Trade with Russia.&quot;The difficulties arising from the deposit of gold in this country might, however, be evaded by its location in a neutral State, and the agreement made by Krassin and Ahrahamson has this end in view,&quot;Here is a perfectly unblushing proposal by aCommittee of British Government officials to enter into collusionwith the Bolsheviks   in order to &quot;evade&quot; the action of theCourts in this country and deny to British subjects who havebeen robbed by the Bolsheviks their ordinary remedies at law.Surely this aspect should receive the attention ofcthe Law Officers of the Crown and of the Lord Chancellor.   It would certainly seem to afford material for moat damaging criticism in Parliament should it become public.(2)      In the Appendix *A! to CP. 1342 (Trade with Russia), paragraph (1), it is stated &quot;The buyers are to be in every case the Russian co-operative Sooiety, but the sellers can be any approved firm in the United Kingdom,&quot;  We now know that the leaders of the Russian co-operative Societies with whom we were formerly in touch have been ejeoted, and that these organisations have been definitely taken over by the state, Mr, Berkenheim and the other original co-operators are to be proscribed, and should they fall into the Soviet power they are to be tried for &quot;attempting to subvert the communistic State by economic means/1(intd,)   W.S.C,Dhe War Office, 29th Hay, 1920,
