C03^ ^0.CAB DOT.I 0; P.  1342.TRADE with RUSSIA.vtote by the Board of Trade on the principles which should fjuide the British representative?? who take part in any discussions with the Russian (Soviet) delegates on resumption of trade &quot;&apos;ith Russia.is(l)      The British Delegates should &quot;firmly refuse to be drawn into any discussions as to the respective merits of Individualism and Communisn as the economic basis of society, as such discussions are bound to be pterile and will only prolong and probably envenom the negotiations.(2)      &quot;while, however, the British Delegates should refrain from any attempt to convert the Russian Delegates to their o^rn point of view in this matter, they should insist that the settlement of claims and ob-li^ations as between Governments or private citizens of the t^o countdee must necessarily be based on thrt principle universally accepted by all the parties concerned at the tine when the obligations were entered into The substitution of a oorriunistic for an individualistic Society in Russia does not wipe out all the responsibility of the Russian Govern-nent towards private fomisn citizens ^ho invested capital in Russia before the change in the reasonable expectation that their property rights would continue to be respected.   , It should be pointed out that unless this expectation is fulfilled, it is hopeless to expect private foreigners to invest capital in Russia, or to take any steps towards resuming trade which nay expose their qqo&amp;b or other property to ,the danger of confiscation by the Authorities of a country which decline to be bound by the ordinary rules of civilised Governments.   It should, *here for.6. ^e explained clearly.to the Russian Delegates that if it is desired that Hie I&amp;ileBty-s Government should do more than remove the positive obstacles .to ;trade with Russia which r..ri$** out of export restrictions and naval search, jit is necessary.to cone to a preliminary1 understanding as to the recognition.by.the Soviet Government of
1 h Q I &apos;i 0- 2 -Russian pro-revolution obligations zo British subjects;    for., since the British Government does not, like the Soviet Government, itself engage in ordinary trade operations, it is necessary in order to establish a flow of trade to restore the confidence of the private trading community, and. to overcome their reluctance to have any com-nercial or financial relations with a Government in which at present they feel no trust.   If the Russian Delegates decline to accept this point of view,, the British Delegates should state that,, under these conditions, they are not authorised to discuss anything beyond the removal of positive obstructions to tra^e, and it might be well for them&apos; to add a warning that they have no belief that anything substan-tial will result from this removal unless it is accompanied by the necessary measures to restore confidence in Russia. (3)       If, on the other hand, the Russian Delegates declare their willingness as part of a general settlement to discuss the quest ion of foreign claims, a sub-committee, including technical exports should be set up for the purpose of discussing the natter in detail, end the Russian Delegates should be told, that the satisfactory settlement of other matters discussed with them is contingent on a solution of this preliminary question.     Before going into details in this fcaportant matter with the Russians, the British Delegates should make sure that their Allied colleagues are in general accord with them in matters of principle.     The principles which in the opinion of the Board of Trade should govern the settlement of the question of claims, debts and obligations are as follows :-(a) Ho property of a British subject in Russia should be nationalised unless similar property of Russian citizens and all other foreigners is also nationalised at the same time.   If in any case such differentiation has already taken place, the property in Question should be restored to the former owner in kind, unless circumstances make this impossible.(b) In the event of any property formerly owned by a British subject in Russia but now nationalised being de-nationalised in future, the former owner should, have the option to resume possession on surrendering the bonds credited, to him by way of compensation under paragraph ( c.) subject to any necessary adjustments in case of depreciation
4 ,1 1*or appreciation of the value of the property in the meantime, owing to the act or neglect of the Russian authorities.(o)       Subject to the foregoing stipulations, no clain should ho pressed for the restoration in kind of British property nationalised by the &quot;de facto&quot; Government of Russia, but compensation for his loss should be paid to the former British own^r in the shape of bonds ranking nari passu with the Russian pre-war debt to an amount to be fixed by an impartial tribunal.(d) .    Similar principles of compensation apply (nutatis mutandis) to shares or other interest owned by a British subjeot in a Company whose property in Russia has been nationalised and also to the oase of losses incurred by British creditors whose Russian debtors have been rendered incapable of discharging their debts by the nationalisatioh of their property.(e) The Russian external debt owing to British and other allied subjeots and citizens up to the time of the Revolution should be recognised. Unless this matter is previously settled, it seems impracticable to arrange for compensation by means of bonds to- the dispossessed British owner of nationalised property!; inasmuch as it would be inequitable to allow compensation bonds to rank ahead of the existing Russian debt.(An effort should also be made to seoure recogni-tion of internal Russian debts subscribed to by British and other allied subjeots and citizens.)(f) For the purpose of the foregoing paragraphs companies registered in Russia in whioh Allied shareholders had before the revolution a pre-ponderant interest shall be assimilated to Allied subjeots and citizens.The British delegates should endeavour to obtain the assent of their Allied Colleagues to these principle^ and intase of substantial difference., they should report to his majesty s Government and obtain further instructions.(4)      There are indications that M. Krassin may press thatall private British claims should be taken over by theBritish Government and put forward as a single Governmentn ^ see Agreement between Krassin and Abrahanson). The British Delegates should scrutinise carefully any proposal of this kind if put forward.
If the intention be merely to save time by consolidating the claims,and to secure a preliminary examination of them before they are presented, the proposal is acceptable, but if, as seems moreI irobable, it is an attempt to compel us to &quot;nationalise&quot; ourprivate claims so that they may be dealt with on the same footing as obligations between the two Governments, it may be highly dangerous, as we know the Soviet Government comtemplates settingoff against any Allied Government claims, claims against those governments in respect of alleged injury through military inter-vontion in Russia in support of Koltchak and Dcnikcn, etc..be decidedWhatever policy may ultimately/upon as.regards the British Government&apos;o war loan to Russia, it is clearly&apos; lnadmissable that any claims should bo allowed to be set against the Russian obligations public and private to- private Eritish subjects except the corresponding British obligations, if any, to private Russian citizens.(&amp;)      In the course of discussion, a suggestion may be put forward by the Russian Delegates that payment for railway material for the rehabilitation of Russian transport should be secured by a first charge oh the revenues of these railways.&apos; Though this is in itself a reasonable proposal in accord wi$n the usual railway procedure in similar circumstances, the British Delegates should point out that, without the consent of the former owners of the railways, such a charge would probably not be recognised as good security, and that the consent o  these former owners could not properly be pressed for unless at the same time, there is a settlement of the question of compensation to foreign holders of Russian railway stock for their compulsory expropriation.    This is another argument for settling the question of recognition of claims concurrently with that of the resumption of tradei
&apos;   M9(8)     The Russian Delegates are likely to raise the question of the legal protection of any gold, securities, or other property which the Soviet Government may deposit in London as .security for credits, against legal action on the part of creditors.    The British Delegates should tako the line that the.best possible mode of protection would be for the Soviet Government to acknowledge its responsibilities towards foreign creditors and to arrive at an equitable agreement as to the basis of compensation.    If this-be done the question of legal security for gold etc. would no longer be formidable.    Apart, however, from suc^ recognition, it in impossible to give a guarantee against legal action as it would be practically impossible to pass legislation for .the purpose unless proper recognition had already ,been accorded to foreign claims.    It may be added, however, that it is improbable, that any such legal action would in fact succeed unless the actual property in question were clearly identifiable as belonging to the claimant under Russian law.(7) Certain other questions, in addition to that of legal security, will arise in connection with any gold imported into this country on behalf of the Soviet Government.    The request will probably be made that a general licence for re-export should be granted prior to importation covering the whole amount to be imported.    It is understood that the Treasury would ordinarily object to the grant of such a license, and no undertaking should be given to the Soviet Delegates.without consultation of the Treasury.If the question arises of purchase of the gold by His Majesty1s government the point must be borne in mind that there are now two prices for gold - the internal gold price and that of gold for export - with a wide margin between them.    On this
&apos;   ISO*question also it will be necessary to consult the Treasury before any language is used which might commit His Majesty&apos;s Government.(8)      Reference will probably be made during the discussion to an agreement between M. Krassin and Sir Martin Abrahamson, purporting to establish a sort of Credits Clearing House at Copenhagen to finance trade between Russia and other countries on the basis of the deposit of gold up to twenty five per cent of the total credits to be given.   In so far as the promoters of this scheme do not ask for Government assistance, there is no need for the British Delegates to offer any criticism, but If their opinion should be asked as to the feasibility of the scheme, they should say that according to their information, there is not in existing circumstances any ,-chancellor.e of Allied financial houses subscribing to Or taking part in any such scheme, nor would His Majesty s Government bo prepared to use Government credit for the purpose.   The British Delegates may put forward an alternative method of financing Russian trade indicated in the attached scheme marked (A) which is a slight modification   - . of the existing Exports Credit Scheme of the Board of Trade to adapt it to the- special circumstances of Russia.    (It should, however, be borne in mind that this is essentially a British Government scheme, and does not lend itself to conversion into an inter-Allied proposition.)(9)      Another scheme which is worth exploring is the establish-ment of a depot either at some intermediate port, e.g. Reval, or possibly in a free zone to be created under suitable safeguards in the port of Petrograd itself.   Goods exported from the Allied countries would remain Allied property within such depot, and would not be released therefrpm until Russian exports to an
equivalent value luad eotually arrived in trio dwpot la payment for those roods.   Under such an arrangement, if praotinobl     *.comparatively small deposit of gold should be sufficient toenable trade to be started and. continued, provided that Russianjroods are available in appreciable quantities for export.   If,however, the Russian goods are not forthcoming, the amount ofthe transactions possible under this (or any other) scheme is bound to be limited by the amount of gold or other tangibleassets deposited as security.(10)     As regards the removal of positive impediments to trade(popularly termed the &quot;Blockade5&apos;), the attitude of the british representatives should be that indicated in the following press notice prepared by the Board of Trade, but not yet published.&quot;The Board of Trade announce that there is no legal obstacle to prevent British subjects from entering into commercial and financial transactions with persons in Russia, and that no export licences are required for the present for the export to Russia of any goods in List C of prohibited eyrtr^ruit/(i.e. for any goods for which export licences are not &apos; r required for all foreign destinations).It should be understood that traders must make their own arrangements, and that they undertake transactions entirely at their own risk.The passage of shigs and cargoes&apos; to Russia Is not at present interfered with provided that arms and munitions are not carried, subject, however, in the case of the Black Sea, to the discretion of the Naval Authorities.&quot;(11)     As regards shipping, the British representatives shouldtake the line that the resumption of trade with Russia necessarilyimplies freedom of shipping, Allied, Neutral and Russian, to plywithout molestation between Allied and Russian ports.   Theactual landing, of Russian crews on Allied soil would probably haveto be subject to some kind of supervision in order to excludepropaganda of an undesirable kind, and this point should be reserved for further consideration.   In,order to induce british ship-owners to trust ships in Bolshevik ports, it would, benecessary to obtain some assurance from the Russian Delegates that
1 r ^ 1J6Board of Trade,May 26th, 1920.Allied ships and crews in Russian ports should not be molested or interfered with in any way and should enjoy the same treatment as is accorded by the well established practice of maritime nations to ships and citizens of a friendly nation visiting their ports.   The details of this assurance will need craeful con-sideration in consultation with Shipping Experts at a later stage of the discussions.(12)     It will be necessary to arrive at an understanding as to the treatment to be applied in Russia to industrial artistic and literary property owned or controlled by British and allied nationals.   The details of any such understanding will need very careful consideration by experts.   The board of Trade have-at present insufficient information as to the present position of this class of property In Soviet Russia to enable them to draft detail instructions at the present stage.
a r qt 1 J jAMFX &quot;A&quot; TO BOARD OF TRADF NOTE ON PFSU^PTIOY OF TRADE,WITH RUSSIA.X outline Heads cf Scheme for adapting the. Board of Trade exports credit Scheme to the special condi-ticns of Trade with Russian Co-operative Societies.1.        The Buyers arc to be in every case the Russian Co-operative Societies, but the Sellers can be any approved firm in the United Kingdom.2.        The exported goods are to be delivered to the Co-operative Societies&apos; at a Russian or near-by port, but only in exchange for goods.3..        SO as to induce British Sellers to take this risk, the British Government vail insure the shipper against the risks in Russian ports to goods shipped to Russia or to goods intended for exchange.   It will also insure him against his loss if it be necessary to re-ship goods to this country owing to failure on the part of the Buyers to take, up such goods, provided that a reasonable time limit be imposed.4.        A Shipper can they be insured up to Qo% of his &quot;cost&quot; under the ordinary regulations of the jpeports Credit Scheme up to a total amount not exceeding the proportion of the  26,000,000 which would normally be allocated to Russia.^  Note:-      This scheme has not so far been discussed withthe Treasury.
