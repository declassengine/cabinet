CABINET.KMJONTROL Of IflLAND DISTRIBUTION CP COAL. LOCOMOTIVE SUPPIiKS 3P20K SOUTH WA1KS.JOINT MJtMOiUNDUM BY THT! MINI 8KB OF TRANSPORT AND THI&apos;OP THE BOARD OP TRADEiThe polidy of the Government has been to ensure supplies of ooal for home requirements and to this end exports have been, during the last few months, considerably curtailed.    This has involved diverting ooal inland from South Wales and the North-Bast Coast of England, the natural outlet for which was shipment.It has only been possible to secure this ooal for inland purposes by tho rail &quot;ways organising a special movement of the ooal, and the railways themselves being large consumers hara taken this coal for their own use.    As a result they have been enabled to. restore their stocks to a safe figure.    The railways cannot, generally speaking, increase their stocks further.In order to ensure the success of de-control of distribu-tion, it is suggested by the Coal Controller that the Railway Companies should continue as a matter of routine to receive coal for current rail my purposes from South Wales and, if necessary, from North umber land and Durham.    The continuance of this special movement of coal entails a heavy strain on railway resources, and to a certain extent interferes with ordinary traffic.This will have the effect of releasing for ordinary Industrial, public utility and household purposes similar quantities of ooal which the railways are at present drawing/from
9 r 61 J)        from the Midland areas.    The quantity of ooal so released will be, in the ease of ooal supplied from South Wales alone, some 60,000 tons per week.     The release of this quantity ia the Midlands - the areas in vhich supplies for industrial and house-hold purposes are shortest - will give considerable relief.5. The taking of railway coal from South Wales and, if necessary,from Northumberland and Durham in this way will, apart from objections as regards suitability of the coal, throw upon the Railway Companies a heavy inoreased financial burden.     This increased burden is due to the fact that by the arrangements suggested they will be compelled to purchase a higher priced coal and to haul it for much longer distances.     !Ehe increased burden is estimated by tho Ministry of Transport at  2,000,000 per ariirumf6, Tho Minister of Transport is of opinion that this burdenoannot be accepted by the Hallways nor be thrown by the Railways on to the public     In these circumstances it would have, in the ordinary course, to be met by tie. Government which has guaranteed the Railway dividends.7. In view, however, of the fact thefc this re-arrangement isnot for the convenience of the Railways but to ensure publio coal supplies in the Midland area, the Minister of Transport and the president of the Board of 0?rade consider that the increased cost should be met out of the pool resulting from,the financial arrangements made between the Coal Mines Department and the Coal Owners,&apos;8, 3?he Minister of Transport and the president of the Board ofTrade accordingly submit that this oourse be approved. &apos;R,S,H0M.28th May, 1920.
