4uThis Document in the Property ofFrom Viceroy, 2hi May 1020. (Received 22nd May. 11.30 a.m.)639 S. Secret. Negotiations with Bolshevik Government. Reference para. 1 of telegram D.1J. 333 of 14th May from intelligence Bureau, London, to Intelligence Bureau, Simla, and reference to the same subject in Cox&apos;s telegrams 260 of 9tli May and 261 of 10th May. We have received no information from you that negotiations are actually proceeding or are about to take place with Soviet Government; but if this is true we suggest, for consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government, desirability of coming to an arrangement with Bolsheviks regarding Afghanistan. We appreciate the fact that it is not desirable to give Bolsheviks impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government attaches undue importance to Afghanistan, but in view of recent informa-tion from an absolutely reliable source that Bolshevik Government have authorised Suritz to renew the negotiations at Kabul, and to secure an agreement with Afghanistan on the basis of hostility to Great Britain, it might be well to forestall such an agreement by an agreement of our own. If the suggestion is approved, we should be prepared to make proposals in detail as to lines on which an agreement with Soviet Government on the subject of Afghanistan, might be concluded.
