THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OE irI3 ERITASfflC MAJESTY&apos;5 GO^TOMTj.8 SCRjT, 1 - COPY 110.v CABIH1T.C. P. 134.8.HOUSING AND LABOUR. Memorandum by Sir Laming ^orthine-ton-Evans. (Previous Paper CP. 1330).Two meetings of the Cabinet Committee set up in accordance -*&apos;ith Conclusion (7J of Cabinet 2? (20) to review the building programme included in the Estimates of the Office of Works on behalf ef various Government Departments, have been held.   So far as these investigations have proceeded, it has been found possible in many cases to postpone building operations, at considerable in-convenienoe to the Departments concerned, for a period of six months. It has, however, become clear to me that the number of workmen temporarily released for work elsewhere by these postponements will be extremely small, e,g, by the postponement of work on four Post Office buildings, for which a total cum of  367.-245 *as allowed in the Estimates, only 74 bricklayers and 36 carpenters and joiners will become available elsewhere.   Even if all the postponements considered feasible we^e to be made., the skilled labour thereby released would go a negligible distance towards making up the shortage which is so seriously retarding the Ministry of Health&apos;0 Housing Scheme.In these circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that tho &apos; only solution of the problem presented by the shortage of skilled labour in the building trade is the adoption of the system cf &quot;dilution&quot;.   It was stated to the Committee on behalf of the Office of V/orks that it would be possible to teach an urskilled labourer a bricklayer1s job in three weeks and there appears to be no shortage of general labour anywhere in the country which oould be adapted to this purpose.   Moreover, it should be borne in mind that the number of un-skilled men employed as such in building is at present limited by the number of skilled bricklayers1, etc available.   The adoption of the principle of &quot;dilution&quot; therefore would not merely increase the number of bricklayers, but would enable a proportionately larger number of unskilled men to obtain unskilled employment.In his Memorandum (CP, 1330) ^he Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that public attention should be called to the fact that the present rise in building prises is rendering the cost of production prohibitive, and that unless the Unions are prepared to accept mass dilution and to remove1 all restrictions on output the Housing Schemes must be abandoned.   I am strongly of the opinion that training on a large scale for ex-service men as bricklayers and carpenters should be organised at&apos;once and that they should 1? 1 employed on work undertaken by the Office of 7orlcs.   Simultaneously efforts should bn made with the Trade Unions concerned to get their co-operation.If the Trade Unions realise that the Government means to train the ex-service men, they may give way;   if they will not give way, then public opinion must be formed by proper statements of the necessity for securing completion of the building programme and for training ox-sorvice men, so as to obtain support for the Government&apos;0 action in case of a strike.initialled)   L. w\-E&apos;.
