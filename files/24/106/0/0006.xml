V^x/,       ft 0l f1 ,306 TeZrmv/m /rm/t t/ic Government of India, Home Department:, to the Secretary of yMIJ Stale for India, dated .1.1 th, May 1020.-,f A!.. 1. G r Coniniittee Report. 1 have considered your telegram of the 6th-:7tli ^&quot;^^itretfliit in lull Council and the following represents our unanimous opinion which we would ask you to place before the Cabinet. We gratefully appreciate your anxiety to make it clear we are acting together and to give no one an excuse for finding divergencies between IIis Majesty&apos;s Government and our Government, but we do not think that this object will be secured-on the contrary, we fear that it will be defeated  by the adoption of the course which you have; indicated as that preferred by Cabinet Committee, according to which announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Government will, be incorporated in our Resolution, and we shall he precluded from stating our own views fully on the subjects covered by announcement. In the first place, the announcement is avowedly a Cabinet decision, and it is not usual to incorporate such an announce-ment in a Government of India Resolution. Secondly, if we omit our views even on points in which they coincide with or are in substantial agreement with the conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, we shall be exposed to the unjust suspicion that our judgment has fallen markedly short of what was deemed proper by His Majesty&apos;s Government that, in fact, we have been overruled. It is needless to dilate on the injurious effects on public interest of such an impression. Even if we attempted to ( add ? ) a summary of our views, the same effect would be produced in a complete (? lesser) degree. We quite realise that there are differences between His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposed announcement and our draft resolution (six corrupt groups ? and we advance the following considerations) in the hope that closer agree-in ent maybe secured. But it is essential to remember that there are no material differences regarding the action to be taken in the case of individual officers or the precautionary measures to be adopted for the future. We consider that the best way for us to mark this substantial agreement is for us to publish our resolution in full with such modifications as are indicated below, and for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s announcement, modified as we hope it may be after their consideration of our views expressed below, to be published simultaneously. The latter will then read as a concurrent judgment conveying a message to the people of India from His Majesty&apos;s Government on points of special importance which they consider it necessary to emphasise. We trust you will not misunderstand our objections to any such incorporation of the announcement in our resolution. Out-general position is this : The disorders of last year were events of the gravest importance. We ourselves with your approval appointed a Committee consisting of persons selected with your assistance on account of their high standing and judicial experience to investigate these events and to report their findings to us. It is now7 our duty to examine these findings and to state our conclusions upon them. We have done so to the best of our ability and with utmost impartiality of which we are Capable, and we consider that our decisions should, now be announced to the people of India (two corrupt groups). We admit that our very closeness to the events, and our intimate acquaintance with their details may have clouded our perspective, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government looking at the whole from, a different standpoint may be impressed by different aspects of the case, and may consider it necessary to state their views on certain matters in different language or with greater emphasis than we have employed. To this, of course, we cannot and do not object. AVe trust for the reasons stated, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will permit us to state our views completely in a self-contained document which carries their general sanction or approval, subject to simultaneous statement of their own. views in a complementary document. The acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of this alternative plan will facilitate publication which, for obvious reasons cannot be longer delayed, as our Resolution is ready, and the announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Government can suitably be published as a separate document with an introduction on the following lines : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government, having considered the  Report  of the&apos; Corn-mi tfcee appointed to enquire into the disorders in India in the spring of last year, and the Resolution of the Government of India thereon, have directed that the following announcement of their views on certain questions (? arising) out of these 1 matters should be made public simultaneously with the Government of India&apos;sIO  1500     100  5.20
pResolution and Report. The Secretary of State for India has accordingly communicated the following statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government fcr publication.&quot;We will now deal first with the modifications you have suggested in our draft independently of the text of His Majesty&apos;s Governments announcement.Your point (1) first: We agree to the addition of a new sub-paragraph at the end of para. 32 as suggested by you, but press for the omission of the last sentence which alludes to General Dyer&apos;s action.Point (1) second : Your suggested addition to para. 36. We do not think that this reference to the Great War is an argument of any weight, but we are ready to include it if you so desire. In any ease we should like to substitute the word &quot; accentuating &quot; for &quot; transcending.&apos;1Point (2). Para. 22. We agree to the addition suggested, but woidd omit the words &quot; on this account &quot; and insert &quot; useful &quot; before &quot; purpose.&quot;Point (3). We have no objection to the insertion of a new paragraph on the subject of the police corruption. We think it should be made perfectly clear, as you. yourself have explained, that the promised investigation does not mean a new general enquiry which would stimulate unrest and feelings of bitterness and defeat the object on which you have laid so much stress, both where you speak of the chapter now being closed, and where you appeal for the obliteration of any trace of bitterness. The Punjab Government is already making enquiries into particular mal-administrations. We consider it preferable therefore, to omit the sentence &quot;they cannot assume &quot; and ending &quot; proof and disproof&quot; and substitute for last sentence the words &quot; They recognise the difficulty of sifting charges made so long after the event, but they will direct the Local Government to undertake enquiries, and take appropriate action in cases where specific complaints are made and action has not already been taken.&quot;Point (4). Penultimate paragraph. We accept the suggested changes, but propose omission of the word &quot;probable&quot; before &quot;consequences&quot; and substitute &quot;has appealed to the hearts &quot; for &quot; has spoken to the hearts,&quot; and to omit the last words &quot; now that enquiry has been closed.&quot;Your last point regarding para. 43-commendation of officers. The Government of India, although they fully appreciate the services of Sir Harcourt Butler and Roos-Keppel keeping their provinces quiet during disorders, are unwilling to include in this- paragraph any commendation of officers whose conduct has not been under enquiry. The selection of these two officers for special mention would, moreover, be most invidious to others, including Ronaldshay and Gait, who also had very difficult conditions to contend with and handled them with success.We turn now to the text of His Majesty&apos;s Governments announcement. We understand that substance of announcement is practically certain of acceptance by the Cabinet, and we-confine ourselves to a few suggested modifications on points of cardinal importance.Firstly, i-n the passage dealing with General Dyer we venture to recommend that after the words &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government repudiate emphatically the doctrine &quot; the words &quot; of frightfulness &quot; be omitted. Our objections to the use of the word are firstly : it connotes a suggestion of brutality for brutality&apos;s sake and it has not been suggested that General Dyer acted from mere lust of brutality ; secondly, the use of the word is inaccurate in so far as it implies any (? adoption corrupt group) by him of purposes which&apos; are usually characterised by that term. His own expression was &quot;the (? question of producing) a moral effect&quot; ; thirdly, it adds nothing to the force of the condemnation passed ; fourthly, it will be seized by the Extremist Press and used as a headline and catchword to inflame widespread ill-feeling, the obliteration of which is desired with equal earnestness by yourself and the Government of India.2, We suggest that the heading of point (2) be altered to &quot;the justification for declaration and continuance of martial law.&quot; The use of the words &quot; delay in revoking &quot; implies a judgment which the text, does not support.- 3. Point (3) deals with the date from which Ordinance IV. of 1919 took effect. &quot;We venture to hope that the last sub-para, may be omitted or the language modified. As it stands it may be construed as a public censure on the Government of India. It goes beyond anything stated by the Committee. Our reason for fixing the date of 30th March was that the actual outbreak of the disorders occurred at Delhi, and our information at the time was that whole disorders were one connected movement. The emergency was great and the ordinance was drafted at a momemVs notice. We have in our resolution endorsed the findings of the Committee as to use of this ordi-jiance in particular cases.   We trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will find it
sufficient to point out the necessity Cor carefully limiting the scope of any similar ordinance promulgated in future.Fourth Point. Administration of martial law. We (? venture to suggest) that the (?) judgment, though nominally qualified, is too severe a verdict of sweeping condemnation of men who worked under stress of very great difficulty and danger, and we would ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider the effect of such an announce-ment not only on the many Punjab officers who behaved throughout with propriety and judgment (? but also) directly the military whose general (? conduct) (corrupt) and (corrupt) restraint deserved the highest praise, but also change on the civil and military throughout India who may at any moment be faced with similar difficulties. We have endeavoured in our para. 43 to press with discrimination, but effect of our words would be little (two corrupt groups) if His Majesty&apos;s Government confined their attention to the cases which deserved reproach. We are prepared, as our resolution states, to deal with officers who have unduly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness and necessity, but we cannot concur in a pronouncement which would give general public cause to believe that these cases were the ride and not the exception. We would particularly ask for a reconsideration of criticism of Hunter Committee in this connection, for the omission of comparison of other officers with General Dyer, and for the exclusion of the words regarding spirit of an &apos; army of occupation&apos; in a hostile country, which are sure to be seized upon by the Extremist Press. In the same paragraph we hope the language in the passage regarding abdication of civil control will be modified. Throughout the period of danger while we recognised that military authority must be supreme, military officers did in fact keep in close touch with the&apos;civil authorities and seek their advice. Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer was in close touch with the Military Commander at Lahore, and placed the services of his civil officers freely at the disposal of the military. The crawling order may be instanced as one in which civil authorities interfered without delay, and the control exercised over whipping may also be instanced.Lastly.* We venture to enter a respectful protest against the language used regarding Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer, and to ask for its reconsideration. We have expressed our own views in our resolution, and we adhere to them. In any case it is, in our opinion, the duty of Government to apportion praise and blame in such circumstances, and we cannot think it right that it should be left to history to give the verdict. His Majesty&apos;s Government will doubtless consider the effect on the public mind of a judgment couched in language which if it does not definitely attribute blame to an officer who was faced with a situation of surpassing difficulty and quelled a rising which if not promptly checked might have spread disaster through India. He should not, in our opinion, be deprived of the credit that is due for his inestimable services in this respect because certain acts were committed which at this distance of time are adjudged to be mistakes. The tenure of Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer&apos;s office coincided almost entirely with the period of the Avar. In the matter of lndia&apos;s aid to the Empire he did great and notable services, and if in the discharge of this work he felt it necessary to enforce war restrictions within his province in the interest of the public ,tranquillity, it was in the sincere conviction that this policy alone could secure the greatest possible military assistance from the Punjab for the Empire. Moreover, we cannot be unmindful of the fact that he was kept on with your concurrence beyond the settled date of his departure in order to combat the rebellion, and a verdict in the terms proposed would be a sorry return.We have already expressed the hope that the observations above expressed will have the result of bringing the expression of our views and those of His Majesty&apos;s Government into closer conformity. We trust you will recognise the difficult position in which we were placed in being asked to incorporate in our resolution language which censures ourselves, criticises the Committee and condemns our officers to an extent which we are not prepared to endorse and at the same time not allowed to publish their own decision. The embarrassment might be avoided, but the prejudice to the public interests of India would be equally great if similar implications were conveyed in a separate pronouncement of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and we trust that in this view Mis Majesty&apos;s Government will be willing to accept such moclifica-tions in the language used as will avoid the danger we have pointed out.* Note. This was telegraphed before the Government of India received the telegram informing them of the modification of this passage by the Cabinet.
9 9 4 tiCirculated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, Home Department, V &apos; dated nth May 1020. /\jb. ihyo. Hunter Committee. 1 have now discussed with Cabinet Committee your telegram dated 11th instant, and they have decided on the following modifications in text of their pronouncement as telegraphed to you on 6th instant and as amended by my telegram of 11th, partly in order to meet your views and partly independently.1. In item 7, in explanation of words &quot; Danda Fauj,&quot; omit words &quot; meaning Band of Clubmen &quot; and substitute words &quot; which may be translated as &apos; Army of Stiekbearers.&apos;2. In same item, omit words &quot; of frightfulness.&quot;8. Last sentence of this item will probably be as follows&quot; Brigadier-General Dyer, therefore, has been relieved of his command in India by the Commander-in-Oliief in India, and has been called upon by the Army Council to retire.&quot;But please note that this sentence must not be included in documents as published unless you have meanwhile received express authority to include it.4, Item 2. Alter heading to &quot; The justification for the declaration and continu-ance of martial law.&quot;&apos; 5. Same item.   After words &quot; earlier abrogation was possible &quot; substitute comma for full stop and insert following : &quot; though His Majesty&apos;s Government can feel little doubt that this argument would have been less pressed than it has been, had there been no ground for complaint of the manner in which in some cases martial law was administered.&quot;6. Item 3, second paragraph. Substitute for the words &quot; the lessons of the past,&quot; the following: &quot; the acts committed under Ordinance IV. of 1919 which it is impossible not to disavow.&quot;7. In same sentence omit words &quot;that having regard to the use made of Ordinance IV. of 1919, the date chosen for the earliest limit of its applicability was too early.&quot;8. Item 4. sentence beginning &quot; But the Local Government should be asked to convey,&quot; is now recast as follows : &quot; But His Majesty&apos;s Government must express strong disapproval of these orders and punishments, and ask me to leave to you the duty of seeing that this disapproval shall be unmistakably marked by censure or other action which seems to you necessary upon those who were responsible for them. The instances cited by the Committee, &amp;c.&quot;9. Same paragraph. Omit sentence beginning &quot; In an earlier chapter &quot; down to &quot;is the greater.&quot; .10. Same paragraph, penultimate sentence. Omit words from and including &quot;given less cause for the impression&quot; dowu to &quot; entirely ceased,&quot; and substitute &quot;been able to retain a larger measure of control2 over the administration of martial law.11. Item 5.   Substitute following for whole of this paragraph : &apos;&quot; With regard to the use of bombing aeroplanes at Gujranwala on the 14th April, the majority of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee expressed their views as follows: &apos;As to the use of bombs from aeroplanes, we do not think that this would be defended by anyone save in cases of urgent need, in the absence of other means, and under the strictest limitations even then. In our opinion the first two of these conditions were present in full force   .   .   .   .   We are not prepared to lay down as a charter for1 By a subsequent telegram this lias been corrected to &quot;Bludgeon Army.&quot; 2 By a subsequent telegram this has been corrected to &quot;contact with.&quot;10 1521      100  5.20a 1
-rioters that when they succeed in preventing the ordinary resources of Government from being utilised to suppress them, they are exempt from having to reckon with such resources as remain.&apos; They then proceed to state that no blame can be imputed to the Hying officers concerned for carrying out the, instructions given to them, but that the action taken under the instructions given illustrates their defectiveness, and they conclude by a recommendation that the formulation of instructions to be given to flying officers in future in similar circumstances should form the subject of careful investigation.&quot; In endorsing these conclusions, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to state clearly that reconnaissance, communications, propaganda-dropping and moral effect summarise the normal and correct use of aircraft under conditions of unrest in normally peaceful countries. But emergencies may occur when, owing to distances or damage to communications or both, and the progress of murderous mob violence and arson, which there is no other means of checking, exceptions from this general position are not only justified but necessary. Although it is impossible to guarantee by general or special instructions that machine-guns or bombs will affect only crowds which would be justifiably tired upon if troops were available on the ground, the employment of armed aircraft in such emergencies should be resorted to in future only as the result of explicit orders in writing given by a civil authority for a limited amount of bombing and machine-gun fire to be employed to overawe mobs, which are, so far as the airman can judge, actually engaged in crimes of violence. The Government will see to it that instructions on these lines are issued as soon as possible. They&apos;regret fully agree with Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee that the instructions issued to the airmen who visited Gujranwala on this occasion left much to be desired in precision, and they think that such action as Your Excellency *s Government may think lit should be taken to bring home their condemnation of these instructions to the officers responsible for them.&quot;12. Item 6. In revised text as telegraphed to you on 11th instant make following-alterations : In first sentence insert &quot; do not&quot; before &quot;regard,&quot; and omit &quot;not&quot; before &quot; immune.&quot;In sentence beginning &quot;as regards the unfortunate results &quot; -(a) Omit all wrords from  and including &quot;unfortunate results&quot; down  to&quot; authorities in the.&quot; (6) Insert &quot; generally &quot; after &quot; martial law.&quot;(c) Substitute &quot; to advise on &quot; for &quot; as advisers on,&quot; and substitute &quot; to control &quot;for &quot; in control of.&quot;(d) Substitute &quot;your Government&quot; for &quot; the Government of India.&quot;In third paragraph substitute &quot; widespread impression&quot; for &quot; widespread belief.&quot;Substitute &quot;impression&quot; for &quot;atmosphere.&quot;Substitute &quot;by which he was faced &quot; for &quot;of the situation which faced him.&quot; Insert &quot; and honoured &quot; before &quot; connection with India.&quot; End of corrections in text of His Majesty&apos;s Government announcement. *2. I accept your advice regarding the wording of the modifications which I suggested in your draft Resolution. I agree to the absence of reference to the heads of other provinces.3. After ail these alterations it is apparent that there still remains some divergence between your views and those of His Majesty&apos;s Government, more particularly in regard to use of Ordnance IV. and administration of martial law. We have both done our best to eliminate differences; but neither time nor the strength of our convictions will permit of further efforts in that direction. I must therefore reluctantly abandon the hope of getting the conclusions and orders upon Lord Hr.nter&apos;s Report presented in one self-contained public document.4. I have carefully considered the procedure proper to the circumstances. The publication of a resolution by your Government, and of simultaneous reflections by His Majesty&apos;s Government, would be confusing and indefinite. We have discussed and rejected other alternatives. The only course that remains is that which I must now. with the fullest concurrence of my colleagues, ask you to adopt. You should throw your draft resolution into the form of a despatch. It will require little more than verbal alteration, and you would no doubt preface it by explaining that, after informal discussion with, me, you. consider the subject so important that, in place of issuing a resolution with my concurrence, you have thought it best to submit the
report, with your views and. recommendations upon it, for the formal orders of His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. You should then telegraph to me the exact textual changes which you make in your draft resolution for the purpose of converting it into a despatch, assuming for this purpose that the passages I. suggested have been inserted (with the modifications agreed to in para. 2 of this telegram) in the draft as forwarded with your Home Secretary&apos;s letter of 8th April. You need not repeat those already communicated in your telegrams of 17th, 18th and 22nd April. I shall expect among your changes a paragraph descriptive of Mr. ShafPs views where they differ from those of his colleagues, or any minute of dissent which he may wish to attach to your despatch.I send you herewith the full text which I propose to issue as my reply to wan-despatch, and which has the i ipproval throughout of my colleagues. I should explain that the draft has been prepared on three assumptions : (1) That your resolution as recast into a despatch will contain, without substantial modification, other than those agreed between us, all the additions and substitutions in your original draft which 1 proposed.(2) That your despatch will not contain the words in para. 82 of your draft &quot; but the Government of India cannot find that Sir M. OT)wyer treated the educated classes with any unfairness or want of consideration,&quot; which I cannot endorse as it stands.(3) That your despatch will not contain the last sentence of para. 34 of your draft.The text of my despatch is as follows. The paragraphs to be numbered 2 to 8 inclusive will consist of His Majesty&apos;s Governments announcement as previously telegraphed and as modified by this telegram and by my telegram of the 11th instant, leaving the headings and heading numbers intact, and the numbers 2 to 8 being inserted at the beginning of the first paragraph after each heading : u His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the Report of Lord Hunters Committee upon the disturbances which occurred in the Punjab and other parts of India in the early part of last year. They have further been informed by me of the conclusions at which Your Excellences Government had arrived in your own review of the Report, as expressed in your letter dated the May, the text of which you have telegraphed to me. The Report and your letter naturally cover ground which His Majesty&apos;s Government did not feel called upon to survey in detail, but their consideration of the matter had led them to definite decisions upon, certain of the more important questions arising out of the Report, and they have desired me to communicate to yon, in ray reply to your letter, their considered statement of these decisions. The paragraphs numbered 2 to 8 of this despatch contain, accordingly, this statement.2-8. (Text already telegraphed.)9. As to the conclusions which Your Excellencv&apos;s Government have recorded on other matters arising out of this Report, I am glad to rind that I am in general accord with your views, save in so far as otherwise appears from the foregoing paragraphs, and I have little further to. add at the present moment. Your Excellency&apos;s Govern-ment will, however, understand that this correspondence, carried on by telegram with a view to the avoidance of delay in publication of documents in which the public, both in India and in this country, is vitally interested, is not necessarily a final settlement of all the large questions involved. In particular, I shall expect you to submit for my early approval the draft of the Martial Law Manual, which you have under consideration. To this matter I attach the utmost importance. I need hardly say that I most earnestly trust occasion may never arise for the enforcement of such rules. But this inquiry will have served a valuable purpose if it results in the enact-ment of a code of regulations calculated to ensure, so far as human foresight can serve, a system of administration which, is at once adequate to repress disorder, to secure the speedy, just and fitting punishment of its promoters, and which yet subverts no more than the fu.lulm.ent of these requirements necessitates the ordinary rights and course of life of the people at large, and the settled processes of civil justice and government. For certain conditions which threaten the existence of the State, martial law is a necessary remedy, but it is a remedy which, unless applied with wisdom and good judgment, loses its value. It is therefore incumbent upon us to do all in our power to prevent, the depreciation of its value by misuse. The same observations apply, in my judgment, to deportation, an expedient which in its present form it is so
notoriously difficult to employ, and the effects ol which are so incapable of exact estimation.10. Plis Majesty&apos;s Government have found it necessary to criticise in strong terms the conduct of certain officers charged with the administration of martial law, and Your Excellency&apos;s Government have indicated that all proved cases of abuse of their powers on the part of subordinate officers of the Police and other Services will receive due notice. Put these exceptions apart, Mis Majesty&apos;s Government desire me to express to you in no uncertain terms their warm endorsement of your appreciation of: the conduct of officers and men, both civil and military, both British and Indian, upon whom fell the heavy task of assisting the people of India to recover their fair name for loyalty and orderliness. The burden thus imposed upon the officers and men of His Majesty&apos;s British and Indian Armies, of hisPolice Force and of his Civil Services, who had already borne with fortitude, but not without fatigue, the trials and strain arising from a long drawn war, was a heavy one. In setting themselves to their task, these men proved true to the great traditions of their services.His Majesty&apos;s Government desire me further to give expression to the profound regret which they, equally with Your Excellences Government, feel for the loss of life which these disturbances occasioned, and to their deep sympathy with those to whom the events have brought personal bereavement.11. In conclusion, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire mo to give expression to the sense of obligation which they feel to Your Excellency personally for the manner in which -you have fulfilled your high trust. Great as is always the burden borne by the Governor-General of India, world-wide circumstances have combined to lay upon you a degree of anxiety such as has only at long intervals fallen upon any of your illustrious predecessors. His Majesty&apos;s Government desire that you should be fortified by the knowledge that they continue to repose the fullest confidence in Your Excellency&apos;s discretion, inspired as they feel certain it has constantly been by the single aim of the good of the peoples whose government is committed to your charge.&quot;End of Despatch.If you have no observations to make beyond sending amendments of your resolution, please inform me of earliest date by which you can be ready for publication.
