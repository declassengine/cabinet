L,G. 29.Jjjjj^g^^^^cticn of rents and security of tenure in the case ofand &quot;business premises.&apos;^MBWmWVU BY THE M3:iTISTER OP HEALTH. There can &quot;be no doubt that when the new Rents Restriction Eill is before Parliament an effort will be made to extend its provision to the case of shops and business premises. There is ample evidence to show that tenants of shops and business premises have serious grievances at the present time, arising from -(a) the demand for an increased and often extortionate rent as a condition of the renewal of a lease, and(b) the threat of eviction by purchasers of the property who desire it for the extension of their own businesses, being prevented by recent legislation from building themselves the first of these grievances exists in all parts of the country. The second is more acute in some places than in others;   Newcastle and Manchester may be cited as examples *2*    A dwelling house is not the less a dwelling house because part of it is used as a shop or otherwise for the purpose of business;   and the new Bill will therefore meet the case of most of the small shopkeepers, except in so far as the standard rent or the rateable value of their shop or premises exceeds  105 iniLondon and  78 in the rest of the country.    Lock-up shops are, of course, outside the Acts, however small their vah-ie may be.3*     It would be a simple matter to amend ,ther Bill b% extending: thB^protecJ^^on.^noy^enj^ed b^J^enants of dwelling houses to tenants of premises of the same valu&amp; used exclusive?^ for busine ss purposes *     It would be very difficult to justify forthis/
this pm-pose a higher value for business premises, and any attempt to do so would produce a movement which it would be scarcely possible to resist for emending the protection of the Acts to dwelling houses of similar value.    To do the latter would be to go much beyond the recommendations of the Salisbury Committee.4i    The above suggestions would not. however, meet the grievances to which reference has already been made.    These arise partly because in the present state of trade demand for offices and other business premises Hire far outstripped supply, and partly because the restrictions imposed by recent legislation on building other than house building has made it impossible for the time being that any serious effort: should be made towards increasing the supply,    There is, no doubt, a great deal of profiteering in rents;   but oases are constantly coming to light where a trader, unable to extend his premises by new building owing to existing restrictions, endeavours to supply his needs by purchasing neighbouring buildings and then proceeds to evict the sitting tenants.    It may often be difficult to say whether public advantage would be better served by protecting the tenants or by allowing the enterprising tradesman to extend his operations but in some instances it is the luxury trader who is seeking to increase the sale of his goods at the expense of more useful citizens;   and it seems unlikely that public opinion will allow this state of things to continue without an effort being made to check it.5*    One method would be to give local authorities power to prohibit evictions from business premises in cases where they were satisfied that on a balance of convenience it was to the advantage of the community that the eviction should not takeplace.
1 9X elplace.    This power would be in a sense correlative to that which local authorities now possess under the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919, to prohibit building other than house building, and might be given for the same period as the latter, viz., to December 1921.    The obvious objection to it is the varying calibre of local authorities, and the danger of corruption which might arise if so ex-tensive a power were placed in the hands of persons who would often be neighbours or competitors of those seeking their assistance and I would not recommend its adoption.6.    If any legislative action is to be taken, it would seem desirable that it should be of universal application and on very broad and general lines.    It is suggested that provision might be made whereby the tenancy of all business premises expiring on and after (say) 25th Maroh, 1920. was extended upon the same terms and conditions of the expiring tenancy/or a period which might perhaps end on December 25th 1921     It would be necessary in such a case to permit an increase of rent not exceeding 50$ of the rent reserved by the expiring tenancy.    A provision of this kind would merely stereotype the existing state of things for 184months, pending a consideration of all the problems in-volved in the position of town tenantsj   and it would probably be necessary for the Government to give an under-taking that this investigation would be set on foot and permanent legislation, if necessary, introduced.If it is thought that the suggestion in paragraph 6 goes too far in stereotyping, existing Tenancies it might be possible to allow an appeal to the &quot;Court&quot; (defined as in S.30(3) of the Housing Act 1919) who might determine the tenancy/
tenancy &quot;on the ground that tke landlord requires possession of the property in order to carry out some scheme of reconstruction or improvement desirable in the public interest&quot; (of, clause 5 of the landlord and tenant Bill), subjeot possibly to the payment of com-pensatlon for loss of goodwill etc.7,    It may be difficult., if the above protection is given to tenants of business premises, to resist the ex-tension of it to tenants of dwelling houses of a value over the limits laid down by the new Rents Restriction Bill. There seems no sound reason why, if it is pressed for, this protection should not be given subject to the same terms and conditions.     It would be unusual to find a case of a dwelling house of a value over the limits laid down by the Rervbs Restriction Bill let for a term less than a tenancy from year to year at the least, and problems which ar:-,se in the case of small houses by the week or month would not, therefore, be so likely to create difficulty.8.    The alternative to the above proposals would seem to be the immediate setting up of fair rent courts or some machinery of the kind.     In the time at the disposal of the Government, apart, from any other considerations, legislation for this purpose is clearly impossible.     It is suggested, therefore, that if it becomes necessary to deal with premises other than those covered fry the Rent Restriction Bill in its present form, some temporary provision on the lines indicated is the only possible course to adopt.Ministry of Health. 0.
