THORNEYBURN and GREYSTEAD (UNION OF BENEFICES) BILL.

Admiralty Memorandum for the Cabinet.

I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a draft Bill for the amalgamation of the Greenwich Hospital livings of Thorneyburn and Greystead.

In a memorandum on the subject the Parliamentary Council stated his opinion that the amalgamation could be effected under the Union of Benefices Act, 1919, and that another Bill is unnecessary and might meet with a certain amount of opposition on that account. On the Ecclesiastical Commission being consulted however it was advised that while the union of the two benefices might be carried out under the 1919 Act, difficulties and delay might be anticipated if that Course were adopted, and that it would therefore be preferable to proceed by a special Bill.
