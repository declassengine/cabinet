0 f&quot; p(Thio document is the property of His Britannic    LM J Maj c s ty1 s Gove rument).CABINET. ^3SECR3T Intemotional Conference at Genoa on Seamen.Joint Memorandum as to the instructions to he given to the Government delegates submitted by the two Government delegates oa behalf of the Ministry of Labour and the Board of Trade.1. The following are the Agenda for the Conference,and of these tho first dealing with the hours of work lamuoh the most important1. Application&quot; to seamen of the Conveatioa drafted at Hashing ton, last November, limiting the hours of work in all industrial undertakings, including transport by sea and, under conditions to be determined, transport by inland waterways, to 8 hours in the day and 48 in the week.Consequential effects as regards manning and the regulations relating to accommodation and health on board ship. . Supervision of articles of agreement.   Provision of facilities for finding employment for seamen.   Application to seamen of the Convention and Recommendations adopted at Washington in November last in regard to unemployment and unemployment insurance.3. Application to seamen of the Convention adopted at Washington prohibiting the employment of ohildren under 14- years of age.4.. Consideration of the possibility of drawing up an International Seamenre Code.8. On the main question of hours of labour on board ship, the    shipowners and the officers and men have been endeavouring to come to some arrangement, but without success. The men&apos;s representatives take up the position that a 48 hour week was definitely given them by the Washington Convention, Unfortunately that Convention is not clearly expressed: the document refers to the &quot;adoption of certain proposals with &quot;regard to the application of the principle of the 8 hours day and 48 hours week&quot; - and includes shipping under the&quot;industrial undertakings&quot; included in the Convention, but-adds that the &quot;provisions relative&quot; to shipping should be determined by a special Conference - i*e. the one now to be held at Genoa.
As is shown &quot;by the Report, dated 19th May, 1980, by Mr. G. N. Barnes and Sir Maloolm Delevingne (CP.1329), tho intention of the Washington Conferenoe was to leave the whole question of hours at sea to bo deci&amp;Ad by the new Conference.    Shipping was not on tho igenda at Washington and was not in fact discussed.This is being brought to the notice of the men&apos;s representatives, and it is hoped that at Genoa they will be prepared to deal with the question on its merits. The shipowners emphatically take the view that the whole matter is open and that nothing done at Washington binds thorn.-3.   There is no doubt that some principle for regulating the hours of labour on board ship will have to be laid down at tho Genoa Conference, and from information supplied by the International Labour Office it appears that practically all the more important maritime Powors would be prepared to accept or consider the principle of a 56 hour week subject to the necessary safeguards, exceptions and qualifications.It is proposed that the British Government delegates at tho Genoa Conference should be authorised, if the other important maritime nations agree, to accept the principle of the 56 hour week subject to such exceptions and qualifioations as may be necessary to safeguard British interests.     The 56 hour week will apply when the ships are at sea, and a shorter time could be accepted in port.     At present under agreement between employers and employed, a 44 hour week is already in force on ships in port.4.   The kind of exceptions that will have to be provided for are the following(a) Special classes of men, such, for instance,as stewards aod lasoare may have to be dealt with excoptionally.(b) Exceptional treatment may have to be givento special classes of vessels such as/vessels
vessels below a certain tonnage, ooastero, fishing boats, etc., etc.(c) It may be necessary to give special treatment to ships engaged in special trades.(d) Provision mast be made for cases of inability tocomply with regulations through death, sickness, or acoident.(e) There should be a general power to make any otherclass of exceptions which the disoussion at Genoa may show to be necessary.A further important qualification is that the shipowners must be given sufficient time to adapt their organisation and their ships to the new regulation.   It will mean getting a very large number of additional men, providing accommodation for them involving structural alterations of the ships and supplying additional life-saving appliance.In the case of this and all the other exceptions the representatives of the officers and men should have a right to be consulted as to the exact soope of the exception or qualification to be made.It is believed that shipowners are more or less prepared for a regulation on the above lines and that they would be prepared to accept it if it were international.If 56 hours week be generally accepted a demand for overtime on Sunday will probably be made by the men:   it is not known what attitude the owners in this country or abroad would take as to this.5, Another important question which will be raised at Genoa is as to the amount and character of the accommodation provided for seamen on board ship.   The British regulations on this subject were in process of being revised when war broke out, and our regulations/are
9 r p, Z *j jare behindhand.   The llorwegian regulations are better than oars, and the accommodation on American ships is, generally speaking, superior to ours.It will probably not be possible for the Conference to deal with this question in very great detail, but it is recommended that the Government delegates should be empowered to agree to an improve-ment in amount and character in the accommodation now provided on British ships, due regard being paid to the difference between chips already in existence and new ships.6. The other items on the agenda are of lesser importance.   Item 2 relates to Unemployment Insurance.   Item 3 deals with the prohibition of tho employment of children under 14 years of age, and there is no difficulty about accepting this principle. Item 4 deals with the problem of establishing an International Code for Seamen, and there would be no objection to agreeing in principle that the laws and regulations governing seamen should as far as practicable be made international and uniform.   This question cannot be dealt with in detail at Genoa, and only very general principles could bo laid down.Vt-lPhe Cabinet are requested to approve of instructions being given to the British Government delegates on the above lines.0.
