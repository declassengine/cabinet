MEMORANDUM BY T	HE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER,	I circulate to	the Cabinet for consideration atthe	earliest possible	moment a Treasury note upon our housingliabilities as affecteu by the constant raising of wages in the building trades.I am profoundly anxious about the situate n.   Not only is our financial stability endangered but the housing programme is being made impossible of execution,(Intlld.) A,C,Treasury, S.,&quot;,l.,May .20th, 1920,
1*    Recent occurrences in regard to wages disputes in the building trade in Scotland ha^e brought into relief the very serious position into which the country is drifting as regards the Housing Scheme-.   It seems desirable tha*. the situation should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet, who should be asked to decide whether., notwithstanding the extent to which the Government is committed to proceeding with the Scheme; it &quot;-ay not be desirable to suspend further action until a settlement has been reached with organised labour.2..   The number of houses to be built under the subsidy i.e-, before August 1922, is 300,000 in England and 60,000 in Scotland, costing on the average  1,000 each to build, and the annual deficit on each house is  40 in England and  60 in Scotland.   The Exchequer&apos; is therefore committed to a deficit of, say,  15,600,000 a year in respect of the subsidised houses less the penny rate and any increase in rents, but neither the English nor Scottish Ministry of Health is sanguine of any rise of rents abo^e the figure on which the present deficit has been calculated.   The houses to be built after the expiration of the subsidy period would be 500,000 in England and 70,000 in Scotland.   The possibility that any unsubsidised houses will., if matters go cn as they are going now, e^er be built after 1922 is getting increasingly remote with each successive &quot;increase of cost03.   For the finnclal situation in regard to the scheme, gloomy as it appears from the figures given abo--,  is really much:worse than appears from then owing to the progressive &apos;increases&apos;in the building labour-rates of wage.   The demands &apos; for increased wages in the building trade are &quot;ery heavy and are progressive..   For each penny per hour increase of wage the annual deficit for which the, exchequer^Miias to provide is increased by  3 for each house remaining to be built and a less proportionate sum-for each house in course of e--action,?As
As a certain number of house,s ha^e already been built, it is estimated that the increased cost at the present time of each penny per hour increase of wage would be in the neighbourhood of  800;000&apos;.   The increased cost of any subsequent wage. Increases would of course diminish as houses became completed, and the number loft to be affected, by tho new increase would, consequently be reduced.   Demands are being made for a 6dc increase a&quot;, comparatively short internals.   Given a rise of 3d; an hour e^ery 4 months, the addition to the deficit would possibly exceed  9,000,000 a year, making possibly  25,000,000 in all by the time the subsidy period expires; 26 months hence. And if in August 1922 a further subsidy scheme has perfV oe to be entered intc   the annual Exchequer liabilities will be increased by a 1 &apos;.gure which might run e^en to a hundred millionso4.     The taxpayer, for the ultimate settlement by whom these vast liabilities are being accumulated, is powerless in the matter for the following reasons:-Variations in the building trade rates are made by employers and men in agreement, as far as England is concerned.The factors that may influence the trade in agreeing to a steady growth in the price of labour appear to include:&quot;Men,   The Trade is abnormally short, of labour.   It. was&quot; unprotected during the war and lost men not only to the Forces, but.also by desertions to protected industrieseThe Unions have shewn that- they desire to maintain this shortage, in their refusal of all schemes of dilution and of payment by resultvBefore the war they suffered considerably from unemployment,, during the war they were an unnecessary trade, and. now that their labour is demanded by the country to an extent so greatly in excess of   supply, they naturally want thecountry
country to pay their terms.They arc. aware that the Government is. committed to pay the cost, of any increase in Housing Schemes and that the Cm-ployora have no present interest in keeping down prices,I^i^lpjeis.   By securing the. principle of &quot;open contracts&quot; the employers have ceased to possess any interest in the matter except to keep the men at work am&apos; so save their establish-ment charges0   In the end this may prove short-sighted but for the moment they have a glut of commercial buildings, and in immediate prospect of long programme of State aided House Ejection;   The present building boom is concurrent w-th the prosperity of the engineering and Shipbuilding and the Furnishing Trades and the industries are consequently prepared to agree to extravagant demands of those Unions whose labour they shareoThe Liverpool and Glasgow districts, where there is strong competition owing to Shipbuilding for certain classes of Building Labour, o*g0 joiners and carpenters, set the pace for the rest, of the country, and the anomaly arises that Plasterers and StOne-Masons wages in the North of Scotland might rise 6dn an hour because the Olyde shipbuilders are anxious for early delivery of ship SoAs evidence of the general attitude, two Districts have decided that the rate shall advance a ldc an hour as from the date that the kinistry of Health commences its Housing Schemes.A definite case has occurred of a Factory Owner paying Sd, an hour above the District Hate to the employees of his building Contractor in spite of the latter&apos;s protest. This was done to ensure the rapid erection of the Factory^Until the bulk of employment is under the Government it will not be possible to avoijil paying whatever rate is settled &quot;by the employers and the men,  ,In places where the Government is the predominant employer it may be possible to decline to pay agreed increases on the ground that the proposed rate is aot Genuine., Should this happen the mobility of building labour will
will at once.draft the men away to hi&apos;her ;?aid districts.In Scotland the Board of Lea1th insist that increases shall be authorised by a Competent Authority.   Until now this has been interpreted as the Industrial Court, but a recent refusal of the Court to award a rise, has been followed by an immediate agreement between employers and men to an increase of 3d. an hour.- If this is accepted and the &quot;competent authority&quot; clause waived, Scotland will then fall into line with England, If it is refused housing, will probably stop, and the men transfer to private work on which the.employers are able to pay the new rate such as work in the Clyde District, 5fc    With employers and men in the. relative situation *which the foregoing.paragraphs have set forth it seems essential, that the Government, as trustee for the taxpayer and the nation, must intervene with... some scheme to remedy the situation,   I-or of two things one seems certain to happen; either the Exchequer will be burdened with colossal liabilities in respect of the schemef or the whole scheme for building houses must come to a standstill for lack of-finance.It is idle to pretend that the Exchequer burden can be met by a simple process of taxing the rich.   The taxes mustbe raised either by a levy on the profits of industry or on articles of general consumption.   In either case prices must rise, and in any event it is the bulk of the population which must pay these prices,,   Nobody is .aoing to be really better off. In fact, as always,, the weaker classes financially are sure to be. the first to suffer. &apos; What is now happening is that those of the working classes who are in a strong bargaining position are holding to ransom the rest of the. working classes.Equally, there is no comfort on the other horn, of the dilemma,   Houses are badly needed, and to build them twice.as expensively as they need be built means that only half the number required v.ill be erected.6.     A practical solution is not easy to find,  , But it miaht be possible to direct that no housing contracts shall be concludedwhich
1^9 X d owhich will impose more than a stated amount of deficit. If the employer could be forbidden the open form of contract in Govern^merit housing Contracts (under which increased costs fall on the authority and not on the Contractors) he would begin to take an interest again in wages rates..   This would no doubt drive at first employers and workmen to other forms of building work and mean   a temporary suspension of the Housing Scheme.   But by the time the be cm in factory etc construction was working itself out, the Government housing scheme would be recommenced under more f avo ur a bl c co nd i t i on s,,A further method would be a more drastic handling of the labour shortage including in this term restriction of output. * Bricklayers are now laying less than 200 bricks a day, instead of over 700).     It .is not known in-the Treasury what the attitude of ether Unions is to the Building Trade and how   far the opposition to dilution would be backedyby them, but it is for^ consideration that public attention should be called to the fact that the present rise in building prices is rendering the cost of.production prohibitive, and;that unless the Unions are prepared to accept mass dilution and to remove all restrictions on output the&apos;Housing Schemes-must be abandoned.As things are new going August - 1922 may find the Exchequer committed to an annual subsidy of  2^,000,000 and the country with half a million houses still to build at a cost of  1.^00 each or&apos; 7JO.000.000.
