SECRET.THE CABINET.RESUMPTION OF  TRADE WITH RUSSIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The appended memorandum on the Resumption of Trade with Russia has been circulated to the Cabinet by the Foreign Office with the statement that it was &quot; submitted to the San Remo Conference.&apos;I direct the attention of my colleagues to the three questions which are posed ; but surely there is a fourth question which ought to be considered at the same time, viz. (4) Even if we are forced to accept the Bolshevik terms, and if we do provide the locomotives which they require, and afford them the recognition, &amp;c, shall we get as the result any considerable quantity of grain out of Russia (considering the conditions of famine which prevail in large Russian territories, including the great cities of Moscow and Petrograd, and the breakdown of the Russian system of transport) between now and August, 1921, when, according to this memorandum, famine is expected to be raging in Central Europe.A fifth consideration appears to be would it not be better to wait and see what Government is likely to be in control at the end of next harvest of the principal granary of Russia the Ukraine ? Surely, if there were two Governments in Russia next autumn, one in power in Moscow and the starving Northern Provinces, and the other in power in the Ukraine, and in control of Odessa and of the railways leading straight into Poland, Czecho-Slovakia and Austria, it would better suit our economic purpose to deal with the latter rather than the former.I must record my opinion that Mr. Wise&apos;s memorandum raises an altogether false issue, namely, that we have to choose between &quot;virtual recognition of the Soviet Government&quot; on the one hand, or &quot;starvation and disease in Europe on an unprecedent-dented scale,&quot; on the other. There is no real relation between these two. There is no reasonable probability of any large quantities of  rain being obtained from Russia in the period in question, or of restoring the transport system of that country. All evidence shows that the Bolsheviks are acting in bad faith, and that apart from the gold which they have seized they have no effective means of paying for any articles they import.w. s. c.The Was Office,llth May, 1920.APPENDIX.MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO THE SAN REMO CONFERENCE.- The course of our discussions with the Bolsheviks is described in the memorandum submitted by Mr. Wise. Stated in its simplest terms the position now seems to be as follows : We want Russian grain ; the Russians want British locomotives. The resumption of commerce between England and Russia would in the course of time involve virtual de Jacto recognition of the Soviet Government, and perhaps some kind of &quot; peace negotiations.&quot;   We are anxious that trade should be resumed without recognition, or at(B20/226)   100   5/20  H&amp;S  821 Ivro
least that the resumption of trade should precede a general settlement with the Bolsheviks. In order to decide upon a policy, it is necessary to reach conclusions upon the following questions: 1. Do the Bolsheviks want locomotives so badly that they will agree to a resumption of trade with us without a general settlement, or, in other words, can we get Russian grain without giving recognition ?2. If they cannot get locomotives, will the result be an economic breakdown, followed by the disappearance or modification of the present Russian regime ?3. Can we afford to do without Russian grain, or must we have it even at the cost of recognition ?The Russians seemed to me determined to drive a hard bargain, and, in my judgment, the answer to the first question is that they would withhold their grain and do without our locomotives for the present, in the expectation that our need of grain will force us to accept their terms when the results of the 1920 world harvest are known.I know of no evidence to show that the economic position of Russia is deteriorating. As hostilities against the Soviets grow less intense, it improves. I believe, therefore, that the answer to the second question is in the negative. The third question has perhaps received less attention than the other two, but is vital. Estimates of 1920-21 harvest of breadstuffs iudicate that production is still decreasing and that we shall know definitely by September, 1920, that there are not enough breadstuffs in existence to feed the world till August, 1921, and that the first people to starve will be those in the distressed areas of Central Europe. This estimate is made by the Wheat Commission, and unless it can be upset, must presumably be accepted and be acted on at once by the Foreign Office. If we accept it (and I personally know no reason to question it) we must decide which of two factors is most dangerous to the existing order of society in Europe and to the security of the United Kingdom, namely, virtual recognition of the Soviet Government or starvation and disease in Europe on an unprecedented scale.
