THIS JXXHJMENT 18 THB PBCIESTY OP HIS MAJESTY1 S BRITAINIC GOVERNMENTlORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LiBCUR.Op-^-&quot;^Ni UI^IMGM INST3SABI03! BILL.CP. 1303   Y&quot;&apos; Hi/- &apos; jji^l^Throe important amendments to this Bill were oarrled against the Government in Committee:-(1)   The right to pay out State unemployment benefit is specifically given to Approved Societies;(8)  benefit is made payable from the first day (instead of the seventh day) of unemployment if unemployment lasts as long as a week;(3)   the weekly rates of benefit have been raised from 15s. to 20s. for men and from 12s, to 16s* for women.The first amendment, which will oertainly have a large measure of support in the House, has raised..a storm of protest from the Trade Unions, while.the second and third amendments taken together nearly double the cost of benefit and leave a deficit of over  8,000.000.    Thoseowho voted for the inoreases in benefit&apos;**may very possibly be willing to aocept something less.    It is clear, however, that there is a strong feeling, not merely in the Labour Party, but also among theasupporters of the Government, that the original proposals of the Bill in this connection were quite inadequate.I take it to be common ground that a scheme ef unemployment Insuranoe must ba carried into law this Session, in a form which will meet with a reasonable degree of general acceptance.    Ever since the armistice the Government has placed in the forefront the?&apos; importance of making provision,against unemployment.    We cannot hope to BOlve our industrial difficulties until such provision ie made, and the prime Minister has on several occasions referred to the urgency of the need.    The joint Provisional Committee in the early part of last year, in a report which was accepted by the Government, recommended that action should be taken to deal with/unemployment
1 Qx 0unemployment, hours and wages.    Effect cannot &quot;be given to their recommendation this Session with regard to wages, nor probably with regard to hours.    If now the question of unemplky-ment also is referred to a later date the prestige of the G-overn-raent in the- industrial world will be seriously damaged, and tha reaction on the labour difficulties of tha country may be of the gravest nature.Itfoi the least of the dangers to be apprehended is that, if this oppotunity is lost, it will never again be possible to establish a scheme of Unemployment Insurance on a contributory basis.    The labour party are officially pledged-to.a non-contributory scheme, and a good many employers ore attracted by the ease and facility with which the donation scheme was worked so far as they were concerned.     In the absence of any other alternative the Government will be compelled to meet the next period of serious unemploymentit may be in the coming winter *-by means of a donation scheme, and once this is done the contri^ butory principle is deadj    Without entering into other objectionsto a donaticnTBchome it is sufficient to point- out that tha annual cost of&apos;sueh a scheme to the state. oould hardly be less than  2opOO,000.On the other hamd, if the Bill is to be carried, so as to give satisfaction, substantial concession must be: made in the benefit.    The original benefits could- only be&apos; restorer?,- if at all, after protracted debates for which Parliamentary time is not available, and if they were restored the Bill would,! fear, be regarded with so much dissatisfaction as to be almost worthless as a solution of the Unemployment problem./Vji th
i n i iWith regard to the &quot;Approved Society&quot; amendment. I propose to ie-ope 11 negotiations with the Labour Party immediately and endeavour to induco them to accept some- form of words which will concede to the friendly Societies the right to participate, under proper safeguards, in the administration of this scheme.     I am coirrinced, however, that there is no hope of achieving this object unless I am able to offer the Labour Party in return something substantial in respect of improved benefits.After careful consideration of the matter in all its aspects, I have come to the conclusion that the following benefits are the least that will meet the needs of the case, and that they should be coupled with an increase of contributions from employers,, employed and the State as set out below;-(a)   Waiting Period   -   3 days)   Rates of Benefit - 13sa (men) and 15s. (women)(0)  Weekly Contributions; -Employers.   Employed ...... 5doStateMen   ......Women .....45d.4d, 3d,3d.24(The corresponding contributions under the Bill as introduced were as follows.-MenEmployers 3d.Women......8*Employed 3d.State. 2d.iiThese proposals have been submitted to the Actuary, who advises that the addxtlonal cost of these proposals to the Exchequer would be  1,832,000 annually, and that the total coot to the Exchequer of the Scheme as now proposed including amendments made or accepted by the Government would be  5,39&apos;/,COO annually./This
Thi,-: dost; not include a sum of about  300,000, which will be pai&apos;&quot; to tha Unemployment jPund from Service Votes in respect of Employer a contributions for men discharged from tha forces.I have not lost sight of the difficulty for fixing a higher rate of benefit for unemployment than for sickness, but for the reasons set out above I feel that on increase of unemployment benefit to 18s, and 15s. is essential,    I suggest further that the experience of the Oat-of-Work Scheme indicates that the difference in rates will.not give riso to serious objections.    Moreover, under the Health Insurance Scheme the sickness benefit is only a part of the total benefits to which the insured person is entitle,&quot;1; the medical benefit, in particular, is of substantial pecuniary value.    The Health Insurance Bill has passed through Committee not only with-Out amendment, but without any demand being made for an increase in these rates.    I believe, therefore, that it will be possible to Increase the unemployment benefit rates without thereby placing the Government under any necessity to make corresponding increases in sickness benefit.(Signed) T, 3, MAQlUdWRAMiff IS IKY OF LiiBOUB 18,5,80.
