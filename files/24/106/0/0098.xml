6 &apos;TOS DOCUMENT,IS THE PROPERTY OP EIS BRI5XKHIC MAJESTY1 S GO^RIMNT.HOUSING   LIABILITIES. H.19,11139 6   O*. i H v) &amp; )Memorandum by the Minister of Health,1.    The Treasury Note on Housing Liabilities circulated-by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 20th of May (CP,1350) suggests in effect that the Government should threaten to suspend the Housing Scheme on the ground that increases in gages rates in the building trade are rendering the scheme f inane daily impossible.     In my view the Government would be taking up an entirely false position if they were to make the increase in wages a pretext for abandoning the Housing Scheme,Increase^ 2*    The Meniorwidura by the Minister of Labour of the7th May (C*P J.252) indicates that the continued demand forMgher wages is common to meet trades, and it would bedifficult to shew that the increases obtained by the building trade over pre-war rates can fre regarded as abnormal ascompared with the increases secured by other trades.     Itwould not be easy to convince the Country that the increasein the cost of labour has out-paced the increase in thecost of building materials or has unreasonably exceeded theincrease in the cost of living.    The cost of building materials is being investigated by the Central ProfiteeringCommittee and although this investigation has not yet beencompleted I understand that the Committee are unable to find that there exists serious profiteering in this country,though apparently abnormal profits are being obtained bytimber merchants in Sweden.    The increase of wages rates inthe building trade In London, including the increase f)  &apos;beginning with the 29th of May, is 143 per cent, over the pre-war rates.** l**
0 o cJOutput. 3,    More serious to my mind than the- increase in wagesis the decrease in output.   Cases such as those referred I to in the Treasury note, of bricklayers laying less than800 bricks a day are, I believe, quite exceptional.    But although there is evidence that the rate of output is improving, there seems to be little doubt that, on the average, output is little more than half of what should be expected, and this fact is reflected in the tenders which are obtained from builders.   It is calculated that a reduction of output from 750 bricks a day to 350 involves an additional co3t of  63 per house.   I have already pressed upon the building trade and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, as one of the measures to be taken in view of the grave shortage of labour, the adoption of some machinery whereby output can be increased.    Although no support teas been obtained either from the building trade or from other Trade Unions generally, I am of opinion that a determined effort in this direction should be made.*Form of 4. (a)   One of the grounds to which the higfr cost of contract.... housing schemes is assigned in the Treasury note 16 theadoption of a form of contract by which the employer is protected against increases in the costs of materials and labour and the suggestion is made that the use of this open contract should be abandoned.    It is, of course, obvious that the open contract must operate to diminish the interest of the employer in wages rates and I agree entirely that there should be a return to the policy of fixed tenders at the earliest possible date.   But in the present state of uncertainty it is clear that any attempt to obtain fixed prices would result either in such increases of tenders as-2-
9 0 Hto render them ijrrpos^ible- of ajcoe^ptance or-in. no tenders being received.[ (b)   The further suggestion is made that no contractshould be entered into which will impose more than a statedamount of deficit.    While open contracts continue, it isimpossible to state what the final cost of a house will beand it would be impracticable to proceed with the housing scheme if, before contracts were approved, an agreement hadto be secured with local authorities providing that all lossbeyond a certain amount should be borne either by rents orby local rates.    To insist on this arrangement would beto tear up the agreement with local authorities that their liabilities should be limited to the produce of a penny rate and would effectually bring their activities to an end.Dilution. 5*    I am convinced that there is no prospect of themen agreeing to mass dilution, presented as a separate issue and it would be difficult to make a case for it on financial grounds.proposals as)po to labour.6.    Nevertheless I heartily agree that the difficulties as to labour presant the greatest of all obstacles to good progress of the housing scheme, both in regard to construction and cost.    There are difficulties as to materials and as te finance which I hope may be gradually overcome but the labour difficulty is much the most serious and requires to be handled on a national basis.Various proposals have been made by the Joint Industrial Council of the Building Industry and supplemen-tary suggestions arising out of a conference which I had**3*
9 ^ n**) d with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress are at present under consideration by a Joint Committee of the Federation of Building Trade Employers and Operatives, but this procedure involves prolonged negotiations and may prove ineffective.   It appears to me that the whole strength of the Government should be at once employed to secure a comprehensive settlement and I would suggest that the Prime Minister, with such other Ministers as he may think fit, should place a complete shheme before the executives of the Federations of Employers and Operatives or such other representatives of the Trade as the Minister of Labour may advise are best able to speak for the trade as a whole and to conclude a binding arrangement.    A complete scheme should I think be on the following lines:-(a) There should be a national settlement of the wages rates which are to be accepted for a stated period in different areas and provision should be made for the increase or reduction of these rates thereafter in accordance with rises or falls in the ooat of living*A proposal on these lines is already under con-sideration by a Joint Committee of the Federations of Employers and Operatives, but the procedure appears to be cumbrous and much time may be lost before a final decision is arrived at.(b) The wages settlement should include some form of guaranteed week.A definite scheme for the introduction of the guaranteed week has been prepared by the Committee of&quot;*d*&quot;
9 n O ii -j -Jof operatives appointed a^ter* liry ^crofer^ern^ Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.. This scheme has been before the Committee of Employer-a and Operatives and has for the time being been shelved^This is a matter to which the operativea ^ta/vh^ the very greatest importance.    Their claim is reasonable in principle and I believe that agreement on some form of guaranteed week can be seour-ed,(o)   It is essential that any scheme providing for a guaranteed week should Include a system of payment which while consistent with the principle of protecting the workman from loss of wages owing to bad weather will provide an incentive to him to put in as much work as possible and will also secure an increased output.The question of output is of such importance from the point of view of cost and of speed in the con-struction of houses that improvement in this direction must be made a cardinal point in any settlements(d)   It should be agreed as part cf the settlement that there should be no stoppage of building in any circum-stances as a result of any dispute arising on a housing scheme,le)   A . scheme   should be adopted for the employment as adult apprentices of men demobilised from the forces *(A proposal of this kind is at present under consideration by the Building Resettlement Committee.)(f) Trade Union rules should be relaxed so as to facilitate the entrance of ordinary apprentices to the trade and to shorter, the period of training.(g) Overtime up to a stated amount should be permitted on housing schemes.
9 9 ^(h)   Measures should W^l^e^irOc-Haty-eng^ powers given &quot;by the Housing (Additional Powers) AcrU . OSO^-for prohibiting building which competes with housing *Some extension of the existing powers 6&apos;f prohibiting buildings is necessary in tfrder to provide an effective means of dealing with breaches of the agreement as to wages rates and conditions of employment.The present machinery for regulation of buildings competing with housing is wholly unsatisfactory:   a local authority has no power to deal with buildings in another area which draw away labour from its housing scheme- nor can it deal effectively with the builder or owner;&apos; who offers bonuses or wages in excess of the recognised raxes,he Private 7*    As an auxiliary agency it is I think of the&quot;BuIISer .&apos;greatest consequence that we should give every encouragement to the private builder to induce him to reeiune his normal occupation.   With this end in view I have recently., in 1th the concurrence of the Treasury, increased the amount ofhavethe subsidy to the private builder by  100 per house and X / taken steps to make the scheme and this new concession widely known.Apart from its other advantages it seems to me that if the actual builders can be brought into the scheme on /termc not unduly onerous to the State they will have the best chance of finding a way rou&amp;d ^d difficulties as to labour&apos; and materials and their direct interest in the question of cost 3hould act as a corrective to the influence of the open contracts which local authorities -are for the time being compelled to adopt.
0    o0 d oWith a view to giving further encouragement to these agencies I suggest -(a) that it would be in the interest of the Exchequer in suitable cases to agree to advances being paid to private builders out of the Looal Loans Fund or otherwise;(b) that power should be taken by legislation to extend the time limit for the private builders&apos; subsidy scheme beyond the end of the present ceJLeiufcv year-As provided by the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919.&amp;e Having regard to the rate of progress of the local authorities to the difficulties involved in that method of procedure and to the need for speeding up building during the best season of the year; I propose that greater use be made of the method of direct building by the Office of Works on behalf of the local authorities where such authorities are slow In proceeding or have made no progress at all*   It will be within the recollection of the Government that I proposed in the Housing (Additional Powers) Bill of last Session to take power to undertake direct building in this way and to recover the cost from the local authority- This proposal was made because I felt that it was essential to have some power, short of declaring the local authority in default, of hastening the provision of houses in the area of the dilatory authority. I return, therefore, to my previous proposal and regret that the Government di&amp; not sea fit to adopt It in December last; I am confident that the possession of this power would have enabled me to secure that a large number of additional houses would have been in course of erection

I am of opinion thai; the-method o  direct&apos; bttJJ.rti.ng, jrouJUcl JPraguantly result in economies and it would certainly enable houses to be provided more quickly in many places.   I i^ijrtJaer^str^ngl^r r*eoornmejHf it as likely to facilitate the adoption of newer methods of construction which local authorities are slow to adopt but which would undoubtedly enable us to economise in the use of skilled labour.The postponement of the Government fs own ordinary building programme is an additional reason for employing the resources of the Office of Works in direct building.I propose therefore that a sum of ten millions be provided for house building and that the Ministry of Health be empowered to call upon the Office of Works to build9   fewer should be taken by legislation to enable the Minis-try of Health, to vest the houses so built in the local authority and to recover the capital cost from the local authority.   The best means of enforcing recovery will require further consideration.   It may be necessary to obtain power to raise loans on the security and for the account of the local authority^Ministry of Health. C* Addison,
