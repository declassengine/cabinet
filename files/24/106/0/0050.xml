(This Document is me Property or-&apos;     /  ...    ^ r P1 0 uHis Britannic Majestys Government.)NOTE SUTrtMARISINQ THE CONCLUSIONS OP THE interdepartmental committee ON THE CHIEF OBSTACLES TO THE SUMPTION OF TRADE WITH RUSSIA.The inter-Departmerrtal Russian Trade Committee was set up by&quot;*the Prime Minister on January 23rd, 1920, to oo-ordinate the action of the various Departments concerned in the soheme approved by the Supreme Counoil of the Allies in Paris for the re-opening of trade relations with the Russian peopleoThe Committee is under the Chairmanship of Mr. E.F.Wise, 3rttl4Ui,Jbepr^s^ndtative.

Ministry of Shipping. War- Office, &apos; Admiralty, Colonial Office, Post Office and Ministry of Munitions.&apos;The Committee has performed the work of an Advisory Committee In respect of the policy to be pursued by the represent-sentative of Great Britain on the Permanent Committee of the Supreme Economio Council, which was entrusted by the Supreme -Council of the Allies with the duty of regulating questions of an inter-allied nature arising out of tho resumption of trade between Russia and Western Europe.The Committee has rather confined Itself to the examina-tion of such questions as were likely to arise in the resumption of trade between this country and Russia, and to the considered tion of such difficulties as might present themselves from a purely British point of view.It has collected and disoussed the views on these questions of the various Departments concerned, and its conclusions are briefly summarised below.The most important of the questions likely immediately to arise as points of difficulty to be overoome prior to, or early in the course of. the resumption of trading relations may be grouped under five heads * -1. Questions arising directly from the anomalous legal and diplomatic situations.2* Questions of Governmental restrictions on both sides.3.&apos; Financial questions.4. Transport questions.5e Guarantees.1,   Legal and diplomatic questions.The Soviet Government has no defined legal status In countries from which it has reoeived no diplomatic recognition and, in the course of trade negotiations, the question at once arises whether It can sue or be sued in this oountry.   It is extremely likely that points of this nature will arise out of the disposal by the Soviet Government of gold, securities or commodities to the fv      ownership of which nationals of the Allied Governments may lay claim.   This question cannot satisfactorily be settled exoept in relation to the general problem of foreign debts in Russia, a subject which must presumably be dealt with ultimately by a Treaty between the Governments concerned.
The collection   and collation of British claims on Russia has been considered by a Sub-Committee of the Russian Trade Committee, which is engaged also in formulating for approval a policy in regard to claims generally.   The difficulties arising from the deposit of gold in this country might, however, be evaded by its location in a neutral state, and the agreement made by Krassin and Abrahamson has this end in view.In this connection the Committee has taken note of an intention., expressed in Copenhagen by the Russian Trade Delegation, to form in this country a Limited liability Company amenable to British law,, financed by gold deposited by the Soviet Government in Esthonia or&apos; elsewhere.   In connection with legal processes likely to arise as a result of the arrival in this country, as payment for goods imported into Russia, of gold or other commodities requisitioned by the Soviet Government, the Committee points out that, while it is not possible to forecast the attitude likely to be taken by the Courts in this country upon a legal issue of this complicated kind, the refusal of i  the British Government diplomatically to recognise the Soviet Government i%- not, ipso   facto   enough to prevent an English Court of Law from deciding t&quot;Eat the Soviet Government should be treated for all legal purposes as a de facto   Government.   This is an issue which apparently can be    decided only in the Courts.Arising also from the present   diplomatic situation is the difficulty of the representation of the British Government in Russia, and of the Russian Government in Allied or Neutral countries, for such purposes as may be found necessary as a result of the re-sumption of trading relations.&apos;   Such representatives must enjoy some measure of diplomatic immunity, but, guarantees would have to be required of the representatives of the Soviet Government that no advantage should be taken of their opportunity to spread political propaganda.2,-  Relaxation of *Government restrictions on trade.The exchange of goods between this country and Russia is not now theoretically prevented by the blockade in the Baltic, which is virtually non-existent, but up to the present trade has in practice been prevented by the refusal of H.M, Government to issue export - , licences for goods destined for Russia,,or to give clearance from aj British port to a vessel bound for a Russian port. With regard, j however, to the Black Sea, the Admiralty still finds it necessary t to enforce a blockade against the Bolsheviks.The Russian Trade Committee has recommended the Board of Trade to let it be known that trading through the Baltic is now possible The Admiralty has not yet 3een its way to alter the existing orders in the Black Seaj but the 0, in 0 Black Sea has been notified of the decisions of the Supreme Council.     If the blockade is removed and the customs and port authorities in the United Kingdom   are instructed to sanction trade with Russia, the only restrictions on the export of goods from this country to Russia would be those comprised in lists &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, Beard of Trade regulations, requiring an export licence for certain goods to all foreign destinations, in which Russia would as a matter of course be included.
1 U 0On the other hand, the Russian Trade Committee has no definite information as to the conditions regulating foreign trade in Russia itself.   It is known that some of the States formerly parts of the Russian Empire, are still working on the basis of the 1915 tariff. I        The pre-war tariff was exceedingly complex, and full information will be required on this question, sinoe the fulfilment of contracts either for Import or export may well be rendered unprofitable by the imposition of high customs duties in Russia.    This question, together with that of port dues, etc, can only be fully discussed with the Russian delegation.Arising also from the blockade is the question of postal and telegraphic communications.-    Use of the Peterhead - Alexandrovsk/ Moscow cable is now permitted, but no public announcement has been made as.it was not thought advisable for the moment to encourage traffico   Two other lines are available but have not yet been re-opened.   The re-opening of postal services will be necessary as soon as trading starts.    The Committee recommends that there shall be freedom of telegraphic communication, and that the censorship of postal communication shall be reduced to the lowest possible pro-portions. Postal communication is not yet possible through Esthonia.At its 11th meeting on the 8th May, the Committee had before it a oopy of a Press notice proposed by the Board of Trade, (see oopy attached).This Pressnotioe was laid before the Cabinet on Tuesday, May 18th, and discussion of it was adjourned until the initiation of discussions with the Russian Trade Delegation.3.   Financial arrangements.The original arrangements between the Supreme Council and the Co-operative organisations included a provision that the Oo-operat-ive Societies should be financed at the beginning up, to 25% of the full value of the contracts entered into by them? either direct or through B ritish, French or Italian organisations, or through private traders.The view of the Committee is that in present oircumstanoea financial assistance should only be provided if it is found to be unavoidable.   For the purpose of providing any such financial assistance, the   Export Credits and Insurance schemes could easily be adapted.As regards sales to Russia against gold, it is noted that at present a licence is&quot;&quot;required for the re-export of gold from the United Kingdom, and that, as such licences are not at present being granted to holders of Russian roubles, the latter would only bo accepted at a depreciation of about 25% on the world price of gold. The Committee anticipates that this will prove a serious obstacle in the conduct of the negotiations generally and more particularly to their centralisation in Londoni    Some modification of the existing arrangement may, therefore, be required.Otherwise, the probability is that the bolshevists will send their gold elsewhere and will endeavour to centralise their negotiations elsewhere.   This might have injurious effects of a lasting nature on British trade with Russia&apos;*    The matter  is still under the consideration of the Treasury.4.    Transport.&apos;y As regards transport by sea from Russia to this country, it isnot anticipated that any difficulty will be encountered; on the other hand, the condition of Internal transport in Russia is deplorable.   It has been suggested by the Russian delegates that
1GDthe first shipments from the United Kingdom should consist of railway material, against gold.The Russians have already made, or are discussing arrangements for the supply of railway material with Sweden, with the United States and with German firms.    There are a number of trucks made to Russian gauge belonging to the British Government, available for immediate export from camp..The question of the actual working of the Russian pallw^p and ports, with a view to expediting export and import, will require very careful discussion between Allied and Russian exportf. Considerable information is already available in the Communication^ Section of the Supreme Economic Council as to such organisation. The course that seems most likely to be immediately effective is, that efforts should be concentrated in the first plaoe on ., particular lines, so as to get them working satisfaotQrliyt   A^ the same time, the repair workshops serving such lines wpuld m put right by B ritish or Allied technical assistance and machinery&apos;. Plans were worked out for this purpose for South Russia a few months ago and discussions have already taken place with  Ijrltlsh locomotive firms for the purpose of examining this project&apos;.    The w existence of the war with Poland obviously complicates the matter.5.    Guarantees.In view of the instability of the Russian internal situation, It is important that adequate guarantees are obtained from the Soviet Government that foreign property either in the form of imported goods or those awaiting shipment from Russia receives proper security.   In close relation to this is the necessity of having British representatives at the Russian ports to look after British Trade Interests.The question of the conditions under which bolshevist ships should be admitted into British ports, has received 2jnsideration. Similar questions arose during the Armistice negotiations witn Germany and the precedents are useful.   There appears to be no objection to bolshevist s2tips ooming into B ritish ports, but the crews would not, in general be allowed to land.With regard to B ritish ships entering bolshevist ports, guarantees as to the safety of the ships and of the crews, as to the time during which they can be unloaded, and on other matters, would have to be obtained from the bolshevists.    It will almost certainly be necessary also to send at any  rate trade representaw tives to do the actual mechanical business of the ships in the Russian portsi-27.5.1920.
H.122.3^estadmlro8eTngcrtl(^naai,t^i resumption of private trade between the United Kingdom and Russia^The Board of Trade announce that there is no legal obstacle to prevent British subjects from onto ring into commercial and financial transactions with persons in Russia, and that no export licences are required for the present for the export to Russia of any goods in List 0 of prohibited exports (i.e, for any goods for which expert lioencos are. not required for all foreign destinations.)It should be understood that traders must mako thoir own arrangements, and that they undertake transactions entirely at their own risk.She passage of ships and cargoes to Russia is not at present interfered with proridod that arms and munitions are not carried, subject, however, in the case of the*Black SoaT tt the discretion of the $aval Authorities.Kay 7th, 1920,
