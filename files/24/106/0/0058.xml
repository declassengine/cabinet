SecretCP, 1 3 57Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.This Document is the Property ofHis ^YLilo&quot;^/&apos;.) 0 ivornrnent.195lition of India in regard to an Imperial Currency System.^ HaU Gl^5^^ Memorandum of Sir L. Worthuigtoii Evans and Colonel Amery on Imperial E^ltnlige and Currency (Cabinet Paper III7), covering notes by Mr. Darling and Major Grogan, raises wide questions. The following observations are particularly directed to the concrete proposal at the end of the joint Memorandum as to whether the Government of India should not he induced to fix the rupee at 2s. sterling instead of 2s. gold, until such time as sterling can be brought back to its old gold parity. This view is apparently also held by Mr. Darling, and possibly also by Major Grogan, though not long ago the latter was publicly denouncing the abandonment of the pre-war ratio of the rupee of 15 to the pound, which was then synonymous with the sovereign, and it is not clear from his statement that &quot; India has lost both principles, but the power to remedy the position remains with the Imperial Government,&apos;&apos; whether he still thinks that the earl)7 return of a Is Ad. rupee is to be recommended.2. Fixation of the rupee at 2s. sterling is advocated in the joint Memorandum on the ground of the unpopularity in India of the present currency scheme, and of its anti-Imperial character.The effects of the new policy on India may first be considered. The joint Memorandum states that the recent decision to fix the rupee at 2s. gold &quot; appears to &quot; have given serious dissatisfaction in India itself, where it has been misrepresented &quot; as a deliberate device to subsidise British imports into India at the expense of &quot; Indian industries and to augment the pay of Anglo-Indian officials and pensioners.&quot; It should be noted that these objectionable suggestions were first made, so far as is known, in a letter from Major Grogan in The Times of loth February, and if they have found a ready response in India much may be ascribed to their successful exploitation on this side by Major Grogan, whose letter was reprinted and circulated by parties in India interested in restoring a low exchange value to the rupee.3. The reasons which led the expert Committee, presided over by Sir Henry Babington-Sinith, to recommend the fixation of the rupee at 2s. gold, are fully stated in their Report (Command paper 527/192U). It is not proposed to traverse in detail the ground they covered. It is sufficient to say that the report is a weighty and reasoned statement in favour of the policy which, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State decided to adopt.4. When the Currency Committee reported, the exchange value of the rupee, which before the war had been maintained for many years at Is. 4c/., had been raised by successive stages to 2s. 4c/. The Committee were satisfied that India&apos;s trade and industrial development would not be seriously hampered by the high rate of exchange, which they were convinced was necessary if the Indian monetary system was to be maintained on a secure basis. One essential condition, of this is that the Secretary of State should have a fair prospect of being able to buy silver for coinage, without loss, in order to maintain the convertibility of the note. But the high prices of silver that have ruled in recent years, and are still ruling, render a high exchange necessary for this purpose, seeing that the alternative of reducing the silver content of the rupee was ruled out for good and sufficient reasons. The Committee were also satisfied, having regard to the conditions under which the mass of the population in India live, that it was very desirable to secure for them a continuance of the influence of a high exchange as tending to mitigate the rising curve of prices. The choice thus lay between (1) a high sterling rate, say 2s. ijd. or more, and possibly reducing it later by official action to a new normal rate to be determined hereafter, pending which time an elaborate scheme of currency control would have to be continued, or (2) linking with gold at some such rate as 2s., which gives a reasonable prospect of removing controls at a relatively early date, and enables the permanent exchange value of the rupee to be fixed now; for fixation in terms of gold, which involves an abnormally high sterling rate during the continuance of the gold premium, provides for the automatic fall in the sterling-rupee exchange as sterling recovers. Thus, when sterling and gold are again identical, die exchange value of the rupee will be 2s., and the adjustment will have been effected without occasion for official intervention.5. It is now desirable to refer to the effect of abandoning the decision to link with gold and to rate the rupee at 2s. sterling, while sterling remains depreciated in termsof gold.10  1413     120  5.20
6. It may be admitted, in the first instance, that by the decision adopted the cost to the British consumer of Indian commodities has been increased, as well as the cost to communities in non-rupee-using countries which rely on India for rice and other necessaries of life. But the Currency Committee had to consider the whole question from the Indian point of view and not from that of a public outside India. They were thus impressed by the weighty evidence of the Government of India and witnesses who came before them, as to the very serious social and economic consequences of the steep rise in the cost of living in India in recent years. It is notorious that actual disturbances have occurred in various parts of the country in consequence of high prices, and, seeing that the rupee had already risen to 2s. Ad. when the Committee reported, it would have been inexplicable if the Committee had failed to fix the rupee so as to secure the alleviating influences of a high exchange. To have linked with sterling in the conditions which prevailed at the close of last year, and still exist, would afford no such guarantee, and in view of the uncertainty still attaching to the future course of sterling---an uncertainty which the advocacy of the views in these papers emphasises to link with sterling at 2s. now would, threaten India with an immediate further rise in prices which might soon be on a formidable scale. The writers of these papers are not correct in suggesting that the new currency policy is thoroughly unpopular in India. Actually the Currency Report received on the whole an extraordinarily favourable reception from the Press, Indian and European, where its sincere devotion to Indians interests was appreciated. In particular, the argument in respect of prices has had great weight with Indian public opinion, and has secured support for the new policy in important quarters which might otherwise have made cause with elements hostile to Government. The unpopularity of the policy to which the writers refer has been developed mainly in Bombay, where it is understood that there has been considerable speculation on a low rate of exchange resulting from the Committee&apos;s deliberations, and interested persons are disappointed to find that they are unable to bring back to India at a low exchange funds that they had laid down in England at high rates. Much of the criticism also centres round certain factors connected with the remittance of funds from India consequent on the introduction of the new policy, to which it is unnecessary to refer in detail here.7. While the economic results of fixing the rupee at 2s. sterling would be very serious, the consequences on the monetary side would be disastrous. For reasons stated in the Committees Report, the introduction of an inconvertible note into India, or the fining clown of the silver content of the rupee, were considered impracticable. The Indian currency problem has therefore to be considered on the assumption that a rupee containing 165 grains fine silver must be maintained. At the present price of silver the bullion value of the rupee is about 2s. 2\&amp;., and before the recent fall in the price of the metal has been as high as 2s. S^d. In these circumstances, with a 2s. sterling rupee the Government of India would have been excluded from the silver market. The prohibition on the export of silver would, as at present, have been maintained, but the currency would have been subjected to leakage by internal melting and the difficulty of enforcing the prohibition. In these circumstances there would have been no means of assuring the convertibility of the note.1Again, as regards gold, it is obvious that the sovereign could not circulate with the rupee fixed at 2s. sterling. Thus the whole burden of metallic currency would, except in respect of subsidiary coinage, have been concentrated on silver, the purchase of which would, as stated above, have not been practicable. The Government of India&apos;s stock of gold would be immobilised as coin, and the problem which is now \ being tackled of making gold an effective element in the circulation, would have been insoluble until sterling had recovered its gold parity.8. So far as India is concerned, the consequences of linking the rupee with sterling at 2s. would thus have threatened the economic stability of the country and the maintenance of a sound currency system.0. It will now be well to turn to what the joint Memorandum calls the &quot; anti-Imperial character &quot; of the present policy of the Government of India. The main grounds for this criticism are understood to be threefold : (1) That by linking the rupee with gold an element of uncertainty, seriously hampering to trade, has been introduced into all the trade relations* Since this was written, there lias been a substantial fall in the sterling as well as tlie gold price of silver which has diminished the risk of the rupee becoming an undervalued coin. Hut so long as the future course of sterling is uncertain, the risk might again become serious if sterling depreciated materially in terms of gold, and the rupee were linked to sterling at 2s.
obetween India on the one side and the United Kingdom and-the greater-part of the Empire on the other, to the advantage of America and Japan, which are on a gold basis.(2) That the strength of India&apos;s export trade, instead of being available to help to redress the British adverse balance - with America, acts to depress British exchange and to increase the burden of the external debt.(3) That cost of Indian commodities in the United Kingdom has been increased by the high level of the rupee.10. As regards (1), the disadvantages attaching to a fluctuating rupee-sterling exchange were appreciated by the Currency Committee, but there were important factors on the other side, to which brief allusion has been made in paragraph 4 above. It is, moreover, understood that in all Indian transactions involving exchange the rate of exchange is fixed at the time of the deal, and the parties concerned are thus able to protect themselves against subsequent fluctuations. The British-Indian trade is in this respect conducted now under precisely the same conditions as the British-American trade, which continues to thrive in spite of exchange difficulties. The Indian Exchange Banks, who had to deal with at least au equally difficult situation when the rupee was on a silver basis, provide trade with a means of safeguarding itself against the risks of exchange ; and though the advantages of stable exchange are obvious to all, current facts prove that exchange fluctuations are no insuperable barrier to the progress of business.11. As regards (2), the authors of the joint Memorandum appear to hold that by the device of a change of currency system the resources of one country may be properly annexed for the support of the exchange of another.   Thus, if the world owes India 20,000,000 . gold in exchange for her exports, she maybe made to accept the equivalent, in paper, arrangements being made for remittance to India which would obviate the despatch of gold in liquidation of her credit balances.    Paper being ex-hypothesi cheaper than gold, the effect of the transaction would be to increase the currency in India, and, as there would be no corresponding increase of goods, to tend to raise prices there.   Until there had been a readjustment of wages and other costs to the higher level of prices, producing classes would benefit to the detriment of the consumer.  : The Indian consumer would thus be brought to an increasing degree under the influences of rising prices, which are proving in this country and elsewhere so serious a danger to the maintenance of the social fabric.   In so far as the depreciation of sterling is contributing to the high level of prices in the United Kingdom, the effect would be to mitigate this particular source of stress by lessening the demand for gold and thus reducing the divergence between gold and paper prices. But it may well be asked whether this would be a sufficient justification for forcing on India a credit instrument in place of gold by which trade balances are normally adjusted.12. Reference has already been made to the effect of the new policy on the&apos;prices &apos;0f articles exported from India to sterling and non-rupee using countries. It can be urged that as a member of the Empire India ought to be prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of a cause higher than her own immediate interests. While in no way denying india&apos;s duty to the Empire, it may be urged in reply that it is a-raatter of Imperial importance that prices in India should be kept at as low a level as possible. This view has received practical recognition during the war .and subsequently. Under- the conditions prevailing in recent years, the world demand for foodstuffs has been so great, that had it not been for Government control, India would have been drained of her supplies by the hunger of wealthier Powers, who are prepared to pay anything for India&apos;s produce. In spite of the great need of Europe for these foodstuffs, it was always recognised that the Government of India were bound to ensure first for the satisfaction of India&apos;s own wants, and export has been controlled with this end in view. High exchange by tending to decrease the export of commodities helps to check the rise in internal prices in India. It equally helps to reduce the growth of taxation, since each rupee goes further, and its higher purchasing power keeps down pro tanto the obligation, already serious, of raising-wages to meet the increased cost of living. It has, indeed, always been recognised that in an oriental country a low cost of living, and a low level of taxation are very important elements in securing a contented population. This need in India was never more urgent from an Imperial point of view than to-day.During the war, India made great sacrifices in the matter of currency for the&apos; .sake of the Empire.   When the rupee exchange tended to rise, no effort was spared to
lcoep it down to its old level of Is, -id., which was only abandoned under the pressure of irresistible influences, The successive rises were delayed as long as possible, and by their action the Indian Government facilitated the purchase on favourable terms of supplies of foodstuffs and Avar materials required for the conduct of the war. Now that the war is over, it has become essential to pursue a currency policy which will protect India from the worst evils of.rising prices, and so long as the recovery of Sterling is delayed, this can only be achieved by linking her currency to gold.13. It is impossible to exaggerate; the importance of the question on the political side. Currency policy in India has hitherto been justified as a policy deliberately conceived in India&apos;s exclusive interest. If the Indian were in a position to ascribe any part of the high cost of living from Avhich he is suffering to the subordination of his currency system to the vagaries of sterling, the British ease for controlling Indian currency policy would have received a blow which would react on the whole of British administration in India. Politicians and economists there realise that, as a country with a large credit balance on trade, India is entitled to, and can afford to have, the best form of monetary system. Gold may be a very imperfect basis of currency, but up *o the present time no better has been devised, and India holds that her currency system should be based on gold, and not on paper I.O.U.s. Any attempt, therefore, to deprive her of the advantages of a system for which she is prepared to pay would create the keenest resentment, and go a long way towards shaking confidence in the good faith of tho British Government.14. These remarks lead to the suggestion whether it is desirable or practicable for India to lit in with an Imperial currency scheme such as is discussed in the joint Memorandum and the connected papers.15. There are important points of difference between the various schemes that have been adumbrated, but in effect they all rest on the introduction for the time beino-, at any rate, of an Imperial inconvertible note issue, based in Mr. Darling&apos;s scheme on Bills of Exchange and on Major Grogan&apos;s scheme, apparently, without the necessity of any backing at all. Mr. Darling&apos;s scheme, which, unlike Major Grogan&apos;s, does not postulate the creation of money without the creation of goods, is free from the worst evils of expansionism. But even he advocates a currency which is cheaper than gold, though with him it is definitely intended for the struggling period of recon-struction. Moreover, he is fully alive to the difficulty of bringing India into the scheme. The doubtful merit of taking Major Grogan as a guide in currency questions is well illustrated by his methods of argument in quoting from the Report of the Indian Currency Committee of 1893 on the subject of Brazil. Major Grogan cites the Committee&apos;s reference to Brazil as a country which has been able to maintain its. paper &quot; at a high and fairly steady exchange although it is absolutely inconvertible &quot; and has been increased by the act of Government out of all proportion to the growth &quot; of population and its foreign trade,&quot; He has chosen to omit the Committee&apos;s comment which immediately follows these words :-&quot; The case, it need hardly be said, is not quoted as a precedent which it is desirable to follow.&quot;10. The proposals discussed in these papers rest on fundamental assumptions of a highly disputable character. As regards the joint Memorandum, the position of the writers is in some respects obscure. India is attacked because her policy is alleged to depress British exchange and increase the burden of the British external debt. At the&apos;same time the writers doubt whether it is desirable to take speedy action to restore the parity of the pound. But there is no inconsistency as regards Major Crogan&apos;s views. Be is a frank advocate of currency inflation, which, in his own words, &quot; may win the race &quot; if it is applied with &quot;judgment.&quot; The attitude of the writers of the joint Memorandum in regard to this important question may be illustrated by the following extract from their note :-&quot; Whether, as a matter of fact, it is desirable to restore our exchanges with America and the metallic standard world too rapidly is another question. Our low exchange in the United Kingdom is, at this moment, acting as a most effective protection to our home industries and as a stimulus to our export trade, and is enabling us to undersell the United States in every market. A low exchange between the British Empire and the outside world would similarly act as a tremendously strong stimulus to inter-Imperial trade and Imperial development and constitute a most effective and politically non-contentious form of Imperial preference. Again, as Major Grogan suggests, a relatively low exchange would make it much easier for the:
British Empire to supply food and raw materials to Europe and help it on its feet. For all these reasons it would probably be desirable, while aiming&apos;at restoring the Empire exchange to the old gold basis eventually, more particularly with a view to paying off our debt to America, not to be. in too great a hurry to make this our immediate object, but to aim at keeping the exchanges well below gold parity for the period of Imperial reconstruction and development immediately ahead of us.&quot;17. The joint Memorandum suggests that a low exchange between the British Empire and the outside world would act as a strong stimulus to inter-Imperial trade, and constitute a most effective and non-contentious form of 1 mperial preference. Is not this a new meaning for the term &quot;inter-Imperial &quot; ? A low Imperial exchange would stimulate exports from the Empire to countries on a gold basis, but, except in so far as the absence of exchange calculations might facilitate business, it is not understood how trade within the Empire would be encouraged by the policy suggested. The contrary appears to be the fact; for the natural tendency would be for the Empire&apos;s produce to flow to those countries, l,e., the gold countries, where the sales would realise a larger sterling equivalent. Moreover, if it is thought that the Empire would gain an immense advantage from a low exchange with gold countries, it is easy to see that these countries would be in a position to take effective counter-action. If, for example, Canada, as suggested, reduces the parity of her dollar to live to the pound sterling, why should not the United States do likewise? Indeed, the fining down of the dollar would be the obvious method by which any attempt to snatch an advantage by juggling with the currency could be counteracted. It would indeed be an amusing spectacle to see the great countries of the world engaged in a competition of depreciation.18. From the passage quoted above the theoretic basis of 1 lie policy advocated becomes clear. The writers belong to a school of economic thought which holds that a falling exchange acts beneficially by reason of the stimulus it gives to the export trade. This theory has always had its advocates, and in times of difficulty the instinct that makes for expansionism in whatever form it is concealed, finds ready advocacy. The arguments on which the theory is based were examined, so tar as India is concerned, in the Herschell Report of i.89o.   Briefly stated, they are as follows :-The tendency of a falling exchange is to stimulate exports, inasmuch as a higher price in the currency of the exporting country is received in respect of the same gold prices in the importing country, while wages and other factors in the cost of production do not increase in the same proportion. Production thus becomes more profitable. Assuming these facts to be true, the Committee held that the effect of each successive fall must be transitory and can continue only until circumstances have brought about the inevitable adjustment. The Committee also held that, even if a falling exchange does stimulate exports, the result is not necessarily to the benefit of the country as a whole, though it may temporarily benefit the employer at the expense of the wage-earner because wages rise more slowly than prices.19. The point of view from which writers, such as Major Grogan, approach this question is one-sided and fails to take into account many factors in a complex social and economic problem. If- a falling exchange is as beneficial as these writers affect to assume, how comes it that the countries of Western Europe are now struggling to-escape from the burden of their depreciated currencies? We may. well ask, on their showing, how it is that Austria, with its krone at ^nd of its normal parity, is not the most prosperous country in Europe? The defects of Major Grogaids analysis of tins problem will be apparent if we examine his statement &quot;that the depreciation of the *l unit of value only acts as a stimulus to production if the relation of debtor to creditor &quot; is maintained constant in terms of the altering unit of value.&quot; In other words, the non-producing classes, such as professional men, and classes on fixed incomes, such as wage-earners, must be content to acquiesce in the receipt of salaries and wages in a depreciated currency to the same nominal value as before the depreciation. Patent facts prove the impossibility of maintaining this condition, and the result is that with every successive depreciation of the unit of value, forces are set in motion which irresistibly compel a revision of fixed salaries and wages. Inflation breeds inflation, and when the slippery path is once entered, the weakness of man finds it difficult to call a halt. Experience, however, shows that in times of currency inflation, contractual relations cannot be kept constant &quot;in terms of the altering unit of value.&quot; The reason is that there is a still more important relation, namely, that between the unit of value and commodities. Thus if there is any material 1413 B
depreciation of the unit of value; a complete readjustment of social relations as based on money follows. The stress is great and the process of adjust-ment painful. But they have apparently no terrors for men like Major Grogan, who are prepared to endure the evils of depreciation for an indefinite period. The logical conclusion to which such writers can be driven is that it is a paying proposition to depreciate the currency, and that when it is once depreciated it would be a blunder to restore its value. Apparently the same sort of view was advocated in certain quarters when, at the time of the Napoleonic wars, the British   was also at a discount in foreign exchange. The observations of the Bullion Committee, which reported on the matter to Parliament at that lime, are as pregnant with significance to-day as they were then: &quot; Your Committee, moreover, beg leave to advert to the temptation to resort to a depreciation even of the value of the gold coin by an alteration of the standard, to which Parliament itself might be subjected by a great and long-continued excess of paper. This has been the resource of many Governments under such circumstances, and is the obvious and most easy remedy to the evil in question. But it is unnecessary to dwell on the breach of public faith and dereliction of a primary duty of Government, which would manifestly be implied in preferring the reduction of the coin down to the standard of the paper, to the restoration of the paper to the legal standard of the coin.&quot;20., It may be well to consider how the Indian would view the incorporation of his country in such a scheme as Major Grogan advocates. The Indian has for generations been accustomed to the use of the precious metals, which play an important part in his religious and social practices. His claims to receive payment for his exports in such form as he desires have recently been reaffirmed by the Indian Currency Committee. Under Major Grogan&apos;s proposals he will be cut off from gold. The Indian currency system, as conducted before the war, has frequently been attacked by Indian politicians and others as precluding India from obtaining the full quantity of gold to which her position as a creditor country entitled her. Hitherto it has been possible to defend the currency policy as worked in the interests of India. Under Major Grogan&apos;s scheme it would have to be urged that deprivation of India of gold was undertaken, not in India&apos;s interests, but in the interests of the United Kingdom,, which was unable to carry the burden of its depreciated currency alone. This would be an entirely novel justification of British Government in India. Parliament has lately sanctioned a large departure in the direction of increasing self-governing institutions in India. It would be a strange contradiction if, within a few months of passing the Government of India Act, the control of Indian currency was to be directed otherwise than for Iudia&apos;s exclusive interests. India has been given a sound currency system, and it has been possible to maintain it on a standard higher than that which the impoverished Governments of Western Europe are at the moment able to afford. If the people of this country attempted to lessen their burdens by harnessing India to the yoke under which they labour, who can doubt that India would feel justified in &quot;bringing forward the charges which even now the more malignant sectioii of the population endeavour to bring against British administration ?There are, moreover, practical difficulties in the way of introducing an Imperial note into India. The language question requires a special issue for India, but, apart from this, all those who have any hand in Indian currency matters are convinced that an inconvertible note would lead to the gravest political and economic conse-quences, and it is obvious that a scheme like Major Grogan&apos;s would drive India to inconvertibility, since, in addition to the denial of gold, a 2s. sterling rupee would render fresh acquisitions of silver impracticable under present conditions.What, moreover, would be the effect of the scheme on the Indian consumer? With the depreciation of his currency his foodstuffs would find more willing purchasers abroad, and he would find himself, harder pressed to maintain existence for the benefit of wealthier populations elsewhere. It would be small comfort to him to be able to say that he was enjoying the privilege of &apos;&apos; a most effective and politically non-contentious form of Imperial preference.&quot; It may well be doubted whether in India the scheme would be non-contentious very long. If a falling exchange benefits the exporters it acts as a tax on all consumers, and the tax in this case would be for the benefit of the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire. The policy would be reminiscent of events that preceded the American W.ar of Independence, and Indians would not be slow to draw the moral.   They would say to this country &quot; It is our
money you want,&quot; and they would be able to add the sting that at the same time we were refusing to admit them freely as fellow citizens of the Empire into the self-governing Dominions.21. Under present conditions India requires a high exchange, and, in order to secure India from grave economic and monetary ills, it is desirable that her exchange should be linked to gold. While there appear to be the gravest objections to regularising inconvertibility throughout the Empire on general grounds, it is clear that India would have strong reason in her own interests for standing apart from any such scheme. When sterling and gold are again identical Tndia&apos;s currency will again be linked with sterling and at a more convenient ratio than formerly. Mean-while, if the choice lies between a policy enhancing prices, promoting economic and political discontent, and increasing entrepreneur profits on the one side, and action tending to stabilise prices, to mitigate the causes of unrest, and to hold fair the balance between employer and employed, India&apos;s course will not be difficult.Financial Department, India Office,26tk April 1921).
