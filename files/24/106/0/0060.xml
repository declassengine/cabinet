SECRET.THE CABINET.SITUATION IN BAVARIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.*I circulate to my colleagues a report received from Majof-General N. Malcolm, 0154 Chief of the British Military Mission, Berlin, of a recent visit to Munich, together with 5260 notes of conversations with a doctor and a coal merchant living at Munich.w. s. c.The War Office,mh May, 1920.Report on a Visit to Munich, 22nd to 26th April, 1920, by Major-GenerAl N. Malcolm, Chief of&apos; the Beitisii Military Mission, Berlin.I left Berlin for Munich on Friday night, 22nd April, and returned to Berlin on the morning of 27th April. The time at my disposal did riot enable me to do more than to study the Bavarian situation as it presented itself to me in the capital; but was sufficient, to force me to come back to Berlin iri a very pessimistic state of mind. Nowhere in Germany have I found class feeling running so high ; nowhere have I felt so hopeless of finding a peaceful solution of the social problems. For various reasons I was unable to see any members of the Independent or Communist parties, but I had extremely interesting interviews with the Minister President, Herr von Eahr, and with Herr Timm, the Leader of the Majority Socialists^ as well as with merchants and other people.Everywhere I found that the one subject of real interest was the threatened disarmament of the Einwohnerihehr. In comparison with this all absorbing subject, even Prussian misrule, Dr. Heim&apos;s campaign of independence, and the&apos; French occupation of Frankfurt sank into insignificance.&apos;The reason is not far to seekv but it dbes not help us to find a remedy. On 7th November, 1918, Kurt Eisner raised the Red Flag at the foot of the statue of Bavaria; in February he was.shot in the streets by young Count Arco; in May,&apos; Saxon and Prussian troops restored Gonstitutioiial Government in the Bavarian Capital. The memory of those months of misrule will hot be easily forgotten, for it was misrule established against the wish of the majority arid maintained by violence without intelligence. This is the explanation of the bitter class hatred which exists in Bavaria to-day. To prevent a return of this experience the Eihwohnerwekr were established and organized, and it is due to them that Bavaria remained quiet throughout the &quot; Kappiade.&quot; It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that the order to disarm them has arousecl such strong opposition; notwithstanding the fact that their existence is a clear and distinct infringement of the peace Treaty.Two aspects of the. present situation must be considered; First, that ode section of the population, certainly the wealthiest and best educated j and perhaps the most numerous, is firmly convinced that the preservation of all that makes life worth living depends upon its power of self defence. Secondly; that in the face of this conviction no Government will: be strong enough to carry out disarmament. A Government which cannot arrest Erhardt or disarm the Marine brigades certainly cannot disarm the peasants of Bavaria. In this connection it is worth noting that Colonel Morene; art able and distinguished French officer who is at the head of the &quot; effectives &quot; branch of the Commission of Control in Munich, was under no delusion as to the difficulty of carrying out his task.   While fully imbued with the French view that the existence(B20/257)  100 6/20  H&amp;S 8257wo
of so many armed men would sooner or later be a menace to his own country he was equally alive to, and not without sympathy for, the reasons for their existence, His general view was, I think, that while they could not be abolished, at least for the present, they could and should be reduced in numbers and controlled.Estimates as to the numbers of Einwohnerwehr are very varying. Dr. Echerich, who is at the head of the organization, gave me to understand that while they had about 109,000 men in proper formations he thought they actually possessed 150,000 to 100,000 rifles. Another estimate placed the number at about 220,000, while Colonel Morene put it at 450,000, a figure which is almost certainly an exaggeration.Whatever the correct figure may be, the basis of this organization is political, as is only to be expected seeing the causes from which it has sprung. Enlistment is purely voluntary, but acceptance is dependent upon a committee of selection approved by the Government.   Nominally at least th3 only tests are that the candidate (a.) Is in favour of the maintenance of law and order.(b.) Guarantees to stand behind the Constitutional Government.This second test, it is claimed, excludes all known reactionaries as well as members of the Independent Socialist and Communist parties, to which about 50 per cent, of the male trade unionists of Munich now belong. In answer to a question arising out of this point, Herr Timm informed me that in big works employing both Majority and Independent Socialists the practice was that men of neither party joined the Einwohnerwehr.We- thus arrive at a most regrettable situation in which the possessing parties, excluding a few reactionaries and including most of the peasants and a certain number of working men, are banded together to protect themselves against the mass of the working population. These in turn have a certain number of arms, estimated as high as 40,000, but probably not so many, and almost without ammunition.The difficult)&apos;&apos; of the situation thus produced is evident. It amounts to something resembling a state of suspended civil war. It received its clearest expression from Kriebel, the chief staff officer for the Einwohnerwehr, who described it exactly as though the question were purely military with the working classes as &quot; the enemy.&quot; He mentioned certain places as being &quot; dangerous areas &quot; particularly Nuremburg, Augsburg and the north-east corner of the State. He explained how in these areas it was necessary to be most particular in the selection of &quot; reliable &quot; men, and how he was now engaged upon a scheme for entirely surrounding these industrial areas and cutting off their supplies by isolating them from the neighbouring country. This work was being pressed on with all speed as, in his opinion, another outbreak might occur almost at any moment. I put it to him that a situation such as this, which was practically one of civil war, could not continue indefinitelv without involving the country in ruin. To this he replied that he was quite of my opinion but before any modus vivendi could be reached it would be necessary sooner or later to eliminate the revolutionary elements.Major Kriebel, like many other people, considered that the extremists of the Left were only waiting for the disarmament of the Einwohnerwehr before starting a fresh revolution ; of this he claimed to have documentary proof, but could not show me any.Such is the situation with which the Entente is faced in Bavaria, and I venture to think that it will require most careful handling. In the present state of feeling, a direct order for the disarmament of the Einwohnerwehr will probably have no effect whatever. It would then be a question of how to enforce the order. A blockade would be ineffective as it would increase the want among the unarmed workmen while its effect among the wealthier classes and the peasants would be much less. The only other possible action would appear to be an occupation by Entente troops which could carry out the disarmament of the Einwohnerwehr and at the same time keep order among the working classes. To this action the objections are many and obvious and I would suggest that there is another possible course open.In all these problems in Germany it is to be remembered that the root of the evil is in want of food and work; the mass of the people wants to work, they cannot do so partly because they are underfed, partly because raw material and coal are both lacking. Moreover, want of food affects all classes of society and is responsible for the highly strung and nervous condition which is so noticeable in almost every German one meets, especially in Berlin. Class hatred is again only one phase of this nervous State. 1 would, therefore, suggest that in dealing with the food problem the Entente will also be dealing with the Einwohnerwehr problem, for when the people are fed and able to work the need for the &apos;&apos; Civic Guard&quot; will vanish. This, of course, will take time, and therefore time for disbandment should be allowed.   In return the Entente should
(A).Notes on a Conversation with Dr. Leonhard, Munich, 26th April, 1920.1. Dr. Leonhard is a Bavarian and an Academical man, but is financially interested in lignite quarries in the Austrian Tyrol, more especially one near Kufstein.2. Asked what form of Government had been adopted in the Tyrol, Dr. Leonhard said that the province was governed by a Landesregierung, or provincial Government affiliated to Vienna.3. Dr. Leonhard, being a Bavarian, was of course in favour of the movement in the Tyrol towards a union with Bavaria. There were two conflicting elements in the Tyrol, he said, with regard to this question. The big Jew capitalists in Vienna were of course against such a move, as they would thereby lose a profitable source of income. The people, however, without any regard to political views, were in favour of it owing to the terrible food shortage from which they are suffering at present.4. With regard to the food question, the doctor stated that the country was being systematically emptied by Austrian and Italian Jews.. (It may be mentioned in this respect that the doctor held anti-Semitic views.) None of the food imported from abroad reaches the Tyrol. There is hardly any coal for use inside the province, and the forests are disappearing to provide wood for Vienna.- 5. The staple articles of food are worse in the Tyrol than in Vienna, and are more expensive than in Bavaria, e.g., 1 kilogramme potatoes costs 8 kronen, 1 kilogramme beef costs 120 kronen. The bread is worse than it is anywhere else in Central Europe. Many cases of sickness have been, recorded amongst those who have had to eat it  being unable to obtain anything else. Food may be bought, however, by those who can afford to spend large sums of money.6. All political parties are, in view of these conditions, united in their wish to join Bavaria.7. On the question of Bavarian secession, Herr Leonhard said that in Bavaria the Christian Socialist party and Socialists were probably in favour of a separation from the rest of Germany. The German National party and members of the &quot; Right &quot; were of course against a move. Herr Leonhard was not able to discuss this question with any assurance, as he does not mix in political matters.8. Speaking of the Braunkohl (lignite) industry, in which he was interested, the doctor stated that production had very much decreased, in the same way as it has decreased all over Germany and Austria. Lignite is easier to quarry than coal, yet the 350 workmen in the business in question only produce now at the rate of 40,000 tons per year. &apos;5 tons per man per day is considered very good now. The inefficiency of the workmen, he said, was largely due to underfeeding.R, V. Hume, 1 Lieutenant,Royal Artillery.29th April, 1920.(8257)/demand, first, that the numbers of the Eimvohnerwehr should be strictly limited, and, secondly, that it should put &quot;its own trained staff officers (into any office it pleases. That is to say that in return for certain considerations the Entente should demand really effective control as it has every right to do. The role of these staff officers would in many cases be difficult, but it would not be impossible.In conclusion 1. would point out that this suggestion applies only, to Bavaria, but I think it might with advantage be extended to other parts of Germany.I attach herewith two papers by Lieutenant R. V. Hume, R.A. : (A.) Notes on a conversation with Dr. Leonhard, who has financial interests in Tyrol,(B.) Notes on a conversation with Herr Max East, a prominent coal merchant.M. MALCOLM, Major-General,Chief of the British Military Mission,1. Moltkestrasse, Berlin.
(B.)Notes on an Interview with Here East, a prominent Coal Merchantin Bavaria.Munich,26th April, 1920.1. Herr East stated that the coal situation in Bavaria was very bad. No coal could be issued for private use for March and April of this year. Small stocks were being released now for this purpose, but these stocks represented the supply which should have been issued to private consumers in February.2. Asked how hotels and other public institutions managed to keep electric light burning, he said in Munich itself all electricity was supplied by water power (River Isar).   When the river was low the electric train service had to be cut down.3. With regard to the price of coal in Germany, Herr Rast stated that whereas German coal was sold at an artificially low price (t.e., M.2,500 for 10 tons), imported coal could only be obtained at over ten times that number of marks (e.g., American coal now costs M.37,000 per 10 tons). In consequence of these artificially restricted prices for German coal, much profiteering was going on on the Dutch frontier, where German coal from the Ruhr was being imported into Holland and re-exported to Germany by the Dutch as American coal.4. On the question of Bavaria&apos;s requirements of coal, Herr Rast stated that, in 1913, 8 million tons of coal were consumed in the State, including imported coal and German coal from Bohemia, Saxony and Bavaria. The requirements of Bavaria to-day are, therefore, at least 8 million tons per annum. The amount actually delivered now. is between 1\ and 3 million tons of bad German coal. Almost the entire supply, therefore, has to be issued under the strictest supervision to the essential industries only. The shortage was of course largely due to cessation of supplies from the Ruhr mines,5. Owing to the introduction of the 61- hour working day in the coal mines 33 per cent; more workers have been engaged. Nevertheless, production has decreased by 33 per cent, as compared with pre-war figures. At the Pensburg and Peissenburg mines in Bavaria the average daily production of a miner has recently sunk from &quot;8 tons to &quot;4 tons.6. The quality of the coal has deteriorated considerably, too, owing to the laziness and inefficiency of the miners. Whereas for Ruhr coal the accepted standard of calories per kilogramme before the war was 7,000, the most heat produced per kilo-gramme now is 3,500. The coal is small and dusty and is, of course, burned very quickly and wastefully.7. Herr Rast stated that in his own depots he calculated on a daily theft of between 3 per cent, and 5 per cent, of the coal lying there. He said that peat and wood were so expensive, and of such inferior quality, that the poorer classes were very easily temptedi to steal where they had an opportunity of obtaining coal.8., An experiment had been tried he said whereby, in order to relieve the fuel situation of the small householder, large numbers of the unemployed were sent out into the woods round Munich to cut trees for fuel. This experiment was very unsuccessful as the labour was so expensive and inefficient that the wood could only be sold at from two to three times its normal price.9. With regard to the unemployment question, Herr Rast stated that although the number of unemployed had recently been considerably reduced, yet in the near future it would assume alarming proportions. Owing to the height of wages it has. been found impossible by many factory and mine owners to maintain the large numbers of workmen they are employing at present. The dismissal of these workmen, which is practically inevitable, will result in further unrest all over the country.10. To-day, he said, his workmen in nurnberg had demanded an increase of wages to M. 230 per week. In Bavaria miners were at present demanding increases which if granted would amount altogether to roughly 40 million marks per annum.
29th April, 1920.R. V. Hume, Lieutenant,Royal Artillery.11. In conclusion, Herr Rast said that the acute conditions mentioned above had compelled the coal merchants in Bavaria to resort to measures which were not strictly legal in order to obtain further supplies. Trainloads of coal were being smuggled into the country from Silesia. At the present moment one of these was on its way from that Province to Munich. This coal had been obtained by and would be sold by Schleichhandel, ie., at non-control prices. From what Herr Rast stated it seemed that that the coal had been smuggled out of Silesia without attracting the notice of the Control Authorities there. When such things occur he said very little further proof is required of the bad economic condition of the country.
