[This Document Is the Property of His Britannic MaJesty&apos;s Government,&apos;and should      J 7 1 be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]NEGOTIATIONS &quot;WITH M. ^KHASSIN fj -HOTE.BY JjOHP, CTJRZOt.As M4 Krassin is at last here, and we are in a position to deal with a member of the Soviet Executive, it seems desirable that vre should seize the opportunity of coming to some understanding concerning the many points on which the Soviet Government and ourselves are at issue in different parts of Europe and the East 0w&quot;e know from a great variety of sources that the Russian Government is threatened with complete economic disaster, and that it is ready to pay e/imort any price for the assistance which to      more than any one else      are in a position to give. We can hardly contemplate coming to its rescue without exacting our&apos;own price for it, and it seems to mo tfcat that price can iXv better be paid in a cessation of Bolshevik hostility in parts of the world of importance to us, than in the ostensible interchange of commodities, the existence of which on any considerable scale in Russia there is grave reason to doubt, further there are certain respects, e ,g. prisoners, in which the Soviet authorities have either been guilty of a breach of faith or are behaving in a manner which renders friendly negotiation with them very difficult.(A) . I will deal first with the question of british prisoners or &quot;detenus&quot; .   These fall under the following main categories(l). Civilians - actually imprisoned in Moscow,Petrograd, and Vologda, of whom there are known to be twenty, and may be more.   It is quite possible that I, Lit vino ff might contend that some of these belong to the class of &quot;persons imprisoned for grave offences&quot;, who, by an unpardonableand/
and unauthorised act of weakness, were excluded by Mr, 0*Grady from the terms of Ms Agreement6   But, he that as It may, their Immediate repatriation should now he required*(2)., Other British civilians who have nox yet left Russia, hut desire tc do so. and of whom a certain numbey have been refused the necessary facilities,(3). British prisoners of war in Siberia, (Colonel Johnston and his party) c   These were covered by the 01 Grady Agreement f but, although we were informed by MnLitvinoff that steps were being taken to move them to Moscow with a view to repatriation, we have not been able to ascertain what has happned to them. Information has just reached us from an escaped Bane that there are 150 of-these at Irkutsk, They could be repatriated via Vladivostock, If there are difficulties via Moscow,,   There are also certain British civilians in Siberia who wish to be sent to the United Kingdom.(4)   Captain Frecheville and Lieutenant Couche, captured by the Soviet Government about January 8,1920, at Rostov. The Soviet Government has so far &quot;been unable to give any information and states that the story of cheir capture and reported death must be a counter-revolutionary invention.   If they cannot be produced and no information is available, it is evident that the story of their murder, which was a very atrocious one-, is true.(5)   British Naval personnel recently captured &quot;at Baku, and said to be employed upon menial service by the Soviet authorities that-? The immediate repatriation of these officers and ratings (who are outside the 01Grady Agreement ) should be demanded.   They can be sent via Batoum or elsewhere in the Caucasus, and there is no need for them********* rto travel via Moscow0   It is believed that there may also be British civilians captured when Baku was taken by the Bolsheviks,If the Soviet Government should contend that there are still Russian prisoners whom we have failed to repatriate under the0rGrady
rt   3   w0&apos;Grady Agreement, we can say&apos; in reply that we have already returned ail the -Bolshevik prisoners of war who were in England; that we have provided shipping for the Russian prisoners in Denmark and Switzerland (who have already been repatriated);    that efforts are being made to ausist the Belgian Government in sending back the Russians from Belgium; that enquiries are being made in India and Egypt about various Russians who are alleged by Me Litvinoff to be awaiting repatriation;    and that we are perfectly willing to repatriate all Russian civilians in the United Kingdom who wish to return to Soviet Russia, but that so far M. LitvinoffJhas given us no lists of their names and. has indeed claimed, contrary to the usual practice, the right to differentiate between Russians and Russians * ,;     (B) .     I pass to the cases in which the Bolsheviks are either openly at war with peoples or States in whom we are concerned, or are engaged in propaganda, plots, and alliances directed against British interests or the British Empire in the East 9The first of these cases is Afghanistan,   Bolshevik Missions have been for many months in Kabul, the principal delegates being Bravin and now Suvitz;    and Tire have the terras of the Treaty which has been discussed between the two parties, accompanied no doubt by a good deal of chicane and bluff on both sides;   but avowedly directed at the arming and insurrection of the frontier tribes along the entire north-west frontier of India, and the subversion of British dominion the rev   From unimpeachable sources we have been able to follow the course of these negotiations; and it is significant that only in the past few weeks (as the Mussoorie conversations with the Mir have showed signs of breaking down) we have&apos;certain knowledge that, &quot;by orders of the Soviet Government, thoy have been resumed.   As recently as May 22nd the Yiceroytelegraphed/
telegraphed suggesting that the projected Soviet-Afghan Agreement might he forestalled &quot;by an Agreement of our own with the Soviet Government.   This ia exactly on the lines of the negotiations that I now suggest.   I think that, whether by formal Agreement or otherwise, the Soviets should realise that friendly negotiations with us are incompatible with a policy of Alliance with Afghanistan openly directed against the British position in India,The second case is Persia,   I need not recapitulate the facts, with, which the Cabinet is familiar.  Y/hether the Soviet forceB at Enzeli are a hostile and aggressive force or not, the Soviet Government should realise that we cannot acquiesce in a Soviet invasion of Persia, with which we have entered into a formal Agreement, and which is excluded from the range of Soviet ambitions by the explicit declarations published to the world by Chicherin.The third case is the Caucasus,   We have no objection to the Soviet authorities recognising the independence of the Caucasian States.   But we cannot tolerate the spectacle of Soviet armies marching to the attack of places held by British or Allied garrisons (e,g, Batoum);   and our Naval forces have been deliberately-instructed to oppose, as they have opposed, any such advance,  We are, however, quite willing to countermand these orders as soon as the Soviet authorities countermand their attack.The fourth case is that of Wrangelrs force in the Crimea, Here we have more nearly come to an agreement with the Soviet Government than in any other quarter.   In spite of the fact that we have been strongly pressed to lend assistance to that force in its threatened advance outside the Crimea - an assistance which would easily convert it into a very powerful weapon of offence against the Soviet in Southern Russia -- we have adhered to ourresolve/
V. :   5     Mresolve to &quot;bring hostilities in that region to a close as soon as possible.   Chicherin has ^accepted our proposals for negotiations on the basis of a general amnesty,   British military and political officers to take pa,rt in these proceedings; and we are now only awaiting information as to time and place.In all these charters there exist the materials for a reasonable arrangement with the Soviet authorities,   I suggest that such an arrangement be treated as an essential condition of the negotiations with M. Krassin and his Colleagues which it is proposed to initiate,CURZON Of KEDLESOT.FOREIGN&quot; OFFICE. 27 MAY 1920.
