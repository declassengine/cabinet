01711- SERVICE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS, 1The first general decision on this topic was taken the Cabinet in 1917 and embodied in paragraph 4 of Treasuryroular of the 10th February, 1917 (4738/17), as follows; TTA few cases have been, brought to Their lordships notice of Civil Servants who have obtained exemption from military service on the ground of conscientious objections. It should be noted that unless- they are members of the Non.Combatant Corps, drawing pay as such from Army Funds, such Civil Servants are not entitled *foo benefit by the &quot; Treasury Circulars,     If they are exempted by tribunals on. condition that they - .. undertako&apos; work of national-importance they are to be regarded as on civil leave from their Department without pay,   No remuneration is payable by their Department and the period of their absence will not count for increment or pensions   It would appear tha in certain instances tribunals have agreed that service in their former Department shall be regarded as work of National Importance,   in Their lordships opinion it Is open to the Head of any. Department to refuse his assent to such an arrangement, the fact that the men have been released indicating that they are not indispensable0   If, however, they are allowed to remain, the above ruling will apply as far as possible.   Their service will not count for pension or increment and their remuneration will be either their former actual rate of remuneration (without increments) or the rate which would be paid to a temporary substitute&quot;performing the duties whichever is less.   In cases of doubt arising under this paragraph, reference should be made to thi s DepartrnentTr 02tt   On the conclusion of the Armistice in November 1918Departments
1 (j uDepartments &quot;began to raise the question of the reinstatement of Civil Service Conscientious Objectors but no action was considered necessary until,, in the Summer of 1919, the Homo Office released the men employed on work of national importance.. The matter was then exhaustively considered by the Home Affairs Committee of the tfar Cabinet j who decided on August 1st last (how:,Co36th Minutes)fi]    That the following classes of Civil Service Conscientious Objectors should for the present be employed on tho basis&quot; approved by the War Cabinet in 1917, i.e. that they should receive their former rate of pay without any increase, or the rate of pay for a temporary employee doing the same work, whichever was less, and their period of service in that capacity should not count for increment or pension in the permanent posts:-(a) The Civil Servants who were granted absolute exemption by their tribunals.(b) Those who wore granted conditional exemption by their tribunals,&quot; but were allowed to continue working in their own Departments.(c) Those who were granted exemption by their tribunals m condition that they took up work of national importance elsewhere than in their Department.(d) Men who were passed by the Central Tribunal, and who worked satisfactorily under the Brace Committee.(ii) That the following classes of Civil Service Conscientious Objectors should not be reinstated at present;(a) Men who were passed by the Central Tribunal and undertook work under t.be Brace Committee, but behaved badly or creke tho oend 1 i-ions, of release and had to be recalled to prison or the Army. &apos;(b) Men who applied to the Central Tribunal,, but were turned down by it as net being genrmne-jy conscientious to their objection to military service.(c) Men who refused to apply to the Central Tribunal or having been passed by that Tribunal, refused to accept work under the Brace Committee *   &quot;
hi i(ill)        That the que tit ion of the reinstatement of any particular Civil Service Conscientious Objector should be left to the discretion of the Head of the Department concerned.(iv)        Thv.t the question of complete reinstatement should for the present be left open.   Under a previous decision of the 19th June, the Committee had decided that &quot;men who either refused or 7/ere not ellowed to take up work under the H.O. Committee, and continued to serve their sentence;;&quot; who had been dismissed from the service - should not be re-employed.3.   In coming to this decision the Committee ve-re influ-experienced by the fact that demobilisation of Civil Servants v.-as still proceeding; that numbers of discharged soldiers and sailors were seeking employment; and that in1 general public opinion was not ripe for more than the measures outlined above.4.   It is felt that the time has now come when the position could be further considered and if possible a final solution found.The men in question fall roughly into two classes (i)   Men who may- &amp;t the discretion of the Heads of Departments, be reinstated on conditions applicable to temporary-employees .   Of these some have been taken back, others not. (ii)   Men who may under no circumstances be reinstated for the present.5.   Taking first (ii).   Hesolutions have been received from various Trade Unions and Civil Service Associations that all Conscientious.Objectors should be fully reinstated.   It is submitted that no case exists for reversing the decision already given in regard to men in this category.
i    0I  (:J  0It may be argued that it is precisely the men in Class (ii) - particularly the &quot;Absolutists&quot; who resist any form of State control - who are the most genuinely conscientious. This may or may not be- so; but it is felt that the question of employing them in the Civil Service must be decided on other considerations; and that such men have proved that they are unfitted to form part of the Civil Service which nas at least on occasion to perform duties shading off into those of tin Forces of the Crown.Again it might be suggested that it would be safe to leave the question of re-employing these men to Heads of Departments at their discretion.   But it is felt that the position of Heads of Departments would be made very difficult, and that any consistent jolicy as between Departments would be impossible.   Accordingly, it is recommended that the men in this class should now definitely be discharged from the Service.6. As regards (i) - the men who may be reinstated - it is submitted that a definite decision should now be given in each case whether or not the men in these categories should be employed; and where the decision is in the negative, the men should be definitely dismissed.7. In cases where it is decided that such men should be re-employed:, it is thought that the terms of their employment might now be varied and that as from the 1st April, 1920 (or date of re-employment, if later) they should be restored to full established privileges; and that they should be allowed to count service on any kind of work of national importance up to the date of reinstatement for increment but not for pension.8. It is felt that this proposal as regards the reinstated men is no Monger open to objection, in view of the advanced
advanced stage of demobilisation.   The grading of permanent    120 Civil Servants as temporary employees was never easy to defond, and the stop now proposed really follows on the decision that the nen might be re-employed.   Kith the release of the men engaged on work of national importance outside their Departments, it is no longer necessary to secure that those who remain in their Departments should not have too easy conditions of exemption.9U     It is possible that Departments may be unwilling, for one reason or another, to reinstate Conscientious Objectors.   In such cases it is considered that the Plead of the Department should forward to the Treasury a statement of the grounds en which he thinks it necessary to disallow reinstatement and that before such cases are finally disposed of, they should be submitted to the decision of a Central Authority appointed by the Cabinet.   It night well be that if the question oi reinstatement were left wholly to the -disere-tion of individual..Heads of Departments., it wrvuld&quot;&apos;be-impossible to ensur e equality - of treatment.10.   Certain of the men eligible-for.....re-enpJ.oyment-but not re-employed, are not on the: books ofparticular Departments but are on a general list of the Civil ServiceVCommission.   Examples are Boy Clerks whsS have qualifiedn\for Assistant Clerkships, and Second Division Clerks on temporary service.   It is suggested that these nay now be replaced on the general list by the Civil Service^Commissioners and that if the Central Authority referred to above decides that they should be employed, they should be assigned to Departments in the nornal course,11,     On the 9th July, 1918 the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave an assurance on behalf of the Government that&quot;Conscientious
1 $ft io \J&quot;^Conscientious Objectors who are employed in the Ci^il Service and who ha^e refused to  ser^e in the Army, shall not be pro-rioted o^er the heads of Ci^il Servants who ha&quot; a served or are serving in the Army *11   Departments might be reminded of this pledge,, which was notified, to them In Treasury Circular of the 20th July, 1918 (87484/18J.   It is, however, assumed that for this purpose a senior officer who is definitely regarded as unfitted for promotion need not be a bar to the promotion of a Conscientious Objector.
