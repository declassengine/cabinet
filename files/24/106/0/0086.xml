I   ilrT12&apos;7Petition-on &quot;Official Statistics&quot;,Memorandum by the President of the Baard of TradafProviding it is agreed that a Consultative Committee should be constituted of the Chief officers engaged in statistical work in the various Departments (one of their duties being to discuss-s with representatives of the petitioners the petition on official statistics reoently presented to the Government),    I see no objection to referring the question of the instructions,under whioh it is to work to the small Committee recently appointed by the Cabinet to consider cognate questions arising out of the Report of the Imperial Statistical Conference, as Dr. Addison suggests in his memorandum (CP. 1283) of May 14th.    I may reniind the Cabinet that the report forwarded by me with a covering note on May 4&quot;$fci was made, on a referenoe from the Cabinet, by a comprehensive committee of statistical ef fibers, which^comprised the smaller committee mentioned by Drt Addison.    Sither persona^ or by deputy, six out of the seven members of the smaller cemmittee took part in the preparation of the memorandum, but if the proposal to set up such a Consultative Committee is approved by the Cabinet, I agree that the small Committee mentioned by Dr., Addison might suitably consult with the several Department with a view to arriving at an agreed draft of the instructions to* the Consultative committee.   However, as there has been long delay (the petition being dated November 1st 1919), I suggest that the Representatives of the petitioners be at once receivedf informed of the appointment of the consultative committee and invited to discuss with them the points raised in the petition.R.S.Horne,2.6.20.Board of Trade..
