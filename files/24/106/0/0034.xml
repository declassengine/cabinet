4u ^rL,,.iThis document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, iiioSECRET.THE CABINET.THE SITUATION IN POLAND.01499413I circulate for the information of my colleagues a Note which has been prepared by the General Staff on the Situation in Poland.w. s. c.The War Office,21 si May, 1920.The difficulties of Poland in dealing with a Government like the Soviet - Government of Russia should not be underrated. The same difficulties have been experienced by every other country which is in direct contact with Bolshevik Russia. In no case has anything like a satisfactory peace been arranged by such countries with Soviet Russia. The Bolsheviks do not work only by military operations, but, simultaneously or alternatively with these, they employ every device of propaganda in their neighbours&apos; territories to make the soldiers mutiny against their officers, to raise the poor against the bourgeois, to raise the workmen against the employers, to raise the peasants against the land-owners, to paralyse the country by general strikes, and, generally, to destroy every existing form of social order and of &apos; Democratic Government. Thus a state of so-called peace, i.e., a suspension of actual fighting with firearms, may simply mean that the war proceeds in a still more difficult and dangerous form, viz., instead of being attacked by soldiers on the frontier, the country is poisoned internally, and every good and Democratic institution which it possesses is undermined. For a country like Poland, newly constituted, struggling to get on its feet on being liberated after over a century of foreign oppression, whose finances are in disorder, and whose resources are so greatly impoverished by the horrors of the war, this second form of attack is particularly dangerous.The Bolsheviks, however, while loudly professing a desire for peace, have since the end of last year, been preparing for an offensive on the Polish front.In addition to a steady flow of reinforcements toward thes Polish front, there were numerous indications of an impending attack by the Bolsheviks. The approximate strength of the Bolshevik armies on the Western front increased from 81,200 in January, 1920, to 99,200 in early March, and to 133,600 by mid-April. These figures are rifles and sabres, i.e., effective fighting strength. The downfall of Denikin liberated a large number of troops. Many statements have been made by Bolshevik leaders to the effect that they would deal with Poland as they have dealt with Denikin and Kolchak, and great anxiety was felt by Poland during the winter as to what the fate of Poland would be if exposed to such an attack.There is no doubt that the Bolsheviks hoped that, what with their propaganda and their reinforced front, they would be able to beat the Polish troops and overthrow the Government behind them, and, if so, a most difficult situation would have arisen. The reactionary Germans would, of course, be delighted to see the downfall of Poland at the hands of the Bolsheviks, for they fully understand that a strong Poland standing between Russia and Germany is the one thing that will baulk their plans for reconstruction and for revenge.IAbout two months ago (on the 5th March) the Bolshevik offensive against the Poles begant the main weight of this attack being between the Pripyat and the Dneister, a front of 250 miles It then, however, became apparent that the Polish Army, although ill-supplied and ill-clothed, was, nevertheless, imbued with a strong patriotic spirit. The Bolshevik attack never made any real progress, in spite of being repeatedly renewed during the rest of the month. The - Bolsheviks then initiated discussions regarding the opening of peace negotiations, and invited the Polish Government to indicate the time and place for such negotiations.(B20/247)   100  5/20  1I&amp;s  8246wo
The Poles offered Borisov, a place a short distance within their lines, and suggested 10th April as a suitable date, at the same time expressing their readiness to order a cessation of hostilities on that portion of the front. The Poles, also, guaranteed that their Army would abstain from offensive action during the negotiations. The Bolsheviks, however, rejected the Polish proposals, and demanded an armistice on the whole front, and the selection of a place either in the interior of Poland or in a neutral or Allied country for negotiations.In the meanwhile, fresh Bolshevik reinforcements were being concentrated on the Polish front, and there was every indication that the offensive against the Poles was about to be renewed. The Poles, therefore, naturally assumed that the Soviet Government was only procrastinating-, and was endeavouring to create a delay in which to undermine the moral of the Polish troops and population by propaganda, while preparing for the renewed offensive.The Polish Government, under Marshal Pilsudski, a former revolutionary against the (Jzarist regime, of course understand very intimately the Russian political situation, and have shown a profound knowledge of how to tranquilize Russian territory which they are temporarily administering. Their desire is believed to be to have some sort of buffer between them and Bolshevik Russia, at any rate over a portion of their front. Such a buffer state would be constituted by an independent Ukraine.The Polish Foreign Office, on the 27th April, issued a communique&apos; to the effect that Poland acknowledged the right of the Ukraine to independence, and recognized Petliura&apos;s Government. Marshal Pilsudski, on the same day, issued a declaration in which he stated that the Polish Army would co-operate with Ukrainian forces, and would only remain in Ukrainian territory long enough to enable the Ukrainian Government to be established. When this government had been established the Polish troops, he said, would withdraw.Petliura also published a declaration on that day urging the Ukrainian people to do all in their power to fascilitate the operations of the Polish and Ukrainian forces.General Denikin was, of course, entirely opposed either to a strong Poland or to an independent Ukraine, his idea, to which he was always true, being a united Russia on pre-war lines, although willing to recognize a Polish State, the boundaries of which were to be settled by negotiations sanctioned by the Constituent Assembly. With his disappearance, the Ukrainians, under Petliura, have driven the Bolsheviks out of a large part of their territory, and are making an effort to establish an independent Ukraine free from Bolsheviks. Simultaneously with the Polish-Ukrainian advance great popular risings occurred in the Ukraine against the Bolsheviks, and the liberating forces were shown every sign of welcome. Incidentally one Ukrainian-Galician division (impressed by the Bolsheviks for service with the Red Army) laid down their arms and refused to fight against the Polish-Ukrainian forces.There could be no greater advantage to the famine areas of central Europe than the re-establishment of a peaceful state of the Ukraine on the basis which permitted economic and commercial transactions to take phxce. It is there in the TTkraine, and not in the starving regions of Russia, reduced to destitution under Bolshevik rule that an addition to the food supply may be hoped for.It is not possible to say yet what the outcome will be. The Bolsheviks will no doubt make an effort to overwhelm the Poles, and they will certainly get any assistance from the reactionary Germans which can be given unofficially. It will be very difficult for the Ukrainians to establish order in their own country. But on the assumption that Petliura&apos;s Government manages to set up and maintain a separate Government of a civilized type capable of liberating the corn supplies of the Ukraine, and that with that territory sheltered and assisted in this task by a strong Poland, it ought not to be impossible to arrive at satisfactory conditions of a general peace in the east in the course of the present summer. If, on the other hand, Poland succumbs to Bolshevik attacks and the Ukraine is again overrun, the anarchy and disorder destroying all productive capacity which invariably accompanies the establishment of the Soviet regime will prevent all effective export of grain from the Ukraine, and the downfall of Poland will directly involve the vital interests of France, and, in a lesser degree, of Great Britain; it will, moreover, materially further the designs for reconstruction on imperialistic lines which the reactionary elements in Germany desire.
