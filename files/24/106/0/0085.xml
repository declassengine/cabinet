Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers, stated that the Government were entirely in sympathy with the object for which the deputation asked concessions, and that as soon as it was practicable to do so the Government would try and arrange that facilities should be organized for that purpose (CP. 1105). Attention was drawn in my Memorandum of 12th April (CP. 1070), to the administrative difficulties and the expense that would have confronted the War Office if that department were to be charged with the organization of the facilities contemplated.There are, however, already in existence actual organizations for facilitating visits to graves in France and Flanders; the Y.M.C.A., the Church Army and other similar organizations are in fact conducting tours on a large scale for this purpose. All that is required is assistance to reduce the cost so as to bring it within the means of the majority of the relatives concerned.The Y.M.C.A., for example, have a scheme under which a visit is arranged at an inclusive charge ; the latter, though moderate, is beyond the means of a large majority. Two-thirds of the total charge are due to railway charges and ll. to passport charges, and hitherto the Y.M.CA. have been unable to obtain any concessions regarding these items.The Y.M.CA. have their own hostels on the spot run by voluntary workers, and as the latter gain in working experience there should be a proportionate reduction in the charge in respect of board and lodging.If the railways were to grant a reduction of fares for such journeys organized by the Y.M.C.A. and other such institutions, there would appear to be no reason why they could not organize visits at an inclusive cost within the reach of all but the very poor, and these it is understood the Y.M.CA. will help either wholly or in part.As the expense due to railways and passports form such a high proportion of the total cost of the visits that are being organized now, I consider that steps should be taken to secure a reduction in these charges in respect of visits by relatives to war graves in France and Flanders.With regard to theatres of war not provided for in the schemes of the Y.M.C.A. and other institutions, it appears out of the question, at present, to make arrangements for visits like those contemplated to France and Flanders.W. S. C.The War Office,1st June, 1920,(B20/241)  100  C/20  HA.8  823(hvo
