QIMilitary Secret.lbSl.........Ffy&amp;fficcroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India,\ l&amp;fe 3/aj, 1920. &apos;[Repeated to Teheran anil Meshed.) (Received 20th.)622 S.   Your telegram of 6th May to Army Department.   Withdrawal of Meshed ,Force.   It is probable that as soon as the facts are known Bolsheviks and Persian Democrats may issue propaganda announcement on  the subject.    We think it advisable to anticipate such propaganda by issuing to the Press and sending over the wireless our own version.   Following is announcement which we propose to issue subject to any comments by you or Minister at Teheran.   We suggest simultaneous      J publication in London, Teheran, and Meshed.   (Corrupt group) news of decision to withdraw British troops from East Persia does not come as a surprise.   It has been known for some time past that this move was under contemplation.   For ever since the fall of Krasnovodsk in February last and the cessation of fighting between volunteer forces and Bolsheviks close to trans-Caspian Frontier of Persia, reasons /for which they had been retained in Meshed, that is to prevent volunteer army being followed across the border into Persia by the Bolsheviks, had ceased to exist.   Delay in their withdrawal has, it is understood, provided Bolsheviks with propaganda weapons which they have not been slow to use.   For some time past they have been trying to make capital out of the presence of British troops in North Eastern Persia by pointing out in their wireless communiques and in pressing that the Anglo-Persian agreement had been forced by British on a reluctant Persia, and that British forces were kept in that country to enforce its execution, or that Shah and his Government, which according to them is universally unpopular, were only kept in power by British troops who alone prevented their overthrow and setting up of a new Government on Bolshevik lines.   Other statements were Eastern Persia had been annexed by British ; that the British were building barracks and houses on enormous scale round Meshed, and that these were of such a permanent nature that this could only indicate they had no intention of ever withdrawing;  and that they were making wholesale requisitions without any payment thereby reducing local population to verge of starvation.   In actual fact the popularity of British troops in Meshed has been very great, especially as they have proved a considerable source of income to inhabitants, who it is believed will be genuinely sorry at their departure.   Nothing could have shown more conclusively the sincerity of the motives inspiring British Government in their attempt to strengthen Persia and to enable her to stand alone than the present decision to recall Meshed force to India
