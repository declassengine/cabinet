THE GEIERAL COMMAHDIHG-IN-CHIEF.To His Excellency General Count Cadorna,Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Armiesat DBIHE.My dear General,General Robertson and General Weygand on their return from Italy have told me of your wish to be settled in your mind as soon as possible as to the direct support which could even-tually be afforded- to you by the French and English forces.of such direct support have not yet been determined; for this is essentially a question of operations which depends on the respective situations of the forces in presence of one another at the moment when such support shall be considered necessary.on the 15th and 16th November, 1916, were wholly justified in not determining whether such support should be direct or indirect.X        The Ho. IY of the decisions taken by the General-in-Ch at the Conference at Chantilly, runs as follows &quot;In the event of one of the Powers being attacked the others shall come to the rescue in the fullest degree possible, either indirectly by offensives launched from Armies not attacked on prepared points or directly by the despatch of troops between theatres of operations connected by the easy communications.&quot;I have the honour to inform you that the conditionsFurther, the Allies at the Conference at Chantilly

NivelleI have fceen obliged to conform to this line of conduct in my interview with your Excellency in the course of my journey to Udine, as also in my letters 7650 of the 9th February and 16412 of the 20th, March.   Moreover the examination of the question of transport and supply which has been jointly made by the French and Italian General Staffs exhibits the fact that I have closely considered the contingency of direfit support and that I have taken steps that such may be realised at the desired moment with all the rapidity and efficacy necessary.In order to give you new proof ef the closeness of our relations I am asking the French and English War Committees to define precisely some of the conditions under which the French and English troops cojtld eventually iperate on the Italian Front.And further, I would ask you to authorise me to send you at an early date, a General Officer instructed to study on the spot the tactical conditions of an eventual employment of French troopsi   This General Officer would be accompanied by some Staff Officers and by an Officer of special technical knowledge with regard to the use of heavy artillery by rail.I will advise you as to the decision of the French War Committee as soon as this has been reached.&quot;beg your Excellency to accept the expressions of my most kind and cordial regards.
