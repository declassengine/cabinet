G. T. - 345. WAR CABINET *&apos;THE PRICE 0? EOIJB-GRQWiI WHIU.g. (Memorandum &quot;by the Pood Controller)I desire to direct the attention of the Cabinet.to the high prices now being obtained for English wheat; Prices of 90/- and 91/- per quarter have been reported from different parts of the country.   As English wheat becomes scarcer millers who rely upon a certain quantity to maintain the character of their mixtures, are willing to pay exceptional prices to secure it.The course of English wheat prices since last harvest may be indicated by the Gazette weekly averages at the end of each month:-Gazette&apos;price at   Equivalent 480 lbs, per at 504 lbs.quarter. per quarter.	s.	d.	s.	d.September 30th -	58.	.10.	61.	9,October 28th -	.62,	.10.	66.	1.November 25th -	70.		74,	2.December 30th -	..75.	10.&apos;	79.	7,January 27th -	75..	10.	,79.	7.February 24th -	76..	9.	. 00.	7.March 31st -	81..	5.	05.	6.The Gazette averages represent wheat at 480 lbs, per quarter, whereas the newspaper quotations usually represent wheat at 504 lbs. per quarter, the weight at which it is commonly sold.-/The:&apos;
She pricss at- which imported wheat, is now being sold by the wheat Commission, cover&apos; a wide range for the various classes, the extremes being from 69/- (per 450 lbs) for the lowest grade Manitob(Ho. 6 Special) to 87/6 (per 492 lbs) for Choice White Bombay. Same&apos; - thewhere about 80/- to 52/- would represent the level at which/largerquantity is no?* being offered.The course of-wheat:prices.in the countries of origin during the next few months cannot be predicted with any certainty,.    They //ill depend mainly in the immediate future on the prospects of the A:, eric an crop,     It is fairly certain, however, that the prices of English wheat will continue to riso unless some check is put upon them,,     The Question therefore arises whether the time has not-arrived for fixing maximum prices for home-grown wheat.There are strong reasons for putting a check on the continued rise in prices.    As compared with the pre-war level the rise amount to about 150 per cent,  and it is obvious that the profits,  after all allowance is made for increased cost of production, are large, and certainly much larger than on any other kind of farm produce, A feeling of indignation against the wheat growing farmer as a profiteer is becoming widespread, and may become a menace to the agricultural policy of the Government. -I submit, therefore.., for the consideration of the War Cabinet that maximum prices should&apos;be fixed for home-grown wheat of the 1916 crop,      The actual price has been discussed with the President of the Board of- Agriculture, and I suggest that it should be fixed at 76/- per 480 lbs, which is equal to. 80/- per quarter Of 5C4 lbs.(Sgd)    DSVOjIPCBT,Ministry of Food.2nd April 1917
