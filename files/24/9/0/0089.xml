g * T * o b 5- - IMPESiAIi &quot;-TRASS REMICSS.Memorandum ny/the &quot;Et. - Eon.&apos; :Sir -Alfred MOnd, Bart., M.P.&apos;,Eiret Commissioner of Dorics p&apos;:Eti?I have the honour to submit a memorandum based on the in-vestigation of the,resources of&apos; the.. British Empire which formed, part of the inquiry by&quot; the&apos;-Committee -.on Commercial &apos;and Industrial Policy pre&amp;iiad over by Lord Balf our of Burleigh, of which I was a member from its inception up to the formation of the present Uinlstry.The dominant fact impressed upon the mind by such an investi-gation .ia the unrivalled commercial power .of the British Empire as a controller of raw material, a. producer of manufactured goods and a market;; for .the commodities of other nations.     The advantages of the control of the resources of the Empire in these directions have been amply demonstrated,by the war, which has further revealed to us the vital importanc^for imperial defence of control by the Home and Dominion Governments of such essential c02im0diti.es as whftat;, wool,- jute., rubber,, etc..    During the war, the urgent necessity of mutual defence has led to the temporary treatment of these&apos; problems from an imperial rather than a local standpoint, with great benefit to^the common cause..     Unless-, however, adeoua-% measures are adopted in good time:,- it will, unfortunatedy, be im-posaihie.-to&apos;-maintain this imperial attitude and action on the re-sumption of ordiusr-y commercial life after the war.     .&apos;Tet, surely, it would be -a great misfortune if the co-ordination now effected were allowed to lapse-,: the commercial unit thus established, being permitted, to fall into purely sectional fragments-.!Chu8 we&apos; are driven to ask if it is possible to treat the Empire in future as it has been during the war as one great and powerful unit to be utilised for the fullest advantage of all its citizens?     The advantages aojfcniing from the adoption of such a course in war as well as in peace are striking andienlf es t.     In war it is of the utmost importance as we have latterly, discovered, to have control in one   own territory of -essential&apos;products, and to be able to divert them to such parts of the Empire as are in reed o thess, &amp;b also to develop&apos; them rapidly and in unison with a general plan.&apos;:    All through the present war we have been largely dependent upon the United States of America and other neutral countries for a considerable proportion of our supplies, and have had to rely upon the friendliness of those nations for their maintenance. Such&amp; position, even in the case of governments well disposed to us, must give rise to anxiety and hamper in many respects the freedom of action of a belligerent State,     The grater the propor-of supplies produced within the. Empire the less would be our dependence on other countries in future conflicts.,&apos; as also the greater the security - and certainty of obtaining their full use for the/Empire and preventing any of them reaching enemy countriesv A comparative independence of supplies from outside would also much facilitate the settlement&quot; of trouble some questions of finance and exchange, which in themselves have been a source of continual anxiety throughout the present war.-
All these considerations point to the urgent necessity of endeavouring to develop the resources of the Empire in times of peace as well as in war to their maximum intensity.    The question is how can this object be best accomplished.    The answer would appear to be by-treating imperial resources in the same way as the owner of a large estate would treat his property, namely,  to utilio.6 each part: of it - to the highest, advantage by providing that every section is devoted to what it can produce best and cheapest, instead of each part trying to produce evcry-thing-, -sometimes under very uneconomical conditions.   The first step towards ouch a result would,  theoretically, - be. the abolition of customs barriers &quot;between the different parts of the Empire - in fact Imperial Free Trade. &apos; If the whole British Empire were contained,  like the United States of America,  in one vast con-tinent,  there is no doubt that such a policy would have found acceptance long ago,  as it has already found acceptance in such parts of the Empire&apos; as have been formed into Dominions or Common-wealths,  such as Australia in recent years, where tariff barriers existing between the&quot; different States have been abolished in favour of an all-round Commonwealth tariff.    There is no essen-tial reason why there should be a tariff between the Dominion of Canada and the United Kingdom that would not justify a tariff between British Columbia and Quebec.A striking argument for&apos;.this unification of the whole British Empire is furnished by the recent economic conference between our German and Austro-Hungarian enemies.    That confer-ence shows that the pressure of. political and military necessity is driving the entirely independent States of Central Europe seriously to consider a policy of Free Trade with each other as a means of enhancing their joint forces both for aggression and defence-.    With such an example before us and in view of the numerous private arommercial interests which have been subordin-ated during the war&apos;to&apos;the common interests of the Empire we should no longer be so nervous in the pursuit of great imperial reforms as to the danger of temporary dislocation which such changes might involve for individual trades and traders.   At the same - time it is,- perhaps,  too much to hope, under existing cir-cumstances, that the ideal of Empire Free Trade is capable&apos;of immediate realisation.   Yet its ultimate achievement should not be despaired of by those.who hope to See a thoroughly united Empire exercising It maximum strength.-The question might fairly be&apos; asked, however,  whether the time, has not arrived,  at any rate so far as the future is con-cerned, when tariff questions of the constituent parts of the -Empire could be considered.in something more than their merely local aspects, and&apos;;whether, in. the name of the whole Empire, resistance might not be offered, to claims put:.forward on behalf of purely local interests however powerful.    The preference which the Dominions have granted to Great Britain have undoubtedly been a considerable step in this direction.-   A further extension of this principle- would be of great value,  if it were not accom-panied by such an alteration in an upward direction of tariff schedules as. to render quite impossible the Competition of iin-ported British goods with. Dominion manufactured goods.   From an immediate practical&quot;point of view something- of - the nature of an Imperial Tariff Commission would seem to be feasible-    It would be the duty of this Commission not in any way to interfere with the fiscal autonomy of the various parts cf the Empire,  hut only tc study and report upon the manner in which the proposed tariff changes would affect the various industries throughout the Empire.The more-fact that imperial interests were being considered in these matters would in itself havu a very considerable molllfy-ing effect upon the feelings of any trade affected adversely both in the country in which the tariff was under discussion and
in the country where trade would be adversely affected by the  iteration.     It would further enable the respective Govern-ments to bring to their assistance - imperial public opinion against narrow sectional interests.     Ibis proposal would in no \/ay interfere with the fiscal autonomy of; any;part of the Empire, the rights of which would not unnaturally be-; jealously marded by the various governments and legislatures responsible to their own electors.A further important advantage of dealing with the Empire e.s an economic unit would be its enormous bargaining power when negotiating comaercial treaties with other countries. (Ellis -refers not merely to the question of tariffs on imported nanufactures&apos; but also .to the very important question of the export of valuable raw materiel.-     It is- obvious that the more you have to&apos; offer the more you can obtain, and, although all the great constituent parts of the Empire have no doubt in themselves valuable attractions and concession to offer In return for favourable trade terms by other, countries, their collective force would be simply overwhelming.     Indeed no one who has had to investigate this aspect of the problem can have, any doubt that there is&apos; no other combination in the world in, so strong a position in -this respect as the British Empire. This might reverse the tendency, which unfortunately has been growing, of different parts of the Empire conducting their own commercial negotiations, a tendency which, can only- have sprung up owing to the want of any imperial organisation adequate to assuming that task.     It is surely not too much to hope, in vie?/ t)f the much closer union into which the Empire has been drawn in this terrible crisis, that-effective machinery can be created to deal in manner satisfactory to all parties with such an object.If the united Kingdom were to adopt a tariff system this would not affect the free entry of British Empire goods into this country.     Furthermore whatever tariff is adopted should be so arranged as to operate as a very extensive preference to the Dominions etc.     In the case of tea, wines, etc., in which customs duties are now levied, a preference ought to be granted to British Empire products.It cannot of course be denied that a policy of the kind outlined would necessitate mutual concessions and a certain subordination of various widely distant interests to a common end. But when one thinks how the Empire has ralliedtogether and .the splendid devotion shown by its various constituent nations in this great war, how men from remote parts of the world have for the first time formed a great oand of blood-brotherhood, is it really asking an impossi-Mlity that in material things similar sacrifices, should be made after the.war to maintain for future generations what has been won today by such terrific loss of Siife and treasure?
