S E C RET.G.T. 3^8 WARTHE IRISH SITUATION   II..In a previous memorandum it was pointed out that if the Irish difficulty is to he solved at all on the lines of e some form of Home Rule, it can only he solved by Irishmen making themselves responsible for finding a solution which will both meet the views of. Ulster and satisfy the aspirations of thrs Nationalists for the unity of Ireland.      lhat solution cannot be&apos;found by attempting to graft amendments on to the existing Home Rule Act. which vaB drafted in London to fit House of Commons conditions.     It can only be &quot;found by Irishmen themselves devising in consultation an entirely new system of Government suited to -Irish conditions.- Such a system of Government must, as regards the form of the Irish constitution,  contain inherent in Ats own structure the guarantees and safeguards against misgovern-ment or oppression which the Protestant minority, will - insist on having before it can venture upon even the most limited partnership with the Catholic and Nationalist majority.    One of the fatal defects of the existing measure is that its framework is based cn the assumption .that Ireland is a homogeneous community,  in which the ordinary rules of majority government and direct election can be applied without qualifi-cation.      To try and iack on guarantees in the interests of the minority to a constitution so framed is an absurdity. Guarantees against unfair legislation can only, cover the very narrowest ground,   mless, indeed, all legislation is to be paralysed.     On th-: other hand guarantees against executive - or administrative oppression,  or rimefficiency, reduce themselves in fact to the veto of the Lord Lieutenant, who is powerless if his ministers refuse to carry on.A consti1ution,which is tc work in Ireland, under&apos; present conditions   must have- its guarantees inherent in its&apos; structure,  in other words it must be based from the very foundation on the recognition either of the separate character of the Ulster Protestant ciuimunity, or on the distinction between a Protestant . and a Catholic voter,      Given that recognition, it is possible to devise more than one form of government which could work.     One or&apos; two alternative suggestions are put forward in the present memorandum, not in order to forestall the task which- must necessarily be left to-an Irish Conference or Convention, but for the purpose of illustration.A solution recently   proposed in the &quot;Observer&quot;, was. that two separate. Home Rule Governments,- enjoying equal powers,  should be set up in Ireland,  one &quot;for Nationalist Ireland and one for Ulster, and that pending Ulster&apos;s willing-ness at some future date to be directly incorporated with Nationalist Ireland the common interests and common sentiment, of Ireland should bo. fostered by a standing Conference between the two legislatures-      It is no very great step from this proposal to a - Dual- system such as . exists in Austria-Hungary, where certain specified common business is transacted by Parliamentary delegations, proposals laid before the delegations by the common Ministers having to secure a sep-arated majority in each delegation.      In this way it might be possible to secure for Ireland unity of legislation and administration on certain limited and less contentious matters of common interest, while reserving all the more/ contentious
ncontentious issues for the separate legislatures.If it is desired to combine guarantees for Ulster.? s local local freedom from Publin Government with a still greater degree of Irish unity, a-solution might bo found in retaining two sep-arate administrations,, each depending1 on its own House of Commons, but to have a single Upper Chamber common to tho whole of Ireland. n &apos;*Such an Upper Chamber could not control finance or interfere with administration,      But it could both initiate legislation for tjie whole of Ireland,  leaving it to be passed, with or without amendments, in each of the lower Houses, and serve as a chock,  in the common interests of Ireland, on hasty or oppressive legislation      originating in the Lower Houses,The success of such a scheme would depend almost entirely upon tho composition of the common Upper House for all Ireland..      It obviously could not be a house in which the&apos; Nationalist or Roman Catholic element was in a-majority propor-tionato to its majority in th* population of Ir&apos;land, for,, in. that cas&quot;,  it would&quot;bpAn to th&apos;&apos; criticism that it would lot through all Dublin legislation and block all Belfast legislation.     Tiio boot way to mout that objection is to hav&quot;1 both sections equally represented. or to give them equal power, and to faco th-  religious difficulty by frankly making it the basis of th&apos;1 al^ctoral system for tho Upp-&quot;r HouseOur ordinary electoral syst mis has - d on the acsump-tion that all citizens or&apos;1 men of more or loss thn same funda-m-ntal typ^ cone rn-d in ax---rcising thr franchise in order to further th&apos;dr views as to th&quot; brst government for tho community or to protect tbwir int-&apos; rests.      It makes no allowance for divisions among th^n of race or religion so profound as to bo incompatible with it.     But such differences do exist and it is the part of wisdom to r&apos;cognis- thorn in our institutions instead of aggravating them by pretending to ignore them.    When tho extension of the Indian Councils system was carried out it was realised from the outset that to put Hindoos and Moslems into a single electorate would mean tho practical disfranchise-raent of tho Moslem community in the greater part of India, and an endless vista of bitter religious contests wh^royor the two elements wore in anything like equal strength.      Tho simple solution was to have separate Hindoo and Moslem electorates::    the two creeds are not brought into competition, and tho election of a particular, candidate is governed by his views on political issues.Bohemia twenty years ago was a political bear garden in which Czech extremists advocating the,establishment of an independent Bohemia, where the German minority should be effectively suppressed, vied with Pan-G -man fanatics clamour-ing for the German Empire to come over the border and enforce German &quot;Kultur&quot; on a troublesome inferior racoc     By a happy inspiration tho
-Austrian Government decided to divide the country into separate . Czech and German constituencies.     Czech and German voters, no longer interested in the German-Czech dog-fight, chose their representatives not for their anti-Germanism or cnti-Czechism tut &quot;because they were Conservatives,.--Liberals or &quot;Socialists. Czech Socialist deputies and German Socialist deputies worked in unison in the Bohemian Diet and in the Austrian Reichstat, and racialism though not extinguished, as the present war has shown, was strikingly mitigated.The essence of the Irish situation is that the differ-ence between the two elements in Ireland is not like the ordinary difference between Liberal and Conservative in England, and never can be, in cur generation at least.     Ilor is it like tho difference between English Protestant and English Catholic, a difference non-existent unless some specific question like education turns up where religious interests are directly affected.     It is essentially of the same character as the difference between Hindoo and Moslem, or between Czech and German, a cleavage&apos;which the difference in religion, history end upbringing Ins made so deep that it is impossible to treat it as non-existent.As long an the Union was net seriously challenged and the contest between the two kinds of Irishmen did not affect legislation or tho actual administration of the country, the cleavage mattered less - and that fact has always been one of the strongest arguments for the Union.     The moment Home Rule was seriously mooted it emerged as an almost insuperable obstaclea The crude and obvious way to meet the difficulty was to separate that portion of Ireland where the Protestant Irish arc in a majority from the rest.     But the fatal objection to that rough and ready method is that there is no real boundary between the two communities.     Ulster,  in the political sense, is not an erea but a religious and political community, largely concentrated in one area, but, in the v ry centre of that area, living side by side with the nationalist community, and extending its outliers far beyond any frontier thet can possibly be.suggested.      There can be no frontier for a separate Ulster which does not involve injustice to Nationalist Irish within it and to Ulstermen and Irish Protestants left without it.The suggestion here put forward is that if there is to be a common representative assembly for Ireland, even if it is only a common Upper House, with separate Lower Houses and separate administration, for Ulster and nationalist Ireland, it should be based on the principle of separate Protestant and Catholic electorates.     But in order to prevent the conflict of the two communities from being simply transferred from the constituencies to the Chamber, it is desirable that the recognition of the distinction between the two communities, and the equal rights of each,  should extend to the Chamber itself. The simplest method of achieving this is by prescribing that no rote of the Chamber is of any effect unless it has a majority both of Protestant and of Catholic members.     Or the object might be achieved by having an equal number of representatives of each section and prescribing a.two-thirds vote as necessary for any decision.It is indeed, conceivable that the principle advocated night be sufficiently met if it only extended to the Chamber \ itself.     That .1s to say it might be left to Proportional
Representation to see that the Protestant community secured its fair share of representatives, without the provision of separate religious electorates, as long as the rules of the Chamber itself provided that no veto was valid which was not based on a separate majority both of Jrotostcmt and of Catholic members.    It may be suggested that $ still simpler method of achieving -the same end^ in effect, without avowedly introducing the religious distinction at all, would be to provide that every vote in the Chamber must secure a separate majority from the Ulster representatives as woli as iron those of nationalist Ireland.   &apos;2he* jyj)eetion to this is that it would tend to stereo-typo the goographical division&apos;of Ireland, and hoop alive the socoional antagonism in Ulster, where the Protestant majority would be concerned at all hazards to hoop tho nationalists out of tho Chamber,   It would in fact only bo the Austro-Rungarian system of joint delegations under another name.One -advantage of some such system, whether based on separate electorates or on Proportional Ropresentation and soparato majorities in tho Chamber itself, would be that the minority in each part of Ireland would bo effectively repre-Gontod in the Upper House, and be ablo to act as&apos;a check on oppressive legislation in either part of Ireland, and to havo its voice in tho suggesting of legislation for Ireland as a whole.     On the other hand, In so far as the Lower houses retained the control of tho purse and consequently of tho administration, there could be no fear on the part of Ulster, that this common Upper House could interfere either with Ulster*s liberty or with its prosperity.,   At the same time, as some members&quot;of the administration would probably, in each part of Ireland, bo in the Upper House, there would bo a natural tendency for tho Upper House members of the two Irish Governments to work together for tho passage&quot;of common logis-lation.     She two Governments would, in fact, havo in the Upper House an instrument for tho transaction of common business together, and would gradually for the purposes of that common businoss become something not far off a common government for Ireland.   By tho time that stage had boon reached the situation might have undergone so profound a change that tho voluntary inclusion of Ulster in a completely united Ireland night no longer bo difficult,That it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible to-day, is largely duo to who long concentration of thought in Ulster, and among Unionists in C-reat fsritain, on tho unsatisfactory solution of geographical separation.    It might have been possible some years ago, and may bo not wholly impossible now, to secure a united Ireland from tho start on the basis of a frank recognition&apos;of the fundamental difference botwo on the two Irish communities, and of the impossibility of allowing ono of them to override the other, simply because it happens to be the more numerous,   A single Irish Parliament based on separate electorates, and requiring a majority of tho foprosontativos of each electorate to giv; effect to any vote, could only put into power an executive that enjoyed tho confidence of both elements and was incapable of oppressing either In tho interests
of the other.     It is at any rate not inconceivable that an Irish Conference, once it had faced the problem squarely, and realised the need for admitting the existence of the t.;o Irish communities and for recognising the equality of their status, might drop the demand for territorial separation from the outset and procodd directly to the creation of a single Irish Government.But for that, cr for any other solution, it is essential that the new Irish system of Government should be planned from the foundation by the joint co-operation of the^ representatives of the two Irish communities.     Every provision of every clause must be a matter of joint authorship.    To attempt to deal with the present deadlock by tinkering with the existing Home Rule Bill, which is framed 0,1 principles which ignore the whole cause of the deadlock, is to invite certain failure.&apos;-   The Home Rule Hill offers no solution to the problem. All that its presence cn the Statute Book can do is to emphasise the necessity for finding a txue solution.So far the discussion in the present memorandum has concentrated on rhe form of the future Irish Government.     That i3 the crax of the Irish problem, in so far as it. is a purely Irish problem,,  and that is a problem the Irish can best be left to settle for themselves,     But the question of the powers to be given to such an Irish Government is not only an Irish probleii, but is equally a United Kingdom problem.    The right way to settle it is obviously a United Kingdom Conference or Convention; which should work out a new system of government for the United Kingdom, whecbr it be a dual system embracing Great Britain and Ireland as two units, or a federal system including each of the four constituent nations as a separate state in the federation,     Palling, however, the possibility of such a Convention, then it is essential to remember that the powers assigned to Irels.nl must be such as vfill conform, to some workab&amp;e scheme of federalism hereafter,.  The only alternative is to give Ireland the full and unqualified powers of a Dominion like Canada or New Zealand.    Here again the existing Home Rule Bill with its bastard scheme of powers, offers no solution and is best left out of account altogether.The objections to granting Ireland full Dominion status are almost insuperable.    Prom the- point of view of naval and military defence,  of trade and finance, of social and indus*-trial legislation,  the iislands are so intimately bound up tog-ather that the separation involved in Dominion status - given the present, or any. probable constitution of the Empire - would be disastrous to each, and more.&apos; particularly to Ireland,   As a mere practical detail the fact that Ulster&apos;would not assent to such a scheme&apos;, and that Ulster&apos;1 s exclusion would, in that eventuality,  involve a tariff frontier between it and Nationa-list Ireland,  is enough to rule, out the proposal. It is cenceiv-able that these objections might be surmounted lit the event of a scheme .cf Imperial -Federation so close that the- Imperial Federal Authority would have complete control over an undivided Imperial Navy, ever a common permanent Army,  over inter-Imperial cemmuni-cations, and over a large part of the field of taxation includ-ing tariffa;  in all The Dominions.    But that seems hardly practical politics, and for the immediate future it is only possible to proceed on the assumption that the United Kingdom will remain the unit in the Imperial scheme of things, and that Ireland must find its seIf--goverrjtfr&amp;ig$ within the limits of the United Kingdom.(Initialled)&apos;      L.S0A,April 2, 1917.
