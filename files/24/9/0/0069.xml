[Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1917.CONFIDENTIAL. pfft T \Lh )w --If \Ui 1 * yvTclegramme circulaire russe du 4 mars, 1915, aw sujet    Constantinople et desDetroits.LE cours des derniers evenements amene Sa Majeste 1&apos;Empereur Nicolas a penser que la question de Constantinople et des Detroits doit etre resolue definitivement, selon les aspirations seculaires de la Russie.Toute solution serait insuffisante et precaire. si la ville de Constantinople, la rive occidental du Bosphore, de la mer de Marmara et des Dardanelles, ainsi que la Thrace meridionale ju.squ&apos;a la ligne fiuos-Midia, n&apos;etaient desormais incorporees a I&apos;Empire russe.I)e meme, et par necessite strategique, la partie du littoral asiatique comprise cntre le Bosphore, la riviere Sakharia et un point a fixer sur le golfe dTsmid, les iles de la mer de Marmara, les iles d&apos;Imbros et de Teiiedos devront etre incorporees a 1&apos;Empire.Les interets speciaux de la France et de la Grande-Bretagne dans la region ci-dessus designee seronfc scrupuleusement respectes.Le Gouvernement Imperial se plait a, esperer que les considerations ci-dessus seront accueillies avec sympathie par les deux Gouvernements allies. Lesdits Gouvernements allies sont assures de rencontrer aupres du Gouvernement Imperial la meme sympathie pour la realisation des desseins qu&apos;ils peuvent former en d&apos;autres regions de 1&apos;Empire ottoman comme ailleurs.Petrograde, le 4 mars, 1915.SUBJECT to the war being carried on and brought to a successful conclusion, and to the desiderata of Great Britain and France in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere being realised, as indicated in the Russian communication herein referred to, His Majestys Government will a^ree to the Russian Governments aide-memoire relative to Constantinople and the Straits, the text of which was communicated to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Ambassador by his Excellency M. Sazonof on the 4th March,HIS Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been instructed to make the following observa^ tions with reference to the aide-memoire which this Embassy had the honour oi addressing to the Imperial Government on the 12th March, 19 L5.The claim made by the Imperial Government in their aide-memoire of the 4th March, 19 L5, considerably exceeds the desiderata which were foreshadowed by M. Sazonof as probable a few weeks ago. Before His Majesty&apos;s Government have had time to take into consideration what their own desiderata elsewhere would be in the final terms of peace, Russia is asking for a definite promise that her wishes shall be satisfied with regard to what is in fact the richest prize of the entire war. Sir Edward Grey accordingly hopes that M. Sazonof will realise that it ie, not in the power of His Majestys Government to give a greater proof of friendship than that which is afforded by the terms of the above-mentioned aide-memoire. That document involves a complete reversal of the traditional policy of His Majesty !s Government, and is in direct opposition to the opinions and sentiments at one time universally held in England and which have still by no means died out.   Sir EdwardAide-memoire communicated to Russian Government.1915.Petrograd, March 12, 1915.Memorandum.
Grey therefore trusts that the Imperial Government will recognise that the recent general assurances given to M. Sazonof have been most loyally and amply fulfilled. In presenting the aide-memoire now, His Majesty&apos;s Government believe and hope that a lasting friendship between Russia and Great Britain will be assured as soon as the proposed settlement is realised.From the British aide-memoire it follows that the desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government, however important they may be to British interests in other parts of the world, will contain no condition which could impair Russia&apos;s control over the territories described in the Russian aide-memoire of the 4th March, 1915.In view of the fact that Constantinople will always remain a trade entrepot for Sou til-Eastern Europe and Asia Minor, His Majesty&apos;s Government will ask that Russia shall, when she comes into possession of it, arrange for a free port for goods in transit to and from non-Russian territory. His Majesty&apos;s Government will also ask that there shall be commercial freedom for merchant-ships passing through the Straits, as M. Sazonof has already promised.Except in so far as the naval and military operations on which His Majesty&apos;s Government are now engaged in the Dardanelles may contribute to the common cause of the Allies, it is now clear that these operations, however successful, cannot be of any advantage to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the final terms of peace. Russia alone will, if the war is successful, gather the direct fruits of these operations. Russia should therefore, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, not now put difficulties in the way of any Power which may, on reasonable terms, offer to co-operate with the Allies. The only Power likely to participate in the operations in the Straits is Greece. Admiral Carden has asked the Admiralty to send him more destroyers, but they have none to spare. The assistance of a Greek flotilla, if it could have been secured; would thus have been of inestimable value to His Majesty&apos;s Government.To induce the neutral Balkan States to join the Allies was one of the main objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government had in view when they undertook the operations in the Dardanelles* His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that Russia will spare no pains to calm the apprehensions of Bulgaria and Roumania as to Russia&apos;s possession of the Straits and Constantinople being to their disadvantage. His Majesty&apos;s Government also hope that Russia will do everything in her power to render the co-operation of these two States an attractive prospect to them.Sir E. Grey points out that it will obviously be necessary to take into considera-tion the whole question of the future interests of France and Great Britain in what is now Asiatic Turkey ; and, in formulating the desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the Ottoman Empire, he must consult the French as well as the Russian Government. As soon, however, as it becomes known that Russia is to have Constantinople at the conclusion of the war, Sir E. Grey will wish to state that throughout the negotiations, His Majesty&apos;s Government have stipulated that the Mussulman Holy Places and Arabia shall under all circumstances remain- under independent Mussulman dominion.Sir E. Grey is as yet unable to make any definite proposal on any point of the British desiderata; but one of the points of the latter will be the revision of the Persian portion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 so as to recognise the present neutral sphere as a British sphere.Until the Allies are in a position to give to the Balkan States, and especially to Bulgaria and Roumania, some satisfactory assurance as to their prospects and general position with regard to the territories contiguous to their frontiers to the possession of which they are known to aspire; and until a more advanced stage of the agreement as to the French and British desiderata in the final peace terms is reached, Sir E. Grey points out that it is most desirable that the understanding now arrived at between the Russian, French, and British Governments should remain secret.Petrograd, March 12, 1915.Note verbale remise par M. Paleologue d son Excellence M. Sazonof, le 12 avril, 1915,en reponse au precedent.LE Gpuvernement de la Republique donnera son agrement a 1&apos;aide-memoire russe remis par M. Isvolsky a M. Delcasse, le 6 mars dernier, et relatif a Constantinople et aux Detroits, a condition que la guerre sera poursuivie jusqu&apos;a la victoire et que la France et la Grande-Bretagne realisent leurs desseins en Orient comme ailleurs, ainsi qu&apos;il est dit dans 1&apos;aide-memoire russe.
