fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]NOTE PREPARED BY THE CHIEE OE THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF FOR THE WAR COMMITTEE, ON THE ASSISTANCE THAT DIPLO-MACY MIGHT RENDER TO NAVAL AND MILITARY OPERATIONS.MY object in submitting this paper is to put forward certain suggestions as to the manner in which diplomatic action might assist the naval and military forces and prepare the way for the execution of concordant strategic plans. It is obviously as necessary to have a definite diplomatic plan of campaign as it is to have a purely naval or military plan.2. During the early stages of the war the small numbers of the British Army made it play a subsidiary part, and permitted the British Commanders to exercise only a small influence on the general strategy of the campaign. As the strength of the British Army has increased so the influence of Great Britain has grown in the Councils of the Allies, and it &quot;may now be said that this country is daily establishing a position of greater influence in determining the strategy of the Entente. Further, as local stocks become exhausted the dependence of our Allies upon British shipping becomes accentuated and the real meaning and importance of British Sea Power is brought home to them, but, as far as I am able to judge, our diplomatic influence has not increased yari passu with the growth of our naval and military influence. Great Britain has been obliged on many occasions to suboidinate her interests to those of other Powers, and has even been forced to assent to courses of action which were strategically unsound and which considerably increased her military difficulties.3. We do not hold as a natian the position to which we are entitled by our contribution to the prosecution of the war, a contribution which may be assessed at twice that of anv other of the Entente Powers. Those Powers are in urgent need of the strong guidance which our contribution justifies us in offering. We have hitherto abrogated the right to guide and have taken too modest a view of our own powers and abilities while exaggerating those of our Allies, a proceeding for which the events of the war offer little justification. Speaking from a military standpoint, I can say that, after I-g- years&apos; experience, my opinion regarding the capabilities of the French Commanders and Staff Officers is not a very high one, and, with very rare exceptions, I believe this opinion would be concurred in by every British General in France.4. Further, a time of stress is coming upon the Allies, as it always comes in war to the belligerents of both sides. To meet it, moral courage, tenacity, and determination are required, and these qualities we possess in far greater measure than any of our Allies. Of these France is apt to be swayed more by emoticn and sentiment than by cool judg-rnent and common-sense, and in Russia the greed and self-interest of the Bureaucracy clog the wheels of the machinery oi Government. Wre should maintain a just apprecia-both of our own powers and of the limitations of our Allies, should seek to give the latter the support and encouragement they require, and should supply that firm and consistent guidance in foreign policy and strategy of which they stand in need.5. It is as important that there should be one supreme control in foreign policy as it is in military operations, for each of the Allies has her own interests which, if not sub-ordinated to the main end of winning the war bv defeating Germanv, are certain to lead to divergent and wasteful effort. Signs of irresolution in their policy are not wanting at the present moment. France is beginning to run short of men and is feeling the heavy strain of the war. Russia is suffering from want of organising power, and in the realms of diplomacy is inclined to follow some wiil-o&apos;-the-wisp, such as the conquest of Constantinople, rather than the practical aim of defeating the enemy and regaining her lost provinces. Italy&apos;s whole-hearted co-operation is open to doubt so long as khe does not declare war against Germany, and there are many [453] &quot;
points of friction between herself on the one hand and Prance and Serbia on the other, owing chiefly to her jealousy of. any other Power obtaining a footing on the Adriatic. Japan frankly entered on the war for what she could get out of it, and once she had obtained Tsihg Tau she was satisfied to await the result in the meantime making a handsome profit out of the supply to Russia of munitions paid for by British gold. All the Allied Powers look to a daily increasing extent to Great Britain for financial and other assistance, and this should be given on the condition that her voice has greater weight in determining the Allied policy. As the success of the Central Powers is due largely&quot; to the assumption by Germany of the control of their policy, so the future success of the Entente will be dependent chiefly upon the exercise by one of its members of a predominant influence over the others. As none of the Powers could hope to carry on the war for any length of time without the help of England, it is clear that no one of them is so well qualified as England to assume the chief direction of the policy of the whole.6. German diplomacy has during the war had four main objects, firstly, to bring in neutral States on the&apos; side of the Central Powers so as to increase the reserves of men, and to weaken the Entente Powers by causing them to disseminate their forces; secondly, to stir up dissension between the members of the Entente, with the ultimate object of breaking it up ; thirdly, to cause internal troubles within the territories of individual members of the Alliance; and, fourthly, to check their supplies of food, raw materials, and munitions of war. In order to counter these aims the diplomacy of the Allies should have corresponding objects in view.7. The area in which diplomatic action may be expected to bear most fruit is the Near East. Short of the defeat of the main Austro-German forces, nothing would ease the British military situation more effectually than the peace with Turkey. There are 17 British divisions in Egypt and Mesopotamia engaged either in watching or fighting Turks; while 150,000 Russians are operating in the Caucasus. Turkish troops may at any time be brought up to attack the Anglo-French forces in Salonika, and the unrest in the Mohammedan world is spreading from Turkey, through Persia and Afghanistan, towards India, thus necessitating the maintenance of a large army in that country. Once Turkey has ceased to be hostile the greater part of these troops will be released for operations elsewhere. Further, by detaching Turkey from the Central Powers, the position in the Balkans would be improved, for Bulgaria might be tempted to retire from the struggle, the pro-Entente tendencies of Iloumania would be strengthened, and Germany&apos;s access to Constantinople would be barred.S. There is one essential condition of peace with Turkey, namely, that she should he permitted to retain Constantinople, and probably the most difficult diplomatic task would he to obtain the consent of Russia to this condition. Russia, however, ousdit to have, like ourselves, but one immediate aim, that of beating Germany and winning the war. At present her position is not t:;o favourable, a large part of her territory is in German hands, and owing to the want of convenient ports, she is to a great extent cut off from the means of cither importing munitions of war or of exporting her produce.9. By making peace with Turkey, Russia would stand to gain quite as much as would Great Britain. Her troops in the Caucasus would become available for operations on her western front, and her prospects of overpowering the Austro-German armies and of thus regaining her territories, now in hostile occupation, would be to that extent increased. Her chances in this respect would also be improved by the augmented power of Great Britain in the western theatre. Russia can only gain Constantinople by defeating Germany. If she loses the war, not merely will she lose all hope of Constantinople, but she will also lose a large part of her European territories, whose population will go to swell the future German armies, and reduce the disproportion between the size of the two Empires. It would therefore undoubtedly be wiser for liussia to ensure the integrity of her dominions than to jeopardize that integrity for the sake of something which she may never get. The opening of the Straits would also materially improve both her military and financial situation. Whatever importance Russia may attach to the possession of Constantinople, she can hardly be so blind as not to see the truth of the above reasoning.10. Should all attempts to induce Russia to come to terms with Turkey fail, the next most promising diplomatic enterprise from the military standpoint would be to detach Bulgaria from Germany. It is probable that a large section of the Bulgarian population is not favourably disposed to the present war, and is much more drawn towards Russia than to Germany. Bulgaria has. however, been involved in the war, firstly by the pro-German and the anti-Russian bias of her Tsar, secondly by her
dissatisfaction.with the terras of the Treaty of Bucharest and, finally by her enmity with Serbia and her desire to reunite to herself the Bulgarian population of Macedonia.11. There is only one way to detach Bulgaria from the Central Powers, and that is to offer her more than Germany, can promise. Germany Y terms are believed to be a fronlier from the Danube at Semendria, along the Morava to i\ish, thence to Prizrend and across Albania to the Adriatic, and back along the existing Greek boundary, south of Monastir, to Doiran. It is doubtful if Bulgaria has any desire to become an Adriatic Power, for her wishes lead her more naturally towards the iEgean, and although Oehrida and Monastir may have attractions for her, Salonika and Ivavalla have greater. If, therefore, the Entente were to offer her the Enos-Midia line on the east and the line of the Yardar on the west, from . its mouth to Veles, and thence through Egri-Palanka to the existing frontier west of Kustendil, it is inconceivable that she would not welcome it. Greece has forfeited all claim to consideration, owing to her treacherous repudiation of her treaty with Serbia. She is not likely to fight to retain Kavalla, as the Entente could at once hand over Salonika to the Bulgars and thus cut off the Greek troops in Eastern Macedonia by land from the rest of Greece, and prevent their obtaining any supplies by sea. Even if Greece were to resist the Bulgars she would be playing into our hands, as the Bulgars would then be fighting on our side and against the Germans. Similarly resistance by the Turks to the Bulgarian occupation of the country west of the Enos-Midia line would throw Bulgaria into our arms. It is just probable that the effect on.the Bulgarian population of an offer such as that mentioned above would be so great that King Ferdinand would be powerless, to oppose its acceptance. If he did, there Avould be a popular rising which might lead to his elimination, a desirable conclusion in the interests of the Entente.VI. The proposed offer to Bulgaria affects only Turkey, with whom we are at war, and Greece, to whom we owe no consideration. Serbia lias lost her kingdom ; so that if the small area east of the line Egri-Palanka-Veles were taken from her she would he losing nothing, and at the final peace she could be compensated with some share of Austrian territory. As the Monastir district and Serbia east of the Morava would be restored to her, the compensation to be given to her by Austria need not necessarily be great, and consequently there should be less difficulty in satisfying Italy.13. The conversion of Bulgaria from an enemy into a neutral or even into a friendly state would have the happiest effect on the prospect of the Entente. Iioumania&apos;s active adhesion to their cause would become more probable; a barrier would be erected between Germany and Turkey, so that the latter, deprived of German assistance, might speedily be conquered, while the 200,000 Anglo-French troops in Salonika would be set free.14 Next to the Balkans, Holland presents the most favourable field for diplomatic action. While there can be no question at the present moment of detaching the army necessary for offensive operations through Holland against Germany, great military advantages would-be obtained by Hollands support at a later stage of the war if and when the enemy had been driven from the Belgian coast. Forces based on Holland could then operate in conjunction with the main French and British armies and would be in a favourable position for out-flanking the whole German line. An offensive from Holland would turn the lines of the Meuse and Rhine and would threaten one of the main industrial districts of Germany, including Essen, which is only 30 miles from the Dutch frontier. The closing of the Dutch ports against German imports would increase the stringency of the blockade, the Dutch islands would be of groat value as British submarine bases, and an aerodrome in Holland would permit of raids being carried out against the chief industrial centres of Westphalia and Western Germany. The strategical advantages of Holland&apos;s intervention will therefore be incalculable and no opportunity of laying the foundation for such intervention should, be lost. The methods of diplomacy are necessarily slow and should therefore precede and not await the military events which make the moment for action opportune.15. The means of securing H.olland&apos;s support lie in (a.) Our sea-power. Our blockade policy might be relaxed and commercial con-cessions granted on condition of a secret understanding that Holland would intervene under certain conditions at a later stage of the war.(6.) A promise of the German possessions in the East Indies and Pacific, and perhaps the cession of some of our own East Indian possessions.
16. As it is of great importance that the diplomatic plan of campaign, when undertaken, should he comprehensive and cO^^tS^I&apos;suggest that the problems which confront us in Scandinavia, concerning tli^^^g?y aspect of which I have recently submitted a Paper to the War Commiiil^^pid in the United States, also call for action.17. The conclusions which have been arrived at in the foregoing pages may he summarised as follows: (1) Great Britain should endeavour to obtain the control of the diplomatic policy of the Entente.(2.) Peace should be made with Turkey, a condition of this being Russia&apos;s assent tothe retention of the Turks in Constantinople. (3.) Should (2) be found impossible, the attempt should be made to detachBulgaria from the Central Powers by offering her the Enos-Midia line andthe Kavalla, Salonika, Veles, and Egri-Palanka districts, delivery ofpossession to be immediate, and contingent only on her promising neutrality.A probable effect of this offer would be-the expulsion of King Ferdinandand war between Bulgaria and Turkev. (4.) Preparations should be made to bring in Holland on the side of the Ententeat such time as the military situation makes this advantageous. (5.) Diplomatic action in uniformity with the general plan of campaign should betaken in Scandinavia and the United States.18. Whether on closer examination the fields of action which I have susroWedDOaboTe prove to be ripe for development or whether there are others in which our interests can be more readily advanced, I am convinced that the Allies should come as soon as possible to an agreement as to the general policy to be adopted, that this policy should, in strict harmony with our naval and military preparations, be offensive in nature, and lastly, and most important of all, that every effort should he made to ensure unity of control in foreign policy by measures similar to those recently taken to bring about a like result in military strategy. This I hold to be the essential point, and such suggestions for the action of diplomacy as I have ventured to submit have been made solely with the object of pointing out&apos;where from a military point of view such action appears to be most needed, and of enabling the War Committee to come to an early decision. With my limited knowledge of what is and what is not possible I cannot do more than offer suggestions.W. E, ROBERTSON, General,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.- War Office, February 12, 1916.
