ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH. .31st March, 1917.Sir,MOTOR TRACTORS AITD PLOUGHS.I am directed by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to inform you that arrangements are in oourse of completion with regard to the future management of the motor ploughs which have been put at the disposal of County Committees throughout Scotland.     After various communi-cations with the Motor Trade, the Board have arranged that representatives of that trade should be invited to make themselves responsible in their various distriots for:-(a) Mechanical repairs(b) Supplies of fuel and lubricating oil(o) Procuring transportation and payment of labour t.o operate tractors(d) Removal of tractor from place to plaoe.The Board propose to appoint Hr R. D. Swart, 2 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, to make the necessary arrange-raents to carry out this work locally.     He will get into communication with Motor Engineers situated in centres convenient to the various districts where tractors have been allocated and, so far as the points above enumerated are concerned, the tractors will be put in charge of these looal engineers      The Board feel sure that this arrange-ment will be welcomed by the Committees and their &quot; Executive   /
- 2 -Executive Officers.     As formerly, the Committees * through their Executive Officer or Secretary of the Plough Committee, will make contracts with farmers for ploughing so as to occupy all the tractors as fully as possible.     They will have in view in making their arrangements the situation of the various farms on which ploughing is desired and endeavour, so far as possible, to economise time in making change from one place to another.     In this connection the Board remind Committees&apos;and their Executive Officers of the necessity of examining the land offered for ploughing, as their experience leads them to think that much valuable time has been wasted and considerable damage done to some of the . tractors by the fact that they have been put to work which they were quite unfitted to do.The men at present employed on the tractors will, of course, be continued under the new arrangement, but the Board are confidently expecting that a staff may be found for each tractor sufficient to enable it to be kept running practically day and night.The arrangement contemplated with the Motor-Engineers *   involves a total payment&apos;of 3/- per acre.     The Board will depend on the Executive Officers satisfying themselves as to the extent of the land ploughed, and furnishing certificates on which payment to the engineers can be made.I,am to add that the Board attach great importance to the work of the Tractor Ploughs.     They are confident District Agricultural Committees will do all in their power to secure satisfactory results, and they feel sure the new arrangement which will relieve Committees of a considerable responsibility, will tend to the economical working of the scheme.The   /
tiftj- - 3 - :lThe Board had hoped to have -an.opportunity of discussing this matter with the Executive Officers at a meeting in Edinburgh but,, owing to various circumstances, and especially having in view the need there is for every-one with work to do in the country; being at that work con-tinuously, they have abandoned the idea of asking them to come to town, and they trust that they may be able to give all necessary explanations by correspondence.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H.M.0ONACHERSecretary.The Secretary ,District Agricultural Committee;
