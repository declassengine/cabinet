[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Mfljesty&apos;s Government,]IT is important to ascertain what are the designs of Germany&apos;s present rulers as to the future economic policy of their country, both in the transition period immediately after the war, and in the more settled period succeeding it.The detailed evidence on the subject is considerable. It may be divided roughly into two kinds: firstly, information secured through various agencies, intercepted messages, &amp;c, as to what is being done and thought on the subject; and, secondly, the books, pamphlets, and articles printed on the subject in Germany itself. Neither of these two kinds of evidence lends itself easily to the formation of definite conclusions. The information secured under the first head is scattered and fragmentary, and it is difficult to detect in it the designs of the Government as distinct from the opinions of individuals, and the private operations of individual firms and syndicates. The published literature has the advantage of being more coherent and extensive, for the German Government seems deliberately to have encouraged the public discussion of the subject. But here again it is impossible to say how far the opinions expressed represent what the Government really intends to do as distinguished from what it wishes the public to think that it intends to do. In what follows, therefore, it has seemed best to proceed from the known to the unknown to set out from the known facts of Germany&apos;s economic policy and position previous to the war, and from such definite information as is available as to her economic policy and organisation during the war. In this way it is possible to form a general conception of the problem confronting the authorities on the return of peace. Having thus secured a firm foundation it will be more easy to frame hypotheses and to make use of the various detailed pieces of evidence that are available.One thing, however, can be said with assurance at the outset: that the present rulers of Germany have a definite economic policy in view for the post-war jjeriod. This is a safe conclusion, not only from the establishment of a. special department to direct &quot; the economic transition from war to peace &quot; (which might, in another country, mean much or little), but from the logical and methodical character of modem German policy in general, and from the habit, which is general in Germany, not only in Government circles but among the ordinary public, of regarding commerce, industry and agriculture as instruments for the promotion of aggressively political ends that is, not simply a means for earning a livelihood and supplying the world and the German people with the goods and services they require, but as a leverage for increasing the influence and the striking force of Germany in competition and conflict with other States. Just as, in the words of Clausewitz, so often on German lips, to go to war signifies the adoption of new methods to attain the objects which were aimed at by the rulers of the State in time of peace, so trade and industry are conceived of as being carried on writh the same essentially militarist object in view.As Dr. Helfferich frankly puts it in the opening pages of a book published in 1913 in commemoration of the Emperor&apos;s silver jubilee: &quot;The political resurrection of Germany and the restoration of our military power, which have assured us peace and freedom, are the foundations for the development of our economic strength ; and conversely the increase of our economic strength supports and confirms our position of political and military power ; our economic development has placed us in the position, and will continue to place us in the position, to raise our forces by land and sea to a point in number and equipment which will allow us to look every opponent se\ ereiy in the eyes &quot; ; and he sums up his argument as to the interdependence of the political, the military, and the economic factors, in German policy in the couplet: &quot; Each lives and works in the other, And is woven into one great whole.&quot;We are still so accustomed to free initiative and the absence of ulterior motives in the conduct of individual and corporate enterprise m all fields of our national lite that[89y- -23 j B
it is easy for us to overlook how far-reaching and how close and minute has been the exercise of State control in Germany in the economic field. The tariff, of course, has been an important element in this policy ; but a similar influence has been exerted over banking, the Stock Exchange and the investment of private capital, shipping and ship-building, the extension of foreign and colonial trade, emigration, the teaching of economics at Universities and elsewhere, the discussion of economic subjects in the press, and in many other directions less easy to trace. Two illustrations may perhaps be given as typical of German methods of procedure.. It is surely not a mere coincidence that one of the standard German economic periodicals, the &quot; Weltwirthschaftliches xVrchiv,&quot; edited by a professor at the University of Kiel, who is also Director of an Institute for World Economics, should give pride of place in its two issues for 1916 to two lengthy-reviews of no less than thirty-two books and important articles on the future economic relations between Germany and her present allies. Again, there was founded in Berlin, in Eebruary 1916. a &quot;German-Chinese Association,&quot; one of several similar bodies, to promote German interests in neutral countries. Its objects, as defined in its official organ, are to acquaint the Chinese people with the achievements of German science and industry, and. to promote trade between Germany and China. These objects are to be pursued by establishing German-Chinese schools, hospitals, and libraries, by distributing propagandist literature in China, by assisting scientific and commercial missions to visit China, and by undertaking propaganda among Chinese students in Germany. Thus medicine and learning generally, as well as trade, are to be turned to propagandist uses, and the doctor, the librarian, and the scientist are to collaborate with the trader and manufacturer in a deliberate effort to increase German political influence.That the German Government has an economic policy, worked out in the closest detail, we may thus take for granted. We may also assume that it will make every effort to secure that the terms of peace are not incompatible with the policy so worked out.   Can we find out what the policy is ?Germany&apos;s Pre-War Economic Position.A brief general review of Germany&apos;s pre-war economic policy and position seems to be the safest starting-point for the investigation. The main facts will be familiar ; but it is important to try and see them through German eyes. In what follows, therefore, German sources alone have been used.Germany is the Japan of the European Continent. She is an old country, which, under new and active guidance, has revolutionised her social and economic life during the last half century. With a population still largely feudal in temper and tradition, she has succeeded in combining an old-fashioned docility and conscientiousness with the efficiency resulting from the application of the latest improvements of applied science. The sole object of her rulers, to which all efforts have been directed, has not been to increase the happiness or the comfort, or even the culture, of the people, but to increase the power of the German State.Power in the modern world means not only military power, but economic power. Thus German statesmen, irrespective of their views on internal social policy, were driven into promoting by every means in the State&apos;s disposal the development of the resources of the country and its rapid and scientific industrialisation. As a result Germany, starting late in the race, has become second only to the United Kingdom as a commercial and industrial power. Her population has risen from 45 millions in 1882 to 61,700,000 in 1907, and is estimated at nearly 70 millions to-day. Dr. Helfferich, in his book published in 1913, estimates that her total national income had risen from 1,275,000,000L in 1896 to 2,100,000,0001. in 1913, and states that it would be putting it too low rather than too high to estimate that German industrial production had trebled in the last twenty-five years.*But it was equally the intention of Germany&apos;s rulers that this prodigiously rapid industrial progress should, not be at the expense of German agriculture. The main-tenance of agricultural production was considered desirable, not only because of the influence of the Prussian squirearchy in Government circles, but because it was necessary to prevent Germany from becoming unduly dependent on foreign supplies, and because the country districts provided the best reservoir of healthy and trustworthy soldiers. Germany has therefore industrialised herself without sacrificing her agriculture. Her agricultural workers still number 35 per cent, of the total, as against 12 per cent, in this country, and her agricultural production has increased, not only absolutely, but relatively with the rapid growth of her population.* &quot; Deutschlands Volkswohlstaud,&quot; 6th ed., 1915, pp. 65, 97.
Germany has thus greatly increased in wealth and population without sacrificing her traditions as a military State. But her economic development has exposed her to one serious weakness: it has made her dependent on non-European countries for the raw materials of some of her principal industries.She has sufficient: confidence in her technical equipment and the excellence of her goods, and in her skill in the arts of economic penetration, to feel sure of selling her goods whether direct or through intermediaries if she can only make them. But she realises that by becoming a manufacturing State on a large scale, she has given valuable hostages to fortune. Of the total- German imports in 1913, 58 per cent, consisted of industrial raw materials and semi-manufactured articles^ and the proportion of the former against the latter is constantly increasing. It is thus abundantly clear that, in the words of a recent writer : &quot; If Germany is to maintain her existing rate of industrial progress, she must become increasingly dependent upon access to sources of supply of raw material from abroad.&quot; tThe problem of safeguarding German commerce and industry, by assuring it of its raw material, was much in the minds of German statesmen before the war. It is true that other States, our own included, were exposed to the same risk, and paid no heed to it, in spite of the experience of the cotton famine during the American Civil War ; that the Royal Commission of 1905 on Supplies of Food and Raw Material in time of war never considered the question in this light;. and that no other industrial State in Europe thought it necessary to aim at making itself permanently independent of foreign supplies. But no other State in Europe shares the aim and temper of Germany, or had worked out so thoroughly and logically all the implications of a modern war. It was not enough for her, as it was for the rest of the world, to be dependent upon the goodwill of the countries from which she bought. She desired some more material and tangible security. It was this feeling which was the main practical driving force of the familiar demand for a place in the sun, or what is now euphemistically called a &quot; compact colonial Empire,&quot;^ and it is in this sense that the constantly reiterated demand for &quot;guarantees for peaceful development,&quot; or for the &quot;safeguarding of Germanys economic future,&quot; must be understood. Since the experience of the blockade, and especially since the Paris Conference, the raw material problem has assumed more importance than ever. It is no longer one of many problems, it is the problem of Germany&apos;s immediate economic future, for the whole fabric of recuperation, the re-establishment of Gerraany&apos;s export trade, and of her foreign exchanges, rests upon the replenishing of her exhausted stores of raw material. The seriousness of the situation is not often discussed in detail, for the German Government is naturally unwilling that its enemies should be reminded of the trumps they hold in their hands. $ But behind all the elaborate arguments as to the unworkability of the Paris Conference Resolutions, and as to Germany&apos;s right to assurances that, her trade with the world can develop unhindered,\\ lies the paralysing fear that it is open to her present enemies, in peace-time, to cut off or curtail supplies on which her prosperity depends.If Germany was anxious as to her access to sources of raw material, she was equally anxious about the conditions of transit from non-European countries to her own shores. So long as she is not mistress of the seas her commerce is exposed to attack en route; and in a world devoid of goodwill it is in constant peril. It would have been small use to her to extend her colonial possessions for the sake of acquiring supplies for her manufacturers if the communications between the colonies and their fatherland remained at the mercy of a stronger sea-power. It was by a perfectly logical chain o reasoning and modern German statemanship is nothing if not logical that Germany was driven to challenge the supremacy of the British Navy. As military power led on to economic power, so economic power led on to sea-power. It is true that British observers, looking at the matter from their own point of view, could not understand* Of the remainder, 28 percent, consisted of foodstuffs and cattle, which also account for over 10 percent, of the exports.t Harms &quot; Deutschlands Anteil am Welthandel und Weltschiffahrt,&quot; 1916, p. 103.X The Germau Colonial Office issued in 1914 a volume on Cotton-growing in the German Colonies, from which it appears that in the year 1912 German East Africa and Togoland, the two in which cultivation was most advanced, exported 130,000^. worth out of a total German import of 26.QO0.000Z. worth. The demand for a compact colonial empire that would satisfy in peace the German requirements in the way of raw products and would be able to hold its owu in war was put forward in a recent issue of the &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; in contrast to the larger &quot;Colonial War aims&quot; of the German Colonial League. (See the &apos;&apos; Manchester Guardian &quot; of the 10th January, 1916.)5 See, for instance, the very guarded and sketchy treatment of this subject in Gothein&apos;s fl Deutschlands Handel nach dem Kriege,&quot; p. 21, in other respects a most clear and well-arranged book, on the brief experience in the article by F. Zulenberg. &quot; Die neue Rundschiu,&quot; September 1916, p. 1155.I The Imperial Chancellors own phrase.
why Germany had any more justification than Holland or Norway for claiming that she needed a strong navy in order to protect her oversea communications. But it is just this very inability to put its own problems on a level with those of its neighbours which distinguishes the militarist temper. Here again Germany, pending the attain-ment of control on her own part, is thrown back quite logically upon the policy of demanding &quot; guarantees.&quot; Thus the claim for &quot; The Freedom of the Seas,&quot; however it may be interpreted in detail, is intimately bound up with the larger question of &quot; guarantees for peaceful development.&quot;Appended is a table of the chief German imports of raw material from non-European countries in 1913, together with the industries with which they are connected. For obvious reasons, the German Government has issued no later figures : 	Total	Position				Position in List of German Exports.Article.	Import iu Million Marks.	in List of German Imports.!

It is worth while adding that Germany is more acutely conscious of her dependence on oversea raw materials in industries with a large export trade than in those in which she works for the domestic market. * In the former case, even a temporary interruption may result in the loss of important connections, whereas in the latter case she can always be sure of safeguarding her market. Thus, although Germany is solely dependent on British India for jute, her vulnerability on this point is diminished by the fact that she exports. little in the way of jute manufactures. If she failed to obtain raw jute for a year she would import the necessary sacks and reorganise her domestic jute industry when the raw material was again available.The best commentary on the preceding figures and on the chain of argument set forth above is to be found in the numerous German books and pamphlets on economic subjects issued since the outbreak of the war. They are practically unanimous in attributing the war to the envy of England at Germany&quot; s rapid economic development, they then generally go on to lament the unheard-of &quot; brutality&quot; of the Allies, and especially England, in cutting Germany off from the world overseas and attempting to destroy her trade connexions, and to urge that Germany must secure such conditions in the peace terms as will enable her to wage the next war under more favourable economic conditions. One or two of them even go so far as to express mild astonish-ment at the slowness with which this pre-conceived economic programme was put into execution.! Perhaps the best illustration of this attitude is supplied by Professor Schumacher, the writer of the economic chapter in a two-volume composite professorial book on &quot; Germany and the World-War.&quot; At the close of a sober statement of Germany&apos;s pre-war economic position, he breaks into a passionate denunciation of British action with regard to German trading houses since the war, more especially in the Crown colonies. After giving particulars of the Straits Settlements :t Alien Enemies (Winding-up) Ordinance,&quot; he quotes with approval the statement of the President of the Bremen Chamber of Commerce that such&apos; procedure constituted &quot; the grossest perversion of justice which had occurred in civilised times,&quot; and that the British authorities had merely demonstrated to the world &quot;the break-up of all government.&quot; Such phrases sound odd on German lips, but their very exaggeration testifies to their sincerity, and to the fact that a sensitive nerve of German policy had been touched.^The Development of German Economic Organisation anal Opinion during the War.The German General Staff had not reckoned out all the implications of a war with Great Britain-if, indeed, they expected the intervention of Great Britain at all. The outbreak of the war found Germany as unprepared for the economic readjust-ments necessitated by a long-drawn conflict with the dominant sea-power as she was ready down to the last detail for the attack upon France through Belgium. This is clear from the most illuminating general account which is as yet available from German sources as to the economic side of German war-organisation. Dr. Walter B,athenau&apos;s published lecture on the organisation of the raw material section of the German War Office. Dr. Bathenau, the chairman of the Allgetneine Elektrizitatsgesellschaft. is one of the leading business men in Germany, and in close touch with governing circles. His description of the impression made on his mind by the British declaration of war, although obviously written for popular consumption, is worth quoting at some length: &quot; On the 4th August of last year,$ when England declared war, a terrible and unprecedented thing happened our country became a besieged fortress. Closed in by land and by sea, it was thrown upon its own resources, and a prospect of war opened out before us, boundless in time and expense, in danger and sacrifice.* This point is made in the War Office Raw Materials Section Memorandum on the control of certain raw materials by the Allied Governments after the war, p. 33.f On this point see &quot;Das Deutsche Wirtschaflsleben im Kriege,&quot; by Gustav Stresernann, a well-known National Liberal member of the Reichstag, pp. 30-32. He states that the German exports for the last six months of 1914 from some dL-tricts exceeded the figures for the last half of 1913, as, for instance, those from Chemnitz, a textile centre, adding, with a touch of bravado, &quot; there&apos; is no doubt that our export trade to enemy countries, particularly England, could have been maintained in numerous articles if it had not been sharply forbidden on military and other grounds.&quot; He also mentions the large import of American cotton at that time in exchange for dyes, which took place as the result of the energetic pressure of the American upon the British Government, adding that the arrangement was useful to Germany &quot;not only in disposing of a portion of our exports, but in enabling us to provide ourselves with raw material.&quot; The same subject is more discreetly referred to by Dr. Katheimu, the first head of the Raw Materials Department of the German War Office in a, published lecture referred to below.% &quot; Deutschland und der Weltkrieg,&quot; vol. i, pp. 150, 151.$ The lecture was delivered on the 20th December, 19&quot;t5, but not published till the autumn of 1916. F899-23] C
&quot; Three days after the declaration of war I could bear the uncertainty as to out position no longer. I asked for an interview with the head of the General War Department, Colonel Scheucb, and was kindly received by him in the evening of the 8th August. I explained to him that our country could presumably only be provided for a limited number of months with the indispensable materials for carrying on war. His estimate as to the duration of the war was as considerable as mine, so I had to ask him the question, &apos; What has been done, what can be done to avert the danger of the throttling of Germany ?&apos; Very little had been done. But a great deal was to be done, for the interest was aroused. When I returned home, anxious and lull of foreboding, I found a telegram from the War Minister, Von Falkenhayn, inviting me to an interview next morning.&quot;The result of that interview was the formation of the Raw Materials Department of the German War Office, of which for the first eight months Dr. Rathenau was the head. It was entrusted with full power to deal with &quot;materials of service in the defence of the country, which cannot he secured permanent^ or in sufficient quantity within its borders.&quot; Foodstuffs and all forms of liquid fuel were excluded, but other-wise the Department was allowed full scope. More than a dozen materials were at once recognised as requiring to be dealt with, but the number eventually reached over a hundred.Only four lines of action, we are told, were open to the Department: ]. The requisitioning of all the materials of the kind in the country.2. [Here follows a blank in the lecture. We are clearly meant to infer* the findingof ways and means for procuring material from abroad and from the occupiedterritories.]3. The development of home supplies and methods of production. 4. The discovery of substitutes and the replacement of one material by another easier to obtain where compatible with efficiency.This programme involved nothing less than &quot;the transformation of German industry.&quot; The reorganisation undertaken by the Raw Materials Department involved two stages: the assumption of control over the commodities in question, and the creation of an organisation to deal with these when controlled.The first stage resembled, but on a far larger scale, the arrangements with which we are familiar in the case of the &quot;controlled establishments&quot; of this country, as fixed by the Defence of the Realm and Munition Acts. Dr. Rathenau describes it as an application to new conditions of the old military conception of &quot; requisition&quot; or &quot; embargo&quot;(&quot; Beschlagnahme &quot;). Instead of the military taking possession of the property in question, it remains in the hands of the existing owner, but its use is limited and controlled by higher authority. The working of the system is best described in the War Trade Intelligence Departments monograph on &quot; Rationing in Enemy Countries,&quot; in a passage which well illustrates how relatively, easy it was to establish such a system among a people already familiar with the workings of &quot; military necessity &quot; in connection with private property : f&quot; The effect of the imposition of an embargo upon goods is to convert the present holder into a trustee of the goods for the public authority which is to control them ; and all disposition over them is prohibited except acts, necessary for their preservation or which bring them into the possession of the authority or its agents, or of the consumer for whom they are intended. The power of requisitioning remains in the background, to be exercised only if the owner does not voluntarily - offer the goods to the authority or sell them at its demand.&quot;* Confirmation is supplied, if needed, by an article in the &quot; Zeitschrift fUr technischen Fortschritt&quot; for September 1916, p. 385, which enumerates the four lines of action, and interprets the second in the above sense.f It is clear from Rathenau that many of the owners were expecting much more drastic measures. He says that &quot; confiscation &quot; of all the stocks required was constantly urged upon him; and he explains at some length why it would not have been practicable. Compare the following characteristic passage from the cross-examiuation of a War Office witness before Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee : &quot; Q. In the event of the producer, not thinking the price which he is offered by the Government sufficient, because he thinks he can get a better price, what is to be his position ? A. We presuppose that the system of export prohibitions will remain.&quot; Q. Are you not in effect proposing to penalise the individual for the public good ?-A. Certainly.&quot; Q. And that in peace-time ? A. Certainly.&quot; Q. You would not go so far with me as this, would you that the producer, if he felt he was getting less than what is called the world&apos;s price from his own Government, would have a very real and tangible grievance ? A. No, 1 am afraid I cannot agree to that.&apos;: Q. You would not go so far as that ? A. No.&quot;
The good? being thus &quot; under control &quot; it was necessary to devise an organisation to deal with them. The method adopted by Dr. Rathenau differed in important respects from that adopted in the case of foodstuffs, and was, as he claims: no doubt with pardonable exaggeration, so successful that, as he puts it, &quot;the German people is still to-day&quot; (ie., December 1015) &quot;in the habit of thinking that raw materials come upon the scene by themselves. People talk about the food problem morning, noon, and night, but no attention at all is paid to the raw materials question. &quot; The control of food, on the other hand, was ie&apos;t by the entire population as consumers, and also affected the activities of a very large number of independent producers and-competing middlemen. So many-private interests were involved that the need for strict control was found by experience to be imperative, and it was decided that dealings should only be carried on through accredited agents of the authorities.&quot; It has been repeatedly laid down in principle that in appointing such agents care shall be taken to preserve existing trade connections, but in practice this has oroved impossible. The embargo has always meant the severance of such ties and the employment of fewer and often strange, dealers to buy for the authorities. &quot;*In the case of raw. materials, on the other hand, the problem was both simpler and more complicated : simpler because fewer private interests were involved, and the general public less immediately affected; more complicated because of the greater technical know-ledge involved in its handling. Dr. Rathenau therefore decided not to set up a Govern-ment Department to deal with each important raw material a Wool Office, a Chemicals Office, a Rubber Office, similar to the Imperial Potato Office or the Imperial Office of Fruit and Vegetables, but to work through existing trade channels and to devise a new term of organisation inside each of the industries themselves. Thus it was that the so-called war economic companies came into existence.A war economic company is a half-waj^ house between State Socialism and private enterprise, and between self-government and central control, &quot;a form of economic structure,&quot; as Dr. Rathenau remarks, &quot; which ma)&apos;-be prophetic of future developments.&quot; It is granted by the State a monopoly in the commodity with, which it is concerned, but under strict control by the State authorities. Representative.-, from the various executive authorities and ministries have an unlimited veto on its activities. The companies do not work for profit, any surplus above 5 per cent, on the capital subscribed or left over on liquidation being devoted to public purposes. Their administration is partly in the. hands of an ordinary directorate and shareholders&apos; meeting (apparently retained more or less as a matter of form), and partly of an independent; commission, consisting of officials and representatives of chambers of commerce. This last body is responsible, we are told, for the fixing of prices, which presumably includes the whole question of purchase and the distribution of the commodity among manufacturers.The organisation promoted on these lines was carried through with great rapidity, though not without opposition from the interests concerned. The metal industry fell in more or less willingly, but the chemical manufacturers did not give their assent we learn, &quot;till after a scene recalling the famous meeting in tin; tennis court at Paris in 1789.&quot; Then followed jute, wool, worsted, rubber, cotton, leather, hides, flax, linen, horsehair, not all involving actual companies, as in some cases stock-taking offices (&quot; Abrechnungsstellen &quot;) were considered sufficient: &quot; By the spring of 1915, when General von Falkenhayn returned to Berlin, and enquired into the working of the Department, I was able to tell him,&quot; says Dr. Rathenau, &quot; that we were safeguarded in all material respects; so far as raw materials are concerned, the war can go on indefinitely.&quot;!* &quot; W.T.I.D.&quot; p. 54. The Central War Food Ministry, however, changed iis policy at the end of 1916 and, is urging the local authorities to make their own contracts, as centralised action has not proved a success.f This of course must not be taken too literally. But it will be aoeepred as a true statement of what the Department was aiming at. It has since been severely criticised in some quarters for not conceiving its functions to be offensive as well as defensive. See the interesting pamphlet &quot; Das falsche System und die Jagdnach deoi Sundenbocken? (the wrong system and the hunt for a scapegoat), by Arthur S. Wertheim (Berlin, 1916). The writer is representative of the business element which tsid not find a place on the War Company governing bodies, and from internal evidence probably a Jew. II.- declares that very early in the war he realised that &quot; one of the most important industries of all our enemies was almost eutirely dependent upon the supply of a certain raw material from a neighbouring neutral country always accessible to us.&quot; Re urged the Government to buy up the complete supply for two years, and was able to say that the necessary preparations had already been made. The project was opposed by the representatives of certain private interests and was rejected by the Government, not apparently ok the &quot;ground that the proposal itself was impracticable, but on the general ground of objectiou to this line of policy. Possibly the German Government was afraid of suggesting to this country the idea of reprisals in kind.
No exact information is available as to the number of commodities that have been thus controlled, but the number is. constantly being added to and must be very large. In the case of foodstuffs the control of one article inevitably creates an excessive demand for others and thus control is extended, snowball fashion, by its own momentum. The best recent general summary of the present German economic organisation is, perhaps, that of Mr. Swope, the correspondent of the &quot;New York World,&quot; in its issue of the 10th November, 1916 : &quot;The main point, he writes, &quot;in Germany&apos;s present system is readiness to meet her immediate emergencies and those of an internal nature arising after the war. She has created state-controlled purchasing and distributing bureaus. There are &apos; Central Einkauf-Buros &apos; and distributing bureaus for grain, milk, eggs, butter, meat, fish and other edibles, and for wool, cotton, metals, leather, oils, and the other great raw staples. The food bureaus will end with the end of the war,* but Governmental buying of the raw stuffs, it is expected, will be continued for as long a time as the system proves efficient, which will be until the method threatens to stifle individual initiative. Everyone with whom I spoke in Germany believes that at least some of the things in the present regulation will be continued, the benefits are so great.&quot; These central purchasing bureaus of the Empire are a through-going example of the highly organised conditions existing to-day. Every plant using any of the great raw staples is recorded in the district bureau, where the reason for the plant&apos;s existence must be given that is, it must be shown that the plant is engaged in manufactures needed for military or commercial purposes. The factories show their advance orders to the divisional chiefs and receive an allotment of the raw stuffs. The needs of the Empire are lumped and the &apos; Central Buro &apos; in Berlin divides the supply according to these allotments. If the supply on hand is sufficient, no extra purchases are made ; but if the immediate needs threaten to pull the reserves below a certain point, new purchases are made in the accessible foreign markets ; or it no supply is available, the distribution is curtailed on proportionate bases.&quot; Many of the big industrialists of German)&apos;- with whom I spoke believe that this system can be profitably continued after peace. They see in the method a means of regulating prices through their enormous purchasing power. For example, if all the copper, amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds, that Germany needs annually were to brought by one bureau, the magnitude of the operation would be such as to enable it, in effsct, to dictate the price it would be willing to pay. It may be noted that this system is substantially that employed by the Allies now, as evidenced by the recent order of 500,000,000 pounds which was placed in the American market.&quot; The question of continuing this method, and the other economic questions that will arise after peace comes, are to be handled by an Imperial Transition Commission. This commission will not only deal with the industrial and economic situation, but will also be required to solve the financial problems that Germany must face.&quot;This policy of centralised administration and organisation was so successful at first that the idea embodied in it took firm root in wide sections of public opinion, and during 1915 -/syndication&quot; was one of the cries of the hour. The &quot;Christian Socialist&quot; leader, Dr. Naumann, who is not only a writer of great charm and ability, but a sensitive barometer of public opinion, descants at length upon the subject of State-controlled monopolies in his &quot; Mitteleuropa,&quot; written in the summer of 1915, and another very suggestive and influential writer, Professor Jaffe, of Munich, coined the phrase &quot; the militarism of industry,&quot; and boldly proclaimed Germany as the land of &quot; industrial militarism.&quot;!&apos; His line of thought is so suggestive that it is worth quoting, as an illustration of the influence of war conditions in German economic ideas : &quot;Whatever the result of the present war,&quot; Jaffe argues, &quot;we shall be exposed to serious economic dangers on its conclusion, and shall need to reorganise* This has since been contradicted in a speech by the Under-Secretary for the Interior, who pointed out that rationing must of necessity continue for some time after the conclusion of hostilities.t In &quot; Volkswirthschaft und Krieg,&quot; Tubingen, 1915, and an article on &quot;The Mobilisation of our Industrial Life,&quot; in the course of which he pleads, oddly enough, for the introduction of the democratic principle of workshop committees, as a safety-valve, in these militarised establishments X&quot; Arch. fur. JSozial-wissenschaft,&quot; vol. xl, pp. 511/&apos;). The account of Jaffe&apos;s views in the text is taken from a summary in Conrad&apos;s &quot; JahrbUcher &apos; for October 1915, p. 527. .
our industrial life. The principle of free competition is no longer sufficient: we must - set our industrial life on a new bas*is. The free economic system imported into Germany a hundred years ago from England, with the consequent break-up of the economic life of the community into competing atoms has already been limited in &apos; various ways, by social legislation, associations of employers, trade unions, &amp;c. All these portended the elimination of the principle of economic freedom, though people have been slow to realise the fact. The true goal of Germany&apos;s economic system is a perfected economic organisation in which all sections of the people are joined together in an organic unity, and in which the individual does not work for his own private purpose, but is the servant of the community. Men will no longer ask &apos; How much shall T make ?&apos; but &apos; What can I do ?&apos; and capitalism, as we know it, will be a thing of the past.&quot;Views of this kind are not exceptional, and they are worth quoting both because of their practical applications to German post-war policy, and because of the &quot;new orientation&quot; of public opinion (to use the Chancellors expression) which they represent.To come first to their practical applications. We find in Jaffe, as in every other writer who handles the subject, a realisation of the very serious economic situation which will confront Germany at the end of the war. If Germany, as all her writers and speakers have been saying, has discovered her real soul and her true principle of organisation through the war, she must embody this principle in her post-war mode of life. If she has been able to stand in shining armour to face a world in arms, she must not lay aside this &quot; militarism &quot; on the return of peace. On the contrary, she must &quot; militarise &quot; her economic life in the face of a world that will still be envious and hostile. She must look forward to a &quot; war after the war,&quot; in which victory will once more go to the best organised nation. Difficult as it may seem at first sight, Germany must organise her trade, as she has organised her army. Trade must become &quot; an integral part of foreign policy.&quot; The old methods of laissez-faire and individual competition may be appropriate for small States; &quot;a world-Empire, such as we may hope Germany will emerge out of the war, must apply other methods.&apos;&apos;^The practical outcome of such reflections is twofold. In the first place, Germany must aim at emerging from the war a self-sufficient Empire independent of sea com-munications. Jafie himself looks forward to a close economic union between Germany and her allies, and the winning of &quot; a great unified Central African Empire, that will keep us supplied with the necessary raw materials and be in a position to defend itself in time of war.&quot; Other writers, more modest in their expectations, hint at the annexation of &quot; certain regions of North-East Africa in immediate contiguity with the territory of our allies.&quot; In any case, the idea of the &quot; self-dependent commercial unit (&quot; geschlossener Handelsstaat&quot;) acquired an immense vogue as a first result of the blockade and the eastern campaign of 1915, and attention was concentrated on the economic possibilities of the Near East, with results that will be considered shortly.In the second place, the idea of the industrial Julius Tower cime into prominence. The Julius Tower is the name of the fortress at Spandau where a portion of the war indemnity of 1871 was laid up against the next war. There seems to be a general agreement that the blockade has shown that German3^ had been &quot; incredibly care-free,&quot; as one writer put it,f in not laying up stores of indispensable foodstuffs and raw materials against the event of a lengthy war, and that a fixed minimum supply must in future always be kept in hand, if not in State-owned ships, at least under State controhjAll these ideas, it will have been remarked, are socialistic in character ; and this fact has not been lost either on the Socialists or on their old political opponents. The fact that one of the first effects of the war was to strengthen the power of the State as against private &quot;capitalist&quot; enterprise did much to confirm the unprecedented union of classes which the outbreak of the war called forth. The close association that has subsisted throughout the war between the moderate school of official opinion and the Socialist majority, typified in the close personal relation between the Imperial Chancellor and the Majority leader, Herr Scheidemann, will most surprise those who know best how deep and impassable was the social and political gulf between Socialists* CouracVs &quot; Jahrbiicher,&quot; article cited above.t Paul Arndt, &quot; Deutschland und der Weltmarkt,&quot; Teubner, 1916, p. 45.t According to a writer in the &quot; Europiiische Zeitung,&quot; p. 1111, the idea of the Julius Tower was originated by Jaffe&apos; soon after the outbreak of the war.[899-23] D
and the &quot; bourgeois &quot; parties before the war. This new union has been typified in many ways, such as the production of a composite book of essays by leading State professors and prominent working-class leaders (an incredible occurrence before 1914). edited by the librarian of the Prussian House of Lords, but not least by the open espousal of socialist opinions or, at any rate, socialist phraseology by leaders of academic thought. In reality, of course, though the change of attitude may seem striking, the fundamental change of opinion involved is inconsiderable. Between the Marxian doctrines of theorthodox &quot; German Socialist and the militarist doctrines of the orthodox German official class there is very little to choose. Each believes in &quot; the materialistic conception of history,&quot; in the inevitable struggle of rival economic organisations for ascendancy, and in the validity of force as a criterion of success. The German worker, like the German manufacturer, was seeking his place in the sun: and it was not difficult, in an emergency which created a fund of common feeling, to make each feel that the place which the Government fixed as the goal of the nations striving was the place of their dreams. It may safely be predicted that whatever -annexations the German Government may be able to secure, as a result of the war, whether in actual territory or in spheres of economic influence, will be accepted by the main body of the Socialist party and electorate without reference to humanitarian or nationalist considerations. The attitude of the thinking Socialist workman can, perhaps, - best be illustrated by the following extract from the concluding article of a book of essays, published in 1915 by leading trade unionists, on &quot; Working-class Interests, and the Issue of the War&quot; (pp. 160-1). The writer, Herr Wilhehn Jansson, is the editor of the official organ of the German Trade Union movement: &quot; We Trade Unionists are not naive enough to regard pacifist dreams ofuniversal brotherhood as a reality in the era of capitalism.....Karl Marxseems to us a better guide than the French and English trumpeters against &quot; Prussian militarism &quot; not to mention their allies. And from Marx we know that wars are caused by conflicts of economic interests. So long as these conflicts of interest continue, we shall have to reckon with the scourge of war. But we believe that a victorious Germany could do a great deal to abate these conflicts of interest if she pursued a prudent policy at once consonant with her own interests and acceptable to those of o&apos;ther nations. The larger the number of nations which Germany can draw into her sphere of interest by this peaceful economic means, the fewer will be the points of friction in Europe, and the less fruitful the eventual efforts of the disturbers of the peace. A League of Peace, from Lule-Eli* to the Persian Gulf, seems certainly an economic project capable of realisation within the near future. After all, a beginning must be made somewhere. Germany has the capacity for organisation, and it is in a position to offer economic advantages to the other nations, without endangering its own interests.&quot;And a few pages earlier, dealing with the projects for realising the principle of nationality in Eastern Europe, he remarks (p. 192): &quot; The breaking-off of the territories demanded by the Western Powers, which they desire to share with the &apos; Czar of Liberty,&apos; would by itself be a death-blow to German industr)r. For it is from these regions that we draw our most important raw materials, coal and mineral ore, which are the necessary condition for Germany&apos;s successful industrial competition in the markets of the world, it is owing to them that German industry has attained a world-wide position, that Germany has become one of the workshops of the world. The achievements of our own Trade Union movemet rest upon the same basis. If these regions with their industrial workers numbering hundreds of thousands or even millions, are separated from Germany, what remains of German industry will rapidly decline, and the German Trade Union movement would have lost its importance.&quot;One could hardly have a better example of the close inner kinship of militarism and materialism ; and the same point of view will be found in all the writings of the Socialist majority on questions of East European or colonial expansion. The wishes and welfare of the inhabitants, if mentioned at all, are subordinated to the consideration of how the wealth of the territory in question may be made serviceable to the German workman.. So far we have dealt with the methods adopted to set German economic life on a war basis, and with the changes in opinion which resulted from their operations, the* In Northern Sweden.
pride in German powers of organisation, the demonstration of State Socialism in practice, and the hopes of large new extensions of German economic influence in the Near East. But there is another side to the picture, and has the war has gone on it has become increasingly prominent, and is likely to be equally, if not more, conspicuous in the post-war period. It shows itself in a reaction against the present system in ways that are difficult to define, but can be traced in the altered tone of the literature daring the past year. It would be too much to say that there are indications that public opinion is rebellious, but it is certainly restive and uncomfortable, and has lost its cherished belief in the infallibility of the State authorities. It is in the condition uf mind which German writers describe as &quot; war weariness.&quot;It must be remembered that Germany is at present, and nas been for many months, living in a state of siege, which affects every household and every business in the country. Not only has the whole economic organisation passed bit by bit under the control of the State, but the military authorities are in a position to bring immediate pressure to bear on individuals and firms through their control of man-power, which has lately been increased, though not without significant protests by the Reichstag, by the Auxiliary Patriotic Service Lav/, rendering all males liable to service between 16 and 60. The authorities, in fact, dole out not only rations of raw material, but rations of labour; and this control is increasing in stringency in proportion as native labour is replaced by prisoners and imported Belgians, French, Poles, and others. This situation has produced several results, which have had their effect in turn upon upon public opinion.For one thing, State control has fallen with especial severity on the lower middle classes, the small independent shopkeepers and handicraftsmen, of whom, in an only semi-industrialised country like Germany, there were still so many on the outbreak of war. Many thousands of small or &quot;one-man&quot; businesses have been closed and their proprietors are now working for wages. So severely has this class suffered that already a year ago ITindenburg thought it necessary to address a public appeal to the Chancellor in their interest, and an important debate took place in the Prussian Diet on the same point.The same is true in a lesser degree of larger businesses in all except war industries,^ and even there the constitution of the war companies has inevitably favoured the larger firms as against those which were not so well known. Mercantile as opposed to manufacturers&apos; interests have suffered particularly, partly owing to the blockade and partly because of the elimination of competition through the centralisation of purchasing. Thus there is a very powerful and growing bodj^ of interests ill-disposed towards the existing regime of State control, and anxious for its discontinuance at the earliest possible moment after the war. These views are represented by associations of import houses, founded in the first half of 1916 at Hamburg, Bremen, and Berlin, and also by a memorandum issued by the Berlin Chamber of Commerce.!Again, the extension of control by the central authority has been resented by the State Governments, which have found themselves shorn of their power, guaranteed them under the Constitution, to deal with social and economic problems within their own areas. The result has been a revival of what in Germany is known as &quot;particularism,&quot; which has been very marked in the controversies on the food question. Voices are already being raised loudly demanding that the interests of the South German States shall not be forgotten in the arrangements made for the transition period after the war.JFinally, the all-absorbing food question itself has strengthened the reaction against State control, and the desire for a life free from vexatious regulation. The. Central Purchasing Company, which is entrusted with the buying up of supplies, seems, by all accounts, to be the best-hated body in the country, both among consumers and producers,^ while the vicissitudes of the Imperial Food Office, in the face of a problem the full difficulty of which it was in honour bound to conceal, have done much to diminish the* See, for instance, Daily Notes, 11th January, 1917, on the effect of Patriotic Auxiliary Service on the Leipzig Fair..   f W.T.I.D.

It is intelligible that every official limitation in the free economic activities of individuals and every monopolising of a fixed . economic sphere should call forth the opposition of the interests affected But the strong feeling against the War Economic Companies goes farbeyond the circle of those personally interested. One can hardly take up a newspaper without seeing some- attack on War Economic Companies in general and especially against the greatest of them all, the Central Purchasing Company.&quot;
prestige of German officialdom. Among the mingled elements which go to make up the average Germans undeniable desire for peace, the wish for a comfortable life;cue civeiago vjmuni u ^tfv*vtJi^^--    .organised on nq matter how old-fashioned lines, must take a large place.Coupled with all this is a marked disulusionment regarding the immediate practical value of Germany:s conquests in Eastern Europe. The chief conquest, it is often said, which Germany has made in the war is the conquest of her allies; and certainly there is no doubt that the events of 1915 the occupation of Poland and Courland, the break-through to the Balkans, and the establishment of a virtual German, hegemony over a vast area of Eastern Europe and Western Asia made an immense imprefesion upon the German mind. It at once dispelled the &quot;Russian terror,&quot; which was still alive in large sections of the population, and spread a sense of pride and confidence in Germany&apos;s &quot;Imperial&quot; destiny, a feeling which has been fostered by every means at the disposal of the authorities. But as the months went on and the blockade became tighter people began to look into the new Empire more closely, and the result was discouraging. It was only too apparent that no possible extension of German influence south-eastwards could meet Germany&apos;s chief economic needs or compensate her for being cut off from intercourse with her present enemies ; that, in fact, the idea of a &quot; self-sufficient German Empire &quot; is, so far as present prospects go, a mere dream. The result is that German writers on these subjects in recent months, acting, one may suppose, on general instructions from headquarters, have done their utmost to keep in check the exaggerated estimates that had been formed as to the value of &quot; Mitteleuropa,&quot; both as a source of raw material and food, and as a market for German goods. The position as regards raw materials is best set forth in the following table from an article by Dr. von Tyska, of Berlin, in the &quot; Europaische Staats-und Wirtschaftszeitung&quot; for the 20th April, 1916 a paper, be it noted, especially founded to deal with &quot; Mitteleuropa &quot; questions.The Share of &quot; Mittkleuropa &quot; (i.e., Austria-Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Turkey) in supplying Germany with Industrial Raw Materials in 1913.Article.Import into Germany in Thousands of Marks.Total Import.Import from &quot; Mitteleuropa.&quot;Percentage from &quot; Mitteleuropa.&quot;Cotton ..

The article in question concludes with an expression of opinion which is repeated in substance by writer after writer on the subject :-&quot; The most important thing is, and remains, that Germany must keep a free hand, and be put in a position to carry through far-reaching connections with the business of the whole world. She must not hang &apos; Mitteleuropa,&apos; like a weight of lead, to her feet, to retard her progress in dealing with the outer world (&apos; welt-wirfhschaftliches Vorwartskommen &apos;); on the contrary, she must discover a method which will make possible an economic rapprochement with those countries, without piejudiee to her economic position in the world as a whole.&quot;The same conclusion is reached in the most careful study that has as yet appeared on tne subject: the two-volume composite work on .&quot; The Economic Rapprochement
between Germany and her Allies.&quot; edited on behalf of the &quot; Verein fiir Sozialpolitik &quot; by Professor Herkner, of Berlin. The change of feeling about &quot; Mitteleuropa &quot; is thus described at the close of a lengthy notice of books and pamphlets on the subject in the &quot; Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv,&quot; published in October 1916, but dated the 25th July&quot; If we take a closing survey of the 3,000 pages of &apos; Mitteleuropa&apos; literature noted in these columns, we cannot fail to be conscious of a great development and clarification in the views set forth. At first the question was approached from a purely political point of view and with a definite programme. Enthusiasm was the predominant note, and military, political, and sentimental factors seemed to lead up naturally to the closest possible association between the two States (i.e., Germany and Austria-Hungary) in the economic field. Purely economic considerations were taken for granted, or only regarded as deserving of superficial mention. . This phase reached its high-water mark in Naumanns book, which is written entirely under the influence of this feeling, yet at the same time did much to promote deeper reflection on the subject and introduced many new ideas, too, on the economic side.   Since then a lively discussion has been kept up.&quot; Closer inspection led to an increase of scepticism. Men&apos;s minds came down to solid earth and attention began to be concentrated on the concrete problems involved. When it came to thinking out a definite policy for the future, doubts multiplied; all the more so when the discussion passed from the purely political students who had hitherto been heard on the subject to the economic experts. The high-water mark of this second phase in the discussion is marked by the two volumes of the &apos; Verein fur Sozialpolitik,&apos;0 in which criticism and the careful weighing of pros and cons are conspicuous. Press discussions reflect the same change of tone ; the essays of Arthur Feiler in the &apos; Frankfurter Zeitung&apos; in June are characteristic examples. On the German side even more than on the Austro-Hungarian more and more water has been poured into the wine of &apos; economic union.&apos; So far as one can see, this critical action is justified. After all, economic policy is not a matter of sentiment, and in Germany&apos;s future relations with Austria-Hungary the politico-military alliance will have to be considered separately from economic interests, as in no other way can chronic friction and conflicts be avoided. It is a natural development, such as we have experienced in other fields the passage from Utopia to Reality.&quot;The situation here adumbrated, with the mention of &quot; chronic friction and conflicts,&quot;&apos; is further elucidated in a penetrating article which appeared in the &quot;Archiv fur Sozial-wissenschaft und Sozialpolitik&quot; for December 1916. The writer points out (p. 582) that, so far from &quot; Mitteleuropa &quot; being likely to become a single economic unit, this has not even been possible in the Dual Monarchy itself, which is in a permanent state of economic war between its two halves or among its component nationalities, for whom &quot;every profession, every undertaking, every factory is a scene of conflict, in which savings banks, co-operative societies, and the like are the weapons wielded in the Nationalist cause.&quot; In other words, if &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; is to become, in Professor Jaffes phrase quoted above, &quot; a perfected economic organisation in which all sections of the people are joined together in an organic unity,&quot; it can only be by the suppression of the natural and reasonable aspirations of the non-German nationalities, who are to be the hewers of wood and drawers of water (producers of agricultural produce and industrial raw materials) for the German manufacturer and working man.The Germans in fact regard their south-eastern neighbours as an economic proletariat, just as the Americans so regard them when they emigrate to the United States; and not all the fine phrases about the &quot; spread of Kultur &quot; can alter this fundamental fact. If the &quot; Mitteleuropa&quot; of Naumann&apos;s dreams should ever come into existence it will be a &quot; Slave-State.&quot; on a gigantic scale. Indeed it may be said that Naumann&apos;s chapter on &quot; the Central European economic man&quot; is the most attractive exposition of the Servile State since the abolition of legal slavery.The less sanguine view about German economic prospects in the south-east is further confirmed from a study of the transport problems involved in the economic linking-up of that region with Germany. From the military point of view, Germany&apos;s railway connections within the Near East have been of inestimable advantage; but from the point of view of the cheap conveyance of goods in peace-time the sea-route is indispensable to her. Here again she is driven back on to the question of the security of her communications, in other words, &quot; the freedom of her seas.&quot;  Meanwhile,* Referred to above, they deal with Bulgaria and Turkey as well as with Austria-Hunsrary.[899-23] E
however, there is no one means by which her dependence upon sea-traffic may be, if not avoided, at least considerably reduced the development of the inland waterways of Central and Eastern Europe. This is a subject which has been very widely discussed, and the &quot; Maas-Memel-Maritza&quot; project has come to rank beside &quot; Berlin-Bagdad.&quot; In this connection the following extract from an article by Professor Herkner, of Berlin, the editor of the book just mentioned is significant. After stating that he Is in general not disposed to favour preferential tariff rates between Germany and Austria he adds : &quot; I would, however, regard preferential duties in favour of inland shipping as well worthy of consideration. Germany and Austria could reduce the duties on specific goods, provided they were imported by the Danube, the Elbe, or the Oder-Danube canal, so as to meet the competition of sea-borne goods. This would no more constitute an infringement of the most-favoured-nation clause than the differential rates with which Austria-Hungary favours imports via Trieste and Fiume. Let us imagine for ourselves the completion of a thoroughly satisfactory up-to-date means of communication between the Danube and the Main. This would lead to an extraordinary improvement in the situation of Bavaria. * But the improvement would also affect Germany as a whole. It is dangerous for us that most of our large centres of industry (the Lower Rhine, Lorraine, Silesia) lie near the border. Since the South-East of Germany is one of the securest parts of the country, the development of new industrial centres in this region would be a matter for congratulation.&quot;We are justified then, on the facts, in concluding that German post-war plans neither contemplate an indefinite continuance of State-controlled commerce and industry nor an attempt to work out a policy of isolation and self-sufficiency for Germany and her allies. Germany may before the war have harboured the idea of conquering a self-sufficient empire; and the idea has still great attractions for her, for she dislikes to be in any way dependent upon the goodwill of outsiders. But with her failure to shake the foundations of the British, French, Belgian, or Portuguese colonial empires it has perforce been relegated to an indefinite future. She is not at present economically strong enough to stand alone. She is, as one recent writer has been bold enough to call her, &quot; the greatest among the weaker nations.&quot; As such she is forced-back into the well-worn path of international trading relations with the world at large. She has (to repeat the expression cited above) to discover a method of harmonising her intimate relations with her allies with her need for unrestricted intercourse with present neutrals and enemies ; and to discover also a method for safeguarding that intercourse from interruption in a world devoid of goodwill.It needs no great familiarity with the logical process of German thinking to discover the practical course to which this German policy is being driven. What cannot be won by the sword must be secured by statemanship. German)&apos;- will attempt to acquire in the terms of peace the advantages which she has failed to acquire in the war, and she will attempt to safeguard them by the only &quot; guarantee&quot; that is at all worthy to be set beside that of her own arms, the guarantee of the signatory Powers, backed up, in case of need, by military force.We are now in a position to examine more in detail what is known about Germany&apos;s post-war plans.   We shall best do so under two heads :  1. What sort of peace terms will Germany put forward and hope to obtain ? 2. What actual preparations has she made on her side for the coming of peace ?Terms of Peace.There is unanimity among all the German writers whose statements on the subject are available that the terms of peace must be such as to safeguard Germany from the policy of the Paris Conference.It is fully recognised that even under the most favourable diplomatic and legal arrangements German trade will suffer through the unwillingness of individual customers to handle German goods; but the German writers rely on the skill and inventiveness of their scientists, the technical training of their workmen, and the &quot;quality of their goods, to break this barrier down. The great German export industries, iron and steel, dyes, chemicals, electrical machinery, &amp;c, have been built up, we are* The quotation is taken from the &quot; Europaische Staats- und Wirtschafts-Zeitung,&quot; No. 15, a paper published in Munich.
constantly reminded, by the German system of education and cannot be replaced in a few years. On this theme even the wildest opponents of England, such as the National Liberal leader, Dr. Stresemann, are ready to sing the praises of international intercourse and to preach the much criticised doctrine of &quot;business as usual.&quot; As he truly remarks, people did not buy German goods before the war out of love for Germany; and it is quality and price, not sentiment, which are the determining factors in the long run. All that Germany demands is a fair field and no favour. What is meant by this ?The following rough outline of the German peace terms on the economic side is an attempt to crystallise, in brief form, the substance of the available literature on the subject. The most explicit statement is to be found in a pamphlet by Herr Gothein, a well-known Radical member of the Reichstag. * It will be observed that the terms are framed with a fourfold object: (1.) To leave Germany a free hand in the economic exploitation of &quot; Mitteleuropa,&quot; where she will be politically supreme, whilst at the same time preserving her complete freedom of action in the outer world ;(2.) To leave Germany a free hand to develop her own characteristic methods of economic penetration and aggression, whilst tying the hands of her present enemies from pursuing the counter-measures of their own choosing, and enforcing the prohibition by an international guarantee, i.e., by the threat of military force;(3.) To appeal to the sympathy of the neutral world ; and, in particular  (4.) To use the growing volume of opinion in favour of the extension of international action so as to make it further her own purposes.1. The freedom of the seas :An immense amount of verbiage surrounds the discussion of this question. What Germany appears to desire is: (a.) In the event of being itself at war, to be free to conduct her ordinary trade in neutral bottoms, i.e., she will demand the immunity of neutral shipping from visit and search. It is doubtful whether she will demand immunity for enemy private property in general, Le., for enemy shipping, as the develop-ment of the submarine has thrown new light on the bearing of this question on the activities of the weaker naval Power. It is, however, difficult to interpret the German utterances on this point.(6.) In the event of being neutral during the war, to be immune from the losses and inconvenience suffered by neutrals in the present war.(c.) In the peace time, to be assured against the arbitrary exercise of sea-power, especially as regards the control of vital arteries of world-communication. She would probably seek to put forward demands for the internationalisation of the Suez Canal, Gibraltar, and, in certain eventualities, the Dardanelles.The more serious writers, however, appear to attach comparatively little importance to the claim for the freedom of the seas, which is recognised to be of only academic importance in the post-war period.   Far more important is 2. The demand for the Most-Favoured-Nation treatment in perpetuity, or over a long term of years, between Germany (some writers add Germany&apos;s allies) and her present enemies, on the model of the similar provision in the Treaty of Frankfort. All disputes as to the working of the Most-Favoured-Nation clause to be referred to an international tribunal.This would appear to debar Germany from granting special tariff privileges to her present allies. This point has not been overlooked.
