A.B.15Q/8.AIR BOARD. REPORT TO THE CaBIM?.24 th March, 1917.GeneralPolicy. 1.     The Bbard haire had &quot;before them the first fore-cast of the Controller of Aeronautical Supplies as to the output of engines and aeroplanes during the period 1st March to 30th June, 1917.     The figures as regards engines are concurred in by the Controller of Petrol Engines.   The forecast may be summarised as follows:-Army re-   Imvy re- Total.     EstimatedQuirements. quirements. Deliveries.Engines        4445 1735 3181 3396Aeroplanes   4832 948 5780 3721For the purpose of comparing the future deliveries of engines with the deliveries in previous months, the figure of 497, representing certain sea-plane engines ordered by the Admiralty, should he added to the figure 3396 given above.     This gives an average delivery per month of 973, as compared with the actual deliveries during January and February of 825, or an improvement of about 150 per month.The estimated average deliveries of aeroplanes per month amount to 950 as compared with the actual deliveries during the last fr&quot;o months of 370. The estimated engine deliveries, ^hen examined in detail, are not so unsatisfactory as might at first sight appear. The deficiencies are mainly in engines for training purposes, namely, 90 h.p. R,A*P. la engines, 80 h.p. Gnome engines and 80 h.p. Renault engines.     This
2deficiency will, it is hoped, ho made good to a considerable extent by the return of engines from the Front, as irapruvod types are sent out for Service purposes.     The most unsatis-faotory feature is a doficiency of 192 in the requirements of Rolls-Royce engines (190 h.p. and 250 h,p.).     The difficulty as regards these engines, which are required both for certain types of aeroplanes and seaplanes, is the extruinoly limited source of supply, which it has been found iraprao-ticable to enlarge to any considerable extent.A corresponding forecast of deliveries during the four months - July to October - is now in preparation.     When this is ready and has been eensidered, the whole question of policy as regards the extension of facilities for output will be submitted to the Cabinet.xi.   The situation as regards the output of seaplanes is at present unsatisfactory.     No typo of medium seaplane has yet been evolved which in all respects meets with the requirements of the Royal Naval Air Service.     As a result, a great part of the producing energies of manufacturers has been devoted to experimental wozrk, so that actual output is restricted.     The Board, has approved during tho last weok the plaoing of substantial additional ardors, but tho whole constructional programme as regards seaplanes-is under ro-oonsidcration.-\III. The disquieting reports on tho subject of the new R Ej5 Reconnaissanoo Aeroplane which ha-e *f late been a source of considerable anxiety to the Board, will it is npw believed turn out to bo largely unfounded.     The subject was mentioned in tho roport to tho Cabinet of tho 24th February, ThiB is tho machine which was intended to take tho place
of the W0ll-3aio*m B.3S. type, which was found to have in-sufficient speed and po^erc of self-protection for present day requirements.   While the opinions of experienced pilots in regard to the new machine differ, there seems little doubt that its efficiency and safety depend upon the skill of the pilot.   The higher speed at which it travels involves more careful handling than was necessary with the B.E. machine, which was extremely safe and easy to handle.   There arc three Squad-cons of this aachino nty in Uranco and the pilots who have become accustomei to it are enthusiastic in its praise.   Certain modifications have been made in the design *Thich tend to make it rather safer, while the Board are informed that tho course of training of the pilots who are to use it has been specially adapted to its requirements.   Tho fact that a pilot recently refused to fly it an^ win consequently he court-naretiallod, will no doubt draw public attention to tho matter, particularly as the machine is of Government design.Applications XV.   The Board aro awaiting the official notificationby AlliedGovernnents,   of the decision of the Var Cabinet in respect of thecourse to be adopted regarding tho Russian Applications for the supply of aircraft.   keanwhila, however, the Board have found it possible to meet the Russian request for votary training engines by offering as many as 37 of  -certain miscellaneous types r,hich are surplus to our Own requirements.
