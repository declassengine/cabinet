Confidential.267The Urgent Need for a Ministry of Health.1. Public opinion is now keenly aroused on the existing deficiency and inefficiency of our public medical services, especially for maternity and infant welfare. There is a widespread insistent demand for improvement. .The working of the Insurance Act lias shown what can be achieved by a systematic provision of medical services, but these are admittedly inadequate, particularly for the crucially important needs of women and children. Yet directly the Local Government Board proposes a Bill for giving new powers to local authorities to provide improved services for maternity and infant welfare, obstacles are raised; firstly, because it is alleged the uew steps can in fact only he made effective if fitted in closely with the existing insurance services ; this, however, it is almost impossible to achieve under present conditions, since the latter are under a different organisation and direction; and, secondly, because the insurance people say that, unless their services are developed at the same moment, the new Local Government Board step will he prejudicial to Health Insurance work.2. There are several other grave difficulties resulting from the existing chaos in our health services; e.g., in providing medical services for discharged soldiers and their widows and orphans, in the obstacles hampering the development of the needed specialist services for insured persons, large numbers of whom are discharged soldiers; in the constant drag on the improvement of tuberculosis services; and in the quarrelling over maternity and infant welfare schemes. These and other crying evils can only be remedied by the immediate establishment of one Central Ministry of. Health, in place of the two or three separate and competing Government Depart-ments, which at present separately supervise various elements in the national health problem.3. Further, the services of the Local Sanitary Authorities and of the Local Insurance Committees, at present working on different lines and often as rivals, need to be co-ordinated and developed in close co-operation, instead of being (as now) supervised by two separate and rival Central Departments, on differing lines of policy. This, again, can only he achieved by combining into one Central Ministry the medical functions of the Local Government Board and of the Insurance Department.4. This combination could be effected in various ways, some of which would raise large issues that should probably be considered carefully by the Reconstruction Committee, and dealt with legislatively at a later date. But there is a simple and small step which should be taken at once (without prejudice to larger plans of recon-struction) and which would suffice to establish a real Ministry of Health for England and Wales. All that is wanted is a three-clause Bill establishing a &quot; Ministry of Health and of Local Government&quot; to supersede the Local Government Board, and transferring to it the medical and sanatorium functions (but, for the present, no others) of the English and the Welsh Insurance Commissions, and giving to it the necessary powers for bringing into existence the needed new medical services; coupled with provision of adequate Exchequer funds (as was proposed by Mr. Lloyd George in his 1914 Budget) for making suitable grants to the local bodies so as to get the work promptly commenced and efficiently done.5. Under this plan the English and Welsh Insurance Commissions would continue, with all their other functions; the Joint Committee, and its chairman, and the Scotch and Irish Commissions, would not be affected. It would be a first step, involving the minimum of change for the moment, and leaving the larger develop-ments to be worked out carefully by the Reconstruction Committee, to whom that problem should at once be remitted.6. The Bill would he popular and would raise no party controversies. It would be essentially a War emergency measure for making possible the immediate develop-ment of the maternity and infant welfare and other services above described, for which public opinion is already clamouring, and which have become doubly needed by reason of the war-havoc, and doubly urgent if they are to be started before the difficulties of demobilisation render such an initial step both too late and impossible. It is, therefore, earnestly desired that this small but supremely useful step be sanctioned forthwith, so that the Bill may be introduced in the House of Lords at once, with the promise of substantial Exchequer grants.RHONDDA.27 March 1917.a   (33)2455-2   Pk 446   6 6 50   3/17   E &amp; S
