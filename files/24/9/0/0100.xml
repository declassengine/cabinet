G,.T. 396..,WAR, CABINET. HOME-GROW TIMBER, &apos;(Memorandum &quot;by tho President., Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.)In a letter dated March 24th 1917-,  Sir Maurice Rankgy asked, for.the information of the Prime Minister, &quot;what measures &quot;of reafforestation have been undertaken or are in   contempla-tion&quot; -    In replv I submit the following notes.A Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee is investigating Forestry,, and is,  I understand,  almost ready to report.    It Fill prcbably deal specifically with such questions of policy as whether a Forestry Department should be established whether the home-grown timber- trade has been unduly hampered by railway rates,  and whether the work of replanting and affor-estation is to be carried out by the State, by Local Authorities or by private owners,  or, preferably, by all three.   Another important question   with which the Subcommittee will probably deal, is this.   War prices have made a considerable area of privately o^ned woodlands-commercially profitable.    The money paid for this timber is capital.    It might be argued, with some show of reason,  that the Treasury,  in making payment for pur-ohased timber should withhold a portion of the capital for the purpose of oor-pulsorily replantin r the felled areas.    Something is to be said for and against such a proposal.   But it should be noticed that, at present rates of interest, and at pre-war prices, afforestation cannot be made to pay.   On these and other points of policy, presumably investigated-   by the Sub-Committee, no opinion is expressed here.    Only practical questions&apos; are dealt with..A Commission appointed in 1767 to enquire into Crown Woods expressed regret that no attempt had then been made to take stock of the timber contents of woodlands in the country. In the interval of 127 years no effort in this direction was made: it was still, true in 1914.Before the War,  our supplies of home-grown timber were annually decreasing,  and little effort was made to maintain, still less to increase,  the acreage.   Already the United King-dora had a much smaller quantity of woodland in proportion to its population than any country in Europe,  and, by far the smallest area under State control.   At the same time our tirn-ber requirements were rapidly.growing every year,  and prices were steadily rising,   lot only Commercial prudence, but con-siderations of national safety, have now forced the question on the consideration of the Government.    The War has shown the grave danger of this increasing dependence on imported timber.The small area, devoted to woodland also raises a point of some social and economic importance.   A large acreage of land which is not available for arable cultivation is suitable for afforestation.-   At present it is wasted *   Agricultural progress in the future will he largely effected by labour-saving machines.    The extension of arable farming will not, therefore,  necessarily increase our agricultural population. I look to rural industries such as - (l) sugar beet and sugar factories,  (2) potato factories for the manufacture of meal, cc-imercial alcohol, glucose,  and other potato products,  (3) timber,  and the employment of labour for its U3e for manufac-turing purposes-,  for paper making,  and for chemical products, - as the most certain means of increasing the rural population
(l) The area of woo; Paid in the United Kingdom was in 1913 about 3 mi Hi on ac res.England 1,697,400 ac reswale b 186,700Scotland     &quot;       868,400n iiIreland 29Q;800     &quot;3,043,300 acresOf this area 63,000 acres in England and Walesj and 1,000 acres in Scotland are under the Office of r&quot;oods,  and 8,000 acres in Ireland are under the Irish Department of Agriculture.    Other public Departments control a few thousand acres.    With these exceptions,  the existing area of woodland is in private ower-ship,  though a commencement has been made by some cf the large Municipal Bodies to afforest, with State assistance,  the catch-ment areas of their water-supplies.(2)    The uncultivated area of the United Kingdom is approximately 20 million acres.    Of this total acreage;  Deducting that which might be cultivated agriculturally,, and that which owing to el-evation or surface and other conditions is unsuitable,  an area of 5 million a^res might probably be afforested.   Official estiml ates are higher!    The Coast Erosion Committee (Cd .4460)  calcu-late that 7 million acres and 2&quot;million acres of poor tillage -mi gh the avai1ab1e.It is probable that,  at the conclusion of the War,  the greater part of the ripe and. half-ripe softwoods (conifers) in this country, will have disappeared,  ana that large quan-tities of the hardwoods, both mature and immature,  will also have gone.    In respect of conifers,  it will be from 35 to 40 years,  and,  in the case of hardwoods,  from 80 to 100 years&apos;, be-fore the country can be in a substantially better position than it held. in. 1914&apos;.-   The question of increasing the resources.of the Empire by developing and protecting the Canadian forests is one of Imperial importance,especially as any preparations that are made will take three quarters of a century to mature,   mean-while Russian supplies will be our main resource,  and for the mext 30 years or more w-e shall, therefore, practically be dependent on Russia for our softwoods.    In a. memorandum sub-mi t ted by me last October tc the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy after the gar,  the question was discussed cf the advisability of treating the supply of Russian timber as a compensating trade to take the place of. any diminution in our pre-war imports of Russian wheat, - In any commercialunder very favourable conditions as to the occupation and cul-tivation of land.The two aouroes of an increased supply of home-grown -timber are, -I] The replanting.and improved management of felled areas n) The afforestation of vacant areas.

After the War,  the ira-portanoe of a cheap supply of timber for building purposes will be immense.   Railway sleepers will be required in large quanti-ties-.   The need of pit-props is also always present.   But,  on tnis head,  some relief may perhaps be expected from two sources(l) The use of cement instead of wood for props, .(2) The discovery of some means of checking the fui . which&quot;specially attacks pit-props. I brought this point to the attention of the Board of Agriculture mere.than a year ago. If we could prolong the life of a prop by a half, we should propor-tichately diminish the demand. Special investigations are being made in the hope of discovering a remedy.The two main questions for the immediate consideration of the Government are those of replanting and afforestation. Improved management of existing areas in private ewership in commercial principles is also important.   But the task is one cf extreme difficulty,  and,no country has yet succeeded in solving the problem satisfactorily.The first essential is that a continuous policy of replanting and afforesting should be decided upon and steadily pursued for a definite series of years,  - in the case of conifers for from 70 tc 80 years,  in the.case., of hardwoods,  for from 100 to 120 years.   Yi/hen once the series is completed, the normal felling of mature timber in any one year is replaced by the replanting of a corresponding area,  and the continuance of the supply becomes assured.In order to make the country self-supporting,- able, that is,  to provide within its- own borders for its total annual consumption cf timber,  - an area of at&apos; least 15 milliom acres woyld be required.   Bor national safety, however,  less than this acreage is really necesaary, because,  in times of emergency, the normal cutting of timber may be increased in any one year, or in any short period of years, without crippling the productive power of forests.    Therefore.&apos;it would,  in my opinion,  be enough to aim at such an acreage under woods as would enable us to dis-pense with overseas supplies for a period,  say,  cf three years.This limited-object cannot be secured from the existing area of woodlands,   even if the yield of cubic feet per acre could be raised to the same level as that of the State forests of Prussia,, or from less than 20 cubic feet per acre to 55 cubic feet.   Much of the area is not suited to commercial, and scien-tifid forestry.    But assuming that one half of the existing acreage were replanted, and its productivity increased by proper management, an additional area of at least 2 million acres would still require to be afforested.    This estimate includes both softwoods and hardwoods.    If the timber policy is laid down on the lines of 80 years for the former and 1;20 years for the latter,, it would probably be prudent to plant two-thirds of the area in the first half of the period,  or.  say. 1,550,000 acres.    Of this area an approximately equal acreage should be planted each year till the series is completecIt may be assumed that after the War some form of State action will be necessary in dealing with the replantation of ex-isting areas.    where a woodland has been completely felled,  the problem is comparatively simple.    It is more difficult,  either, where the woodland has been only partially felled, but so heavily that the remaining timber is commercially unprofitable,   or where it is so imperfectly managed as to consist of unprofits/ble scrub and worthless timber.    In both these cases,, the proper course, would be, to grub and replant.    This process is more costly than afforestation&apos;; but it is probably advisable, wherever the land is really suitable for the purpose.

Of this area an approximately equal acreage should be -planted each year till the series is complete.It may be assumed that after the War some form of State action will be necessary in dealing.with the replantation of ex-isting areas.    Where a woodland has been completely felled,  the problem is comparatively simple.    It is more difficult,  either, where the woodland has been only partially felled, but so heavily that the remaining timber is commercially, unprofitable,   or where it is so imperfectly managed as to consist of unprofitable scrub and worthless timber.    In both these cases., the proper course, would be, to grub and replant.    This process is more costly than afforestation&apos;-; but it is probably advisable, wherever the&quot; land is really suitable for the purpose.    Replantation is in many areas impossible for some little-- time, because the replanting of the con-iferous- woodlands which have been felled must Ve
undertaken with caution owing to the harbourage afforded to the destructive pine weevil.   Afforestation should,  therefore, he taken in hand at once,  and such preparations as are possible made immediately.   But the practical scope of these preparations is limited to surveying.    Survey parties have been arranged,  con-si sting of officers of the English,  Scottish and Irish liepart-ments..   They will conduct a. survey in the spring,  summer and autumn of the present year to select the areas which seem most suitable for afforestation.    ITo scheme which may be adopted by the Government will,  therefore, I hope, be delayed by the want of a preliminary survey.Beyond this no practical step can be taken immediately. The greatest obstacle arises from the want of seedlings.    It is impossible to set aside and prepare any considerable? area of land for this purpose -at the present time,  owing partly to want of labour, but,  still more,  to the necessity of utilising land for food production.    Any withdrawal of land for timber nurseries creates the impression that the Government is not in earnest in the urgency of its demand for food.So far as the Crown Woods under the Board of Agriculture for England and Wales are concerned,  we have made some arrange-ments for the future,   We have nurseries in which some 25 million seedlings are established,  and we are arranging with nursery-men for sowing a further supply.   We have aiso decided on the general policy necessary for the reconstitution of the Crown &apos; Woods.   Before the War,  the Board pursued the proper policy of getting the best financial results,   how,  in my opinion,  this policy must be so far reversed,  that the Board should aim at raising and maintaining the greatest possible stock of sound timber.    The change will necessarily mean,  so far as profits are concerned,  at least 20 &quot;lean years&quot;.   As a further matter cf general policy it has been also agreed that apuantity,  rather than high quality,  of coniferous timber&apos;5 s what is most required. To attain these objects,  it has been decided that,-(l) Areas which have been felled will be replanted without delay with rapidly growing species;(2) Areas under scrub and poor hardwood will be cleared and replanted as speedily as possible;,,(3) Cuttings in immature coniferous woods will he restricted, as far as possible to those, thinnings which improve growth;(4) It has also been decided that areas well suited to the growth of hardwocd&apos;3 will be devoted to tlia,t purpose up to one-third of the total area of individual forests.   Private owners cannot, as a rule, be expected to grow oaks, because conifers, pay so much better, give a return mere quickly,  and thrive on more indifferent land.. But, nationally,  it would be unwise to &apos; cease growing hardwoods,  and,  I think,  the CroY-n Woods should give the lead in undertaking what is undoubtedly a public duty.(Inilld)    R.E.P. -April 8th, 1917.
