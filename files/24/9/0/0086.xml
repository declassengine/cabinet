CAB/^^e Working frf the Imports Restriction Scheme and *\\    its relation to Shipping entrances.G^$P*st interim Report prepared by the Board of Trade.To the Right Hon. Sir Albert Stanley., E. President of the Board of Trade.Sir,On February 22nd the War Cabinet decided -*&apos;That the President of the Board of Trade should watch the working of the scheme of restricted imports and should report to the War Cabinet from time to time as to the relation between imports and shipping.&quot; In pursuance of the above direction of the War Cabinet I submit herewith the attached first Report from Professor Chapman who has been charged by you with the duty of main-taining a continuous watch over the working of the scheme. The present report deals with the situation up to the latter part of March, so far as the figures are yet available. The outstanding points seem to be:-(1)   The heavy loss of British shipping, especially during March.   Altogether the gross losses during the three months January - March have amounted to 641,000 tons, against which has to be set the building of 337,000 tons,   giving the net reduction of 504,000 tons, or at the rate of 166,000 tons per month.   It will be seen that March was the highest month as regards both the gross loss (358,000 tons), the ships built (170,000 tons) and the net loss (183,000 tons).(2)   The steady and satisfactory maintenance of entries of British ships notwithstanding the losses *    Sir Alfreds    Including 29,500 tons purchased or requisitioned and addedto the Admiralty register.
Watson end liir. Elderton estimated in their Report for a reduction of British entrances&apos; by 851,000 tons (or 18$) during these three months&apos;, whereas the actual reduction was only 267,000 tons   (or 5.6%)(3)   The very ^rave falling off in the entrances of foreign tonnage which, during the three months, declined by 1,075,000 tons (or 46.1%) as compared with the estimate of 548,000 tons (or25.6%) -(4)   The net result on balance is that the estimated falling off in total entrances, British and Forei.ru to-gether, has been almost exactly realised (1,342,000 tons as compared with the forecast of 1,399,000 tons).(5)   The position as regards foreign entries is such as to cause /vrave anxiety.    On the other hand, it is to be remembered that while   the reduction of British entrances is mainly due to the destruction of the ships, which is permanent and irrevocable, the falling off in foreign entrances is partly due to causes which may prove temporary, the disin-clinetion of the owners of the ships to face the risks being possibly overcome or diminished in future by additional attractions or. by purchase.(5)   Statistics of imports for Llarch are not yet available.    The February figures show a reduction in weight of 347,000 tons, of which no less than 341,000 tons consisted of goods whose import is restricted.    These figures so far as they go, are satisfactory as showing that the effect of the restrictions has been to concentrate the reduction of tonnage on the less necessary   classes of imports, the weight of essential imports which are not on the restricted list &apos; -having been  maintained  practically unchanged.    The period however is too short for any definite inferences to be drawn. Y/e must await the March figures.ill
(7)   It is also satisfactory, so far as it roes, to note that the weight of two of the most indispensable classes of imports showed a material increase in February; grain and flour increased by 96,000 tons, and iron ore by 92,000 tons.(6)   we have  figures for the first half of 2Iarch for the S articles - timber, Paper and Paper materials and Raw Fruit - which together account for over three-quarters of the total saving anticipated under the new restrictions. These three items show an aggregate reduction of 169,000 tons, (or at the rate of 338,000 tons per month)    The anticipated monthly saving on these three items when the scheme is in full working order is about 400,000 tons.(9)   The last, part of Professor Chapman!s Report deals in detail with the Timber position, and is so impor-tent that I do not attempt to summarise it here, bevondX ft/pointing out that it looks as though a considerably greater saving: can be effected, certainly in Pit Wood, and probably in Sawn Wood imports, than was anticipated by the Committee.   On the other hand, the saving of, timber would not permit of an equal tonnage of -necessaries being; imported, because the voyages of timber ships are, generally speaking, below the average in length.(10) Notwithstanding the prospect of increased savings under the head of timber, it is clear that the total saving effected  by the adoption of the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee.will be far from equivalent to the total reduction of shipping tonnage.   We may have to contemplate more drastic restrictions before long and in the meantime the situation, will be kept under most c: refill and continous watch.   The lierch figures which will
be ready in a few days, will no doubt throw further light on the position.Of course the whole statistical situation and prospects are likely to be affected profoundly by the entrance of the United States into the War.i am. etc., (Sgd.)   H. IJMELI2N SMITH.April 4th, 1917.
REPORT ON DEPORTS IN RELATION TO SHIPPING-The present report brings the position up to date as far as possible,   some of the information contained in the last report being repeated for convenience.    A full account is also given of the present situation as regards timber, and the last years wr-rk in limiting supplies of paper and paper-making material is reviewed.Throughout March marine losses by war risk have been heavy.    Up to March 25th they amounted to nearly 290,000 tons gross,   as compared with a monthJy average throughout 1916 of about 90,000.    On the other hand, additions are high as they were also in February.    From the 1st to 25th March they almost reached 110,000 tons gross,   bringing the net loss for the period down to 180,000.    In February the net loss was about 140,000*    Detailed figures since the beginning of the     year are given in the table beneath :-

Sir Alfred Watson and Mr, Elderton are now engaged on arevision of their estimates in the light of recent events.   Theresults will be summarised in the next report.   These estimatesare based on a thorough examination of all the data.   It wasoriginally concluded that during 1937 reduction in  MercantileShipping facilities would come to about 4,500,000 net tonnageentrances as recorded in the Board of Trade returns.   This is15 per cent approximately of the tonnage entered in 1916.Entrances as a whole in January and February were -unexpectedlyfavourable, but the results received for iiiarch (up to karch 20th)are nearly half as bad again as Sir Alfred watson and jar. Eldertonthought they would be,   and it looks now as if the losses wouldbe up to the original estimates on the first three months.   Itis true that the Harch entrances of British shipa are still above-the original estimates, but those of Foreign ships are again farbeneath them and even more so than in February.The gain over the estimates on entrances of British vesselsis due in large measure to the action of the transport departmentin directing the course of shipping.      To a considerable extent &apos;cna&apos;cit mean % an economy foreseen by Sir Alfred Watson and ikir. Elderton has been operative earlier than th^y anticipated.   But to some extent it would appear to .nean a greater gain than they allowed for; and, taking everything into account, they are of opinion that what has occurred might justify a substantial reduction ( of more than 500,0Q0 )   in their estimate of losses on British tcnnage entrances for the year;   but it would be imprudent to make any deduction for practical purposes in view of the heavier losses in iiiarch and the very heavy decline in the entrances of foreign vessels.The original estimates and the actual entrances of British and foreign vessels are set forth in the table beneath. i     &apos; (7)

Far the most serious thing- revealed by the returns up to date is the very heavy decline in the entrances of foreign vessels.   In &quot;arch (up to the 20th of the month) it ap^roachea a monthly rate of 350,000 tons over and above what was allowed for; and in the two months of February and Larch this monthly excess rate was more than 250,000.   If this unforseen loss continues, deficiency of. tonnage entraces in 1917 as compared with 1916 is more likely to be 6,500,000 (21.5 per cent) than the estimated 4,500,000 (15 per cent) even when some allowance is made for better results than were anticipated as regards entrances of &quot;ritinh vessels.It remains, however, to see whether recovery is not merely deferred in this case of foreign entries as economies were erocdited in the other case of British entries.   In this connection, it is reassuring; to bear in mind that a heavy fall in foreign entries is not physically unavoidable.   Losse? on the entrances of British vessels are largely necessitated by the physical effects of the submarine campaign;   but those on foroifm entrances result mainly from the incalculable psychological consequences of these physical effects, that is to say from the influence of the latter on the state of mind of foreign ship-owners (though the holding up of some A orican ships merely pending their arming enters into tho account).    Owing to this circumstances as regards foreign ships, there is a large margin for recovery in their entrances.      .a ship at,the bottom of tho sea. is lost for good, but a ship that is voluntarily kept out of the danger zone can conceivably be induced to enter it or be bought.   An unforeseen reduction in the entrances of British ships would have been far more serious.Provis ion has been made for reduced shipping facilities by a policy of prohibiting certain
certain imports.    According to the original Watson-Elderton report red&amp;ced shipping facilities will keep out about 8,000,000 tons of goods in 1917 as compared with 1916, that is 18.5 per cent.    By prohibition of certain imports, this was to be met to the extent of about 6,000,000 a year eventually^ but to an extent of no more than, say, 4,250,000 in the present year as the full saving mil only come into operation gradually.    Thus there is a difference on these figures of about 3,750,000 to make good;   and, if by inducement or purchase neutral vessels cannot be brought through the danger zone in numbers greater than in February and March, this difference will become about 6.500,000.Moreover&apos; it must not be assumed that the estimated losses in mercantile shinning facilities will necessarily be made good this year to the amount of 4,250,000 tons carried.    Far it happens that the bulk of the cargoes that are to be dispensed with under the official restriction of imports come under short journeys, so that the rate of entry of ships when carrying them would be higher than the average rate of entry for the mercantile fleet as a whole, which may be put at 3.4 times a year.     If the former rate were five times a year, a saving of 100,000 of entrances of restricted imports would liberate 20,000 net tons of shipping which would be equivalent to 68,000 tons (20,000 x 3.4) of entrances of other goods taken as a whole.    Against the probable loss on this account must be set some Vain in view of the fact that vessels which enter the danger zone &quot;\ less frequently are less liable to be sunk;   but this counter-acting gain is small compared with the loss.     It would, therefore, be rash to suppose that the loss originally estimated in shipping facilities in 1917 is provided for to an extent that reaches the neighbourhood of one half by the official restriction of imports.The
Tlae- shortness of the voyage taken by many of the restricted imports will be apparent from the following brief analysis.. Of the imports which have&apos;be en restricted the most important from the point of view of tonnage are, &quot;/bod and Timber, Paper and Haw Fruit.   These three groups, it is estimated,, will account for about three-quarters of the saving arranged for on the recommendation of the Imports Restriction Committee.   Now these three groups of commod-ities are largely brought from near countries.   Of the total imports of /ood nearly three-quarters come from European Countries, the greater part from Scandinavia and Prance, and about 2q/o from the States and Canada.      Of paper and paper making materials more than half are obtained from Norway and Sweden,, and about zo/o from Spain, Algeria and the Netherlands.   The same general features are found with regard to the imports of fruit subject to prohibition. About a third come from Spain,. Prance, the Netherlands or the Channel Islands and about 20- from the States of Canada. It is clear, therefore, that on an average the ships bringing these classes of commadities make considerably more than the average number of voyages for the mercantile fleet as a whole.Waiving the point just raised, it may be noted nest that the discrepancies between the estimated losses in tonnage entrances and the reduction allowed for in the -recommendations of the Imports Restriction Committee will be greatest in the first half of the jrear.   This is made apparent by the following table:-.

If allowance had been made for this, the contrasts in the above table would have been even more striking 0
To sum up as regards mercantile imports in 1917, the position is as follom.     A loss of 8,000,000 tons or 18,5 per cent of the imports in 1916, was anticipated in the original Watson - Elderton estimates for 1917,    If foreign ships caimct by inducement or purchase be brought in greater  numbers than at present through the danger tone this loss may become as much as 11,000,000 and on present evidence it would be unwise to assume that it will be less than 10,000,000 or 23 per cent of the imports of 1916.     Against this, the saving arranged for by the recommendations of the Imports Restriction Committee would oome to about 4,250,000 in 1917,    But this having&apos; is partly fictitious as a representation of the extent to which the loss of shipping facilities will be made good, because the cargoes to be prohibited are mainly short voyage cargoes and their prohibition will therefore release less tonnage than is occupied in carrying the same weights for voyages of average distances        When allowance is made for this, there may be a discrepancy of as much as 5,000,000 tons, say, to make good if the original Watson - Sllderton estimates are realised and of 7,000,000 tons, or more if the problem of foreign entrances is not substantially solved.    Moreover, the saving contemplated by the Imports Restriction Committee would not become fully operative before midsummer.On present evidence, it would therefore seem a necessary precaution to go some way in the direction of the larger policy discussed in the supplementary memorandum of the Imports Restriction Committee, and,probably, to meet immediate pressure by temporarily holding up any bulky imports that are not vitally requisite and of v. ieh there are stocks to go on withr    In the larger plans ofthe

The present timber position is discussed at length at the end of this report.   Another possibility of economy is in the import of grain for horses, and en inter-departmental Comrnit-tee has been appointed to consider the possibility of savingon these lines.In tons weight, imports fell by 585,000 in January and 345,000 in February as compared with Watson - Elderton esti-mates of about 590,000 and 900.000 respectively.   The actual figures are not yet available for March, but it is evident from the figures for entrances up to the 20th March, that they will be Jar beneath the estimates for that month. Probably on the three months January to March they will come to about the   2,400,000 tons of the Watson-Elderton estimate.The table beneath shews the extent to which the JemiBry - February reductions fell (a) on imports restricted prior to the new proclamation (b) on imports now in the restricted list which were free before February 23rd and (c) on unres-tricted imports.   In February, before the effect of the new restrictions could be appreciable, the shortage of tonnage was to a large extent holding up the goods to which these restric-tions related,while goods on neither restricted lists were  . scarcely affected.   In jsnmryt however, the latter goods had suffered a heavy decline.
The next table shews the Variations in the chief classes of unrestricted imports.   In January the decline was almost entirely attributable to food.   In February there wasno outstanding figure on the side of reduction.		 -,-. . -.   - -	-Difference in Jan-   I Difference in Feb-uary 1917 on Jan-    j ruary 1917 on Feb-uary, 1916.             j ruary 1916.		1.000  !  per          j   1,000 tons. 1 cent.        !  tons. j         -       &apos;     ......	per c ent.Food Grain and Flour Meat Other Food	Increase /   locr-ease--362 1-36.5        !    / 96 - 6 ; - 6.0        !    7   9 - 12 j - 3.5        I    / 30	A4.8 -10-4 / 1.8	1 -380 ! -26.7         j    /llv    !   i 1,3 If		\                              \                         \	Raw Mat erials.Iron Ore Other Ores Gotton WoolOther Textiles Oil Seeds SkinsMi scellaneous- 26   - 4.8- 9 ! - 4.2 / 2o : /21.8 &apos;f -9 : /28.9 1  4   /m &apos;43-21.0 A5.0Manufactures.Iron and Steel Other Metal Machinery Apparel &apos; Chemicals Carriages etc. OthersUnclassified TOTAL:1- 27- 6&quot;   I 8/22 a- 7-6 -^28*7 -15.6 -48 o 6- 2a8-27	-45.2	93        A	-.77 7/   6	/   -5	f   7	-   -- 27	-39.9	- 37    :	-60.5-  4	-13.. 1			-27.4		--19,0- (6b	-50.7	-^27	.C&quot;!    i-&apos;-   4	-85.1		&quot;60. r.- a. 7	-34.3	- 47    j	-40-5-110 Q	-35.2	!    --26		-49.5		-487 - -16.46
In detail the following points may be noted: Whereas in January 1917 there was a drop of 487,000 tons or 16.4 per cent as compared with January 1916, the imports for February 1917 were approximately equal to those of a year pre-viously, the difference being only 6,000, or .2 per cent. This is accounted for primarily by two. items,    The Imports of Iron Ore in February 1917 were 92,000 tons (22.1 per cent) above the 1916 level and the Imports of Grain-and Flour 96,000 tons (14.9 per cent)   above the corresponding figure of the preceding year, though, taking January and February together&quot; there was a      ... . decline of 266,000 tons (16.2 per cent) compared with 1916 in this latter item.     In February there was also an increase cf 30,000 tons (1,8 per cent) in Food and Drink other than   Grain, Flour and Meat, whilst in January and   February together there was an increase of 8,000 tons (1.2 per cent)   under this head. Taking out grain and flour and iron ore, the decline on all other free goods   was 99,000 tons (6,9 per cent) in January 1916 and 194,000 tons (16.6 per cent) in February compared with the cor-responding months of 1916, that is to say the decline on these goods in February was roughly double that of January (the percentage decrease being more than doubled) in spite of the steadiness of the total figure for February.     The most noticeable difference in industrial commodities between the two months is. in Cotton and Oil Seeds.     In January 1917 the imports of Cotton had increased by 20,000 tons, in February they had fallen by 27,000 tons compared with the corresponding months of 1916, whilst the imnorts of Oil Seeds in January increased by 43,000 tons compared, with January 1916, but they fell in February by d,000 t ons c ompare d with February 1916.    Wool also showed a large percentage/: increase (28.9 per cent) in January and a decline of 16.6 per cent in February.10. As the new restrictions are so recent it is impossible as yet to shew their operation as a whole statistically. But the imports o:QM.j3pmm^ the.largest saying will., be
be made, namely, timber, paper and. paper-making materials and raw fruit, have been obtained for the first fifteen days in March Compared with the same period in 1916 the saving in these has been as follows:-	Decrease in March ltol5 between 1916 &amp; 1917.	per cent. 73Soft Wood other ] than Pitwood     ,	Tons. 66,000	Pit Yioc-d	41.,000	43Paper and &apos; paper making ) materials         ;	42,000	80Fruit	20,000	43The decrease in wood is large in view of the fact that no substantial reduction was originally allowed for until later in the year.    From the one on paper nothing can be inferred as under the Rationing * system adopted the permitted imports come when they can best.    They tend to arrive early in the administrative year. The decrease in fruit is about what was anticipated.As regards licences granted in the first half of March, in the case of timber the existence of general licences prevents^any inference from, being drawn with reference to eventual imports, hut in thfc caso of raw fruit the licenses represent aft- import at the rate of 4,700 toms a month, which would mean a very substantial saving in excess of expectationa0 11.   The following is Sir Thomas Whittakerfs report on restriction with reference to the imports of paper and paper-making material during the twelve months ending on February 28th, and on the policy to be pursued in the new administrative year:-  The Royal
The Royal Commission on Paper commenced the restriction onimportation under the instructions of the Board of Trade on1st March, 1916.   The instructions were that the importation0f paper and paper-making materials was to be reduced by one-thirdiffi^iyear^h^ 1914 was taken as the standard year upon whichthe reduction was to be based.For eight months the restrictions were on that basis, but from 1st November to the end of February the restriction on the importation of paper was increased to 50%, paper-making materials still remaining at the old reduction   of one-third. On January 1st, 1937, however, the importation of paper-making materials was also reduced to 50%, and so continued until theend of February.The combined effect of these reductions was that the total importation of paper and paper-making materials, for the 12 months March 1st 1916   to February 28th,1917, should have beenreduced    by .:37%.The policy adopted by the Commission was to restrict imports as a whole to the limits fixed by the Board of Trade.   The Commission did not attempt to restrict each individual item of the imports to the proportion fixed, but was content -if the total came within the fixed limits.    This policy was adopted first, because the object of the restriction was to save ship-ping tonnage, and so long as -it was saved it did not appear to the Commission to be material on what particular items the saving was made;   second, because under the altered conditions of Trade under the War, it was desirable to leave as much latitude as possible to the various branches of the trade, so that they might adjust themselves to the. new conditions with as little inconvenience as possible so long as the total result aimed at was secured.The following table shows the result of theCommission&apos;s,&apos;lO&apos; x lo ;

Z6iFrom; this table it will be seen that the actual total.reduction in the imports of paper and paper-making materialseffected by the Commission was 651,625 tons, or 36i per cent.Included in these imports there were 20,752 tons of pamper andpaper-making (19) ^ *s
paper-making materials for which extra licences were granted to meet the special requirements of G-overnment Departments (The stationery Office, The Ministry of -innitions and The War Office).    If these special grants for Government requirements be deducted from the total imoorts, itj^will he seen that the total reduction in&apos; ordinary imports effected by.the Commission was 672,377 tons.    That represents a reduction, as compared with the year 1914, of  37.3 per cent, or practically precise-ly the reduction required by the instructions given to the Commission by the Board of Trade.For the second year commencing March 1st, 1917, the reduction the Commission is making, in order to carry out the instruction^ of the Board of Trade, is that it is giving licences for the importation of paper-making materials, and ordinary writing and printing paper, to the extent of one-half of the importation in the previous year but it is restricting the importation of packing and wrapping paper, strawboard, mill-board, etc to one-fourth of the importation of the previous year.      It is anticipated that this reduction will enable the Commission to keep the total imports, including the larger supplies which it is understood the Government will require,, within the limits of 640,000 tons authorised by the Board of Trade.Up to the present time the imports for Llarch under the new arrangement have been small and considerably within the pro-portion which otherwise would have come in.    That is, of course due to the difficulties under which shipping is working owing to the submarine menace.12.    The following shows the present position as regards timber:-Out of a total monthly saving of 500,000 tons, for which the Restriction of Imports Committee furnished estimates, 272,000 tons,
or over half, were to come from a reduction in the imports of timber.    But the Committee realised that some time must elapse before the timber restrictions could be made fully effective, and for 1917 they estimated a saving of 2,3705000 tons, or about 200,000 tons on the average per month.    The reduction proposed was far less in respect of pitwood than other kinds rf soft timber, as the following table shews:-Imports during 1915		Estimated Re-duct ios of Im-ports in 1917	Percentage Reduction	Tons	Tons	Per centPitwood Other Soft) Timber   )	2,000,000 4,200,000	300,000 2,070,000	15 50 -* .... *..........- - --sAs regards   the relatively smaller reduction thus proposed in the case of pitwood, it is important to bear in mind.the follow ing considerations:(a)    There had already been a very great reduction in the im-ports of pitwood,resulting partly in a reduced consumption, and partly in a reduction of stocks.    The matter was put thus by the Restriction of Imports Committee:-&quot;The consumption of pit timber before the war was about 4,500,000 tons per annum, of which it is estimated that one-fifth was supplied from the United Kingdom.    It has now fallen, partly in consequence of the reduced output of coal, to 3,500,000 tons in 1916, of which over 2,000,000 tons were imported, mainly from France and Scandinavia&quot;    The consumption of pitwood in 1916 was thus about 22 per cent below the normal (the reduction in the output of coal being about 10 per cent).    This great diminution was due to the difficulties which prevailed from an early stage in the war in obtaining shipments from Scandinavia and Russia, and the congestion at the French ports-,   these factors forced up prices from 300 to 500 per cent above the pre-war level, and it may be assumed that anything that was possible in theway
way of economies in consumption had been accomplished before-the end ef 1916.   On the other hand the field for economy in the use of other kinds of timber by restricting its use f6r non-essential purposes, b&apos;7 securing the salvage and return of packing cases sent to France Joe was still largely unex-plored.   Moreover, whereas the stocks of pitwood at the end of 1916 were below their normal level, varying from 31 weeks supply in England and^S weeks in Scotland to only 6&apos;^ .-&apos; weeks in South Wales, the stocks of other soft timber were iE3imlilrly large and amounted to about 8 months supply..(b) as against this an increase of hone production is a far easier thing in the case of pitwood than of sawn timberThe director of timber supplies states that there is an abundance of standing pitwood; its felling requires no special skill, and it is estimated that 12,000 men could supply the 3,000,000 tons that are required.   This represents nearly IV0 tons per annum per man.   Sawn timber requires 3, far higher degree of skill, and the processes of manufacture are more numerous;   the figures supplied bv the Timber Controller  for the output of sawn timber by trained Canadian -lumbermen give an annual output of only 60 tons per man.   Moreover the problem of home supply of pitwood has for a long time back received special attention.   Nearly a year ago steios were taken to organise home production on systematic lines by the appbint-ment of a Joint Pitwood Committee and of local Pitwood Committees, representing the Government, the Colliery owners-, the owners of woods, and other interests concerned.   There ii-t thus in the ca ;e of pitwood an organisation, with the reoui-site local machinery and central control, which has the experience of several month1s work behind it.o)
(c)   The pitwood imported into South Wales   conies mainly from France, while the other districts araw the bulk of their foreign supplies from Scandinavia.      The length of voyage of ships carrying pitwood is thus far below the average,   and .-the number of entrances they make in the course of a year is correspondingly high.    Moreover, imports from France represent often cargoes of ships which would otherwise return in ballast,   or incompletely laden.     Imports from Scandinavia are in a different position,   as   they are beset with diplomatic end other difficulties,   which may make their reduction specially desirable.    But in any case the shipping which can be set free by a given tonnage diminution of imports of pitwood Mb far smaller than what would be released - by an equivalent reduction-, of imports all roupd.       The average length of voyage is,--considerably greater in the case of sawn T-&quot;ood,   which comes1 largely from Canada, though this too is foa? below the fverage. Moreover,   any reduction which is brought about in the demands of the Commander-in-Chief for supplies from this country, either by economies in use, or by timber operations in  France, diminishes in addition the tonnage required to-transport goods from England to -France,   and this relieves the tonnage pressure at a specially crifcial point.The
-   40213,   The net effect of these considerations is that theproblem of pitwood is at once far easier and less importantthan that of sawn timber.   Prom the statement of theDirector of Timber  applies quoted above it appears thatonly 12,000 men of whoa few need be skilled would be requiredto produce the whole of the two million tons imported lastyear.   The immediate difficulty is the special   case ofSouth Wales, which is acoustomed to pitwood of a differentkind to that used by other districts.   The stocks which were6iL weeks&quot; supply at the end of last year had fallen by the 3middle of March to only 2-1 weeks   of normal consumption.   It has therefore been necessary to permit iaportatio;: from Prance on a larger scale than was at first proposed, and it is argued that for the present this importation must be main-tained at the rate of 20,000 tons a week.   Meanwhile arrange-mentv have been pressed forward for obtaining the pitwood from local sources and for releasing 3,000 miners from the collier-ies in South Wales for this purpose.  Up to the middle of March the imports of pitwooc into the United Kingdom during 1917 were 245,000 tons, against roughly; 390-000 tons in the corresoonding period of 1916;   At this rate of importation, there would be a reduction of about 725,000 tons in the year, or about 2i times the programme of the Restriction of Imports Committee *   Bat it seems not unreasonable to expect that the reduction will amount to as much as 1-J: million tonsc   It must however, &quot;be borne in mind that it is unlikely that this reduction would release shipping capable of bringing in more than 500,000 tons of other imports, though, for other reasons, it may be none the less important that this reduction should be made.   The Director of Timber Supplies anticipates little difficulty in obtaining the requisite labour for the purpose. He welcomes the system, under which the work is entrusted to coalminers, in the pay of the colliery companies, a system which has certain obvious merits.,   It should be consideredwhether
whether the number of men taken for this purpose should not be allowed for when future contributions of men to the army-are being settled.14.   The Restrictions of Imports Committee thus analysed the saving of 2,070,000 tons, which they hoped would be se-cured in the imports of other kinds of sawn timberTonsExcess of 1916 imports and home productionover requirements for 1917 &quot; 550.000Economies in use military and civil 220,000Supplies drawn from stocks in United Kingdom(one-quarter of stock) - 750,000Increase in supplies from French forests formilitary purposes.- 300,000Increase of production in United Kingdom formilitary purposes &quot; 250.000Total:- 2,070,000Thus only 550,000 tons, or not much more than a Quarter, were to be saved as the result of increased production at home or in France.it first sight it would appear very doubtful whetherthe saving in respect of the first two items of this listamounting to 770,000 tons would be realised, in vie/ of theconstant tendency of the demands of the Army to increase.Moreover, in detailing this analysis the Comrittee had torecord in a foot-note that increased demands had iust beenreceived for the .:..rmy in France which if continued throughoutthe year would involve an addition of 600,000 tons.   But, &quot;this part of the uro.gramme is likelv to be secured bv reasonwhich the Shipping of the fact that the shipping/Controller has available forthe transport of timber from England to France is insufficientto carry nearly the Whole of the Army demands.The following table shows a-comparison between thedemands of the Commander in Chief for the first seven;
seven months of 1917 anc the amounts which it has been possible to supply,up to   the present and which it is esti-mated will be supplied in the future1917Demand of I   Commander in-Chief.j Supnly (actual up i to*February and ! estimated for latermonths).January February83,000 132, Ovju 110,000 142,000 122,00076,000i66,OOuMarch66,000April51,000ilayJuly,June133,000125,00078,000 50,000 83, UX)TOTAL470,000Thus it is estimated that only about 60 per cent of the demands of the Commander-in-Chief will in fact be supplied :rom ar land on account of the shortage of available shipping&quot;. These demands are exclusive of timber produced in France and it is not unlikely that the difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies from lingland will provide an extra incentive to timber oper-ations in France which should be capable of realising more than the 300,000 tons estimated under this head.It is urgently desirable that France should be made as far as possible self-supporting in respect of timber; and it is satisfactory to note that great progress has recently been made in pressing forward arrangements for a greatly increased output in France.Given tho necessary labour, saw mills, machinery and tractors, Lord Lovat is confident that France can be made self supporting (including most of its sleepers but not including its tongued and grooved boaiding).   It is therefore
therefore of tha utmost importance that these requirements should he given every possible facility.There are no data for considering what detriment the reduced supplies to the Army in France may have on military operations, nor-what-consequent Increase they may cause in later demands.    But they should certainly have the effect of stimulating not only output in France, but economies in use, and it is not unlikely that a considerable scope for military economy will be found possible,15, As regards civil- economies, sales of amounts exceed-ing one standard to private individuals for civil purposes have been prohibited unless the buyer certifies that the timber is required for work of national importance.    Inspectors have been, appointed to see that this rule is properly observed but the Director of Timber Supplies fears that this condition will not be universally effective and is considering the question of imposing a more definite and stringent limitation, as for instance, that   no merchant may sell for civil purposes more than one per cent of his stock per month and that the use of wood for certain purposes should be formally prohibited.The Director of Timber Supplies further anticipates a saving, as the result of economies by public departments, by a diminished construction of hutments etc. considerably in excess of the estimate of tho Restriction of Imports Committee.16r As regards the production in the United Kingdom of sawn timber, Sir Bampfyldo Fuller aims at the production of 2,000.000 tons during the next 12 months.   To accomplish this he will need the services of at least 40,000fmostly untrained) men.   As matters stand he expects to receive only about 9,000 of these 40,000 from&quot; Canada and Newfoundland and though he is sounding the capacities of Ireland and the possibilities of the National Service scheme have yet to be revealed, he considers that it is only from the Army that the bulk of the men can be obtained..    Accordingly, he recommends the adoption of the
the following proposals:-(l) that the calling up of men engaged in felling, sawing or hauling timber be absolutely prohibited, except in the case of Glass A men, who are under 25. (2) that all men of experience in felling, sawing or hauling of timber be freed from the Home Army unless they are of Class A and are under 25-(3) that men of lumber experience in the Australian,andNew Zealand forces now in hngland, be detached for service a3 foremen*(4) that within the next half year, arrangements be made toallocate for timber work 25,000 men who are now in the Home j Army.Since much of the labour must be.skilled, and since-     vtransport and machinery present also pressing problems, it appears exceedingly doubtful whether these extra 2,000,000 tons will actually be produced in the United Kingdom in the next twelve months, though everything points to the importance of taking immediate steps to reach this large figure tif possible. In view of all the circumstances, it will certainly need great.... -effort and determination to increase the output in the United Kingdom of   sawn timber by, say,half that amount in 1917, and to obtain this increase phenomenal success will be needed in coping with the various labour, transport and machinery difficulties.    To doal specially with these problems. Colonel iiacdonald has recently been appointed assistant j,Director of Timber Supplies.In aiming at an increased production of 2.000.000 tons. Sir Bampfylde Fuller is endeavouring to save the necessityftof any Imports of sawn timber, beyond a few hundred thousand tons.     It may be assumed that   the home &quot;product ion will at all events steadily increase, and it is, therefore., safe to draw upon stocks to a considerable extent;   and it may be possible.as(28) : I
as is assumed to make up the &quot;balanceby economies in comsumption, and increased output in France.The following table shows for recent months the pro- &apos; duction of the saw mills of the Home Grown Timber Committee (now absorbed in tho Directorate of Timber Supplies) and of the contractors making deliveries to them:-rlonth.!

It will be noted that the output has increased from month to month appreciably though  not remarkably.   The increasef in February, however, must be taken to represent in the main an abnormal expediting of Contractors * dcliver-ies obtained largely at the e:-ipense of March.   If the rate of production during 1917 averaged .nly 35,000 tone per month, 420,000 tons would be socured in a year (an advance oi about 250,000 tons on 1916) and the whole cf the fore-cast of the Restriction of Imports Com:: it tee would be rcal-ised.The output of the Home Grown Timber Committee repre-cents, of course, only a part cf the total production of sawn timber in the United Kingdom.   No returns are avail-able as to production by private saw^illing firms; in order to watch the timber situation completely it would be necessary to obtain periodical returns of their output. Theemployment
employment figures of such firms show that their labour now stands at about three-fourths of that employed before the war, and has still a slight tendency to decrease though a considerable amount of overtime has lately been worked,- *-k special department of the Hinistrv cf Munitions has recently been set up to secure an increase in the produc-tion of native iron ore.   The import  of iron ore during 1S16 were 6,000,000 tons.It is impossible to say as yet how much, if any saving will be effected in importation as a result of this increased home production particularly in view of the fact t?-at the demands, for iron ore are constantly increasing, and that the new ores vail presumably be of a low quality. But it is obviously a most important matter that this pro-duction should be facilitated as far as possible.(30)
