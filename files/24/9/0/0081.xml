The. Food Production Department has relieved the Branch of much of the correspondence relating to applications for employment.The removal of Publications Branch from 8, r/hitehall Place to o, St. James1s- Square is approaching completion.     This removal has occupied some weeks, mainly owing to the heavy work of moving the Library.     It is a matter of some doubt how long the Board will be able to retain occupation of 3, St. James1s Square, the lease of which expires this year, but in any case a further removal of the Publications Branch (and other branches) will be necessary at no distant date.     This recurring expense and inconvenience will only cease when the Board is permanently housed in a suitable building.The final decision of the Office of &quot;Torks as to the proposals for improving office accommodation at &quot;&apos;ihitehall Place is still being awaited.The printing and stationery business continues to be much the same as previously reported.
