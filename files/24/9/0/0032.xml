The Committee considered the suggestion that Schleswig Holstein deserters from the German Army, of whom there were about 7,000 in Denmark might be conveyed to and employed in the United Kingdom.    It was understood that the Danish Author-ities favoured the proposal.The Committee decided that.Mr,Hope, H.F. Chairman of the Prisoners of War Employment Committee should take up the question in consultation with the Home Department and Foreign .  Office.x x x x xII.Telegram from Sir R.Paget dated Copenhagen  7th March 1917.Military Attache? ha3 frequently enquired when deserters ready but.none yet forthcoming.     Informed difficulty is Society short of funds and afraid to raise subscription.   Have &apos;  been asked if His Majesty&apos;s Government will grant free passage under Society* s guarantee of repayment after peace.     Suspect real difficulty is fear of submarines and dislike of intern-ment.
Admiralty Remarks on Paragraph 5 of the Minutes of a Meeting jTfjho Prisoners of War Sub-Committee held on March 16th 1917.The question discussed in Para 5 :f the above Minutes of conveying 7000 Schleswig-Holstein deserters from Denmark to Sis couiitry presents many difficulties.   It would be impossible to keep the matter from the knowledge of the enemy who would Jrooably make a special effort to sink any ship with these men on &quot;ooard.If a port on the East Goast of Jutland were selected for embarkation the.transports would have to leave territorial waters in certain places on the way to the North Sea owing to navi-gational requirements.     The protection of the vessels would be difficult to arrange owing to their proximity bo enemy bases and to the presence of submarines which would preclude the use by us of large ships to support the escorting destroyers.If the men were embarked tit Copenhagen it would be possible for the ships to keep in Swedish and Norwegian territorial mters round the Skaggerak to a position whence they could cross at night under escort of British destroyers, but it appears open to doubt whether under the circumstances the enemy would respect territorial waters if there was an opportunity of tor-pedoing the ship.An alternative might be to send the men ever land to Bergen and embark them there.     This would involve obtaining the agreement of Sweden and Norway to the men passing through their territory.     International Law does not deal with the question of the passage of deserters through a neutral country.   Per-ffiission might be given if the men were looked upon as fugitives but it appears probable that either Sweden or Norway might refuse permission on the&apos; grounds that the granting of such persr aission would be an act unfriendly to Germany, the men being on the way to England.The provision of the necessary number of British ships (tonnage estimated at 15,000 to 30,000 tons) would be most hfficult, if not impossible, to arrange owing to the shortage of available ships, and the passage of the vessels across the North Sea would be hazardous, even with an escort, as the enemy *ould have ample warning.Another point which would require consideration is whether toe men themselves would agree to taking risks entailed in proceeding to England and whether they would work when over here, ^ey would have to be considered as prisoners of war, as there &apos;&quot;&apos;ould be no guarantee of their bonafides and it would be hurting trouble to relax.any measures taken in guarding them &apos;f prisoners of war.   They would require to be interned separate-sf from captured prisoners of war, to prevent trouble.The difficulties entailed in the transfer of these men Jpear to outweigh any possible advantages unless the Danes J--dertake the whole of the arrangements, using their own ships.^Liiralty28th March 1917.
Minute by Mr.James 7.Hone, M.P.IV.3.Sir Maurice Hankey.Referring to your Office file of papers 35/s/l herewith returned, I submit that neither Sir R.Paget&apos;6 telegram of the 23th nor the Admiralty memorandum of the 29th should be considered as disposing of this question.   For one thing it is not a matter of bringing over the whole 7000 at once, if at all:   I imagine the Home Office would &quot;be considerably embarrassed if they had to deal with anything like that number suddenly.   I agree that the Admiralty cannot be. expected, as things are, to provide transport; out I suggest that Sir R.Paget (or our Secret Service) should be empowered to offer inducements to come over, in batches and by different routes, to as many men as the Danish Society mentioned will vouch for.   It seems largely a question of money, i.e. they should have a bonus for the risk of the journey and a guarantee of adequate wage-3 for a sufficient period.     Also it should be made clear that the &quot;internment&quot; is nominal so long as they behave themselves:   I under^k&amp;nd that the Home Office will only pa?/ them through a camp and have them out in a few days to work u under War Agricultural Committees or otherwise in the same way as friendly Austrian Slavs are now released.   I believe that the M.T.Branch of the War Office think it important to get these men ay/ay from Denmark lest the Germans should demand their extra-dition - and for the same reason the Danish Government are anxious to be rid of them.The matter has, of course, come before me as Chairman of the Prisoners of War Employment Committee, inasmuch as we have had demands for five times as much labour as we can satisfy(Sgd)    JAMES P.HOPE-.UJlU.il  .IS2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 51st March 1917,
