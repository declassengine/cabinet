During the week 81 enquiries by Inspectors have been made in connection with the encouragement of the keeping of pigs, poultry and rabbits and the collection of waste food.

There appears to be an increasing tendency on the part of local Authorities to go in for pig keeping: and as the Local Government Board are offering no objection to the Authorities incurring reasonable expense in this direction further extension seems probable, though the high price of feeding stuffs operates as a deterrent.
