3 E C R E T,T,. 397- WAR CAE I Mi T.PROPOSED REGULATIONS WITH. REGARD - TO THE  ISCIPL&amp;5IARY RELATIONS OF&quot; THE MERCANTILE MAR I KB TO THE NAVY.* * * * .* * *. * * * ... * * * * *.Admiralty,7th April 1917.My dear Hankey,In order to enable you to see that the question is not being overlooked, I send you a.copy of a letter which has-been sent to the Board of Trade to-day in regard to the.&apos;disciplinary relations of the Mercantile Marine to the Navy.(Sd) .  W. Graham Greene[Copy of letter No. N.L.l/63770/l7 dated fth April 3.917 from Admiralty, to the Board of Trade).Sir,I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Board of Trade, that they have had under their consideration the most convenient means of obtaining powers to enforce - , compliance on the part of Officers and men of the Mercan-tile Marine with orders given to them by Naval Officers, a question which was raised at the Meeting of.the War Cabinet held on January 3-d 1917*2,     These orders mainly consist of directions as to tho route to be taken to avoid, submarines and measures to be taken when in dangerous areas.      In territorial waters at home such matters are provided for to a very great extent by the Defence of the Realm Regulations Nos, 36, 37, 36, and 39* &quot;but&apos; considerable difficulty has been experienced in some cases in conducting prosecutions under these Regulations before a Civil Court.3.     In view of the doubt as to the applicability of those regulations as, regards offences- committed- by the Master or a member of the crew of a British merchant.ship when in foreign parts, it appears to Their Lordships that it would be dhsirable to provide that all such offences, whether at home or abroad should be dealt with promptly by means of a Court composed of Officers with Sea&quot;experience.     Such a Court can sift- ti e evidence and give due consideration to any technical pleas that may be advanced by.the. accused.
3.     She Naval Discipline Act now provides (Section 57.A.) for Disciplinary Courts being assembled in War Time to try offences of a somewhat similar nature on the part of Naval Officers.    .&apos;This Court is not invested with th&amp; full powers of a Court Martial and cannot impose any such punishment as Detention 01* Imprisonment.    It.has the further, advantage that it may include amongst its members Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve.4.     My Lords therefore propose that the Naval Discipline Act should be amended with a view to obtain powers for dealing with these offences by means of Disciplinary Courts.     The Naval Discipline Act already contains a provision (Section 31) requiring Masters of fS.ipa tp obey any orders they may receive from the Naval Officer in charge of the Convoy, and the proposed amendment might be inserted either in place of this section or else next to itas Section 31a,     A draft to give effect.to   Their Lordships&apos; views has been prepared by the Parliamentary Drafts-, man, and a copy is enclosed for the information of the Board of Trade.     It will be observed that it is proposed that the Disciplinary Courts should have power to deal with.the Certificates of Officers a^ they may consider necessary.5&quot;.   &apos; It is thought that legislation in this direction will afford a safeguard to Owners against Officers disregarding instructions given to them to secure the safety of the ship and the lives entrusted to their -care, and that at the same time the offending Officers will have the advantage of presenting their explanations to a Court which is in a position to appreciate them at their full value..6.     In these circumstances My Lords hope the Board of Trade will be able to signify their concurrence in the proposed legislation at an. early date.^        I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd)   W, Graham Greene.The Secretary,Board of Trade.&apos;&apos;ya*?lli$i!!^ &quot;    twos-.:...y.&apos;..;,:.     . ..---&quot;T:&apos;::
