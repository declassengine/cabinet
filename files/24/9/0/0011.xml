COPY.SEC RE T . G.T. 311.WAR CABINETp,      Operations.From General Hanbury Williams to C.I.G.S.26.3.17.913.   Following is complete translation of memorandum referred  to in my 914.&quot;Presenting my respects to the representative of British Mili-tary Mission at Russia G.H.Q,.,  I regard it as my conscientious duty,, in order to avoid the serious consequences.which might arise from the omission to express frankly my opinion of the possibility of fulfilling decisions arrived at in the course of the Petrograd Conference:- First: Letter just received from the Minister of War points out that the interior political commotions have had a serious effect on the condition of our reserve (depot) units throughout the entire country.   They are in a state of moral confusion and cannot be employed as reinforcements for three or four months,  that is, earlier June-July. Second: The same causes and effects bear equal relation to the cavalry of the whole army.Abowe situation necessitates looking facts straight in the eyes,  and stating with complete frankness that we cannot assume the offensive here at the commencement of May,  old style,  and can count upon participation on a large scale only in June-July.   Position allows to the enemy the possibility of concentrating all his reserves on the French front,  or with greatly increased ( ? group omitted), to fall upon us, profiting by our temporary period of weakness. Circumstances should, I think,  entail certain alterations in consid-eration of operations in the near future and influence decisions arrived at at the Petrograd conference.In particular must be considered General Nivelle&apos;s communication dated March 16th,  that he will employ the whole strength of the French Armies for an.offensive on the west front,  in order to obtain a definite result.
Obligatory and unavoidable (for their preservation for the future), inactivity of the Russian Armies in the next few months in my opinion calls for French Army not to be exhausted, and for &apos;j.ts reserves to be kept until compatible with the time when, with joint forces we shall be in a position to attack enemy on all fronts.Sixth.    I think also that it would be more expedient, under the circumstances of our enforced inaction, that the British-French Armies at least should follow up enemy&apos;s retreat slowly and prudent -ly, and should also occupy new and strong lines of defence. This does not refer to decisive attack by British-French Armies on enemy in retreat on strongly fortified lines, perhaps intending some large manoeuvre in open warfare, where freedom of movement of reserves&apos; might give a favourable opportunity to one side or the other.But in such an operation enemy, who is based on prepared, strongly fortified positions, would possess an undoubted advantage.&quot;
