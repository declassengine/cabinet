WAR CABINET

P.S. to IRISH MEMORANDUM NO. 2

Since this was written a suggestion has been made in more than one quarter that a new Speaker&apos;s Conference should follow up its success over the franchise by considering the question of the Second Chamber and of the creation of subordinate units of government in the United Kingdom. Of that could be arranged, then the question of the powers to be conceded to Ireland as one of these subordinate units would naturally fall to this Conference, leaving the field a clear for Irishmen to settle among themselves in a separate conference the question of the form which the future Irish Government or Governments should take.
