IMPERIAL WAR CONFERENCE.Note on Emigration from India to the Self-GoverningDominions.I. This question was discussed at the Imperial Conference of 1911, when the Secretary of State for India (the Marquess of Crewe) put in a memorandum, &apos; subsequently published (Cel. 5476-1 of 1911).   The only legislation of importance since then was the South Africa Immigration Act of 1913.2. While none of the Dominions has mentioned natives of India as &quot; ,     . ,   . .   ,      .      prohibited   immigrants,   the   several1 Winch   lias    differentiated   affamst    i\     -   - / ,.     vr     r       n     -,u-        , 0        Dominions    (except    Newfoundland )Ohinese only. - - \,      1 - i     , -ihave effectually1 guarded themselves against an influx of Asiatics. Australia and New Zealand impose an educational test upon immigrants, while Canada and South Africa have taken power to exclude immigrants belonging to any race deemed unsuitable as residents. South Africa has issued instructions to immigration officers that Asiatics are &quot;unsuitable&quot;; Canada has not. In practice Canada excludes Indians by insisting that&apos; all immigrants shall have come by through ticket on continuous journey from their country of origin, a provision hitherto effective because there has been no.direct steamer service. In addition, Canada insists that each Asiatic immigrant must possess 401. ($-200), ^unless he belongs to a country as to which special statutory regula-tions are in force, or with which, there is a special agreement). From an Imperial point of view, the flaw in the Canadian system is that it puts Japanese in a far better position than British dndian subjects. Japan has secured this by agreeing to limit emigration of the labouring class to Canada to 400 a year.3. South Africa has, by an administrative order, absolutely shut the door to fresh immigration from India, with the important exceptions that one lawful wife (with her minor children) of any domiciled Indian who lias not already a wife in South Africa has the right of entry, and that the Union Govern-ment lias promised to admit by special permit as many as twelve educated Indians each year.4. In Australia and New Zealand, Indians who do not know the English language are unable to fulfil the educational requirements of the laws. In Australia, however, an Indian who knows English perfectly can be excluded for want of knowledge of some other European language. (This provision is applicable to immigrants of any race except the British.)5. Thus all the Dominions are secured against an influx of uneducated Asiatics.6. In each Dominion the Government has power to admit individual immigrants (who would otherwise be excluded) by permit. In Canada, apart from special permits, tourists, students, teachers and certain other educated persons, do not come within the scope of the Immigration Laws.&quot; In the other Dominions they do, and their admission depends on the decision of the Minister in each individual case.7. Each Dominion allows the return of Indians who have acquired domicile, subject to the necessary precautions to prevent personation or forgery.8. South Africa (with a large permanent Indian population) differs from the other Dominions in allowing (subject to strict precautions) any Indian who .22101   I       50-3/17
has acquired the right of residence to bring his wile and his young children from India to take up permanent residence. In Australia and New Zealand the absence of any such provision does not appear to have caused resentment on the part of Indians, but much political capital has been made out of the matter as regards Canada. Here there are hardly any Indian women (the men having entered, unaccompanied by women, before the promulgation of the Orders&quot; in Council which in effect prevent any fresh Indian immigration). The Dominion Government does not insist upon the possession of $200 by the wives of domiciled Indians, but the &quot; continuous journey &quot; provision in practice makes it impossible for the women to come. Much has been made in India of this grievance, though it is very improbable that in practice more than a dozen or so Sikhs of the labouring classes would wish to bring over their wives, especially since the Indian community in British Columbia has become so much smaller. The efforts made to do so were probably inspired by political agitators who wished to, and did, produce cases which aroused sympathy. But the average Sikh, ready to travel all over the world to make money, does not in the least wish to be hampered by a helpless wife. Resident Japanese may introduce not only their families but domestic-servants, so that the differentiation against British Indians is very marked.1). As&apos; regards the temporary visits of Indians of goodposition, the various Dominion laws allow persons with good credentials to enter (in Canada, as &apos;.&apos;tourists,&quot; and elsewhere, by special permits). Although, educated Indians chafe at the necessity of suing for permission to enter the Dominions, while all British subjects can enter India freely, it is very difficult to make any positive suggestion. Sympathetic action on the part of immigration officers might go far to mollify the sense of grievance undoubtedly felt by educated Indians. The grievance might be more effectually remedied if each Dominion Government were to empower an agent or agents of its own, resident in India, to issue permits to visit the Dominion, to Indians with good credentials, for specified purposes. &quot;Whether such an arrangement would be practicable is a matte]- for consideration.10. The Indians settled in the Dominions make complaints from time to time on various points, such as the absence of political equality with full citizens. Such matters arc entirely within the discretion of the several Governments, and need not be discussed. But it is of importance to note that the biassed administration of municipal regulations as to the grant of trading licences may in practice inflict&apos;more injury on individual resident Indians than do some statutes against which Indians have protested.11. It is quite recognised that some Indians resident in the Dominions have put forward claims in the direction of requests for the Parliamentary franchise and for the recognition of non Christian marriage systems which no Dominion Government could grant without danger to the character of its own institutions, and have thus weakened their requests for remedy of more material grievances. The argument for allowing resident Indians who possess the necessary educational and property qualifications a vote in municipal elections-where this does not already exist is based not only on the fact that they arc taxed for municipal purposes, but on the obvious consideration that their safeguards for equitable treatment from municipal officials in. such matters as the issue of licences would be enhanced by their possession of votes.12. As regards the Parliamentary franchise, it has been argued in Natal in the past that Indians, as coming from a country that did not enjoy repre-sentative institutions, were not fitted for. a Parliamentary vote. But the extension of the representative character of Legislative Councils in India has certainly modified the force of this argument, at least in its application to Indian merchants. The franchise, as regards the status of non-European races, differs considerably in the several provinces of the Union of South Africa, and in this, the only one of the-self-governing Dominions in which an Indian vote would have much political influence, the question of the admission of Indians to the Parliamentary franchise could not be entirely dissociated from very difficult questions of the political status of African
natives. It does not appear to have been noticed that while anyone from the Dominions is free to enter and do business in British India, and is eligible for appointment to the Indian Services, no non-official Canadian or Australian, for instance, who takes up&apos;his residence in India acquires any-voice in the government of the country, except in so far as he may happen, on account of his business, to become one of the electors for the representation of the special interests (such as Chambers of Commerce, or Tea Planters in Assam) in the Legislative Councils.I ?,. It is common ground that Indians of any class who have been allowed to acquire residential rights in the Dominions should be accorded equitable treatment. It is not yet admitted, except Ivy South Africa, that Indian men who have acquired residential rights should be allowed to introduce women of their own race. The objection, no doubt, is that Canada, Australia, and ^yew Zealand consider it undesirable to have a permanent-Asiatic domiciled community such as exists in South Africa, though Canada, in fact, has allowed the foundation of a permanent Japanese colony. On the other hand, the constant charges of sexual immorality made against Indians, and the fears expressed as to undesirable miscegenation, show the unnatural position produced where Indians who have been allowed to acquire a domicile are not allowed to lead a normal family life.14. The embargo against unlimited immigration of Indians of the labouring classes is understood in India, though not popular. But the provisions which, while not preventing the visits of educated Indians, put upon-them the onus of proving to Dominion officials that they do not belong to prohibited classes, are undoubtedly a cause of much friction, and have helped to create in Indian political circles a very strong feeling of hostility to the Dominions. While the Government of India have always felt great difficulty about any arrangement under which they would be called upon to decide as between individual educated Indians who should be allowed to go to any Dominion, it is recognised that by-making an arrangement of this kind Japan has been able to come to a settlement with Canada which puts Japanese on a privileged position.15. To attain a settlement of these grievances it is necessary to recognise, in the first place, that they are in a great measure matters of sentiment. Indians in their outlook upon the Empire are at present powerfully swayed by two ideas.    They are proud of the fact that they are British subjects and their country an integral portion of the Empire.   They wish to claim their Imperial privileges, and they do not understand why on the ground of race they are unfairly excluded from large tracts of the Empire, and worse treated in some matters than Asiatics who do not belong to the Empire, while (until the, passing of the new United States Immigration Law) they have not met with unfavourable differential treatment in the territories of foreign Powers.   They are at the same time proud of their Indian nationality, of their ancient civilisation, and of the great intellectual traditions which they have inherited.   They are deeply moved by treatment which imputes to them ignorance or implies denial of these titles to respect.   They have made sacrifices for the Empire ; they have proved their loyalty, their courage, and their fortitude; and they will ask that all this should be recognised. Thus sentiment and imagination enter largely into the controversy.   If the Dominions would make concessions which would meet feelings of this order, they would probably find that India would not desire to be exacting on material points.&quot;   The unrestricted opening to Indian enterprise of any territory acquired from the enemy in East Africa would, it is believed, remove some of the bitterness which this controversy has engendered in the minds of Indian publicists and politicians by the proof it would give that in the disposal of territories accreted to the Empire the needs of the Indian&quot; peoples have not been overlooked.1(3. With these principles in mind, it is suggested that the basis of an agreement might be sought on the folloAving lines : (I) As regards Indians already permanently settled in the Dominions, they should be allowed to bring in wives (subject to the rule of
monogamy) atid; M0Teii,- aird iir other respects should not be less privileged than Jftpanbse settled immigrants.(2) Future admissions of Indians for labour or settlement should, if possible, be regulated on Jines similar to, and not more unfavourable than, those governing the admission of any other Asiatic race.(3) If this is not possible, there might be reciprocal treatment in India and each Dominion of immigration for purposes of labour or permanent settlement. If a Dominion is determined to exclude these two classes of- immigration from India. India should be free to do the same as regards that Dominion. It would he clearly recognised that the exclusion in either case was not motived by prejudices of race, but was the outcome of different economic conditions.(I) Along with such exclusion reciprocal arrangements would be made for granting full facilities for the admission of tourists, students, and the like, and for business visits entailing temporary residence, so long as this residence was not for labour purposes or for permanent settlement.India Office, v22nd March 1917.
