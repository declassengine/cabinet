Those sailing- from Southampton have been used on various occasions for eon-voyance of Rod Cross Stores and R.A.M.C personnel to Franco, but never for munitions of war cr ecm-batant troops.   The witnesses were not in a position to Judge the d?if-ferenoo in the draft of the vessels accurately.

He saw the -00 men inarch, off in military foriaa-cn at Southampton wearing ordinary . ixcru but expressly says that they :1 no arras or luggage with them.   He 30 says 150 officers were carried, a^ing .their ordinary uniforms andtheir arms hanging up near -Qir beds and suggests they xmre ^fectly so far as ho could see.Answers. -Annexe 11.\Statements as to movements of &quot;Wandilla&quot; are correct up to heriarrival at Mudros on 28th Oct. but!the subsequent dates both in caseof&apos; this ship and of the &quot;Britanniaare incorrectly stated.   &quot;Wandilla!only reraained 1 day at M-udrostthe&quot;Britannic&quot; arrived at Mudros on28th (not 31st) Oct. &amp; the cargowas transferred from &quot;Britannic&quot;to &quot;Wandilla&quot;(not vice versa) andconsisted as the orderly is stater&apos;;to havesaid of Red Cross Stores *&quot;Britannic&quot; left Mudros on 30thOct.(not 1 Nov.) and arrived at-Southampton on 5th(not 7th) Nov,Total No. of cases carried by&quot;Britannic&quot; on this voyage wasas follows :-Naval cot cases 3, Other 21 Military Cot Gases 364-Other cases 2634.Total 3022,The non-cot oases consisted of men who could walk and werewearing their ordinary clothes.The diet of these men was probablyquite different from that of thecot cases.

Annexe 12* This is merely a report by a ondon Agent to a German Intelli-91109 Officer at Antwerp that ospital ships are frequently -sod for transporting- &quot;jsassen-ers&quot; to Prance (Nov.16).Annexe 13* A report by an unnamed Doctor if a conversation in a train be-wen Paris and Rouen in May 1915 fhen a British officer said the -roops had come over in a red .ross ship.Annexes, 14 &amp; 16.Re &quot;Formosa&quot; a British Hos-iital ship at Cardiff.

A Dutch Merchant says vhat in Dec. 1915 300 infantry n marching order (whether arms &apos;&apos;-re carried is not stated) ^barked, besides 50 navalicers.J62Answers-. . Annexe 12. Is denied.Annexe 1-5. The statement if made is false.Annexes 14 &amp; 16.The &quot;Formosa&quot; arrived at Cardiff on 2nd Jan. 1916 and left on 13th. The &quot;troops&quot; referred to were -probably the R.A.M.O. Staff in uniform.     It is suggested that the &quot;naval officers&quot; may havo been officers of the Transport Dept. who visited the ship i&apos;i connection with repairs.&quot;Formosa&quot; was at Belfast from 16 Nov. to 30 Dec.  1915 and did not arrive at Cardiff until 2nd Jan. 1916.

We have no Hospital Shipof 12,000 to 14,000 tons belonging to Pacific Steam Navigation Co., and so far as oan be traced no British Hospital ship of this size was at or nea,r Gibraltar on 19th Sept. 1915-.     A repert has been called for from Gibraltar.     A defensively armed merchantman painted alijl colour was probably mistaken for a Hospital ship.The liedioal staff of Hospital ships and any R.A.M.C-. details on board as passengers as well as any Walking cases oonve7/ed are always in Khaki uniform and this may account for many of the statements as to Troops,The number of Hospital snips employed was not excessive and sometimes it was found necessary to use ordinary Transports in addition.     They were used exclusively for conveyance of invalids, though sometimes reliefs for the R-,A-.m,C. were carried. In only a few cases has it been necessary to replace ships on list of Hospital ships after having been removed from the list.Admj..ralty,3rd April 1917.
