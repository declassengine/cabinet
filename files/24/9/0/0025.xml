MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, March 28, 1917.. . PART I-ACTION TAKEN. .Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.The Food Controller has made an Order, dated the 28th March, continuing until; the 30th June 1917, the existing prohibition of the export of oats and potatoes from. Ireland.   The Order may be cited as the Oats and Potatoes (Ireland) Order, 1917.A summary of Orders in force on the 25th March 1917, with a chronological list of such Orders and of Orders no longer in force is circulated with this Report.Control of Prices and Supplies.Bread, Flour, and Breadstuffs. -It has been decided that bakers who hold (under licence) stocks of imported (white) flour will only be allowed to use white flour if mixed at the rate of 20 per cent, with regulation flour. This decision will reduce unfair competition as regards the colour of bread. - J?.l1The use of flour and maize for industrial purpose, now amounting; to about. 300,000 tons per annum, is being close]y investigated with ;a view to its enforced reduction.      .  - ..      .* ^rioC. -.-!. ;.      ,;       :      &apos;Milk-It was announced in the Press on Monday,.March 26, that the prices to: be fixed next winter would be considered by the Agricultural Departments in good time before the period for making contracts&apos;so as to make the maintenance of milk production certain and commercially profitable in comparison with other branches of the farming industry. . &quot; /It was further announced that the Price of Milk Order, 1917, would be amended so as to base the increase of price thereby sanctioned on the summer prices of 1914 instead of on those of 1913.       - - .  :   .Meantime the division between wholesalers and retailers in London of the \lrd. per gallon which represents the available margin of profit is causing some difficulty, and conferences are being held in the hope of effecting a satisfactory settlement.Fish. The Food Controller has appointed a representative on the Committee formed by the Board of Agriculture to consider practical means of increasing the supply of sea fish, in order that the advice of the Committee may be made available: in any matter affecting fish supply.,. , &apos; &apos;.;Sugar. It was announced on Monday, March 26, that the Food Controller had appointed a Departmental Committee to inquire into the whole system and method of sugar distribution in order to ascertain what steps or means are essential to ensure the public getting even and constant supplies. The Chairman of the Committee is Lord Somerleyton, and the other members are Mr. A. Richardson, M.P., Mr. T. R. Ferens, M.P., Mr. B. H. Burton, Mr. H. G. Emery, Mr. A. J.. Giles, Mr. C. H. Liddell, and Mr. H. J. May. Captain S. G. Tallents is Secretary to the Committee. The Committee meet daily at Grosvenor House.The inspection of areas in which there appears to have been a substantial increase of population since 1915 has been continued, and in 59 cases additional grants have been recommended. .Tea and Coffee. Further conferences have ,been held with representatives of all branches of the tea trade, and arrangements are well in hand for a supply to the public after May 1st at lower prices than those now ruling. The question of insisting on net weight of tea being supplied, to customers in place of the present practice of including the weight of wrappers is under consideration.A  (33)2716-2   Pk i   50   3j17&apos; E &amp; g A
Provisions.-The Home and Foreign Produce Exchange on March 23rd fixed, at the instance of the.Food Controller, the current.maximum prices for all classes of provisions after previous consultation with delegates from air parts of the United Kingdom. There is every reason to believe that this arrangement will secure a steady supply from the producer and a reasonable price to the consumer.Potatoes. The appeal of the Food Controller to the well-to-do classes to abstain from eating potatoes has had a marked effect on their consumption in the more expensive hotels and restaurants. The institution of pOtatoless days in West-End clubs has now become general, and some clubs have eliminated potatoes from their meals altogether.Brewing and Malting.Final returns showing the amount of barley in possession of brewers and maltsters on March 10th, as compared with the stock held on February .10th, have now been received. After allowing for the quantity used in the manufacture of malt for brewing beer, distilling, malt extracts, vinegar, &amp;c, during the intervening month, the figures show a 5 per cent, decrease.Food Economy.The Food Controller stated in the House of Lords on Thursday, March 22nd, that, he had in hand the organisation of a food economy campaign, which had started and would become more active week by week.: It had been, he added, organised in association with the National War Savings Committee, and the object was to penetrate every class, and to cover the country in a systematic way.A scheme of suggestions for the utilisation of the machinery of the National War Savings Committee was drawn up and approved by the Ministry and circulated on the 24th inst. Arrangements for the active co-operation of the War Savings Committee and the Ministry are being developed.It was announced oh Monday, March 26th, that, with the approval; of the Prime Minister, Mr. Kennedy Jones, M.P., had been appointed Director-General (unpaid) of the Food Economy Department, of the; Ministry of Food.Meetings are already held daily in and around London, at which the Directors of-Women&apos;s Service are present and speak. The meeting at Drury Lane Theatre on Monday, March 26th, was attended by some 3,000 domestic workers.The Food Controller has approved of the institution of a central kitchen for collective cooking, under, the control of a committee on which the Lady.Directors will serve for the purpose of. instructing the public how, by careful buying, systematic treating, and good cooking, food may be made to yield the maximum of nutrition with the minimum of- waste.PART II.-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION. . - &apos;. Imports. .&apos;, -Imports of food during the week ended March 24, though not at so low a level as in the preceding week, have been unsatisfactory. For the principal foods and feeding stuffs shown in Table A. they amount altogether to 180,737 tons. This compares with 147,794 during the week ended March 17, 274,812 during the corresponding-week of 1916, and 198,124 as the average for the first 12 weeks of 1917.The total imports for the 12 weeks of the present year amount to 2,377,494 tons, against 2,866,017 in the corresponding period of 1916, showing a decrease of 488,523 tons or 17 per cent. Of this decrease, 281,625 tons are due to the smaller imports of barley, oats, and maize.As compared with the average weekly imports during the 12 weeks ending March 24th, the imports in the last week of the period show a deficiency in every case, except barley, maize, and sugar. The deficiency is particularly conspicuous in the case of wheat, rice, beef, mutton, hams, and butter.&apos;For the first 12 weeks of the year, as compared with the corresponding period of 1916, the imports of margarine, cheese,;and butter show some increase. All the other -articles show a decrease, which is most marked in the case of barley, oats, sugar, ^bacbrifhams, and rice. Attention is -directed in a footnote to the table to the effect that the re-exports- of rice in the present year are on a much lower scale thandast &quot;year,; but even so the supplies of this important commodity are how much below requirements. v- V; r-:  ---- &apos;      ... -
- &apos; ^Z&apos;UUr- -     Stocks.-; &apos;       - :v-Wlieat. -The stocks. on March 26th are estimated .at. 1,231,000 tons as compared with 1,430,000 tons on the corresponding date in 191(5, and 1,397,000 tons on March 1st, 1917.   - &quot;       . :;       &apos;   \       .   .        ^Barley-The stocks on March 26th, apart from stocks in maltsters&apos; hands, are estimated at 153,000 tons as compared with 180,000 tons on March 1st. Stocks in maltsters&apos; hands on the .10th March have been returned at 310,000 tons.   \Oa.ts.-The stocks on March 26th are estimated at 614,000 tons, as compared with 919,000 tons on March 1st. ... ... Maize. The stocks on March 26th are estimated at 176,000 tons against 195,000 tons on March 1st. .- Consumption.Meat-Table B gives certain figures illustrating the rate of consumption of meat this year as compared with last year. The supplies entering the Central Market, London, which showed a very substantial decrease during January and February, as compared with the corresponding supplies last year, sliowed a slight increase during the first: week in March, and only a very slight decrease during the second week, but the returns for the week ending March 24th. again show a heavy fall amounting to 16*9 per cent. For the Manchester and Glasgow markets the returns can only be carried up to the week ending March 17th. The Manchester market shows a fall of 17&quot;5 per cent. for.the week ending March 10th, and a fall of 10:9 per cent, for the week ending March 17th. The figures for the Glasgow market, on the other hand, for these two Weeks, show practically no change as compared with last year. - Taking the three markets together, the supplies in January were 8&apos;4 per cent, and those in February 18&apos;3 per cent below the corresponding figures for 1916, but for the first two weeks of: March the decrease is only 0&apos;5 per cent. For the first three weeks of March London figures give a decrease &apos; of 5 per cent.. . The supplies of fat stock at certain markets in Great Britain (Table C) for the three weeks ending March 21st, as compared with the average of 1914-16, show,a small increase amounting to 1&apos;3 per cent, in the case of cattle, a slight fall amounting &apos;to 2&apos;4 in the case of sheep, and a heavy fall amounting to lj&quot;8 per cent, in the case .of pigs. As the returns for January and for February showed decreases in cattle and . sheep as well as in pigs when comparison was made with the three years&apos;average, these returns also suggest some check in the decrease of consumption.Bread. Information has been asked for from the National Association of Master &apos; Bakers and Confectioners as to the amount of flour used for bread-making by the principal members of the Council of the Association.^ The full Returns have not yet /been received, but the Secretary states that a considerable number of Returns which have been received &quot;seem to show that, as compared With February, .1916, there was a slight increase both for the four weeks ending February 3 and March 3, 1917. &quot; These increases may be due partly to the cold weather of the last few months, &quot;&quot;because cold weather always increases bread consumption, but are no doubt &quot; mainly due to shortage of potatoes.&quot;-i - Wholesale Prices.In Table D, the latest wholesale prices for wheat, barley, oats and mutton, show some increase as compared with the figures of the week before. In most other cases there is little change; but in the case of tea no comparison can be made owing to the absence of sales during the previous week. When comparison is made with the prices of a month ago, mutton shows a conspicuous rise amounting to as much as 10 per cent, in the case of English, and 6 per cent, in the case of. Argentine; rice shows a rise of 7 per cent.; oats, wheat and flour increases of about 5 per cent., and tea an increase of between 3 per cent, and 4 per cent. Prices of cottonseed, of palm kernels, and of linseed cake show a slight fall. .If the comparison be made with the prices of a year ago, oats, maize and cheese show increases of 50 per cent, or 60, per cent.; wheat, rice, beef and tea increases of 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, while in the case of mutton the increase is approximately 30 per cent., and in the case of bacon 36 per cent.     ...,.,a 2
Retail Prices,The Report of the Ministry of Food for the week ending Wednesday, March 14th, contained statistics as to retail prices at the end of February compared with the previous month and with a year ago.It may be of interest to add to this information material for reviewing the general course of retail prices since the outbreak of war.   This is afforded by the attached Table E. showing the increase of prices at six-monthly intervals and at the beginning of January, February and March 1917, expressed in every case as a percentage of the normal price in July 1914.It will be seen that on an average retail prices at March 1st, 1917, were 92 per cent, above the prices in July 1914.   The articles which have risen most are sugar (171 per cent.), frozen mutton (breast) (147 per cent.), chilled or frozen beef (thin flank) (124 per cent.), fish (122 per cent.), eggs (118 per cent.) and potatoes (118 per cent.).   Those which have risen least are margarine (36 per cent.), tea (58 per cent.) and milk (60 per cent.).The rate of increase from month to month has naturally varied, but taking six-monthly periods together, has been fairly steady.The average rate of increase per month expressed as a percentage of the prices at 1914 has been as follows : July-December, 1914    -     -     -      - -3*0January-June, 1915      -     -     ^     -     -     -   2&apos;4 .   July-December, 1915    -     - r-  --     -21January-June, 1916      -      - -      -      -   2*6July-December, 1916    -     -     -     -     -     -  2&apos;7January, 1917 -   2&apos;0f  . February, 1917     -      -     -     - -     -   3&quot;3The average over the whole period is 2&apos; 6. The actual rate of increase in January is thus below the average, and that in February considerably above the average. This is the more noticeable because in previous Februaries (owing no doubt to seasonal causes) the rate of increase has been below the average. The increase of 3 * 3 for February 1917, compares with 1&quot;5 for February 1916.This relates to all the principal foodstuffs taken together. Particular articles during the last two months have naturally shown rates of increase much above the average, the highest in February being cheese (19 per cent, of July 1914 prices); frozen mutton (breast) (13&apos; 1 per cent.); bacon (12&apos; 7 per cent.); margarine (6&apos; 9 per cent.); tea (6&apos; 1 per Cent.). ;Much the most marked recent increases in food prices, however, have taken place, not in regard to the principal foods included in the table, but in regard to subsidiary foods such as beans, lentils, peas, oatmeal, rice, sago, and tapioca. This is strikingly shown in the attached Table F. During the 30 months from July, 1914, to December 1916. the prices of these subsidiary foods increased on an average at about the same rate as ihe principal foods (2&apos;8 as compared with 2*6). In January they jumped by 10&apos;9 per cent, of the pre-war price (as compared with 2*0 for the principal foods), and in February by 31&apos; 4 per cent.&apos; (as compared with 3&apos; 3 per cent.). Since March 1st they are known in many cases to have continued to rise rapidly. This rise is no doubt due partly to restriction of imports, and partly to increased demand for the subsidiary articles as substitutes for wheat, meat, and potatoes.

The Order came into force on December 14th, 1916. The operation of the Order has now been extended (by the Seed Potatoes (Prices) Order, 1917) from March 15th to the 31st of March, 1917.(2) Potatoes (Ireland) Order, 1916 (18th December, 1916).-This Order prohibits the export of potatoes from Ireland without the permission of the Department of Agriculture.

This Order . replaces the previous Potatoes Main Crop (Prices) Order, and gives effect to. the deci-sion of the War Cabinet in regard to the prices that may be charged on sales of various kinds. The main effect is to fix the growers&apos; price at  9 per ton to the end of March, and  10 per ton thereafter, except when he sells to a retailer, when the price is  10 10s. per ton to the end of March, and  11 10s. per ton thereafter.
