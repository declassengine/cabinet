SECRET.0. 1/92/268.SITUATION AT SALONIKA.I. The War Cabinet at their meeting on 30th March last adversely criticised the conduct of the operations in Macedonia by the French and British Commanders, and the opinion was expressed that a state of &quot; discreditable inactivity &quot; prevailed in that theatre.As the War Cabinet are aware, it was decided at the Rome Conference that all the Allied Commanders should conform to the orders of General Sarrail, and therefore the responsibility for the conduct of operations rests primarily with that officer. I wish, however, to state the case as far as the British forces are concerned.2. General Sarrails plan of campaign last autumn was to operate by his left flank in the direction of Monastir, and he accordingly concentrated on that flank as large a force as he could make available and decided to act defensively on the remainder of the front. The British force, which at that time consisted of five divisions, was allotted a front of 90 miles, extending from Orfano Bay on the right to the Vardar on the left. This enormous extent of front quite precluded General Milne from keeping any reserves in his own hands, and consequently prevented him from undertaking any serious offensive operations against an enemy who was at least equal in numbers and was strongly entrenched. To have attempted any such operations would have been criminal.3. Later, during the winter months, operations on any considerable scale have been rendered inpossible by climatic conditions, and especially so because the winter has, as everywhere else, been of exceptional length and severity. Activity has there-fore necessarily been confined to raids and other minor operations, and these I may observe have been out of all proportion greater on the British front than on any other portion of the Allied line, Further, the wide extent of front held by the British army, the roadless and mountainous condition of the country, and the absence of railways, have made it necessary to carry out an abnormal amount of work on the improvement and maintenance of communications. This has been done with commendable energy. Four lines of railways have been laid, and new roads have been constructed in circumstances of exceptional difficulty, and throughout the winter some 10,000 men have been employed on the construction and maintenance of the Salonika Serres road alone, which is the main channel of communication with our Struma front.4. During the winter a sixth division joined the British force. For some weeks one brigade of this division was detached by General Sarrail to Thessally, but has now rejoined, and for the first time for many months General Milne has now a small reserve at his disposal.X trust that the above explanation of the case may cause the War Cabinet to modify the opinion expressed as to the lack of activity on the part of the British Commander and his troops.5. I think it necessary, and more particularly so as the War Cabinet are not satisfied with the present state of affairs, to take this opportunity to refer to our policy at Salonika, which was decided upon at the recent Calais Conference and approved by the War Cabinet on 25th February last.   It is as follows : &quot; As the co-operation of the Russo-Boumanian forces against Bulgaria is not yet possible, the Conference agrees to confirm the decision of the Home Conference, and decides that for the present the decisive defeat of the Bulgarian Army is not a practical objective, and that the mission of the Allied forces at Salonika is to keep on their front the enemy forces now there and to take advantage of striking the enemy if opportunity offers.&quot;This decision was communicated to Generals Sarrail and Milne, and their future plans have, presumably, been based upon it. I do not know the details of General SarraiTs plans, nor do I know the date on which he proposes to begin offensive(B17/246)   50  4/17   H&amp;S  4359wo
operations, but I have been informed by General Milne of the general scope of the plans and of the role allotted to the British forces. - For some time past General Milne has been preparing to carry out the mission allotted to him by General Sarrail.6. It is common knowledge tnat the Salonika Expedition has been a failure from the start. This was foreseen by the General Staff of the day, and I, myself, have repeatedly stated that the expedition had no military justification, and would in all probability never produce military results in any way commensurate with the expenditure of force entailed. I still think so, and it is lamentable to remember that, when shipping is so valuable, and when both France and ourselves are so short of men, we should each have some 200,000 men locked up in a distant theatre where they are unlikely to be able to give any material assistance towards the winning of the war. I am much afraid that the troops themselves than whom there are no better judges  may know this to be the case, and that their morale will be detrimentally affected by the knowledge. Nothing is more destructive of fighting efficiency than for troops to be employed in abortive enterprises, nor are matters much improved by engaging in scratch operations for the sake, of preserving morale, to say nothing of useless loss of life. General Milne, with whom I have several times communicated on the subject, is alive to the danger and has taken steps to avoid it, but, in circumstances like those here in question, it is impossible to keep up a proper fighting spirit indefinitely.The maintenance of the force is also a great drain upon our man-power because of the bad climate. Last summer no less than 90,000 men were incapacitated by disease, or a total of 75 per cent, of the whole force, and of these 37,000 men had to be sent out of the country. With the one exception of East Africa, the area in which we are operating in Macedonia, is the most unhealthy of any in which our troops are employed. General Milne has reported that the medical authorities consider we must be prepared for, at least, an equal wastage during the coming summer.I would also remind the War Cabinet that the Admiralty have expressed the opinion that the strain upon our naval and shipping resources is becoming unendurable, and that, from a naval point of view, it would be less disadvantageous to have the enemy established at Salonika than to be compelled to provide the naval force and shipping required for the maintenance of our forces there.7. It is conceivable perhaps that, if we achieve good successes in other theatres during the forthcoming summer, it may be possible for the Salonika force to exert such local pressure on the Bulgars as to cause them to negotiate for peace, but we cannot hope, unless some extraordinary change occurs in the situation, to gain any far-reaching military success in the Balkans, such, for example, as to establish and maintain ourselves on the main line of communications between Austria and Turkey. It would, of&quot; course, be a great advantage if we could detach Bulgaria from the Central Powers, but the chance of doing this seems remote, and this chance is the only justification for the con-tinuance of our occupation of Macedonia, with the exception of the bad effect that would be produced on the Serbians and possibly on other Allies if we abandoned our present policy and decided to withdraw the Salonika force.8. Whether this is now feasible is a matter for the War Cabinet to consider. The only alternatives to it are the present policy and one which would confine our action to the defence of the town and harbour of Salonika, all troops not required for that purpose being withdrawn. There is ample scope for the profitable employment in Palestine of any British troops that could be got away, and the results to be obtained there are likely to contribute far more to winning the war than anything which we can achieve in the Balkans.Chief of the Imperial General Staff,War Office,2nd April, 1917.

The strain on our naval and shipping resources due to the Salonika Expedition has been frequently pointed out by me, and I have also stated that we should suffer fewer shipping losses in Home Waters if the force at Salonika were reduced, because we could then afford to bring home some of the patrol craft. We could also afford more protection to Mediterranean shipping.The statement of the C.I.G.S. in regard to the number of sick that will require removal is most disquieting and it is exceedingly doubtful whether it will be in the least degree possible to cope with the figures given. If our hospital ships are attacked in the Mediterranean, as in Home Waters, it is quite certain that we cannot deal with this number of sick.The opinions already expressed by me in regard to Salonika are once more, reiterated.J. R. J.Admiralty.2nd April, 1917.APPENDIX.
