SECRET G.T.315-p.WAR CABIHEg0 PERAI I QMS,SECRET.Prom:- General Haribury-Williams.March 27th, 1S17To:-    CI.G.S. No.9S0.This morning I had an interview with Polivanoff,     I told him that I was anxious to have an opportunity of getting verbal expression of opinion regarding the situation in Petrograd and his views regarding the position generally. I said that we knew each other sufficiently well for him to be aware that I was most anEious to do nothing here but what would help the Government and (? still more) the success of the Russian Army.He said that in difficulties such as wewerenow passing  &quot;t through the great thing is to be calm, to be English in fact. When first the troubles began he at once offered his services to the Government and is now being used as sort of intermediary between the Government on the one hand and workmen and Army on the other.     Difficulty about recruits was the mistake that they had been assembled in large numbers at various centres, but through lack of railway facilities it had been impossible to send them to depots where they could be properly organised and disciplined.     He thought the formation of 60 (? division) s also a mistake:   ov/ing to shortage of staff officers they should be left as battalions.     He expected to persuade Alexeieff to alter this.He thought that Alexeieff1 s order about shooting all men who created disturbances was wrong.   He quite saw that strong measures and discipline were required bftt the situation was delicate and required tact.     He suggested that order should be read that men suspected of being spies should be tried at once by court-martial.    Alexeieff1s order was having bad effect and might have     dangerous results;   he hoped that everything
possible would be done to induce Alexeieff to alter this. 66 Grand Duke Nicholas entirely agreed with him. He had now got Petrograd Press Bureau in hand and said that their representatives were playing thegame.      Workmen and soldiers had been much alarmed by rumours (one group undecipherable^ in support of old regime going about Petrograd, he had spoken to them and told them to take-no notice of such reports.     I asked him about the provisioning of Petrograd asI gathered that there was lately free distribution and did not understand whether that would continue or would there be again a hungry mob and its dangers&apos;.He agreed that the position caused some anxiety but everything possible was being done and he hoped that the new organisation v/ould be successful.I assured him that I and my colleagues were doing all in our power to support the New Government and that we should continue to do so.     It was obvious from both Russian and Allies point of view that we should act thus.He says that he has explained the danger of German attack on Riga (said to be developing) to the workmen and other delegates and had warned them that their position would be worse under German success than it was now.He is sanguine of success of his work and expressed himself as confident of our support.One of Alexeieff1s staff officers, Colonel Bazaaroff, came to see me afterwards to enquire if my conversation with General Pfclivanoff had been satisfactory.     I said &quot;yes&quot;, as far as it went.     I found that Polivanoff was optimistic though worried about Alexeieffs Army Order.     I said that although I agreed with Polivanoffs point of view, the question of discipline was not my business.   Also it was not my custom to be carried away by the views of the last man I happened to be with.     I said that I had considered this question and my views were that the order should be changed.
Bazaaroff said that Alexeieff was averse to changing orders once issued.     He had made it a condition of acceptance of his present appointment that Rasputin should never come to head-quarters and this condition had &quot;been strictly observed. In agreeingwith Alexeieff&apos;s view, I maintained my view that a &quot;modus Vivendi&quot; could be found by wording new order in such a way as to show that the death sentence would be awarded only after trial and proof that accused was spy or the equivalent.I suggested that a good lawyer could contrive this with-out any loss of dignity for Alexeieff.     I said that it was my intention not to mention such a delicate matter to Alexe-ieff but I did so only on account of my friendly relations with the General.     Bazaaroff quite agreed and waid that he would see officers simply attached to Alexeieff for legal advice at once, as it was most important that this order should be changed as bad feeling was undoubtedly being created by it.Repeated to Ambassador.
