3jC EB T., WAR. CABIIISQ?.G, I1. -3 85. THE   BUS SUIT   REVOIUTIOU.( Memorandum by Mr.George Bury. )The Revolution in Russia lasted, for about eight day; It &quot;began on Thursday the 8th.March.There was a general dissatisfaction of the Russian people with the Government and a great hatred of the Russian Police, whose drastic methods are well-known.The Revolution was due to a shortage of food.Prior to the Revolution, for seme time, the people had to wait in long lines for &quot;bread and then were only able to secure but a small dole, .  The priee^of food had been growing at a tremendous rate and it&quot;is not an exaggeration to say that many of tho workpeople wore on the verge of starvation.The food shortage was brought about from the Inadequate transportation system of Russia, hampered by a very severe winter, to the fixing of maximum.prices and partly tc people endeavouring to make undue profits.The Revolution was confined-mainly to Petrograd and tho Havy. .   There was little, if any, disturbance elsewhere throughout Russia.     It was freely stated and is generally believed throughout Russia, that the Government desired to provoke the people, expecting to chastise them and then have an excuse for a separate Peace.     Whether this is true or not, it is accepted generally by all classes of the people.While the Russian people were short of food, it is alleged that the Army was well cared for, but, before leaving Russia, I was advised on rather good authority, that the food supply for the Army was beginning to cause &quot;some anxiety,Due - to lack of raw materials, many - of the-factories in the vicinity of Petrograd were closed&apos; and these workmen marched into the city, crying for bread        without making any great demonstration.The police had placed a number of machine guns, on roofs in commanding positions throughout the city.     It was stated that 5,000 had recently been received from America and   1 that 2,00C had been tinned over to the police.     when II, Protopopov gave himself up ho handed the Duma a list of the places where these machine guns had been placed and it is no exaggeration to say that there were at least 1,200. so placed in Petrograd alone.On the first day (Thursday) the Cossacks were used with the police to break up the mobs but they seemed to&apos;lean on the side of the people.     One of them !brained1 a mounted policeman who had been unnecessarily cruel.
On Friday the demonstrations were somewhat similar tc the day &quot;before and there was much action on the part of.the police hut without any sanguinary results.On the Saturdayj  in the factory regions, heavy fight-ing developed by the workmen on the one side as against the police and soldi-efcy. Bombs were thrown and weapons used freely. The police acted with disgusting savagery and towards the evening a row developed between the Cossacks and the police, which resulted in the Cossacks turning their arms against the police, who fled and were killed freely.&apos;Sunday was comparatively quiet but on that day it was spread around that the sittings- of&apos;the   Duma had been post-pened. -During Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday it developed into a fight between the police and the&apos; soldiery.    The soldiers were principally recruits and I believe&apos;it was just a pure accident that made them join the people and that it had not been pre-arranged.    The soldiers disarmed their officers,, killed a number of them and undertook to ferret out and kill the police.    The police,  tn their part^&apos;- used their machine guns on the soldiers and people at every opportunity.Beginning with the Monday, the Motor Transports, Motor Cars and Armoured Cars were running all ever the city, loaded with soldiers, heoligans- and workmen and shonting was going on very generally.    Pield. guns were laid across some of the Streets,   Every police station was ransacked and all the records burned.    The records -were taken from the Court, of Justice,  a bonfire made and. then the interior of it was burned.The prisons were opened and Political prisoners and criminals alike set at liberty.    1t is stated that most of the criminals have since been incarcerated.Heavy firing was almost continuous on Monday,  Tuesday and Wednesday,    The Revolutionary forces had secured large numbers of machine guns, which they used freely.    Shops were looted and itj some of them,  large stores of rifles and ammunition were found,  as well as quite a stock of food-stuffs.Tho Astoria Hotel had been used for the Military. An undertaking,  it appears, was given to the Revolutionary Party that there would be no shooting from it.    Some unwise officer fired, with the result that it was immediately attack-ed and the lower part of it completely-smashed, bullets were fired indiscriminately and the soldiers killed a, number of the officers, making a rather bad mess.   A machine gun wa3 found ambushed on the top floor.There was very little liquor to be had, which was one of the reasons that the casualties were not greater.Battalions that had been posted to guard Public buildings in many cases handed, their arms over to the mob. There were a number of fights between&apos; various regiments of soldiers and-between the soldiers and sailors.
-    O    -411It would appear that on the Tuesday the Members of the Duma attempted to take control of tho situation and&quot; a Committee of Public Safety endeavoured to restore order..Tho rivers and canals in the vicinity of Petrograd are covered with ico.   At many intervals thoro arc water-holes cut for the use of laundresses and many Of tho killed -principally tho policemen - were just pushed under the ico and allowed to float out.During the Revolution, foreigners were not molested and any killed were through accident.There was a very good feeling apparent to?/ards the English.   I am advised that six months before, tho feeling towards the English was bad and on all sides the Russians attribute the change in sentiment during six months to the work of our Ambassador there,As to the casualties, in view of the burning of the records, it would be impossible to ever get at then accurately but Mo Keller of the Workmen1s Delegates and&apos;M, Hakludoff of the Duma,. estimated the deaths at at least 5,600 and of course the casualties many times greater.It was the rule in the past, when men were injured in such demonstrations, not to permit them to be taken to the hospitals but while this rule was broken when the soldiers came into control&apos;, there is no doubt that at tho start tho injured wore simply taken to their homos0There was an entire absence of discipline among tho troopsn   They killed their officers freely, disarmed others and these were compelled to wear rod ribbons to show that they belonged to tho Hovelution.     Certain regulations Wore issued respecting saluting;   the officers were to be chosen by the men themselves; separate tables for officers were abolished and in other ways discipline was killed.     It was stated that the discipline at the Pront had not been interfered with but the Generals there telegraphed to Petrograd to the Duma to send down men to explain to tho soldiers the necessity of discipline.In the Uavy a number of the officers were killed and many were simply.pushed under the ico and drowned.At Eolsingfors more than half the officers were disposed cf and an ordinary seaman was elected as Admiral of the Pieet.Tho majority of those now forming the Government of Russia are the ablest men that they havo and the Premier -Prince Lvoff -.has proved himself to be a capable organiser and the Minister of Ways and Communications - iic&quot;Hecaooff -his lieutenant, strikes one as.an able, fearless, conscientious man.I saw Prince toff and M. ITocasoff after they had taken over the Government and asked the Prince what message. I might bring to Englandc     He said that the Government was like 1 straws on a turbulent stream1 but that they had strong hcoes of becoming T.firmly.fixed -in the saddle1..     He stated that&quot; the troubles/were mainly confined, now tp Petrograd, that the Revolutionaries, Socialists and other extremists were con-tinually sending out manifestos of all kinds but that.their efforts were abortive outside of Potrograd.
The Russians had been held in subjection - mainly through the Police System - for centuries.   Although they are a ITatien of surprises1 it seems certain&apos;that there will be a great deal more bloodshed,     The only thing that&apos; is lively to stop it for the present is a Military reverse, which, I believe, would.have tho effect of cementing them.From tslkin^ to men in every walk: ef life and all the information I was able to - get, it would appear that the majority of the people are filled with the desire to con-tinue the War,I would adviso that wo figure the future&quot;on the assumption that Russia will be but littlo help.   The most we can expect is that they will hold their present&quot;lines, backing up every time a serious offensive is triod.   I believe Germany will make . every&apos; effort to whip Prussia, and that she will take Petrograd.     I do not think she can conquer Russia but I regard as certain the fall of the Capital in the next year, mainly through the inefficiency of the Russian Fleeto     But the fall of Petrograd will not prevent the Russians finally driving the Germans out of all Russia with exception of Poland. ..I know nothing about Military matters, but, in Civil life, in large corporations, once discipline has been impaired it takes a long time to restore it and it is certain that the lack of discipline has seriously impaired the effec-tivenoss of the Army and particularly of the ITavyc(Signed)     GEORGE 3TJRY,London.5th April, 1917,
