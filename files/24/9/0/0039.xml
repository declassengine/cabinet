Report of Lieut-Colonel Plunkett after his second visit to Salonica front.   1st - 14th March.During the first fortnight in March I visited French Army Headquarters at Fiorina (S. of Monastir), Serbian Army Headquarters at Salonica,  and 12th Corps Headquarters on the Lake Doiran - Vardar front.Practically the only change in the situation since my previous visit to Salonica in January was that the French Army had received reinforcements and General Grossett had taken over command of the French Army with new General Staff officers and a new Group Commander General Bouq a young man of the permanent rank of Colonel,  was in command of the troops in the Monastir region. General Sarrail and his Army Commanders.Lt. Gen. Milne expressed the view that Sarrail repre-sented the stumbling block to effective co-operation of the different armies on the Salonica Front,  and the general feeling in Salonica gave me,  as before,  the impression that over and above the preparations for an offensive as soon as the weather permitted,  there was still in the background a certain amount of political wire-pulling and pegging out of claims going on.I  spent 3 days at General Grossetti&apos;s Headquarters at Fiorina, where I gained a totally different impression from that produced in Salonica.   The French Army. Jommander is a man of exceptional energy, who visits the different parts of his front regardless of distances,  weather,  or his own convenience,  and is in direct personal touch with every-thing that goes on.The Italians are now under the orders of Grossetti, so that a, far as the Aray Colanders gothe state 0fSECRET.. G.T. 338.WAR CABINET.
affairs is much improved from a year ago when the French Army was commanded by a weak man who thought much of his own comfort and had his Headquarters a long way in rear of the troops.     I consider that Grossetti can be relied on this Summer to carry through the offensive on the Monastir flank to the utmost possible extent, if the matter rests with him.     The Serbian and British Army Commanders are on the best of terms and hold the same general views regarding the situation.Co-operation,  if required at a latter date, between the British and Serbians should be excellent, unless hampered by the direction of Sarrail.The recent capture of Point 1248 and other points dominating Monastir from which the town was continually under view and. fire, is a good augury for the Summer operations.   Point 1248 is a rocky peak at the extremity of a long and high ridge, and when at Monastir I heard the opinion expressed that this and other similar positions were too strong to attack, and that the Bulgarian positions would be turned by outflanking movements,,     The positions have been taken, hov/ever, and 1,200 Bulgarians captured, a large number when the mountainous country is taken into consideration.I did not attempt to discuss at French Army Headquarters any details of the French offensive,  such as its general direction, points at which the chief opposition is expected to be met with, and the line which the offensive may be expected to reach.      General Grosseti had taken over command only about a week before and his General Staff Officers were also new.     Consequently they could have formed no opinions of any value on the above points.I discussed this question privately with General Jaequermot, however, who was Sarrail&apos;s Chief of Staff from the beginning of the Salonica.operations until after the capture of Monastir, and now commands the division holding
3- liiHMonastir. Jacquermot is highly thought of at our Headquarters, and there is probably no one whose opinion is of greater value.He stated that in his opinion the French Army might reach Veles, but that it would be quite impossible to reach any really decisive point or even to threaten the railway to Constantinople.     General Milne is of opinion that if the French reach Veles the three armies may hope to reach the line VELES -STRUMICA - PETRIC.If this result is attained, no further general military success will be possible until months have been spent in the construction of roads and railways, &amp;c., &amp;c., that is until the Spring of 1918.1 of There is now a feeling of confidence at the British andFrench Head-Quarters that a severe blow will soon be dealt to the enemy and that in the present low state of moral of the Bulgarians,  this blow will produce a situation favourable to negotiations.     At the Serbian Headquarters the subject of negotiations was not broached,  but the Sub-Chief of the Staff considered that Bulgarian opposition might break up altogether in the face of a second blow following on the defeats of last summer.This subject is dealt with in detail in the attachedpaper.ate There is no date mentioned for the offensive, but thealon-Front.British troops will shortly begin to suffer in the StrumaValley, several fresh cases of malaria having already occurred, and in the low-lying plains, after the end of May,  the heat handicaps European troops.     But owing to the different altitudes and climates of the various sections of the Salonika front,  it will be a matter of some difficulty to synchronise attacks on the different fronts.     The Albanian Mountains remain snow-covered long after the heat and mosquitos have already commenced in the Vardar and Struma Valleys.
The following are various points which General Milne wished brought to notice at the War Office. I am informing the departments concerned, without delay.esssity of ng divi-uo to tth.yraent men and f non-ing age,Though all that is possible is being done to prevent or reduce fever next Summer,  therex is little hope of more than moderate success.       Formerly infection was restricted to certain areas, but now, owing to movements of troops and civilians,  Salonica itself and all the surrounding country is infected. Consequently great wastage from sickness must be     ^ anticipated next Summer.C-in-C. especially urges that the 6 divisions at Salonica be kept up to strength. -   The force is small, and if reduced much below its present strength will be of little use for offensive purposes.     , In order to keep the force up to&quot;strength, considerably more men than the 10% reinforcements at present in Salonica will probably be required.It is considered that perhaps women could be sent out to replace men of fighting age who are engaged as orderlies in hospitals, while older men might replace younger men employed as transport drivers, &amp;c. Some such measure as the above would release a con-siderable number of men who could be trained locally in their fighting duties.31-3-17.E.A. PLUNKETT. Lieut.-Col.,G.S.
