Report No. 10:- for week ending; 29th March, 1917,,The Jrime Mini ster 0The following report covers the work of the National Service Department (except Recruiting of Volunteers, which is the subject of a special report) for the week ending 29th March 1917, SECRETARIAT,(a) Statistical Department.,The number of men enrolled as National Service Volunteers during the week was 34,279, the total number enrolled to- date being 200,537.It may be noted that it took 21 days to enrol the first hundred thousand and 22 days for the second hundred thousand.(b) Passports Department.The total number of applications for passports examined up to date is 4,701 of which 299 cases were considered during the week, of these latter it was decided to recommend the issue of passports in 243 cases, and to refuse the issue in 56 cases,(c) Registry.The total number of letters received during the w-:..ik amounted to 16,046, of which 12,445 were for th; Honfs Section and 3,601 for th-.; ;.&apos;omwn&apos;s Section.

of Subsistence allowances and extra travelling expenses for volunteers, is completed.     Up to the present the number of claims by Volunteers in respect of these allowances is very small. THE LABOUR ADVISER.In the course of his duties the Labour Adviser attended a meeting at Bradford of the West Riding Woollen and Worsted Committee on Man Power and Production.    He formed the opinion that the Committee could be constituted as an Advisory Committee to the National Service Department as regards Production and Substitution and to the War Office as regards Contracts:    and that the experience gained by the Committee in its work during the last six months should be made available for any other Tradft Committee for similar, work that may be called Into existence.     He also attended and addressed a meeting at Leicester, under the Mayorfs Chairman-ship, at which Mr. Joynson Hicks 11,?, also spoke in place of ivir.- Walter Long who was unable to be present.      While ai Leicester he visited the offices of two of the large Trade Unions and found that it would be impossible to securo their co-operation with the Employment Exchanges,The same conclusion was reached at a meeting of the Labour Advisory Committee, working .?ith the Department, held on the 27th March.THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, has been mainly occupied during the -week assisting in the organisation of meetings in Liverpool, Manchester and other places.     The meetings in Liverpool and Manchester, both addressed by the Director-General, were very successful.     The Lord Mayor of Manchester stated that the meeting there was tho largert afternoon meeting he had seen in that place.
The Director of Intelligence reports tha  in Lancashire the main difficulty is a deeply rooted objection to working with the Employment Exchanges*Press Intelligence.     The Press Intelligence Department has been very busy extracting from all newspapers criticisms of the Department and replying wherever possible to these,     A symposium from well-known men and women was issued to the Press and was received V/ell in most places.     &quot;The Times&quot; issued a criticism of this symposium, which was replied to by Mr. Higginbottom.The Director-General&apos;s letter on National Service Week sent to all London and Provincial morning papers on March 23rd has resulted in a better understanding of the scheme.A special article in &quot;The Dally Mail&quot; by Mr. Twells Brex has assisted the Department.     The Director of Enrolment arranged for this article by calling upon Lord Northcliffe and subsequently intervi e,;ing Mr,. Twells Brex.Such papers as &quot;Tit-Bits&quot;, &quot;Answers&quot;, etc,, have done good work and the Department is indebted to them for their articles.An arrangementvhas been made with National Press Agency, at a nominal fee, to circulate weekly to Provincial papers a stereotyped column of news and articles. AGRICULTURAL SECTION, (a) Demand for Labour on the Farms.The situation now is that practically the whole demand for agriculture is met by our present arrangements up till the 30th of April.In Scotland there were on the farms at the beginning of the week 1,486 ploughmen lent by the Army.     At the Clearing D-ipot there wwre 89 men .:siting orders, and there were still at
their units and engaged in their ordinary military work 1,000 additional men whom the Military Authorities were holding at the disposal of this Department.     It is anticipated that these sill be all absorbed, but there is no expectation that any more will be required.In England the reports which are afforded to the Section by the.Agricultural Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners go to sh07 that every farmer who wishes a ploughman has the means of obtaining one from similar sources, (b) Shepherds.The other form of skilled labour which is in demand at the present timeis that of shepherds for the lambing season. The Section has b^en in communication with the Military Author-ities for some time upon this matter, and an instruction has been issued to the various Commands to release on agricultural furlough all skilled shepherds who are not required by Military exigencies to remain at their posts.     In addition to. this General Order a large number of Individual cases have been considered by Major-General Eegartwho has given his authority for their release for this special.-work. flans for the Period &quot;^-Beginning the 1st Hay.The period for which this Section has now to prepare is that which will begin when all Military help has been with-drawn at 30th April..    As whs indicated in the last  ,rewk.-s Report, arrangements are being made to secure the assistance offered by Corporations and Local Authorities willing to lend for a month or six weeks people in their employment with agri-cultural experience, shall be made available at thw beginning Qf -:ay.     It Is hopod in this way to. obtain a considerable body of skilled assistance r-t tho tinks wh-.;n it is most required.
-5-The other workers whose old is expected^T-allz-in-to-^the -categories dealt with in the following paragraphs.(c) Agr1cultural Companies*These are the Companies of soldiers unfit for General Service which are being established throughout the country at the present time.     It is hoped that, although almost entirely unskilled, they v.rill be able very materially to assistagricult-ural operations by working alongside experienced hands who &apos;will be able to show them what requires to be done.It is proposed during the present month - in which these men will not be required on the fields - to use them on the country roads and for the purpose of felling timber,(d) NatIonal Service Vo1unteers,Many of these have been somewhat impatient that having volunteered for agriculture, their services have not immediately been utilised.     It would, ho-/ever, have served no purpose to have sent them on to the land at the present time, A consid rable proportion of them are unskilled,  and some are not robust enough to be of service in all kinds .of agricultural work, but the remainder are expected to become a very useful supplement to the labour at present on the land, (e ) fart-Time Labour-^cl^ilL-^.?rZ!i3     A Meeting was held on Tuesday at v/hich th^re wire present representatives from the great Public Schools, the Secondary Schools, the Elementary Schools, the National Union of Teachers, various Cadet Corps, various Church Brigades, and Boy Scouts.     The purpose of this Meeting was to arrange a scheme for the employment of boys throughout the agricultural season.     The general lines of such a scheme were discussed and the main features agreed upons
A Committee was appointed to go into the details of tho necessary arrangements.     Enough was diaoussed to make it clear that a large amount of very useful hoy labour will be available from the beginning of May till the end of September, although the gr:-;at bulk of it will, of course, not be actively engaged until the month of August.A start is being made in the second week of April with an experiment which will chow the value of the work that can be done by schoolboys with no previous experience.     It has been arranged that a party of 50 boys from Rugby, under Major Belcher, will be engaged during the Easter Holidays on a farm in the West.of England.     A careful report will be made to this Section and thw results will form a good guide to theassistance which may be expected in the later parts of the-season.     It was disclosed in the course of discussion on the general question of boy labour, that a very large number of boys are at present engaged in running errands in connection with various retail businesses who could readily bo utilised if the necessity arosi;,     Many of those are members of various organisations - such as the. Church Lads Brigades and the Cadet Corps.     The only difficulty lies in the question of pay, because these lads are at present receiving wages which most farmers would be unwilling to give for boy labour.     The question of the utilisation of this group of boys has, accordingly, been left over for further consideration. ^ Sehool Teachers and Civil Servants,School Touchors and Civil Servants also are being organised for the purpose of providing labour during the holiday season, and u considerable reinforcement is expected from them.
The&apos; distribution of these various -groups will of course involve considerable organisation, especially- in regard to the provision of accommodation and rations.     It is hoped that considerable help will be obtained from the Ordnance Department of the War Office, and that a large part of this supply of labour may be accommodated in tent...     This matter, however, is still to be arranged with the War Office, (g) Relations ,vith English Board, of Agriculture.A meeting took place in the course of the week between the Director-General and Mr, Turner on the one hand, and Mr. Prothero, Sir Arthur Lee and Mr. Strutt on the othercAs a result of this conference several matters of difficulty were cleared up, and it is now promised that the Agricultural Committee, representing the English Board of Agriculture in the Provinces, will afford to the National Service Department the information necessary to enable it to supply the farmers 1 needs.     It was also arranged, that no separate appeals for labour should be made from the Board of Agriculture, and that in all cases where its Officers thought some appeal desirable, intimation should, be mede to the National Service Department and the appeal issued by the Director-General.     This will avoid a certain confusion which at present is created-in the public mind. SUBSTITUTION.The reports from the Commissioners of this Department throughout England make it clear that thero is a definite aversion on th; part of the farming community to the acceptance of National Service; Volunteers because of a fear that the employment of a Volunteer   /ill result in an exempted skilled man on the farm being taken away by the- Military Authorities,.
Tiris view is so persistent and so deep-sea tod tlTit it will probably be impossible in England to induce farmers to use tho labour available unless -tboy receive a guarantee that National Service Volunteers are not to bo regarded as substitutes j or until the Military Authorities have first of o.ll taken away the exempted men - thus leaving the f armors in a position in which they would bo compelled to accept such help as they could got.It will be essential to clear up this situation in the course of the present month, otherwise a part of tho Hational Service Scheme will bo abortive, GENERAL TRADES SECTION.(a) Roorganisa.tion of the Section,,(1)&apos; Tho work of this Soction is Doing reorganised by tho now Director with u view to linking up tho various branches of tho National Service Department dealing with matters affecting all industries and employments except Agriculture, Thus, the Labour Advisory and Council and tho branches dealing with Substitution, Foreigners and the Statistics of onrollod volunteers have all been associated, with tho Trades Soction,(2)   The Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners have boon brought under one control - a Chief Commissioner - so as to avoid confusion and delay.     This Commissioner will bo responsible to tho Director of the Section,(3)    In connection with tho administration of tho Restricted Occupations Order the; voluntary services of a Barrister have been secured.     This Ordwr Is being administered in such a way as to avoid unemployment and unnecessary hard-ship either to the employer or the- -worlanan,(b) The New Policy.Tho problem of finding from tho less essential wr-ados a sufficient number of substitutes for the purpose of
roleasing for the Army men of military age and fitness from munitions and other essential work has been re-considered, and a new policy has been decided on to supplement the general appeal for National Service Volunteers.&apos;    In essence the new plan is a direct bargain with each tro.de of the less essential type, to produce a certain number of substitutes for a definite purpose.     The selection of the men will be left to a joint committee of representatives of employers and workpeople, and the same committee with the assistance of the officials of this Department, will see to the allocation of the substitutes to the jobs rendered vacant by the calling up of men for the Army. In this way the whole business is left to the trade itself. This is.-   an absolutely essential point, as both sides, and especially the workpeople, will not havo anything to do with Employment Exchanges,     This new plan has already been put before the Building and Printing Trades.      In both cases it has been heartily welcomed as the only way to get to work so as to produce satisfactory results.     The trades, both employers and workpeople,went to help their country.     There is no doubt whatever about thats     But they want to do it in their own way and through their existing organisations.     In these cir-cumstances it is necessaryj if the scheme is to be successful, to work it independently of the Employment Exchanges.(c) List of Tradesi and Occupations of Primary Importance.Correspondence was continued in connection with this of an explanatory character and as regards suggestions for its revision,(d) Restrieted Occupations Order.The correspondence; resulting from this continues to be very heavy, many hundreds of letters having been sent out during the week in connection with it.     The work also has
involvod tho general administration of the order, e,g* the deciding and classifying of interpretations, etc,(e) Conferences with Trad._Representatives.A number of conferences have been .attended by repre-sentatives of the Trades Section and a number of deputations received.     Especially may be mentioned those with the Printing Trad.. 3 Unions, the Building Trad, s and the Institution of Electrical Engineers,(f) Coneentration of Trades SectionsThe collection&apos;and summarizing of returns from Tramway and Omnibus Companies, the Stock Exchanges,,  the Brewing Trad^, etcc, has been continued, (&apos;g )   Commisgpemora.Copies of the Codified Instructions to Divisional Officers and Employment Exchange Managers have been issued to all Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners, together with detailed instructions as to their bearing upon the work of the Commiss-ionerso      These wore followed by further instructions as to procedure in connection with claims for subsistence o.nd travelling allowanceSteps have been taken to set up the necessary panels., from which representatives of Employers and Operatives can be selected to sit with the Sub-Commissioners to hear appeals by Employers or Volunteers against the withdrawal of Volunteers from their present occupations.      Tho Commissioners have been asked to submit suitable names, and they have been instructed, when making their selection, to avail themselves of the services of Associations of Employers and Employees throughout their districts, as well as panels of Courts of Referees or Munitions Tribunals,      In the meanwhile the Sub-Commissioners have been instructed to deal ut one- with those cases where their
-11-229decision is in favour of the Appellant.      In certain..cases&apos; it-has been found possible, when the Sub-Commissioner goes to make his preliminary enquiries, to settle cases by agreement, and a considerable number of cases are being determined in this way.and Sub-Commissioners regarding travelling, office, and. other incidental expenses *have been appointed in the Yorkshire and East Midlands District::-and five in the North Western District. WOMENS&apos; SECTION.(a) Flying Corps.    Conferences have been held with the War Office and with Miss McArthur, Mr. Button and Miss Sloan as to the terms and conditions of service for Women in the Flying Corps.

NATIONAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT.Secret,Part of Report No. 10:-   for week ending- 29th. March 1913THE PRIME MINISTER Recruiting of National Service Volunteers,The following report covers the work of the Enrolment Section during the week ending 29th March 1917,a) Campaign. The campaign has been carried on very actively throughout the country.     In some districts, owing to the slowness of the County Councils to move, Committees have only just been formed and it will be necessary to allow the campaign to continue for some little time,,As a result of National Service Week the enrolments have been a record for each day and up to. mid-day Thursday -March 29th - the total enrolments are over 200,000,     fhese enrolments are exclusive of Foreigners (friends or enemies),. Women, Clergy and Doctors.Correspondence throughout the week has been extremely heavy.     Owing to the re-organisation of the Department it has been possible to keep up-to-date with the correspondence and to answer all letters promptly..b) Offers of Service Department,       5,500 Enrolment forms sent ...................* 11   11........................ - &apos;with special letters -were dealt with in this Department, together with a very large number of other letters dealing with various questions.     This Department has been re-organlsed and is now up-to-date,. )    Foreign Section.   During the week 317 foreigners were enrolled, and this Section has now enrolled 593 altogether.     These are exclusive of enemy aliens, who are being dealt with by Scotland Yard.
Ministers of Relip-iom   .  The numbers of offers of service received from Free Church Ministers now total 216.     A large number of these offers, however, do not appear to be for whole-time work..     Offers received from Church of England Clergy for whole-time1 service amount to 597/ and for part-time service 457.     The services of these special National Service Volunteers are being organised by their own Authorities, .. Meetings.      The number of Meetings arranged in England and Wales is 1,755 and in Scotland approximately 200.     In addition to these Meetings, it is estimated by the Department that roughly 1,000 additional Meetings have been held in Works and other places, which would bring the total number of Meetings held to approximately 3,000.The general reports are that in the overwhelming majority.of cases these Meetings have been a complete success. Local Authorities and Literature.  , The demand for literature and leaflets has continued to be enormous throughout the week and a very large supply has been forwarded.The number of enrolment forms sent out for canvassing purposes has been very large.     Efforts are. being made to clear up all surplus stock throughout the country so that nothing shall be wasted at the end of the campaign. Publicity.     The cost of advertisements during the week amounted to approximately  4,500, some  775. of this being in connection with the Women&apos;s Section.The advertisements obtained, in cinemas throughout the country have been very valuable.The cost of printing pamphlets, etc., during the week amounts to approximately  2,000.
Notional Service Sunday.       The reports received from all local   Committees show that churches of all denominations had special sermons on National Service Sunday, most of which were based on the pamphlets sent out by this Department for the information of Ministers.     This organisation has proved entirely successful.(Signed) NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN
