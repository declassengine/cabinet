f   aflb      t if T       1D/HS/239I, GERMAN113R? OF BIiOGKADE OTORHaf ION. March 25 - 29, 1917,BLOCKADE.The following is a summary of the casualties of merchant tonnage due to enemy action, which were officially reported in the period March 23 - 29:-Steamers.(500 tons gross &amp; over)British Neutral* * * *98,531 gross tons 43,459     &quot;      &quot;Sailing Vessels.(100 tons gross &amp; over)British NeutralTotal618 3,823itItf!146,431 gross tons.In addition to the ahove were reported, on March 23, the following casualties caused by the German raider &quot;Moewe.-&quot;9 British Steamers   ......1 British Sailing Vessel .47,653 tons gross. 215     &quot;       &quot;47,868 tons gross.The German Government have announced a blockade of the Arctic Ocean (outside Norwegian waters) east of Long. 240 E and south of Lat. 750 N.     After April 5. neutral ships will he attacked in this area without warn-ing.     It is remarkable that Berlin has asked the Swedish Government to transmit this announcement to the Russian Government.The German Admiralty threaten to detail 50 sub-marines for the purpose of sinking produce-boats on the voyage from Denmark to England.     But during the past week these boats have been regularly arriving in the United Kingdom.
The Swedish Government have been asked &quot;by the United States whether armed merchantmen may enter Swedish ports, and have promised to consider the point which, in their view, is one that every neutral power is free to decide in the manner most oonveniEnt to itself.     She Swedish War Insurance Committee have reduced the premium on timber-cargoes for the United Kingdom from 30$ to 15$.     It is a slight concession, but possibly a sign of a better disposition towards Allied trade.Shipments of munitions from Norway have been fairly regular, though important consignments of iron ore, pit-props, and calcium nitrate are still waiting for tonnage.   It is not easy to find Norwegian crews for iron-ore ships which sink as soon as they are tor pedoed.     The employment of armed British vessels for this particular trade seems desirable.   Indeed we shalfL probably use such vessels for the whole of our trade with Norway, if we are able to requisition a good number of Norwegian ships for other trades.   There is an impression in Norway that the route from Bergen to Lerwick is insufficiently patrolled.     It might be disastrous if this impression became general among Norwegian owners.Sir Walter Townley hopes that we shall not go to extremes with the Dutch Government on the question of armed merchantmen.   If Mr. Van Aalst succeeds in his plan of starting a new Dutch service to the United Kingdom there will be no need to send armed British
ships to Holland.     Sir w. Townley now thinks that if the Dutch Government yielded our point, the Germans would probably overrun Holland. If, on the other hand, the Dutch Government received an ulti-matum from us and rejected it, we could only put pressure upon them at the cost of sacrificing the Agricultural and Pish Agreements, and immobilising a large number of Dutch ships.(The German Government offer immunity to Dutch vessels proceeding from the United Kingdom to Holland, on condition that these vessels will hence-forth abstain from trading with Allied countries.The United States War Risk Bureau propose t4 insure all cargo, (except arms, ammunition and guns) which is proceeding to British, French and Italian ports from the United States, at a flat rate of 3$, providing that it is carried in American vessels.2?he stocks at the Atlantic bunker depots show no improvement, because neutral ships cannot be induced to carry coal for them.   Probably we shall be obliged to allocate British tonnage for this purpose;     but we are asking the United States if they can send American coal in armed American ships to these depots.     It is proposed to replenish the South American depots with coal carried from the United States in neutral vessels. The Controller of Dutch shipping offers to find some tonnage for this service, if it can be insured in the British market at 3$ for the round voyage.
We have hopes that the United States may co-op era te with us in a system of bunker-control which will compel neutral shipowners to use their tonnage in the most advantageous manner.We are refusing all facilities for vessels sailing from the United States to neutral countries other than the country of register.   We hope by this means to withdraw from neutral trades a number of Norwegian vessels.   If they return to Norway, we shall be able to requisition them;   and we shall also prevent other neutrals from using Norwegian ships in place of their own.The details of our scheme for requisitioning Norwegian ships are still under discussion, Germany has made a counter-proposal, to charter half a million tons of Norwegian tonnage at 35 kroner per ton dead weight. As Germany has no overseas coaling stations, the offer will not appeal to the owners of ocean-going vessels.As the Danish shipowners agree to the requisi-tioning of a large number of their vessels for use in Allied trades, we are granting facilities for the resumption of sailings between Denmark and the United States.The Board of Trade have instituted a White List for Greek shipping.     No insurance for the hulls or cargoes of other Greek ships may be provided by the British market.     This step has produced an excellent effect on those Greek owners who had not yet come toterms with us.
The Marquis de Cortina is visting this country to discuss our proposals for making Spanish tonnage more useful to the Allies.   Provisionally we are yielding to the pressure which the Spanish Government are able to exercise owing to our need of Spanish iron-ore;  we are permitting neutral ships which go to Spain for iron-ore to take out coal cargoes, and to bring back a small proportion of Spanish oranges.BRITISH BLOC  APE *      Only three cargoes called for the serious attention of the Contraband Committee in the week ending March 27.     The cumulative effect of our Agree-ments with neutral trading assoeiations and shipping lines, of the navicert system and of the bunker policy, is to make it more and more difficult for suspect goods to be shipped at all.The postal Censors have discovered what appears to be a gross breach of diplomatic privilege on the part of the Chilean Legation, which has been acting as an intermediary for the transmission of funds from the Banco Aleman Transatlantico in Chile to its head-office in Berlin.     As the Banco Aleman and its customers subscribe heavily to German War Loans there appears to be ground for stronger action than a formal protest to the Chilean Government in London.SQANDIHAYIA. The Swedish political situation is still obscurethough it may improve with the retirement of M. Hammarskjold.     Were it not imperative to secure facili; ties Sox the transit traffic to Russia, we could easily coerce the Swedes   by holding up all cargoes of
- . ^ -V 118cereals and American coal destined to Sweden, But, until Archangel opens, these measures must, it seems, he held in reserve.Batocki, the German Food Controller, is said to have paid a secret visit to Copenhagen to negotiate an exchange of German coal for Danish produce.     The result of his mission is not known.     It appears that the coal-supplies already promised to Denmark will he despatched partly by railway and partly via Rotterdam.The Germans propose to make extensive use of Rotterdam as an entrepot for their coal trade with Sweden.     About 40 German vessels will shortly reach Rotterdam in ballast from Bremen and Hamburg.   They will carry coal to Sweden and will return with iron and copper ores for Germany.3WITZBRLAM). It is reported that the Germans are bringingconsiderable pressure to bear on the Federal Council to induce them to release the Cotton which is stored for German account in Switzerland.UNITED STATES.        The American Government propose to wind up all firms in the United States which operate in the inter-ests of the enemy.     The;/ are also obtaining legisla-tion to prohibit dealings in enemy owned securities and the transfer of German balances from American banks to enemy or neutral countries.    They have invited Ameri-can banks not to take up loans against German owned securities.   Mr. Page has been instructed to obtain information from our Foreign Office as to methods of controlling trade under war conditions.
7   -UNITED KINGDOM SUPPLIES.      The decree of the Argentine governmentprohibiting the export of Wheat and Flour as from March 28 has come at a most unfortunate time.   The Wheat Commission has 310,000 tons of wheat lying in the Argentine, and we have ships on the way out to load 190,000 tons.   The Argentine Government talk of requisitioning the whole of our stock for the home market.     Further, it is possiblB that they will prohibit the export of Maize, of which the Wheat Corn-mission holds 150,000 tons.     The Ministers of the Allies are pessing for leave to load our ships when they arrive, with wheat, or with part wheat and part maize.     Even if this request is granted, we shall lose the benefit of more than half our purchases, unless we find ways end means of putting pressure on the Argentine Government,    This is a matter in which the United States could help us.     The Argentine can hardly dispense with British and American coal-supplied nor can neutral vessels make the voyage to   Buenos Aires if we and the United States refuse facilities.It remains to be seen whether the new Russian Government will carry out the grain-contract which their predecessors made with the Western Allies, There will be a great temptation to divert cereals from Archangel to Petrograd and the more distressed of the European provinces.      But if Russia will not give us cereals, she can not expect to receive munitions from us.       We are forwarding six million jute bags for the packing of these cereals.   A large part of these bags must be transited through Sweden if they are to arrive in time, and we are negotiating for transit facilities.     The rest have gone or will go by
water.      5?he new German blockade of the Arctic Ocean will increase the difficulty of transporting the grain;   but it is reasonable to suppose that the blockade has not taken our Admiralty by surprise,H. W. C. D.War Trade Intelligence Department. 30th March 1917.
