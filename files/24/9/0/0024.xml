Sir,In continuation of my letter of the 16th instant, I am directed by the Shipping Controller to report, for the information of the War Cabinet, as follows:-(l)   With regard to merchant shipbuilding I am to report that the strikes on the Tyne and at Barrow have delayed engineering work.     The construction of hulls has proc e oclocl satisfactorily so far as the amount of materials available has allowed.    There is still an insufficient supply of materials to keep the facilities fully occupied.    The total amount of wages, paid during the last two weeks was  447.000, of which  138,000 was paid on merchant work.    22 Munition certificates were issued, making the total number of standard, ships certified 80, and the total number ordered 114.(2)   With regard to the purchase of merchant tonnage building abroad, contracts have been signed for 146 ships of about 749,000 tons, costing about  31,000,000 and in addition contracts have been closed for 32 ships of 267,000 tons, costing  10,000,000.    Negotiations are also proceeding for further tonnage.     Included in the 146 ships in respect of which contracts have boon signed, is tonnage amounting to 65,600 tons, value  2,340,000, which has been ordered in theDominion ,secretary, ^ar Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W.
(Signed)     GRAEME TH01S0H.Dominion of Canada through the Imperial Munitions Board;   also tonnage of 68,600 tons, costing  2,787,000 building in Japan and China and 6 oil tankers of about 43,5.00, costing  1,750,000 purchased by this Department on behalf. of the Admiralty.(3)   The requisitioning of Liners is still being extended, and owing to the hearty co-operation of the ship owners no difficulty is being experienced in making the necessary arrangements.(4)   A-Meeting of the Tonnage Priority Committee was held since the date of my last report to consider the statement prepared by the Statistical Branch of the Ministry from the demands for tonnage submitted by the various Departments,    As these demands greatly exceeded the carrying power of the tonnage available it was decided that they should be revised by the Departments concerned and that the Committee should meet again as soon as the revised demands had been considered by the Ministry.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,
