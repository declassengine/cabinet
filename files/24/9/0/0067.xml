NOTES OH QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD ARISE IE BULGARIA WERE WILLING TO CONCLUDE A SEPARATE PEACE *(Forwarded to the Prime Minister by hr. Noel Buxton, 1 .P., on behalf of &quot;a group of students of Balkan affairs&quot;).1 *   Military Questione.Should we attempt to secure the active aid of Bu^ria against the Central Powers.,  or should, we be satisfied with very benevolent neutrality?The chief motive which will drive Bulgaria to a separate peace will be war-weariness-, and &quot;difficulty of inducing her peasants to go on fighting any longer. -Their objection is probably not to fighting on the German side, but to fighting at all.    If this is so,  they will object as strongly to fighting on our side, more strongly perhaps, for &quot;our side&quot; is for them the side of the hated Serbians and Roumanians.     Clearly then,  a separate peace will have no attraction for them, unless it means the immediate cessation of fighting.    If we ask for active aid;  the negotiations are likely to fail.The test cf Bulgarian sincerity will be their readiness to allow us the full use of their territory for cur operations, and especially of their railways.    They must instantly yield the military possession of Uskub, Nish and other vital points.-Should they be required to intern all Germans in Bulgaria? if possible, this is desirable, but it might endanger the safety of their armies in Rumania11 *    The Dynastic Question.Ought we to require the abdication of King Ferdinand? The result of this would be the accession of Prince Boris who has had a Russian and Orthodox education., and      is tee young and inexperienced to play a strong game of his own.&apos;If, on the other hand, we leave Bring Ferdinand on the throne, not only can the change of front be effected without a coup d*etat, but&apos;we -gain this clever though un-scrupulous man a3 a support for our policy.    It will be 3aid that he is too treacherous even for temporary use. But a prince who has betrayed every possible patron in turn, is hountifc at the end to attach himself to those who have saved him.In any case to get rid cf the King would not give us security.   He would hover round;Boris as Milan did round Alexander, and intrigue more actively if he. were irresponsible, than he will if left to do the work cf &quot;consolidating Bulgaria.
Ill     Terr it ori al Ques t ipns.There is no chance of inducing Eulgaria to desert the Central Powers., save &quot;by assuring to her the satisfaction of the substance of her justifiable territorial claims.   The Central Empires would probably give her more.   These claims are, of course: -(a) Macedonia. - at least the &quot;Uncontested Zone&quot; as defined in the Treaty of 1913.    This is really a minimum, for much of the contested zone, even Usknb itself, was then (and may be still) more Bulgar than Serb.(b) The Dobrudja frontier ay it existed in 1912 - again a moderate claim, for the population north of the old frontier was more Bulgar and Turk than Rumanian. .(c) The question of sea-rortg would best be solved by.giving to Bulgaria both in Stionica and Kavalla the right to use them as free ports, with harbour and warehouse space and running powers on the railways.     A concession would be necessary to build a railway from Sofia to Kavalla, using the existing Seres-Drama section.     It is not enough to give Kavalla to Bulgaria,&apos; noris that necessary.     If Bulgaria gets Monastir, she must have the use of Saldnica.     The solution by free ports is better than annexation, because it makes a beginning in Balkan co-operation.1V*   Future dispositions.;  -      &quot;&quot;The only security against German hegemony In the Balkans and against the struggle to attain one or the other, lies.in a Balkan Federation.     Bulgaria1s assent to its creation should be one of the terms of the   settlement.     It should be a Customs Union and a Defensive Alliance.    Provision should be made for mediation or arbitration between the partners, but the arbitrator should not be Russian alone;,   otherwise the fiasco of 1913 may be repeated.Further, steps should be taken to end the dependence of Sofia ;on German finance- V&quot;.    Guarantees, .The -guarantees of good faith should be:-(i)     On Bulgaria&apos;s&apos;part the -surrender to&apos; our use of the railways.(if)&apos;&apos;  On our part the recognition of the provisional Bulgarian administration in Macedonia und the&apos; Dobrudja.ojOth March 1917.
