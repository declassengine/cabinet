(Ho, 2),The records of the Department at this date show thefollowing details of the operations in 588 Boroughs or UrbanDistricts:-81,862 applications for plots have been made, and.63,772 plots have been provided, containing a total area of about 4,450 acres0Reports from many districts indicate that applicants are reluctant to take plots for the period limited by the Order, and that large areas of permanent allotment,s have been provided which are not included in the above-mentioned acreage8 Under the stimulus of that Order, war-plots are being provided by private enterprise.     In the County Borough of Nottingham, for instance, nearly 4,000 such plots have been arranged,     These figures also are not, included In the totals given above,Local Authorities are cultivating lands in their own possession and arc making arrangements fairly generally f-^r plots to be cultivated by women and children, either on their own responsibility or by way of assistance to other cultivators.In two instances where landowners have exercised, arbitrarily their powers to eject allotment-holders who have cultivated the allotments for many years, the Board navo entered on the lands with a yievv to keeping the tenants in possession at any rate for the period of the warcHer ticuj toral Section. 466 replies ha?e been received to the Circular sent to4c
Auxiliary Hospitals,     In the case of 145 extra land will he cultivated by staff and patients.     Advisers have been sent to 27 of these to give instruction   in cropping, etc     The remaining hospitals had no further land available.II, .&apos;. \i       TECHNICAL AND ADVISORY. There are no special developments in the technical work of this Division to report.     With regard to publicity, an organisation ia being set up to secure the regular insertion in the weekly papers which circulate in agricultural districts of articles and paragraphs dealing with all the aspects of food production, which may from time to time be of use and interest to the farming community..   &apos;:/-:-.r.&quot;-   .Illi &apos; * j .   LABOUR DIVISION&apos;. Soldier Labour - Reports from most parts of the country indicate that the soldiers made available for agriculture are being well taken up by farmers, although in some parts the bad weather has had an adverse effect.   All ploughmen and National Defence Force men still at the depots were ordered by the Military Authorities to return to their Units on Saturday night, but information has been received to-day that they are now back at the depots, so that they will again be available for farmers.     Returns received from Agricultural Executive Committees show:  that 21,398 men have been applied for.   In addition, Commanding Officers have released a number of men in response to individual applications.With so many skilled men available, the demand for men of the Agricultural Companies has naturally been small, but at least 3,000 are now at work on the farms.     These are included in the total figure given above.     The large majority of the men in the Agricultural Companies have apparently had no experience of agriculture.   It has, therefore, been sug-gested to the War Office that some of them might be used as guards for the able-bodied Civilian Prisoners of War placed at
the Departments disposal, many of whom are skilled in agriculture; and also that others might be used to replace skilled farm workers in the Royal Defence Corps.National Service Scheme - War Agricultural Committees have been informed of the duties which this Department wishes them to undertake in connection with the demands for agricultural labour to be supplied by the National Service Department. Boy Labour - A representative of the Department has attended two conferences during the week dealing with the question of .the employ-ment of school beys for agricultural work during their holidays, or partly during school term.     One of these was held by the Beard of Education and the other by the National Service Department. Russians - A further number of Russian soldiers have been placed in lest Kent and a batch- of about 35 have commenced work at Rochford, in  Essex.Prisoners of War - Very satisfactory reports have been received as to tho work which is being done by the combatant prisoners if arar at Lewes, Huntingdon, Evesham, Feltham, and Toddington; in fact in most cases additional prisoners have been asked for. The Employment of Prisoners of War Committee have made an allotment to this Department of 5CO   non-combatant prisoners interned in the Islo of Man, who have volunteered for work.     These men will be allocated if, and as soon as, prevision can be made for guarding them.Agriculture and Recruit ing - The arrangement between, the Beard and the &quot;&apos;&amp;r Office with regard to the exemption of men engaged whole-time in &quot;tf-lk production expires on 1st April.     Although only fit men for general service will be called up to the Colours, yet the large aniount of correspondence which is being received would appear to shew that farmers will find the greatest difficulty in maintaining cultivation and milk production when the General Service men have e^n taken for the Army.bfi
Judging., f rom the letters received it wculd appear ^fatful-&quot; whether, in the case of the men who have been refused xeiription by the Tribunals, the Recruiting Officers have consulted ne   Agricultural Representatives before calling the men up.W(2menjj3 Branch. Additional offers of houses for training centres, and ffarmers and landowners willing to give training have been eceived during this week, which, bring the total number of possible raining vacancies up to 1,465.     These offers have not by any leans all been accepted, as at present the number cf training acancies is far greater than the number cf wrmen to be trained,,The   Country Organisation is now sufficiently advanced to ecure that, in the large majority cf counties, women volunteering or farm work are selected in each locality, are given short course f instruction either in Training Centres or by individual farmers, nd are put into touch with employers.   Further, that due oversight s given to the accommodation and general conditions offered to^ he women.     Arrangements are also being made for the supply of roup Leaders and the fuller use of part-time village workers.The demand for women labour is slightly increasing, he supply of volunteers is, however, negligible, and this on ccount cf the fact that the cards issued by the National Service apartment have only just reached the Pest Offices and Employment  changes, and that little or nothing has been done to bring heme &apos;J people the terms offered by the Government.A plan is being prepared by this Department, in c-;n--dtation with the Department for National Service, for recruit-n8 meetings and propaganda work to be arranged throughout the %itry.
MACHINERY SECTION. Motor Tractors.     No more of the 615 tractors ordered from America have become available during the week, &quot;but a further 20 have been purchased by the Department in this country.     27 mere Caterpillar tractors have fceen secured, making a total of 60 of these trautors now available.     A further 12 privately-owned tractors have been placed under the control of the Department during the week.     The total number of Government owned and controlled tractors and ploughs, therefore, amounts to 63S.29 additional motor engineers have *een appointed this week, bringing the total number of appointments up to 332.     Messrs. Clayton and Shuttleworth,   and Messrs. Rust on and Proctor, manu-facturers of the Caterpillar tractors, have kindly consented t* allow their staffs to undertake the training of military and civilian drivers in the operation of the machine placed temporarily at the disposal of the Department by the Russian Government. Steam Taokle .      The return of a further 33 specially classified men has been applied for during the we&amp;k,      *;*  men have been ordered to be returned to civil employment; bringing the total, with the 6d mentioned in 1 ast week&apos;s Report, tip to 147.IV. SUPPLIES. Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Section.Sulphate of Ammonia.     The demand for sulphate of ammonia its relatively large and the unsold stocks in makers&apos; hands are now very small.     Every effort is &quot;being made to meet this, demand, and a return has been obtained from makers showing the present stocks and sales for immediate delivery in order to prevent any sulphate which is not required at once being kept in store.     In cases where stocks are available, instructions are given for the sulphate to tee delivered to the order of the Advisory Committee.A Conference was held during the week with the Sulphate of Ammonia Advisory Committee, when the proposals as to-8-
the Government Grant were accepted, and the matter Is to be put at snce before the makers &apos; at a meeting of the trade.     The question of the future arrangements for regulating distribution have also been discussed with a view to securing more, control       this Department. The method of dealing in the summer with surplus quantities of sulphate of ammonia, whether by storage cr otherwise, is being dis-cussed with the Ministry of Munitions.Superphosphate.     The purchase of about 3*000 tons of superphosphate now at Tunis has been arranged, and a ship chartered to load at once.The Ministry of Munitions have released sufficient acid to treat the phosphate rock now in makers 1 ;hands so that the output during the next month or two should be largely increased.The question of regulating the prices of superphosphate and compound manures for next season is being considered in con-junction with the Ministry of Munitions .Prices of Maize.     Progress has been made with the scheme f nr advertising the price of maize at ports and indicating the additional charges incurred in transport to inland centres, end it is proposed to send out a press notice on the subjeot and a statement as to port prices this week.     The Department has suggested to Mr. BigLrod, the Controller of Oil-seeds, that a similar system should be adopt ed as regards the prices of oil-cekes.Molasses.     A portion of the supply of molasses hitherto used for feeding stock is required by the Ministry of Munitions for the manu-facture of alcohol.     Enquiry is being made with a view to ascertain-ing the present deirand and settling whether any diversion of agri-cultural molasses is practicable.Lime, The supplies of lime available for agricultural purposes are being investigated, aid enquiries made with a view to the extension of local facilities for grinding limestone.-9-
Binder Twine. Returns are &quot;being obtained, from makers and importers with a view to determining the sufficiency of local supplies.Seeds Section,Seed Rot at oes . By arrangements made through the Irish Department purchases in Ireland are now being made, and aJbout 4,000 tons will Tie available by the end of the present week. Purchasing in Scot-land has almost ceased. This is due partly te the great scarcity of potatoes, and partly because the seed is &quot;being purchased Tjy other buyers at prices higher than those fixed by the Pood Controller, whereas this Department can only offer the authorised prices.The delivery of potatoes has &quot;been delayed by the cold weather.     Aliout 3,500 tons of the potatoes purchased in Scotland have been dispatched.     The f-drst consignment of Irish potatoes con-sis ting of.200 tons arrived at Bristol on Friday morning.     The whole cargo was discharged and loaded into railway wagons during the same dry, and many consignmaits are now in the hands of growers.The position with regard to the supply of seed potatoes may be summarised as follows:     The orders received by the Depart-ment amounted in all to 11,245 tons.     Arrangements have &quot;been made for meeting those orders by purchasing 6,500 tons in Scotland, 500 tons in England, and, (in addition to the 200 already delivered) 5,000 tens in Ireland.     It will thus be seen that the orders placed will, Lf executed in time, more than cover the Departments t ot al c ommitment s., I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland S, Prothero, M.P.,President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
