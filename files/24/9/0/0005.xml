E C RE T,G.T. 305.COPY.WAR CABINET.From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 26th March, 1917. (Repeated to Cox as No. 389 S.)(Received at India Office,  10 p.m.)Secret.   Your telegram of the 17th March.    Civil Administration of Baghdad.   Although paramount direct British administration may not be contemplated it seems essential that apart from martial law which can merely maintain order steps should be taken to over-haul and replace defunct Turkish administration and to carry on work of civil Departments.   For this purpose we understand suitable Arab personnel is not immediately available, and that onus must fall for the time being at any rate on British Officers. The immediate requirements appear to be (l) to secure sub-mission by political means of tribes between Kut-el-Amara and our front line and later between Kut-el--Amara and Nasiriyah and settle them on accustomed lands on revenue paying basis.   Latter is of course mostly in Basra Vilayet,  but we mention it to show full requirements;  (2) to overhaul and replace civil Departments of Vilayet of Baghdad.For (l) a few military Assistant Political Officers will be required and we propose to send such suitable Officer as are available from India.    We have already sent Major Bailey of Political Department, may we use our discretion up to,&apos;say eight more Officers?   For (2) an experienced Revenue Officer with a staff of two or three Officers acquainted with Arabic and if possible Turkish are required.    If Dobbs is willing to return to Mesopotamia and his health admits we propose to send him.    If not we propose Holme of Political Department.    One or two Officers from Egypt or London would be useful in this capacity.Further we propose to send Holland on completion of Trade Report to Basra as Cox&apos;s deputy, Wilson moving up (to Baghdad in similar capacity.
