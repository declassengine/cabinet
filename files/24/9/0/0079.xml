i0ijl This rDftcument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.INDIAN BULLETIN No. 4.EXPLANATORY NOTES.1. New Formations.-The Government of India undertook to have four battalions ready for embarkation for Mesopotamia by the end of March : of these, three are reported to have actually embarked. Of the four new battalions to take their place, one is complete and three within 100 men of completion. The whole 13 newly-raised battalions are now within 1,425 men of completion.The Government of India have been asked what fighting man-power they can produce and train to be fit to put into the field in the early spring of 1918 (in addition to the number to which they are already committed.) so as to relieve British troops now serving in India, Mesopotamia and Egypt; and whether as many as 100,000 men could be raised.The Government of India have also been asked to report whether arrangements could be made to secure large numbers of lumber men and wood-cutters for service in Europe.Under the Defence of India Force Act which now has come into operation Europeans are subject to compulsory military service, while Indians may voluntarily enrol in special Indian (native) units. The great majority of persons, whether Europeans or Indians, who are enrolled will be employed on purely local services. For general service in any part of India special units will be formed by selection from the enrolled men in each locality. The mention of Volunteers in Section 1 is understood to mean that pending the organization of the force under the new Act the services of men already enrolled and trained under the Indian Volunteer Act are being made use of.Telegram from Viceroy, to the Secretary of State for half monthending 31st March 1917.4597.

4. Internal Condition-Fall of Baghdad has caused no undue excite-ment. News was at first disbelieved by Pan-Islamists, and it is reported5, from some quarters that they are much depressed by it. Defence of India Force Act has come in for a good deal of criticism on the ground of differentiation between Europeans and Indians, but the various Home Rule League Agencies, which have been in other respects less prominent, have been busying themselves registering recruits. It remains to be seen whether they will actually volunteer when the regulations are published. The gift of one hundred million pounds to the British Government has been well received, only criticism being that Legislative Council should have been consulted beforehand.   The War Loan is making good progress.
