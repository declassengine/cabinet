THE EFFECT OF THE REVOLUTION ON THE SITUATION IN THE BALTIC.

So far as we are aware the effects of the Revolution have been more evident in the Navy - as embodied by the Baltic Fleet - than in the Army, though it appears that the general feeling in both tends to a desire to continue the war. Generally speaking, the Army appears to be settling down to its normal duties under the new regime, and recent reports from Petrograd state that the new war Minister, M. Cutchkoff, has just been enthusiastically received at the front. On the other hand, frequent desertions and insubordination are reported from the Riga front, which appears to be that suffering most from disaffection. On the night of the 27th March the Council of Workmen and Soldiers after a lengthy discussion passed a resolution calling upon the German proletariat to dethrone William II as they themselves had dethroned Nicholas II. This being done negotiations could be opened to bring the war to a close, but if there was no similar response from the German proletariat, the Russian proletariat resolved to defend Russia to the last drop of blood.

With the Baltic Fleet, however, things seem to be still anything but satisfactory, and the situation is obscure. It appears that in the first days of the Revolution, some 200 officers, including several of high rank, were murdered and another 300 imprisoned, and officers remaining at Kronstadt have been subjected to degradation of all kinds. The new C. in C., Rear Admiral Maximoff, is apparently under the thumb of a Committee of Sailors; there is a general lack of discipline, and officers remaining with the fleet appear to have little, or no authority over the men. It is difficult    

    
difficult to imagine the state of chaos which must exist in the fleet, now deprived of several of its original responsible chiefs, and of the services of at least 500 officers out of no very great total. Fortunately, in so far as the war itself is concerned, the effect temporarily can have no special significance, but it is of urgent importance that law and order should be again established in the Baltic Fleet without delay, or the results, once the Baltic is clear of ice, may very well be disastrous not only to Russia, but to our cause in general.

It is suggested that the Germans know very well the present state of affairs. They are too wise to attack at the present time, knowing full well that in this popular war, the consequences would probably result in the Russians showing a combined and firm front against an immediate attack, with the inevitable forgetfulness of their differences in the common danger. On the other hand, in two months&apos; time, dissension may have done its work in the Russian ranks, and a German attack then might be expected to succeed beyond expectation especially as by that time the Gulf of Finland and Riga would be ice free, and the Russian Fleet might have become a mere negligible quantity through want of preparation.

It is to be hoped that an offensive on the Western front may act as a suitable check to this move.

Last year the presence of the carefully watched minefields in the Gulf of Finland, Moon Sound, and Irben Strait (Gulf of Riga), and the energy of the late C. in C. Baltic Fleet (Admiral Kanin) probably saved the fall of Riga. On April 4th, our N.A. reported that sweeping had been carried out by the Russians at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland, and Russian icebreakers were sent to Moon Sound to attempt the passage into the Gulf   


Gulf of Riga. This was successfull only on the 8th April, when a flotilla passed through the channel, out in the ice into the comparatively free water of the Gulf of Riga, and succeeded in adding a new minefield to that already established before the winter in Irben Strait. Irben Strait had been reported as ice free on 22nd March, but it was not until the 6th May that the Gulf of Riga was wholly navigable, the ice clinging to the eastern shore and Moon Sund, the latter not being open to navigation until the 10th May.

In July 1916, Admiral Phillimore stated that the Russians had added up to that date no less than 10,000 new mines to their minefields since the ice broke up, and were continuing to lay them in various parts, though it was found that the effect of the ice had not destroyed a very large number of these originally laid. Irben Strait Minefield was reinforced by another 1,000 mines.

This was the result of energetic and enterprising action on the part of the authorities under arduous conditions as the work was started immediately on the break-up of the ice. It is to this action, therefore, probably as much as anything else that the German offensive against Riga was not pursued last spring, and it is evident that the turning of the Russian right flank this year can only be prevented by some equivalent enterprise on the part of the Navy.

RIGA.

It therefore appears to be urgent to warn the Russians of the great danger that may arise from lack of cohesion in the fleet, and it is to be observed that a retreat from Riga would not only considerably extend the line to the northward, but would entail the less of the fortified islands separating the Gulf of Riga from the Gulf of Finland, and would in all probability actually secure the central of the Gulf of Finland to the enemy. FINLAND.

Desultory action on the part of the Russian Baltic Fleet during the next few weeks may enable the German threat of a landing in Finland to be carried out. The effect would be momentous to Russia, and it is doubtful whether it could be checked before the neighbourhood of Petrograd was reached. The attitude of the Finns themselves towards the invader is doubtful. Before the new regime they were undoubtedly anti-Russian, but their dislike was based on "Autonomy for Finland" which has now been promised by the Provisional Government, though there may be a feeling that this promise is an empty one. In any case the Finns have for several years undergone no military training, though it is reported that a few had earlier in the war migrated to Germany to go through the officers&apos; training establishments. It is possible that the only Russian force which could immediately be called upon to operate in this direction is the garrison of Petrograd, but these troops have already been promised dispensation by the Provisional Government from service at the front, as a reward for the part they played in the revolution, and the countermanding of this order would probably not be taken in good part. So long as the Russian minefields remain intact, however, there is little danger of an invasion of Finland, but all depends on the immediate action of the Baltic Fleet.

SWEDEN.

Last year there was considerable fear of Sweden participating against Russia, especially in the event of the Germans effecting a landing in Finland. This danger however would now appear to be improbable as the food question in Sweden is said to be acute. Sir E. Howard reports on good authority that there will be a bread famine in Sweden in May, so she is hardly likely to be persuaded by Germany to now enter the war, as we hold the trump card in rationing her.

GERMANY.

In conclusion it must be supposed that: (1) the situation in Russia, at any rate in regard to the Baltic Fleet, is obscure. (2) It is of urgent importance that the Russian Naval Authorities should thoroughly realise the danger of present inaction. The fall of Riga and a landing in Finland are both possible, and even probable, without the immediate cooperation of all arms of the Navy. (3) It is a difficult, but by no means impossible, task for the Germans to break through the minefield closing the Gulf of Finland, in which case the Russian Fleet in their present state of disorganisation would be at the enemy&apos;s mercy, and it is not improbable that a number of capital ships would surrender and be used against us. (4) A period of great anxiety must be passed through in the course of the next few weeks when the ice breaks in the Southern part of the Gulf of Finland, as an easterly wind might have the effect of driving the ice out into the Baltic, thereby partly destroying the minefield, while the Baltic Fleet remains imprisoned, and unless ready to mine afresh in the course of a few days, the result may be disastrous. (5) The cooperation of the Army and Navy is paramount in the defence of Riga, and steps must be taken without delay to ensure the protection of the right flank of the Russian Army.
