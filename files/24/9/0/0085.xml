TIGHT SUBDIVISION 01&apos; STAlDAEa SHIPSIn January 1917, tho YAn: Cafcinot authorisod tho construction of liorchant ships by the Controller of Shipping subject to tho Admiralty being in complete agreement, the question to bo brought bach to the War Cabinet in the ovbnt of any difference of opinion botwoon the tup Departments.Tho question has now arisen whether Standard Ships should bo sub-divided by watertight bulkheads to a greater extent than is tho commercial practice, with a view to giving thorn additional security against uiidcr-wator damage.     The Admiralty is strongly in favour of suoh further sub-division.     Tho Controller of Shipping, however, does not think that the evidence so far avail-able&quot; is sufficient to justify tho provision of tho additional bulkheads.The Board of Admiralty desire&apos;strongly to urge that the additional bulkheads should bo fitted.Bom of the principal grounds upon which the Admiralty recommendation is based aro(1) It is not claimed that immunity&quot;from sinking oaii be secured by additional bulkheads, but actual war experience has proved that whenever a ship has been saved softer sustaining serious undor-water damage,. it has been duo to the existence of water-tight bulk-heads, and that vessels which sink quickly after damage are those which have few bulkheads.(2) Even if watertight bulkheads fail to prevent a&apos; vessol from sinking, it is certain that they will pro-long the time taken to sink, with tho results that -(a) The chances of life-saving and of beaching the vessol aro increased.(b) The gun defence can bo used for a longer poriod and with greater confidence:(e) The expenditure of ohomy torpedoes, both absolutely and in proportion to tlio use of gunfire, is Increased, and the underwater destructive power of the submarine is correspondingly curtailed.(d) If the sinking period is prolonged the suc-marines Kill be compelled to operate further from the coast in order to maintain a given rato of destruction, and this in turn would involve either a greater immunity from attack for a given amount of tonnage, or a larger number of submarines to deal with the increased area.(3) Every ship kept afloat is a gain of so much steel and other material, besides labour, of which, there Is so great a deficiency.     It is. bettor therefore to preserve existing ships than to build new onoseA copy of the official correspondence is attached for refercneo.-(I) Admiralty letter of 3rd February, (ii) Controller of Shipping^ letter&quot; of 6th February (ill) Admiralty letter of  8th February, liv) Controller of Shipping^ letter of 15th Faroli, Admiralty, - &quot; *

Government, and desire me to acquaint you. that, having carefully consider ed these plans,  they have come to&quot;the following eon-clusions:-(a) That it is very desirable that the speed of these standard vessels should be at least 11 knots,  to enable them to operate on   more or less equal terras against the submerged attacks, now delivered bv submarines, whose submerged speed for a limited period may well approach 11 knots.-(b) That it is also most desirable that additional subdivision should be provided.   The Admiralty have prepared a design of Cargo Vessel with extra W.T. bulkheads,  and two prints are enclosed showing these extra WhT. bulkheads in red.    Their Lordships are advised that the addi-tiohal time in working in these bulkheads would be inappreciable in the speed of construction, and it is considered that the precaution of fitting these W.T. bulkheads is essential to give the new standard vessels a measure of protection against submarines and a fair chance of reaching port after attack.If you so desire,  their Lordships would be pleased to arrange a conference between their technical advisers and your representatives.I am,  etc.,(Sgd) .

I am commanded by. my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to invite your attention to the accompanying&apos; returns of&quot;vessels captured, tit&quot; destroyed by the enemy (copies if which have already been supplied: to the Board cf Trade).&apos;2-. .        From th$$l returns&apos; it will&apos; be&apos; observed that there has been an. increase in&apos;, the use by the enemy of torpedoes and I mines, and that 250 miles 1.3 the outside limit, from land at ! which- these attacks, are made.   Theoe: features af the attack&apos;&apos; fr-pm the ground   for-the recommendation&apos; a,s to subdivision which has - been made&quot; by -&apos; the Admiral ty,.3.

GRAHAM GREENE(4) COPY OF LETTER, DATED; 15th MARCH. 1917, FROM SHIPPING CONTROLLER TO TIPS ADMIRALTY.Sir,With reference to your Letter of the 28th February (C.B. 104641/17/X 782&quot;) respecting the plans of Standard Ships,&apos; I am directed by the Shipping Controller to state, for -the information of the Lords Commissioners of the&apos; Admiralty , that your communication has been carefully considered in connection, with the proposal put forward by the Admiralty to provide more watertight bulkheads in the Standard Ships than are customary in ordinary merchant vessels.;&apos;2. . The Controller desires me to say that he doesnot.think the evidence so.far available is sufficient to justify the provision of additional bulkheads in the Stand-ard Ships,.   Such additional subdivision mu.3t ku^Vitably cause serious curtailment in the general utility of the vessels, and.without considerably more freeboard than is commonly provided for merchant -ships,- there is no guarantee - judging by experience already gained -that the additional bulkheads would,prove effective in ensuring, immunity from sinking,  in view of the extensive damage done by the modern torpedo or mine,    These are- also,the views.of the Shipping.
