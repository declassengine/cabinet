COPY. 57SECRETWAR   CABINET.G.T. 312WAR OPPICB,28th March 1917To:General Sir William R. Robertson, G.C.B.,K.C.V.a,D.S.O. Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Prom:Lt.-General C.N. Dessino, K.C.M.G.In accordance with information received from Russian G.H.Q,., I beg to inform you that the situation in Russia at the present time is as follows:-Up to now the Russian Armies have not been affected by the events which have taken place in Russia.    Minor dis-turbances took place at Dvinsk and in some garrisons on the lines of communication where, owing to agitation, some excesses were committed.Owing to a certain amount of disorganisation at the depots, and for other reasons, in the opinion of the Minister for War, the Army will not be able to receive any drafts either of men or horses for the next three or four months.     Owing to the above, decisions reached at Petrograd and Chintilly Conferences must undergo modifications.The extreme left parties are agitating against the War, but the Government, the greater part of the labour and soldier deputies, the educated classes, the Army and the population of the Provinces are in favour of and are working for a continuation of the war to a victorious end.Life in Petrograd and in the Provinces is noticeably getting quieter, but it is impossible to say, as yet, that, while the different parties are still wrangling, normal conditions will soon be established.I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(Signed)    C. DESSINO.Lt.- General.
