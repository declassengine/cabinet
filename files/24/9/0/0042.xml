SECRET.G.T, 341 WAR CA3IKET.Notes on Part I of CORN PRODUCTION BILLPlan in the Bill-1, Not a minimum &quot;price&quot; as promised by thePrime Minister.2. Offers special advantages to the best corngrowing district.3* Does not offer the same inducement to farmerson second class grass lands to plough.     It, there-fore, misses the sedond of the chi^f aims (the first being food production) viz. helping to plant a good agricultural population on the land.4. Administratively unworkables    Would requirearmies of officials, clerical and inspectorial; and would lead to uncontrollable confusion.Alternative plan for consideration -A minimum price for what is sold.A market to be provided where farmer can get minimumprice.     Use for this purpose the stores of exist-ing corn dealers, whose premises and business would be controlled.The minimum price in the Bill being for first quality, prices of other qualities to be regulated according to present custom of the trade.Oats, if resold to farmer, to be converted.This plan -1. Provides the promised minimum price to all whoclaim it.2* Is fairer to the cultivator of second class land3? Beet fits in with the custom of the trade.4, Makes best and mo3t economical use of existingmachinery of trade.Is administratively simple and controllable as well as the least expensive.(Signed)       J. R. Campbell,Irish Office.2nd April, 1917.
