SECRET G.T.3S2WAR CABINET,THE PRICE OF BARLEY &amp; OATS   -.(Memorandum by the Food Controller)In continuation-of my note (Paper No. G.T-545)on the price of home-grown wheat,.I wish to direct the attention of the Cabinet to the position of barley and oats.     Both these cereals are now in greater demand for food, as both are allowed under the Milling Order to be used.for bread-making.   Barley, owing to the ease with which it can be dealt with in the ordinary flour mills, ia in special demand by millers for this purpose..    The effect of the Voluntary Ration, and the economy of bread which is induced thereby, has thrown a greater demand upon oatmeal, and extravagant prices have been reported to the Ministry as having been paid, in Scotland particularly, for oats and oatmeal.The following statement shows the course of the weekly averages of barley and oats since the beginning of the cereal year, the weeks quoted being at the end of each month.Barley.

Ministry of Food.4th April 1917.The Gazette prices represent, in the case of barley, a quarter of 400 lbs, and in the case of oats, a quarter of 512 lbs.   The usual weight at which British barley is sold in the markets is 448 lbs per quarter, and in the case of oats 556 lbs per Quarter. Neither barley nor oats are under direct control by the Govera-rnent, and therefore differ in this respect from imported wheat which is controlled by the Wheat Commission.The latest quotations current for imported barley and oats are as follows:-Barley, Indian quarter (400 lbs.)  .&quot;        American       70/-   M &quot;       (400 lbs)Oats, Ho, 2:. WhiteClipped American   66/-   &quot; &quot;       (320 lbs)Western Canadian      67/6   &quot; &quot;       (320 lbs)If it is considered necessary to continue the importation of barley and oats, the control of imports should be taken over by the Government,The price which I have suggested for home-grown wheat is 80/- per quarter of 504 lbs.   I suggest that the maximum price for home-grown barley might be 72/- per quarter of 448 lbs. and for home-grown oata 5l/- per quarter of 556 lbs, &quot;The con-tinued rise in the prices of these cereals is now affecting the cost of bread, and I consider that it is necessary to arrest . this rise so as to enable me to regulate effectively the price of the loaf which has already reached the highest level to which it should be allowed to go.(Sgd)   DEVOHPORT.Food Controller.
