March (121 Trans-port 669) from the Secretary of the War Office,  is circulated herewith for information.From the above it appears evident that nothing can be done for the mement.   It is for decision, however, whether the matter should be carried further with the object of taking advantage ef any opportunity that may occur in the future,  to develop this route, eig. -(a) If at a later stage in the War, the continuance of of the Salonica operations should no longer be necessary and rolling stock thereby be freedor - -(b) If, at a later stage in the War, we should, in con-junction with the U.S.A. be in a position to supply the rolling stock Required.The possibility that our submarine losses may eventually renderUnavoidable some such course as that described under (b)should not be lost sight of.(Initialled)   M.P.A.H.

The narrow gauge railway from Bilbao to San Sebastian jnneots with the San Sebastian-Hendaye electric tramway, which aa tho same gauge.2,    An alternative plan would be to open the Canfranc tunnels id to metal the as yet unmetalled portion of the way, and so connect Ji Jaoa and Pau,     Shortage of labour would however probably be a ar to this operation.3r     The main difficulty seems to.be the shortage of rolling took in France.     On the Eastern Franco-Spanish frontier there are ,000 3panioh trucks waiting with merchandise which the French can nly take on at the rate of thirty a day.Before approaching the Spanish Government it would be ecesaary to have some guarantee that if the stuff was sent to the rontier there.would be adequate arrangements for forwarding it on &apos;/er the French system.
