PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF OUTPUT OF MATERIALS IN RUSSIA,n T r c Petrograd.:.?.-*- March 9/22nd, 1917 .In view of the serious delays which are taking place in the delivery of the British Artillery to the Russian Army, I consider that immediate steps should be taken to establish a more efficient arrangement than at present exists for the order,supply,and delivery of the Raw Materials and machinery etc,in addition to Munitions,which are being supplied fromEngland to Russia.The resources of Russia in ray/ materials are enormous,and her capacity for the manufacture of war-materials is capable of.great developments,provided that outside help is given for the supply of those items most urgently required.&apos; The difficulty which arises in this-help being granted to the best advantage by England,is the total absence of any Authority here in Petrograd to whom the Russian Manufacturers etc can refer,and to&apos; whom-the Ministry of Munitions can apply for reliable information as to the relative urgency and necessity of the various orders sent to England.The present Russian Committee in London is not In a position to give - such information.
The solution of the present difficulty is, in my opinion,the formation of a Committee here in Petrograd.   The Members of this Committee \?ould be drawn, from the leading Russian and British business men, all of whom are fully conversant with the Russian situation and have been in business in this country     (j for many years.    This Committee would be directly under me, so as to&quot; ensure that the military requirements predominate above all else.The chief duties of this Committee will be.as follows:-1,,     Investigation of means for increasing the output of Munitions and other war material from the Russian Factories.2.     Ditto for the output of steel, iron, coal and other raw materials in Russia..3.     Ditto for the efficiency cf the existing railways.Under this latter heading I would refer to Mr. Bury&apos;s report on Russian Transportation.     This covers the whole ground but I feel that results from his recommendations can only be ob-tained if the matter is constantly rubbed in to the responsible Authorities out here.    It is obvious that much can be done even with the present equipment and organisation if only the Russians will wake up..4.     Ditto for the check on all Goods received at the various t ii ports to ensure that they are delivered and promptly made use of.   &apos; Many eases have .come to my knowledge of machinery being despatch- \ ed from England and then allowed to lie about in this country doing nothing,..5.      Provision cf information direct to the Ministry of Munitions as to the; relative importance of the various orders sent to England.I fully appreciate that the above is a very comprehensive programme, but nothing can be worse than the present conditions; and. if only a little is done it will all be in the right direction;I feel sure that the Russian business men, as a whole,;will welcome the formation of this Committee here in PetrOgrad       iand the New Government will be much easier to deal with andbe more efficient than the olsfe one.
The following Statistics show the serious state of the.production of Raw Materials in Russia at the present time.Coal, ,Iron and Steel.The tot&apos;l output of coal from the Russian Mines is onlyvery slightly increasing.    I am told that the output estimatedfor this year may possibly be even less than that of 1916, ifmeasures are not immediately taken to expedite Transportationand the Labour Shortage...The total coal output from Russian TTines has been ...1915    ......   .27,100,000 tons1916 ......     29,200,000 tons.1917 ......     Estimated at approx. the same as for1916.The estimated maximum possible output for 1917 has been given as 41,:600,.000 tons,, but the leading Engineers out here assure me that this cannot be obtained under present conditions. This is confirmed by the figures just published for January, 1917, which show an output only a very little greater than for January 1916.;,,  The total consumption of coal used by the Railways has been ,..1915 ......    8,020,000 tons1916 .......    9,750,000 tons, increase of 21 per centapprox.The consumption for the month of January 1917 shows a similar Increase, over that for January 1916,  ?.o that the totalconsumption of coal on the Railways 1917 may be taken atnot less than 12,000,0u0.. tons.With this increasing consumption o2 Coal on the Rail-ways, it is clear that a corresponding Increase in coal out-
I a.i. told that Locomotives are the most pressing. . The shortage and irre ular supply of wagons is largely due to bad management.   Mr. Bury deals with this question in his Report.put from the Mines i&apos;  of vital importance if the consump-tion at the    etallurgique and Munition rrorks is to be main-tainedeven at their present rate.     In reality many works could use much more coal If they could only get it and there -by increase their output..An excellent example of the shortage in coal can befound in the Iron and Steel Industry in Southern Russia.In this district there are nrprox. 64 Blast Furnaces.In December 1916 ..... 44 of these were working11       !&apos; were dMirped down9       &quot;       &apos; were standing idle.In January 1917 ...... 41       ;r        were working.12       &quot;       &apos; were damped down 11      &quot;        were standing idle.The shortage&apos;of Coking Coal is chiefly responsiblefor this deplorable state of affairs, which is growing worse.Russia produces large quantities of Coking Coal but themajority of it has to be transported to the Furnaces on theRailways.    These latter are unable to deal with the requiredtraffic c . &apos;&apos;y,:$:^y^0Mlr^i:By-\^.-The chief causes of the Coal Shortage are:-1.     Shortage of   Locomotives and &apos;*agons.
The suggested Committee in Petrograd can probably do some good to remedy Nos,&apos;1 and 2 above by constantly representing the gravity of the situation to the responsible Authorities, and by putting forward to the Government recommendations obtained from the Colliery Managers on the spot etc.The Committee can certainly regulate the supply of such materials etc., as are exported from England to ensure that-they are sent to those Mines which require them the most urgently,y.ire Ropes are most urgently required by the Collieries and I attach a special statement on this subject,   See Appendix I at end of this report.The above statistics refer to the Southern Russia district and the following statistics show that the same conditions occur in the URAL mining district.2..&quot;.     Shortage of skilled labour in the Mines.Many companies have tabulated the names of their skilled men employed prior to the war and submitted the liets to the Russian War Office.   The latter is apparently unable to trace the majority of the men and they are probably killed or prisoners, as the skilled men were taken in huge numbers into the Army at the outbreak of war.   The r.rar Office are now undertaking .to release men from the front but those who have gone back are absolutely unskilled and it apparently takes a long time to train the Russian labourer.,^* * *     Lack of labour-saving machinery.-such as coal cutters etc,4.,.     Shortage of Equipment for new llines and extensions toexisting ones, and of materials, tools and repair apparatus.
Total Output for 8 months,.1915, 1916.Pig Iron,........ -   590,000 tone 535,000 tonsStructural Iron.,,. 2,100 tons 2,350 tonsWire...,,.,,....... 16,300 tons 29,100 tonsRails.............. 69.300 tons 31,500 tonsExcept for Wire, the important products are on the decline, The total output of Iron and steel productions in this district is slightly less in 1916 than it was in 1915 . In&apos; a number of , cases Works have been unable to keep up a steady production due entirely to want of fuel and raw materials which could not be obtained for lack of transport. Copper,The output in Copper shows a serious decrease1910,.,.,,,., 23,000 tons total output1911,,.,.,,.. 26,000            &quot;1912....,..., 34,4001913......... 34,1001914......... 32,0001915......... 26,0001916......... 22,000            i!This serious decline in output is due to the shortage ofTransport and Labour, as in the case of the coal business.The Russian Copper Mines are at 3 Centres :-Ural Group supplies 52 per cent of the total outputCaucasian      Group      il        26 per cent &quot;Siberian   Group       &quot;        17 per cent &quot;Production from scrap metal,..... 5 per cent &quot;Fuel for the URAL and CAUCASIAN GROUPS has to be transportedover about 1500 miles of Railway and the supply has-beenabsolutely inadequate.In considering the Copper situation it must be remembered that the occupation of the Batoum Works of the Caucasus Copper Co. by the Turks at the end of 1914 caused the production of this Company to entirely cease until about December, 1916,ttIT !! tf
I think the above, illustrates in a brief manner the condition of the production of Raw Materials out here at the present time.I now propose to give examples of cases where it would seem that the importance and urgency of the situations have been misrepresented to the Authorities in England when permission has been granted -for the execution of orders for Russia. . -I..... Hishni Novgorod Explosive Works.A large plant is on order for this new Works and I have heard that some of the machinery is nearlng completion^ I am assured that the Works will not be ready to produce Explosives before 1919,2......Tamboff Powder Works.Some plant was ordered early in 1915 under Glass A on short delivery and was delivered at the end of that year.-This plant has been erected but has not up to the present done a day&apos;s work.      It is &apos;.stated that there is no fuel available,5... .,Varonesch Detonator Works;This Works&apos;at present takes a supply of Electricity for power purpobbs from the local Town Supply Station. This.-latter has a capacity of only about 1500/2000 H.P. Orders have, I.hear, been placed for 15000 H.P.  of plant for large&apos; extensions at this Works.       These extennions will not be-productive for about 2 years.- 4. government 2nd Steel Wo.rks?, Kamenskaya.This is a new Worker   About 15,000 H.P. of plant is on order and a further 20,000/30,000 H.P, is to be ordered very shortly.   Part of the- original 15OO0 H.P.  is on A class for delivery but I understand that only part of the complete machinery required before the Works become productive is on order under this A class. I am told that there is no chance of these.Works being ready to start production until well on in 1919.5....... Simbirsk Cartridge -Works on the Volga.Part of the new plant for this Works is on orderunder Class A; and Part, equally, important,, has not yetbeen allocated under a classification of any sort., 6tt.,.,. .I\ew ^RussiaCo,.-I understand that there is a large machine of about 750C . H..P,  on order -under class A for urgent delivery for the above Co.     It is stated that the buildings were not started in November 1916 and buildings take a long time to erect in this Country.
The above cases show the one side of the picture, the other side is the pressing need of new plant for Works and Factories ?/hich are ready to take the plant into immediate use on war material work. For instance at the putiloff Government Munition Works an increase in Generating Plant is urgently required.     Again at the Shouvalcff Co,-, who are making shells, a Rotary Converter of about 1500 H.P. was ordered about Ma&apos;y&apos;4916.;    sanction for the order was not given until February 1917 and then it was put under Class A.There are a number of other cases similar to the above and I believe that the Committee,  I have suggested,  could do useful work by transferring plant and other apparatus to the places where it is most needed.It appears to me that all our energies should be devoted to helping those works which are actually producing or will be doing so this year or during the early part *f 1918,  in preference to the large; nev/ Works which cannot be ready before 1919. The importance of the orders for these large new Works has been misrepresented,,  I feel sure, at any rate as far as the present war is concerned-.
I now would refer to the present proceedure for accepting. Orders from Russia for execution in England, and the modif-ications in the same which I would suggest,The following is., I understand, the present proceedure in the case of an order for machinery.,,1,.,, Customer carries out and settles details of the mach-inery required with the representative of one of the British Firms out here.     When these negotiations are settled the British Firm is presumably notified by its Representative and applies for grant to manufact-ure from the Ministry, of Munitions.2,..   Meanwhile the Customer advises the Petrograd GovtDspt concerned and requests them to obtain sanction for the execution of the order in England.3....,   The Govt Dept here then refers the matter to theRussian Govt Committee in London and at the same time informs the Chancellery of Credit that payment is to. be granted in Pounds Sterling.4,..   The Russian Govt Committee in London does nothing in the matter until the talon authorizing the credit is received.   When that is received the order is refor-red to the Commission Internationale de Ravitallle-ment in London. &quot;&quot; .5.,,   The C.I.R.. then-refer the order to the Ministry of Munitions.I suggest that the Committee in Petrograd could send the order&apos;direct to, the Ministry cf Munitions direct and com-pletely cut out the various intermediate steps above mentioned.Conclusion. ,- I beg to. suggest in view of the gravity of the . Situation out here; and the large, amount of work to be done that authority should be granted-to me to immediately form the Committee on the following lines1,.,   The Committee will be selected from leading business men out&apos;here, Russians and British being&apos; equally re-presented,     I consider that six men are sufficient on the Main Committee, and I should arrange for such other men to be enrolled for special work as may be found necessary.
2-..-. All orders for materials for Russia from the British Isles must he sent through my office, at which the Committee will sit under my supervision.- -3... All communications from me will he sent direct to&apos; theMinistry of Munitions and no communications will he made through the Russian-Government Committee in London,The Russian Government must he officially informed that all matters relating to purchases etc. from England must be referred to the Committee here and not to theRussian Government Committee in London.I do not consider that there is any necessity for any addition&apos;-al staff.to be sent out from England as there are suitable and sufficient men here on the spot.As regards the orders now being executed for Russia, Iimagine the Ministry of Munitions could send me a completelist of those under Class A.&quot; These are the only ones, Ipresume, on whioh delivery this year can be expected.With this list I can, at any rate, ensure that the Works andFactories concerned are making preparations to receive andthen make use of the apparatus whatever it may be.I claim that the proposals put forward in the above, outline,in any case,^ a practical working scheme, and I am satisfiedthat, if they are approved, the results will be beneficialto the Allied Cause.In considering this question I have borne in mind the necessity for obtaining immediate results by patching up working-concerns in preference to helping the more grandiose schemes, which will only benefit Russian Industries in the distant future.&apos;In
In view of the extreme urgency of the case, 1 trust that this whole matter may be carefully considered and that the decision arrived at may be communicated to me7 without delay by telegram.P.C. POOLE.     Brig. General. Commanding.Mil: Eq: Sec: in Russia,Pctrograd,March 9/22nd 1917,
..... Appendix No, I .....WIRE ROPES for COAL MINES,y mm. wn m* mm       ^ ****** .w *w *a* iw w -* -A large quantity of the Wire Ropes used at the Russian Mines were obtained from Sosnovitzy in Poland&apos;,   As this place Is now in German hands, there is a serious shortage of ropes atthe MinescThe consumption of these ropes in the Southern Russia district was about 2000 tons during 1916 and only about 1000 tons of new ropes were exported into the country* In October 1916 I understand that the Ministry of Munitions referred back to Russia applications for permit to manufacture wire ropes in England and although strong representation as to the urgency and&apos; necessity of the supply was made from this end, apparently no permits have.yet been granted.    The Council of the Mineowners Association of South Russia again sent an urgent telegram to the Russian Govt Committee on this subject on 20 Jan/ 2 Pebr. 1917.I hove made careful enquiries and consider that an effort should be made to supply 2000 tons of these ropes during say the next 6 months or so.   To meet the most pressing needs, shipments of 200 to 300 tons should be made per month.If it is Impossible to meet this demand, an alternative is to supply say half the total tonnage quoted above in the form of steel wire, which would be made up into ropes by the Russian works.    This would delay tho supply of the ropes to the Collieries but would be better than nothing,(Signed)   F. P00LE.&apos;Brig.-General.
