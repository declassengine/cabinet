^itis the Property of His aritannk Majesty ^Government.-]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   March 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.MEMORANDUM ON GUARANTEED PRICES FOR WHEATAND OATS.THE proposals embodied in the Bill endeavoxir to insure the farmer against the low prices, the fear of which constitutes his chief objection to a return to arable cultivation.The question that was raised at the meeting of the War Cabinet was whether the prices guaranteed by the Bill should apply to the quantities of wheat and oats produced or sold.To make the position clear, an example may be given. The guaranteed price for wheat of the 1917 harvest is fixed at 60s. per quarter. Let it be assumed that the &quot; Gazette&quot; price for the seven months, the 1st September, 1917, to the 31st March, 1918, is found to be 57s. Qd. per quarter. The grower is entitled to receive the difference, 2s. Qd. per quarter, for each quarter he has produced (or grown and sold). The grower is free to sell at his convenience and when he pleases, and no account is taken of the price he obtains. Some farmers will obtain more than the &quot; Gazette &quot; price, which is an average. Thus, one farmer may grow seed wheat for which he obtains the special price of 60s. In that case his returns will be 60s. per quarter plus the 2s. Qd. allowance, or 62s. Qd. in all. Another farmer may have harvested his wheat badly so that he can only obtain for it 52s. Qd. per quarter. His returns will be 52s. Qd. plus 2s. 6d., or 55s. in all per quarter. A third farmer may specu-late for a rise in price and hold his wheat in stack until May, when he may be able to sell it at 65s. per quarter, on which the allowance of 2s. Qd: will also be paid, making his return 67s. Qd. per quarter. As an offset to this extra price he will have lost weight, and will not earn the allowance on so many quarters as he would have had if he sold in the previous October.On the question of whether the allowance should be paid on the quantity of corn produced or on that grown and sold, the arguments may be summarised as follows (the question arises in practice mainly over oats, as most of the wheat is sold): 1. The object of the Bill is to encourage production of cereals. Therefore a small grower who does not usually sell his crop, or the farmer who normally thrashes his oats from day to day for his stock, may claim that as they have increased their production they are entitled to any advantages guarantees offer.2. If the quantities entitled to the allowance are determined on sales only, a large number of sales made solely for the purpose of obtaining the allowance would result. Many men would needlessly incur the expenses of preparation for market and sale.3. The necessity of selling in order to earn the allowance will force a quantity of poor corn on to the market, thus lowering the &quot; Gazette &quot; average and increasing the payment to be made by the State.4. The statement by the Prime Minister on which farmers have acted in arranging their cultivations was ambiguous on this point. It is capable of being construed as a guarantee of a minimum price
At first sight the balance of convenience to the State would appear to be on the side of the grown and &quot; sold &quot; basis. In either case sales would become the main evidence determining the quantity on which the producer was entitled to an allowance. The ultimate check would, however, be that of the grower&apos;s power of production, whether the allowance was paid on the quantity grown and sold or produced. As a grower can buy as well as sell, the only method of checking at the end of the season whether a grower has sold corn which had previously been sold by some other grower would be to examine whether on his acreage he could have produced the corn on which he claims an allowance: Thus production must become the ultimate test on which payments are to be made. In any year in which there was a large difference between the &quot; Gazette &quot; and the average price, the financial result to the State obtained by the two methods would be much the same.If the basis of production is adopted, a clause should be inserted in the Bill enabling the Board of Agriculture to schedule areas within which payments would be made on estimates of yield.ofor the individnars crop, and if it is defined by the Bill as a guarantee of price for the country&apos;s crop,&apos; and, further, for only such part of it as is sold, the farmers will have a strong case for claiming that the promise is not being fulfilled.5. The report of the Selborne Committee, that it is &quot; essential that payment should be based on the number of quarters actually harvested,&quot; raises a Parliamentary difficulty if the payments are proposed on only such part of the crop as is sold.Per contra, it may be argued-1. That the administrative difficulties presented by payment on production are greater. In many cases, particularly among the smaller growers in Ireland and Scotland, payment would have to be made on an estimated yield based on acreage. This estimate would involve some special arrangements, and then would be liable to errors tending to over-payments by the State, it could only with difficulty and imperfectly differentiate between good and bad farming.&apos; 2. On the sales basis, the volume of administration and the number of payments would be less. In years when the difference between the &quot; Gazette &quot; price and the guarantee was small, many farmers would forgo the allowance in order to be unhampered in dealing with their oats at their convenience.
