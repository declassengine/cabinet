NOTE BY C. I&quot;, CJ. Si OK HIS VISIT TO ITALIAN HEADQUARTERS 22nd to 24th Mar oh, 1917.1, In response to my suggestion to despatchFrench representatives, General Nivelle sent the Chief of Staff to General Foch and a Lieutenant^ Colonel from his own Headquarters to accompany me.     Apparently they had received instructions to say little or nothing, and at any rate they con-tributed practically nothing to tho discussions which took place.      General ITivelle had already sent a written communication to General Cadom&amp;j and beyond it nothing was said on the French side* I will refer to this communication later. *2. I was most cordially and hospitablywelcomed.     The King of Italy 7/as away from Head-quarters visiting the Italian Fleet.   He sent me a telegram regretting his absence and hoping he would see me on another occasion at an early date* By command of the King I presented the G.C.M.G. to the five Army Commanders, an honour which evidently gave them great pleasure.5t I spent one whole day and a half of two others atthe front, in the open, and at a distance of 3,000 to 4,000 yard3 from the enemy&apos;s trenches,   During this time I did not see or hear a single aeroplane; I did not hear a rifle or machine gun; and a high estimate of the number of artillery rounds I heard is fifty.     In fact there was &quot;nothing doing&quot;f andfrom
from what I could learn there seldom is,   The weather was good, but of course there is still much snow about and will be for another month or so, There was a fall of about 3 feet during my visit.-fuch good work has. been done in the way of road making in the hills, and I was struck by the large amount of civilian labour employed.   There are some 250,000 labourers at work in the war zone alone not only on&quot;the roads but in making defences.   The troops arc well hutted, and the officers particularly so.   They seem to be rather too comfortable and to be settled down fcr an indefinite period.     The general impression one gets is that the Italian Army is very much on the defensive, I heard much about the various defensive lines - some of which seem to be more neat and symmetrical than useful - but I did not hear a word as to offensive projects.Hospital arrangements and all other rearward services appear to be efficiently organised, and apparently there is no lack of food, clothing, stores or transport. General Cadorna expressed himself as &quot;content&quot; regarding the ammunit ion supply, but naturally added that he would like to have more heavy artillery notwithstanding that he is better off than he was last year.     He would also like to have more field guns, so as to make better use of the large number of infantry.battalions he has got,    I may mention that for our 62 Divisions on the &apos;,7est Front we have 2,985 field guns and 1,414 heavier- guns and howitzers. For the 53 Italian Divisions there are 1898 Field guns and 1,896 heavier guns and howitzers.   Of the 1,896 , however, 883 are classed as old pattern, but they are old mainly to the extent of having a less range andfiring
firing at a somewhat slower rats than the newer patterns. Another point to notice is that the Italian front is far longer than ours; but as against this a much smaller amount of artillery is needed in the mountains than on ground such as that on the YTest front. .The men I saw were of splendid physique, and looked cheerful, healthy, and likely to prove excellent fighters if properly led.     As to this I have grave doubts so far as the senior officers are concerned. The regulations in Italy are based on promotion by age and service and not by merit, with the result that the Senior Commanders are far too old, to say nothing of the other qualifications which they may lack-.General. Gadorna is probably the best selection that could be made-.      He is active and energetic for his age, 66 years, and I should think possesses strong character * .-General Porro his sub-chief of the Staff, is about 64 years of age.    He is weak in character, and far too much of an office man.     Most people wonder why Cadorna keeps him.Of the 5 Army Commanders the&quot;Duke of Aosta is generally regarded as. being the best.       He is about 56 years of age, and gave me the impression of being adequate-ly up to his work.   The remaining 4 Army Commanders gave me quite a contrary impression.     White faces and white hands and other indications shew that theso officers spend far more time in their comfortablo headquarters than thayi spend at the. front.-   One of them is a weak and effeto old gentleman of 70 years and looking more;    another isnot
not much better except that he is a few years younger; the two others though of better physique aro both over 60 years.     The Italian Army itself thinks, I understand, that the Army Commanders, as well as some of the Corps Commanders, are much too old and worn out for their work.The Divisional Commanders are of a better stamp, but they also would be none the worse for being younger.   A better selection of them is being made.    I was told that the only General who had done really good work during the war is the young and junior commander who took Gorizia0 He now commands the &quot;Gorizia zone&quot;.What disturbed me most about the Army Commanders was that one and all ?/ere full of dismal forebodings regarding the possibility of a German attack.   It is not an exaggeration to say that some of them are already half beaten, although they have not yet seen a German- It is a pity that such promising men should have Senior leaders of the type I have described,  in whom they can have no confidence.    To the best of my ability I took every oppor tunity to convince the Commanders that the German Army is greatly inferior to what it was two years ago; that the internal conditions of Germany are very bad; that the Italian. British and French armies are morQ^fTicdent&quot; and better equipped, now than before; and I used other similar arguments in the hope of inspiring a little confidence in thoir troubled breasts. The invariable reply was that the Russian revolution might set free a .. largo number of Austrian and German Divisions for employ-ment&apos;-on-the Italian front; that the same result might accrue from the German retirement on the Western front; that the German army was a marvel of organisation and skill? and in general my observations were received with much head-shaking and unmistakeable incredulity. Ibre than oreof the /
5.44the Commanders to whom I spoke asked me if I really believed what I had said as to the situation being favourable to us.    I am therefore not at all sanguine that my efforts to create a brighter view of our prospects were successful, and the conclusion I have reached is that we cannot expect much assistance from Italy unless and until some of the present commanders are replaced b:/ younger and more courageous men who are not so absolutely scared by the German danger.9. As regards the political situation, I gathered therewas,a feeling of some disappointment in the Italianis said that the Italians feel that we are too much under French influence and, therefore, treat our other Ally, Italy, with a lack of fairness,   Our understanding with France in respect of Asia Minor, without consulting Italy, is apparently one sore point; *vihile another is the &quot;expedition to JERUSALEM&quot;, in which the French are participating and which came only indirectly to the knowledge of the Italian Government.   I do not pretend to know what truth there may be in this alleged irritation,10. The strategical situation is, in some ways, notunlike that of Roumania last autumn.    On declaring war Roumania marched into Transylvania without adequately securing Bucharest on her line of communications between east and west and distant from the frontier about 30 miles.    Italy on going to war instead of occupying, as she could have done, the Trentlno salient, hurried the bulk of her troops eastwards towards Trieste, leaving her line of communication between east and. to at exposed to attack at Vicenza, some 20 milesour attitude on various points,    Itfrom/
m- -   - -* - .. . -from the Frontier.   She nearly lost her communications&apos;::.-:V&apos;.&apos; i Ilast year, and now that there is a probability of theAustrians being reinforced she is more than ever nervous(as she may well be) about an attack across the Trentinofront.     I suggested to Cadorna that he should kill twobirds with one stone and defend his Trentino front byattacking there instead of continuing to hanker after anoffensive towards Trieste, which must necessarily crumpleup on the first threat of an attack from the Trentino.This he said he could not do because of the difficult natureof the terrjain.     ivhen I said that if the terrain prevented    jhim from attacking it should also       safeguard him frombeing attacked, he answered that the enemy had a muchgreater depth of the difficult ground - which isquite true but is not a sufficient answer - and thatthe enemy had also made very strong defensive works-.Upon this I observed that presumably he also hadsuch works, having so much labour available, buthe. said that he had not anything like so good defencesas the enemy had. \t11. He further argued that he can produce the best effectby attacking on the Isonzo front because he can there contain j a greater number of the enemy; but that as he cannot attack there until the Trentino menace disappears,he must await this before c-ommencing his attack.    I pointed outthati
that this course would allow the enemy to do as he liked, and that his &quot;best plan would he if, as lie said, he could not attack in the Trentino, to attack forthwith, on the Isonzo and so draw there the enemy divisions which might otherwise be sent to the Trentino. But he did not agree with this view.12., I drew his attention to tho fact thatwhereas the Austrians had only about 450 battalions he had more than double that number, and that although it was of course for him to decide how best he could assist in the general offensive it was clear that he was not at present pulling his full weight, and that I hoped he would do something more in April than await developments.General livolle, in his letter, also pressed him to take the offensive early in April, on whichever front he deemed desirable. CadornaTs reply to us both was that he would be as active on &quot;both fronts as possible, con-si stent with the formation of an adequate reserve on the Trentino front.,    I am afraid this will not amount to much. -
The fact is Cadorna was not inclined to discuss offensive operations of any kind, and displayed much impatience while I endeavoured to pin him down to them as the first subject for discussion.. Having done all I could in this respect we turned to the possibility of a situation arising which might necessitate sending British or French reinforcements.    As a beginning I tried to make him state- what hostile force he thought he could resist without help, and eventually he placed It at 50 to 60 Divisions.    He himself has 53, while in battalions he not only has double the number the enemy has now got, but they are of much greater strength,^ 1,300 or 1,4-00 men each.. I remarked that, In these circumstances, he might hope to resist more that 50 to 60 Divisions, but against this he urged his weakness in artillery in proportion to his in-fantry.   When asked why Italy had not produced more new artillery during the post year he replied it was largely due to the want of coal and steel.A fortnight ago he estimated that the enemy might employ on his front as many as 90 Divisions.    He now puts the number at 80..   Exactly what it may be - assuming that any increase Is made - will depend, upon the result of the operations on the West Front, and the effect of the revolution in Russia.    His chief argument for the despatch of reinforcements was that If a heavy attack were made upon him from the Trentlno ho might, if not reinforced, have to withdraw from the Isonso front in order to cover his communications, and. this would mean the fall of the Government and the entry Into power of the peace party.. - This view is probably correct.    He admitted that it was not feasible to say now definitely what reinforcements should or could, in the given contingency,, be sent, but he asked that theprinciples
&quot;principle&quot; of sending assistance should be authoritatively accepted, and for the necessary preliminary arrangements to be worked out forthwith.In accordance with what I understand to be the policy of the War Cabinet I was anxious to assure him of our desire to assist in case of need, but as we are at present committed to employ our whole forces in combination with the French I could only tell him so, and add that his views would be laid before the War Cabinet, who, I felt sure, would give them the most sympathetic consideration, and would, I thought, approve of the &quot;principle&quot; but that the extent to which practical effect could be given to It must obviously be governed by the general situation at the tims* He admitted this and appeared to be quite satisfied with my statement, and during my visit did not again refer to it, I promised that an early reply to his request should be s ent, 1 No agreement or other written document was drawn up as a result of the discussion,     Cadorna did not ask that it should be, and I did not suggest it,I trust the War Cabinet will not think that I was unduly hard in pressing Cadorna to take a greater share of the war. My opinion was, and Is, that before considering the question of reinforcements Italy must first make the best use of her own resources for her defence^, and she is not yet doing that, and in addition she is in a miserable state of funk long before she need be.     Further, she persists in pursuing, for political reasons, a wrong objective - Trieste-,   Her-proper objective - as in all cases - is the enemy1 s army-. If she deals successfully with that, Trieste will look after itself,
16. The French attitude in the matter of reinforcements wasrepresented by a statement in Nivelle&apos;s letter that if the need for help should arise - which he rightly thinks is not yet certain - and if he is able to give help, he will then refer the matter to the French War Cabinet for consideration.   Cadorna was not satisfied with this, as he said it might involve loss of time at a critical period, and therefore that he wished for the &quot;principle&quot; to be considered and accepted by the French new.I may add that the French representatives reported to Wivelie on their return what I had said at the Conference, and when I met him on passing t/rough France yesterday he told me that his views regarding the whole question of Italian operations were exactly the same as mine, and he thanked me for putting them before Cadorna, 17* Transport and supply arrangements for the despatchof troops from the West Front to Italy have already been worked cut between the French and Italian Staffs, and Cadorna told me he Was quite satisfied in that respect.     He gladly accepted my suggestion that both the French and ourselves should send some Staff officers to get into touch with the Italian Army and to make themselves personally acquainted with the ground and other local conditions...     I propose to see to this at, once and to establish closer relations in general with Cadorna.     I understood frcm ilivelle that he also will probably send some officers-IB,. I suggest that His MajestyJs Government shouldinform the Italian Government of their readiness to help., but this must be done in a duly guarded manner, becausei * ill
it is quite impossible to say now what help we could giw, or whether it would be wise to give it if we could.   If the Italians fight so badly as to need very large reinforcements it will be necessary to consider whether their despatch would be the best means of ensuring final success.   There may be maiy important factors to take into account, political as well as military, and one of them will certainly be man-power..   The strength of the French Army is gradually diminishing, and they have few reserves to fall back upon, while, as the War Cabinet know, our own Divisions will soon begin to decrease in strength.    I feel sure that the French will never send a large number of troops, and I doubt if they will send any;     Apart, from the not very friendlyfeeling between the two Nations, the French have to think of expelling the enemy from their. own country.(Signed)    W. R\ ROBERTSON, 27-3-1917. Chief of the Imperial General Staff.
