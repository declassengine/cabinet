0145/557. . War Cabinet.Assistance to the Venizelist Army. .Note by the Secretary of State for-War. iIn obedience to instructions from the War Cabinet 97(9) had a reconsideration by Departments concerned of the decision previously conveyed to the Cabinet.,  that it would bo impossible for us to help M. Venizelos in the manner suggested in Lord Granville&apos;s telegrams.I have been unable to lay the result, of this reconsideration before the War Cabinet before this date.as the two telegrams from Lord Granville of March 1st. (No,108) and March&apos; 4th (No.117) were, so conflicting that&apos;it was necessary to telegraph to Salonika. (Foreign Office telegram 101 cf 18th March) to clear up the position.     The telegram of the 1st March spoke of 60,000 men and that of March 4th only mentioned the Oretan Division.     The telegram&quot;received from Lord Granville of.21st March (Ho. 145) makes it  clear that, what we are asked to do is to undertake the feeding and medical treatment, of the Cretan Division,&apos; which is estimated at 10,000 men rising to 15,000.First of all.with regard to the feeding.      I do not think that this would be possible as our reserve stock at. Salonika, is already dangerously, low, and the Q,.M,G. is afraid cf adding to the number drawing on this reserve.     It could only, therefore, be&apos;done at.the expense cf our food reserves v/hich are already much lower than.the General Staff consider safe.With regard to medical service,  Sir Alfred Keogh would be ready to undertake the Base Hospital accommodation for the Cretan Division, but he could not find Doctors for the various battalions,&apos; and in the event of the War Cabinet deaiding that we should undertake the medical treatment at the Ease&apos;, I will telegraph to Lord Granville to ascertain whether local Doctors could not be found for the various Battalions, we undertaking to supply them with all such necessaries as drugs, dressings, instruments &amp;c.2nd April, 1917.

GREECE. MILITARY.Decypher.   Lord Granville (Saionica). March 1st, 1917.p. 12,30 p.m. March 1st, 1917. R. 5 p.m. March 2nd, 1917,No. 108.Sir Armand Ruffer who has been here some three months organising Greek Red Cross is extremely anxious about the situation and prospects of Venizelist Army from sanitary point of view.    There f are now nominally 10,000 men at the front and there are 1,100 beds.   I MuVenizelos tells him that he hopes very shortly to have 40,000 men  1 at the front and 20,000 here in reserve;    French consider 4,000 beds \\ ample but they have only just ordered 4V000 &quot;lits Brancards&quot; (a superior sort of stretcher) and it is likely to be very long before they can arrivev    Sir Armand considers 6,000 beds the minimum for these numbers.   He has been training nursing staff but it is most inadequate and male hospital orderlies are practically non-exietent. I He describes the Greek troops as very dirty and their camp here a breeding place for lice and infection;    they cannot be kept out of overcrowded towns and as soon as there is any disease they will scatter it through the civilian population.    I have consulted unofficially one of the principal Army doctors who confirms the above except that he thinks 4,000 beds might be sufficient provided French intend to evacuate convalescents to the Islands or elsewhere.Sir Armand has explained his plans to M. Venizelos who told him he means to ask me whether His Majesty&apos;s Government will take over at least a considerable portion of his troops, have them on our front and be responsible for their food, hrspital treatment etc   M. Venizelos dines with me March 3rd and will probably take that opportunity and I should be glad to know by then if possible &apos;what line I should take.     I imagine there would be no difficulty about feeding troops if we took them over but I gather we have no surplus hospital accommodation,     M. Venizelos said a word to me the other day about taking Cretan Corps on our front and said that General Sarrail had unwillingly consented to his making the suggestion.All experts here seem unanimously fearing an epidemic as soon as heat begins as town is so overcrowded and surrounded by hospitals many of them not in a very sanitary condition and I feel therefore that the question of these Greek troops is a very serious   \* one.An obvious solution would be not to allow M. Venizelos to bring any more troops here at all but this would be a very serious if net fatal blow to his movement and it seems difficult to do this after encouragement which we have given hiia.
MILITARY.-GKEEC3.Decypher.   Lord Granville (Salonica)  ;March 4 th.D. 6.15 p.m.-  ,March 4th, 1917. R. 9.45 p,m.Ho. 117.My telegram 2To. 108 of March 1st.Moneieur Venezeles and General Milne dined with me last night and Monsieur Venezelos asked me to send to His Majesty&apos;s Government following message which I have submitted to General Milne .Monsieur Venezelos is anxious that the Cretan division which he hopes to he able to bring here shortly should be placed under General Milne&apos;s orders on British i&quot;rrnt as it is there that they will meet their traditional enemy on Greek soil. Ke asked General Sarrail&apos;s consent to approach General Milne on the subject.     General Sarrail at first refused but on. Monsieur Venezelos&apos; explaining his reason reluctantly consented. Additional reason for Monsieur Venezelos&apos; desire though he insisted it is a petty one, is that the French have not supplied sufficient hospital accommodation and he hopes that His Majesty&apos;s Government will supply what is required for this division if they take it over.General Milne assured Monsieur Venezelos that he has no personal objection but that the question is not one which he can decide as decision rests with General Sarrail or the Allied Governments.     General Milne added that only condition that he himself would make would be that troops should be entirely administered by him (food, hospital treatment etc.) He enquired as to equipment and Monsieur Venezelos said that their clothes have been provided by the French and are in Crete, that rifles ammunition etc. are ready here and that General C-ennin considers that all necessary beasts can be requisitioned in Crete as soon as mobilisation &apos; is ordered, but no artillery is available.Please reply as soon as possible as Monsieur Venezelos is anxious to mobilize in Crete without delay.
