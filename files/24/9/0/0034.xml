WAR&apos; CA^lMT.g.t. ggg. 176SECRET.^ OPERATIONS.Prom:-   M.A.Roumania to C.I.G.S.Marcli 26 th. 19:17.G.B.474.        From trustworthy sources I learn that there is some dissatisfaction among;Roumanian Officers directed against the ling and the present Government.     I am unable to (one group undecipherable) say how far this has spread to the rank and file, out efforts are Lindoubtedly being made to discredit both King aid Prime Minister in the eyes of the Army, and at the same time to increase the prestige of General Averescu.     In my opinion the latter is only the tool of a political clique, whose nominal (?) leader is M.Take Jonescu.    This clique wants to get the present Government out at any cost, and anyone supporting it is the object of intrigue, as the King refuses to part with M.Bratiano His Majesty himself is attacked.   The King has never liked or (grou] omitted)ed General Averescu, and the latter may for this reason have lent himself to a movement which, in my opinion, he is incapable of controlling, and yet-the consequences will be disastrous.There is some talk of a military dictatorship in Roumania, tut for the moment no dictator has been found except General Averescu, whose qualities have been over-rated for political reasons by the political party to which he belongs.     The King&apos;s position is most difficult, and recent events in Russia have served to increase his anxiety.    I believe that any action on our part which would show our sympathy Y/ith the King and present Government would be appreciated greatly, and I suggest the advisability of conferring some high decoration on General Presan. He is the most capable of the Roumanian generals, and a thoroughly loyal and honest man.
