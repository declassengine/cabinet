The sanction of the Lords Commissioners ef H.fi.Treasury to the draft Royal ^arrant for the pensions of Soldiers disabled and of the families and dependants of Soldiers deceased in consequence   of the present war, and to the corresponding Order in Council relating to Seamen and Marines, was received on the 28th instant and on the same day the former document was sent to the Private Secretary to the King and the latter to the Privy Council Office for submission to His Majesty,     A notification of the Warrant h having been signed has been received and a copy of It as so signed is annexed as Appendix I to this Report,The -&quot;arrant and the Order are to take effect &quot;from the first weekly pay day after the 1st of April&quot; i,e, April 4th,     The reassessment of pensions will It is hoped be completed by that date, as far as permanent pensions to disabled soldiers and sailors and pensions to widows are concerned.     Conditional pensions will be reassessed at the expiry of the conditional periods and the arrears accruing from the 4th April will then be paid2.     .        Since the submission of last weekls report the campaign to get pensions for men discharged on account of disability neither attributable to ncr aggravated by military service has been vigorously pressed by Mr, Hogge.     The opportunity afforded by the debate on the second reading of the MMitary Service (Review of Exceptions) Bill on the 29th instant was taken by him to move that &quot;This Eouse declines to proceed with the Pill until the Government is prepared to accept full responsibility in regar,   &quot;O providing pensions fc:.-such men as, having been accepted for service by the Army Medical Authorities, are subsequently discharged from service owing to disability not caused by their own wilful misccnduThe
Tho points taken by &quot;&apos;-&quot;r* ;&quot;0 ge.. and. succeeding -speakers -o su^r-ortod his amendment n/ere, so far as re^a/ds thequestion of pensions to men of the class in question;        -\(a) That the system of medical examination in the past had, in fact, resulted in a number variously estimated as anything between one hundred thousand and tiro hundred and fifty thousand men being accepted for service who were subsequently discharged as unfit, and there was no reason to expect, that this would not continue.(b) That if the Government found it necessary in order to obtain a sufficient supply of men to re-examine men who had been rejected,&apos; they should in return recognise their responsibility towards such men as were accepted for service under the Bill and later on discharged when found to be unfit.(c) That some protection of the kind suggested in (b) was all the more necessary in view of the pledges which had been given by the Government in the past to the effect that men medically rejected would not be liable to re-examination*On behalf cf the Government it was pointed out that the re-examination of rejected men among other classes did not mean that men would be placed in a medical category different from that for which they were properly qualified, and that while it must be admitted that in some respects, especially at the begin, ning of the- War, the medical examination had not been altogether satisfactory, this was due to the groat rush of recruits and th . hurry with which the work had necessarily to be performed,,     Tha Chancellor of tho Exchequer, however, gave an assurance that, he would take steps after communication with the War Office to sec if it were possible, for tho medical examination of recruits to he improved 4On the general question of the title to pension or gratuity in the case of men.whose disability was found to &quot;fee neither attri-butahle to nor aggravated by service, the Government undertook to consider, in consultation with the Ministry of Pensions and the Cabinet,-Whether an independent Tribunal could not be set up to review the decision arrived at and to come to. a final decision whether or not in any such case the man should get a gratuity, or a pensions ,. .        &apos; &apos;.&apos;:*.!...,
r .   1233, The Committee stage of the Haval and Military TJarpensions Administrative Expenses Bill was taken on llonday the -2 th instant.     Various amendments. o  minor importance proposed by the Sovernmeni were accepted by tho Committee and some proposed by Members were a-cceptod by the Government.One of the latter was an amendment moved by Mr. Lawrence Hardy and Sir Ryland Atkins to ensure to the Local Authority, liable to pay the Administrative Expenses of a Committee, control over those expenses.     The form of the amendment was, however, left in a state which required jnodification on the Report stage.iA prolonged discussion arose on amendments, moved by llr. Y/atson and llr, Duncan Hi liar with a view to increasing the proportion of administrative expenses to be borne by the Exchequer.     The point raised by more than one. speaker which appeared to carry more weight in the House, was that the one-half of the expenses falling upon local rates would involve a far heavier charge in seme cases than in. others and an instance was quoted of a place in Ireland where: a penny in the pound on the rateable value produced only  50.     In the end the amendments were rejected on the Minister under-taking to bring to the notice of the Treasury tho feeling expressed by the House in the matter with a vdew&apos; to possible amendment on the Report stage -The amendment moved by Sir Eorval Holme and others to remove the necessity for the llinister to consult with a County Council before establishing Local Committees with reduced powers, within its area resulted in a long debate, which was ended by the defeat of the motion on a division by 134 to 59.Considerable
Considerable discussion took placo on the unsatisfUct-ory-position of the metropolitan boroughs. under   Section 2 (4) the Principal Act as interpreted and administerecb. by the London County Council and an amendment was mcvcd by Sir George Touche to insert a new clause requiring the establishment, of District Committees-^ withiir three&apos; months cf the passing of the Bill.     The members representing the London County Council deprecated very strongly upsetting- the organisation&apos;-of the Lai dam County-Committee; but Mr Percy Harris of that Committee- intimated that in his view Local Boroughs: should be given part in the adiriinis-tration of the pension8&apos;of the County, and the Minister suggested that before the report stagey representatives of the Boroughs and the, County should agree on a clause on the lines proposed! by Sir George- Touche but with an extension of the time limit.An amendment, was moved by Mr. Barnes and accepted without discussiom, to provide that the persom holding the office of Chairman or Vice-Chairman on the Statutory Committee&apos; should not by reason of his office, be incapable in being elected to, or voting in the Commons Rouse of Parliament..     The object  of this amendment, was to give power to appoint the-   Parliamentary/ Secretary to the Ministry as Vice-Chairman, of the Statutory Committee and thus to make closer the bonds between the two organisations.A copy of the Bill as amended in Committee formsAppendix II to this report.The Report Stage of the Bill was taken on Thursday29th instant.   Before the Report was moved, however,   the Bill was re - committed, on the motion of the Minister
Minister in order to move amendments to Clause 1 of th.e Bill to provide for the repayment by tlie Exchequer of two-thirds of the administrative expenses of Local Committees in the place of one-half as proposed in the draft Bill.   The amendments were accepted by the House with very little discussion.On the Report Stage, the chief topics of debatewere: -(a)   An amendment moved by Sir George Touche to provide for the appointment of District Committees in London for each Metropolitan Borough and the City of London within six months after the termination of the war. This arrangement had, it was understood, been agreed to by representatives of the Metropolitan Boroughs and of the London Pensions Committee, but objection was taken that the London County Council whose scheme would have to be modified had not been consulted, and in the circumstances the MiniiB%er was unable to accept the Clause; but he intimated that if before the Bill was finally disposed of an agreed clause could be arrived at, the Government would accept it.(b) Subsection 2 of the Bill was, after informal negotiation with members who represented the County Councils&apos; Association, amended so as to make it clear that the estimates of administrative expenses would be subject to the approval of the Local Authority called upon to bear the expenses before submission to the Local Government Board,(c) Clause 5 of the Bill, with the further amendment moved by the Minister, was intended to enable theParliamentary
Paoi?ldaiaen.tary&apos;Scc-retary tc become- eirther--Ch&amp;Arman or Vice-Chairman of the Statutory Committee,     Ob^pectlor^. was taken tc the Clause on the ground that it would admit of practically four representatives c.f Pensions administration sitting on the front bench.   It was made clear by the Minister that there was no intention of this and in, the course of further discussion the Govern-ment were strongly pressed to amend the Clause so as. to provide that only the Chairman of the Statutory Committee if a Member of the House should be exempted from vacating his seat or seeking re-election.     The Clause in this form y/as accepted.The Bill as amended was then read a third time and carried without division^4.     As a result of the Conference referred to in para-graph 10 of the report for the Period from 10th March to 16th liar ch a Bill has been prepared on behalf of the National Health Insurance Joint Committee in consultation with the llinistry to amend the National Health Insurance (Part 1 amendment); Act, 1915, which reduced the amount, of sickness benefit to which a discharged soldier was entitled if he was. in receipt of a total disablement pension, and further provided that he should not be entitled to receive dis ablenient be nef it,The draft Bill provides that a   man who have been awarded a pension in respect of disablement of the highest degree or a pension of a greater   amount granted in lieu thereof or an allowance in lieu of pension, equal in amount to a pension of the highest ddgree of disablement, shall be entitled only to a reduced rate of sickness benefit during the time that he is in receipt of such pension or allowance., but it is further   provided that the man mayjreinstate himself in full sickness   benefit if and when he has worked for 26 weeks (or 104 weeks for the purposes of disablement benefit),,
The Bill provides on similar lines for a discharged man who.is granted &quot;a gratuity of not less than  30, any portion of which is in respect of temporary totaldisablement&quot;.The Bill also contains an important provision by which it will be possible for a discharged man who is not insured and therefore is not entitled to medical or sanatorium benefit to receive such benefits out of the Navy and Army Insurance Fund under Regulations which the Insurance Commis si oners are empo?/ered to make for the purpose.5.        Appended to the Report for the period from the 25th January to the 15th February was a scheme by which there should be refunded to Approved Societies under the National Health Insurance Acts the cost of sickness and disablement benefits paid by them to discharged invalided soldiers and sailors for disabilities due to war service. This scheme formed the subject of correspondence between the National Health Insurance Commissioners, the Treasury and this Ministry and on the 28th instant the sanction of the Treasury was givon to it upon the understanding that the National Health Insurance Joint Committee would keep the matter under careful and regular supervision and would take every action in their power to detect and check laxity in administration of which the consequences would fall upon the Exchequer.     The Treasury sanctioned the assumption of liability as from the commencement of the war but concurred in the suggestion of the Ministry that the scheme should hold good only until the end of the year 1920.     Provision to cover the cost of the Scheme *wouid in due course be- asked for from Parliament in the estimates for the Pensions Ministry.
6.        The report of the statutory Committee giving details of the work done and the reports received by them during the week is annexed as Appendix III.Satisfactory accounts have been received of the working of the Local Committees at Southend, where 800 to 900 cases are dealt with weekly, at Oxford, where disabled men are getting good situations in the Colleges and at Warrington, where, however, there are exceptional difficulties owing apparently to it being a tt&amp;Ua of passage.     There is no difficulty in placing discharged disabled soldiers at Blackburn or Derby, the Midland Railway employing the majority at the latter place.   At Burton-on-Trent on the other hand there appear to be obstacles in the way of their employment on account of the restrictions to brewing and at Swindon there has been some trouble with regard to Class 17        who have been discharged on obtaining employment in the interval before they commence to draw wages.     The Ministry is forwarding to the ,7/ar Office reports made to the statutory Committee in this matter.In Ireland, the Cork Committee are in a state of suspended animation on account of the proposal that the Local Authority should be called upon to pay a share of the administrative expenses of the Committee, and generally the working of the Local Committees in certain parts of Ireland seems unsatisfactory.A report of the Trade Advisory Committee on the Willow and Cane Industry has had to be referred back to the Committee, some of the conditions which it embodied not being considered workable.Appendix IV hereto shows what advance has been made towards getting training schemes approved andformulated
/ - -formulated for all the localities with which the Statutory Committee   have been in correspondence on the subject up to the 28th March. 7.        The Minister of Pensions attended a public Meeting at Tonypandy on Friday 23rd instant, and explained to an audience of about 1,000 persons including the Members of the Rhondda Valley War Pensions Committee, the provisions of the New Warrant of which satisfaction was expressed.On the same day the Parliamentary Secretary and Sir Charles Nicholson, Chairman of the London Disablements Committee, visited Bristol where a Confer^ . on the subject of training was held with Delegatesfrom the Borough and County Committees of Berks, Dorset, Wilts, Somerset, and Gloucester.   Representatives of the Bristol Committee who had held aloof from previous deliberations - for - joint:actioniwerepresent, at the special request of the Minister.    : - . :&apos;  &apos;The Minutes&apos; of the Conference form Appendix V to this report, and1from (13) it will be seen that it was decided to form a: joint Executive &quot;Committee.for training and treatment under- the Chairmanship- of Mr. Henry Hobhouse, and cons i sting of - one representative from each-&apos; of the War tensions Committees of Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Dorset, Gloucester        (City-), Gloucestershire, Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire, with Professor-Wertheimer of the Merchant Venturers College;as Honorary Secretary.   Berks and Reading- were not specifically included as it was thought they would prefer to - join With Hants. v-&apos;:     -&apos;-ltj&quot;- D&apos;-1-:&quot;-&quot;After0the Conference the offices *of the&apos; Bristol&apos;-War ^Tensions lC^ and the work done ;there found to be good&apos;;       &quot;1 &apos; 1   :&apos; -    &quot;&apos;      -  &quot;&apos; -
)The Chairman of the Bristol Chamber of Commercewas interviewed and promised to submit to the Chamber a proposal that the Llembers should interest themselves in the commercial training and subsequent employmentof disabled men.On Saturday 24th Hareh, the Minister held a Conference at Cardiff with the Lord Ivlayojr, Deputy Lord Mayor/5 and the Town Clerk of that City, the Director of Education and the Secretary of the Local War Pensions Committee. Reference was made to a scheme prepared by the Local Committee, which included the utilization of the Whitchurch Institute., f 1,200 beds.) for the treatment and training af disabled soldiers and sailors.       This Institution, oi which one wing is reserved for orthopaedic cases, has attached to it, Bakeries, and Engineering, Metal, Woodwork; brushwork , and Weaving workshops, as well as a Farm.   &apos; ao present there are civilian, mental deficients in a part of the building but it is proposed to remove them so that the whole accomodation can be made available for disabled soldiersand sailors.The Minister afterwards visited the new Cardiff Technical Schools where considerable facilities are available for training disabled men who might be billited in the locality of the Schools.       He also discussed with the Local Authorities the work of the Prince of Wales Hospital (Cardiff) for limbless men. 3. At the seventh meeting of the Committee ofInstitutional Treatment held on the 30th Liarch it was reported as regards paraplegics that in addition to 115&apos; who had been treated at the Star and Garter at Richmond of YJhom 65: were there now, 3-1 had been placed in 23 Hospitals near their hcones and 76 cases were now beingconsidered
considered with a view to similar action.   It was decided that the cost of maintenance for these men, which up to the 4th April would be borne by tho Red Cross Society, should be defrayed after that date under the Royal Warrant at the rate of 6/- per man per day, and ,   that 2/- was to be deducted from the man!s pension for maintenance.     It was also decided that only pensionable cases could be dealt with under the Warrant and that they would go directly from the military to the civil Hospitalswithout passing through the Local Committees, the Local-Committees being notified of the action taken.   It was agreed that in future the same amount for maintenance should be deducted at the Star and Garter as was to be deducted at the ordinary Civil Hospitals.As regards tuberculous patients it was reported that the Metropolitan Asylums Board would be able to provide at a charge of 5/- per day about 100 beds for advanced cases of tuberculous soldiers and sailors in pavilions annexed to the various hospitals in their charge. This proposal was accepted as doing away with the necessity for taking over Claremont and thus avoiding considerable administrative difficulties.     The whole question of tuberculous patients,, however, was one in which Various departments were interested and it was decided that it would be advisable for Mr. Barnes and Lord Rhondda to summon a Conference on the subject of the Local Govern-ment Board, National Health Insurance Commissioners, the London War Pensions Committee, the London County Council and the Metropolitan As.flams Board.A report //as ^eoelyed on Maghull, the Epileptic Colony near Livorp ^ol .-The
The question was-considered1 of^rljaging ^^rVh^rpa&amp;ilc-:&apos;.v / .. -&apos; -&apos;        /-.&quot;&apos;, ;v&apos;: &apos;hospitals under tho Institutional Treatment Committee and alsothat of arranging for Institutional Treatment in various areas jihich would combine those of a number of Local Committees.     It waS decided to communicate with the Joint Committee that had already been appointed in connection with the combination of areas for training facilities in order to get information as to the Institutions within their areas.Tables I and II show that 9,501 pensions including Children1 s Allowances were granted during the week, against 8,944 during the previous week, and that 566,584 have been awarddd from the commencement, of the war up to the 28th instant.Table II shows that during the last week 210 grants of Supplementary Pensions and Temporary Allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 192 in the previous week, and that the total up to date is 2477.10. The staff of the Ministry not including that of theStatutory Committee has been increased by 57 during the week and now consists of 195 men and 2435 women, or 2630 in all, the: additions being to the women clerks in the Award to Soldiers and in the Issue Eranches,     The staff of the Statutory Committee number 63 men and 151 women or 214 in all, bringing up the grandtotal to 2844.The epidemic of measles at the Tate Gallery still Results in a high per centage of sickness in the female staff (11.4).     The percentages both at Chelsea and the Pensions Issue Office 7.8 and 7.9 respectively also can scarcely be considered satisfactory*      Medical inspections of these various brancnes hr a Lady Doctor from the Post Office are being arranged,
11.      An additional--lillitary&apos;X)ffl^e^-disab0j94,.anxl unfit for further service in the present war has been added to the staff making awards of soldiers pensions at Chelsea.   There are now four such Officers there in addition to the six senior award Officers who have been employed on the work for some time.     Another Military Officer also disabled and unfit for further service in the present Y/ar has been placed in the branch .*of the Ministry dealing with awards to Officers in order to assist the head of the branch in making those awards. It, had been contemplated placing a suitable disabled Naval Officer in the Branch awarding pensions to Seamen, but the Admiralty were unable to spare such an Officer. The Minister, had, however, received many representations including some from Naval Officers of high rank, that it would be desirable to appoint for the staff a representative of the Navy who had actually served among the ratings of a lower deck and would be able to represent their cases from intimate personal experience of their lives and surroundings.     Treasury sanction has therefore been asked to the appointment of a T/arrant rriter now employed in the Signal Section of the War staff at the Admiralty, who is understood to be suitable.12.        On the 29th instant the Secretary of the Ministrywas called upen to give evidence before a Committee con-sisting of Sir Joseph Compton-Rickett, M.P. as Chairmanand Lord Middelton, and Sir Charles Henry M.P. as Members,which had been appointedTo enquire into the growth and development of public departments from the outbreak of War to the present time, to report upon the Increase in per-sonnel and the expansion of premises, and to consider and report how far such increase and expansion have been correspondent with and justified by the changedconditions
conditions induced by the Far;   to report whether there is avaoidable overlapping in the work of such departments:     and generally to consider and report upon matters which in the opinion of the Committee are relevant and important in relation to the above matter9The organisation of the Pensions Ministry andthe method by which its staff had been brought togetherwere explained to the Committee, and they were informedas to the growth of the work and the increase of staffrendered necessary thereby.     Special interest was shownby Sir Charles Henry in the question of accommodation andthe extent to which the work of the Department would havebeer., facilitated had it been placed under one roof, and byLord Middelton and the Chairman in the question of overtime,and the possibility of decreasing it by shifting the stafffrom one branch of the work to another.The information with regard to overtime andaccommodation that was given to the Committee, was based onthe statements annexed as Appendices VI. and VII. to thisReport.An estimate was hazarddd to the Committee, that if the War continued to the end of the present year and the number of casualties during this year were the same as during last, the total staff on the 31st December 1917 might number between 3,500 and 4,000,Lord Middelton who had spoken against Section 3 of the Ministry of Pensions Act 1916 when it was before the House of Lords as not dealing satisfactorily with the relations between the Ministry of Pensions and the Statutory Committee, asked various questions with a viev/ to ascertain-ing the extent to which the functions-of the two bodies over-lapped in the matter of the award of pensions.     He enquired, though not for publication in the Committee^Report
report,, the views of the Secretary as to the desirability of the Statutory Committee continuing to exist, and was informed that in the Secretary1s opinion this was desirable until the e-d of the war.M. N.30th March 1917.

The total number of cases which have been dealt with is 2,700.     Cases weekly average between 800 to 900.     The Labour Bureau works in conjunction with the Committee, making a fortnightly report. - -Our Inspector reporting on the Local&apos;Committoo at Oxford states that tho Committee is paying much attention to disabled men in their area and are able to get most cf those who aro in a position to work into good situations
amongst the colleges.Our Inspector reporting on the Warrington Local Com-mitteo.states that there are exceptional difficulties hero bocauso Warrington&quot;is at tho crossroads of several thorough-faros and is composed of a considerable floating element. In many cases employment has been found for disabled men and rotainod by them.     Ho finds the Secretary has taken a con-oiderable interest in tho matter and has been very successful.Our Inspector reporting on Blackburn states that tho Local Committee collaborated with the Labour Lxohange and have boon succossful in finding employment for disabled men except in oases whore the mon will not work.This Committee and others are awaiting the result of the Lancashiro County Committeo as regards training.Our Inspector reporting on the Swindon Local Committee statos that ho finds several grants have been made to men in Class W. n.eservo.     Difficulties with those cases occur almost everywhere.&apos;    ken who are physically unfit are now providod for to seme extent (though 14/- is hardly enough to keep a man with a wife and four children).     Other cases are equally difficult.     A man sent homo on Friday cannot expect the payment of any wages until a fortnight later and it is a pity that the wife&apos;s Separation Allowance should not be continued for a fortnight after his transfer to Class W. kesorve.Our Inspector reporting on Burton-on-Trent states that in view&quot;of tho very serious position of the town of
Burton-on-Trent owing to the brewery restrictions and to the fact that brewing is the only industry, tho Committee feel that they cannot undertake the work involvod in the Register of disabled men.reporting on tho Derby Council Local Committee our Inspector states that a register for discharged soldiers and sailors has been compiled and the new register issued by tho Statutory Committee has been seriously taken in handc So far there are no men being trained but a fow are being treated.     Work is so abundant that all men commence to work immodiatoly they return, the Midland Railway absorbing the greater majority.It is reported by our Inspector for Ireland that the County Council Members of the Cork Local Committee have taken alarm at the provisions of tho Pensions Bill as regards ad-ministrativo expenses, and have declined to make any appoint-monts or to do any work which would involve such expenditure until the County Council had considered the matter further. Our Inspector is of opinion that the County Council will rofuso to allow the Local Committee to start work if they are made liable for any contribution.It is reported by our Inspector for County Monaghan that there are not many disabled soldiers and sailors inthis area and those that cannot bo treated in their own homes- &quot;V   .are treated &quot;in the County Infirmary, free of charge.Reporting on tho Lurgan Local Committee, cur Inspector states that all work in this. Committee is voluntary.   Accounts havo boon made up arftl audited by tho Local auditors to the
31st- December, 1916.An advertisement lias published requesting all disabled soldiers to apply to the Secretary if in need of employment. There have been no replies.Disabled cases are treated in their own hones or in the Union or tubercular hospitals, free of charge.      It should bo mentioned that in Ireland out-patients are ofton treated in Union Hospitals and no stigma attaches to tho patient.DISABLELEHT S BhAilCH.Training and Employment Section.    The Section have received a report from the Trado Advisory Committee for the Willow and Cane Industry in which a rocommendation is made to establish training schools under the control of the Committee instead of the men being trained in tho workshops.The Section have decided not-, to consent to a scheme where the management of tho training school would be taken out of their hands.     Tho poriod of training suggested is throe years and the Committee have been asked who are to maintain tho men during that period and who- i;. to pay for instruction.SCHEMES.(a)   A scheme has been submitted by the Nottingham Local Committee in which it is proposed to train men in Carpentering, Engineering, Electricity, Engineering Tracing and, for a few well-educated persons, in Dispensing.

... 148/ -The Walsall Local Committee and Messrs. Nicholson &amp; Co.&apos;Walsall, have submitted jointly a scheme for the employment of a number of discharged disabled men in assembling of machined parts of small cabinets. They could employ at onco from 20 to 50 such men and eventually up to 1,000.     Tho Local Committee propose further to train men in fancy leather work.

Tubb-Thomas [M.O.H.) and Mr. G.P. YJilson.All the representatives were present except those marked * who sent apologies for absence.(4)     The Master of the Society of Merchant Venturers (MrrR.H. Todd) and the Principal of their College (Dr. Wertheimer) attended.(5)     The Master welcomed those present on behalf of the Merchant Venturers1 Guild and said that the Society hoped that the Conference might be fruitful in good results and would be glad if their College could be of use in the important work of training disabled men.(6)     The Right Hon. Henry Hobhouse was unanimously elected Chairman.(7)     Dr, Uertheimer read a letter from the Minister of Penaions (the Right Hon, G,NU Barnes M.P.) stating that the iclea as expressed in the Royal V/arrant, was that training and treatmont of disabled soldiers shoo.Id be carried out over aroas wider than those of the Local Committees; that the Ministry thought the Country mcLght be divided into areas similar to those suggested in Dr. V/ertheimer1 s memorandum and that inthose
those areas there should be some sort of co-operation of the Local Committees on a book-keeping basis so that the facilities for technical and practical training should be pooled in such a way as to enable any Committee to have access to any Institution or class in the area for any of its disabled men to be trained as might be thought best by them.(8)     Mr. Hobhouse, on taking the Chair, said that this important Conference of Local Authorities was called at the request of the Ministry of Pensions to consider the establish-mftnt of a training centre or centres for disabled soldiers and sail9rs in the West of England.     He felt sure that they would all be convinced of the desirability of endeavouring to teach the disabled men some skilled trade and thus to make them self-supporting, not only during, but after the war.     It was also most important that such centres should be established in places where proper hospital treatment could be provided at the same time;   they could be best established by the co-operation of several Counties and large towns, and Bristol was obviously the most convenient centre in the West of England.     The meeting had been called at the Merchant Venturers&apos; College because the Government had appealed to all the large technical institutions of the country to establish classes.     The Conference was not committed to any particular scheme, and any local authority would be free to submit proposals.(9)     Sir Arthur Boscawen, on/behalf of the Ministry,pointed out that one of the difficulties in inducing men totrain had been a fear lest their pensions should be reducedon account of the resulting earning capacity;    the new Warrant,however, provided for a flat rate for permanent pensions whichwould
/would be determined solely on consideration by a Medical Board of the extent of the manfs physical inc apacity.     Adequate provision would also be made for the men while undergoing training and treatment and it would be possible to exercise penal powers in cases where a man deliberately refused to under-go the necessary treatment; for such a man might forfeit a portion of his pension not exceeding half of the sum awarded,Training would be encouraged by giving the man a bonus, if he agreed to train.The great demand for labour at present made it possible for disabled men to get work with good pay and many were refusing to train because they did not realise that their employment was temporary and that, without training, it would be difficult for them to earn anything like what they now got when the men, now serving with the Forces, returned.The Ministry wished the work of training and treatment to be carried out by Bodies representing considerable areas; no one County or City could itself provide all the training and treatment needed; a Joint Body ought, therefore, to be formed to organise this work.     It was hopefi that all the Local Committees would come in and assist each other,In -arranging this Conference the wishes of the Ministry had been anticipated and they were ready to help the wofek which it was proposed to undertake in every possible way.(10)     Major Mitchell spoke of the experience of thoseLondon Institutions which had been engaged in training dis-abled men; he said that three months was the mimtlmum periodfor training, that only from 2 to 3% of those trained failedto get well remunerated work and/ he believed, permanentsituations
.4- &apos; 157situations.     The period of training in the case of bootmakers was not less than 9 to 12 months but men could be taught to repair boots in 6 months.Under the Warrant the men would get something worth about 32s. 6. a week in addition to allowances for their dependants *(11)    Sir Charles Nicholson said that of the men provided with artificial limbs at Roehampton 40% went back to their pre-war work; of the remainder about half were married and therefore, required training for y/ork which they could do near their homes.the unmarried men were willing to go anywhere.In London it had been found useful to form a Panel for each trade consisting of representatives of employers and workmen; a Committee drawn from the Panel sa?; the men and decided whether their disablement made them unfit for the trade in question.     A man approved by the Committee was sent for training to a Technical Institution; the Committee supervised his&apos; training and were usually able to find him a job at the end;   they also settled the amount of pay which he was to receive.The difficulty of getting at the men might be dealt with by appointing ladies who would act a3 honorary Hospitals Almoners and would help in inducing the men to undergo the training and treatment necessary to make them able to earn adequate wages when peace came.(12)     A number of questions were put to the representatives of the Ministry of Pensions and interesting replies were given.(13)     It was unanimously resolved to recommend to the WarPensions Committees whose members were present that a JointExecutive
m    5    -Executive Committee for training and treatment should he formed and that this Committee should consist of the Chairman (the Right Hon. Henry Hobhouse), one representative.to be appointed by each of the following Yiar Pensions Committees, vizs-Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Dorset, Gloucester (City), Gloucestershire, Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire, with Professor -Verthemier as Honorary Secretary; also that Berkshire and Pleading would bo welcomed, if they decided to join.(1.4)     Dr.&apos; WertLeimer was requested to ask that nominations should be sent to him before Easter and to convene a meeting of the Executive Committee in the second week of April.(15)     He was also authorised to invite to this meeting (as advisory members) the Principals of the larger Technical Institutions in those areas which decided to nominate members of the Joint Committee.(16)     The Chairman, on behalf of the Conference, thanked the representatives of the Ministry cordially for their attendance and the valuable information they had given. Read and approved,HENRY IIOBIIOUSE. Chairman.
APPENDIX. VI. STATEMENT AS TO OVERTIME IN MINISTRY OF PENSIONS.Instructions wore communicated to all Branches in February last that overtime, especially for the female staff, should be reduced.Practically the whole, female staff of the Uinistry now get away at 1 or 1-30 on Saturdays, and arrangements have been made for releasing at the same time as many of the male staff as practicable.A scheme for a 44 hour week for the whole of the temporary staff is under consideration.     This will have the effect of easing to some extent the pressure on the male staff.I. Administration, Officers&apos; Award &amp; Seaman&apos;s Award _Branches.__;__In the Administration Branch overtime has practically ceased except for emergency in the Registry and Typing Sections.The overtime is heaviest in the Officers&apos; Award Branch and the Seamen&apos;s Award Branch.     These Branches are very small and it is difficult to avoid extra work at times as it comes in rushes after a big engagement.     However, arrangements have now been made for additional staff in both Branches, and though it will-be necessary for the male staff to work at times at considerable pressure for long hours, the work of the female staff will, as a rule, be confined to office hours.II. Soldiers Award Branch.The overtime worked in the week prior to the 15th February wasHoursClerical Staff (Men) 559&quot; &quot;       (Women) 2063The
The overtime worked during the week ended 19th March was&apos;-160HoursClerical Staff (Men) 559&quot; &quot;       (Women) 51It is not probable that the low figure of extra duty for the week ended 19th March can be adhered to owing to the additional work in connection with the revision of pensions due to the new Warrant.     Apart;! from this revision while every effort will be made to keep down.overtime it will be inevitable at times owing to the fluctuation in the number of discharged -soldiers.III.     Widows and Dependants of Soldiers and Sailors Award Branch.The rule of the branch is that overtime is not allowed unless absolutely necessary either through fluctuations in the volume of work, the flow of which depends on casualties, sickness of the staff or other special causes.     (The coming re-assessment-of dependants&apos; pensions will j probably necessitate a good deal of overtime work).In the last week before 15th February 1917, 360 worked no overtime j at all and were all given a half holiday on Saturdays. 103, of whom-81 were paid and 08 received no payment, did overtime work during the week of 1 to 3 hours a day. These did not get a Saturday half holiday: The 22 are all supervisors.In the week ended 29th March 1917, 387 worked no overtime.     122,o: whom 98- were paid and 24 received no payment, worked overtime in this week.   (Increased numbers due to the Navy work).The average overtime worked is 1-g- hours a day.In an Office whose work depends on casualties it is not possible t do entirely without overtime v/ork, because if sufficient Staff were takcn to deal with the maximum intake there would often be periods when-considerable numbers would be very slack, and this is very undesirable. As far as possible temporary transfers are made from Section to Section&apos;.: V: - ; -yWr^&apos; &apos;-&quot;&quot;/&apos;V&quot; i&apos; v &apos;prevent undue overtime in any part of tho Office, but the difficulty cannot b . wholly removed in this way.     This matter is being constant! watched and overtime stopped wherever possible.     Nearly all overtime   ;j is voluntarily performed, whether paid or unpaid.&apos; &quot;... -
IV.     Soldiers, Sailors, widows and Dependants Issue Branch.As regards overtime all possible steps are taken to keep..it as-low as possible by taking on fresh staff as quickly as they can be obtained.For the week ended the 14th February the overtime worked was&quot; 588 hours.     For the week ended the 21st March the total amount worked was 192 hours only, which, for a staff of nearly 1200 is very low.     This week it is feared there will be a temporary increase owing to the fact that all Navy pensions must be got out for payment on the 4th April.
