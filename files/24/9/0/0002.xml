The Executive machinery by which Substitution Is to be carried out in future was laid down.IV      AGRICULTURAL SECTION.1.     Military Labour.     Reports from the Sub-Commiss-ioners show that the number of ploughmen released from the Army both in England and Wales has been sufficient to meet the demands of the Farmers.The number of men actually supplied by the Army and placed In situations in England is not known, but in Scotland it amounts to 1,332, the great majority of whom are skilled ploughmen: the remainder have skill in general farm work.     Some wholly unskilled men are employed in Manure Works Other Labour^     In addition to the labour received from the Army, various Corporations and private em-ployers have lent numbers of their servants who have skill in Agriculture for a period of 6 weeks or 2 months.     Many of those are at work now. The number offered in Scotland is 273, and in England, roughly, about the same figure.     It is
el--ar, however, that this aid from Local Authorities and private employers will he of more advantage when the Military Labour is withdrawn, and, accordingly, it has been suggested to many of the Corporations who are still sending in offers of help that they should make their men available towards the end of April.     This request has in most instances been readily acceded to.Tractor Drivers.     There are further requests from Scotland for Tractor Drivers where ploughing by their means is now going on, in several instances, night and day.     These demands have been supplied. Boy Labour.     The Director -of th^.Jlgrdo\iltur-al-^Se-ction ha3 been actively engaged in consultation with the Cavendish Association and the Headmasters of Public Schools in England and Scotland in considering the use to be made of Boy Labour during the current year. A very large number of boys between the ages of fifteen and eighteen, who could render great service to agriculture, would seem to be available.They cannot be employed under the terms of the national Service Scheme because they are under the age of 18.The Director-General and tiio Director of this Section had an interview with the President of the ...  .1 Board of Education and it was ascertained that no objection would be taken to arranging the holidays of the schools so as to suit the necessities of the - farmers.It has been arranged to hold a conference on Tuesday next to whicn representatives have been invited
fr-orn the Public Sdhools of England and Scotland, the Secondary Schools, the Elementary Schools, the Boy Scouts, various Cadet Corps, and from the Civil Service.      It is hoped at that Con-ference to arrive at a definite scheme for util-ising this valuable source of energy, and it is. confidently believed that from the end of April onwards, the country need never be without a considerable supply of Juvenile Labour for agriculture.The Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners for England.
