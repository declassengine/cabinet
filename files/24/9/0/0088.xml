EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMSITTS (SCOILIDED) .I. As in England, two main lines of advanceare indicated both as desirable in themselves and as being&quot;- * in conformity with the general trend of public opinion; These are (1) an improvement in the status and remuneration of teachers generally, but particularly, of teachers in Secondary Schools;    (2) the establishment under suitable conditions of a system of compulsory part-time instruction for young people who; have gone to work on reaching &apos; the age at which school attendance ceases, to be obligatory.    To these may be added a third measure, for which opinion- in Scotland is probably riper than it is in England, viz:- the establishment of some sort of machinery for the more thorough co-ordination of all forms and stages of education, from the primary school to the Universityj  into a harmonious national system whose main function would &quot;be the development in the national interest of ability wherever found.II. Unfortunately in Scotland these questions cannot be dealt with in any effective way without a fundamental reconstruction of the existing educational organization in some important particulars,    (a)   The unit area of local educational administration is still as in 1872 the parish or burgh, and that area has been proved by experience to be altogether inadequate for the organization of an effective system of either secondaryor technical education.      (b)   The Voluntary Schoolst&apos;i. e.; in Scotland mainly- the,Roman Catholic Schools) stillstand outside the national &quot;system.     They are not subject
in any way to the control of the local education authorities, have no support from the local rates, and the children who attend them (one-seventh of the school population of Scotland) are &quot;being deprived of their birth-right of equal educational opportunity.     These are matters which must be put right as a tondition of any further advance, and particularly as a preliminary to any sound reform of the existing system of grants which is now a tangle of relics of former systems, and has little relation to the real necessities of the case.     There is now a growing demand that both these matters - the enlargement of the area of administration for educational purposes and the relation of the Voluntary Schools to the local authority - should be dealt with by legislation,; Without legislation on these points purely administrative action can effect little or nothing,.     On the other hand,  I cannot profess that- any general measure of agreement has yet been reached.In these circumstances,  I think the most convenient&apos;course would be to embody the main points of my programme in a bill.     The introduction and printing of the bill would soirveto focus discussion in Scotland on essential points and so disclose the general trend of public opinion,     The bill itself would be proceeded with later.111*    SuOh a bill would deal with the following main points;1*     The enlargement, of School Board areas.2i     The transference of the Voluntary Schools to the School Boards, as sole managersj on conditions as to the kind of teachers, to be appointed and as to the nature of the religious instruction to be given.
3.     The&apos; imposition of an obligation, upon school Boards to make the provision for the education of.adolescents which Section 10 of the Act of 1908 enables them to do, and to exercise the power of compelling attendance at these classes conferred upon them by the same section.      It is recognised that the establishment of such classes can only be proceeded with gradually as teachers and buildings become available, and there must be power to sanction reasonable delays in bringing the full scheme into operation&apos;.4.     The settlement of the question of the amount and manner in which provision is to be made from State funds for the support of education in Scotland as proposed in clause 14 of the Finance Act, 1914.     That clause, which was subsequently withdrawn for Parliamentary reasons, proposed that there should be put into the Education (Scotland) Fund the equivalent of all State monies receivable at a certain date for the promotion of educa-tion in Scotland, whether from the Vote, local taxation monies or otherwise, together with eleven-eightieths of all new monies granted since that date for the promotion of education in England..     This consolidation, in one fund of the monies available for education in Scotland is a necessary first step toward any satisfactory reconstruction of the system of grant&amp; to local authorities.     From this fund grants will be made to local authorities in aid of their expenditure op Education in accordance with minutesof/
of the Department laid before Parliament.     In framing, these minutes it would be of.advantage to the Department to have some ready-means of ascertaining the views and aspirations of local authorities, and for that reason alone it is matter for consideration whether it would not be expedient to.5.     Constitute a Council, advisory or consultative, to the Department, which Council would be composed of representatives of local education authorities with or without added members representative of the varaed interests concerned in educational administration.     Tp:such a body, if formed,, might, be referred for consideration and report the question of suitable scales of salaries for teachers according to their qualifications and duties, the payment. -of which might be made by the Department a condition precedent to the making of any grant.from the Education (Scotland) Pund to any local authority..It would also be a. suitable body for the investigation,  through&apos; Sub-Committees,  of the many difficult questions which.will arise in. connection with the, institution and working of. Day Continuation Classes for the further instruction of. young people who have reached the school leaving age,     And if it contains representa-tives of the Universities and other centres of higher education&quot; on the one hand,  and;of teachers of both Secondary&apos;and-primary School, on the other,  it might facilitate a better understanding.of the respective spheres, of.these institutions and. more purposeful co-operation b e t we en:- - them . t o a c Ommo n -end .     But it seems essential,. - that/
that the functions of any such body should be advisory or consultative only and should in no way interfere with the responsibility of the Minister to parliament for his administrative acts.IV.    I accordingly desire.(l) sanction to proceed with the preparation of a hill upon those lines,  (2) an assurance that, pending the legislative enactment of the provisions relat ing to the&apos;&apos; const itut ion and appl ic at ion o f &apos; the Education (-Scotland) Eund,  the principle Of the clause will be given effect to by the Treasury to the extent that there will be put into the present-&quot;(restricted) Education Eund eleven-eightieths of any additional grants that may be given to England for,purposes-&apos;of education.The existing Education (Scotland) Eund has of late years proved to be more&quot;and more Inadequate to the charges placed - upon..it, and such .an&quot;accession to the Eund will be welcome,, not only as-/enabling better ^provision of bursaries for secondary education- to he :&apos;made&apos;;in &quot;several districts where, they -are badly needed-, hut also as placing Managers in a -position:-to.-, offer better salaries to their teachers,
