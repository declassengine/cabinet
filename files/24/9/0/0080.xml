Report for Period from the 51st March to 6th*T Apro!L&quot;l917.1.        The Royal Warrant of the 29th March 1917 for the Pensions of soldiers disabled and of the families and dependants of soldiers deceased in consequence of the present war and the corresponding Order in Council of the same date relating to Seamen and Marines came into force on the 4th instant, by which date all permanent pensions to disabled soldiers and sailors had been re-assessed.widowsAs regards/all authorities sent to the Pension Issue Office since tho 14th March, have stated the rate payable from the 4th April (as well as the old rate). On the 14th March there were approximately 67,000 cases to be re-assessed.   Of these about 6500 were Wavy widows, and the re-assessment was- made at the Tate Gallery before the cards were sent to the Pension Issue Office.   This left about 61,000 to be dealt with by the Pension Issue Office.   10,000 have already been re-assessed and new draft books issued; 20,000 have been re-assessod and ready for issue with new draft books, the rest will be completed in about two months1 time.Dependants&apos; cases are more,difficult to deal with, and the re-assessment of tho 75,000 cases involved can scarcely be completed in less than 6 months.   A good deal of preliminary work has had to be done and new forms printed in this connection, but all Is now ready and the work 6f re-assessing has seriously commenced.   All pension authorities sent to Pension Issue Office as from the 4th April will give the new rates, up to that date old rates were givon.
The Instructions for the assessment of&quot;&quot; minimum pensions both as regards soldiers and sailors and widows and dependants which-have been drawn up by a Committee of the Ministry though not finally approved are in a form enabling assessments to be made.   The Regulations and Instructions dealing with alternative pensions drawn up by a Subcommittee of the Statutory Committee have been generally agreed with them and will, it is hopod., ba ready for issue shortly after Easter.   Certain points with regard to the Regulations and Instructions as to allowances etc., in connection with treatment and training still remain to be settled.2,        The constitution and procedure of the independent tribunal proposed to be sot up to review decisions as to whether men should get pensions for injuries a? disease attributable to or aggravated by military sorvice or gratuities for Injuries neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service were under consideration during the week.3.        The Naval and Military War Pensions (Adminiatrative Sxpenses) Bill was brought, up t.o the Lords in the form shown in Appendix I hereto and passed its second reading without discussion on the 3rd instant.   The Committee Stage of the Bill has, however, boon deferred until the second sitting day after the recess at Easter to enable certain further amendments to be considered. Among those is an important one providing that District Committcos shall be set up within the-County of London fpr each Metropolitan Borough within six months after&apos;.&quot;-Vthe termination of the War &quot;provided that the Minister
of Pensions shall he satisfied that arrangements are made so that the exisiting organisation of the Local Committee for London is not unduly disturbed&apos;1.   The Clause in this form has been agreed between representatives of the Metropolitan Boroughs and the London War Pensions Committee and was accepted by the London County Council at a Meeting of their General Purposes Committee on tho 2nd instant.   The Minister had, in the course of proceedings on the Bill in the House of Commons, indicated that he was prepared to accept an agreed amendmont which would meet the object which the Metropolitan Boroughs had in view.4.      The Bill to amend the enactments relating to National Health Insurance with reference to persons suffering from disablement in consequence of the present war, referred, to in paragraph 4 of last weekrs report was introduced in the form shown in Appendix II hereto on the 3rd instant, and read a secona time without a division. The explanation given of the second Clause of the Bill was not very complete.   The Clause is really intended to substitute a gratuity for sickness benefit when a gratuity has already been substituted for pension in Neurasthenic cases in which it is believed by leading Medical Authorities that dependence on unearned weekly payments tend to prevent the exertion of effort and therefore to delay cure.   Mr. Hogge who spoke on the matter assumed that an additional gratuity of  6.10.0. would be paid in all cases where no pension was awarded to a man who had been a soldier.5. .    A Report of the Statutory Committee giving details of the work done and of the reports received by them during the week is annexed as Appendix III.The
The local Committee for- Dublin City at. last tool: uptheir Statutory duties on the 2nd instant.   A separatelocal Committee has been formed for the borough of Glossop.and commenced duty on the 26th ultimo.Satisfactory reports have beon received of theworking of the local Committees of Portsmouth where661 cases have been dealt with since January 1st, ofWest Ilartlepool where the establishment of a convalescenthome for men in training has been mooted, and of County ofCarlow and/Ipswich where the problem of dealing with disabled men appears to be of small dimensions.   The Coventry and Nuneaton Committees are stated to be neglecting their duties.   The facilitf-with which men get good employment is emphasised in reports from Rawtenstall, Portsmouth, Ipswich, Bury and Nottingham. Difficulties still present themselves in dealing with Class W mon as instanced in reports from Nuneatfcn, Nottingham and Bury,.   New training schemes have been submitted for approval by the Bristol and Kent Local Committees.6.       Paragraph 8&apos; of the Report for the Period from the 10th to the 16th March stated that tho organisation for giving discharged and disabled men out-patient treatment without any delay on their return to their homes was receiving the consideration of the Ministry and the Statutory Committee.    A circular, a c&amp;py of which forms Appendix IV to this Report, has now been prepared by these Departments in consultation and issued to local Committees.   It enjoins on these the necessity for appointing visitors at every Hospital tp . serve as a means of communication between a man and thelocal
local Committee of the district where he is going toreside and it sets forth the subsequent arrangementsthethat should be made for/man&apos;s treatment and training. The conditions of the new Royal Warrant as regards allowances, fees and penalties in. this connection are given in the circular,It will be remembered that the Royal Warrant imposes penalties on men who refuse treatment and seeks by pecuniary, rewards to induce them to undergo training,     A well written letter from a disabled sergeant at the military hospital at Brighton, who is awaiting the fitting of an artificial limb, has been received, which sets forth clearly the advantages likely to be derived by men from re-education.     This  letter has been printed and will be distributed to disabled men in all the hospitals in the country and a copy is annexed as A&quot;-^endix Y,7. I&quot;-&quot;1 Paragraph 7 cf the Report for the Period from the7th to the 23rd March, reference was made to a general scheme ol the Ministry of Pensions to divide the United Kingdom into some 20 districts for the purpose of best utilising the resources of the country for the training of disabled men.     Further steps were taken during the week in this direction by the holding of five Conferences presided over by Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawe at the Ministry on the 3rd and 4th instants with represen. tatives of the following counties(1) Kent, Surrey and Sussex.(2) Mi-odlesex and Herts.(3) Essex, Cambridge, Suffolk, Norfolk.(4) Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Oxfordshire,(5) Berkshire and Hertfordshire. -  -It was generally agreed at these Conferences that larger meetings should be held at which Joint Committeesshould

Appendix VI gives the classification of the disabilities for which Warrant Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and men Yrtio had been discharged from the Army since the commencement of the war up to the 31st March 1917.It shows that in 7,268 cases (including frostbites) there had been amputations of legs, arms, feet or hands. Up to the same date 8,187 artificial limbs had been supplied or were on order, making an increase of 642 during the month, a number of these having been furnished to men not yet discharged.   5,914 undischarged men had had limbs amputated but had not yet been fitted with artificial limbs.   950 were ready to be so fitted at Roehampton.The following numbers of men were admitted to the various limb fitting Hospitals or discharged from them fitted with limbs during March:-Name of Hospital.      Number Admitted. Number Discharged.Roehampton.Princess Louise1s Cottage Hospital.Ulster Volunteer Forces Hospital.Princess Patricia1s Hospital, Bray:.Eton Hall Hostel, Kelso.Total.
In consequence of the press of work at Chelsea resulting from the new Royal Warrant, the Minister of Pensions decided to relieve the Award to Soldiers Branch of the duty of looking after the supply of artificial limbs now undertaken by the Ministry for all soldiers whether discharged or not.   The Section of the office engaged in this work has been placed under the charge of Sir Alexander Diack, K.C.T.E. C.V.O. formerly Commissioner of the Punjab and recently employed in the Ministry of Munitions.   Sir Alexander Diack will represent the Ministry on Sir Charles Parsons1 Committee for the Standardisation of Artificial Limbs and on the Joint Committee which has been formed of representatives from the Roehampton Committee and tho St, John Ambulance Association to consider the question of repairs to artificial limbs in cases which do not require re-admission to limbless hospitals.Sir Alexander will have under him an Inspector of artificial limbs and a small staff.   The question of transferring to this staff the staff now located at St. Stephen&apos;s House, which keeps up a Central Registry of limbless men vrith a view to arranging for their admission to tho fitting hospitals, is under consideration, as well as the creation of a corresponding registry for Orthopaedic cases and for cases requiring various forms of Institutional Treatment.9.     A Conference was held by Mr. Barnes and Sir ArthurGriffith-Boscawen on the evening of the 3rd instant withKing Manool,- Sir Walter Lawrence, Sir Alfred- Koogh andMr. Cyril Jackson on the subject of centres forOrthopaedic treatment.   Whereas in ordinary cases mendischarged firom Hospital had better go to their homesor to the houses of relatives for out-patient ttsr.eatmeritat
&apos;at the -nearest coirrenlent mlli-tary-*or-^ivll-^spl*al4    3 2 f it is essential that in Orthopaedic cases they should receive all such treatment at an Orthopaedic Hospital, preferably at the one in which they had been in-patients. It was represented by Sir Walter Lawrence that the matter\ was very pressing in view of the fact that a considerable number of men were about to be discharged from Shepherds Bush (180), Alder Hey and the other 10 Hospitals of t$i^, class. The arrangements that had been organised for notifying local Committees of the places where the men intended to reside would not apply to these cases.   They should be-dealt with centrally and distributed to the Orthopaedic Hospitals according to the capacity of theso for out-patient treatment and the extent to which this capacity had already been drawn upon.     This would involve the provision of hostels or the billeting of men in the neighbourhood of the hospitals.   For the general organisation of the arrangements Sir Walter Lawrence strongly advised the establishment of a central registry on the lines of the one referred to in the preceding paragraph.As this would involve delay in dealing with men shortly to be discharged, the Statutory Committee were asked to send a communication to the Local Committees of the places where there are Orthopaedic centres , asking them to pay special attention to these men.At a subsequent consultation with Sir Walter Lawrence and Col. Robert Jones, the necessity for re-inforcing the staff of surgeons at these centres was emphasized as well as the largo number of cases probably as many as 10% now in general Hospitals which should properly be receiving Orthopaedic treatment.   Altogether since the commencement of the war there have been some 30,000 cases of wounds and injuries to limbs notinvolving
:    32?^Jirolving-ampul^^ p^portiotr afTyfalxto&apos;should properly have treatment of this class.A list of the Orthopaedic centres with tip number of bedd available in them is annexed as Appendix VII to this Report.   Enquiries arc, being made as to the number of cases which could be given out-patient treatment, at each of those centres. 10.      During March 25 men were admitted to the Blindod . Soldiers1 and Sailors1 Hostel, St. Dunstitjif0. Regent1 s Park, and 9 men were discharged from the commencement of the war to the end of the month, the number admitted was 551 of whom 218 had passed through.   Of this number 181 had been fully trained and set up for themselves, the remaining 37 owing to mental or physical disability had left without boing so sot up.   On tho 1st April 333 men were in St. DunstanTs or Its various annexes. 100 blind cases were still in Hospitals at different plaoos waiting till they were ready to be sent to St. Dunstan&apos;s. &quot;11.   , Table I shows that 10^16 pensions including childrenrs allowances were granted during the week against 9,501 during the previous week and 8,944 in the week before that.   From the commencement of the war up to the 4th April of 5,577, 300 pensions including children&apos;s allowances had been awarded.Table. II shows that during the last week 219 grants of supplementary pensions and temporary allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 210 in the previous week and that the total number to date is 3063. 12.     The Staff of the Ministrynot including that of the Statutory Committee has boon increased by G8 during the week and now consists of 197 men and 2^.501 women or2,698
2696 in all, the addition being distributed among the women clerks in the Award to Soldiers, Award to Widows and Pension Issue Branches.In view of the very heavy work which will be involved by the grant of gratuities in the non-attributable and non-aggravated cases to which pensions have hitherto been refused, a further increase of 200 women to the Award to Soldiers Branch at Chelsea has been sanctioned.The staff of the Statutory Committee, has also been increased to meet the work which will fall on them in consequence of the new Warrant and now consists of 72 men and 162 women, 234 in all, bringing up the grand total to 2,982.The daily absence.owing to the measles epidemic in the female staff at Tate Gallery has increased during the week from 11*4 to 13*2 per cent.   The absence percentage at Chelsea has gone down from 7*8 to 6*6 and that of the Pensions Issue Office is still 7*9.M.N.6th April 1917.

Up to the present no. discharged soldiers and sailors have required treatment, in hosnital, two out of the 18 on the Register have obtained employment on the land and the Committee are at their next meeting to take into consideration the subject of training men so as to permit of their getting work.Our Inspector reporting cn *7est Hartlepool Local Committee states that the Committee are very enthusiastic about their work and he believes would be willing to raise- a certain amount of money to assist the scheme regarding the training of disabled men in Convalescent Homes.Reporting on Coventry Local Committee, our Inspector states that with regard to discharged disabled soldiers and sailors, the Committee have taken no steps what-ever to deal with this matter.     He was informed that the Committee felt there was no use in doing so as every man commenced to work the moment.he got to Coventry.    Of ,289 men on the Register, all are at work with the. exception of 25w
33(JfJOur Inspector reporting on $uneaton Local Committee states with regard to discharged disabled soldiers and sailors that their neglect in this matter is very grave,, and the Inspector announced his intention of wishing to speak plainly to the Committee on the subject.&apos;   There are no voluntary workers, there is no link between the home&apos;, the office and tho Committee.     Everything is done with most formal routine.With regard to the treatment of men transferred to Class 17. Reserve, he states that there are men in Huneaton who have been badly wounded and who are altogether unfit for work.     Their pay is stopped and they are in a most wretched plighto     He urges the Statutory Committee^ activity in the interests of these men.Extract from letter from the Secretary of luton Local Committee&quot;In the opinion of the Committee it is very un-desirable that men who have contracted disabilities through their Army Service and have become unfit should be retained in the Army,     The- Committee consider that when a men becomes unfit for service, his case should be dealt ;vith and he should be discharged with such a pension as may be reasonable according to the extent of his disability&quot;.Our Inspector reporting on Rawtehstall Local Committee states that emp^nnent is found here without difficulty.   &apos; One of the most important local industries is slipper manufacture and light employment can easily be secured for partially disabled men.Our Inspector reporting on Portsmough Local Committee states that prior to the 1st January, of the
men in respect of whom discharge notices had been received only those who nad served abroad had been visited.     Since that date all such men have been and are visited.    It is reported that the demand for labour exceeds the supply and it is estimated that only 3$ of the cases coming before the Committee will require special training.       The majority of the men appear to obtain employment in the Dockyards. The Committee is now training seven men as follows:-1 Chauffeur, 1 clerical work, 3 munition works and 2 technical training,      The local Boot   Traders Association is considering a scheme for the training and employment of 200 men in boot repairing.&apos;     There is in existence a County Red Cross Scheme for the treatment of paralysed rnerLThe organisation and administration are very good, the Office is open all day.     Oases arc investigated in the several districts by visitors.,     Full particulars are kept of each case dealt with and ths sub-heads of the Regulations are shown in each case.     651 cases have been dealt with from the 1st January and the   Committee seems to be fully in touch with the &quot;various bodies and individuals iron when necessary information can be obtained.Our Inspector at Ipswich states that there are not many cases of disablement which have been dealt with lately. Those that havo cone before the Committee have been adequately arranged for and work has been found for the men such as they required in nearly every case.     There have boon no applications for Educational Grants.Extracts from a letter from the   Secretary of the Local Committoo at Nottingham:-&quot;I may say that wo are having applications from
men transferred to Glass 17. or 7 (T) Reserve for assistance and it is difficult to know what is to &quot;be done in these cases,     These men allege that although relegated to Class W. they are unable to find work because they can only take the place of a man who is released for Field Service&quot;.Our- Inspector reporting on Bury Local Committee states that generally the work is thoroughly done and the Regulations are carried out.     Bury is fortunate in having a great variety of trades and the question of employment has not so far presented anjr serious difficulty.It is reported that the Army   Pay and   Allowances to men in Class W. Reserve for one week is not actually given but credited to the man1s account;     This is not satisfactory as cash is required.DISABEEMMS BRAIICE.Training and Employment Section.1.

Circular No. 35. Appendix IVLocal Committees.War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee,   .22, Abingdon Street,London, S.W. 1,5th April, 1917.HOSPITAL VISITOES.Sir,I am directed by the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee to state that a letter has been received from the War Office from.which it appears that under the great pressure on Military Hospitals which is now foreseen they fear that it will not be possible for them to retain discharged soldiers in Military Hospitals for so long a period as that contemplated by paragraph 2 of the Army Council Instruction No. 449 of 1917. Hence it is all the more important that Local Committees should be in a position to arrange for out-patient treatment for soldiers discharged from hospital.It will be observed from the Articles of the new Royal Warrant which are printed as Appendix I to this Circular that the State will now provide liberally for the expen-diture necessary in connection with the treatment and training of disabled men, penalising severely the man who declines treatment and rewarding him who undergoes training. Moreover, the Army Council Instruction shows that the War Office are willing to make arrangements to the full extent of their resources to assist Local Committees in securing out-patient treatment for discharged men.   A copy of theInstruction is enclosed.2. The first thing is for Local Committees to appoint the duly accredited repre-sentatives referred to in the 5th paragraph of the Instruction to visit and confer with the authorities of Military Hospitals and the men about to be discharged. One such representative will be required by each large hospital or group of small hospitals in the Committee&apos;s area. It is stated in the 9th paragraph of the Instruction that the Deputy Director of Medical Service will furnish each Local Committee with a list of the Military Hospitals. In any case in which this has not already been done immediate application should be made to him, and if by mischance the list for any area is still not forthcoming a report should be sent to the Statutory Committee. To assist Local Committees who may be unaware of the Command in which their area is, included, a list is given in Appendix II hereto.3. It will be observed that though appointed by and representing the Local Com-mittees of the places where the hospitals are situate, the persons referred to above, who may conveniently be termed visitors, will mainly work for the Committees of the places at which the men express their intention of residing. They should be appointed with the concurrence in each case of the hospital authorities. It is understood that the War Office cannot arrange for any member of the staff of a Military Hospital undertaking the duties. Visitors will be needed at the Civil Hospitals, and also at the Auxiliary Hospitals of the Red Cross Society. It is possible that at some Civil Hospitals the work might be carried out by existing almoners, and it may be that there are already working in Auxiliary Hospitals of the Red Cross Society persons who might suitably be appointed. The duties of the visitors will be to help men about to be discharged to get the treatment and training they require, and in some cases employment.TREATMENT.4. Cards (Army Form W. 3555) will be sent by the Officer in Charge of any Military Hospital to Local Committees. A copy of the card is printed on page 3 of the enclosure. The visitors should see these cards, and explain to the men the further treatment, if any, that they will be required to undergo, the arrangements that can be made under the regulations for their advantage while undergoing it, and the penalties which will result if they decline or neglect to avail themselves of it. The visitor should communicate with the Local Committee of the area in which the man proposes to reside with regard to his further treatment in hospital if this is recommended. If, for instance, there is no hospital near the man&apos;s own home, the visitor will find out and inform the Local Committee whether the man is able to go to relations in any place near a Military &apos;0r General Hospital, where the particular form of treatment required can be given, and if not in what town nearest to his home he thinks he can best be billeted.   It will(B 9243)  Wt.      -g 357  7500  4/17  H&amp;S
be for the Local Committee receiving such communication to make the arrangements for the man&apos;s treatment which they consider most in his interest, and to see that heis informed of them.5. In many cases regular treatment will not be necessary, and the man may be fit to go to his own home and return to his former occupation or get new employment. It will generally, however, be well for him that he should continue under medical care. It is therefore desirable that the visitor should ascertain from him whether he is insured, and, if so, that he should impress upon him the importance of corn-plying with the Instructions contained in the Army Form 0. 1845, which he will receive on his discharge. A copy of the Army Form is printed as Appendix III hereto. The man should also be instructed to apply at once on his discharge to the Insurance Committee with a view to his being placed on the list of a panel doctor. The visitor should further ascertain whether there has been any change in the man&apos;s home address since he enlisted and whether the proper address has been communi-cated to the hospital authorities. Otherwise they may give erroneous information to the Local Committee, and thus delay may arise in the services of a panel doctor being obtained.TRAINING.6. In addition to the arrangements to be made for treatment it wiU be desirable that the visitors should also discuss with the men questions relating to their future employment and possibilities of training. They should be advised that though at the present moment the great demand for labour makes it exceedingly easy to obtain immediate employment at high wages, after the war disabled men may be at a disad-vantage compared with the completely able-bodied, and that now is the time for them to enter for courses of training which will give them some additional skill to enable them in the future to compete successfully in the labour market. Each man, there-fore, should be asked whether he has work to which he can go, or whether he is able to return to his old employment. If he has not a promise of re-instatement, or if his former employment was such that it is obvious he will now be unfit for it, or it is of a character which makes it desirable that he should aim at something better, his views as to the future work lor which he is fitted should be obtained, and the visitor should discuss with him the possibilities of training and endeavour to estimate the chances of his being fitted for the occupation which he desires, or place before him other considerations to which, looking to his disability, his attention should be drawn. Thus it may be very useful to a disabled man who is suffering from some disease which requires open air work, and who has previously worked in a factory, to bring before him the advantages of the country. In this connection the new Warrant with its offer of a money reward for completed training should be carefully explained. When the man&apos;s own views have been elicited the visitor should communicate with the Local Committee, who will no doubt endeavour to arrange for training, or if the trade or business into which the man desires to enter is one in which there are not likely to be openings, to give advice as to the main industries in his native place in which there is a probability of their being able to assist him to find employment.7. The duties of the visitors in connection with training and employment will be of real importance, as it must be borne in mind that many of the men will not be in the habit of looking far ahead, and will not have much knowledge of openings in any industry except that to which they are accustomed. In order that the visitors may be as well informed as possible, especially as some of them will no doubt be ladies and will not be familiar with matters affecting employment, it is desirable that the information which is now being collected at the Ministry of Labour, and which, it is hoped, will very shortly be in the hands of Local Committees, should be placed at their disposal.8. I am to ask the Local Committee to take at once the necessary steps to find visitors under this scheme and to report as soon as possible as to the arrangements made to carry it into effect. It is obvious that unless it is carried out universally there will be no equality of treatment for the several men.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,E. A. STANTON, Lieut.-Colonel,Secretary.The Secretary or Clerk to theWar Pensions Local Committee.

Are you trained in any trade or profession?No, then start your training at once! If you are, are you as competent as you were two years ago&apos;, after being so long away from your work?  No, then start retraining at once!The various Training Centres and Workshops attached to many Hospitals, and established in most of the larger towns and cities, are for this purpose.You have the, opportunity of&apos; receiving first-class, tip-top training free of all charge in any of the trades taught Training in the various shops and model offices by instructors cognisant with the ^ery latest and modem appliances now in use. The latest and most up-to-date methods and procedure are adopted throughout the whole of these -institutions. The work done is practical as.well as theoretical; you encounter similar work that you would in ordinary workshops and offices......Arrangements have been made whereby-you may receive instrue-tion at the various technical schools and training centres after your discharge.. Furthermore, should you continue to receive this train -ing after your discharge, under the new warrant you will receive an allowance of 5/- in addition to your pension whilst receiving this instruction. ...1. .. ......       ...   . i-After months of slacking in hospital your body, brain and muscle become very lax, very loose. i..Gould you go. straight from hospital to do eight hours a day-work without feeling. the strain or breaking down ? .     -You can break yourself in.;now-gradually by. becoming used to the.restraint of the office and shop by undergoing training for a few hours a day. .- . .-You will feel the difference; gradually your body will strengthen, your nerves brace up, your health generally.buck up, and you will become a smarter 1 and more business-like man.

Great trade slumps and high prices have always prevailed for some years after all previous wars, and this being the greatest of wars, a proportionate slump and rise in prices must surely follow.Your pension is not meant to live on : it is a pension for services rendered, not a retiring pension.To live on your pension is out of the question; it would be a mere existence.It&apos;s plain you must train, you must&apos;be skilled, to take advantage of the opportunities which are yours by right.Then fit yourself to earn a good wage, a fair salary, and let your pension be real asset to you; let it augment your salary and enable you to live in comparative prosperity.The Superintendents, Instructors and Students will tell you of the opportunities they know are awaiting the trained man. They will give you actual results of men, their own colleagues, who under-went a course of training, became skilled in their trades and pro-fessions, and obtained, and are now in, good salaried positions.Results prove the success of this training.Do you want to be a respectable self-supporting citizen or a lazy good for nothing, depending on charity? Do you want to live comfortably, to have, and to save money, or lead a miserable, grovelling existence?Think, it&apos;s either one or the other. Nothing remains Station-ary; it grows better or deteriorates.As thinking men, you must choose the former of the two illus-trations.Then be prepared, be trained, join to-day before it is too late, and make sure of the prizes of Success, Prosperity and Good Wages, which are now offered to all trained and skilled labour.J.
