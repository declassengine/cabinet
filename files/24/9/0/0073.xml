81^1 WAR CADIEIT.TONNAGE TOR ITALIAN COAL.0opj 0iL2-eygr &apos;f&apos;rom Shipping Gontroller dated 4-4-17.(Circulated for information in connection with War Cabinet 10S, Min. 9. -   See Appendix - )Pear Sir Maurice Eankey,In reply to your letter of March 89th, wo are taking all possible steps to provide tonnage for Italian coal even at the expense of other important services.present . -The/position isthat we have allocated British tonnagewhich should- deliver.in Italy during the present month about200,000 tons of coal in addition to the  05,000 tons forwhich the Italians have made arrangements, making a total forthis month -of&apos; a little over. 400,000 tons.     The British torin-age includes 43,00.0 tons destined for. British MediterraneanNaval Depots...but diverted.to Italy to meet the present emergency.As re gards May arrivals, it is hoped that it may be possible, though only with great difficulty and at the expense of other essential services, to allot Sufficient tonnage  (in addition to making up the 45,000 tons diverted from British I aval Depots) to give Italy a total quantity of 450,000 tons if the -Italians themselves can-provide 800,000 tons as for April and if,  as they estimate, they will have Lin extra 60,000 tons from recently allotted vessels chartered by the Inter-Allied Bureau.     This is in addition to .any help we may get for Italy from France (see below)I do not think we can expect immediate substantial assis-tance for   Italy from the surrender of vessels by the Admiralty and the War Office.     In the course of the last three months the Admiralty has reduced the number of Home Fleet Colliers and the War Office has surrendered a certain number of troop ships and remount ships, but this reduction has been neutral-ieed by (l) additional Admiralty requirements .ln connection with the pursuit of the raider and the submarine campaign and (3). large new War Office demands for cross channel shipments of locomotives trucks etc., and for increased supplies to Salonika and Egypt, and there- is a net increase .since December of 56 in the number of vessels employed on naval and military service.The War Office have agreed to give up shortly a further eight ships (6 troopships and two timber ships), but these will all be absorbed in providing for other Government require-ments (notably the summer White Sea programme) for..which we are very far from being able to provide sufficient tonnage, and they cannot accordingly be treated as a gift to.Italy.We have taken steps, in accordance with the War Cabinet Socision, to give formal notice to the French Government under the Clementel Agreement that the number of British vessels on French Service must be reduced and we are pressing them strongly to give emergency help to. Italy.     We cannot, however, proceed to withdraw vessels from French service pending the reply of the French Government, as they are entitled, under the Clementel Agreement, to have an opportunity of considering, in the event of a reduction being necessary, froiri what services the vessels required should be withdrawn.lours faithfully, ; (Sgd).

.WAH CABIHET 102 (Minute 9)ti, FOR ITALY,9*   The War Cabinet had before thorn reparts &quot;by tho Prosidont of tho Board of Trade (8.1.-147** --Appendix Y) and (Gerf..-21lP - Appendix YI),&apos;as pll as a note by the Shipping Controller (G.T,-1C9^ -Appendix VII), on tho subject of tho Tory grave posi-* tion in regard to the supply of ooal to Italy, which country is. at. present receiving only about 42 p.or cent of her minimum requirements.- Sir Joseph Maclay pointod out that this situation was duo not to any failure on our part, but on. the part of Italy herself,.aggravated, however, by neutral ships not being obtainablo.   He pointed out that we had been passing through tho worst period of tho year from a shipping point of view; tho now arrangements for securing additional tonnage from distant seas had not yet come into operation; and that in tho. event of the intervention in the War of tho United States of America the shipping situation should be considerably relieved by the fact that American ships could bo utilised, and that wheat could then bo obtained and financed in this nearer market0Having regard more particularly to the apprehensions regarding an attack on Italy, referred to in Hinutc 1, and in view of tho fact that Franco is rocoiving 61 per&apos;cent of hor minimum requirements., -compared with Italy&apos;42 per conti the War Cabinet authorised -(The Shipping Controller to divert for a month or so to Italy some of the tonnage at present allotted to France, and to acquaint tho IPrench and Italia Governments., &quot;through its proper channels, of theaction taken0    Already circulated.
