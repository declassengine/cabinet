Any further communication should be fddressed not to any individual by name, but to-The Director, Iboard of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department, 72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. l.^nd should quote the Reference Number and Date of this letter.Registered Telegraphic Address: &quot;Growmore, Sowest, London.&quot; Telephone: Victoria 8240.v Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1.4th April, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to submit the Report of the Food Production Department for the Week ended 3rd AprilThe weather conditions during the past week have been abnormally unfavourable for agricultural work and, in consequence, but little progress has been made with the spring cultivations or the ploughing of additional land,     With regard to the latter District Commissioners have been instructed to furnish, as early, as possible, returns from each County of the acreage already dealt with, and it is hoped that some preliminary figures will be available next week.I,      LOCAL ORGANISATION. Meanwhile, every effort is being made to develop and improve local organisation with a view to the greater campaign for the harvest of 1918, and other pressing problems are being taken in hand.Drainage of Land;Prominent amongst these is the question of Land Drainage.     There are at present in many parts of the country large areas, capable of bearing crops, which cannot be brought into cultivation owing to their water-logged condition.     To make them available for food production requires  the carrying out of drain-ages schemes of various kinds and scales.     As a preliminary and essential step, powers have been given by a Defence of the Realm Regulation, made on the 30th March, to enforce upon occupiers the
1 imaintenance of banks and the cleansing of channels of watercourses..The occupier may be called upan to do the work, and if he does not take steps for that purpose within seven days, the work required can be done for him and the cost recovered.By the same Regulation power has been given to regulate the flow of water in rivers or streams obstructed by mills, dams, sluices, and so on..     The excessive holding up of water by these obstructions has been found to have a serious effect on agriculture, especially in the Eastern Counties.The powers conferred by the above Regulation have been delegated to County Executive Conmitteesj   hut the Boartl have reserved, in the case of impounding of water, a right of appeal to themselves to be exercised within seven days of the service of the Order of the  .Oounty Executive Committee.     This reservation was necessary in order that the interests of the persons controlling the mills and other obstructions might be safeguarded in accordance with the Regulation,Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.The majority of County Executive Committees continue to give directions for the cultivation of additional pieces of land in their area, and to take measures to enforce the directions previously given.     The following are examples of other activities by Executive Committees: -Berkshire - On the recommendation of the Executive Committee the landlord has been authorised to determine the tenancy of Upper Farm, Parnborough, (800 acres).     The farm is being let immediately to a new and energetic tenant,Cheshire - The Committee are taking possession of a farm at Whit^y, and arranging for its cultivation by the owner.
Cornwall - The Executive Committee have been authorised to take possession of Bosparva Farm, Gwinear^ (136 acres), the tenant having no capital to work the farm.     They have sanctioned the acquisition of land for allotments at Redruth, and have acquired land for the&apos;same purpose at Millbrcok.Hampshire - The Executive Committee--are arranging to take possession of a farm at Upper Neatham^ near Alton.     At the instance of the Department the Committee are intervening with regard to a farm near Romsey, of which the tenant had received notice to quit.Kent - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 200 acres of building land near Birchington.     They are taking possession of 50 acres of arable land in Romsey Marsh, and of SO acres at Darenth, and have arranged for the provision of allotments at several centres in the county,Somerset - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 93 acres of agricultural land in the neighbourhood of Yeovil, which had been bought at a speculation and left ovacant since its purchase;    they propose letting the land to neighbouring farmers.Suffolk, West -The Committee are making arrangements for the taking over of farms at Hitcham, Boxford,. Whatford (acreage not stated), and of 330 acres of land at Rattlesden. Carmarthenshire - The Committee have remodelled their organisa-tion and have appointed District Committees, the members cf which have been holding crowded meetings of&quot;farmers throughout the county.     Sanction has been given to acquire land for allotments in Carmarthen, Llanelly , and Burry Port; other lands are being inspected for the same purpose. Radnorshire - The Committee have been authorised tc take possession of a farm of 140 acres and other pieces of land (32 acres) near Rhayader, and of two, fields at Glasbury.
Credit to Farmers i Several of the Committees, notably those .In Oxfordshire and West Sussex, have received and dealt with applications from farmers for credit under the system recently introduced with the co-operaticn of the Banks.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (Nq.2).Particulars received from 659 Boroughs or Urban Districts show that:-96,429 applications for plots have been made;    and 75,671 plots have been provided, containing an area of about 5,330 acres.The Local Authorities, which, generally speaking, are alive to the needs of the present time, display activities of various kinds.     For instance, Abergavenny Borough received only 14 applications for plots under the Order, but they have, instituted a scheme under which the Council Schools are tending 20 acres of p^tatces, each scholar having an interest in the crop.Horticultural Section.The letters sent by the Department urging that additional land should be cultivated by the staff and patients of Hospitals, Workhouses, Asylums, etc., are meeting with a satisfactory response.    During the week reports have been received that over 300 additional acres will be cultivated this year.     341 expert advisers have been supplied by the Department.As a result of a donation of  300 given to the Food Production Department by Mr. J. W. Arkwright, Village Food Production Societies have been established or are in course of establishment in every village in Herefordshire.
Feeding Stuffs.   The Sub-Committee, has given further consideration to the questions of making the most effective use of the probable supplies of feeding stuffs and of ensuring publicity for their recommendations.     Arrangements are being made for the preparation of leaflets dealing with the feeding of the different classes of stock.     Notes on the use of linseed oil for calf feeding and on the use of surplus brewers&apos; yeast for stock feeding have been prepared.Crass Land.       A leaflet advocating the conversion of poor hill grass land in parts of Wales and Devon into rape pasture has been prepared and sent to the printer.     This will be of great help on upland grass farms In many parts of Wales.Crops .     The Sub-Committee has suggested various measures to meet possible difficulties which farmers may experience during the next few months.     The following cases were considered:- (1) Partial failure of autumn sown wheat;    (2) Inateillty-^^cw^pri^..c^nit:crops at the usual time;   (3) Failure - ofhA-s^n^ingns^v^^ to attacks of wire worm;   (4) Inability -to- .ST^-mangel-s^j3wedes or turnips in the ordinary way owing- -to lack of&quot;&apos;aahour-f^r^ing3jLng &apos; and weeding, and (5) A shortage of cabbage plants.     A leaflet dealing with these points has been prepared.III. LABOUR.Soldier Labour.     Returns received from Executive Committees show that 26,929 soldiers had been applied for by farmers up to the 31st March, including ploughmen, men of the Home Defence Force, and Agricultural Companies.     In addition, a large number of application for men by name have been granted by Commanding Officers, so that the number of soldiers now at work approximates to 30,000.     Of this number about 5,000 belong to the Agricultural Companies, including
some 500 employed in Artificial Manure Works.It was originally arranged that the skilled men and the men of the Home Defence Force would be available for agri-cultural work until 15th April;   the Adjutant-General has now agreed that they shall not be recalled before the end of the month.The War Office have issued orders to commands that all skilled shepherds applied for should be released if they can be spared, and the War Agricultural Committees have been informed.At a conference held during the week the War Office accepted the suggestion outlined in last week&apos;s Beporti and it was decided that men in the Royal Defence Corps who have previous agri-cultural experience should be exchanged for men in Agricultural Companies who do not possess such experience, in so far as men physically fit-for the duties of the Royal Defence Corps can be provided from these Agricultural Companies.     Consequent on these arrangements, orders are being issued by the War Office to ascertain the number of skilled agriculturists in the Royal Defence Corps.Prisoners of War.   At the same conference It was decided that guards for the civilian prisoners of war to be employed in agri-. culture, may, subject to certain conditions, be drawn from Agri-cultural Companies.     It is also being suggested to the War Office? that the Royal Defence Corps should be brought up to its full strength, as if this were done a supply of men to guard prisoners of war used for any purposes would be assured.Horses.   The War Office have agreed to the reduction in the charge for the loan of Army horses from 4/- to 2/9d. per horse per day where the horse does not return to quarters each night, and an Army Council Instruction to this effect has been issued.     Commanding Officers have also been informed that horses may be allowed out without their military drivers in oases where a skilled ploughman is available at the farm.These revised arrangements should enable farmers to makemore use of any Army horses available at depots.     Several furtherrequests for assistance with the loan of horses have been referredtc6.
the War Office, and in this connection, it is reported that in the Western Command, 1,200 Army horses are now out on loan to farmers..Womenfs Branch. In all 237 Selection said Allocation Committees have nowbeen appointed in 41 counties.The demand for women labour varies considerably in . different parts of the country.   For example, in East-Suffolk and Somerset there is an urgent demand.     On the other hand, in the Holland Division of Lincolnshire, while there is a great shortage of labour generally, farmers refuse to employ women from outside the county, and it is proposed instead to use children of 12 years of age for potato dropping;    and in Oxfordshire, the Committee feel that the minimum wage for women under the National Service Scheme (namely 18/- a week), will cause discontent among workers, as the wages in the county for local women are 2/- per day for whole-time workers.A circular has been issued explaining   the duties of Group Leaders for part-time workers, and suitable women are being selected by the Department to be supplied to counties who are unable to provide Group   Leaders locally.     The employment of part-time women workers is frequently impeded owing to their inability to provide for themselves suitable footwear.     Application has, therefore, been made to the Treasury for a grant to enable County Committees to assist in the provision of boots through County Boot Clubs.Arrangements have been made with -the G.P.O. by which the outfits to be provided for women will be delivered by the Army Clothing Department to the P.0.  and distributed by them to the various County Committees.An arrangement has been made between the Department and the National Service Department by which the Women&apos;s War Agricul-tural Committees are to be asked to nominate two or three persons in each county to assist in recruiting, one of these to be appointed a Sub-Commissioner for Agricultural Recruiting. 84 meetings are in process of being arranged, and more are being prepared for.
Machinery Section.Ufttor Tractors.    During the week a further 29 privately owned tractors have been placed under the Departmentfs control, bringing the total under this head up to 470^     The total number of Government owned and controlled tractors and ploughs is now 668, In connection with the negotiations for bringing privately owned tractors under Government control, 329 definite   refusals have been (received, and the Department is still in correspondence with 731 i owners.Ten further motor engineers have been appointed, bringing jthe total appointments under this head up to 292.A considerable number of men procured both from military and civilian sources hasre received instruction at Lincoln in the driving and management of Caterpillar tractors.   Steam Tackle -Applications for the return of 26 specially classified men have   been made this week,     29 men have been ordered to be returned to civil employment, which, taken with the number mentioned in last week!s Report brings the total up to 176IV. SUPPLIES. Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Section. Sulphafie of Ammonia- Returns received in the last week of March showed that the stocks of sulphate of ammonia in makers1 hands had been reduceto 17,000 tons, of which 13,000 tons were sold for immediate delivery.   These quantities are less than at any previous date, and indicate a good agricultural consumption.   The Department in co-opera-tion with the Ministry of Munitions are making arrangements to prevent delivery being delayed,owing to shortage of trucks. Superphosphate--Instructions have been given for a second cargo of superphosphate to be loaded at Lisbon, and a ship has been chartered for this purpose.     The shipment of 3,850 tons of superphosphate from Tunis has been arranged and the necessary licence to export has been obtained from the Tunisian Government.
Basic Slag - A stock of about 2,000 tons was being held by one firm of Basic Slag makers owing to the very high price which, in the absence of any local competition, this firm was charging.   The firm have been communicated with, and they have reduced the price and disposed of the stock.Miscellaneous ^Fertilisers - In view of the small available sup-plies of sulphate of ammonia, superphosphate and basic slag, all firms holding any stocks of compound manures or other fertilisers have been asked to arrange fcr the immediate sale of all fertilisers held by them in time for use on this season&apos;s crop, A determined effort will be made to ensure that no stocks cf fertilisers remain in makers 1 or dealers 1 hands at the end of this month. rices of Maize - Notices have been sent out as the price of maize at ports, and local enquiries are now being made with a view to ascertain conditions of trade at markets supplied from London, Bristol, and Liverpool.Binder Twine - The enquiry into binder twine indicates some dif-ference of opinionas to the probability of a shortage.   The estimated production this season together  vith the actual imports to date is about 13,000 tons, while the estimated consumption of the United Kingdom is 15,000 tons.   Considerable quantities remain to be shipped, while several makers say they can increase their output if there is sufficient demand.   Further consideration is being given to the matter in conjunction with the Ministry of Munitions.Seeds Section. During the week 2,225 tons of Irish seed potatoes have been landed at English ports, of which about 1,000 tons is being sent to Cornwall by special train, the planting season being earlier there than elsewhere.
About two-thirds of the 6,500 tons being obtained has already been dispatched.   Tho weather is, however, interfering greatly with tho delivery from Scotland and unfortunately some consignments have suffered injury from frost in transit.The applications for seed are very numerous.   &quot;Waiting lists&quot; are being prepared, and after orders received through the War Agricultural Committees have been executed, the most deserving cases on these lists will be dealt with.The Department would like to supply &quot;seed&quot; for allotments formed under the Cultivation of Lands Order, to hop-growers who have grubbed in accordance with the Board&apos;s advice, and to Executive Committees for areas of land they have broken up, and they have accordingly, made informal enquiries about the stocks still available in Ireland, as it is known that no more seed can be procured from Scotland.   Definite information cannot be obtained; but it appears likely that if strong pressure is brought to bear on the Irish authorities, several thousands of tons could be secured in addition to the 6,500 already arranged for.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.Et. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
