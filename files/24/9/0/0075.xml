EGYPT I All EXPEDITIONARYFORCE.PregentTHE PRIME MINISTER (in the Chair)The Right Hon. the EARL CURZOHOf EEDIE3T0H, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.B.Lieut-Col. SIR MAURICE P. A.BANKEY,. K.C ,B.Lieut-Col. Sir EARK SYKES, Bart.. M.P.SIR MARK SYKES stated that the Political Mission arose cut of the following decision&apos; reached et tho&apos;Anglo-French Con-ference held at 10 Downing Street on December  8, 1916, (1.0,-13, Conclusion 7)&quot;The British Government agreed that when the British forces now operating in the Sinai Peninsula enter Palestine a French Moslem detachment should &quot;be associated in the operations, and a French Political Officer should be attached to the British Commander-in-Chief.     The British Government undertook to warn the French Govern-ment as to when the eventuality referred to was likely to occur.&quot;THE PRIMS MINISTER read the Foreign Office instructions to Sir Mark Sykes.   (Enclosure).   He asked Sir Mark Sykes to explain what action he proposed to take?SIR MARK SYZES stated that he hoped to open up relations with the various tribes in that region, and, if possible, to raise an Arab rebellion further north in the region of Jebel Druse with a view to attacks on the Turkish lines of communica-tion, particularly against the railway between-Aleppo and Lamascus.     Although the King of the HedjaVs country did not
come within his sphere, he would be in communication with Faisal 307 through the High Commissioner of Egypt.     It would be necessary for him to maintain communication with Sir Percy Cos through the twe Commanders-in-Chief., since the tribes under the authority of Huri ShalaTan extended right across into the Mesopotamian area. His modus operand! would be first to establish his Headquarters with the Army somewhere across the Frontier of Egypt, then to return to Cairo and report fully to the- War Cabinet;(DEE PRIME MIHIBTLR and LORD CUR &quot;OH both laid great stress on the importance of not committing the British Government to any agreement with the tribes which would be prejudicial to British interests.     They impressed on Sir Mark Sykes the diffi-culty of our relations with the French in this region end the importance of not prejudicing the Zionis^moTemeirb and the possi-bility of its development under British auspices.     The attach-raent of a French Commissioner and of two French Battalions to General Sir A.Murray&apos;s force was a clear indication that the French wished to have a considerable voice in the disposal of the conquered territories, and the recent negotiations of Colonel Bremond with the King of the Ho&amp;Jaz showed how pertinacious they were were in these matters. . -THE PRIME-MINISTER,suggested that the Jews might be able   . to render us more assistance than the Arabs.     He pointed out that there were a considerable number of Jews now in this country who as motor-drivers and guides were intimately acquainted with Palestine, and he suggested that they ought to be employed in this theatre rather than at homo.SIR MARS SYKES, while agreeing that every possible as-sistanco should be obtained from the Jews, said that it was important not to stir up any movement in rear of the Turkish line which mi,r;ht lead to a Turkish massacre of the Jews..    He said that the Arabs probably realised that there was no prospect of their being allowed any control over Palestine, and that the Jews, though originally pro-Turkish, were tending, he thought,. &apos; 7-&quot;-.&apos; P -&apos;    .,:.   &apos; - . . &apos; &apos;-&apos;     .
to become much loss &quot;Anti-Arab.     $hero was a distinct ;x&amp;pprochenont in fact,LORD OURZOH pointed out that when he visited Palestine tke Jews were in a great minority in that country.SIR MARK SYKBS said that since &quot;then a number of Zionistcolonies had been established in Palestine.     He pointed outthat by Article 8 of his Instructions he was debarred fromentering directly into political negotiations in the PalestineArea until it was actually occupied, in which latter event hewould ash for instructions from the Wer Cabinet.(At this point there was some discussion on the map tc illustrate&apos; tho scheme for the partition of Turkey.)TEE PRIME MINISTER laid stress cn the importance, if      I possible, of securing the addition of Palestine to the British area. *LORD .CURZ0H strongly criticised the allocation of Alexsn-dretta and contiguous spheres of Asia Minor tc the French, and said that,, in his opinion, the French had got much the best of the bargain,.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that Sir Mark Sykes ought not to enter into any political pledges to the Arabs, and particularly none in regard to Palestine.- SIR MARK SYXES pointed out Jfchat he cculd hardly negotiate at all with the tribes outside the British and French areas without referring to the possible creation of an Arab StateLORD OURZOH said that while he criticised the arrangc-ments with the French, he did not quarrel with the arrangement for the establishment of an Arab State.     Moreover, he pointed out that this was actually included in the signed agreement from which we eould not depart.THE PRIME- MIinSTTlR enjoined on Sir Mark Sykes the importance of using great caution and reporting fully to the War Cabinet.s, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.April 3, 1917a- 3&apos;
