Memorandum for the War Cabinets In view of the recommendation by the War Cabinet, recorded in their Minute of the 16th February 1917, that increased efforts should be made to organise the collec--tion of waste paper, the Secretary for Scotland arranged for the issue of a circular by the Local Government Board for Scotland to Scottish local authorities, of which copies are appended.     The circular contains sug--ges Lions for the collection and utilisation of waste food and other refuse, as well as waste paper. Scottish Office, Whitehall,7th April,1917.
Public Health. No. II.   1917.Local Government Board,Edinburgh, 31s  March 1917.waste food, paper, etc.Sir,I am directed by the Local Government Board for Scotland to draw the attention of Local Authorities to the importance at the present time of utilising waste food, particularly fat and bones, and other organic waste both of animal and vegetable origin, and also waste paper, cardboard, etc., wherever this is practicable.Waste Food, etc. -Co-operation in the collection of waste food was suggested in the circular of the 17th January on the subject of pig- and poultry-keeping. The Board are aware that much more is being done in. some districts than in others, and they accordingly urge upon all Local Authorities the desirability of every possible step being taken to secure that waste food is collected and utilised either directly or through contractors or by means of voluntary associations.Special provision appears generally to be made for collecting and using the waste from hotels, restaurants, schools, canteens, clubs, and other large establishments. Each Local Authority should ascertain whether all that can be advantageously done in this way in their district is being done. If it is not, they should immediately consider what measures can be adopted for using the waste as food for pigs or poultry; it may be sufficient in some cases to draw attention to the opportunities which exist of obtaining waste for pigs or other stock. In the case of private households, except where the householder keeps stock of his own for which the waste of the household is being used, a number of inhabitants may be induced to combine together for the utilisation of waste which can be collected by or on behalf of those who can make profitable use of it.At some places special measures are taken for utilising the waste of slaughterhouses and condemned food, and the Board would ask Local Authorities generally to consider what can be done in this respect in their districts. They would also emphasize the special value of bones and fat for the production of glycerine for munitions purposes.The separate collection of bottles, jars and tins will also be found to be profitable at the present time.Waste Paper. The new restrictions on the importation of paper have made it more important than ever that the greatest economy should be practised in the use of paper, and that all waste paper should be utilised. In many districts the collection of waste paper, cardboard, etc., is already undertaken by waste paper dealers or through voluntary organisations, and it is not suggested that there should be any interference with these methods of collection. More can, however, be done, and the Board hope that all Local Authorities will use their best endeavours to stimulate action. Waste paper should not be burned in dust destructors, and Local Authorities should arrange where possible for its separation from other refuse, if collected at the same time. Householders should be urged through the local press to keep it separate from other refuse.The Board have received from the Eoyal Commission on Paper the appended list of paper mills in Scotland that use waste paper. Local Authorities would do well to put themselves in communication with any of these mills which may be in their neighbourhood or readily accessible.The present price of waste paper enables many voluntary organisations to collect it and dispose of it at a profit. Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Church Guilds, and other similar bodies have beenv&quot;usefully employed in this work, the proceeds being devoted toM &amp; G Ltd  Wt 6462/1938  3-17  1000  G. 2

This is a movement which Local Authorities might usefully encourage.It is understood that for the profitable disposal of waste paper it should be sorted into the following grades (1) Old ledgers and account books.(2) Letters and envelopes.(3) Old newspapers.(4) Books and pamphlets.(5) Brown and wrapping paper.(6) Cardboard, strawboard, etc.It will, no doubt, be found that the mills will wish to receive their waste paper from local centres in comparatively large consignments, preferably not less than two tons, and, where possible, it would be desirable to compress the paper, when sorted, into bales before dispatch.While offering the foregoing suggestions, the Board leave to Local Authorities the precise measures to be adopted, but they desire to impress strongly on them the importance in the first place of reducing preventible waste, and, secondly, of making-profitable use of such waste matter as is unavoidable.The Board will be glad to be informed as soon as this can conveniently be done of any action taken in the district.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,
