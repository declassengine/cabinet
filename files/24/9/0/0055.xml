PROPOSED JEWISH CORPS FOR SERVICE IN EGYPT AND PALESTINE

(Letter from Mr. Jabotinsky to the Prime Minister, dated 24th January 1917, together with a Memorandum).

29, Shawfield Street,

Chelsea.



Sir,

     We have the honour to submit a proposal to raise a Jewish Regiment for service in Palestine and Egypt. As this scheme is connected with certain political issues, we have been advised to present it directly to the Prime Minister, and we respectfully beg you to consider it and to submit it to he consideration of the War Cabinet and of the other authorities concerned.

We enclose copies of different documents (S. Appendix I and 2) stating the part we both took in the formation, and Capt. Trumpolder the activity of the Zion Mule Corps which served with the British Army in Gallipoli. After it was formed we continued negotiations with the Authorities, respectively in London and Cairo, for the purpose of raising a larger Jewish unit. We understand that the Foreign Office was not unsympathetic to the idea, in view of the political effect in America, but the War Officer did not at that time consider the matter of sufficient importance. During September and October last we organised a recruiting campaign in the East of London, by means of a special daily newspaper and public meetings; it had the personal approval of the then Home Secretary (s. Appendix 3a and 4a), but official encouragement was refused and we had to stop our propaganda since, without sanction of the Authorities, it was evidently useless.

Now that the British Offensive in Palestine has begun, and the question of enlisting the alien Jews is still acute, we think it our duty to renew our suggestion.

We take the liberty to add that in sending this memorial to you we mean to address not only the Prime Minister, but also a man who knows, by origin and by experience of struggle, the feeling of a little nation. We fear that our nation will be forgotten on the day of reckoning, and we ask for a chance of recording its claims. We ask for the Jew the privilege the Welshman has - to fight for his country; to fight like the Welshmen docs - in Regiments of his own, not scattered and nameless.

                                                    We remain,

                                                    Sir,

                                                    Your obedient servants,





To the Right Honourable

 The Prime Minister,

 David Lloyd George, M.P.

Government tho follo7/ing scheme:(1) Tho Government shall form a Jewish Regiment for fighting service in Palestine and Egypt.(2) Tho Jov/ish Regiment shall he composed(a) of Russian Jews to bo enlisted in the United Kingdom, in Egypt or other Dominions, by voluntary recruiting or other methods;(b) of Russian Jews to be onlistcd by voluntary recruiting in Eranoc and in such neutral countries, as will-be found advisable;(c) of such British Subjects as should volunteer to servo with&apos; this unit.(3) $he nucleus of the Regiment dhall bo formed immediately:(a) of tho 150 Russian Jews, enlisted In Egypt,   : most of then now being trained in the20th Battn., -London Regt., Winchester;(b) Of tho second batch of&apos;Russian Jews enlisted in Egypt, 280 in total, who are expected here within tho nozt woeks;(c) of tho Russian Jews in the London rrea who have   voluntarily attested boforo   October 25th 1916, about 200 in total.Sum (approximate) e 2 Companies.(4) H.LI. Government shall provide the commanding officers for- which rank discrimination of religion or race should not bo considered necessary.British Jews now trained in the various 0.1,0. Shall bo given an opportunity to volunteer for scrvioo in th e : J e w i s h Reg imo nt.Itcn fit to bo trained as - junior officers&quot; shall be solectod from the&apos; educated -elements af tho onlistcd aliens, and shall be plaood under Section 175, (8)., of tho Army Act,(5) The Government shall authorize, endorse and facilitate a rocruitirg campaign, on lines to bo drafted with the consent of tho Authorities., for which campaign tho undersigned, if rccuested, shall fui-nish the staff and the funds.
In oxplarftion of the preceding suggestions wo have tho honour to add.She undersigned yore the&quot;initiators of the movement among the Jewish refugees in Egypt which resulted in the form-ation of tho Zion Mule Corps - a body which , under the command of Lt.Col. Patterson and, after his departure, of Capt.Trumpoldcr (one of tho undersigned)served through the whole sd  Gallipoli campaign, earning full appreciation of the Military Authorities and mention in dispatches (S. Appendix 1, 2, 3 and 4).&apos;Our original scheme was to raise a fighting Jewish Legion for the Palestine front;   owing to the military requirements of tho time (March 1915) it had to be reduced to the proportions of a see 11 -transport unit,     But we have over since advocated before the Authorities in England and Egypt tho idea of a larger Jewish unit for fighting service;   and in September -October last wc organised? with the approval of the then Home Secretary, a recruiting propaganda in the Bast End of London, the expenses of which, including a special daily news-paper, wore paid from private sources, without any burden to tho Government (3, Appendix 5).At tho present moment wo think it our duty to make a supromo effort in the same direction^     Three circumstances encourage us in the hope that our scheme will now be considered by the Government with more sympathy.They arc : .   .(1) Tho British advance on Palestine.(2) The fact that there arc over 30^000 Russian Jewsof military ago. in this, country, and that bho problem of their military utilization still remains unsottlcd;(3) The condition of Jews in the East ox Europe, which is being interpreted by Germans, especially in America, as a contradiction to tho principles oon-toiinel in the Entente 1 s reply to Hr.eilson1 s note,wo respectfully submit that tho formation of a Jewish Regiment for Palestine would respond to all tho three points mentioned:    the unit could be made immcdiato-ly available oh a very important front, the question of aliens cf military ago would bo settled, and tho impression would strongly counterbalance the Gorman effort to accuse tho Entente as a whole /of indifference to the tragedy of the Jewish Nation.V/o trast that HCLI. Government arc fully aware of the partiouxat importance inherent to the Jewish question in connection with this War.     This war has boon declared &quot;bo bo not only a conflict of, armed forces, but of political principles.     Evidently, therefore, neutral countries, and especially America whoro^tons of thousand^ of Jews play prominent and honourable rolos in all brandies of life, cannot ignore&apos; the abnormal condition of tho Jewish people in certain areas;   and the silence of tho Jo stem -rowers on this question is bound to be misinterpreted.     On the other &quot;hand, it is understood that the Western Powers carnot influence the inner policy of their Eastern Allies.     Therefore, the only course open to them in order to meet tho natural Jewish grievances is to give a certain official recognition to the old 2ionist ideal of the Jewish people and to call the Jewish youth to fight on the side of the Allies for the libera-tion of Palestine.
-4-9IL?This appeal must &quot;be addressed h  the Government to the   w^fo 50,000 Kapsian Jews oil military ago in this country.     She eroerionco of our roc;;uiting oaarjaign among the Hast-Bad Jews in&quot;September and October 1916 has convinced us that its failure was duo to the absence of any official, endorsement of tho Jewish legion Dchomo.    But wc firmly bcliovo that the result will be most satisfactoryrif tho call to  join a Jc/ish unit for Palestine -will have tho public sanction do f the Authorities.  - Tho success of thr recruiting-campaign would bo specially -great if it wore possible for tho authorities, in sanctioning the Corps, to make use of such language as - perhaps without typing tho British Government dovm to a particular form of political settlement for the future of Palestine, would be favourable to Zionist aspir at ions,A.S tho first stop of tho recruiting campaign wo should suggest the immediate formation of a nucleus, composed of material already at hand as stated above (sub. &quot;3&quot;).     Small as it would appear, its official formation would constitute a powerful moans of propaganda for voluntary enlistment.To bo sure, wo arc aware, and wo oirpoot that the Government arc awaro. of the. general fact that voluntary recruiting at this stago of the v/ar cannot meet with tho same success which greeted it in tho first period of enthusiasm.     This applies not to aliens only,     v7c arc Convinced that a voluntary effort, under conditions mentioned above,&quot;will bring satisfactory results.    But, should the Government decide to go further and apply at a later dato compulsory methods, the Jewish Regiment scheme would even then recommend itself strongly and naturally.     Conscription for a Jewish unit, destined to; fight  or a Jewish future in Palestine, would moan the&apos;minimum&apos;pt friction and&apos;bitterness in this country, of criticism an5T&quot;rbsontmcnt abroad.&quot;.7c arc, moreover, satisfied that tho format!on of a Jewish Regiment for Palestine -would immediately attract a number of Russian Jews from France and certain neutral countriesi (especial-ly Switzerland and Scandinavia) most of them men of higher education.     The political value of theso continental recruits should not bo gauged by their numbers only.     Sach of then would mean an entirely -spontaneous manifestation of trust in the lint onto which would not pass un-noticcd in the neutral world.&apos;./o abstain, for &quot;die. present, from insisting definitely on the two groator areas of possible recruiting - America and Russia, but perhaps at a later stago this side of the ouostion should also be considered,    - recruiting campaign for tho Axaorican Jewry could be- organised in a form   not offending the neutrality, and its results, in recruits as&apos;well as in pro.Entente feeling, would be vary considerable.     Russia has still a huge reserve of un-mobilizod young men, among thorn tons of thousands of educated Jewish youths,     Prom personal inquiries in aotrograd as woll as from tho official support accorded to our endeavours by the late Count Bcncicoudorff in London and Minister Plenipotentiary Smirnoff in Cairo (S. appendix-2) wc understand that the Russian Government, If officially requested, would not be unwilling to allow volunteers to come from Russia.     Under ouch conditions tho Jewish Regiment could assume proportions worth the grostost crxort.It would be premature to discuss hero the technical difficulties which our scheme may involve;   but wo firmly believe that they arc of a minor character and cannot counterbalance tho obvious advantages,     -Jo will only mention the main objection -absence of officers - in ordor to state that in September, before starting our East End propaganda, wo wore -oorsonally authorized by a number of fully qualified British Officers, ranging from
