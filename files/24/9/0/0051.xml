21,349. -       - &apos; fWAR OABLMET.Exemption ^vf^mgn employed on agricultural work.-.With reference to the Resolutions&quot; of the House of Commons Agricultural Ccmmittee (circulated as G.T. 174). the following observations- have been communicated by tho Secretary of State for War :-1. Instructions have already been issued that only men fit for General Service, Category &quot;A&quot;, should be taken from Agriculture.2 &amp;3   The number cf men to be called up from agriculture is already limited by the War Cabinet.    The procedure suggested in these resolutions to a considerable extent is already in operation since instructions have been given that the action of calling up men engaged in agriculture by the R.O. is to be taken in co-operation with the Agricultural Representative.4.    This resolution is entirely approved.5.    Steps are being taken as rapidly as possible to carry these out,  and as soon as substitutes can be obtained from the recruiting reservoir to repla.ce these men in the Home Defence Forces, the men will.be released.6.    This cannot be agreed to in regard to officers and men who are likely to become &quot;A&quot;.    Great pains have been taken to ensure the course of supervision and treatment to enable officers and men to become &quot;A&quot; and fit for.General Service as soon as possible.-  If they were given furlough for agricultural work, it would be impossible to forsee how noon they might&apos;become fit and in many cases they&apos; would take no steps,  rather the contrary,  to become fit within a .. reasonable time. -7.    Ho such decision has been arrived at. Consideration is still being given to individual applications for release on compassionate grounds and. so- on.   Applica-tions for&apos;- individual, reinforcements are not^cconsidered since under existing schemes reinforcements are provided in bulk from Hume Defence men and agricultural companies to County War Agricultural Committee f-jr distribution as they may think best.War Office. 31.3 * 17.
