OMMITTEE OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY.nterim Report on certain Essential Industries.To the Right Honourable D. Lloyd George, M.P., Prime Minister.Sir,We have the honour to submit a further Interim Report in which we deal with certain essential industries and make certain general recommendations in connection with this branch of our inquiry.1. In approaching the consideration of subhead (a) of our Terms of Reference, it is necessary to make clear the precise sense in which the expression &quot; essential to the future safety of the nation &quot; is to be taken. It is, of course, obvious that the great staple trades, such as Coalmining, the Iron and Steel Industry, Engineering, Shipbuilding, the Electrical Trades, and the Textile and Chemical Industries, are of vital importance to the economic life of the nation, both in peace and war. The steps necessary for the maintenance and development of these trades after the war are in most cases being examined by special expert Committees, the reports of which we shall receive in due course, and we think, moreover, that the position of these trades will most conveniently be considered by us in connection with subheads (6) and (c) of our reference. We do not therefore deal with these large industries in the present report.2. There are, however, certain special commodities, which, whilst the branches of industry engaged thereon, are not of such magnitude, are essential to national safety as being absolutely indispensable to important^ British industries, and were supplied before the war entirely or mainly from present enemy sources or from sources under present enemy control. We are informed that in drafting the first of the Permanent Resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference (C. I.) the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government had especially in mind industries (which have come to be known as &quot;key&quot; or &quot;pivotal&quot; industries) concerned with the production of com-modities of this kind. We understand that in the cases of synthetic dyes and of spelter, which are clearly of this character, action is already being taken by His Majesty&apos;s Governriient to secure the maintenance of a permanent supply in the United Kingdom.3. As regards dyes, we are informed that the action taken up to the present has been as follows: (i) The formation of a producing association of consumers to which substantialfinancial assistance has been given by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the form of an advance up to a maximum of 1,700,0001., secured by debenture, but paying only a low rate of interest (4- per cent.). The advance is repayable in 25 years, and so long as any portion is outstanding, the dividend on the ordinary share is limited to 6 per cent.(ii) A grant of 100,000Z. (payable at such time as the Company may desire, butwithin 10 years) for scientific research in respect of the production of synthetic dyestufls.A number of other companies, including two of substantial importance, are engaged in the manufacture of dyestufts, and we understand that, the question of* When using the word &quot; British &quot; in this Report we intend it to include the whole of the BritishScope of Report.Synthetic Dyes.Empire. -a   (33)2520  Wt 68693   G- 12   250  3/17   e &amp; SA.
arrangements to secure co-ordination of effort, and the prevention of overlapping are under the direct consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government; and that it is also proposed that the importation of foreign dyestuifs shall, for a term of years, be pro-hibited except under licenses, to be issued by an authority charged with the general duty of promoting the development of the dye-making industry in this country.Spelter.4. In the case of spelter, we are informed that negotiations between the British and Australian Governments have resulted in an agreement whereby the former under-takes to purchase for a period of 10 years the output of zinc produced in Australia from Australian ores, up to a maximum of 45,000 tons per annum; and also a minimum of 100,000 tons per annum of Australian concentrates, with an option of taking a farther 50,000 tons per annum. For the purpose of developing spelter production in Australia, His Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to make certain advances to the Australian Government, repayable within a prescribed period. Provision is being made for the treatment in the United Kingdom by British controlled companies of the concentrates so purchased, by the erection of two large zinc-smelting works adjoining Government explosive works-each for the treatment of a minimum quantity of concentrates, in the one case entirely Australian and in the other Burmese and Australian, His Majesty^ Government making advances to meet the cost of erection of the works at a minimum rate of interest and repayable within a limited term of years. It will be necessary to provide for the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to take over the works should necessity arise, and for British mine owners to be given reasonable opportunity to dispose to the companies of such ores as they can produce.5. The Board of Trade have asked us to give immediate attention to two other commodities, namely, tungsten and magnetos, and in the present report we propose to deal with these and certain other commodities which fall within the special definition given in paragraph 2 and to lay down also the general lines which we consider Government action in this connection should follow in future. In view of the special nature of these commodities, our proposals are put forward inde-pendently of any recommendations which we may hereafter make as regards the general commercial policy to be adopted after the war.Tungsten.6. Upon the question of the supply of tungsten we have received an advance report from the Engineering Industries Committee in which proposals summarised below are put forward.Tungsten is a metal of high specific gravity which is used in the form of tungsten powder or ferro-tungsten to some extent for the making of filaments for electric lamps and largely as an alloy.with steel in the production of cutting tools which retain their hardness at high temperatures. The use of this material allows the speed of machines and the depth of cutting to be increased far beyond what was possible with older forms of tool steel and it is an absolute necessity in modern engineering.Tungsten is made from wolfram ore, which is largely produced within the British Empire, especially in Burma and Australia. Portugal and Bolivia are also large producers. There are mines in Cornwall which could not, however, be worked with profit before the war. Since the war a very large output has been obtained in the United States. The output of ore within the British Empire is amply sufficient to produce all the tungsten required in this country in normal times for the manufacture of high-speed steel.Before the war only a negligible quantity of tungsten was being made in this country and the manufacturers of high-speed steel relied entirely for. supplies upon Germany, where the manufacture was carried on in association with large chemical undertakings. There is evidence that attempts to . establish the industry in this country were met by organised price-cutting from Germany.. 7. After the outbreak of war arrangements were made, with the co-operation of the Indian, Australian and New Zealand Governments, to ensure that all wolfram ore
produced within the Empire should be sent to this country. Reduction works were started, and there are now eight or nine works of varying degrees of importance engaged in the production of tungsten powder and ferro-tungsten.&amp; We consider it essential to the safety of the nation that tungsten should be manufactured within the Empire after the war on such a scale as to supply domestic requirements and afford a.margin.for export. so that any sudden increase in our own requirements may be ^readily met.. . This object will be secured if: sufficient supplies of ore are ensured, and the reduction works now established in. this country are main-tained and kept efficient. - ...8. As regards the supply of ore, the Board of Trade have referred tous com-munications from British companies engaged in the manufacture of-tungsten, inquiring whether assistance would be likely to be given from public funds for the purpose of acquiring for British holders the ownership and control of certain -wolfram mines in Australia, Burma and Peru. We do not recommend that Government financial assistance should be given to promote the purchase of such mines. ^But it is necessary in our opinion to secure to British manufacturers a first claim upon the supplies of ore available within the British Empire, and we think that this object can be attained on somewhat different lines.9. The Engineering Industries Committee recommend the adoption of the following measures which would, of course, require the concurrence of the Governments of India and the Dominions : &quot; All wolfram ore or other ores containing wolfram to pay an export duty on leaving the Empire of 251. per ton under the following conditions and control:(a) A registration fee of 11. per ton to be charged on all wolfram ore or ores containing wolfram moved from one part of the Empire to any other part, but not to apply when the above-mentioned duty is paid. All shipments of wolfram ore or ores containing wolfram to be disclosed to the Customs authorities under penalties.(b) All wolfram ore or ores containing wolfram shall be used or offered . for sale within the Empire, and failing a buyer in the Empire market,such ore shall be offered for purchase to the Government of the country in which. the material is offered for sale, and the price at which the material shall be offered is the world&apos;s price.If the Government does not within 1.4 days wisli to buy, a certificate to that effect shall forthwith be given to the owner of the ore, who shall then be at liberty to sell to any buyer without paying the export duty of 251. per ton referred to above.(c) No transfer, either by way of sale, mortgage or otherwise, in any deposit, mine or concession of ^wolfram ore, or ores containing wolfram, to be allowed unless the transfer shall be approved by the Government and a certificate setting forth details of the transfer, granted for the sum of 11.(d) That all leases or sales of wolfram properties, deposits, mines or concessions, shall be granted or made only on the acceptance of the above-mentioned conditions and regulations.&quot;10. The object of these proposals is to prevent any attempt on the part of foreign agencies to &quot;corner &quot; the available supplies within the Empire, and it will be observed that under the scheme suggested export duty would never in fact become payable. We are told it was intended rather as a penalty upon evasion of the procedure proposed to be prescribed than as export duty proper.On the understanding that the charge of 251. per ton on wolfram ore or ores containing wolfram when exported without Government certificate is imposed as a penalty and not as an export duty in the proper sense of. the term, we agree with the recommendations of the Engineering Industries Committee.11. On the assumption that the supply of the raw material is assured it remains necessary to prevent the manufacturers of tungsten in this country from being crushed by organised underselling by their competitors abroad. The Engineering Industries Committee consider that the works, which have come into existence in this country since, the outbreak of war will be in a sufficiently strong position to resistA 2&quot;
any such, attacks, if for the purpose of meeting German competition after the war they can be granted subsidies or special consideration as regards Excess Profits Tax in relation to the amount of money which they have invested in ore-dressing plant, tungsten producing works, research work and other capital expenditure, regard being had to the exceptional cost of installing works during the war.12. We understand that in the opinion of the Treasury concessions in respect of Excess Profits Duty are not a suitable method of State financial assistance to industry, which, if given, should take the form of open subsidy or loan. In this opinion we concur. We recommend, however, that a special grant be made to manufacturers to cover the extraordinary expense they have incurred in establishing works and increasing their plant during the war, and we suggest that the amount of the grant and the conditions on which and the manufacturers to whom it should be made should be determined by the special Board whose establishment we recommend in paragraph 30. These conditions should in any case include adequate safeguards to secure the maintenance of efficient production and of sufficient stocks of tungsten to meet an emergency.Magnetos.13. As regards magnetos we have had before us notes on the subject supplied by the Admiralty and War Office and we have taken evidence from representatives of the British Ignition Apparatus Association on the position of the magneto industry in Great Britain. We have also considered the Report of the Sub-Committee to the Advisory Committee to the Board of Trade on Commercial Intelligence (Cd. 8181), paragraphs 53 and 54 of which deal with this industry, and we have conferred with representatives of the Admiralty ana the Ministry of Munitions on the subject. The case of magnetos affords a typical example of what is generally known as a &quot;key&quot; industry, because the supply of the article, which is of great importance for all forms of.motor cars, aircraft, motor launches and stationary engines, was virtually mono-polised before the war by the Bosch Company of Stuttgart. Exact statistical data as to the consumption of magnetos in the United Kingdom are not available, but it is estimated by the British Ignition Apparatus Association that prior to the war some 300,000 magnetos were imported into this country and that about 90 per cent, /of this number was supplied by the Bosch Company. We are informed that, but for the large stock held in this country by that Company, the military position at the outbreak of war would have been very serious.Since the war a number of British firms have undertaken the manufacture, and with the assistance of certain Sheffield firms as regards magnet steel and magnetos, have succeeded in producing magnetos of a very high quality. The successful establishment and maintenance of the industry in this- country, are, in our opinion, clearly of very great national importance. The Bosch Magneto is, however, the outcome of a long series of investigations and constant improvements, and the powerful German Company which is also established in the United States as a separate concern, is not likely after the war to abandon its market in the United Kingdom without a strenuous effort to recover it. Accordingly, although in our opinion there is no reason why the British industry should not establish itself firmly in due course, we consider that it will require some special assistance during the first few years after the war.14. The following proposals have been laid before us by the British Ignition Apparatus xVssociation : &quot; (1) That the Bosch Magneto Company in London be wound up immediately. (2) That all enemy patents relating to magnetos be voided for their possible duration.(3) All magnetos or other ignition apparatus, including parts for the same, should be protected in the following manner :--(a) Countries now at war against us total prohibition for at least five years.   After this period a minimum of 33^ per cent, import duty. ;    . (o) All other countries a minimum of 33  per cent, import duty for- five years and 20 per cent, minimum after five, years. .       ..     ^ . ...(4) All Government Departments should purchase,only British made magnetos or other ignition apparatus, and specify the, same lor all subsidised vehicles.
5293(5) No undertakings should be allowed to manufacture magnetos or other ignition apparatus in this country if they are in any way controlled by capital obtained from enemy countries or subjects.(6) It should be insisted upon that all goods be plainly marked on the article itself, where it is clearly visible, with the country of origin.(7) That all advertisements relating to foreign made goods should clearly state the country in which the goods referred to are manufactured.&quot;15. The first proposal is, we are informed, already being carried out, and as regards the second, we understand that the necessary steps under the rules made under the Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (Temporary Rules) Act, 1914, are being taken by the responsible departments concerned in consultation with the British manufacturers.As regards proposals 3 (a) and (6) the evidence given to us indicates that the British manufacturers are likely to be able to satisfy the home demand for magnetos within a reasonable time after the war ends. We are satisfied that, in order to main-tain the industry in this country against the competition of the powerful Bosch Company, it will be necessary to prohibit the importation of magnetos of present enemy origin for an initial period of five years after the war, subject to license. We are further informed that the British magneto is, as a rule, superior in quality to the American, but that, in view of the fact that the manufacture has been set up under war conditions and will require time to adapt \ilself to normal commercial purposes, it cannot compete in price with the American article. In these circumstances we recommend that for the period of five years a duty equivalent to 33^- per cent, ad valorem should be imposed on magnetos and other ignition apparatus and parts thereof imported from all sources other than the present enemy countries or under license from those countries. The substantial protection thus afforded to the industry will be subject to the conditions which we recommend in paragraph 31 of this Report, and at the end of five years the question should be reconsidered with a view to a progressive reduction of the duty.16. As regards the fourth proposal referred to in paragraph 14, the opinion of the Admiralty, in which the representative of the Ministry of Munitions was disposed to concur, was that, in view of the progress made by the industry in this country, such an undertaking might now safely be given. Objection has, however, been taken on behalf of the War Office on the ground that it is essential that the Government ought not to be debarred at any time from obtaining the most efficient ignition apparatus from whatever source.In view of the&quot; necessity of maintaining the industry in this country, we recommend - that an undertaking should be given experimentally for a period of three years after the war, that the Government Departments which are purchasers of motor cars and aeroplanes will stipulate in their contracts for British-made magnetos. The stipulation should be conditional upon the application of a strict standard of excellence and the maintenance of reasonable prices. In this connection also we refer to the safeguards recommended in paragraph 31.The remaining proposals (5), (6) and (7) set out in paragraph 14, raise important questions of general policy with which we shall deal at a later stage of our deliberations.Optical and Chemical Glass.17. A group of industries in the case of which very special treatment is necessary . is that of the Optical Glass and Instruments, and the Chemical and Laboratory Glass-ware trades.   The types of manufacture dealt with lie in the higher grades of the glass industry.    To be successful they require specially skilled operatives and a direction not only commercial but possessing considerable scientific attainments. .They carry meagre possibilities in direct profits and, as a result, have not hitherto interested manufacturers in a degree in any sense commensurate with their import--ance in the industrial progress of the nation.   Although comparatively small.as -regards the amount of capital required to be invested and of labour employed therein, these industries are of vital national importance, both on naval and military grounds &quot;and for all purposes of applied science and scientific research.   We have had evidence ; on the problems involved after the war from Mr. A. S. Esslemont, Administrative; Director; of Optical and Glassware Supplies, Mr. F. Cheshire, Scientific Director of. ...... ...,......     . ^ - - -.--./
Optical Munitions, Ministry of Munitions, and Professor H. Jackson, Professor of Chemistry at King&apos;s College, and from representatives of certain Manufacturers&apos; Associations.Prior to the war this country was virtually dependent upon Germany for these essential articles. 1 The supremacy of the German manufacturers was due not only to their superior scientific knowledge and organisation, but also to the support derived from the steady requirements of a large standing army^ Since the outbreak of war it has been necessary practically to create the industries in this country from the foundation and the efforts made with Government assistance under a department of the Ministry of Munitions specially established for the purpose appear already to have met with a considerable measure of success.18. The main lines of action have been the making of agreements by the Ministry of Munitions, and, where necessary, by the War Office, Admiralty, and Ministry of Munitions jointly, with selected firms, under which in return for Government financial and other assistance they have created plant to produce a required output of adequate quality and variety under specified conditions, the fulfilment of which is supervised by a Government representative with wide powers, including the control of prices and methods of manufacture and the enforcement of a fair-wage clause and the right to secure the training and employment of female and unskilled labour. In certain cases such agreements have been made for a period of 10 years, and provide for the maintenance of a specified war reserve of the material manufactured and the avail-ability of the plant for Government use in the event of future hostilities, and an important feature is an undertaking&apos; by the departments concerned to specify in purchasing optical instruments that they shall be fitted with British-made glass. In other cases advances or other arrangements have been made for the erection of buildings and the supply of modern machinery. Scientific assistance in solving numerous problems has been given by the Ministry of Munitions, and by numerous and eminent scientific men and institutions through the Ministry.A sub-committee on glass and optical instruments, under the chairmanship of Professor Jackson, in connection with the Department for Scientific and Industrial Research, has recently been set up, and one of the most important questions upon which it will advise is the establishment of standards of quality for application by a suitable Bureau of Standards.In connection with, and as a result of, the measures: briefly outlined in this paragraph, much has been done by the manufacturers themselves in the direction of mutual co-operation and the organisation of trade associations.19. We are satisfied that the continuance of commercial and scientific assistance and of detailed control on the lines already followed will be necessary for a con-siderable period. This necessity is, we believe, fully admitted by the manufacturers themselves, who recognise also that such assistance must have as its object and condition the attainment and maintenance of the highest standards of qualitj-.It is clear, moreover, that, in order that the industries may have time and opportunity to adapt their organisation to peace conditions and to train an adequate supply of skilled workers, very special measures of protection against foreign corn-petition will be required at the outset, in view particularly of the great strength and reputation of the German firms. Having regard to the peculiar circumstances of the industries in question, we think that these measures will be regulated most effectively by means of the prohibition of imports from whatever source, except under license, of certain kinds of glass and optical instruments to be specified from time to time by the organisation referred to in the following paragraph.20. It will clearly be necessary that a Government organisation should be continued in existence charged with the supervision and promotion of the glass industries. It was suggested to us that, in view of very technical knowledge required, this duty should be entrusted to a separate department. We think, however, that the organisation required wall more suitably take the form of a special branch of the authority, the establishment of which we recommend in paragraph 30. The general policy should continue to follow the lines indicated in paragraph 18, but we would emphasise the particular importance of the exercise of very great care in the administration of the restriction of imports. We are informed that the output of the British firms is now almost sufficient for our requirements, but it seems doubtful whether for some years it will be fully equal in quality and variety to that of Germany.   Stress was laid by the scientific witnesses who appeared before us upon
the danger of depriving scientific research of the best instruments which can be obtained, and we attach great weight to this consideration. In these circumstances the exclusion of foreign imports must be subject to the condition that an adequate supply of the highest quality is available in this country, and the grant of import licences should be regulated accordingly by the responsible department in consultation with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Control of prices and methods of manufacture should continue to be exercised as at present.,Hosiery Needles.21. We proceed to consider another industry which is of essential importance to the hosiery trade, namely, the manufacture of machine knitting-needles. In this case less elaborate measures will be sufficient. We have received evidence from hosiery needle makers and information from the Board of Trade on the subject.There are two main types of needles known as the bearded and the latch. Of the former and simpler type an ample - supply is available in this country. The latch needle on the other hand, which is used in the manufacture of socks, stockings, gloves, underwear and indeed of all machine-made knitted goods, is a German speciality and was practically a German monopoly before the war. The manufacture of the latch needle is not protected by any patent. Precise figures are not available, but it is believed that of an estimated consumption of 2,000,000 needles a week in this country 95 per cent, was imported from Germany. By strict economy and owing to a change in demand due to war requirements the consumption has been reduced during the war to about a million needles a week. These gross totals include a great variety of needles of different gauges, several hundreds in number. Some types are used in large quantities, others in small quantities, but all are necessary and essential for the production of full ranges of knitted goods. The manufacture of the larger lines has been successfully started in this country, and it is believed that about half a million a week are now being made. We are informed that needles are now being sold at 6s. a hundred as compared with a price of 4s. 6d. to 5s. a hundred before the war, and the belief has been expressed to us that under normal conditions they could be produced in this country at a cost not exceeding that of the German needle by more than 10 or 15 per cent. The difficulty arises in connection with the types for which there is a comparatively small demand. To meet this during the war it has been necessary to procure needles of American make or German needles from American sources. Manufacturers state that apart from the delay and difficulty in installing suitable machinery and training efficient hands, they could not for a time compete on anything like equal terms with Germany on account of the smallness of the British demand for particular types. Germany, having the practical monopoly of the world&apos;s consumption, was able by pooling the orders from all sources to produce every type on a large scale. It is possible that this position may change after the war as the United States and other countries are making arrangements to meet their own requirements.22. We think that the industry will need some assistance immediately after the war. The manufacturers ask for the total prohibition of imports from the present enemy countries for a period of five years, to be followed by tariff protection. No apprehensions are entertained as to competition from other quarters. It is admitted, however, that the demand of the hosiery trades cannot immediately after the war be fully satisfied by the British needle-makers, and that the deficit could not be made up from sources other than Germany. Moreover, the importation of German needles through neutral countries could only be prevented by constant expert examination of consignments from those countries. In these circumstances we recommend that after the war a duty, the rate or rates of which should be determined on the advice of the special Board referred to in paragraph 30, should be imposed on all imported latch needles for such period as may be deemed expedient. . &apos;&apos;Thorium Nitrate,23. The production of thorium nitrate, which is essential to the manufacture of incandescent gas mantles, was, prior to the war, a German monopoly owing to the control exercised, over the deposits in Brazil and Travancore (India) of monazite sand,- from which it is extracted by chemical processes.   The manufacture ^of thea *
maiities which We are informed presents otherwise no special difficulties is obviously of great importance especially in respect of efficient illumination and the conservation of coal supplies.We are informed that since the outbreak of war the German element has been eliminated from the Travancore Company, while a British firm has obtained concessions over further deposits in Travancore, and control over the Brazilian supplies has been secured by a French - company. . It is hoped that arrangements may be entered into between the three firms which will guarantee to the Allied countries adequate supplies of monazite sand at reasonable prices. Provided that the supply of the raw material is assured, it appears to us that no special action on the part of the Government is called for. We recommend that the attention of the Government of India should be drawn to the importance of preventing the sources of supply from again falling under foreign control.Barytes.24. We refer briefly to two other industries which we have had under consideration. The first of these is the production of barytes, a mineral used for various commercial purposes such as the manufacture of colours, wall papers and asbestos goods. Prior to the war more than half the-supply was obtained from Germany and some inconvenience was experienced at its loss. We are informed by the Director of the Geological Survey, which at the request of the Board of Trade conducted a special inquiry into the matter, that ample deposits exist in the United Kingdom. The production is, however, handicapped by difficulties of transport, since the mines are mostly small and often situated in remote districts, and by inferior methods of preparing the barytes for the market.-We understand that the Board of Trade have already made a number of recommendations to the producers on the latter subject and have the question of the provision of improved means of transport in certain cases before them. As in any case in an emergency the production of sufficient quantities is merely one of expense, we do not think that the material can be regarded as of sufficient importance to justify any further special action on the part of the Government.Limit and Screw Gauges.-25. The other is the manufacture of fine limit and screw gauges, which, prior to the war, was carried on as a distinct industry mainly in the United States and to a less extent in Germany, there being only one small firm in this country engaged in this particular branch of production as a speciality. As a rule our engineering firms have made in their own tool rooms such fine gauges as they required for their own purposes, but the use of fine limit gauges has been exceptional rather than general in this country. In the early stages of the war great difficulties were experienced in meeting the very large demand for munition purposes owing to the shortage of skilled workmen, and of appliances for manufacture, but we are assured that, as the result of action taken by the Ministry of Munitions, and with the help of the National Physical Laboratory, the Universities and certain large engineering firms, the shortcomings have to a large extent been remedied. The position before the war appears to have been due to the lack of demand in this country arising from insufficient realisation of the importance of standardising and specialising. The belief has been expressed to us that the experience of the war is producing a recognition of the necessity for better organisation throughout the British engineering trades, with a view, amongst other things, to standardising their work, the effect of which would he the much more general use of limit gauges, but in view of the great importance of the matter we recommend that the Ministry of Munitions, or whatever other Department may assume its responsibilities after the war, should take steps to secure the maintenance of an adequate supply of all types of gauges and measuring instruments by the encourage-ment of competent firms to undertake the business, by the provision of stocks of the special types required for war work which can be put at the disposal of engineering firms in times of emergency, or in such other ways as may be found expedient. We have only to add that this industry affords an example of the importance of enabling a sufficient number of suitably selected workmen to obtain the highest technical training, a matter which we understand is already receiving attention elsewhere.
Drugs.26. A question which raises considerations closely related, to those discussed, in the preceding paragraphs is that of the supply of essential drugs, and we think that it will be convenient to deal with this subject in the present report. Appended is a memorandum relating thereto, furnished to us by the National Health Insurance Commission, which has since the outbreak of the war been charged with the duty of safeguarding supplies, and we have had the advantage of discussing the matter with Mr. John Anderson, Secretary to the Commission. The memorandum states with admirable clearness the problems for consideration, and we have only to add certain recommendations which appear to us to be called for.We reserve for subsequent consideration the general question of surveys of the mineral and other raw material resources of the British Empire, and we need only observe here that the discovery and development of adequate supplies of bromine, bismuth, iodine, mercury and potassium within the Empire should be a special object of any measures which it may be possible to undertake.We understand that the development of the Indian cinchona and quinine produc-tion is already being considered by the Government of India, and that investigations are being made with a view to improving the quality of Indian opium. We suggest that the Governments of Ceylon and the Straits Settlements should be asked to investigate the possibility of increasing the production of coca and ipecacuanha in those colonies. We do not think that any special action to promote the cultivation of medicinal herbs in this country is necessary at the present time,&apos; owing to voluntary action already being taken, but the matter should be carefully watched.27. We propose in a subsequent report in connection with subhead (d) of our reference to deal with the steps which it may be desirable to take with a view to preventing important sources of supply within the Empire from falling under foreign control. It is desirable that the supplies of such essential raw materials should, if possible, be preferentially attracted to this country, but we wish to endorse the view expressed in the National Health Insurance Commissioners&apos; Memorandum that in any steps taken with this object the importance of not raising the price to British manu-facturers should not be overlooked, regard being had to the magnitude of our export trade in drugs. In the case of drugs, the raw materials of which are imported from overseas and the demand for which is liable to a great and sudden increase in a time, of emergency, the possibility of arrangements to secure the maintenance of considerable stocks in this country should be considered by the responsible departments.28. After careful consideration we recommend that the importation from whatever source of the manufactured drugs enumerated under Heading B of the Memorandum, including, if necessary, any therapeutic equivalents, should be prohibited, except under license, for a period of five years in the first instance. We do not think that a prohibition of imports of present enemy origin only could&quot; be effectively applied for more than a short period, as it would be practically impossible, for example, to prevent German synthetic products from being sent to other countries to be finally worked up and thence imported into this country. It will be understood that the precise chemicals to which this restriction should apply will be subject to reconsideration from time to time in the light of changing circumstances.We entirely agree that a special authority should be charged with the duty of administering these measures, of safeguarding the consumer and of watching over the position of this essential industry. This duty might be entrusted to a sub-department of the authority suggested in the following paragraphs of this report, acting in consultation with the National Health Insurance Commission. Or it may be found more convenient that that Commission, with the addition of such powers as may be necessary, should continue for the present, at any rate, to retain the functions which it has exercised in this connection during the war. We should add that in any case the responsible department or sub-department should co-operate closely with the Department for Scientific and Industrial Research.- General.29. Up to this point we have dealt with several typical industries which on account of their peculiar importance appear to us to require special treatment in future. From the consideration of these industries certain principles emerge which call fora  2520 B
notice. We now proceed to state these principles and to make the general recommenda-tions which in our opinion follow from them.In the first place a particular commodity or branch of production which is of great national importance at a given time may not continue to be so, and on the other hand new essential industries may emerge in the future.Secondly, the causes which have rendered British trade dependent upon the present enemy countries for the supply of particular commodities are by no means uniform and the measures required to promote the various branches of industry involved may vary with each individual commodity. The problem will also be affected as new economic and political conditions arise and changes occur in the international situation.It seems to us to be certain that in the future industries of the nature dealt with in this report will always require special and separate consideration and that no general measure will be sufficient to meet their varying requirements. Consequently it is impossible to lay down permanent and uniform lines of State action in this connection; nor are we in a position to frame an exhaustive list of such industries as may from time to time call for exceptional treatment, or to elaborate in detail the precise measures which may be needed in each case. The special recommendations which we have made in the previous paragraphs may themselves require modification to meet the conditions which may actually exist after the war.Establishment of a Special Industries Board.30. In these circumstances we recommend the establishment of a permanent Board (which might be called the Special Industries Board) charged with the duty of watching the course of industrial development and of framing from time to time, when necessary, either on its own initiative or on the application of interested departments or persons, detailed schemes for the promotion and assistance of industries concerned with the production of commodities of the special character indicated in paragraph 2 of this report.This organisation should take the form of a Board of commercial and industrial experts, associated with whatever Department of State is entrusted with the care of the commercial and manufacturing interests of the country, and represented in Parliament by the political head of that Department. It should be a statutory body with a permanent chairman and with power to appoint such secretarial and technical staff as it may require from time to time. It should issue an annual report of its proceedings, and such special reports as it may think expedient, which reports should be presented to Parliament; and it should be a statutory condition that, except upon its recommendation, no State assistance by way of grant or subsidy should be given to any industry or branch of industry. It should work in close relation and co-operation with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and all other Departments of the State interested in the development of industry, and it should always be cognisant not only of naval and military requirements as they affect industry, but also of the current political relationships of this country, since changes in these respects may obviously bring to light fresh&apos; &quot; essential&quot; industries. -31. The maintenance of efficient and -adequate production at reasonable prices must be a condition of the continued receipt by an industry of special State assistance in any form. In addition to the framing of schemes, it should be the duty of the Board the establishment of which we recommend to watch over the fulfilment of this condition, and for this; purpose it should make such arrangements as to inspection as may be necessary. Where financial assistance is given it should be a condition that the firms or companies in receipt of grants should be entirely British and the grants should be issued only upon a certificate from the Board that this condition and any other conditions which may have been imposed continue to be satisfied, and the repayment of the whole or at least part of any grants should always be kept in view. Similarly, where import restrictions are imposed for the purposes indicated in this Report, the grant of licences should be regulated on the advice of the Board. In any cases in which special protection may have been given against foreign competition by way of tariff or prohibition, it should be a function of the Board to consider complaints that such protection has been impropeily used or has for any reason ceased to be in the public interest;&apos; and&quot; in all cases in which special assistance pf the kinds suggested in this &quot;Report is given the Board -should have power to consider complaints as to the conditions and-terms of employment in such industries, and to require any changes to
Memorandum by Mr. Pease.I concur in the view set forth by my colleagues that a Board should be established which should be in close touch with the requirements of all Departments of State and which should be specially charged with the responsibility for making arrangements that &quot; essential&quot; products are available for naval, military and other Government purposes.I do not, however, think it is probable that to prohibit the importation or to levy a high import duty thereon for a short period will encourage either firms or individuals to establish these industries on a sound basis ; a preferable method would be that the Departments concerned should, on the advice of the Board, make contracts over a period of years with responsible firms for the particular products found from time to time to be necessary. It could be arranged in conjunction with such contracts that in case of emergency additional plant shall be available and that stocks of the raw or manufactured materials shall be kept.With regard to the supply of machinery or materials, such as magnetos, optical and chemical glass, required largely in the general trades of this country, now that the need for these has been brought to the public notice and a knowledge of their manufacture has been obtained, there seems no reason to assume that this country will not be able to hold its own with other nations. It may be shown to be necessary to take special steps to protect both &quot; essential&quot; and other industries of this country if there is organised underselling by competitors abroad with a view to crushing them, but it is advisable to deal with this, if at all, as a question of general policy.If the suggestion that the State should, in normal times, give money grants towards the establishment or carrying on of &quot; essential&quot; industries or otherwise place certain trades or firms in a speciaUy privileged position were given effect to, it would form a dangerous precedent and there is a fear that as time goes on more and more trades will endeavour to establish a claim to grants as &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;key&quot; industries&apos;, and that the policy of subsidies wiU not conduce to economy of production or private enterprise and initiative.(Signed)     ARTHUR F.

APPEWDIX.MEMORANDUM ON THE SUPPLY OP ESSENTIAL DRUGS.[Furnished by the National Health Insurance Commission.)One of the effects of the war has been to emphasize the importance of securing that the British Empire shall be made self-supporting as regards the supply of drugs that are essential to the national welfare. Soon after the outbreak of war a. shortage of many important drugs began to be experienced, not only in the United Kingdom but also in the other allied countries, the shortage being due partly to the lack of certain raw materials of which the chief sources of supply were in enemy territory, and partly because the allied countries had before the war been largely dependent upon Germany for the supply of many important manufactured chemicals. The question whether the Empire can be made self-supporting in the matter of drug supply may therefore be conveniently considered under two heads, namely: (a) Raw materials.(b) Manufactured chemicals.(a) Raw Materials.There is only one raw material of essential importance which is practically unobtainable within the Empire, namely, bromine.Bromine. The salts of bromine are essential in the treatment of many cases of epilepsy and other affections of the nervous system, the potassium salt being the one most in use. The chief source of bromine is Germany, but there are large supplies in the United States, which have been the sole source of bromine for the allied countries during the war. Owing to the American monopoly the prices of the salts of bromine were long maintained at a very high level: potassium bromide, the price of which before the war was Is. Q^d. per lb., could not, during the greater part of last winter, be obtained at a lower price than 25s. per lb.The normal annual consumption of the salts of bromine in the United Kingdom may be estimated at about 100 tons, of which some 75 tons are required for medicinal purposes. In addition, about 80 tons were before the war exported annually. Since the outbreak of war the United Kingdom has supplied large quantities of bromides to Russia and Italy, who formerly obtained their supplies chiefly from Germany, and the total trade of the country in bromides, for home consumption and export, in 1915 probably was not far short of 300 tons.It is important that commercial supplies of bromine should be obtained within the Empire, and surveys should be undertaken with a view to the discovery of such source^. Canada would seem to offer, perhaps, the most promising field for) investigation.The list of essential raw materials which though found Avithin the Empire occur only in quantities that are inadequate for national needs is a much larger one. These materials may be considered under two beads, namely :  (1) Inorganic substances. (2) Vegetable products.1.   The inorganic substances are bismuth, iodine, potassium, and mercury..Bismuth-Bismuth is of great medicinal importance. It is used in medicine in the form of bismuth salts and is much needed, for the treatment of diseases of the digestive system, especially dysentery, for which purposes large quantities are required by the Army. The normal amount of bismuth used in the United Kingdom may be estimated at about 80 tons of the metal annually, of which about 30 tons are exported in the form of salts. Since the outbreak of war the consumption has greatly increased, and the total amount now used for the manufacture of bismuth salts for medicinal purposes, for home consumption and export, is about 250 tons.(1074lr-14.)  Wl). 63884-22.   250.  3/17.   (&amp;)  DkS.  G.&apos;4.
Bismuth is-chiefly derived from Bolivia, the bismuth mines being before the war largely under German control. It is imported in the form of ore or an impure alloy, from which the metal is refined. Formerly the raw material was for the most part imported into Germany to be refined, but since the war the refining of bismuth has been carried out in this country to a large and increasing extent. Bismuth is obtained, however, in substantial quantities from Australia, and deposits have recently been discovered in South Africa. These sources of supply should be developed and surveys undertaken for the discovery of other deposits.Iodine. From a medical point of view iodine is of the highest importance in time of war. During the last two years enormous quantities have been used by the allied Armies for field dressing purposes, each soldier in the field being supplied with a small quantity of a liquid preparation of iodine for immediate application to wounds. For other purposes iodine is much needed. In the form of iodide of potassium it is extensively used in the treatment of syphilis, and as iodoform it is much used in surgery.The worlds supply of iodine is now mainly drawn from Chili, where it is produced as a by-product of the nitrate industry, but considerable quantities are obtained in Norway, France, Scotland, Ireland and Japan from &quot; kelp,&quot; which is a crude slag made by burning seaweed.The total output of crude iodine outside Japan is controlled, and the price fixed by an international syndicate. The price of crude iodine was 9d. per ounce before the war and is now W^d. per ounce. The cost of production in many of the Chilian nitrate factories is not more than l\d. to 2d. per ounce, but in the case of the iodine produced from kelp the cost is much higher. The syndicate, however, fix a uniform price for all the iodine produced under their control, and make it worth while for the kelp production to continue.Normally the United Kingdom requires about 70 tons of crude iodine annually, nearly all of which is used for medicinal purposes. About two-thirds of this quantity is needed for home consumption, the remainder being exported mainly in the form of medicinal salts and preparations but also, to a comparatively small extent, as crude iodine. Since the war began the amount required for medicinal purposes, for, home consumption and export, has been at the rate of about 250 tons annually.Formerly a large quantity of iodine was produced by the Scottish kelp industry; in 1877 the annual output was no less than 60 tons. It is now about 10 tons. The methods of production employed have not been economical, and there seems to be no doubt that with better organisation and more scientific direction sufficient iodine could be produced from kelp in Scotland and Ireland to satisfy home requirements.The Japanese kelp industry, which is independent of the syndicate and is carried on by a large number of small fishermen, produces normally about 90 tons annually, and the annual output is now nearly 135 tons.It is not unlikely, however, that a large increase in the iodine production of this country would be opposed by the syndicate, who obtain their profits mainly from the Chilian supplies, and Government assistance would be necessary to main-tain an adequate output. Such assistance might take the form of the provision of scientific advice and the encouragement of co-operative organisation amongst the producers, but more material assistance would be necessary. The imposition of a duty on foreign iodine would doubtless be opposed by the makers of iodine salts and preparations as being a tax on raw material, and it would seem that the end in view could preferably be obtained by giving a bounty on iodine produced in this country provided a certain maximum production was obtained, or by an undertaking by the Government to purchase all the home output at a certain remunerative price. In connection with the latter suggestion it should be said that the importance of iodine in military surgery is so great that it is advisable that a considerable stock should be maintained in the country under Government control. These considera-tions, however, raise important points of policy which will be referred to more generally later in this Memorandum.Potassium. Salts of potassium, like iodine, were formerly obtained in con-siderable quantity from seaweed, but the discovery of the enormous deposits of potash near Stassfurt made such supplies obsolete.Although the chief use of potash is as an artificial manure, for which purpose about 90 per cent, of the total amount produced is used, it is of considerable medicinal importance.   Before the outbreak of war the world&apos;s supply of potash
was almost exclusively drawn from the deposits of potash salts near Stassfurt in North Germany. These mines are controlled by a syndicate, but the production is regulated by a law which fixes the minimum quantity to be produced for home consumption, the total amount to be exported, and the price of the potash exported. In 1913 the total amount of potash exported from Germany was over 1,800,000 metric tons, the value being over  4,555,000.Deposits of potash occur in Niederbenck in Alsace, and in Galicia, and very extensive deposits have recently been discovered in Spain. Within the Empire the only deposits of potash salts so far discovered are those of the Mayo mine in the Punjab, but considerable quantities of potassium nitrate are obtained from the soils of old village sites in India. The value of the Indian potassium nitrate imported into the United Kingdom in 1913 was  56,630.With the outbreak of war the allied countries experienced a serious shortage of potash salts and, in fact, it became necessary to import considerable quantities of German potash into the United Kingdom through neutral countries. Efforts were made to obtain potash from sources which had become considered obsolete, e.g., sea-water, salt-lake deposits, seaweed, wood ashes, wool washings, &amp;c, but, in spite of the utilisation of these sources, the scarcity of potash has continued to be severely felt.In view of the great importance of potash it is most desirable that deposits should be discovered within the Empire. Surveys by competent geologists should be undertaken in areas which from their geological formation might be expected to contain potash,- and a thorough investigation should be made as to possiblities of the economical production of potash from the seaweeds of the Canadian Pacific Coast.&quot;Mercury. Mercury is of high medicinal importance. It is of great value for many purposes and is essential in the treatment of syphilis. Some of the salts of mercury are important as disinfectants and are much used in the preparation of antiseptic dressings.The quantity of mercury used in this country either in the form of metallic mercury or in the manufacture of mercury salts for home consumption and export is about 500 tons, but by far the greater part of this is used for industrial purposes. The quantity used for medicinal purposes is probably not more than 50-100 tons of which about 20-30 tons are needed for home consumption.The chief sources of^mercury are Spain, Italy, Austria and the United States.hitherto not been developed. They should, however, at least be capable of supplying all the mercury needed in this county for medicinal use..The raw materials that have so far been discussed are simple inorganic sub-stances; it now remains to consider some important vegetable products which may be grouped under two heads, namely,  (1) home-grown medicinal herbs, (2) vegetable products obtained from overseas. (1) The outbreak of war caused a shortage in the supply of a considerable number of herbs which are used for medicinal purposes, and which though growing in this country are normally obtained for the most part from abroad.   The great majority of these herbs are of little medicinal importance, and not more than four can be regarded as essential.   These four are:  Belladonna. Henbane. Foxglove. Colchicum.These herbs are widely distributed throughout Europe, but are specially abundant in Hungary and South Austria, where they are collected and cultivated by a large number of small producers. Normally these countries form the chief source of supply for the United Kingdom, but large quantities of henbane are obtained also from Russia. The four herbs grow wild in this country, but bella-donna, henbane, and to a, small extent foxglove, are cultivated for medicinal use.Of the herbs mentioned,&apos;, belladonna is much the most, extensively used, being required for the manufacture of many important medicaments. It is difficult to form an idea of the quantity of belladonna required for home consumption, but it has been estimated at 50 tons of the dried leaves and100 tons of the dried root. The quantities of henbane, foxglove and colchicum required are very much less.There is sufficient foxglove and colchicum growing wild in the United Kingdom to satisfy the needs of the country, and there seems to be no necessity to devote land10741 a 2It occurs also in New Zealandsources of supply have
and labour to. the cultivation of these plants. This is not the case, however, with belladonna and henbane. Doubtless fairly considerable supplies could be obtained . from the collection of the wild plants, but an adequate supply can only be obtained by skilled cultivation. There seems no reason to doubt that this country could be made self-supporting in the supply of these herbs; since the foreign supplies have been cut off or curtailed by the war the home production has greatly increased and is now probably not far from sufficient for home requirements..(2) Foreign Plants. The essential plants of this group which now occur in insufficient quantities within the Empire are three in number, namely, cinchona, ipecacuanha and coca, and they are of great importance as being the sources from which the alkaloids, quinine, emetine and cocaine, respectively, are extracted.Cinchona. The cinchona bark, from which quinine is extracted, is derived almost exclusively from Java, a comparatively small quantity being grown in India for the use of the Indian Government quinine factories. The production of the Java bark is controlled by a syndicate which regulates the amount of bark allocated to the various quinine factories.After the outbreak of war the allied countries became largely dependent on the supplies of quinine from Java and Holland, where the production could only be gradually increased to meet the increased demand. Marked shortage was, however, prevented by the fact that at the beginning of the war there was a large stock over 3 million ounces of quinine in the London warehouses. This stock has now been reduced to a million and a half ounces, but the production of the factories outside Germany, especially those in Java and Holland, has considerably increased, and it is probable that the world5 s production of quinine at the present time is not below the normal. The amount of quinine produced in the LTnited Kingdom is adequate for home requirements.It seems desirable in the case of so supremely important a medicine as quinine that steps should be taken to increase the production, not only of quinine but also of the raw material, cinchona bark, within the Empire. At the present time cinchona bark is cultivated on a considerable scale in connection with the Government quinine factories in India, the total area under cultivation being 3,468 acres. Considerable improvements have recently been effected in the cultivation of cinchona in India, and the percentage of quinine in the bark has been materially increased. It would seem well worth while to take into careful consideration the possibility of so developing the Indian cinchona and quinine production as to make the Empire independent of outside sources of supply of cinchona and of quinine.Ipecacuanha. Ipecacuanha is an ingredient in several medicinal preparations, but it is chiefly required as the raw material from which is extracted the alkaloid emetine, a drug which is of the greatest importance in the treatment of dysentry. Ipecacuanha is obtained mainly from South America, but small supplies are derived from the Straits Settlements, where the production could be greatly increased. Emetine is made in the United Kingdom in quantities that are more than adequate for the needs of the Empire, but it is important that there should be no dependence on raw material of foreign origin.Coca. Coca is important as the source of the alkaloid cocaine, which is a local anaesthetic of essential importance in ophthalmic surgery. Cocaine is extracted from the leaves of the coca plant, which are obtained from Bolivia, Peru, Java and Ceylon. The world&apos;s production of coca leaves amounts to about 5,000 tons annually, of which only about 30 tons are obtained from Ceylon. Coca leaves contain about 0&apos;5 per cent, of cocaine, and as the amount of cocaine required in this country for legitimate medicinal use is not more than about 4 cwt., there should be no difficulty in increasing the Ceylon production of coca to supply home requirements.Cocaine is not made in this country, and supplies are how being obtained from Holland, but before the war the main source of supply was Germany. Several British manufacturers contemplate making it, and it is not unlikely that before long supplies of British manufacture will be available.Opium. The question of the supply of opium requires special consideration. Before the war the world&apos;s supply of opium for medicinal purposes was mainly derived from Turkey and Persia. The war had the effect of cutting off the Turkish supply and greatly increasing the demand for opium, mainly for the manufacture of morphia. A serious shortage of opium and morphia would have resulted, had it not been for the introduction into this country by the India Office of very large quantities of Indian opium.
The amount of opium produced in India is exceedingly large, and opium certainly cannot be grouped with the drugs that are not produced in adequate quantity within the Empire. But though there is no lack of quantity there are certain defects in quality.Indian opium is not an adequate substitute for Turkish or Persian opium chiefly because it contains a smaller proportion of the important alkaloid morphia. The average morphia content of Indian opium appears to be below 8 per cent., whereas Turkish and Persian opium contains over 10 per cent. It should be possible, however, by improved methods of cultivation and collection, to raise the morphia content and to provide in Indian opium a satisfactory substitute for the Turkish and Persian varieties.The chief alkaloids of opium, morphia and codeia are made in very large quantities in the United Kingdom.In considering the question of the steps that should be taken to make the Empire self-supporting in the supply of the raw materials that have already been mentioned, difficulties are encountered which are partly physical and partly economic. As regards the supply of the home-grown and foreign medicinal plants mentioned the difficulties are chiefly economic; sufficient supplies could be obtained within the Empire if sufficient Government support could be given for the encourage-ment of the cultivation of the various plants. The problem is more difficult in dealing with the elements bromine, bismuth and mercury, which are obtained from mineral deposits. These substances are not at present known to exist in adequate quantities within the Empire; the first step to be taken, therefore, is to discover adequate sources of supply, and it would seem that this should be done as part of a comprehensive survey of the mineral resources of the Empire.Iodine and potassium occupy a special position. Though normally produced from mineral deposits, which form by far the most economical sources of supply, they can be obtained from the burning of vegetable products, iodine from seaweed, and potassium from seaweed and wood ashes. The production of iodine and potassium of vegetable origin would, however, be at a great disadvantage in com-peting with the output from the ordinary sources of supply in Chile and Germany respectively, and it is important that efforts should be made to discover similar sources of supply within the Empire. Iodine and potassium should, therefore, be classed with - bromine, bismuth and mercury amongst the raw materials for the discovery of which in adequate quantities surveys should be made of the Empire&apos;s mineral resources.In view, however, of the great importance of iodine in the treatment of disease and especially in military surgery, the home production of iodine from kelp should be encouraged to the extent of supplying home requirements even though more economical sources of supply should be discovered in the Colonies or in India.The discovery of adequate supplies would, however, be far from solving the problem., It would be necessary also to prevent the supplies from falling under foreign control, and from being ousted from British markets by competing foreign supplies., In this connection it is necessary to bear in mind that before the war the supplies of certain essential raw materials, e.g., bismuth and iodine, were controlled by syndicates on which German interests were powerfully represented, if not predominant, and that after the war these interests will spare no efforts to recover their former position, and either to control the newly developed supplies or by systematic competition to prevent them from establishing a position on the market. These considerations, however, raise important questions of policy which should be discussed in relation to the general question of the commercial policy to be adopted by this country after the war. Such a discussion cannot be attempted in this memorandum, but the following considerations may be put forward.1. To prevent newly developed mineral products from falling under foreign control it will probably be necessary for the Government concerned to exercise close supervision with a view to securing both effective development of the available resources and the beneficial use of the resulting product: in some cases Government monopoly may be the only practicable method of securing the desired result.2. The substances under discussion, viz., bromine, iodine, potassium, bismuth and mercury are raw materials required in large quantities by British manufac-turers. It is important that any steps that may be taken by fiscal changes or otherwise should not have the effect of raising the price of the raw material to the
British manufacturers and so place them at a disadvantage in meeting the corn-petition of German manufacturers in neutral markets.The difficulties in the way of securing adequate supplies of the four medicinal herbs already mentioned, viz., belladonna, henbane, colchium and foxglove are purely economic. The herbs can be grown in any quantity that may be required: the difficulty will be to maintain the British production against the competition of the low-priced foreign herbs. The imposition of an import duty, which has been suggested, would be strongly opposed by the makers of the medicinal preparations of the herbs, including those makers who are themselves growers. Much may be done by the dissemination of information concerning the best methods of collecting and cultivating the herbs, by the encouragement of associations for the local organisa-tion of small collectors and cultivators and by the provision of facilities for drying the herbs. If, however, fiscal changes were found necessary it would seem prefer-able that they should take the form Of giving bounties on home production rather that the imposition of a duty on foreign herbs, a course which the makers of prepara-tions of belladonna, &amp;c, fear would raise the price of their raw material and place them at a disadvantage in competing with the German makers of the preparations of these herbs, who would have large supplies of low-priced raw material upon which to draw.The problem of producing within the Empire adequate supplies of cinchona, coca and ipecacuanha would probably best be solved by the direct cultivation of these plants by the Government in India, Ceylon and the Straits Settlements, from which sources supplies are already obtained. The cultivation of cinchona is now successfully undertaken by the Indian Government and could be greatly extended. One great advantage of Government cultivation would be that it would enable an effective control to be exercised over the sources of supply. Production could be regulated in quantity and developed in quality, and the products distributed where they were most needed in the national interest.The raw materials so far considered are those of which adequate supplies are not now forthcoming within the Empire, and it has been pointed out that after the war it will be necessary to take steps to prevent such supplies as already exist, or may be developed, from falling under foreign control. Similar steps will also be called for in the case of essential raw materials which are normally obtained from within the Empire; among such materials are Egyptian henbane (hyoscyamus muticus) and ajowan seed, which are the sources, respectively, of the important drugs, atropine and thymol. Before the war no thymol and comparatively little atropine were made in this country, and the great bulk of the ajowan seed from India and the henbane from Egypt and the Soudan went via-Hamburg to the German manufacturers. It is a matter for consideration as a question of general policy whether raw materials of such essential importance should not be subjected to&apos; export restrictions, which would direct them into channels most conducive to the national interest.In the case of drugs of essential importance for which the United Kingdom is dependent upon supplies from overseas, it seems desirable that steps should be taken to maintain stocks in this country. This is specially important in regard to drugs like iodine, bismuth and emetine, which are in greatly increased demand in wartime. In the case of some drugs, e.g., bismuth, the stock could most conveniently be kept in the form of raw material, but where, as in the case of emetine, the raw material is far more bulky than the finished product, it would be preferable to stock the manufactured article. The keeping of stocks would not only prevent shortage in times of national emergency, but would also tend to prevent speculation and inflation of prices. The existence of a large stock of quinine at the London docks kept the price of quinine steady during the first year of the war, in spite of great and sudden increases of demand, and it was not until this stock became much diminished that speculative dealings in quinine began in the autumn of 1915. At that time, however, the stock though greatly dhninished was still considerable, and the action of the Government in prohibiting the export of quinine, and so safeguarding the stock, immediately put an end to the operations of the speculators.Since the outbreak of war this Department has been able, by arrangements with manufacturers and dealers and by the regulation of exports, &amp;c, to secure the maintenance in this country of considerable&quot;stocks of bismuth, bromine, opium, and other important drugs, and it seems desirable that action on similar lines should he taken after the war.
B-Manufactured Drugs.Before the war this country was dependent upon Germany for the supply of a large number of manufactured drugs, many of which are synthetic remedies derived from coal-tar, a raw material of which there is an abundant supply m the United Kingdom.The drugs of this class that may be regarded as essential are as follows :-Salicylates Salicylic acid.Acetyl-Salicylic acid.Salicylate of Sodium. Salvarsan. Neo-Salvarsan. Novocain. Phenacetin. Phenazone. Eucaine. Liquid paraffin. Thymol.Before the war none of these drugs, except a small amount of eucaine, was pro-duced in this country; now they are being made here, some in small quantities only, some on a large and increasing scale. The manufacturers have had to contend against exceptional difficulties, shortage of labour, difficulties in obtaining plant, &amp;c, but on the whole it may be said that the difficulties have been successfully overcome, and that it has been demonstrated that the essential medicinal chemicals in the production of which Germany formerly had a practical monopoly, can be made commercially in this country. It is very doubtful, however, whether the British firms will be able to continue their production of these chemicals after the war if they have to meet the unrestricted competition of the old-established German firms, who, working on a large scale and with many years experience, will be able to offer goods at prices with which the British firms will probably be unable to compete.It may, therefore, be found advisable to impose restrictions on the importation of German products, and it would suffice if such restrictions were limited to a few products only, as above indicated, since this would have the effect, which is all that is required, of securing the establishment of a nucleus of production capable of ready expension in emergency.It is important to bear in mind, however, that the success of the German chemical industry has been largely due to the fact that the German manufacturers have been able to obtain enormous quantities of raw material, especially coal-tar, from this country; and it may be found advisable in meeting German competition to place restrictions on the exportation of raw materials from this country to Germany as well as on the importation of certain manufactured products from Germany.The drugs so far dealt with in this memorandum are those which are not produced in adequate quantities within the Empire. Fortunately there are many drugs to which this description does not apply. Certain drugs of the most vital importance, such as the general anaesthetics, chloroform and ether,, and the alkaloids of opium, are produced in the United Kingdom in quantities which not only provide adequately for national needs but also furnish large supplies for export. It is unnecessary to discuss the causes which have contributed to secure the successful production of these articles in this country, but it may be said that it would be unsafe to assume that they will necessarily continue to operate. It is important, therefore, that the future development of the British production of medicinal chemicals should be carefully watched, not only in regard to the expansions that have taken place since the war, but also in regard to the maintenance of normal production, that suitable encouragement should be afforded where necessary and particularly that there should be some agency for bringing scientific workers and manufacturers into touch with each other. It is suggested, therefore, that some Department or Sub-Department of State should be definitely charged with the
responsibility of fostering this new and vitally important industry. The experience of the past two years has shown how much may be done by Government action in. conserving and developing the supply of essential drugs and medical stores and the&quot; need for such action will be intensified rather than lessened after the end of the war.National Health Insurance Commission. 2nd October, 1916.
