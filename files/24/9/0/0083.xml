Subject:-   Report of Russian situation by-Brig,.Gen, Pcole,(Reference P.B-.56)C,i,G-S. Petrograde, --------                                                  March 9/22nd 1917,The recent revolution here has affected the Military situation adversely in the following ways.OOP1.....&apos;. By the closing down here of all the Munition Works and Factories for practically 3 weeks, which will cause a Serious diminution of the output in guns, fuzes, shell and cartridges.     As far as can be ascertained the other works throughout the country have been also shut down in a greater or less degree/2.,, :.. By. the fact that the coldicrs are now completely out of hand, and have stopped, all work since the commencement of the revolution,As regards h     We have spared no efforts to point out to allconcern&apos;-d. Ministers, Labour Leaders and Workmen, the gravity of the situation and the inevitable result of cessation of work,   AH the responsible people in the Revolutionary Party, which is now tho most moderate party, have quite realized the necessity for instant action.     They were unable however to take the necessary steps, because the Social Democratic party, were so powerful that it was impossible to apply pressure to thorn. The situation has now improved and work generally has been restarted to-day.   The men have obtained better conditions and shorter hoursc    I do not&quot;know at present if this will mean that the Factories arc not at work for 22 hours as previously.      I shall keep In touch with the situation and urge them to increase the output in every possible way, so as to make up for lost time,,Two Powder. Factories at Ochta near Petrograde are still closed down but they also will open&apos; up in a day or two,As regards 2.       I am very concerned at the situation.    Themen-have&apos;completely taken charge and the Officers appear to have no control whatever. I hear from Tsarskoe Selo that work of a sort has been carried out today, and it is hoped that it will be in full swing again by &quot;the end of the month.One difficulty arises here which has not yet been decided.   It ic as follows..... The DUMA has decided that men who took part in tho Revolution arc not to be sent to the front. The Artillery men at Tsarckoe Selo arc affected bv this order, as they took part in the Revolution.   Ao all our new Hows go to T.S.and arc manned by these men, it would.seem that under this rule they can never be used away
from Petrograde. Ban probably get uuover this difficulty by getting the men to volunteer, but I am hot raising the question until work is in full swing again. I have hoard of one battery commander who was deposed by his battery, but otherwise the Officers are still with th^ir men,   I think it may probably turn out that the discipline in the Artillery is a little better than that of the Infantry here.GENERAL. Ac regards the changes in the Government, I thinkif the Government manages to consolidate itself and remainin power, that our position will be improved.     Mr. Gutchkoff,the new Minister of War is a fairly strong,businesslike manand impresses me favourably.     I have had several Intcrviewcwith him and have told him frankly that the Artillery Situationwas most unsatisfactory and required drastic changes.-   Ipointed out that tho long delays in equipping and despatchingto the front the guns which we and the French were sendingout, was making a very bad impression in England and thatI hoped that under the new Regime we should arrive at ahappier state of affairs.     He took a note of all the pointsI raised and promised me that ho would use every effort toexpedite matters, not only in the question of transport byRailway but also in equipping and despatching to the front.I think he will certainly use more forceful methods than hiepredecessor.Other changes are,,., Genl, Liehovitch-becomes Chief of Artillery at Pctrograde vice Gcnl. Manikoffski who goes to t he Mi ni s t r y of Far:.Genl. Lichovitch is full of technical knowledge but rather lacks the &quot;drive&quot; which is so necessary to expedite the equipment of batteries for. the front.,    I have had a long interview with him and he has promised me-that he will take -in hand all the points which I raised..W F;^:^^ ::-.:;4&apos;A;&apos;C&apos;^(Signed) F.
