(Memorandum from the First&apos;Sea Lord of the Admiralty to the Shipping Controller, dated let April 1917)Our present experience of the German attack on shipping indicates the desirability of;a review of our Mercantile building policy.It is, of course, well known that large ships are much more easily attacked by torpedoes than smaller ships, provided the -speed of the larger ship is no greater,. and it is also evident that our losses in cargo are very much greater if.a large ship is sunk than vould be the case If it were a smaller ship.Both these arguments indicate the extreme desirability of revising our building programme of standard cargo vessels in the direction of substituting for Classes (A) and (B) vessele of the (G) and (D) Glassesj   and it is proposed that the disadvantage of the increase of personnel required by the use of the smaller ships in larger numbers should he accepted, and that all vessels of the (A) and (B) classes not already ordered should have substituted for them an equivalent tonnage in vessels of the (0) and (D) Classes.(Intd)      J\R.
