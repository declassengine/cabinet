LORD MILFEJR stated that the object of the meeting vaa to eon-aider the programme drawn up &quot;by the Munitions Suh-Ooiamiasion of the recent Cojaferenee of the Allies at Petro$ra&amp;, and to consider any difficulties or suggestions which the v**rious Government . Depart-msnts concerned thought it desirable to raise before the prognamme araa submitted to the decision of the War Cabinet,said that as far as the supply of the munitions and material was concerned he supported the programs as it stoodi subject to a definition of the tyj-.ee of mechanical transport in lieu of a gross demand in tonnage.   He stated that the goods would be there according to the programme, with the ijossible exception of some of the railway material ivhieh might have to be obtained from North America, and subject to the fulfilment by the Shilling. Controller of the delivery of iron ore,MAJOB-CtEJJEHAL PURSE stated on behalf of the T?ar Office that it might plan out that considerable sacrifices might have to be made in the &quot;BM if not in the &quot;A&quot; programme of requirements by the British Army in Prance, if the Russian heavy howitzer demands were to be met.     He urged the importance of the intor-depe$denee of hov/itsers and aeroplanes, pointing out that the heavy howitzers were really useless without the necessary aeroplane observation and support.     He hoped that the relative value of the supply of howitsere, 6 inch and over, to forces in France and forces in Russia would be carefully weighed by the War Cabinet before a decision was come to,glMgAL SIBHPffY HMQjg attached great importance to the delivery of the heavy howitzers ana expressed his vievj that the priority of Russian needs consisted in (1) trench mortars, (...) aeroplanes, and (o) heavy guns.The question of &amp;sM*C of delivery arose at this stage, MAJOR-G EH IRA L CALLWSLL pointing out that the last ship-load&apos; to Port Romanoff&apos; from this country ftould take place next week and that after this little or nothing in the way of aeroplanes or guns could be shipped until the opening of the Port of Archangel, The opening of the Port of Archangel was considered to berths first week in dune,MAJOJMjIWE PAL PUB8B   raised the question of the replacements promised In paragraph 3, page 3, part E, of Mr.Laytonfs report, and strongly urged the addition of some words such as &quot;as far us possible&quot;, und pointed out that it was unlikely that we should be able to fulfil the demand as it stands.MAJOR-GaKgHAL gPggg   raised several other points of detail in connection .vith the programme outlined in part 5 of Mr, uayton1 a report, but all these wre met by the Minister of Munitions, who .;. guvs an undertaking that he Gould carry out the programme. For instance, the question of machine guns sr&amp;s raised, General Purse pointing out that as the number of men in France decreased the number of machine guns must be proportionately increased,LIEUT.-GHH2BAL 01R  AVID ESIBIBBOH read a telegram containing a further iurgg, demand recently received from Russia for machine guns for aeroplanes, and both LORD MILIBB and BR.ADDISOI? urged the necessity, both on principle and in detail, of pointing out to Russia that the programme submitted represented the absolute maximum that either tonnage or production would permit of being fulfilled.     With regard to the aeroplane demands, LI;tUT.-GENERAL SIR DAVID HEUDEBKOI said that we could supply some of the 800 aeroplanes demanded without engines, but that if the demand for 800 aeroplane engines tsere persisted in a very serious consideration must arise as to whether such un issue to Russia would not vitally affect our early supremacy on the Western front.
SIR DAVID HENDERSON pointed out that Russia was already obtaining a very large share of a big order for 8,000 aeroplane engines placed In France, and that we should not commit ourselves to the promise of a further 800 aeroplane   engines until the opening of the Port of Archangel, on the grounds that -(1)   Shipment by Romanoff or deliveries from Romanoff tc Moscow are so uncertain and that aeroplane material would be more or less inevitably damaged in transit by this route under present conditions; and (2) By the time Archangel is opened we shall be In a better position to judge of the requirements in France and ean then and only then pledge ourselves to any considerable issue in Russia.He stated that a certain number of aeroplanes complete belonging to a previous programme were still undelivered owing to transitory difficulties, and that these aeroplanes were ready for delivery to Russia as soon as the transport difficulty could be improved.    He stated that neither the pilots nor the mechanics in Russia were up to the standard required for flying the new fighting machines, and that he would personally rather send 2 squadrons complete with British personnel than a number of valuable aero-plane engines to Russia where they might not be used or, if used, would be soon out of action.With regard to increasing the supply of aeroplane engines in this country, DE. A DDI SOB pointed out that the only way this could be done would be by diverting labour and shops now engaged upon the production of mechanical transport engines into * the aero-plane engine manufacture, and that this constituted an additional reason for ascertaining at the earliest possible moment the exact demands in type of the mechanical transport required by the Russian Government, in addition to that required and expected from Italy and Prance.LORD MILKER stated that Mr.Valentine had seciired control of the aviation school at Moscow, and that he hoped thereby to improve the quality both of Russian pilots and mechanics if the machines could be delivered.MB. GRAMS -THOMSON, representing the Shipping Controller, said that the shipping position was most serious and he feared that there&apos; might be some necessary percentage reduction of the programme, i statement was being prepared of the exact position in regard to shipping, which should be ready for the War Cabinet at the end of this week, and the point would have to be raised as to whether we -should curtail the already reduced Russian demands or deprive our-selves of certain imports which had hitherto been regarded as of vital necessity.     The deliveries to the interior from Port Romanoff showed a slight improvement, but nothing that really signified, the record deliveries from the port to the interior being that of last week, viz.  ,000 tons in the 7 days.DK.ADDISON proposed that an Inter-Departmental Committee be appointed by the Cabinet -(1) for the carrying out of whatever programme the Cabinet decided upon; and(2) to decide upon any modifications of such programme as may subsequently arise.MR.GRAEME THOMSON, MH.LAY110N, and MR.KOTES, the last speaking on behalf of the treasury, urgently supported this proposal.MB.LAIT01 pointed out that the Russian demand for aeroplanes was reuiiy a damand for aeroplane engines, the Russians being able themselves to make the aeroplanes but not the aeroplane engines.
2?he two former hoped that this Committee would decide upon questions of priority.    It was stated that at present priority was left entirely to the Russian authorities ana that it was important that there should be some body in this country who could consider these questions of priority, and if necessary, refer them back to Russia.LORD MILftJSR welcomed the idea of 1&amp;e Committee and stated that he considered it absolutely necessary that a permanent committee representing all Departments concerned should be established as a Court of Appeal in carrying out the programme, the Departments which he considered should be represented being1. Havy.S. Army.3. Munitions.4.   Shipping.5. Treasury.6.   Commission Internationale de Iteritaillement.(Under the circumstances it was thought that the Air Board might be represented by the Ministry of Munitions unless exceptional circumstances arose when doubtless the Ministry of Munitions would communicate with Lieut.-General Sir David Henderson.)The Meeting then considered the organisation to be set up in Russia and it was decided that this should be referred to the proposed permanent committee.
