A.B. 153/9.. . AIR   BOARD.Report to the Cabinet.31st March, 1917.evelopment I.     The decision of the Cabinet with regard ton Organ!sa-the functions of the Air Board made no specific reference to the system under which Kite Balloons should be provided.     Although coming within the category of Lighter-than-Mr craft, their use is common both to the Navy and Army and some measure of co-ordination as regards their supply is consequently desirable.     An arrangement has now been arrived at between the Admiralty and the War Office, in which the Air Board have acquiesced, by whioh a joint Kite Balloon Section has been formed of Naval and Military officers, responsible directly to the Admiralty and to the War Office, to deal both with the design of Kite Balloons and their accessories and with opera- /.tions involving their use.     Inasmuch as this Section will deal partly with operations it will not be under the Air Board and it will send direct to the Control-ler of Aeronautical Supplies requisitions for material of a kind common to the two Services.II.     The Air Board have had under consideration the constitution aiid functions of the British Aviation Commission in Paris, which has hitherto acted as agent for the Naval and Military Air Depart-ments for obtaining supplies of aeronautical material in France.     Under the new organisation this Commis-sion will come under the Cor&quot;roller of Aeronautical
Supplies.     Its direction will be in the hands of a Naval Officer, Colonel Courtney, who has hitherto been a Member of it.     In view of the importance of retaining a connection between the Commission and the British Embassy in Paris, the Commission will have as President, Captain Acton, R.N., the Naval Attache.     The Commission will deal, under the Con-troller of Aeronautical Supplies,&apos;with all orders placed with contractors in France for the supply of material and accessories.     As regards, however, applications to the French Government for the cession, of aviation material belonging to that Government, It has been found advisable to arrange that General Trenchard, Commanding the Royal Buying Corps In France, should deal direct with the French General Head-quarters.     The actual control of the disposal of the French supplies of aircraft allotted by the French Government to the French Front rests with the French General Headquarters and in view of the excellent relations prevailing between the British and the French Air Services, General Trenohard is frequently in a position to obtain supplies by direct personal application when an official request to the War Office In Paris would prove unavailing.     When General Trenchard has ascertained what cessions of material can be obtained, the Air Board will be informed and the official--application through the British Aviation Commission in Paris will follow.General III.   The Board have had under consideration thePolicy.allocation to the Naval and Military Flying Services of the Rolls-Royce 250 h,p. engines which are likely to be produced during the period March to June.  -- 2 -
%.n view of the limited supply&apos; of these engines and the fact that they are the only type suitable for certain specific purposes, including airships (rigid and non-rigid), certain large seaplanes and our most valuable fighter reconnaissance machines, this allocation presented great difficulty and importance. The facts of the case and the conclusion arrived at by the President of the Air Board are set forth in the extract of the Board1s Minutes appended hereto.The deliveries of engines and aeroplanes to date have been as follows:-Total for Total for Total for Total for week to      March     February   February 24th March-, to date.     1917.__1916.,Engines 219 627 507 184Aeroplanes       166 541 575 215In addition to the above 38 aeroplanes and 8 sea-planes have been delivered during the week on Admiralty contracts.(Signed) H.P.HAROT,Secretary to the Air Board.

The Boa^jremmiodj-the &quot;&quot;oJ-s-coussijon^^4h.e-allocation of Rolls-Royce engines to the R.If.iU U^ r and the        0.Commodore Paine put in a statement shewing the number of seaplanes and aeroplanes requiring the 250 h.p. Rolls-Royce engine, which were likely to be available by the end of June, to the following effect:-Machines a Engines requireguLarge Americas.................. 15 30wight converted................ 9 9Por-te Boats.................... 7 21Pairey Campania................ 0 _8&quot;68.    iEROPL/JES.Be Kavilland 4................. 24 .     24Handley-Page................. 15 30AIRSHIPS:.;I&apos;l a S *    type    ....C.O.O.CO .09-.

Kote:*Commcdore Paine subsequently informed the Board that a further ro caction of 5 might ^e effected.As tliis balance left a dafloiaacynojf 30 as compared with the Military requirements of 190, Commodore Paine proposed to reduce the $8we&amp;-x&amp;qy jma&amp;ab&amp;* for spares by 3.5, if the Army would reduce their require-ments by the saae-manber, i*e., from 190 to 175*   The allocation of the engines in stock at the Vfoite City,, rim 30, and of those delivered ainoe the 1st Maxoii and to be delivered to the end of June, viz: 260, would thus.....&quot;      ^------ . . t     ,ise as followsTo the R.N.A.S.....................115To the H.F.C......,................. 175This proposal met witli general aooeptanoeo      It was however found that it did not take into account the following requirements for Rigid and II.S. Airships -*10 for Hos. 28 and 30,16 far Nos. 31 and 32,SO already allocated to Rigid Airships and in hand at the Rolls-Riyce &quot;$arks,24 for N.S. type, Total - 80 Rigid Airships.As regards these items, Commodore Paine subse-quently intimated that a reduction of 12 would probably be* *effected as they would not be needed, he expected, until after June, leaving the additional requirement of 68.* The Board discussed the possibility of making good this deficiency, and attention was drawn to the fact that in respect of 75 Rolls-Royce engines in
commission in the R.H*,:i. 3, there were 130 in works, transit and repair; als&amp; that the R,H.A,S, already had 12 Handley-Page machines in commission.   Attention was further drawn to the large number of high-power Sunbeam engines in stock at the White Oity*   These, however, were declared to be unsuitable for the machines now in question,     The suggestion was also made that Colonel Or Gorman should be asked to enquire as to any stock of high-powered engines there might be in   Italy.i       Finally the President expressed the opinion that It ivould be necessary to ask the R,H.A*S, to forego the ZA engines proposed for the de Havilland 4 aeroplanes and the 30 engines proposed for the Handley-Page aeroplanes and to ask the 3.I.C, to make good the remainder of the deficiency, viz: 14,     The allocation of the 290 engines would accordingly be as followsTo the   R.N.A.S................... 115Plus Airships................,   68183Less aeroplanes.............,     54129 -To the R.P. 0................,.....175Less B..*....................     14jL 6 -1*Commodore Paine expressed his readiness in the circumstances to abandon the De Havilland 4 aeroplanes but protested strongly against the proposal that the R.H.A. S. should surrender the Handley-Page machines.       The
Admiralty attached great importance to their employment at Zeebrugge against submarine craft.      He desired that it should be placed on record that the orders placed with Messrs, Rolls-Royce by the Admiralty specially contem-plated their employment in the large seaplanes and the Kandley^Page machines.     He reminded the Board that it had been arranged that the R.E.C should participate in these orders to the extent of 27$, but had in fact received 48$,    During the month of March, of 69 engines delivered, 53 had gone to the R.E.C. and 16 to the Admiralty,     It could not be said that the Admiralty1 s attitude in the matter had been unreasonable^     He pointed out further that the Handley-Page machines in question were in part constructed and that their disposal if there wero no engines for them would present diffi-culty,^ne President requested Commodore Paine and General Henderson to go again through the lists of engines under re pair, in depots, etc, as ho was hopeful that some of the deficiency might be made good by drawing thereon for the time being,* * *
