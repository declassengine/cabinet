Your 52017.I hope you //ill assure the War Cabinet that I appreciate most ___________fully the importance of the operations in this theatre,&apos; and from the moment of my arrival in Egypt have never failed to do so. Of this, in my o minion, the work of the Egyptian Expedition-/  :  . &apos;&apos;,   d . ;&apos;.&apos;      ...   ;. ) yw&apos;&apos;&apos;/da-. :-da - &apos;]&apos;/y.    ; ,   a   ..    , ay&apos;\ - : &apos;d     ad,.,     .: -     \ary force affords sufficient proof.

In the course of the last fifteen months rny sole idea has been to push on the railway with the utmost rapidity, with a view to invasion of the enemy&apos;s territory, and in order to bring him to battle  as early as possible.    I do not think that a single d/y in the course of the last 18 months has been wasted, nor do I think that greater energy could be displayed than is being done at the present moment.   Last August I was at Roman!.   Now, seven months later, I am with an army at the gates of Gaza, -irich represents an advance of 110 miles over completely desert country, destitute of food, water, shelter, roads or- communi cat ions of any kind,    Every man and gun available together with the necessary supplies of ammunition, etc&apos;,., are being pushed to the front, and the rail-way is strained to its. utmost limit,   /all preparations are in progress for an attack on Gaza and should be completed With-in the next 16 days,    I am especially anxious not to hurry over this operation, as I have now induced tlie enemy to col-lect a considerable force In front of mo, and I feel that with s properly and. methodically prepared attack there is a good chance of bringing about a considerable success.    I in-tend, naturally after capture of Gaza to continue the invasion of Palestine as rapidly as may be permitted by the progress of my railway.   I havo, however, at present only sufficient rail-way aatsri&apos;1 to take me to Deir el Bel all, i.e., to within about eiyht males of Gaza,  and the next consignment only left India yesterday,    I should bo glad if the necessary railway material to he me to Jaffa could bo expedited.    I have decided to take thej. ... i...
railway along the ooast tc Jaffa, and not to link up with tho Beeroheba line, aa I oonoider it sound from a military standpoint to ktep my left flank on the sea, and because the experts point out following difficulties in linking up with the existing BEERSHEBA line.. 1. Break of gauge.2s Capacity of narrow gauge would prove totally inadequate,5. In order to connect our standard gauge with BEERSHEBA line-j approximately 18 miles, would &quot;be almost certain to necessitate gradients of over 1 in 100, by whioh carrying capacity would be materially reduced,4, To lay standard line on existing formation level would, for the same reason, be useless,,     By keeping close to the coast, it is hoped to avoid any gradients over 1 in 100, and oo maintain carrying capacity, which even now &quot;barely meets my daily requirements.   My railway proposals., are, accordingly, to extend the standard gauge railway Gaza towards JAFFA, following the. line of the coast.     Furthermore, as the lines of communication extend, it will be essential, in all probability,  to double the line from KANTARA to Gazai as the capacity of a single line constructed under war conditions to maintain my force boyond that point seems exceedingly doubtful*With regard to the troops at my disposal, I have, as you know, willingly given my best to France, Meaopo-tamia. and Salonica,   Although the numbers which, are now at my disposal are not what I have asked for, I realise fully that no more are available at present, as a result of requirements of other theatres.     If my force is kept up to full establishment by reinforcements, I have every hope of conducting a successful campaign in Palestine., provided the enemy is not heavily reinforced.    I must point out, however, that the following &apos; deficiencies require immediately to be made up, in addition to the detailed demands contained in my G.S*&amp;*/67.. February 27th, and G.S.Z./27, March 12th, to whioh I would again draw particular attention;1. The mechanical transport asked for in my G.*IMkT*&quot;2686, December 26th, ac modified by my 11603 March 17th, as to despatch of which.1 have as yet no notification, -and which I require mcst
urgently.g,      I still considor my A.S.C. drivers insufficicnt, see my 0 ,&apos;M.Q.T. 3127, :&apos;larch 20th,   Thls nccosc11ateo dilution. w ith an excessive number of native drivers, who, in contact vrith the enemy, prove unreliable,.   Proportion of A.S.O. to native drivers should not bo less than half and half,   A considerable number of animals is required for trains and ammunition columns, and none arc in sights   Shortage of veterinary &quot;officers is&quot;a serious matter, which may,&quot; I hope, receive attention.     ,Oj     1:ith regard to artillery, in addition to my requirements for two new divisions as stated in my A.L,1739, Harch 30th, and A.M. 1750, March Slot, I,should be alad of an additional Siege Battery, two 6&quot; Howitzers, and two 8&quot; Howitzers, as I shall probab-ly have to attack a number of strongly fortified positions against which more weight of metal would bo cf groat value,   I am satisfied, as regards ammunition, provided always that the -oresent scale can be constantly maintained.4. As regards Signal Units, my L. of 0. Signal Company has recently extended its sphere to large degree, and very urgently requires increasing, whieh cannot all be provided from loeal sources. Under this heading detailed requirements are being telegraphed separately. It will also be of great assistance if outstanding indents for signal and telegraph material may bo met quickly, and shipments duo as iar as possible accelerated.5.     I also urgently require to provide for increased needs of greatly extended L, of C, at least one additional Army Troops Company6,     I have already wired, see my A.H,1745, March 31st, that I am in urgent need of ten aeroplanes of the newest type, which will enable mo to cope successfully with enemy&apos;s Halberstadt machine.I do not wish in any way to create difficulties. I shall certainly overcome, any which may exist,   but I do want you to   undor-s t and
stand clearly that I and my troops are doing and will continue to do cur utmost to bring about some decisive result in Palestine.     If our progress should appear slow, you will realise,  I am sure, that this is inev-itable,   Everyone here Is stretched to the utmost, and to call upon them for further effort would only give rise to discouragement, and would be like spurring a willing horse,Finally, as paragraphs 1 and 4 of your telegram above referred to might be read to mean that the War-Cabinet considered there had been a lack In the conduct of my operations hitherto, and that I neeu to be spurred on, I would, respectfully request that it may be reassured On this point.   , I feel sure that the members will fcrgivo me if this telegram shows me to be over-sensitive, or if I have read into the wording views which wore net intended.
