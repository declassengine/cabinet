SECRET4WAR GAB&quot; HERECRUITING ArD CONSCRIPTION IN IRELAND (COpy of letter to Sir William.Robertson from Sir Bryan Mahon)The Royal Hospital DGBLIM.My dear Robertson, &apos;     5th April 1917f Re your speech of yesterday and the necessityfor more, men I really think that the Government ought to consithe possibility of getting men from Ireland again. I am, arid have always been of opinion that Conscription cpuld be   -, carried out and with very much less difficulty than people thinfe But now that America has come into the Tar there is an oppor-&apos;  unity which ought to be taken advantage of.   I think you will, find thej\e will be an Increase in recruiting now but.hot enough to &quot;do any g-ood.But if it was known for certain in this country that if people did not join the Army voluntarily up to a certain date after that date compulsory service would be put In force in my opinion It would get a great many men, and I believe that&apos; giving them the option of coming voluntarily would have a good effectv America comin.fr in must influence the Irish.     I hope you will forgive my bothering you but it is worth consideration and suggesting to the Cabinet.- 1 do not think that we would want more troops any how ^ one or two brigades of cavalry or yeomanry would be all.,Yours very sincerely, L (Sgd) BRYAM MAHOIi.
