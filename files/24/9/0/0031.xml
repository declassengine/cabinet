3 -B C R 33 T1683IHKIHG 01? HOSPITAL SHIPS.     QUHSTIOI-! OF REPRISALS(Letter dated 29th March,. 1917 from Sir Robert   Borden to the Prime Minister)Lear Mr.Lloyd George, .I feel it my duty to express, to you my. feeling of disquietude at the situation which may develop if the suggested methods of reprisal with regard to attacks on hospital ships should ho followed,. Upon the wider question as to whether reprisals ere in any.,case desirable I- do not propose to enter. There maybe cases in which reprisals will henecessary and each case must -he -determined upon the attendant circumstances. We cannot, of course, compete with the Germans in their general policy . of ruthlossness and terrorism^With respect to-matters now under consideration/ I am gravely apprehensive that the proposed methods may place us in a position difficult, if not impossible, to defend.     If we should place our wounded upon transports that cannot he regarded as hospital ships within the-usage and conventions of international law, and if we place -on hoard the same ships German prisoners, what will our position be? -   As the transports are not hospital ships in any legitimate sense, and as they will hear no outward indication that they are being used for the conveyance of the wounded, how can we expect that they will not he attacked?     Tho situation would he ver?/ much the same as if we should place German prisoners on hoard all our transports.     Can we doubt that in such case savage   r reprisals- on the part of the   Germans would result;   and would there not be a plausible contention that we had created a situation which invited reprisals of some sort.     It might be that the counter reprisals thus resulting would be undefensible; but it would seem that our course could be plausibly urged as having invited them.     If we are to place prisoners on board, I think the ships should preserve their character as hospital ships&apos;, should be so distinguished by the usual indications and should, whenever possible, he escorted.Faithfully yours,(Sgd.) R.L.Borden.The Rt. Hon. Lavid Lloyd George, Downing Street, S.V7.
