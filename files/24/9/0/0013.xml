The tctal demands put forward by Russia amount, with existing orders, to some 15 million tons of material.- Both the capacity of the ports and the available .tonnage rendered anything like this amount out of the question,&quot;and the sub-Oommission calculated&apos;the total amount which could be sent at 3,400,000 tons.     Adding to this a 25% margin for contingencies, the supply programme was therefore based upon 4-g- million tons during the year 1917, and therefore about one third of the demands put forward by Russia are included in the programme. The British share may be briefly summarised as follows;-( a)    H e avy Ar t i 11 e ry ,4 batteries of 6 Inch Howitzers ) Per month for2 batteries of 8 inch Howitzers ) six months from1 battery of 9.2 inch Howitzers ) the opening of) Archangel.) (viz . June 1st.(A total of 168 pieces.) - ,(b) 50   4,5 Howitzers during 1917 needed to replacelosses .(c) Guns outstanding from previous programme alreadyauthoris ed.nil 4.5 inch Howitzers16 6     inch Howitzers40 8     inch Howitzers15 9.2 inch Howitzers(d) . In addition to the above,  during the winter 1917 to1918, the British Government will replace guns and howitzers of the types ceded by It which have been put out of action.     These replacements are estimated by Mr. Layton of the Ministry of Munitions to amount to:-    .7 8 4.5 inch Howitzers 4 6 inch Howitzers 6 8 inch Howitzers 2   9.2 inch HowitzersThe calculation being passed on previous experience.(e) Ammunition for above.100   rounds per gun per week for 6 inch howitzers 75   rounds per gun per week for 8 inch and 9,2.howitzerTrench Mortars .

Aviation Material .     As many aeroplanes as possible up to a maximum of 800(Note.     Lieut.- General Sir David Henderson states that we can supply some aeroplanes without engines, &quot;but that the difficulty of providing engines is great.    He also points out that the transport difficulties via Port Romanoff are so great that aeroplane material might easily be damaged in transit and he suggests that the delivery of aeroplanes,even-those already ordered and promised, be not commenced until the opening of Archangel, by which time the British Government will be in  -a better position to estimate the needs of . aeroplane material on the western Front . kajor-General Furze urges in this connection the interdependence of the heavy artillery and aeroplanes.)Prop ell ant .   30.000 tons in all for 1917 of uhich about &quot;&quot;17 thousand tons . remain to bo ordered.Railway MaterialM&quot;    100,000 tons of rolling stock, and&quot;&quot;200,000 tons of rails for delivery in&apos;tlio last quarter of 1917 and beginning of 1918.
