J*D. Hazen, Minister J        Office, of Marine and Fisheries and cf the Naval Service, Canada.Lord Curzon recapitulated the action that had been taken in the past and pointed out to tho Committee that, cn the 31st January, 1917 (W.C. 60. Minute 5.) the War Cabinet decided that the German Government should.be informed (a) that tho British Government denied the allegation that in several instances cur1 hospital ships had been misused for the transport of munitions and troops, and (b) if the German threats were.carried out immediate reprisals would be made.     This was&apos;done.Lord Cur son further recapitulated the&apos;&apos;conclusions of his previous Committee (W,C. 57, Appendix III) to the effect thatthe German Government should&apos;be informed that as soonone ofour Hospital Ships had been attacked, arrangements would be made for the embarkation in each   Hospital Ship of a certain number of German Officers and men, that for the present Hospital Ships should be treated in respect of marks and lights as here-tofore, but that in the event of Germany continuing to attack and sink Hospital Ships in spite of these reprisals, they should be armed and disguised and should travel under escort at night -which recommendations wero approved by the War Geb inet on Cth February, 1917, with instructions to the Admiralty aid the Director of Priso ners of War to make the necessary arrangements as soon as   a hospital ship had been attacked.     Since then the matter had been twice before the Imperial War Cabinet.     On the first occasion tho decision of the War Cabinet, above reported, had been confirmed;   but on the second occasion, in consequence of more recent information, it had been held in suspense pending a renewed reference to the present Committee.
The Committee considered the matter at length, particularly be&amp;ring In mind the facts (a) that the Hospital Ship T,&apos;ST.ANDREW&quot;&quot; passed in bread daylight, on 25th March, at a distance of one. mile inside the threatened zone, an enemy submarine, which deliber-ate ly. refrained from attacking; -(b) that an average of ia7 Hospital Ships cross the&apos; Channel to Havre d?ily - increasing to 3   after heavy fighting;    (c) that an average of two Hospital Ships proceed to Calais and a similar number to Boulogne, daily, under ordinary conditions? being increased to three to each pert after heavy fighting;    (dj that tho   Hospital Ships in both those categories have so far gone to and fro with impunity;    (e) that the Admiralty cennot undertake to provide escorts for Hospital Ships if armed end disguised; &quot; (f) that the Germans might extend ana carry out their threat to Hospital Ships in any and every theatre of war;- - (g)that if the proposed form of British reprisal was adopted, the  emeus might retaliate by placing British Officers on board their own submarines, and that in any form of competitive retaliation they would be sure to win -and they thought there was a presumption in favour of treating the case of the &quot;ASTURIAS&quot;, In the absence of further evidence to the contrary, as en isolated instance of German brutality which might not necessarily be repeated.     In these circumstances they were almost unanimously of opinion that the War Cabinet decisions as to the particular form of reprisals should be suspended for the present.     In tho event of renewed attacks the matter might have to be reconsidered.The Committee then proceeded&apos; to discuss other possible forms cf reprisals, and the bombing of undefended towns across the German frontier from France was advocated by some of the members as being the most effective and practicable method. It was pointed out, however, that we had turned over to tho French practically all our bombing aeroplanes in that quarter, and had withdrawn the pilots for service on our own front, and there might be difficulty&apos;in persuading the French to carry out reprisals on our account.     The First So a lord undertook to procure further information en this point.Upon the question of making any further pronouncement on the matter,&apos;in repudiation&apos;of the false charges -which continue to he circulated&apos;by the German Government, Lord Robert Cecil was asked&apos; to.consider the desirability&apos;of communicating the fscts relative both to the sinking cf the &quot;ASTURIAS&quot; and to tho actual policy and procedure of the British Government either to tho King of Spain or to the- Queen cf-Holland-with a view to their making known the facts of the case and attempting to dissuade the Gorman Government from any&apos; further barbarities of this description,-&apos;    Proposed telegram is shown in Appendix I.The Committee were informed, however, that, before July 1916, cases had occurred of the use of our Hospital Ships not strictly in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Convention, inasmuch as the vessels had been used for- the conveyance abroad of Rod Cross stores, hutments, material&apos;and tents for temporary hospitals, as well as the transfer of doctors end/hospital attendants;&apos;  although as rep;ards the&apos;&apos; personnel, the numbers carried had never been in excess of the medical complement of the ship,- as a Hospital Ship.     In such cases it might be argued that we had used our Hospital Ships in lieu of transports for the conveyance of medical staff and medical stores.-    On the other hand we had never used Hospital Ships, as alleged by Germany, for transporting munitions aid troops.-Any communications that might be made on the lines suggested should be in conformity with the above presentation of the facts
AEPEEDIZ I.^ a 4.     &apos;       4.. (Sir A. Ear dingoProposed telegram to ( 0(mnt dQ SaligThe torpedoing of the Hospital Ship Asturias by the Germans may have &quot;been an isolated atrocity or it may have &quot;been tho first of a series of similar actions.     In the latter oase a very serious situation will arise.     We have already said that we must mete reprisals and having said so we must carry out our threat,     But if there wore no likelihood of a $ repetition of the offence the reprisals need not be of a very serious character.     If however it is to be repeated we could not pass it over without strong action and indeed public opinion here would not allow us to do so,     That may probably lead to retaliation by the Germans and that in turn to further acts of severity by ourselves.     Such proceedings will greatly embitter a contest which has already roused the most violent emotions and may load to events which will not be forgotten or forgiven for generations.     You should make a communication to (His Holiness(The King of Spain in this sense and ask whether it would be possible for him to. intervene so as to prevent this fresh calamity to humanity.As for the allegation made by the Germans that our Hospital Ships are used for the trasnport. of troops or munitions that is absolutely uirorua-     and we are ready to give assurances to that effect in any form desired or to submit to any neutral inspection which would not impede the use of the ships for the carriage of the wounded.     But we must point out that if the.Germans really have doubts on this subject they can easily satisfy themselves by the exercise of their undoubted right of visit and search.(Initialled) R.G.
