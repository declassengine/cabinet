i.B, 153/10.K^ORT TO, TKE OABIIffnT.  -7th April, 1917.C-encral 1.     The Board have had under consideration, inPolicy.addition to a number of matters of minor importance which it is unnecessary to report, the question of the policy to be followed with regard to the manufacture of Rolls-Royce engines for the Aircraft programmetof 1918.The two types of Rolls-Royce engine most in uso in the Royal $aval Air Service and the Royal Plying Corps are the 190 h,p. and the 250 h,p.     The design of both these engines has now been improved with the result that they will givo respectively 260 and 350 horse power. The output of the firm is at present about 25 per woex, and it is hoped to raise it within the next 3 er 4 months to 40 engines a week and possibly more.     The quent^n tft be answered is whether this output will suffice to meet the requirements of the Army and tfavy or &quot;mother the manu-facture of the engines should also be entrusted to somo other firm to supplement the output of Kessrs. Rolls-Rtyce, As regards the larger of these two engines - tho 350 h.p. -there is no doubt that it will be required for seaplanes. As regards airships, inasmuch as economy of weight is not of such vital importance, an engine of somewhat more sub-* stantial construotion and greater reliability would no doubt be preferable, but it is doubtful whether the number(
required for airships will he sufficiently large to justify the design and manufacture of a special engine for the purpose. The point is under consideration.     If it should he decided to &quot;build a special engine, the liaybach engine captured in one of the Zeppelins will probably be used as a model.     If no &apos; special engine is built, the 350 h.p. Rolls-Royce, run at 300 h.p, will, it is believed, prove satisfactory.     This engine will also be required in certain quantities for aero-planes;    the precise numbers needed are now being determined,, The need for the smaller engine (260 h.p.) is less clear.     We have four types of 200 h.p. engine coming for-ward, some of which will develope considerably more than 200 h.p.     The weight of the Eispano-Suiza, which, at a high number of revolutions, developes 245 h.p., is 520 lbs., whereas the 260 h,p. Rolls-Ilcyce weighs 710,     This is a marked disadvantage on the side of the Rolls-Royce engine and unless the new 200 h.p, engines now in their experimental stage should not fulfil expectations, it seems improbable that there will be much occasion for its use.     It is, however, a proved engine of long life and it is desirable to keep it as a reserve,On the abovo basis the Board will shortly be in a position to determine whether liessrs, Rolls-Royce&apos;s own output will suffice to meet tho requirements of the two Air Services in 1918 for their special type of engine.Supply, 11.     The deliveries of engines and aeroplanes to date
have- &quot;been as follows:-Total for     Total for   Total for   Total for week to        March to     3? oh ruary     February 31st March, date. 1917. 1916.200 035 507 152109 730 575 &quot; 215In addition to the above, 16 seaplanes have been delivered during the week ending 31st March.The general situation as regards supply is shewing a marked improvement in certain directions.     It is noteworthy that there has been a total increase in the Works complements of 65 of our most important firms of appr 03 i rnately 7,000 hands during the first two months of the current year, or an increase of nearly 10%,Supplies of steel are easier and the supply of the small metal parts has been much improved by standardi-sation and the successful efforts of the Controller of Aeronautical Supplios to increase sources of production. One of the chief difficulties which has not yet been overcome is tho scarcity of suitable ball bearings.Engines Aeroplanes
