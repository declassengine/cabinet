With reference? to Mr. Thomsons letter of the 30th ultimo, I am directed by tho Shipping Controller to report, for tho information of the War Cabinet, as follows Merchant Shipbuilding*Progress in merchant shipbuilding has been delayed by bad weather and in some measure by heavy repair work.   In some districts thero has been a slight improvement in the delivery of material, but on the whole there is still an insufficient supply.   The total amount of wages paid during the last week amounted to  287,803 of which  73261, or 25$ was paid on merchant work.   Six munitions certificates were issued, making the total number of standard ships certified 86., and the total unmoor ordered 120. Purchase of Tonnage abroad.With regard to the purchase of ships building abroad, the position is as follows:-.CONTRAOTS SIGNED CONTRACTS CLOSEDomm outNo. of ships.1593726Tons d.w. capacity.914,800296/870156,710222     1,368,380Approximate Price. 33,514,36011,618,4105,798,543 50,931,313Included in the abave figures are the following, negotiated in Canada through the Imp, orial Munitions Board:&apos;Approximate tond d*wa capacity.89,800No. of ships.Approximate PriceCONTRACTS SIOHED CONTRACTS CLOSED OFFERS OUT15 4 313,600 8,85022112,250 2,977,686 562,477 334,596 3,874,759Sec re tar-War&apos; Cabinet.

This is in addition to 43,000,000 dollars already expended;   of Kr. 10,000,000 providod in Norway for a similar purpose, practically tho whole has been expended during the week.   A further credit of ; . \ Kr. 10,000,000 has been arranged by the Treasury. Requisition of Liners.In accordance with tho policy laid down by the War Cabinet the process of requisitioning all available British tonnage is being carried out as rapidly as possible and substantial progress has now boon made with the organisation of the liner services under t&quot;e rr-v: donditions.
toApproximately the following may be taken to represent the numbers of ships engaged in the Far Bast (Straits, China and Japan) Australasian (Australia and New Zealand) and Indian Trades before tho War, and in February, 1917, the withdrawals recently provided for and numbers remaining and the percentage redaction which these numbers reflect in the ships now engaged in these trades -Trade Approximate number   Withdrawals Bemaining      Per Centof vessels -employed reductionin on     on Feb.1913 Feb. 1917 1913     1917,Far East 100 60 18 42      58 ;      30j Australasian    105 68 13 55      4%      20iIndian 150 111 18 93      38)       16$In addition to the above, 10 vessels have been withdrawn from the trade between North and South America and 4 are under notice to withdraw from tho South African trade. This trade $ a3 well as the oross trades, notably the trades between the United States and Ports in the Umpire,,are still being explored with a view to further1 withdrawals, but in these and indeed in the case of every trade, Oonsiderable caution has to be observed not to reduce the tonnage below the volume necessary for the convoyanco of ossontials, which cannot bo derived from a nearer point of origin.It is important to note also that account is to be taken, not only of tho reduction in the number of steamers, but of the reduction in the carrying capacity of the remaining steamers owing to the abnormal delays of one kind and another due to War conditions.This obtains in every case, but notably of course, in those trades which have sufforod diversion via the Cape.   In the Indian Trade, for instance, this causo superadded to the othors ha3&apos; resulted in an increaso of tho period of transit by roughly 50/.In
In addition to the above, the ordinary full requisition has resulted in the. introduction.Trom other sources into the North Atlantic Trade of a furthor 7 steamers? so that the aggregate supplement in deadweight tonnage in the North Atlantic Trade, which has already or will shortly take place, may be summarised as follows:-d.w.Prom Far East Trade.........   18 steamers aoout 155,000 tonsAustralasian Trade.....   13     11 &quot;    108,000    &quot;Indian Trade...........   18     tt *    152,000N. &amp; 3. American Trade.   10     M 60,000South African Trade,...    4     11 n     23,000    *?Full Requisition.......    7     rt 11     60,000    &quot;558,000    11It should further he remarked that some 30 coastal and short trado steamers have been withdrawn from the services of t!   Indo-C&amp;ina and China Navigation Companies in the Eastern Soas.  These boats are intended to serve the Mesopotamia Expedition and thus release by substitution ocean-going tonnago already engaged in that service, which will pro tanto be available for North Atlantic tonnage.The withdrawals included in the foregoing statement may not in every case be permanent, e.g. in the Australasian Trade the permanence of withdrawal will depend upon the quantity of meat available for shipment in shorter trades, such as the Plato and the quantity of home fed meat used for consumption.It is doubtful, whether we can prudently apply much more rigour to the treatment of the main United Kingdom/Foreign Trades, until the estimates now in course of preparation of essential imports, which must necessarily be drawn from the countries which they serve, are completed.Withdrawals beyond this point in the case of the cross trades outside the War area will be possible, the extont of suchdepending
?   depending on the amount: of Neutral chartered tonnago we can obtain in substitution.As regards exports, withdrawals have already resulted in much congestion of goods waiting shipment both in the Indian and Far last Trades.    Grave apprehension of finan-* cial difficulties has been expressed by tho Cotton Exporters and strong representations made both by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and private firm-as to the ombarassment from which they are suffering.Similarly, Mr. Massey, the Premier of New Zealand, protested vehemently at the Conference held last Saturday at the Ministry of Shipping, against the withdrawal of Australasian Insulated tonnago on the score of injury to Now Zealand Meat Exporters.The following are the trade groups into which the Liners have been divided for the purpose of the Kequisitioning Scheme.0?hey are 29 in number and of these 20 have already been made subject to its provisions.Those which still remain to bo dealt with are of minor character, and indeed, in some cases almost negligible, -o.g. Australia to China and Japan, Australia to San Francisco, Singapore to Westralia.The Blue Star Line are refrigerated boats already under requisition to the Board of Trade.Thes8 groups will wherever possible bo consolidated into largor groups, but it is doubtful whether tho number of Committee of management, which are in the process of.being set up, will amount to less than 20.

Ships have had to be diverted with consequent wasto of tonnage and loss of essential supplies.   But after considerable negotiation a settlement which it is hoped will prove satisfactory has at last been arrived at.British Ships in Baltic.Negotiations have been proceeding with a view to securing the release of these ships (which, including thoso in Russian ports,,number 59) when the ice breaks.  A favourable issue is now in prospect.Iflpnry
Enemy Ships in South American Ports.The question of taking action in concert with the United States and other Allies to secure the release of these vessels or as many of them as possible deserves prompt eonsidora-tionConference with representatives of Dominions.A conferenco took place at this office on the 31stultimo at which tho following Ministers from the Overseasdominions attendedGeneral Smuts South AfricaSir Bobert Borden, G.O.M.G.
