IMPERIAL WAR COUNCIL.Memorandum on the Military Assistance given by the Ruling Chiefs of India in the prosecution of the War.Statement by the Secretary of State, Oth September 1914.The Secretary of State for India (Lord Crewe) was able, as early as 9th September 1-914, to make a statement of the magnificent evidence of the loyalty of the Ruling Chiefs of India to their King and to the Empire, in the House of Lords. In this he said that the Rulers of the Indian Native Native States, numbering nearly 700 altogether, had with one accord rallied to the defence of the Empire and had offered to the King their personal services and the resources of their States.As regards personal services, the Chiefs of Bikaner, Kishangarh, Rutlam, Sir Pertab Singh of Jodhpur, and several other Chiefs have actually been employed in the field in France or elsewhere. Many others, anxious to join, have been prevented by various causes -from leaving their States.Imperial Service Troops.Lord Crewe announced on the same occasion that there are 27 States in India that maintain Imperial Service Troops, and that the services of all these troops had been placed immediately at the disposal of the Viceroy, and that contingents had been accepted from 12 States. All the 27 States have now furnished contingents, either to actual theatres of war, or to assist in keeping watch and ward on our Indian frontier, or to fill up our internal garrisons and thus enable other units to proceed on active service. It is usual for States to pa.y only &quot; normal &quot; charges when these troops are actively employed hy the Imperial Government, but .1:1 is Highness the Nizam has insisted upon, paying all charges in connection with his troops. Several Ruling Princes have increased the establishment of- their Imperial 1 Service Troops since the outbreak of war. A notable instance is the addition by His Highness the Maharaja of Bikanir of three companies to his Camel Corps. This regiment has done invaluable service on both frontiers of Egypt from October 1914 to the present day.The total strength of Imperial Service Troops now employed, as describedabove, is as follows :  	Cavalry -	-    3,350Camel Corps    -        -	840Infantry	-    6,100Sappers	-      480Artillery             -	120Transport	-    1,270Signallers (say)	.100	12,260Nepal Durbar.The Independent State of Nepal placed the whole of their military resources at the disposal of the British Government in August 1914, and 10 battalions of their Gurkhas have been, and are now, employed in our garrisons in Northern India, and. have enabled a corresponding number ofms 391
our own regiments to proceed to the war.
