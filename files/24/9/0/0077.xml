From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 26th March 1917. ; (Repeated to Sir P. Cox.)Secret. Your telegram of the .17th March. Civil Administration of Bagdad. Although paramouut direct British administration may not be contemplated it seems essential that apart from martial law which can merely maintain order steps should be taken to overhaul and replace defunct Turkish administration and to carry on work of civil Departments. For this purpose we understand suitable Arab personnel is not immediately available, and that onus must fall for the time being at any rate on British Officers.The immediate requirements appear to be  (1) To secure submission by political means of tribes between Kut-el-Amara and our front line and later between Kut-el-Amara and Nasiriyah and settle them on accustomed lands on revenue paying basis. Latter is of course mostly in Basra A^iWet, but we mention it to show full requirements.(2) To overhaul and replace civil Departments of Vilayet of Bagdad.For (1) a few military Assistant Political Officers will be required and we propose to send such suitable Officers- as are available from India. We have already sent Major Bailey of Political Department. May we use our discretion up to, say, eight more Officers ? For (2) an experienced Revenue Officer with a staff of two or three Officers acquainted with Arabic and if possible Turkish are required. If Dobbs is willing to return to Mesopotamia, and his health admits, we propose to send him. If not we propose Holme of Political Department. One or two Officers from Egypt or London would be useful in this capacity.Further we propose to send Holland on completion of Trade Report to Basra as Cox&apos;s deputy, Wilson moving up to Bagdad in similar capacity.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,30th March 1917.(Repeated to Sir P. Cox, Bagdad.)Secret. Your secret telegram of the 26th March. Civil administration of Bagdad. Please refer to my telegram dated 29th instant for general statement of intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government. You may appoint at once four or five Assistant Political Officers. We propose to send also some junior officers chosen from Arabic-speaking staff of Egypt, Soudan or Levant services to fill other political posts and for revenue. We think it desirable also to appoint Judicial Adviser from same source, as we do not wish to introduce Indian code. We are enquiring as to names. We have further had under consideration appointment of a deputy under Cox at Bagdad selected from same source, but should first like to hear his views on this proposal. Our object is to supply Cox with staff familiar with Arabic language and customs, and with Turkish administration and law.Before leaving Dobbs said his doctor advised that his return to Mesopotamia was impossible.
