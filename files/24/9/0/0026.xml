SECEET.0. 1/92/267.Copy No.....!r.ADDENDUM TO NOTE BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF, DATED 12th FEBRUARY, 1916.In the above-mentioned Note I ventured to lay before the War Committee certain suggestions as to the way in which diplomacy might render assistance to naval and military operations, with special reference to the advantages we should gain if Turkey or Bulgaria or both were detached from the Central Powers. The Note was considered by the War Committee on the 22nd February, 1916, when the following conclusions were reached: Having regard to the importance of unity of action in foreign policy, and to the extent of the British contribution to the cause of the Allies, the War Committee accept the view expressed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in his note, dated the 12th February, 1916, that Great Britain should endeavour to obtain the control of the diplomatic war policy of the Allies, subject to the limitation that pressure must not be exerted to a point which might alienate our Allies.In regard to the further views expressed in the Note of the- Chief of the Imperial General Staff, dated the 12th February, 1916, the War Committee agreed to the following :-(a.) The time is not ripe for the Allies to raise the question of a separate peace with Turkey or Bulgaria, but the possibility of some arrangement with these countries should not be lost sight of, if circumstances should become more favourable.(6.) The possibility of bringing Holland into the war on the side of the Allies should not be lost sight of, if and when the military situation may render this advisable and possible.(c.) No immediate diplomatic action is recommended in regard to Scandinavia or the United States. ri2. Since the Note was written many important changes have taken place in the military situation, as well as in many other conditions. I propose to state these, very briefly, and I submit that they are such as to justify a review of the general lines of the policy which should be followed by us with respect both to the enemy Powers and to certain of the Entente Countries.3. Rumania, from whom much assistance was hoped, has proved to be a burden rather than an asset. She has been heavily defeated and her armies have lost much of such fighting value as they had.Russia achieved great successes in Galicia and in Bukowina last year, and, although her further advance was checked by the bringing up of German divisions, it was hoped that the additional guns and munitions which would become available this year would enable her not merely to hold the enemy forces now on her front, but to compel Germany to oppose many more divisions to her; but she is now passing through a period of revolution and chaos which must postpone effective aggressive action for several months, and may indeed prevent her from holding even those enemy divisions which are on her front. In fact her internal situation is still so disturbed that there is at least the chance that she may, for all practical purposes, drop out of the war, either by the action of her Government or by the disintegration of her armies.Germany has, by a supreme effort, formed 74 new divisions during the last 12 months, thus being able to provide a strategic reserve considerably larger than that available last summer, and this fact appears to have had a ^paralysing effect on the Italians. It is quite possible that part of the reserve may be sent against Italy ; but that is no reason why the Italians should already have curled up, as they have, on the defensive and be contemplating the defeat of their country. So far as numbers are concerned it is thought that they will always be superior to any hostile force that is likely to be sent against them.As regards Great Britain, the intensity of the German submarine blockade has(B17/240)   25   3/17   H&amp;B   4338wo
further reduced her shipping, and has to that extent impaired her ability either to maintain her own troops in distant theatres, such as Salonika, or to supply her Allies with necessaries.In France the reserve of man-power has further diminished, while the shortage of coal has had an injurious effect on the life of the people and on the output of the factories.4. It must not, however, be thought that all the changes during the last seven months have been to the disadvantage of the Allies.&apos; That certainly is not the case. The internal condition of Germany has steadily deteriorated ; serious riots are not uncommon ; her railways are feeling the strain of over 2^ years of intense war-traffic ; and there can be no doubt that the want of many of the necessaries of life is reacting prejudicially on the health of the civilian population and to a lesser extent on that of the troops. The revolutionary outbreak in Eussia must also be causing much anxiety to the German Government lest similar outbreaks should occur in Germany. On the Western front the growing strength and efficiency of the British Army and the great increase of the Allied artillery are producing their effect. The recent withdrawal to the Hindenburg line, whatever other intentions may have inspired it, is an indisputable proof of weakness, for had the Germans felt capable of holding the territory they were occupying they certainly would never have relinquished it.The internal situation of Austria has also become worse, and there are many signs of war-weariness and a desire to conclude peace if it were possible to do so on reasonable terms. :In Bulgaria the strain of nearly five years of war is having its effect on the morale both of the civil population and of the army, and the difficulty of finding drafts is increasing. .Of all enemy countries Turkey is the one which has suffered most severely, and the decisive defeat of the 6th Turkish Army at Kut, the capture of Baghdad, and the retreat of the Turkish forces from Persia have put an entirely new aspect on the situation. On the \Egyptian frontier the Turkish 4th Army was a few weeks ago thrown back into Palestine with severe losses, and has just suffered a further and still greater defeat south of Gaza. In the Hedjaz, not merely has all danger to Mecca been removed, but the Turkish hold on Medina itself has become precarious. Syria is a prey to famine, the whole of the Turkish * man-power has been mobilized, the forces in the Caucasus have been reduced, and if it were possible for Russia to take a vigorous offensive whem the snows melt in the Caucasus, as we expected some weeks ago that she would, and still hope that she may, the Turks might soon be swept out of most of their Asiatic possessions, or be compelled to sue for peace.There is a further important point in our favour, and that is the recent rupture of diplomatic relations between the United States of America and Germany, and the-probability of a state of war shortly subsisting between those countries. The effect of this change would be to ease the financial situation, to provide us with more men, and to release British men-of-war. from service in the Atlantic as well as make available a greater amount of shipping.5. On the other hand Russia, Rumania and Italy are undoubtedly very weak points, and I desire to draw the particular attention of the War Cabinet to the fact that it is our Agreements with these same three countries which have hitherto made it impossible to arrange any basis for a separate peace with the weaker members of the. Central Alliance. Our Agreement to hand over Constantinople and the Straits to Russia makes it certain that Turkey must fight on till the bitter end, while Bulgaria cunnot be expected to welcome the presence of Russia in Thrace. Our arrangements with Rumania and Italy whereby all Transylvania and a large part of Hungary are to be ceded to the former, while Istria, Dalmatia and parts of other Austro-Hungarian provinces fall to the latter, make any arrangement with Austria impossible.6. Had Russia, Rumania, and Italy contributed as much to the winning of the war as we had a right to expect, the situation would be far more favourable to us than it now is, and I suggest therefore that our Agreements with these countries, and certainly the one with Rumania, should be reconsidered by the Cabinet. Rumania has done so badly that she ought not to expect to get anything like all she asked for, while Russia might be satisfied with the internationalization of the Straits. The case of Italy is the most difficult to deal with, but unless she puts up a better fight than apparently at present she feels capable of doing, she also ought to be prepared to accept something less than her full demands.7. I realize that there are great objections to my suggestion, and I make it with diffidence because it involves many complicated questions, including the main principles
of our policy with respect, to Germany. These I am not qualified to discuss, nor is it my business to attempt to do so. I do wish, however, definitely to submit to the War Cabinet that the Russian revolution, the Rumaniau debacle, and the Italian want of-energy and courage are placing upon our shoulders a greatly increased burden, and from a military standpoint I am very doubtful whether we can sustain this burden sufficiently long to ensure such a victory as will compel the enemy to cede the territories specified in the existing Agreements. Exactly how great the burden will eventually be it is impossible to say because it depends upon the effort made by the three countries named, but the effort will certainly be much less than we had hoped, and will probably be quite inadequate ever to admit of the specified territories being obtained. In these circumstances I submit that we should no longer allow our hands to be tied to the same extent as before, and that we should secure greater freedom to take advantage of any opportunity that may arise for detaching from the Central Alliance those members of it who may desire peace on reasonable terms.Chief of the Imperial General Staff.20th March, 1917
