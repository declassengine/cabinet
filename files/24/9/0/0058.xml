COPYSECRET- WAR   CABINET.G.T. 356-Intelligence.Prom Colonel Thomson. To     D.M.I.31/3/17G.B. 486.It would appear from latest returns   submitted by Captain Pitts (which will be sent by next bag) that the Bhortage of food stuffs in Roumania has been exaggerated. These latest figures show that in point of fact there is sufficient wheat in Roumania   hands to last until harvesting of next crop, provided the Russians bring in supplies for their own army.     In regard to maize situation is not so good, but in view of fact that there is plenty of maize in Bessarabia the importation of maize should not be difficult, particularly as Russian military authorities appear to be willing and able to make arrange-ments necessary.     Shortage of forage is unfortunately still a serious factor, but as all cavalry division (both Russian and Roumanian) are being evacuated it is hoped that sufficient supplies will be available to last until next crop.Details of stocks immediately available are being sent by bag, but I send you this telegram as I fear you may have received an unduly pessimistic idea of the economic situation in Roumania.
