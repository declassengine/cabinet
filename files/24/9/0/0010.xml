The purpose of the esolution is to secure complete freedom for the Allies after ig Xwx to make such commercial arrangements among themselves t with Neutral countries as they may think advantageous and ;:?odient, without being hampered by the obligation to extend 3 the present Enemy Powers any concessions which they may see it to make to present Allies, or JAeutrals.This particular resolution does not lav down any principles s to the actual treatment.to be accorded to German trade       -&quot;u ythe Allies;    it only prohibits thorn during tne pence or wisition from binding themselves,  either collectively or oparatelv   to sive to Germany and the other Enemy rowers thewnt to such tree1....C ,.\     Laccended, to Allies or neutrals.3 illustrating the necessity of adopting th wn in the resolutionprinciples laidit me pointed, out that the regulation - imports from, and exports to, present enemy countries which &apos;rns th3 subject of Memoranda circulated by the Board of Trade ^11 be impracticable unless the right of most-favoured nation fitment is withheld from enemy countries for a weriod after ?e -,&apos;cr,It need hamIIv be said that the resolution has no directupon inter-Iiwoerial trade relation.length of-o transitional period -t determined by the PthtneIhisoiubien was.s Conference, but left to subsequentweement.&amp;st for five years afte:.It shouldThe original British proposition was thatthe War,&quot;and it is still the -view the Board of Trade that&apos;this is a reasonable period to fix, i-eement could not, - howeverbe obtained at rerls as to any 5offib period, owing mainly te the difflcuiu,y-r.i h-r felt bv the
ofdelegates of Italy and iiussia.     To both/those countries, Germany was prior to the &quot;war, of great importenee as a market for their agricultural products, and their delegates felt thet unless their countries could be assured of adequate componse-tory markets elsewhere after the &apos;7ar, they would not be justified in binding themselves to accord such penal treatment to German trade as would jeopardise their osport- of produce to Germany. It was tc meet these apprehensions that the last paragraph of the resolution (which, formed no part of the original draft) was added...    But even-with this addition agreement could not be obtained to the insertion of any fixed period of years in the resolution.As the Paris resolutions relating to eftor-war trade have not yet been fully aklopted either by Italy or by Russia, there is no present prospect of a general unter-AlliocL agreement as to the period, and it therefore becomes necessary to decide whether the Governments represented at the Imperial Conference are prepared to agree to fivo years, or any other period, either (a) independently of the other Allies, or (b) on condition of agreement with Prance, and possibly Belgium, on a similar period.The treaty arrangements between the British Empire and the present enemy countries before the Var are set out in the Appendix.     All these Treaties have of course now been terminated by the &quot;Var, -
APPENDIX:,There was no Commercial Treaty in Force &quot;between the United Kingdom and Germany, hut all the British Empire other than Canada onjoyed most-favoured-nation treatment in Germany in the oase of Customs duties by virtue of a Law renewed every two years.;Most-favoured-nation treatment was withheld fyf. Germany from Canada from 1898 when the Anglo-German Commercial Treaty of 1865 was terminated by the United Kingdom in consequence of the German contention that the Canadian grant of preferential tariff treat-ment to the United Kingdom conflicted with its provisions, until 1910, when an agreement was made whereby the surtax on German goods imported into Canada was remitted and certain specifie classes of   Canadian goods were admitted into   Germany at the low-est rates of the German tariff. .   The most-favourid-nation treat-ment enjoyed by   Canada in Germany prior to the War was conee-quently restricted to certain specified classes of goods, chiefly agricultural and forestry products.With Austria-Hungary (l) The Treaty of Navigation of 1868 provided for reciprocal national and most-favourednation treatment of British vessels and their cargoes in all:the Austrian Dominions, and of Austro-Hungarian vessels and their cargoes in all British Dominions with the proviso that bAustro-Hungarian ships should be admitted to the coasting trade only of those British Possessions in which the Coasting trade was at that time or should thereafter be open to foreign ships in conformity with local legislation^, and (2) The Treaty of Commerce of 1$76   gave Austria-Hungary most-favoured- nation treatment in all matters of trade and commerce throughout the Eritish Empire.With Bulgaria, the Convention of Commerce, Customs Duties, Navigation and certain additional agreements of 190% extended only to those of the British overseas possessions which specifically acceded to it..(The self-Governing Dominions did not accede).With Turkey, the various arrangements in force beginning with the oapitulation of 1675 were unilateral;    that is to say they impose obligations on Turkey without any corresponding obligations on the United Kingdom.
