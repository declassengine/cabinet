From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1st April 1917. (Received at India Office, 8 a.m., 2nd April.)Secret. Monthly Afghanistan Report. Internal situation remains quiet. There are indications that Nasrulla Khan has been restored to Amir&apos;s favour. I had recently occasion to address Amir regarding Mahsucl dis-turbance and to invite his co-operation in maintaining peace on frontier by restraining his tribesmen from becoming embroiled. On receipt of my message Amir at once issued stringent orders to Governor of Khost, and in his very satisfactory reply to my message emphasised importance of not allowing frontier troubles to become magnified at this juncture.
