NINTH   REPORTOF THEDIRECTOR-GENERAL OE NATIONAL SERVICE TO THEWAR CABINET.In the early part of the year, my attention was directed by tbe Army Council to the necessity of organising the Medical Profession with a view to obtaining an adequate number of Doctors for military purposes without unduly jeopardising the health of the civil population.Voluntary Agencies had been established by the Profession with this object, namely, -first, in Scotland, the Scottish Medical Service Emergency Committee, aided by Local Com-mittees in every district, and, afterwards, in England and Wales, the Central Medical War Committee, co-operating with the Committee of Reference (on London hospitals, &amp;c), also with Local Committees in every district. Before the passing of the Military Service Act, the Scottish Committee and the English Committee, by means of circulars and other appeals in their respec-tive countries, had procured the Voluntary Enrolment of large numbers of medical practitioners prepared in certain circumstances to undertake service. Each Committee acted in concert with the Military Authorities. Very considerable numbers of medical officers were thus obtained for war service.After the passing of the Military Service Act, the English Committee and the Scottish Committee were (each with some slight modification) recognised by Order as statutory Pro-fessional Committees. The Act directs that all men of military age (including medical men) shall be dealt with by Local Tribunals, but prescribes that the latter shall refer all medical men, other than conscientious objectors, to one of the Professional Committees. Each Com-mittee has thus become, in effect, the official Tribunal for registered male practitioners of military age.In connexion with (1) their Voluntary Enrolment schemes, and (2) their function as official Tribunals, the Professional Committees now possess classified Returns and Records showing the relation to military and other public service of nearly all the practitioners in Scotland and of a large, majority of the practitioners in England and Wales.Both Committees have, however, found increasing difficulty in procuring the necessary officers for the Army, and in adjusting the provision for civil practice, under the scheme of Voluntary Enrolment. Accordingly I decided to call a Conference of representatives of these three Committees, together with Sir W. Babtie, V.C., of the Army Medical Service, under the Chairmanship of Sir Donald MacAlister, President of the General Medical Council, to consider what further steps were necessary to meet the present requirements and to make recommenda-tions as to the machinery which it might be desirable to set up. The Conference was held here on the .14th and 15th inst., and its Report, which was agreed to unanimously, is appended. Representatives of the Local Government Board and the National Health Insurance Committee attended the Conference.It will be observed that the recommendations for the organisation of the Medical Profession will entail legislation, and I recommend that I be authorised to take the necessary steps to carry them into effect.The recommendations of the Conference do not cover the Dental Profession, and I thought, it desirable to investigate the situation in regard to Dentists, of whom a very large number have been called up for Service. I understand that the supply of Dentists for Military purposes is ample, but that the needs of the civil population will be endangered unless some organisation is introduced.I therefore asked Sir Donald MacAlister. together with Mr. C. S. Tomes, the Treasurer of the General Medical Council, to confer with a Deputation from the British Dental Association, and a Report of their Meeting and their proposals is also appended.I concur in these proposals, and ask the authority of the War Cabinet to carry them into effect.(Signed)      NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN,Director-General.30th March, 19.17.

Mr. Smith TV hitaker iMr. Hallett, Secretary, Committee of Reference.Mr. giahop Harman j g6cretarieSj Central Medical War Committee.Mr&quot;. Graham, Secretary, Scottish Medical Service Emergency Committee.A.The Conference considered a statement submitted by Surgeon-General Sir Wni. Babtie, V.C., on behalf of the Army Medical Department, setting forth the number of medical practitioners required at the present date (1) to make good the regular wastage of the existing Army Medical Service, and (2) to provide for the necessary expansion of the Service to meet new and urgent demands.Something like 1,000 fresh men for commissioned service were required at once.Statements were submitted on behalf of the three Committees represented at the Conference, showing the steps they had taken and the results they had obtained on the basis of their appeals for voluntary service, and of their procedure as Professional Committees under the Military Service Act to procure a supply of practitioners eligible for commissions in the Medical Service of the Forces.After careful consideration of the situation, it was unanimously agreed to report:   1.   That the time for any further appeals for voluntary service is now past. 2.   That effective provision can no longer be made for the needs of the Forces on the one hand, and of the civil population on the other, without the institution of a system of compulsory medical service for both men and women practitioners.3. That steps for the institution of compulsory medical service&apos; for members of the profession should be taken forthwith, apart from and independently of any measure for the institution of compulsory national service applicable to the civil population in general. ,.b. jp f:M%k   &apos;&apos; -rThe Conference next considered what machinery should be set up for such re-distribution of medical practitioners and such re-organisation of medical services and institutions (briefly, &quot; mobilisation &quot;) as may be necessary in order to liberate the numbers required for the Forces and to provide for the needs of the civil community.Representatives of &quot;the&apos; Government medical services concerned and officers of the three Committees represented were invited to take part in the discussion.After careful consideration, it was unanimously agreed to report, with reference to Central Organisation  &quot; .-4. That the Central Executive for England and Wales and the Central Executive for Scotland should be (as in the case of the Professional Committees under the Military Service Order, 1916) distinct and separate.5. ^ That the Central Executives should consist essentially of members of the medica] profession.(10755.)   Wt. 6430S-275.   75.   3/17.   D &amp; S.   G. 2.
G. That for England and Wales the Central Executive should consist of the Central Medical &quot;War Committee co-operating with the Committee of Reference in the maimei provided by the Military Service Order, 1916; and, for Scotland, of the Medical Service Emergency Committee.7. That the Central Executives should be appointed or recognised by the Director-General of National Service for the purpose of carrying out &quot; mobilisation,&quot; and invested with the necessary powers.8. That provision should be made for the inclusion in each Central Executive of one or more w8men, representative of women practitioners.9. That provision should be made (as under existing arrangements) for the attend-ance at meetings of the Central Executives of representatives of the Government medical services concerned, and for assistance of a legal character when required.10. That for the hearing of appeals by practitioners with reference to &quot; mobilisa-tion &quot; (and also for the hearing of appeals by practitioners with reference to Military Service), the Central Executives (and the Professional Committees) should be empowered to sit in several divisions, each consisting of a quorum, the several divisions having authority to sit simultaneously or at different centres, as might be expedient, and their decisions being issued in the name of the whole body.11. That a small Medical Service Advisory Board for Great Britain, representative of the Central Executives, and including the Chairmen of the three Committees con-stituting these, should be appointed for purposes of consultation with the Director-General of National Service, or his deputy, and that, representatives of the Government medical services concerned should be invited to attend its meetings.12. That a Committee of the Advisory Board, consisting 0f the Chairmen of the three Committees constituting the Central Executives, should be empowered to meet for consultation with the Director-General, or his deputy, in cases of urgency.The Conference thereafter considered the question of Local Organisation for the purpose of &quot; mobilisation.&quot; After hearing statements as to the constitution and activities of the existing Local Professional Committees appointed or recognised, with the approval of the Army Council, under the Military Service (Professional Committees Regulations) Order, 1916, it was unanimously agreed to report 13. That, for purposes of &quot;mobilisation,&quot; the Central Executives should be em-powered to appoint or recognise, with the approval of the Director-General, such Local Professional Committees as they may think necessary.14. That, in view of the new conditions arising out of &apos;&quot;&apos; mobilisation,&quot; it is expedient that an opportunity should forthwith be afforded to all the medical practitioners, in districts covered by the existing Local Professional Committees, to meet for the election or re-election of such Local Committees, and that the Local Committees so elected or re-elected should be eligible for appointment or recognition, subject to the proper approval, by the respective Central Executives (and Professional Committees under the Military Service Order).c.The Conference proceeded to consider, first in Committee, and afterwards in full Conference (Dr. Adams being unavoidably absent), questions relating to financial arrangements.After discussioii.it was unanimously agreed to report:-15. That the remuneration of medical practitioners transferred by direction of a Central Executive for substitute medical service of any kind, other than service under a military authority, should be secured by means of arrangements (as to the allocation of professional fees, &amp;c), approved by the Central Executive concerned, and not by the payment of professional salaries by the State; with the proviso that it may be found necessary to institute a central fund supplemented by State grants, from which the Central Executive might draw in order to make good unavoidable deficiencies of pro-fessional remuneration in individual cases. &apos;16. That the professional remuneration, secured to a medical practitioner, transferred by direction of a Central Executive for whole-time substitute service from his own prac-tice to another practice, should not be less advantageous in its terms than if the prac-titioner had been transferred from his own practice to military service in the Royal Army Medical Corps..17. That such contribution as may be required should be made by the Director-General&apos;s Department towards the necessary administrative expenses of &quot; mobilisation.&quot;The members of the Conference signed the foregoing Report, and passed a vote of thanks to the Chairman, for his services.- DONALD MacALISTER.

17REPORT OF A CONFERENCEwith      : .......OmCERS OF THE BRITISH DENTAL ASSOCIATIONheld at the request of the Director-General of National Service, hy Sir DONALD MACALISTER, President, and Mr. C. S. TOMES, Treasurer, of the General Medical Council, at St. Ermin&apos;s, Westminster, on 15 March, 1917.At tlie request of Mr. Neville Chamberlain, Director-General of National Service  Sin Donald MacAlister, President, and)           ^       , ^  .   -iMr. C. S. Tomes, Treasurer. j of the General Medical Council,received a deputation from the British Dental Association, consisting of  Mr. W. H. Dolamore, President,Mr. Norman G. Bennett, Chairman of Representative Board, Mr. M. P. Hopson, Hon. Treasurer, Mr. F. J. Pearce, Hon. Secretary, at St.&apos;Ermiii&apos;s, Westminster, on Thursday, .15th March, 1917.The deputation stated that the Association had sent the appended circular to 4,500 registered dentists. The Dentists Register for 1917 contains the names of about 5,500 dental practitioners.. Of these, there are 1,400 registered as &quot;in practice in 1878,&quot; who must nearly all be over CO years of age, and many of whom have wholly or partially retired from practice.The circular was not sent to dentists residing outside the United Kingdom, or to non-members of the Association known to be serving with the Forces. It has been ascertained that the whole number of registered dentists on military service is 1,060, of whom about. 300 are combatants.The number of replies to the circular was 3,917: the number of circulars returned marked &quot;gone away&quot; or &quot;deceased&quot; was 60. .The replies give the following results:  2,530 dentists are in civil dental practice : of these1,154 are of military age;2,132 are of &quot; National Service &quot; age (18-61);748 hold civil dental appointments in Naval. Military, or other War hospitals; 1,076 hold dental appointments in civil hospitals.After discussion of the general questions suggested by these figures, it was agreed to submit the following proposals :  (1) That, having regard to the small number of registered dentists now available for civil practice, and to the importance of their professional work in relation to the public health, the Director-General should be asked to authorise tlie issue of an intimation to registered dentists that they are not expected to enrol themselves as volunteers for other forms of National Service.(2) That tlie intimation should preferably be issued through the General Medical Council, as the body charged by law with the administration, of the Dentists Act.(3) That the Director-General should be asked to intimate to the President of the Local Government Board, for the information of the Central Tribunal, that it is inexpedient that any more registered dentists of military age should be called up for other than professional dental service with the Forces.   &quot;(4) That, having regard to the importance of making better provision for the&apos; dental needs of certain sections of the population and of certain localities (such as new Munition centres, &amp;c), the Director-General should be asked to issue to all registered dentists an appeal inviting them to offer themselves voluntarily for professional dental service (whole-time or part-time) where, it may be most required.(5) That provision should be made to protect against serious loss any registered dentist whose offer of professional dental service is accepted.The deputation expressed its willingness, on behalf of the British Dental Association, to give further assistance to the Director-General in formulating a scheme for the organisation of voluntary professional service, by registered dentists, should lie desire it.The members of the deputation, with the Chairman, and Mr. Tomes, appended their initials to the memorandum embodying the above proposals.DONALD MacALISTER, .      &apos; Chairman.16th March, 1917.
