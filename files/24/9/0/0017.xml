Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.From Secretary of State to Viceroy. Army Department, &apos; 2Sth March 1917.3457. Indian representatives, Imperial War Cabinet, want to know what additional effort they can promise on behalf of India on the assumption that whilst doing all we can this year decisive result will not be obtained till next year. The most important consideration is what fighting man-power can you produce and train, to be lit to put into the field in early spring of 1918 in addition to numbers to which you are already committed. This fresh effort would be primarily directed to the relief of British troops now serving in India, Mesopotamia, or Egypt.But you may be able to spare or raise units not suitable for use against Turks.   In that case it might be possible to employ them in France.Do you think you could, for instance, raise 100,000 men for these objects ? I realise that to do so you will have to resort largely to enlistment of classes that have hitherto not been considered the best for providing fighting men. In particular, I wish you to consider whether experiment of Bengali double company might not be largely extended. Consider also particularly the possibility of obtaining more Jats and Mahrattas, but please pass in review all possible resources of India. Present recruiting methods seem capable of considerable improvement, and recruiting organisations would have to be largely expanded. I suggest introduction of some new blood in your recruiting agencies *and much more use than has been made up to date of the authority of ruling Princes and Chiefs in their States, and of our own civil authorities and local magnates in British India. The unofficial classes should also, I think, be called upon to assist. Perhaps some suitable developments of advertisement agency might also be made use of. You will understand that the necessity for exerting the maximum strength of the Empire is so great that every means that can be devised should be employed, and all possible sources of recruitment thoroughly examined afresh. I realise that it may not be possible to make such a large addition to the Army under the conditions on which the Indian soldier now serves. I suggest that you consider whether temporary enlistment for the term of the war might not meet the case; also that as present pay may not be considered sufficiently attractive by classes who have not hitherto provided many fighting men, some form of temporary pay or bonus may be necessary. Please report fully by telegraph what you think could be done. I will then ascertain whether arms and equipment will be available. I assume that you will be able to draw many officers from Territorials now in India, as you will be able to give them nearly a year&apos;s training.
