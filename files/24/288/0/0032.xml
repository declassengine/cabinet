Commrnwealth of Australia is circulated hy direction of the Prime Minister for consideration in connection with Item 1 of the Agenda for to-morrow&quot;&apos; s Meeting of the Cabinet.(Signed)   E.E. BRIDGES. Secretary to the Cabinet.CAB I N E T. COPY NO.THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1, 27th August, 1939.
9 o ^fc) O !*Original Decypher of Telegram from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Prime Minister.Received in Dominions Office on 27th August.MOST IMMEDIATE.I have carefully considered Hitler&apos;s proposals and &quot;make following comments for your consideration accordingly:-Having regard to past experience proposals , should he approached with great suspicion.In particular we should do nothing which would lead Poland to think that we were deserting her as this would not only he a breach of guarantee but disastrous in South East Europe.Hitler should therefore be clearly told that we will not modify our Polish obligation.Subject to foregoing I would make it clear to Hitler that we regarded the merits of Danzig and the Corridor as quite open to argument and that we would use our influence with Poland to procure some form of arbitration or (? detached adjustments) if Germany was prepared to play her party    that we felt that the time was    opportune for a general European settlement which would recognise Germany&apos;s obligations to Italy and ours to Prance and that we welcome his reference to possible future limitation of armament because we felt the present state of affairs must lead to serious economic breakdown in which Germany would suffer as much as any country.
903d u -jI would emphasise that there was amongst all British people a genuine desire for good relations with Germany, hut that this desire was not inconsistent with determination to fight her in what seemed a just cause, although it would he a tragedy if we should fight each believing   his cause to be just when unprejudiced discussion and desire to understand the other man&apos;s point of view might have avoided it.From this point of view a clear statement by Hitler of his aims and desires should if possible be obtained.Nevertheless. I would not dismiss HitlerTs proposals because they are vague and sometimes meaningless.I think it essential that our approach should be liberal and generous so long as it is at our own expense. What I have in mind is that we must not connive at a Polish settlement which would leave Poland at such a disadvantage in future negotiations as to render it probable that her future history would resemble that of Czecho-Slovakia.While suspicion in our own minds is inevitable and proper, I consider endeavours should be made to make Hitler realise that we are taking him seriously and that we are prepared to treat his approach as genuine.     Having regard to the type of man Hitler is, this seems essential.You personally went to Germany to prevent war last September.     Would like to suggest that you invite Hitler to London or to some neutral meeting place and that it be put to him that acceptance of such an invitation would have the following advantages.
6o&apos;i(A) it would tend to break down barriers now being rapidly built up between us and the Germans.(B) it would be the most effective way in which Hitler could demonstrate the reality   of his own peaceful desires.(c)    it would so reduce the European temperature as to render recovery more probable. In reading the cables I have been much struck by what appears to be a real advance in hitler last statement to Henderson over what he said in his letter ta you   two days before.My comments on the above are made with necessarily limited detailed knowledge of the background and circumstances.     Whatever your decision is you may rely upon our loyal co-operation and support and on our appreciation of your great efforts.
