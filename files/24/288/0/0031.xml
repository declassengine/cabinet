COPY HO.     /fjgC A B I IT E T.PURCHASES BY GOvTJRFHENT DEPARTMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.1. I agree in general with the proposals made hy theMinister of Supply in CP. 177(39).  But there is a related matter (Cf. paragraph 7 of the Minister&apos;s Memorandum), which it would he convenient, in my opinion, that my colleagues should consider at the same time. 2. Our recent heavy losses of gold and the fact thatsterling is again a fluctuating currency make it   . imperative to find an immediate solution of the question of purchases of Government Departments involving the use of foreign concurrency.    The lower value of sterling, the great difficulty everyone will meet in acquiring dollars on the market now that the Exchange Equalisation Account is not a seller, and the restrictions we have imposed, and shall impose on market operations should effectively limit private purchases of foreign currencies. But they set no obstacle in the way of purchases abroad by Government Departments, which obtain their exchange from the Bank of England.3. When the present crisis developed I was on thepoint of approaching my colleagues on this subject.    It had already been under discussion in relation to particular types of purchases such as machine tools and
Oi I*J r\6   9raw materials, but it had been handled on a somewhat piecemeal basis, and it was not clear to me that the limited resources we possessed were in fact being devoted to the purchases which ranked highest in priority,,    Unless some orderly procedure is developed there is a great danger that purchases will be made fortuitously by reference merely to t*a ftnMtoB. or partial proposals at particular tfc.es. 4. I am well aware that the extreme pressure of work onall Departments makes it increasingly difficult for them to-find representatives to co-operate in a joint task.    But we can hardly have&apos;a system under which the Treasury would indicate the maximum amount of foreign exchange that can be found in a given period and the Departments would be left to scramble for a share of that sum.    There must be some ordered policy and it must be kept under constant review. 5. I propose therefore to set up a small working committee on the lines of the Treasury Inter-Service Committee with the following tasks:-(l) to approve forthwith new proposals involving the expenditure of money in foreign countries by any Government Department, or if they are unable to approve? to report to me with recommendations;(2) to proceed as speedily as possible in consultation with the Departments concerned to draw up estimates of the requirements in foreign exchange both in the immediate future and over a period of, say, three months ahead.The currencies In respect of which proposals would be considered by the Committee are:-U.S. Dollars. Guilders.Canadian Dollars. Argentine Pesos.Belgas. Swedish Kroner.Swiss Francs. Norwegian Kroner.French Francs.
Treasury Chambers, 27th August, 1959.Reference to the Committee would also &quot;be required, in any case where payment is &quot;being made in sterling for supplies from the countrsr concerned,,    In the present state of the exchanges I doubt whether any purchases by this method will be desirable, but if special cases exist they can be considered on their merits.The Departments to be represented on the Committee should be the Treasury (with representatives of the Bank of England), the Ministry of Supply and the Defence Departments, and the Food (Defence Plans) Department. I do not think it would be necessary to include other Departments except on occasions when proposals affecting them are under review, e0g0, if the Post Office or Office of Works desire to purchase supplies in America, their representatives could attend the meeting at which the proposals were under consideration.6. I have to request very early approval for thisproposal as several applications, some of considerable urgency, for sanctions to proposals involving the use of foreign currencies are already before the Treasury.(initialled)    J.S.
