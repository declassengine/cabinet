F.C.I. 132.jEnclosure to Annex.The German Army-Its Present Strength and Possible Expansion onMobilization.1. Introduction.OUR last paper, C.I.D. No. 1507-B, summarized the information available regarding the strength and organization of the German Army in peace and war as on the 1st January, 1939. :2. Since that date important events have taken place. Czecho-Slovakia has ceased to exist as an independent State, a Protectorate being proclaimed over Bohemia and Moravia, whilst Slovakia was declared independent, though under German protection. What steps the Germans intend to take to consolidate their military position in the Protectorate is not clear; it is probable that additional corps and divisions may be formed for garrisoning this area.3. At the same time considerable stocks of armaments held by the former Czecho-Slovak State have been seized, while its armament industry has passed under the virtual control of the Reich. The effect of these changes is discussed in a later paragraph.4. Personnel.The number of men between the ages of 20 and 45 which would be available on mobilization is now estimated as follows : (i) With the colours ...      ...............      1,200,000Reserve I (men with two or more years&apos; training and under 35 years of age)     ...      ...      ... 1,400,000Reserve II (men who have had only short training and are under 35 years of age) ...      ...      ... 1,400,000Landwehr I (trained men between the ages of 35and 45)    ...............      ... 3,000,000Total     ...      .........      7,000,000(ii) Untrained men     ..................      5,000,000- Grand total     ......      ...  - 12,000,000Out of this total, personnel would have to be provided in war for all three fighting services as well as for agriculture, industry, transport and other essential civil occupations. The figure takes into account the increase due to the annexa-tion of Austria, Czecho-Slovakia and Memel, though it excludes men of Czech race.5. Active Formations and Changes in their Organization.(a) Corps.It is believed that several new corps headquarters are being formed, but exact details have not so far been obtained.The XIX Corps Headquarters, formerly at Vienna, has been moved to Prague.  It is not known what divisions will eventually be allotted to this Corps.(b) Light Divisions.It was stated in C.I.D. Paper No. 1507-B of the 19th January, 1939, that the number of light divisions had been increased from 2 to 5. It has now been established that only 4 exist. There are indications that these divisions, which are strong reconnaissance formations, are likely to be converted into armoured divisions, which are formations of great hitting power. This transformation of light divisions will probably necessitate the creation in their place of reconnaissance units, probably as army troops.
(c) A armoured Divisions.The 10th Armoured Division has been identified in Prague, making six armoured divisions in all.(d) Infantry and Mountain Divisions.There has been no increase in infantry or mountain divisions during the period under review.(e) Frontier Formations.(i) Corps. The   following   frontier   corps   headquarters   have   been established : Western Front.Corps Headquarters &quot; Eifel &quot; at Bonn.Corps Headquarters &quot; Saarpfalz &quot; at Kaiserslautern.Corps Headquarters &quot; Oberrhein &quot;at Baden-Baden.Eastern Front.None identified so far.(ii) Divisions. The following frontier divisions have been established : Western Front.Frontier Division &quot; Trier.&quot; Frontier Division &quot; Sankt Wendel.&quot;Eastern Front.Frontier Division &quot; Kustrin.&quot;They are organized on similar lines to infantry divisions.(f) Anti-aircraft units.The army is now being provided with heavy motorized machine gun battalions on a scale of one battalion per division. Eleven battalions of this type have so far been identified. These units are equipped with thirty-six 2-cm. (-79-inch) AA. machine guns. Though primarily intended for A.A. defence they can also be employed in an A.T. role.(g) Non-divisional units.(i) Motorised machine-gun battalions.In our last paper it was stated that the number of machine-gun battalions had risen from 15 to 20. The additional five have now been identified as belonging to the divisional units mentioned in sub-paragraph (f) above. Consequently there are only 15 independent machine-gun battalions, which are either corps or army troops.(ii) Mountain Artillery Regiments.Two additional mountain artillery regiments have appeared in Austria.It may be the intention to give each mountain division two artillery regiments instead of one, as at present.6. Reserve Formations.The chief factor limiting the expansion of the German Army has hitherto been considered to be the availability of arms and equipment, which was insuffi-cient to equip the resources in reserves of trained man power. Another limiting factor, previously of less weight, has now, however, assumed greater proportions, namely, the supply of officer and non-commissioned-officer cadres, and in future this factor may dictate the rate of expansion.Previously the chief source of supply of officers has been : first, cadet colleges whose combined annual output amounts to 3,000 officers, and secondly ex-officers who served during the war and have been recalled to the colours. This latter source is now drying up. A new source of supply is, however, being tapped by giving commissions to non-commissioned officers.It is probable that each German active division will throw off a reserve division on mobilisation, though this rule may not yet apply to the more recently formed[19680] b 2
divisions. As a result of recent discussions with the French General Staff, it is estimated that the Germans are now able to put into the field immediately on mobilisation some 34-40 reserve divisions, mainly armed on the same scale as the active divisions,7. Landwehr Formations.Similarly, the total number of Landwehr divisions immediately mobilizable on the outbreak of war is now estimated at 32-36. These divisions would be armed on a lower scale than active or reserve divisions, especially in artillery, unless the deficiency were made up by ex-Czech artillery or German artillery of types now obsolete. Their training would also be limited and the personnel composed mainly of the oldest classes, i.e., men between the ages of 35 to 45. These formations would therefore possess a considerably lower fighting value than the active or reserve divisions.8. Armaments.Whatever attempts may have been made during the first half of 1939 to relieve the German economic situation by a reduction in the tempo of military rearmament, they have so far had no noticeable effect upon deliveries of war stores. Orders placed in 1939 are reported from all sides to be in effect as large as those placed in 1938. Many factories turning out armaments are still working at full pressure, and deliveries are in some cases at a slightly higher rate than in the last half of 1938.The industrial capacity of the Ostmark is almost insignificant compared with that of the Old Reich, but is now contributing slightly to the flow of armaments of German types.Prior to the establishment of a Protectorate over Bohemia and Moravia, several Czecho-Slovak factories were working on export orders for armaments for Germany as well as for other foreign countries. Since the events of March ex-Czech industry has been encouraged to continue exporting and, apart from the continued construction for Germany of some heavy artillery of Skoda design at Skodawerke, there is no evidence that ex-Czech industry has been ordered to deliver large quantities of armaments of Czech types to Germany or to take steps to turn over to the manufacture of armaments of German types, although factories are to some extent relieving pressure on German works&apos; by the delivery of forgings and castings.It is estimated, therefore, that, in spite of the continued demands made upon industry by naval and air construction, the export market, the Four-Year Plan, the rehabilitation of the Reichsbahn and other special activities, including in particular the strengthening of fortifications on frontiers, the average rate of output of armaments for the German Army by all available resources is slightly greater than during 1938, and it may now be put at a rate sufficient to arm in the most modern fashion 16-17 divisions per annum. At the same time, the continued intensification of production, the resulting shortage of really skilled labour and the extended use of substitutes has led to a noticeable decrease in the quality of German manufacture which extends to the armament industry.Apart from new manufactures, Germany has seized very large stocks of armament stores from the Czech forces disarmed after March 1939. According to the Czech General Staff, these stocks originally sufficed to arm 40 divisions, but since we have evidence to the effect that some of these armaments had already been disposed of to other countries, and that the Germans did not succeed in seizing the whole of what remained, it is probable that the number of divisions which could be completely armed from Czech equipment is considerably less than 40.There is, however, for the present no evidence that German divisions are, in fact, being equipped from this source of supply.9. Fortifications.During the period under review work on fortifications on the western and eastern frontiers has been continued : (i) Western Front (Westwall).The Siegfried Line now extends from Cleves on the Dutch frontier to Basle on the Swiss frontier. The sector from Aachen to saarbrucken appears to be the most strongly fortified. There are, in addition, a number of subsidiary fortified lines and fortified areas, especially about dusseldorf, Frankfurt and Karlsruhe.
(ii) Eastern Front (Ostwall).The main  sectors are :  Schneidemiihl,  which  is  a  fortified  area; Schwerin-Fraustadt; Beuthen-Gleiwitz.These defences are not as strong as their counterparts in the west.In general it may be said that the German system of fortifications is based on field works held by small garrisons of 10-12 men located in pill-boxes, as opposed to the French system which includes great underground works holding large garrisons. These pill-boxes are armed with machine guns, anti-tank and field guns and are protected by barbed wire and tank obstacles. There are, however, extensive subterranean works in places where the ground lends itself to their establishment.There is little doubt that these fortifications will permit of the setting free of considerable numbers of field units for offensive purposes and, regarded in this light, they are an additional strength equivalent to many divisions.10. Para-military organizations.The permanently embodied S.S. (Schutzstaffel) have recently been given armament and equipment similar to that of active infantry units, i.e., rifles, machine guns, mortars, light and heavy infantry guns. They are fully motorized and include in addition armoured-car, motor-cyclist and machine-gun units.There are at the present time permanently embodied S.S. units amounting to the equivalent of : Infantry regiments      ...       ...      \..       ..., 4Engineer battalion      ...       ...       ...       ... 1Signal unit      ....      ...      ....      ...      ... 1There is also a permanently embodied S.A. (Sturmabteilung) unit of 7 battalions which, however, comes under the air force.11. Conclusions.(a) The situation in July 1939 in regard to the number of formations available in peace and on mobilization can be summarized as follows :  ,Peace Strength  Army Commands Corps Headquarters ...Frontier Corps Head-quartersInfantry Divisions, of which four are motorized   ...Mountain Divisions ...Armoured Divisions ...Light DivisionsFrontier DivisionsJ an. 1939. 61939 3 5 5J uly 1939. 6 1939 3 6 4Increase.1-1(decrease)Remarks.XIX Corps H.Q. from Vienna to Prague.Figure for January 1939 should have been 4.

Paper No. 1571-B.)(Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 345th Meeting, Minute (4).)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries, covering a Report prepared by the War Office in collaboration with the Industrial Intelligence Centre on the German Army (C.I.D. Paper No. 1571-B).SIR QUINTIN HILL, Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Industrial Number of Intelligence in Foreign Countries, said that the conclusions of the Report were ^^ns summarised in paragraph 9.   They showed that Germany could immediately   lvIsl0ns-mobilise a total of 120-130 divisions, but of these only 80 would have a full complement of artillery.    The remaining divisions would also be short of transport.LORD CHATFIELD referred to the reported decrease in the quality of Quality of German manufacture, and quoted from paragraph 8 of the Report as follows   German.        A 1       o    i i. manufacture.&apos;&apos; At the same time, the continued intensification of production, the resulting shortage of really skilled labour and the extended use of substitutes has led to a noticeable decrease in the quality of German manufacture which extends to the armament industry.&quot;He asked what evidence there was behind this statement.Mr. MORTON said that he had received a large number of reports on the inferior quality of German manufacture. For example, 150 lorries which were recently delivered to Yugoslavia by road developed serious mechanical troubles on the way. Again, British importers told him that they were refusing German goods owing to bad materials and manufacture. Further, information had been received from a very secret source that the Turks had refused delivery of 3 troopships built in Germany, as not up to specification; this refusal had &quot;been accepted by the Germans.[19718-11]
German Mk. BURGIN concurred, and said that he was informed that nearly all themachme tools. Q.erman- machine tools more recently delivered to us had developed some defect orother, usually in the quality of the metal used.  It was reasonable to suppose thatsuch defects extended to other goods.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : To remit the Memorandum on the German Army (C.I.D. Paper No. 1571-B), together with the minutes of the discussion in the Committee of Imperial Defence, to the Cabinet for information.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1, July 27, 1939.
