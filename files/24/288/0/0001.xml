(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S E C R E T*CP.  151 (39), COPY NO. j^CAB I N E T. COMMITTEE ON THE REFUGEE PROBLEM.INTERIM REPORT.1.      At their Meeting on January 18th, 1939,  (Cabinet 1(39) Conclusion 5) the Cabinet had under consideration the Refugee problem, and agreed:-&quot;That a Cabinet Committee should be set up, composed as under -The Secretary of State for Home Affairs(Chairman), The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and the Colonies, The President of the Board of Trade, The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, ForeignOffice,The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofLabour,to keep under review questions arising out of the Refugee problem and to report when necessary to the Cabinet.&quot;2.     The work of the Evian Conference is being continued by a Committee known as the London Inter-Governmental Committee for Refugees (or the Evian Committee), which includes representatives of all the Governments which took part in the Evian Conference.      The Paymaster-General is Chairman of this body, whose Director is Sir Herbertl4VH^k^p       Emerson.      The next meetings of the Inter-governmental committee are to be held in London on July 19th and 20th.
The object of our present.JJat.ex.im R.eport....is to obtain Cabinet decisions as to the nature of the statement to be made by the Paymaster-General at those meetings, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.3.       It will be convenient first to consider the position as regards refugees now receiving temporary maintenance in the United Kingdom.     Some 4-0,000 refugees have been admitted to this country, the majority of whom are transmigrants, that is to say, persons admitted on the strength of a guarantee that the cost of their maintenance will not fall on public funds, and that they will eventually be emigrated overseas without public expense.      The majority of guarantees have been given by, or obtained through, the voluntary organisations represented on the Joint Consultative Committee for Refugees (formerly the Co-ordinating Committee for Refugees),     We have been informed on good authority that the funds of the organisations concerned have been strained to the utmost.-     The Society of Friends, for instance, have informed us that their resources are insufficient to provide for the eventual emigration of all the refugees now in this country in respect of whom they have given or obtained guarantees.     The position of the German Jewish Aid Committee is understood to be similar.4*       This position has not developed through any laclc of good faith on the part of the guarantors.      The main reason for the deterioration of the position is the fact that emigration of the refugees in question has
been delayed, through no fault of the guarantors or of the British Government.     Vviiile the guarantees which have been, given will probably ensure their maintenance for some months to come, the position will be serious if a large number haTe not been emigrated by the end of that period.      They cannot be repatriated to their countries of origin, and   will presumably have to be supported from British public funds if scandal   is to be avoided.5.       The position in other European countries represented on the Evian Committee is not dissimilar. Large refugee camps have been established in Holland, Belgium, France and Switzerland, and a difficult situation will arise if these camps are not cleared within a reasonable period.      The Governments of these countries are alive to the possibilities, and the Belgian Government have already made representations to His Majestyrs Government.6.       There is a prospect that unless private charitycan be induced by some fresh impetus to provide furtherfunds for emigrating refugees, both here and abroad,to countries of final settlement, the refugee problem will become completely insoluble.      In that event theBritish Government would be faced with an acuts darestLc problem.7. Such a situation would have obviousand unfortunate effects for the mass of Jewish refugeesstill in Germany.     In particular it would prejudice the arrangement concluded between Sir Herbert Emerson&apos;spredecessor (Dr. Rublee) and Herr Wohlthat (represent-ing the German Government), whereby, subject to asatisfactory outflow of refugees from Germany, a Trust
o0Fund is to be established within Germany,  in which will be held 25 per cent,  of the value of the remaining Jewish property in Germany,      Under this arrangement the proceeds of the Trust Fund are to be available to finance the emigration of refugees.      Herr Wohlthat made it clear to Sir Herbert Emerson that the Trust Fund is unlikely to be set up unless more substantial progress is made outside Germany in the near future.      There would then be a danger of the control over refugee policy in Germany, at present in the hands of moderate elements, reverting to the extremist elements responsible for previous outrages.8. We should explain that the arrangement mentioned inthe last paragraph is not an agreement between the German authorities and the London Inter-Governmental Committee, but represents a unilateral offer by Germany.      We estimate, if good will were shown by Germany, that the Trust Fund could make a substantial contribution to the finance of refugee settlement, by supplying capital goods for refugee settlements, and equipment for refugee emigrants and settlers.9. The immediate problem is concerned with the refugeesNwithin the ambit of the Evian Committee, but the Cabinet should be aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed in addition to give sympathetic consideration at any time to proposals by Poland and Roumania on behalf of Jews resident in those countries, with a view to their emigration. Assistance in this respect to these countries is conditioned by a solution of the problem of the Evian refugees.     This pledge was given to M. Beck during his visit in April, 1939 P  and was published in a press communique (see CP.  83(39), page 20).
D10.      We have under examination a scheme for the finance of refugee settlement, prepared by Mr. Lionel Rothschild, and submitted by him to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.      Briefly,  the scheme contemplates the raising of an international fund in the principal countries represented on the Evian Committee, the. first issue to be equivalent to  20 millions, of which  5 millions would be raised in London,     No interest would be paid on the loan, but the capital would be repaid with a low premium by drawings after an initial period.      The whole of the capital would be repaid if possible by the end of the 40th year after issue.      One quarter of the amount raised would be invested in Government or other approved securities of the countries in which particular sections of the loan were floated.      The first issue would not be offered to the public in this country without the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and we suggest that this approval should be given in terms, however,ifcnat would make it abundantly clear that His Majesty sGovern-ment are -recammding     it, not as an investment, but as worthy of charitable support.      Such a fund would be applied, together with the produce of the Trust Fund within Germany, to making recoverable advances for the benefit of proceeding overseas, whether to schemes of group or mass settlement or to situations and enterprises in existing coi^nmunities.      The financial burden of relief and maintenance pending emigration would continue to &apos; rest on private bodies and individuals, and the loan would not be available for that purpose.
llo      iVe understand that I.Ir0 Lionel RothscIaild.,aad the other representatives of British Jewry associated with him incline to think:   that the issue would fail if it were not supported by Government participation. They propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government should participate on a   for   basis0      They do not contemplate participation by the British Government alone, but by all or the majority of the Governments represented on the Evian Committee^      In each case the basis would be that the Government concerned undertook to subscribe one unit for every unit put up in their country by private Individuals^120     So far as American Jewry is concerned (of which two representatives are now in London) we understand that they hold even more firmly than British Jev/ry that no private money will be forthcoming for settlement schemes unless Government participation is assured,, The income of the principal American refugee body is pledged for several years aheads      In this connection it is material that British Jewry has hitherto been depending on American support for the experimental settlement in British GuianaQ      Such an experiment was recommended by the joint Commission of Enquiry into the possibilities of settlement In the hinterland of British Guiana which went out there following His Majesty&apos;s Governments offer to make land availablec In view of the publicity given to the offer and to the Commission&apos;s Report, it is desirable, even on grounds of prestige alone, that the experiment should not be still-born for lack of supporto
13.        Decisions of principle as to British Government participation are required &quot;before the meetings of the Inter-Governmental Committee on 19th and 20th July. There is less urgency in our view in arriving at detailed decisions as to the extent and manner of such participation.      If Government participation is decided upon in principle, we should propose to deal in a later Report with the subsidiary questions that will arise.14.        It may be convenient at this stage to set out what appear to us to be the main objections to the principle of Government participation -(i) We put first the general financial stringency, Y/hich precludes consideration of any further burden on the British taxpayer except on urgent grounds.(ii) The probable reluctance of other Governments, with the exception perhaps of America and one or two Scandinavian countries, to follow our lead in this matter.      Government participation would be a reversal of the unanimous decision of the Evian Conference in July 1958 not to give direct financial aid to refugees.(iii) The great improbability,  judging by experience in Empire settlement,  of an economic return:      it should, however, be added that the Rothschild plan would give priority to the Government subscriptions over private subscriptions in this respect.
1 9JL fJ(iv) The probable unwillingness of public opinion to see this claim upon the public purse preferred to the competing, and in some respects superior,  claims of British nationals at home and in the Empire, for example, the claims of Newfoundland and of the overcrowded West Indies.      (It is particularly relevant to point out that Government assistance to persons in the United Kingdom who desire to settle in other parts of the Empire is at present virtually limited to grants to meet part of the cost of the journey;      there is no provision for grants or loans of capital to help a British migrant to establish himself on arrival overseas and to this extent it is likely that the present proposals would lend themselves to the criticism that they result in more favourable treatment being given to foreign refugees than to British migrants.      This is likely to be seized on by those in this country who constantly advocate the expenditure of very large sums by His Majesty1s Government on development and British settlement schemes in the Dominions).(v) The Parliamentary problem, since to under-take liabilities extending beyond the current financial year would require legislation, and in any case Parliamentary approval of the new policy would be necessary,  since it would involve expenditure which would have to be voted.
15.       A further consideration to he borne in mind is that there is at present no assurance that room will be found in countries of settlement oversea for the increased absorption of refugees.     Acceptance of financial responsibility by the United kingdom Government might lend colour to the belief that it is within the power of that Government to ensure settlement oversea somewhere within the boundaries of the British Empire,      The Colonial Empire, taken by itself, could not in any case absorb more than a limited, number of the refugees concerned, and admission into the Dominions is a matter within the control of the Governments of those Dominiensc16,       On trie other hand, the case for financial assistance rests as has been explained above on the probable breakdown which would result without it. As already.dy indicated,  in such circumstances it is by no means unlikely that public funds would have to be expended on the maintenance of refugees, except in so far as the problem could be met by relaxing the restrictions upon their employment.      Such expenditure would be nugatory, whereas assistance to emigrants affords some -orospect of making them self-supporting. The contribution from Germany would not then be forth-coming, and the refugee problem would remain to exacerbate the general political situation.      i/hile it is probably true that the investment will fail to show an economic return,  it is also the case,  so far as settlement in the Colonial Empire is concerned, that private funds will be assisting to develop our own Colonies,
i 4JL J 17.     Although the Rothschild plan contemplates that the first instalment of the loan will he  20 million or its equivalent, repeated in subsequent years, the schemes for group settlement at present in hand would not appear to involve an expenditure of more than  1 million in the first twelve months:    and after allowing for advances to individual emigrants to openings overseas (generally called &quot;infiltration&quot;) it seems reasonable to suppose that the amount required to be put up by His Majesty&apos;s Government might be limited to considerably less than  1 million during the current financial year018.     We feel strongly that it would be wrong to take any action which suggested that this country ought to carry the major responsibility for the solution of the refugee problem, and for that reason we think that the details of any assistance to refugees should not be settled until the reactions of other Governments are known.     On the other hand, we recognise that it is useless -to expect that all the Governments represented on the Svian Committee will be prepared to co-operate:    and our. tentative conclusion is that the only country whose co-operation in this respect is essential is the United States of America. A lead must, however, be given at the meeting of the Evian Committee, in view of the gravity of the situation in this country.19.      In these circumstances we think that, if the question of financial participation by Governments is to be re-opened, the Paymaster-General1s statement to
the Inter-Governmental Committee on the 19th or 20th July should, after describing the financial situation of the refugee bodies, lead to the observation that His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the conclusion,   -in face of these facts, that unless the work of the Committee is to be abortive and the countries of refuge to be saddled with unabsorbed transmigrants, it will be necessary to depart from the principle agreed unanimously at Evian, that no participating Government would give direct financial assistance to refugees.     &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are, for their part, examining the manner and extent to v/hich private subscription to an international fund to assist in defraying the expenses of overseas emigration of refugees might be encouraged by Government participation, possibly on a basis proportionate to the amount of private subscription, and I would earnestly invite my colleagues to lay these considerations before their Governments and to communicate their views to me without delay*     If other Governments are prepared to agree to this change of principle, and to co-operate in such participation, His Majesty!s Government in the United Kingdom will take the initiative in proposing a scheme for the purpose, which I will circulate in the Autumn,,0-11-
i o20.       The question for consideration by the Cabinet is whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should maintain the existing policy of not participating financially in the expenses of refugee settlement and emigration,  or should indicate their willingness to depart from that policy, and participate on a basis proportionate to the amount of private subscription, if other Governments agree and are prepared to do.likewise.If it is decided to adopt the latter alternative, then we would suggest that the Paymaster-General should make a statement at the forthcoming meetings of the London Inter-Govermnental Committee for Refugees on the lines proposed in paragraph 19 above;    that Parliament should be informed of the substance of this statement at the same time by means of Question and Answer;    and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should at the same time also inform Mr. Lionel Rothschild to the same effect.If it Is decided to adopt the former alternative, Mr. Lionel Rothschild&apos;s plan can only be commended as an object for charitable support.(Signed on behalf of the Committee )SAMUEL IIOARE.
