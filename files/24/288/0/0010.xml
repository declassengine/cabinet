(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJE3TY1S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.CABINET.DEFENCE BILL AND REGULATIONS.REPORT OF CABINET COMMITTEE.1.     We were appointed by the Cabinet on the 5th July, 1939, ,\ to consider the detailed arrangements for giving effect to the decision reached by the Cabinet on the 17th May, 1939f that Defence Regulations should be held ready for issue before an actual outbreak of war, if necessary   in advance of the passing of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill.     We have examined this matter with the assistance of the War Legislation Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and have the following recommendations to make.Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill.2.      We recommend that the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill should be held in readiness in the form of the draft attached as Appendix I to this Report, and that it should be introduced and passed through Parliament simultaneously with, or as soon as possible after, the first issue of Defence Regulations.Nature of Action in advance of Statutory Authority. 3.     We consider that if emergency action by the Executive became necessary before Parliament had passed the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill, it would be better to make the necessary4- Reference: Cabinet 36 (39) Conclusion 1.

Regulations by an Order in Council, which would be validated subsequently by the Act, than that Departments should take action without cover of any kind.     On the assumption that the gap between the making of such an Order in Council and the passage into law of the Bill would be one of a few days only, and that there would be no deliberate delay between the intro-duction and passage into law of the Bill, we feel that it would be justifiable for a Government in such a situation of emer-gency to advise the issue of such an Order in Council.Regulations unsuitable for issue before outbreak of hostilities. 4.     An aspect of this matter to which we were asked to give particular consideration is the question whether all the Regu-lations now held in draft are suitable for inclusion in a code designed for issue at the onset of an emergency, before actual hostilities had begun.5.      In our opinion there are two kinds of Regulations whichshould be omitted from any such code:-(a) The Regulations dealing with Finance could not be issued automatically with the others at the onset of an emergency, but must be kept for issue at the precise moment when financial policy required it - perhaps not till an actual outbreak of hostilities. It would not be possible to publish these Regulations before they were actually required, as this would permit forestalling by the public and rob these Regulations of their effectiveness..  (b) Certain Regulations which restrict thefreedom of political discussion and of the press, or otherwise interfere more or less drastically with civil liberties.      In a state of emergency before hostilities had actually broken out it might be undesirable to issue these Regulations, but very desirable to issue other Regulations which are needed for Civil Defence purposes.
6.. To meet these difficulties the War LegislationSub-Committee have now prepared the Regulations in four codes as follows:-(l) Defence Regulations, Code A(2) Defence Regulations, Code B(3) Defence Regulations, Code AB(4) Defence (Finance) Regulations. Code A consists of all those Regulations which we consider suitable for issue at the onset of an emergency/6 either simultaneously with, or in advance of, statutory authority being obtained.      Code B consists of those Regulations which we consider to be unsuitable, on political grounds, for inclusion in such an early issue of Regulations;    we understand that none of them is essential for Departmental purposes during the precautionary period, and we recommend that they should not be issued until an actual outbreak of hostilities, even if the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act had been passed into law beforehand.     Code AB consists of all the Regulations in Codes A and B combined;    we recommend that the Regulations should be issued in this form if war broke out suddenly before Code A had been issued.     Code AB would be suitable for issue in this event even if the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act had not yet been passed into law.7. For convenience the Tables of Contents cCades Aand AB are attached to this Report as Appendix II. The full Regulations have been reprinted in the new formFor discussion of the exact point at which the first issue of Regulations should be made see paragraph 9 below.
and are in the hands of those Ministers who are Departmentalism concerned:,   they are ready for issue whenever required, and the necessary alterations are being made in the Departmental instructions.Cabinet decisions required in a period of emergency. 8. When   an   emergency   threatensfour decisions regarding the issue of Defence Regulations will be required to be taken by the Cabinet(a) as to the moment at which the Defence Regulations, Code A, should be issued;(b) as to the moment at which the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill -should be introduced;(c) as to the moment after the outbreak of hostilities at which Code B (or, if Code A had not yet been issued, Code AB) should be issued;    and(d) as to the moment when the Defence (Finance) Regulations should be issued.9.        As regards the decision at (a) above, it was proposed by the Committee of Imperial Defence thatthe Regulations should be issued &quot;at the onset of anemergency&quot; and that, subject to further considerationby the Defence Departments, this point should be regardedas coinciding with the moment at which it becomes necessary to order evacuation of the civil population.We understand that the war Office and Air Ministrymay require emergency powers as soon as the anti-aircraft defences are fully manned, irrespective of whetherevacuation had by then been ordered.     We accordingly
recommend, as indicated in the previous paragraph, that the moment at which the first Regulations should be issued should be a matter for Cabinet decision at the time, the above two alternatives being noted as useful guides for the determination of the appropriate moment.10.       On the assumption that the procedure recommended in the present Report is approved by the Cabinet, it will be necessary to make clear provision in the Government War Book for putting it into effect.Numbering of Regulations. 11.       We understand that considerable -administrative inconvenience will bo avoided if the new numbering of the Regulations   can be approved forthwith and adhered to for some time to come, and we recommend that this should be done.     We recommend also that if any additional Regulations should be found to be required they should be added at the appropriate place and that if, for example, a Regulation is required after Regulation 50 it should be numbered 50A.      If on the other hand a Regulation in the present drafts becomes unnecessars^ before the onset of an emergency (owing e.g. to the enactment of corresponding legislation in peace), we recommend that it should be omitted from the print and a gap left in the numbering with an indication that a Regulation had been cancelledo     We do not think that this course would give rise to any Parliamentary or other difficulties.
Summary of Recommendations o12.        Our recommendations may be summarised as follows:-(a) The enabling legislation providing statutory authority for the Defence Regulations should be in the form of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill attached herewith,. which should be introduced at the same time as, or as soon as possible after, the first issue of Defence Regulations.(b) The Defence Regulations should be held in readiness in four codes :-(l) Code A, for issue.at the onset of an emergency;(2) Code B, for issue as a supplement to Code A after the outbreak of hostilities; (3) Code AB, for issue after the outbreak of hostilities if Code A had not already been issued;    and(4) The Defence (Finance) Regulations, to be issued either before or after the outbreak of hostilities, at the moment when financial policy required it.(c) The times for the issue of the various Codes of Regulations, and for the introduction into Parliament of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill, should be matters for Cabinet decision when an emergency threatens;    Code A might be required at the stage when evacuation of the civil
population was ordered or at the stage when the anti-aircraft defences were ful]ymanned.(d) On the assumption that the above recommendations are accepted provision should be made in the Government War Book for putting them into effect.(e) The numbering of the Regulations should be stereotyped for some time to come;    if a regulation becomes unnecessary a gap should be left in the numbering and an indication given that the Regulation has been cancelled.Signed on behalf of the Committee, SAMUEL   HOARE.Chairman.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I., 21st July, 1939.
