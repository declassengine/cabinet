ST)?.186(39).CABINET.EMERGENCY LEGISLATION:  - UTMEPLOYIiENT INSURANCE AND UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE&apos; (including extension of classes for assistance and possible necessity for indemnifying provisions).(IORAMDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.1.     In an emergency, it will be necessary to introduce, as soon as possible,legislation on the subject of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance.Draft Bills prepared for this purpose have been approved by the Committee ofImperial Defence and are noted in the Government war Book.2.    As regards unemployment insurance, it is necessary:(l) to take power to modify the Unemployment Insurance Scheme by regula-tions in any respect other than rates of benefit, rates of contribu-tion, the Exchequer contribution to the Unemployment Fund and Treasury Advances to the Unemployment Fund;(2) to provide for any financial adjustment if persons who would ordinarily be carried by one of the Special Schemes for Unemployment Insurance (the Insurance Industry and the Banking Industry have such special schemes) have to be carried by the General Scheme;(3) to get Parliamentary sanction for any increased expenditure out of moneys provided by Parliament.3.     As regards unemployment assistance the following provisions are required;(l) to take power to extend by regulations the scope of the Unemployment Assistance Scheme, so as to cover persons at present outside its scope who are in distress as the result of the emergency.     This gives effect to the recommendations of a Committee appointed to consider the best way of making provision for such persons;(2) to take power to modify by regulations any of the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Scheme other than those which impose the household means test, including the safeguarding of certain classes of resources (e.g. the first 7s. 6d. of sickness benefit is to be disregarded) and the procedure for securing Parliamentary approval of the means test regulations;(3) to secure covering authority (similar to that which already exists for unemployment insurance) for allowances paid otherwise than in compliance with the requirements of the Actf(4) to get Parliamentary sanction for any increased expenditure out of moneys provided by Parliament-4.     Under the arrangements for making payments to persons evacuated under theGovernment Evacuation Scheme who are in need, it will be necessary to exercise1 the powers to be conferred by the Bills as soon as the Cabinet has decided that; the Evacuation Scheme shall bo put into operation.     Payments by way of allowances to persons evacuated, who are within the scope of the extended
H.Q.1336-70 H.I.2.Unemployment Assistance Scheme, may therefore have to be made &quot;before the legislation authorising such extension is enacted.     The modifications in the Unemployment Insurance Scheme must also be brought into effect if the arrangements for making payments to refugees are to be effectively organised. Allowances paid in anticipation of the passing of this legislation vd.ll become validated so soon as the legislation is enacted. 5.     If it should be necessary to exercise the emergency powers proposed and the necessary validating legislation should not be passed owing to the cessation of the emergency, other indemnifying provisions would be required. 6.     The Treasury has approved the arrangements under which the payments are to be made and. the other powers exercised in anticipation of legislation. 7.     I shall be glad to have the authority of the Cabinet for the introduction of these Bills as soon as appropriate.(Xnt&amp;.)   E. B.29th August, 1959.
