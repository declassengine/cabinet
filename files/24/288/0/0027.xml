THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1939.SECRET Copy No.    45CP. 178 (39).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.SITUATION IN THE FAR EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE herewith a memorandum &quot;prepared in the Foreign Office briefly recapitulating recent events in the Far East and putting forward various suggestions as to the line which His Majesty&apos;s Government might take in certain eventualities.H.August 21, 1939.THE present Tokyo negotiations arose out of demands by the Japanese military authorities in North China that the British concession at Tientsin should cease to be used as a base for anti-Japanese activities on behalf of the Chinese National Government. The Japanese complaints related principally to the action of Chinese terrorists, the preparation of anti-Japanese propaganda and to the unwillingness of British interests in the concession to co-operate with the Japanese efforts to suppress the Chinese national currency and substitute for it the notes of the Japanese-sponsored Federal Reserve Bank.2. A crisis was produced by the refusal of the British authorities to hand over four Chinese accused of complicity in the assassination of an official of the puppet Chinese Government. His Majesty&apos;s Government maintained that no adequate evidence in support of the charge had been produced, and the Japanese military authorities eventually blockaded the concession and subjected British subjects to humiliating treatment at the barriers.3. After considerable delay the Japanese agreed to negotiate a settlement at Tokyo on the understanding that the discussions should be confined to local issues affecting only Anglo-Japanese relations in Tientsin. It was made clear from the start that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not change their general attitude towards the Far Eastern conflict or negotiate on wider issues involving the interests of other Powers without their consent.4. Nevertheless, the agenda for the discussions drawn up by the Japanese included not only matters concerning the police administration in the concession but also demands relating to the suppression of the Chinese national currency in the British municipal area and the surrender of the Chinese Government&apos;s silver reserves stored therein.5. After satisfying themselves that a strong prima facie case had been established, His Majesty&apos;s Government informed the Japanese Government on the 9th August that they would be prepared to place no further difficulties in the way of the four Chinese accused of murder being handed over to the local Chinese authorities at Tientsin.   Meanwhile, however, Habeas Corpus proceedings have10526   [19853]
been started in the English courts and, until the position with regard to these proceedings is a little clearer, His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Tientsin has in-structions to delay the actual transfer of the men to the officers of the Chinese court. , &apos;.    &apos; .&quot;6. Subject to minor amendments a draft agreement has now been reached on the police issues concerning the municipal administration. In the course of the negotiations the Japanese military authorities have refused to separate the police and economic questions. Neither the currency nor the silver, however, con-cerns Great Britain and Japan alone. The currency question, with which the silver reserves are closely concerned, is of interest to all Powers having commercial relations with China, and any points which His Majesty&apos;s Government may concede in respect of the silver in the British Concession would form a precedent for further Japanese demands in respect of the larger silver reserves in the French Concession, not to mention those at Peking. Incidentally the larger portion of this silver is in French custody either in their concession at Tientsin or in the Legation Quarter at Peking, and the French authorities would be seriously embarrassed if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to yield to the Japanese demands except in concert with them.7. Both the French Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to agree to the neutralisation of the silver, by sealing it up, pending the outcome of the hostilities, and there is reason to believe that the Chinese Govern-ment would also agree to this solution, but Sir R. Craigie has been given to under-stand that the Japanese military authorities demand the surrender of the reserves as a sine qua non oi any settlement, and will definitely not agree to the sealing of the silver in its present locality.8. After full and careful consideration, the conclusion has been reached that it is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government alone to reach an agreement with the Japanese Government on the silver or currency questions. Sir R. Craigie has, on instructions, so informed the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, adding that His Majesty&apos;s Government are nevertheless willing to discuss these points further provided that arrangements can be made to safeguard the interests of third parties. Sir R. Craigie has also explained to the Japanese Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that the question they raise will need to be discussed in any ultimate settlement of the China situation.9. It is thus open to the Japanese Government either to make arrangements to consult the American and French Governments on the economic issues which they have raised in their limited application to Tientsin or to use the opportunity given in our communication to pave the way for conversations leading possibly to some comprehensive settlement of the Far Eastern conflict.&apos; &apos; 10. The first reaction of the Japanese negotiators has been to reiterate the thesis that police and economic issues are indivisible and to leave it to His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the course of a short adjournment of the negotiations, to approach the American and French Governments themselves. Indeed, in face of His Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude that the responsibility for the further conduct of the negotiations lies with the Japanese, it is possible, if not probable, that they may break off the Tokyo negotiations and resume in an intensified form the blockade of the Tientsin Concession, and the anti-British agitation which they have promoted throughout the occupied areas. ,11. In that event it is for consideration how the renewed Japanese attack can best be met. In view of the European situation the only courses open to His Majesty&apos;s Government would appear to be (a) Non-resistance and evacuation, or(b) Resistance, exhibiting itself in the denunciation of the Anglo-JapaneseCommercial Treaty and such economic reprisals as seem to be reasonably effective and prudent.12.. A combination of the two methods might possibly prove to be the most effective reply to Japanese aggression. The steps to be taken might then be in the following order :-(i) Denunciation of the commercial treaty.   Views are at present being-exchanged with the Governments of the Dominions, India and Burma
both as to the advisability of denouncing and the choice of opportunity to do this. In view of the &quot; lead &quot; which the United States Govern-&apos; ment no doubt consider they have given, it may well prove necessary for us at some point to denounce our treaty, if we are to avoid the damaging accusation that His Majesty&apos;s Government have again let down the United States in their attempt to check Japanese belligerence. In this connexion it is well to bear in mind that, whether or not a formal notice of denunciation had been given, we should still not be precluded from putting into effect any retaliatory measures we deemed appropriate, at least of proportionate extent and approxi-mately similar in kind to the material damage done to British interests resulting from Japan&apos;s disregard of her obligations under other treaties to which we are parties, (ii) The evacuation, to whatever extent this may be thought desirable or prove possible, of British subjects from the occupied areas. This would, mean advising that women and children should leave in the first place, and then other British subjects according to their circumstances. It would also entail giving some financial assistance by subsidising passages and providing maintenance in cases of destitution. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Tokyo and Shanghai have been asked for their observations on the subject with a view to working out the details. The denunciation of the treaty, coupled with some measure of evacuation, might be calculated to interest the Americans and puzzle and alarm the Japanese, and the impression would deliberately be given that His Majesty&apos;s Government were &quot;clearing the decks for action.&quot;(iii) The imposition of a clearing arrangement, leaving our hands free to take further economic steps in the light of United States actions and Japan&apos;s reactions.(iv) And, finally, we could consider the grant of further financial assistance to china. In this respect it is to be noted that an agreement for commercial credits to a total of nearly  3,000,000 under the Export Guarantees Act is about to be concluded with the Chinese Government.13. There is a consensus of opinion, including that of the leading British commercial interests in China, that a refusal to surrender to Japanese threats, combined with such economic reprisals as may be possible, will be less damaging in the long run, or even in the near future, than a policy of co-operation, however limited, in the Japanese exploitation of China on its present lines.14. While every effort will be made to avoid a breakdown of the Tokyo negotiations, there is a point beyond which it is not advisable to go, and it may well be argued that the danger of surrender on vital principles is greater than that of a breakdown of the conversations. The respite to be won by concessions would be of temporary and precarious nature and the conflict of principle would inevitably arise again almost immediately.15. &apos; If it is cardinal to our general policy to promote in any way possible co-operation with the United States, or at least to do nothing that would make that co-operation more difficult, we have not really got much choice, and from this point of view, as I am disposed to think from others, it is better to face the situation now. Confronted by a resolute opposition of the kind indicated above, the Japanese may well pause before proceeding to further extremes. They also have their fears for the future; it is certain that they wish to avoid an increase of their&apos;warlike commitments; but if a policy of menaces is shown to produce results they will naturally intensify it. Conversely, while a prior promise of support is not likely to be obtained from the United States, resistance to Japanese threats, however passive in form, will make it easier for American opinion to show in effective ways a sympathy that will induce caution on the part of Japan. What would be regarded, on the other hand, as a pusillanimous policy of gradual surrender to Japanese threats would alienate American opinion both in respect of the Far East and elsewhere.16. If, presently, it becomes apparent to the Japanese military mind that the co-operation of Great Britain is not to be obtained by force, and that the progressive elimination of British interests in China is not bringing Japan any
Bearer to the realisation of her dreams, a suitable opportunity may come for the proposal of a more constructive programme by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The collapse of both the Chinese national currency and the local puppet currencies sponsored by the Japanese is embarrassing to Japanese interests in the occupied areas as well as to other nationals. The currency question might, as suggested above, provide a pretext for the initiation of multilateral conversations which could perhaps be extended to cover a comprehensive settlement.17. As a final suggestion it should be noted that the Japanese have repeatedly explained that they have been driven to their present policy of seeking a self-sufficient economic bloc with their neighbours on the mainland by their exclusion from the markets of the British Empire and other countries. It might therefore be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to offer to contribute to a general settlement of Far Eastern problems by trying, so far as they are concerned, to remove this alleged grievance on the part of Japan, provided the United States and other interested nations would consider a similar contribution towards the peace of the Pacific. At a suitable opportunity an intimation of His Majesty&apos;s Governments willingness to act on these lines might be conveyed informally to the Japanese Government as an earnest of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s desire to offer some more constructive way out of Japan&apos;s difficulties than the prolongation of a destructive campaign in China, and a sterile competition in reprisals with her principal commercial customers.Foreign Office, August 21, 1939.
