o J A.C.  458,BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OF TRADE - MAY 1959.Summary of Reports submitted by members of. the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in May ( 78.5 million) showed an increase of  3.1 million as compared with May 1933.    Imports of raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were  2.4 million more, and imports of food, drink and tobacco  1.5 million less.    Exports of United Kingdom products ( 42.3 million) were  4.1 million more than in May 1938*RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    In the four weeks ended the 2 3th May 1939 railway traffic receipts increased by  1,091,000, or 9.S per cent,  as compared with the corresponding period of 1938.The total receipts for the 21 weeks ended the 28th May showed a decrease of  232,000 or 0.4 per cent, as compared with the corresponding period of 1933.EMPLOYMENT.      Between the 17th April and the 15th May employment showed a further improvement which extended to nearly every industry.It is provisionally estimated that at the 15th May the number of insured persons, aged 16 to 64 (including&apos; those insured under the agricultural scheme and in the classes of domestic employment which became insurable at the 4th April 1938) in employment in Great Britain was approximately 12,667,000.    this was 156,000 more  than at the 17th April, 1939, and approximately 440,000 more than at the 16th May, 1933.    The total number of unemployed persons on the registers of the Employment Exchanges was 1,492,232,  a decrease of 152,112 as compared with the 17th April, 1959, and of 236,523 as compared v/ith the 16th May, 1933.
BANKING.    There v/as a seasonal increase in May in ths holdings of cash and of short money and discounts by the -Clearing Banks.    Advances were lower by about  2 million on the average.    Bill rates remained steady after falling at the beginning&apos; of the month.FINANCIAL CONDITIONS  ABROAD.Belgium.    The National Bank of Belgium regained some of the gold and foreign exchange lost in previous months.    The Bank rate was reduced from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent.France.    The French Treasury successfully launched a further    I loan for the conversion of the external short-term debt of the French Government and the French State Railways.    The loan is in the form of 4 per cent, and 3 per1 cent,  six-year bonds expressed in guilders, Swiss francs and dollars and is for about 300,COO,COO guilders.    The visible import surplus was gradually reduced and the franc strengthened in relation to other currencies.Germany. The balance of visible trade,  which had been adverse in March, was favourable to Germany in April and May.    Imports in both the latter months were substantially lower than in March; exports fell in April but recovered practically to the March level in May.Holland.    There has been pressure on the guilder and money rates have tended to rise.Japan.    The currency has been assisted by the severe restriction of imports of cotton, wool etc. and by the high price obtained for exports of raw silk.    Nevertheless the rise in the cost of living, which has bee.; more rapid than the rise in wages, has not been checked.Uni ted S t at e s of Ame r i c a,  Owing to greater confidence in the home and international political situation,  there was a slight improvement in financial and other markets in May but industrial activity    remained at the lowest level since September,  1933..-.Shipping.    The outward trades to Australia, Hew Zealand and India and trades to and from Gibraltar and Egypt were on the whole satisfactory in May, but trade with the Far East remained unsatisfactory.
There was a reduction of business for tramp ships owing partly to the heavy decline in the demand from the River Plate and partly to the view that on account of the improvement in the international political situation there was no risk in deferring shipments.SHIPBUILDING.    Orders continued to be placed for cargo boats during May,  though at a less rapid rate than in April; there was,  on the whole,  a satisfactory amount of business in the various shipyards.COAL.    The improvement in the coal industry was maintained j in May.      The high level of activity in the manufacturing industries caused a steady demand in the inland market.    Export trade was more active in May than at any period since October, 193$ though the settlement of the coal strike in the United States has ended the diversion of orders from United States to European sources of supply.IRON AND STEEL. Production of steel ingots and castings . amounted in May to 1,213,100 tons and was the highest monthly total ever recorded, exceeding the previous record total of November,  1937, by nearly 4-0,000 tons.      The output of pig iron rose from 608,900 tons in April to 692,100 tons in May;      113 furnaces were in blast at the end of May as compared with 100 at the beginning.Although the direct and indirect requirements of the rearmament programme were largely responsible for the high levelg of activity in the industry,  commercial orders also increased. The placing of business was encouraged by the announcement made in May that the prices of the principal iron and steel products imwould be stabilised until the end of October.      There was an improvement   in export trade, and steps are being taken to ensure that,  in spite of the pressure of demand in the home market, adequate supplies of steel will be available for export.I
3 RNON-FERROUS METALS.    Metal markets -remained steady during May and demand was well maintained in the United Kingdom.-ENGINEERING,    Unemployment in the engineering industry is steadily declining due, principally, to the increasing volume of Government orders, but also to the steady flow of civil business;    marine engineering has benefited from the revival in shipbuilding consequent on the proposals of the Government to assist the shipbuilding industry.      Exports of machinery fell from 40,000 tons valued at  5.1 million in March to 34,000 tons valued at  4.2 million in April but rose to 37,000 .tons, valued at  4.9 million in May.      Imports of machinery in the first five months of 1939 were valued at  10.2 million against  9.7 million in the same period of 1938.      Imports of rolling mill (metal working) machinery have shown a notable increase following the exceptional demand for steel;    it is understood that much of this machinery has been imported duty free under licence.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      Orders for plant both in home and in foreign markets remained satisfactory, but there was a decline in the oversea demand for the lighter electrical products.      Inquiries for plant were few and were largely from Empire countries.Prices showed little change.     Foreign competition was less severe than it was some months ago.Exports of electrical machinery, goods and apparatus were valued at  1,570,000 in May, 1939,as compared with  1,411,000 in April, 1939,and  1,695,000 in May, 1938.During the first five months of 1939 authorised undertakings generated 11,659,000,000 units of electricity an increase of 12.7 per cent, as compared with the corresponding period of 1933.MOT OR INDUSTRY. New registrations of mechanically-propelled vehicles in April were 38,897,    a decrease of 460 compared with the corresponding period of 1938.    In April, 1939, 70 per cent, of the total new
registrations of motor-cars were in respect of cars of 8 to 10 horsepower as compared with only 62 per cent,  in April, 1938. Registrations of new cars of IV horsepower and over were 1,817 in April as compared with 2,775 in April, 1938.Imports of motor-cars from Prance increased from 436 in the first five months of 1938 to 1,246 in the first five months of 1939.CHEMICALS.    The increased demand for heavy chemicals was maintained in May.      Deliveries of alkali and chlorine products, except hydrochloric acid, were higher in May than in April in both the home and export trades;    there was a substantial increase in home deliveries of mineral acids and an unusually heavy demand for sulphuric acid,  especially in South Wales. The demand for heavy chemicals for the rayon industry and for dyestuffs for the textile industry also improved.      Trade in coal tar products, wood distillation products and pharamceutical chemicals was satisfactory, but there has been a decline in the sales of fertilisers in 1939 as compared with 1938.POTTERY.      Although the percentage of unemployment in the pottery industry declined from 20 in April to 16.8 in May, there was no substantial improvement in the outlook of the industry.      Exports of general earthenware and china increased slightly in May as compared with May 1938, but there were no signs of improvement in the home market.      Factories for making glazed wall and hearth tiles continued to be active, but forward orders were not heavy.      Exports of sanitary earthenware increased in May as compared with May 1938, but sales in the home market declined slightly.      Owing to increased military requirements,  there was a good demand for sanitary ware of fire-clay;    the demand for electrical fittings was also good.Wool. The activity of all sections of the industry increased in all districts in May as compared with April.    The increase in   activity was due largely to Government orders, but
there has also &quot;been an increase in inquiries from overseas markets.Exports of tissues, yarns and tops all showed an increase in May over April.      There was an upward tendency in price of raw wool and of tops and yarns.COTTON.      Production and employment in the cotton industry showed a further improvement in May,  although expansion was less marked than in previous months.      The index of yarn output was 106 as compared with 105 in April, 1939,  and 85 in May, 1938.      Government orders had not had their full effect on the activity of the industry by the end of May.Exports of both yarn and piece goods were greater in May than in April but the improvement was largely due to the greater number of working    days in May.      Exports were however higher than in May, 1938.HOSIERY.      There has been a considerable increase in activity in the hosiery industry throughout the country. Prices of pure silk have risen in anticipation of an increase! demand during the remainder of 1939 for full-fashioned hosiery-RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of average daily retail sales in April, 1939, was 1.3% higher than in April,1938,  though as a result of the earlier date of Easter in 1939,  some of the pre-Easter trade fell outside the month of April.      Average daily sales of food and perishables increased by 2,9% in April, 1939, as compared with April, 1938,  though food prices fell by 2.5^o in the same period.-     Average daily sales of non-food merchandise were 0*59:&apos; lower in April, 1939, than in April 1938; this decline may be partly attributable to the earlier date of EasteriPreliminary returns for May indicate a satisfactory increase in sales as compared, with May, 1938, with a continuance of the tendency for retail trade in Central London to fall behind the rest of the country.
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.      Bales of wool received into store during the 10 months ended 30th April, 1939, amounted to 2,618,000 as compared with 2,803,000 in the corresponding period a year earlier;    the quantities disposed of &quot;by sale or shipment were respectively 2,414,000 and 2,330,000.Prom 1st December 1938 to 30th May, 1939, wheat and flour shipments expressed as bushels of wheat amounted to 49,967,000 compared with 82,011,000 during the corresponding period a year earlier.Exports of butter from 1st July, 1938, to 27th May, 1939, amounted to 94,000 tons,  of which 89,000 tons were exported to the United Kingdom.      The figures for the corresponding period a year earlier were respectively 83,000 and 77,000.CANADIAN TRADE.      The index of the physical volume of business for April was 116.7 as compared with 113.2 in March. There was an improvement in the wholesale price level and an increase in the production of minerals except gold and silver, and in exports of lumber;    but a number of the indices of economic conditions were lower in April than in March,INDIAN TRADE.      Imports into India were valued in May at 1,462 lakhs, as compared with 1,340 lakhs in April, 1939,  and 1,244 lakhs in May 1938.      Exports from India were valued at 1,533 lakhs as compared with 1,324 lakhs in April, 1939, and 1,202 lakhs in May 1938.      When account is taken.of gold and silver movements, India had a &quot;favourable balance of trade of 143 lakhs in May as compared with favourable balances of 61 lakhs in April, 1939,  and of 30 lakhs in May, 1938.SOUTH APRICAN TRADE.      From the statistical information at present available it appears that the level of economic activity in 1939 is,  as was the case in 1938, below the level of activity of 1937 but above that of 1936.      There is a more optimistic outlook in business circles than there was a year ago.Exports from South Africa,  other than gold, declined by 9.1per cent,  in value in April, 1939, as compared with April, 1938;exports of diamonds, maize, hides and skins and wattle bark andextract were higher, but exports of wool lower.-7-
