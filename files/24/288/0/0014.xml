(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRET. CP.  164 (39).CAB I N E T. CLAIM FOR SPINSTERS&apos;  PENSIONS. Memorandum by the Chancellor&apos; of the Exchequer.1. It will he remembered that, as a result ofagitation by a body known as the National Spinsters&apos; Pensions Association, which received considerable support in the House of Commons,  it was decided early in 1938 to set up a Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. C.T. Le Quesne, K.C.,  &quot;to examine and report on the complaints which are made as to the position of unmarried women vinder the Contributory Pensions Acts and on the practical questions which would arise if the age at which Old Age Pensions under those Acts are payable to unmarried women were lowered&quot;.2, The Committee, which was small but representative-  and included two women, examined the matter in great detail and heard evidence from all interested parties. It submitted its Report in March of this year,  and there is attached in the appendix to -this Note a summary of the Report.      The Report itself contained no summary of conclusions and passages in it show that on some points definity of expression was sacrificed in order to secure unanimity.     Nevertheless, it is quite clear that the Committee did not endorse any of the mainCOPY NO.
contentions of the spinsters and their champions. This view is clearly accepted &quot;by the Spinsters&apos; Association who have freely criticised the findings of the Report since its issue.3. While the Report on all the main issues supported the view previously taken by the Government that nothing should be done to meet the particular position of the spinsters, it was critical of the Government on three minor points which are dealt with in the two concluding paragraphs of the Appendix.      These points, which deal with matters of a highly technical nature, have been examined by represntatives of the Ministry of Health,. Scottish Department of Health, Government Actuary and the Treasury.      The conclusion reached is that no present action need be taken in regard to these details, but that if it were felt that some concession must eventually be made,  the simplest and the most logical v/ay to handle the matter would be by reducing to -g-d. the increase of Id. which under present legislation will be due from the woman employee herself as from the year 1956.      There is clearly no need to make any announcement on this point at the moment.4. The National Spinsters&apos; Pensions Associationare actively pursuing their campaign in spite of the Report of the Committee.      A resolution concerning Spinsters&apos; Pensions has been tabled in the House of Commons in the name of 199 members, pressing for revision of the amount and conditions of existing pensions with a view to their extension and urging the Government to take into special consideration the claim of spinsters for their
pensions   at an earlier age.     It is clear therefore that the time has come when the Government must reach a decision on the merits of this claim.     Apart from the fact that the claims of the Association have &quot;been rejected by an independent Committee,  the initial cost of meeting them would he about  4,400,000 a year, I agree too with the view of the Committee that, if it were decided at this cost to grant a pension to spinsters at 55, it would he impracticable to withhold it from other classes of insured women, and, further, that the demand for pensions at 55 for the wives of pensioner husbands would he almost impossible to resist.      These consequential extensions would increase-the initial cost of the-concession to some  14 millions a year.      Incidentally it may be mentioned that the Labour Party have never officially supported the demand of the spinsters taken by itself, though they would no doubt be prepared to look at the position of spinsters in relation to any general improvement which they might wish to make in the whole pension scheme.5. I recommend, therefore, that If and when we are asked for our views about the claim of the spinsters we should say .that we have referred their claim for consideration by an independent and impartial Committee which came to the conclusion that the Spinsters&apos; Pensions Association had failed to make their case;    that we are prepared in the main to accept the view of this Committee and are not prepared to introduce legislation to provide
pensions for spinsters under more favourable conditions than now operate.      If we are pressed to express an opinion upon the minor points in the Report which are critical, we could say that these are technical matters which will require careful consideration, but do not call for any immediate action.(Initialled)    J. S.reasury Chambers, S.W.1, 21st July, 1939.
1 0 appendix.Summary of the Report of the Committee on Pensions for Unmarried Women.The Committee on Pensions for Unmarried Women, were appointed to examine the complaints of spinsters as to their treatment under the Contributory Pensions Acts, and to report on the questions which would arise if the pension age of insured spinsters were lowered.     They have examined various allegations that spinsters are inequitably treated under the scheme as it exists at present and various statistical arguments which have been put forward by the supporters of earlier pensions for spinsters.They point out that a valid comparison cannot he made between the pensions received in a particular year by spinsters aged 65-70 and the contributions paid in the same year by spinsters under 65;    and they express the view that the contributions paid by women prior to their marriage should, as at present, be made available towards the cost of providing their own &quot;benefits as wives or widows.Dealing with arguments based on a comparison of the position of widows and of spinsters as regards pension, they show that the grant of pensions at 55 by the Act of 1929 to a temporary class of &quot;pre-Acf widows was based on different considerations from those applying to spinsters, and affords no support for the contention that spinsters should logically be granted pensions at 55.     As for.the permanent category of women who become entitled to a pension on widowhood, they conclude that the claim to pension for spinsters at 55, on the basis of &quot;equity with the post-Act widow&quot;, is not a strong one.
1 n 3-i- 1/ d)The Committee report that the evidence &quot;before them -----did not indicate that the loss of insurance rights by death and lapse between the ages of 55 and 65 is heavier amongst spinsters than among other classes of insured persons;    and, upon the &quot;basis of an extensive enquiry made hy the Ministry of Health, are of opinion that the statutory provisions for maintaining the pension rights of insured spinsters are adquate, and that the majority of those who drop out of insurance at an advanced age do so voluntarily.      On the statistics, it would not appear that a very large proportion of spinsters have to give up work in order to look after relatives.A further argument advanced in support of earlier pensions for spinsters was that industrial conditions press more hardly on them than on other classes of insured persons.      The Committee were unable to find any statistical support for this contention from an examination of rates of cessation of insurance, rates of unemployment, sickness and mortality, or from Public Assistance statistics, hut, on the basis of the personal evidence that was given to them, they come to the conclusion that, on the whole, life for elderly spinsters is somewhat harder than for married persons who have their families to fall back on, or for pensioned widows.The Committee consider that there is probably a considerable number of spinsters who make some contribution towards the support   of dependants and that some of them therehy diminish their own resources and comfort in later years.It has &quot;been suggested that there is a large number of &quot;War spinsters&quot; who should &quot;be compensated, like War
widows, with pensions.      But the census returns show that high marriage rates during and since the War have resulted in the proportion of women who are spinsters at the ages concerned &quot;being no higher than it was &quot;before the V/ar.So far as the practical consequences of the grant of pensions to spinsters at 55 are concerned, the Committee quote the initial cost of so doing as  4,400,000 a year, hut they think that if it were decided to grant a pension to spinsters at 55, it would be impracticable to withhold it from other classes of insured women and that, in practice, the demand for pensions at 55 for the wives of pensioner husbands would be impossible to resist.      These consequential extensions would increase the initial cost of the concession to some  14,000,000 a year.      They do not consider that the risks are very serious that the grant of pensions to spinsters at 55 would lead to under-cutting or a general depression of women&apos;s wages, or to the dismissal of spinsters at age 55.      They think that if old age pensions were granted at a lower age health and unemployment benefits should cease at the age at which pensions begin.The Committee examine the contention that the spinster who does not marry is charged an excessive con-tribution in relation to her pensions rights.      They point out that, in order to provide for a pension   from 65*-V0 a contribution beginning at age 16 of just under 4d. a week is necessary, whilst a further Id. of the present weekly   contribution of 5-g-do is charged in respect of over-70 pensions, thus leaving a balance of just over ^d. a week.      On one method of analysing the contributions this remaining -g-d. is treated as a contribution towards the cost of widows and orphans pensions.      The Committee
1 ft rconsider it reasonable that spinsters up to age 50 should make this contribution of ^d- a week towards the cost of benefits to which the majority of them become contingently entitled on marriage, but they are not unanimous as to whether it should continue to be paid after age 50, the majority thinking that spinsters have a grievance at being asked to pay it after that age.    Further, the Committee consider that spinsters have a just cause of complaint in that, on the basis of the above analysis, no State subsidy is made towards the cost of the old age pension of a women who has contributed since the age of 16, whilst there is a State subsidy towards widows&apos; pensions. The majority of the Committeev consider that it is no satisfactory reply to this complaint to argue that, since the Exchequer contribution is a lump sum payment towards the cost of the scheme, the subsidy may be regarded as applicable rateably to all benefits, since in that event the contribution of spinsters towards widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions would rise to l^d., which the majority of the Committee consider too high a contribution for them to make.In conclusion, the Committee deal with two complaints concerning the Voluntary Contributors&apos; Act of 1937, which fixes income limits of  400 a year for men and  250 a year for women and provides that admission is to be confined to men and women under 40, except for the initial period which ended on 2nd January, 1939, during which men and women were admitted up to age 55.      The Committee do not consider that persons over age 55 have a just complaint at their exclusion, but, with regard to the different income limits
which were fixed for men and women, they are of opinion that, whilst the limit of  250 is not too low for women in the permanent section of the scheme, it might have &quot;been fixed a little higher for women during the initial period.
