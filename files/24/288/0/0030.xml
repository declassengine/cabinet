1.      VARIOUS MEASURES CONTAINED IN GOVERNMENT,WAR BOOK APPENDIX &quot;G&quot;. &quot;     &quot;THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the following measures contained in the Government War Book. Appendix &quot;G&quot;:SCHEDULE I.Serial No. 13.     Defence Proclamation.SIR JOHN ANDERSON said that the primary purpose of the Defence Proclamation was to give warning of the intention to exercise emergency powers,  if these were required before the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill was passed.     As the Bill had been passed this purpose no longer held good, but he thought that the issue of the Defence Proclamation prior- to evacuation would serve to bring home to the public the seriousness of the situation in a way in which no act of Parliament could do. CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE agreed :-(l)    That the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs and the Lord privy Seal should be given discretion to issue the Defence&quot;Proclamation at the appropriate moment.(2)    To record the view that this moment would probably be when evacuation was ordered.Serial No. 14(a).      Imposition of Defence Regulations. (Paper No. D.M.(39)9), The proposal before the Committee was thatCode A. of Defence Regulations should be imposed forth-with.     A discussion took place as to whether any ofthe Regulations contained therein would conflict with
the assurances given in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs during the debate on the Emergency powers (Defence) Act.SIR ALE7;ANDER MAXWELL thought that there was nothing in Code A which should conflict with the assurances given by the Secretary of State.CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE agreed?-(3)    That, subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, Code A of Defence Regulations should be imposed forthwith.^Note by the Secretary;-     At a subsequent meeting between the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, it was decided to apply Code A forthwith, but with the exception of certain regulations.     These regulations are the following.-6.     Inventions and. designs. SO.     Change of name.30.     Deaths occurring in--conseq.uence of war operations. 31.     Appointment of additional registrars and. d-eputyregistrars of births and deaths. 33,      Exemption of certain women from Acts relatingto midwives. 37.     Curfew.40.     Additional inspectors of constabulary, 41.     Visiting committees for certain prisons. 48.     Visiting committees for prisons in Scotland. 59,     Exemptions from Acts relating to factories,mines and quarries. SO.      Safety and welfare of factory workers, 79,     Derelict articles.80.     Amendment of Geneva Convention ..cts.An additional regulation regarding the swearing in ofspecial constables is being made. The existing numbering of regulations will not be altered!&quot;/SCHEDULE III.Serial No. 1._A.R.P, Measures.SIR JOHN ANDERSON pointed out that
^; &amp;the list of Air Raid Precautionary Measures appearing in Serial No. 1. of Schedule III of Appendix &quot;G&quot; cover a very wide range. Broadly they could he divided into two categories firstly,  important measures,  such as evacuation, which would require Cabinet decision, and secondly, a number of less important measures, concerned with the preparation of personnel and buildings for Air Raid Precautions,  such for instance-, as had to do with shelters and respirators.     He did not propose to ask the Committee to give a decision on the particular measure set out in Schedule III, but merely sought authority to put the less important measures into operation as and when he thought fit, and to use his discretion as to when the more important ones should be referred to the Cabinet.CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE agreed :-(4)      To authorise the Lord Privy Seal to put into operation such minor Air Raid Precautionary Measures under Serial No. 1 of Schedule III, as, for instance, the preparation of buildings and personnel, as and when he may consider necessary.(5)      To authorise the Lord Privy Seal to take&apos;the necessary steps with the. Departments concerned to instruct public ^utility undertakings to put similar air raid precautionary measures into operation forthwith.(6)      To authorise the Lord Privy Seal to j- use his discretion as to when the more important measures, such as evacuation, should be referred to the Cabinet..
Serial Ho.  3.   - Civil Hospital Scheme.CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE took note :-(?)     That the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland proposed to arrange for all Hospitals to render a daily Led state to Regional Headquarters, as soon as these were ready to act.(8)     That action to clear the Hospitalswould probably be taken after evacuation was complete.Serial No. 6.     Army Mobilisation.(Previous reference: Paper No, K.308)MR. HORE-BELISHA said that the War Office were placed in the position of great difficulty owing tothe non-embodiment of the Regular Army Reserve and theTerritorial Field Army.     He instanced the following :-(i)      The Militia were being used to guard vulnerable points, for which they were quite unfitted, and which was properly a duty for the Territorial Field Army.(ii)     Evacuation now seemed imminent, and itwas most necessary that the Territorial Field Army should be embodied first.(iii)     As soon as evacuation started theRailways would not be available for the calling up of Reservists and Territorial Field Army personnel.(iv)      The Regular Army Reserve was needed to complete the Units scheduled to go overseas with the Advanced Air Striking Force.Continuing, MR. HORE-BELISKA said that he couldif necessary, call up the Regular Army Reserve andthe Territorial Field Army without publicity, as hadalready been done with the Air Defence of GreatBritain.     This could now be done in three days,
but would take at least eight days,  if orderedafter evacuation began.CONCLUSIONS.After discussion the COMMITTEE agreed(9)To recommend that on military grounds the calling up of the Regular Army Reserve and the Territorial Field Army should be ordered forthwith.To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Pefence to report accordingly to the Prime Minister,Meeting, the Prime Minister reaffirmed his previous decision that in present circumstances it was not desirable to call up the Regular Army Reserve and the Territorial Field Army, but said that this decision should be .kept under review from day to day,/   Covering Authority was given for the calling up of Key parties of the Territorial Field Army y &apos;Serial No.9. The Imposition of Postal and Telegraph Censorships  c-THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note bythe Secretary covering a Report by ad hoc Sub-Committeeof the Standing Inter-departraental Committee onCensorship.  (Paper No. D.M. (39)8),^Note by the Secretary :Subsequent to theCOLONEL MARTIN explained the followingpoints :-(i)That both postal and telegraph censorship was only outward.(ii)That telegraph     censorship included telephony and radio telephony, and was imposed on outward communications to all countries, Dominions, etc.That postal censorship would be confined to the countries detailed&apos;   in paragraph 4(c)(ii), of Paper No. D.M.(39)3, except in the case of air mails when it would be universal.
O p *   u &apos;3That in-coming -press telegrams would only he liable to scrutiny and not censorship, and thus there would be no violation of pledges given to the Press in this country..   (ADMIRAL USBORNE agreed).-That since printed matter would be subject to censorship special arrangements would be made to enable parcels of newspapers to be sent abroad without any delay being Imposed,That it would be desirable to communicate the decision of the Committee to the French, and to invite them to take parallel action.ADMIRAL USBORNE said that Press Censorship would not be imposed until general mobilisation was taking place.      It would, however, be desirable in anticipation to institute the First Stage of the Ministry of Information.     A discussion ensued in which the points were made that parallel action by the French and by the Dominions was very desirable.CONCLUSIONS.Subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, THE COMMITTEE agreed -(H)     That postal and telegraph censorship should be imposed forthwith,  on the scope recommended in Paper No. D.M.(39)8, and the War Office empowered to make all arrangements necessary in connection therewith.(i v)(v) (vi)(12.)      That the Foreign Office should be requested to inform&apos;, the &quot;French Government arf the above decision and to invite them to take parallel action immediately.-
O rs r*(13)   to authorise the neucleus Staff of the Ministry of Information to form the Censorship Division forthwith, but not to institute Stage 1 of the Ministry at present./fNote by the Secretary:-(i)   The Secretary of State for the Dominions who was not present at the Meeting, subsequently agreed to Conclusions (10) - (12).(ii)   The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence consulted, the Prime Minister,    who approved Conclusions (10) - (12).2. PETROL STOCKS; MIXING OF GRADES. CONCLUSION.THE COMMITTEE agreed!:-&apos;(14)   to authorise the Secretary for Mines to instruct the Pool Board,   that the mixing of the various grades of petrol should be carried out where it was necessary to do so;    and that the Secretary for Mines should be authorised to arrange for the general mixing of grades when the situation demanded it, subject to consultation with the President of the Oil Board.

5o    DEFEIfCE MEASURES IN AFRICA.THE COMMITTEE load under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for &quot;war (Paper Ho. D.M.39(10)) and a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper Ho, D.M.  39(11)) making recommendations for precautionary measures in Africa.CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE agreed:-(S3) To.invite the Secretary of State for theDominions to request the Government of Southern Rhodesia to send forthwith the Southern Rhodesia Air Unit to Kenya in accordance with war plans.(24) To invite the Secretary of State for theDominions to request the Government of Southern Rhodesia to take preparatory measures for the mobilisation of the 1st Battalion, Rhodesian Regiment.,(25) That the following Regular units should bemobilised forthwith:-(a) The northern Brigade King&apos;s AfricanRifles(b) The Southern Brigade.King1s AfricanRifles(c) The Northern Rhodesia Regiment(d) First Line Battalions and otherregular Units of the Royal West African Frontier Force.(26)     .

9 H 16j u JLwas desirable.     He pointed out that under the terras of the warning   telegram.notifying the institution of the Precautionary Stage, Governments would only be authorised to adopt such precautions against possible surprise attack and such limited, precautions in anticipation of war as are laid down for the Precautionary Stage of defence schemes.     It would be possible to ensure that no precipitate action such as the rounding up of potential enemy aliens would be taken.     At the same time, as all the preparations under defence schemes hinged on the Precautionary Stage notification, Colonial Governments would be in a position tbf some bewilderment if they were told to go to such extreme lengths as mobilisation without the Precautionary Stage having been instituted.     A discussion ensued in vriiich it was pointed out that under the existing political hypothesis of Germany being the only enemy there were certain objections to the institution of a Precautionary Stage abroad in advance of home.CONCLUSION.(28) To defer a decision on the institution of the Precautionary Stage in the Colonies.
6.      HONG KONG EVACUATION SCHEME.(See SCHEDULE I, Serial No.  12 of Appendix G ).The Committee had under consideration a Note by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the Hong Kong Evacuation Scheme (Paper No. D.M.39(5)).THE SECRETARY .OF STATS FOR THE COLONIES . said that it was important that evacuation should take place before an active attack.     Voluntary evacuation was at present in progress.     He would like discretion to order compulsory evacuation under the pre-arranged scheme after due consultatidn-with interested Ministers at a moment which he should judge to be appropriate.SIR GEORGE MOUNSEY said that the Foreign Office was not. quite ready to put forward its views about evacuation of families from North China. The problem was not now of such immediate urgency and he did not wish to delay discussion of the scheme for Hong Kong on this account.CONCLUSIONS.(29)     To authorise the Secretary of State for theColonies to order the compulsory evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong . if, and when he- should consider this measure necessary after consultation with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, the Foreign Secretary and the Service Ministers.(30)     To take note that the Foreign Office would put forward, proposals regarding the evacuation of women and children from North China at a later date.
S*      RECRUITMENT POLICY OH THE OUTBREAK OF WAR.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he had mentioned the policy of recruiting for the army after the outbreak of war at the last meeting of the Cabinet, but no decision had been reached.       His proposal was that volunteers should not be accepted, but that the machinery of the Militia should be made use of, other ago groups being called up as required.        In this way an orderly use of man-power could be ensured.       Ho did not suggest that tills procedure should be extended to the Royal Airm   Paper Ho, D,M.  (39) 3 Annox Bt, para. (b)0 -14-ECONOMIC WARFARE:    STATUTORY LIST POLICY.THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a memorandum hy the Foreign Office requesting a decision as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should employ a Statutory List as an adjunct to Trading with the Enemy legislation. (Paper Ho. D.M.   (39) 7.)SIR GEORGE MOUNSSY explained the object of Statutory Lists as set out in the memorandum and said that although they would not become effective until after the passage of the Trading with the Enemy Bill, an early decision on the subject was desirable so that our discussions with the French could proceed,CONGLUSIONTHE COMMITTEE agreed(31)    To approve the employment of a Statutory List as an adjunct to Trading with the Enemy legislation in a manner proposed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in Paper Ho, D,II..  (39) 7,
Force,and his proposal would, in fact,., facilitate voluntary recruiting for the Royal ^ir Force and for Air Raid Precaution Services, as volunteers could he directed into those channels.       Ke was aware that legislation would have to he introduced to permit age groups other than the present Militia group, to he called up, hut he thought that on the outbreak of war it would be desirable to issue a wireless statement which would be agreed upon by the intorootod Departments,  tolling the people that it was proposed to call up personnel as required for the army, and that volunteers were not,  therefore, required.MR. WOLFE said, that the Military Service Bill was already in draft, and it was the intention to present it to Parliament immediately on the outbreak, of war.      There would be no difficulty in carrying out the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposal immediately the Bill was passed.There was a general discussion on the proposal and it was agreed that the principles involved wore of such importance that they should be brought before the Cabinet.CONCLUSION.ThiS COMMITTEE agreed:-(32)    To invite the Secretary cf State for War and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to prepare a joint memorandum on the subject of recruitment policy on the outbreak of war for early submission to the Cabinet.
o S&quot;V w9. PROVISION OF T-Sfeb temporary ALTERNATIVE BRIDGESON THE THAMES.THE COMMITTEE had. under consideration a Memorandum by the Ministry of Transport on the Provision of Temporary Alternative Bridges on the Thames in and near London (Paper Ho. D.M.(39)6).CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE agreed:-(33)        (a) To authorise the Minister of Transport to negotiate with the London County Council for the immediate construction of the shore ends of three temporary bridges across the Thames on sites already chosen between Westminster Bridge and Albert Bridge on terms to be ^agreed with the approval of the Treasury;    and on the understanding that the L- ndon County Council should he persuaded to agree to accept the ordinary rate of Air Raid Precautions grant.(b) To authorise the Minister of Transport to take immediate steps to construct the shore ends of a temporary bridge at Staines to carry the trunk road traffic in the event of the existing bridge being destroyed.
9    f*10.    NAVAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENTS OF SHIPPING.(see&quot;SCHEDULE II, Serf aXTToT &quot;11 of &quot;Appendix &quot;G&quot;J MR. OLIVER STANLEY explained that,  as reported in Conclusion (10) of the 1st Meeting of the Committee,the Beard of Trade had issued warnings to merchant shipping to avoid proceeding to potentially dangerous ports or waters.      Under the Defence Regulations the Government now had powers to translate this warning into a definite prohibition, and Mr. Oliver Stanley asked whether the time had not come when the Committee should decide to enforce this prohibition.      Furthermore, he suggested that the area ought to be extended to include not only the Baltic but also the Dutch and Danish ports, and possibly the Mediterranean.SIR DUDLEY POUND considered that it was also desirable that merchant shipping should be routed in the Atlantic fram now on.CONCLUSION.THE * COMMITTEE agreed:-(34)    To authorise the Admiralty,  in consultation with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade,  to adopt the compulsory naval control of movements of merchant shipping which, subject to the agreement of the Foreign Office,  should extend to Baltic, Dutch, Danish and Mediterranean ports, and should include the rouicing of ships in the Atlantic.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I., 25th August, 1939.K D.M.(39),  1st Meeting.
APPENDIX. ANNEX TO D.P.(P)  54.Draft Telegram to United Kingdom High commissioners in Dominions.As will have been seen from recent Circular B telegrams the international situation has become exceedingly acute.    There is a distinct possibility that in the near, future it v/ill be necessary to institute the Precautionary Stage here, or, without formal institution of the Precautionary Stage, to take certain of the precautionary measures provided for in the War Book, especially as regards naval matters.    In either event we should probably be sending to Dominion Governments some or all of the pre-arranged telegrams contained in Oversea Defence Committee memorandum 664-M.    Please inform Dominion Government in such manner as you think best in order    that they may be prepared, for receipt of such telegrams and meanwhile expedite consideration of what&apos;action it is possible for them to take.    If your approach to Dominion Government should elicit any information as to extent to which they would be likely to co-operate in War Book measures in the    event of these being put into force here, please let us know as soon as possible.
