THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1939,SECRET. Copy No.CP. 169 (39).CABINET.THE INDIAN FEDERATION.Negotiations with the Indian States as to the Terms of their Accession.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.A YEAR ago I circulated to my colleagues a memorandum (CP. 180 (38)) proposing that certain terms for the accession of the Indian States to Federation should be communicated to the Rulers. The Cabinet, on the 27th July, 1938, agreed that I should authorise the Viceroy toproceed accordingly, and after oral explanations had been given to certain leading Princes and States Ministers of the main features of the proposed Instrument of Accession, the Viceroy, in a circular letter of the 27th January (Annexure 1), forwarded to all Rulers eligible to accede the drafts of the relevant documents specified in paragraph 4 of his letter for their consideration and a reply within six months. The Viceroy emphasized that there was no prospect of any material variation of the terms then indicated in the direction of securing for the States any smaller surrender of powers to the Federation.2. The Viceroy&apos;s offer is still under consideration by the Princes, the time-limit having been extended to the 1st September. It is only when the replies of the Princes have been received and considered that a full appreciation of the position will be possible and a decision in regard to our policy in the matter of the establishment of Federation will require to be taken. Meanwhile, however, my colleagues will wish to have some account of developments since the offer was communicated and of the provisional conclusions in regard to policy on which the Viceroy and I are agreed.3. An informal Committee of Ministers of some of the leading Indian States has met at various times, while discussions regarding Federation have been in progress, under the presidency of Sir Akbar Hydari of Hyderabad State, in order to co-ordinate the views of States and advise the Rulers on policy. This Committee submitted to the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes in April a report of their examination of the proposed terms of accession in so far as these affected all States alike. The Committee&apos;s report has not been formally com-municated to Government, but was circulated by the Chancellor to the Rulers generally. This report and the report of a meeting of representatives of certain other States not associated with the Ministers&apos; Committee which was held at Gwalior came before a widely representative meeting of Rulers and Ministers held in Bombay in June, at which a Resolution was carried without opposition and communicated to the Indian Press in the following terms : &apos;&apos; The Conference of Princes and Ministers assembled at Bombay, having considered the revised draft Instrument of Accession and connected papers, resolves : That the terms on the basis of which accession is offered are fundamentally unsatisfactory in the direction indicated in the Report of the Hydari Committee of Ministers and confirmed by recommenda-tions of the Gwalior Conference, and are therefore unacceptable.At the same time the Conference records its belief that it could not be the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to close the door on an All-India Federation.&apos;&apos;
In the light of this Resolution the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes has circulated to Rulers the skeleton draft of a reply (Annexure 2) which he recom-mends them to return to the Viceroy&apos;s communication. The Nizam of Hyderabad has already communicated to the Viceroy, in a letter of the 9th June (Annexure 3), his reply to the Federal Offer. There was some evidence that the conclusions of the Bombay Conference were not reached unanimously. Certain of those attending abstained from voting in favour of the Resolution, and the Viceroy is inclined to think that some of the Rulers and their Ministers may have second thoughts about the policy of rejecting the proposed terms of accession. After discussion with the Chancellor of the Chamber (the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar) and with certain Rulers in Northern India who have asked for more time to consider the Federal proposals, the Viceroy has announced that the time for returning replies to his letter is extended to the 1st September. He considers that in the interval there may be a reaction among a number of Rulers, including those of certain important States whose accession would possibly exercise considerable influence on the attitude of Waverers, towards a more favourable reception of his proposals. At the same time we have to face the possibility that for the present Hyderabad at any rate will not accede, and that when the offer expires a sufficient number of favourable replies to the Viceroy&apos;s letter will not have been received to comply with the condition specified in section 5 (2) of the Government of India Act for establishing Federation, namely, that States repre-sented by 52 out of the 100 possible States members of the Council of State, and whose aggregate population amounts to at least half the total population of the States, accede to the Federation on terms acceptable to His Majesty.4. It was announced in Parliament on the 8th June, in accordance with the Viceroy&apos;s recommendation, that His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplated the publication or a White Paper on the subject of the terms of accession after the replies of Rulers to the Viceroy&apos;s letter had been received. There has been some Parliamentary interest in the contents of the Hydari Committee&apos;s Report, but this, it has been explained, was a report addressed to the Rulers of States which His Majesty&apos;s Government have no reason to believe will be published before the replies of individual Rulers have been received by the Crown Representative. Owing to the extension of the time-limit, it will now not be possible to arrive at a firm estimate of the position much before September. But when the offer has finally expired we shall have to publish a White Paper on the subject in fulfilment of the undertaking to Parliament referred to above. I do not propose to discuss in detail the terms offered to the States, of which a brief summary was given in my Memorandum CP. 180 (38), but I should describe the three main points on which they have founded their objections.5. Treaty rights. The position in regard to the rights claimed by States in matters for which they acceded was explained in a memorandum circulated with the Viceroy&apos;s letter of the 27th January (Annexure 4). It is evident from paragraph 4 of the Nizam&apos;s letter and paragraph 5 of the Chancellor&apos;s skeleton draft (Annexure 2) that, despite this explanation and the proposed Instruction to the Governor-General in regard to his special responsibility for the protection of States&apos; rights which was also circulated (Annexure 5), the States are much dissatisfied with the position as stated. Sovereigns from Queen Victoria to King George V in proclamations to the Indian Princes and people gave an assurance of their intentions to maintain unimpaired the Princes&apos; privileges, rights and dignities. The States have professed to discover a change in the attitude of Government in this respect; the Nizam in particular in paragraph 5 of his letter (Annexure 3) stresses the importance of the treaties relating to the defence of his State, which he considers not to be assured beyond question under the present proposals, and he doubts how far our obligations to defend the States can be relied on to remain part of the functions of the Governor-General independent of his Ministers. It will be recalled that the Princes have for a period of years past been in controversy with the Paramount Power on the question of the interpretation of their Treaties. A Committee presided over by the late Sir Harcourt Butler which enquired in 1928-29 into the grievances of the Princes held that Pafamountcy could not be defined, and that on Paramountcy alone could the States rely for their preservation. Certain Princes, on the other hand, pressed Lord Halifax and Lord Willingdon to institute a system Avhereby any question in dispute regarding the interpretation of treaties should be referred
as a matter of course to arbitration, and that the Paramount Power should accept the decision so obtained.    The same Princes, among whom Hyderabad and Bikaner  are included,  have consistently  pressed  for  the  inclusion  in the Instrument of Accession of a comprehensive statement of their rights in the sphere of all matters for which they accede, having in view the object that in case of dispute and of a verdict favourable to them by the Federal Court, Govern-ment would be compelled automatically to maintain the Court&apos;s decision.   This legalistic view of rights is at variance with the practice of Paramountcy in the past.   Government has hitherto always claimed in the last resort to say what are the rights of States and to judge how best such rights can be preserved. It is owing to the changed position under Federation that matters affecting States&apos; rights which hitherto did not come within the purview of a Central Legislature in India will be brought within its jurisdiction, and that the only means of varying its decisions in such matters will be through the exercise by the Governor-General of his special responsibility &quot; for the protection of the rights of any Indian State.&quot;   The Princes, and particularly the Nizam of Hyderabad, whose territories have been subjected since the beginning of the year to a con-tinuous stream of Hindu immigrants from British India with the avowed object of committing civil disobedience in protest against his religious laws affecting Hindu worship, now profess to have a considerable distrust of the willingness, if not of the power, of Provincial Governors to interpose, in virtue of their special responsibility, obstacles to the campaign of intimidation which has been directed against Rulers from British India.   I addressed my colleagues in regard to this-matter in my memorandum (CP. 44 (39)) of February last on Congress and the Indian States.   It is sufficient here for me to say that the campaign to which 7. then referred, while it has decreased in intensity in most States, is still being vigorously directed against Hyderabad.    There can be no question that the attitude of the States in the matter of Federation has been deeply affected by this campaign, from which they profess to discern a deep hostility in British India towards their rule which would render them unwelcome as partners in an Indian Federation.   It would be idle to pretend that the institution of provincial autonomy, and the emergence in the majority of the Provinces of Congress Governments strongly critical of the Rulers&apos; methods of administration and insistent on the recognition of the right of States&apos; peoples to be consulted on the form of their government, and in particular on the choice of States&apos; represen-tatives in a Federal Legislature, has not made much more difficult the literal observance by the Paramount Power of its treaty obligations to protect the Rulers from all disturbance from within or without in their administration.   There have been certain cases in which the disturbances which have occurred, although mainly initiated by interested parties in British India, have had their origin in legitimate grievances.  But on the whole the administration in the States has not been such as to justify intervention by the Paramount Power on the ground that conditions in them amount to gross misrule.   Nevertheless, I have agreed with the Viceroy that the present-day conditions, in which the States are brought into much closer contact than heretofore with political conditions in British India, demand a certain stiffening of the standards of government required of the Rulers by the Paramount Power.   The Viceroy has instructed his officers, and in his speeches has warned the Rulers, that the latter are expected to enquire promptly into the grievances of their people and to provide recognised channels through which these grievances can be heard and redressed.   The form of the administration may differ between State and State in accordance with the standard of education and political development, but it is no longer possible to extend protection to a Ruler against agitation without requiring to be fully satisfied that the genuine grievances of his people are being progressively removed.6. The treaties and agreements with the States cover a very wide field. They range from such solemn promises as those embodied in treaties of long&quot; standing to protect the Ruler&apos;s dynasty against external aggression or internal rebellion, coupled in the case of Hyderabad and certain other States with definite undertakings always to maintain locally a certain quota of troops for their special defence, to special agreements made with States from time to time contracting to pay annually certain sums in return for the abandonment by a State of its former practice of levying transit duties on salt or of developing salt mines. Another class are agreements whereby States may retain a proportion of the customs duty levied at their own ports on goods which cross the frontier duty free
for consumption in British India. Some of the treaties were negotiated in the early days of the establishment of British rule in India as between equal Powers, but some agreements have been negotiated very recently, even since the passing of the Government of India Act, with the object of determining long standing economic disputes, particularly in the field of sea customs. While, generally speaking, the treaties do not provide for periodical revision, but are perpetual in form, many of their provisions have in practice undergone substantial revision from time to time, and this has not necessarily always been to the disadvantage of the States. Nevertheless, in order to prevent inroads by British India on their treaty rights, the States desire to secure from the Crown a fresh assurance of the sanctity of their treaties and at the same time stipulate that their accession to Federation must be on conditions enabling them to make specific reservations, which would in effect become part of the Federal constitution, in respect of particular rights relating to matters for which they agree to federate, such as Defence, Customs, Excise or the like.7. In the political circumstances obtaining in India, particularly since the passage of the Government of India Act, it would be misleading to all parties were the Crown to renew in the terms used in previous reigns the unqualified assurance that the rights of States are &quot; inviolable and inviolate.&quot; On the other hand, a basis of good faith in this matter is requisite not only on the part of the Crown, but also on the part of the States. Some of these rights have already, irrespective of Federation, come to be challenged in particular cases, mainly in the economic field, as unconscionable, even though others, such as the right of Hindu Rulers to adopt an heir and the right of all Rulers to expect their dynasties to be upheld, will doubtless survive intact. It would, however, be impossible to negotiate any agreement with the Rulers if they entered on the negotiation with nothing but distrust of the Crowifs will or capacity to keep its promises. On the other hand, it is necessary for Rulers to accept the fact that there have been and will be variations of practice in dealing with them amounting to modification of some of the Crown&apos;s former undertakings. These adjustments are most likely to be required in future in the case of matters which are intended to be Federal. Here the anomalous financial privileges granted at the expense of Central revenues to certain States, however justifiable at the time they were conceded, would be found to prove a standing source of dispute between those States and the Federation as a whole. Such disputes, it has been thought, would inevitably lead to political deadlock were particular pre-Federation rights of the States to be declared by legal pronouncements of the Federal Court to have been infringed by some action of the Federal Government and Legislature. Thus, it has been held undesirable on general political grounds to embed such rights in the constitution by allowing them to be reserved in the Instrument of Accession and placed within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. It has seemed more prudent to leave to the Governor-General the task of reconciling conflicting interests and claims when such disputes occur, by such, adjustments as the parties can agree to accept. The States cannot expect that the Governor-General, in the exercise of his special responsibility, would always be prepared to maintain their rights without modification. It is, indeed, hardly to be expected that it would be politically possible in all cases to maintain at the expense of Central revenues the privileged position of States which refuse to accede to Federation. The means of implementing the Crown&apos;s obligations to the States has necessarily been affected by the passage of the Government of India Act. To this the Rulers cannot be blind. The explanatory memorandum on the protection of States&apos; rights (Annexure 4) seems to afford as fair a statement of the position as the States can expect and Government is in a position to give, and there appears no room for any wide compromise with them in this regard. I am examining with the Viceroy the possibility of allowing certain States to reserve certain rights in their Instruments of Accession which we had previously agreed did not merit this treatment. The Viceroy hopes that some adjustments of this nature might have a considerable effect on the attitude towards accession of an important group of States with customs privileges. At present consultations are still in progress, and it is uncertain how far legal and practical considerations would permit us to go in this direction. The most effective reply to the States in this matter seems to be that outside the Federation they will necessarily always remain, as now, exposed to British Indian criticism and attack upon their financial privileges at the expense of Central revenues, whereas within a Federation they would have
power, through the generous representation accorded to them in the Legislature, to defend their own case and to bring pressure to bear on the Executive either to maintain their rights intact or to exchange them by agreement for other advantages less open to attack. In these economic questions there must be give and take, and thus only would it be possible effectively to preserve the ultimate rights of States to live and of the dynasties to be perpetuated.8. Administration. In section 125 of the Government of India Act provision has been made for the making of agreements with Rulers for their exercise of functions in relation to the administration in their States of any law of the Federal Legislature which applies therein, subject to inspection by the Governor-General in his discretion. The origin of this provision is the general wish expressed by the representatives of States at the Round Table Conference and in the discussions of the Joint Committee that the legislative function of the Federation, so far as it affected a State, should be confined to regulating Federal matters in general terms, but that all power to put Federal Acts into operation should remain in the hands of the Rulers themselves and their own officials. In other words, they laid great stress on their determination that, if the Federation employed in British India its own officials (e.g., a Customs service), such officials should be excluded from any State which federated for that matter. After full consideration of the Rulers&apos; point of view, it was held to be impossible to make agreements with States differentiating absolutely between them and Provinces in this respect in such a way that where in a Province the administration of a Federal law, e.g., in regard to Post Offices, Customs or Railways, would be A^ested in officers of the Central Government and not in officials of the Provincial Services acting as Federal agents, all such functions in a State would be performed by State officials. The proposal made to the States (Annexure 6) was what seemed to be as generous a measure of devolution as they could expect. What was reserved to be administered by Provincial officers in the three major Provinces would be similarly reserved to State officials in States. But this proposal falls far short of meeting the wishes of the States. First, they evidently distrust the presence in the States, as explained in the Nizam&apos;s letter to the Viceroy (Annexure 3), of officials owning allegiance to a Federal rather than to their own Government. Secondly, they still wish executive authority to be vested in States&apos; Governments and not merely that State officials should exercise authority conferred by a Federal Act subject to the control of a Federal Department. The Act itself has given to the States unqualified operative control of railway systems owned by the State, and in the case of Hyderabad, with its 1,290 miles of railways, this is a substantial concession to the States&apos; claims. But the Nizam desires to exclude from the Railway Authority of the Federation power to fix minimum rates and fares, interchange of traffic and other adminis-trative functions not regulated by legislation, holding that this Authority might so operate its powers as to further the interests of Federal railways at the expense of those of the State. It is conceivable that Hyderabad might be accommodated by some small adjustments in this matter, though it is difficult to find means of doing so without seriously prejudicing the uniformity of the administration of Federal law.9. Financial and Economic Conditions. The States have frequently expressed their apprehension that under Federation certain of their existing sources of revenue would dry up, while the cost of administration would increase and new fiscal obligations to the Centre would have been undertaken. Their suspicions seem to be deepest in regard to the following matters :  (a) The provisions of S. 138 (3) of the Government of India Act, which provide, in case of emergency, for the levy of a surcharge on income tax in States though otherwise exempt from ordinary income tax, and the proposed method of assessment of such a tax set out in the draft Order in Council circulated to Rulers (Annexure 7).(b) The   requirement   that  they   should   accede   for   &quot; development   ofindustries&quot; (Government of India Act, Schedule VII, List 1, entry 34). States have been informed that the only limitation which could be permitted would be that in the case of certain specified industries no Federal law could extend in its application to a State beyond the conduct or the fostering of research, the dissemination of skill and knowledge, the provision of raw material, assistance in
the production or facilities for the marketing of products, and the imposition of cesses for providing funds for any of the purposes aforesaid. It has been contemplated that, where a State of importance pressed very strongly that such a limitation should not be restricted to specified industries, this might be accorded, and to this limited extent there is means of removing the present suspicion founded on the assumption that the Federation will endeavour to develop its own industries to the exclusion of existing or nascent State industries. (c) In clause 3 of the India and Burma (Miscellaneous) Amendments Bill, which has been passed in the House of Lords, it is proposed to amend the entries in the Federal Legislative List relating to Import and Export and to Customs in such manner as to empower the Federal Legislature to impose barriers on trade crossing the boundaries of any unit of the Federation as.well as on the external frontier of the Federation. The reasons for this amendment are that in various ways the units of the Federation might otherwise seek to obtain unfair advantages over other units. For example, Provinces as well as States could subsidise their industries. States would not be subject to the same control by the Federation as would Provinces in regard to the regulation of labour conditions or in the organization and control of industry. It has therefore seemed desirable that the Federation should have power to impose a customs barrier round a unit in order to check any unfair competition from these causes. A further consideration is that, as part of the new customs agreements which it is proposed to make with maritime States as a condition of their entry into the Federation, the Federation should retain, for use if necessary to protect the customs revenue, the existing right of the Central Government to levy duties on goods imported at the ports of such States which enter British India. States are apprehensive that these powers might be used to check their legitimate economic development. It is, however, intended that their exercise would be regulated by the Governor-General in his discretion and that the manner in which he should exercise his discretion would be laid down in a paragraph to be inserted in his Instrument of Instruction. The draft of this paragraph, which was communicated to the States on the 6th June, is reproduced below as Annexure 8. It will be seen that the exercise of the powers in question would be subject to the Governor-General&apos;s obligation to protect the rights of States, including the obligation to prevent any action which threatens or tends to threaten their economic life, and that the Governor-General would be required to bear in mind the injurious effects of impediments to the free movement of commodities throughout the Federation. The Instruction would also provide for the rights of States to levy customs duties on goods entering or leaving their own territories, which it is proposed to allow them to preserve by limita-tions, being restricted to what they now obtain from this source.10. In the Nizanfs letter to the Viceroy (Annexure 3) certain other points are taken which it is not necessary to discuss here in detail. Similar points of detail will no doubt be raised in the replies from other States. Whatever may be the attitude of those States which follow the leadership of Bikaner, there is reason to think that certain of the big States, such as Mysore, Baroda and Travancore, while professing considerable dissatisfaction at the terms offered, will leave no doubt as to their willingness to consider favourably terms slightly amended to meet their individual wishes. But there is at present no certainty that, by adjustment of certain of the terms proposed to the very limited extent which seems possible, any very material effect would be produced on the disposi-tion of a large body of the States of the second rank to avoid committing them-selves at this stage to early accession. The breathing space which the States have been given by the extension to the 1st September of the time-limit for their replies may produce a salutary reaction. But it is unlikely that Hyderabad, immersed in its internal troubles with Hindu agitation, will at present withdraw its refusal to accede on the terms offered.
11. The tactics adopted at the Bombay Conference are difficult to explain on logical grounds, but it is clear that the States have been profoundly affected by their realization of the power in the hands of Congress Governments in the Provinces to interfere with their internal administration, and that this realiza-tion, although strictly irrelevant to consideration of the pros and cons of accession to Federation, has nevertheless caused them to fear that the policy of the Governor-General in matters in which he will use his discretion or individual judgment will on political grounds be more favourable to the retention of a Federal Ministry, however hostile to States&apos; interests, than to the protection of the rights which they have hitherto been recognised to possess. While the States probably realize that the Governor-Generals power to protect their rights would be no greater if they remained outside the Federation than if they should accede, they may think that by withholding their accession at this stage they will stiffen the determination of Government to intervene in their defence against aggressive action from British India, even if this were to result in the resignation of Congress ministries.12. My discussions with the Viceroy as regards our policy in the light of the present reaction to the terms of the Federal offer are still proceeding. His Excellency&apos;s main conclusion,&apos; with which I agree, is that the scheme of the Act, despite the setback represented by the Resolution passed at the Bombay Conference, still holds the field. It is far from certain that the Princes intend to close the door, or that some minor accommodation, on the basis of the scheme of the Act, and of the Federal offer as indicated to them, will not be possible when their individual replies have been received and considered, when the White Paper has been published and when the reactions of the British Indian public to the contents of the White Paper have had time to operate. We must anticipate that certain of the terms offered to the States, although regarded by Rulers as insufficiently attractive, will evoke widespread criticism in British Indian circles. For example, the States regard the concession permitting them to retain what they collect under present arrangements from excises on sugar and matches as insufficiently generous, because in the case of sugar it is limited to the amounts collected from the year 1936-37, that is to say, before some States had established sugar factories (see in this connexion paragraph 8 of my memo-randum of the 21st July, 1938 (CP. 180 (38)). On the other hand&apos;, it will be widely held in British India that the Princes were entitled to no such concession at all, and that all the proceeds of Federal excises should be available to the Centre. Again, if, as seems possible, the proposals regarding adminis-tration agreements have to be adjusted to give some concession to the big States, British India will necessarily be critical of the States being allowed to administer Federal matters where this is denied to the Provinces. Generally speaking, it will be represented that the terms have been so adjusted as to provide induce-ments to the States to enter Federation which were not contemplated when the proposals were discussed at the Round Table Conference and in Parlia-ment. But in British India, while among certain elements of Congress there is no doubt a disposition to accept Federation as a jumping-off ground to a more satisfactory means of obtaining power in a responsible government at the Centre, this very fact has stiffened the objections of the Muslims as a minority-community to Federation. The Viceroy is not disposed to attach decisive weight to the Muslim opposition should the States as a whole revise their attitude. But, failing some considerable change in the present Muslim point of view, Provinces which have Muslim ministries might well make difficulties about the inauguration of Federation.13. It must be admitted that the Princes have played their hand remarkably badly. They could have avoided the appearance of turning down the Federal offer in its present terms out of fear of the consequences of closer association with British India by making more of their specific claims and less of their distrust of the power of the Crown to protect them against exploitation or aggression from British India. I gather from the Viceroy that the Chancellor of the Princes&apos; Chamber has admitted that a mistake in tactics may have been made, though he maintains the importance attached by his Order to the points discussed in paragraphs 5-9 above. As it is, the Bombay resolution did not get a good reception in India as a whole.   The European and more moderate
journals underlined the fact that the Princes had not rejected Federation out of hand, and that there was still room for adjustment of differences. Congress comment was mainly devoted to criticising the disposition of the States to bargain to maintain autocracy. But a number of prominent politicians have underlined the mistaken attitude of the States in rejecting a good offer which is hardly likely to be repeated. However, all such criticisms are necessarily provisional, pending publication of the actual terms proposed.14. A further question of substantial importance is the date of publication of the White Paper and what that paper should contain. The replies of individual States are now not due to be received before the 1st September. There seems little advantage in publishing merely the terms of the Offer without a summary of and selections from the States&apos; replies. Hence, I am in full agree-ment with the view of the Viceroy that the White Paper should not be laid until time has been given for a cool consideration of the collective opinions of the States, and possibly for some further discussions with Rulers should they desire them. It is clearly too soon to say what the White Paper will have to contain, and I agree with the Viceroy that in the interval before its publication there may be a considerable reaction in the States in favour of a more objective view of the advantages of accession.15. I am accordingly in agreement with the Viceroy&apos;s conclusion that the existing situation does not call for immediate consideration of alternatives to the Federal scheme. I accept his opinion that it is possible to carry on for the time being with the present irresponsible Centre, although clearly there must be a limit to the time during which the present transitional arrangements can be made to work effectively, and there is also for consideration the question whether the present Central Assembly can have its life much prolonged. If in the next two months the Princes&apos; attitude does not alter materially, we may have to consider whether the situation calls for consultation between the Viceroy, the leaders of the parties in British India, and the Princes, with a view to seeking some basis of accommodation. Here, again, however, I am in agreement with the Viceroy that at present such a step would prove of little value in advancing matters. There is no question that in British India the Muslims would demand concessions to ensure them against oppression by a Congress majority, and Congress would seize the opportunity to press for greater control than the Act contemplates over finance, defence, and conceivably foreign affairs, while the Princes would make themselves more unpopular in British Indian circles by demanding additional safeguards against attacks on their rights from British India. Hence, there is considerable reason for apprehending that such a Conference would, at least at the present stage, result in driving the parties concerned further apart, rather than in drawing them closer together. Moreover, it would be embarrassing to the Viceroy to hold such a Conference without knowing how far His Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament were prepared to go to meet claims advanced on which an agreement between the parties had been reached. Accordingly, I agree with the Viceroy that his action at this stage could not profitably go further than the taking of informal soundings of prominent leaders in British India and among the Princes as to the means of achieving some basis of co-operation.16. I will summarise this appreciation of the position in regard to the Federal offer to the Princes as follows :  (i) The Viceroy&apos;s letter communicating confidentially to Rulers proposed terms of accession to Federation issued on the 27th January. The time-limit of six months for replies has since been extended at certain Princes&apos; request to the 1st September.(ii) I have undertaken to lay a White Paper on the subject after the Princes&apos; replies have been received.(iii) The period of consideration of the Offer by the Princes has coincided with a sustained campaign of agitation by States&apos; peoples encouraged by Congress in British India in a very large proportion of the States. The agitation has been for internal reforms, particularly in the sphere of taxation and representative institutions. One of tire chief objects has been to secure the concession of popular election of the Rulers&apos; representatives in the Federal Legislature. This develop-ment, in so far as the stimulus has come from British India, has had a prejudicial effect on the reception of the Offer by the Princes.
(iv) The Princes&apos; criticisms of the Offer, to which public attention was drawn by their recent resolution passed at Bombay, is directed against the following main points :  (a) inadequate provision for the protection of their existing treaty rights;(b) the lack of provision for protection against subversive movements fromBritish Indian provinces against States; .  - (c) the new financial burdens which Federation would impose on the States; (d) the refusal to provide for the complete exclusion of Federal officers from the administration of Federal matters in the States.Of these criticisms the greatest stress has been laid upon the first.(v) The terms of accession offered are at present confidential. But with their publication it is to be expected that there will be considerable criticism from British India that they are over-generous to the Princes and do not provide for Federation on a basis of equal distribution of obligations as between the Provinces and the States.(vi) Whereas the right wing of the Congress under Mr. Gandhi&apos;s leadership see advantage in the early establishment of Federation, subject to popular repre-sentation from the States rather than by Princely nominees, the Muslim minority community has hitherto shown itself strongly opposed to the grant of responsible government at the Centre, owing to the risk that this will bring the Congress and a Hindu majority into power.(vii) In agreement with the Viceroy, I do not consider that the existing situa-tion calls for any immediate revision of our policy. There is some reason to hope that the Princes may in the course of the next two months revise their first impressions of the Federal offer and that the prospects of establishing Federation will improve. In the interval there is nothing to be done but to be patient. The recent moderation of the campaign of Congress agitation in States may also affect the Princes&apos; attitude.(viii) The Princes were warned in the Viceroy&quot;s offer, and the warning has been repeated in private to individual States&apos; representatives, that there can be no radical modifications of the Offer. Nevertheless, in certain minor particulars it may be possible by adjustments to facilitate the accession of certain leading States and so influence the attitude of the Rulers as a whole towards accession.(ix) If the Princes withdraw their present opposition to the terms offered and agree to accede, the opposition to Federation in British India may be expected to be considerably reduced. But it is too early to predict how soon it would be possible to bring the Federal scheme into effect.

A considerable interval has elapsed since the discussions held in the winter of 1936-37 between representatives of States and my Special Repre-sentatives and the receipt thereafter of communications from States as to the terms on which they would wish their accession to be subject should they subsequently decide to accede to the Federation. This interval has been occupied by an exhaustive study of the points which emerged from those discussions and of the desires expressed by States. The subjects brought forward were numerous and diverse and the issues involved in many cases of great importance and com-complexity, calling for careful consideration. It was inevitable therefore that a considerable period should have been occupied by this examination, conducted in India by myself as Crown Representative in close and confidential consultation with the Government of India and in England by His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. As a result of this study I am now in a position to indicate the terms which His Majesty&apos;s Government would think it necessary that an Instrument ofYour Exalted Highness Accession executed by       Your Highness       should contain in order to fulfil theyourequirements subject to which it would be submitted for His Majesty&apos;s acceptance. [In the case of Your Highness&apos; State, however, the terms now indicated are, as is shown in the appropriate place in the relevant enclosure to this letter, not yet complete in respect of the form and extent of accession on Customs and other connected entries of the Federal Legislative List; the question of resolving the existing position in respect of customs in Your Highness&apos; State to one compatible with accession to the Federation and of formulating in accordance therewith the exact terms of accession on the relevant entries of the Federal Legislative List will be dealt with separately. It is hoped that it will shortly be possible for discussions on the subject to take place with Your Highness&apos; representatives. Subject to this]* it is necessary for me to emphasize that the terms now indicated must be regarded in all essentials as incapable of further relaxation since they represent the furthest point to which, after the fullest consideration of all the* The passage in brackets was included only in the letters sent to the Rulers of eleven States possessing rights connected with sea customs.

Hissues involved, among which the securing of the welfare and interests of the States was prominently in their mind, His Majesty&apos;s Government have found it possible to go to meet the wishes or apprehensions expressed by States. Accession to any substantially less degree could not, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, be sufficient qualification to entitle a State to become a unit, and enjoy the benefits of membership, of the Federation contemplated by the Act.4.   The terms in question and the position in regard to matters relevant thereto are indicated and where necessary explained in the enclosed documents :   (A) the draft of the general clauses of the Instrument of Accession ;* (B), (C) and (D) the draft of the three Schedules to the Instrument of Accession;(E) the draft Acceptance by His Majesty;(F) two draft paragraphs for the Instrument of Instructions to the Governor-General, one to replace paragraph XV of the draft Instructions presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for India in February 1935, and the other an additional paragraph;(G) the draft Instrument of Instructions to the Crown Representative;(H) the draft Order in Council contemplated by Section 138 (3) of the Act;(I) a note regarding amendments to the Act;(J) a note regarding the administration of Federal laws in Federated States (this must be read with the Third Schedule mentioned in (D) above; and(K) a note regarding States&apos; rights.Your Exalted Highness 5.   I fully appreciate that       Your Highness       will wish for time toyou &apos;study these terms and to consider their implications, and I have no desire to ask you to arrive at a decision in this important matter without full opportunity for the reflection which it deserves. In the circumstances I am now asking Your Exalted HighnessYour Highness        to inform me at any time within the next six months .......    youwhether you would be prepared to execute an Instrument of Accession on behalf of your State within the terms indicated in documents (A)-(D) mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The term &quot; within &quot; has been designedly used, since there are various matters in which an option has been given; moreover, although His Majesty&apos;s Government might well be prepared when the time comes to recommend that a State should be admitted to the Federation if its accession is confined to the matters now shown as obligatory and if it avails itself of all the limitations now indicated as admissible (whether or not that State has itself asked, in its earlier communications, for any particular limitation), it may yet be the case that States may wish to accede more fully in respect of the various legislative entries or to dispense with some or all of the limitations specified.   I should make itYour Exalted Highness clear that      Your Highness      is not&quot; being asked to draw up and execute an youInstrument of Accession at this stage.   Further action in this respect will beYour Exalted Highness&apos;taken only after the receipt of      Your Highness&apos;       reply.   But to facilitateyourthe drawing up of the Instrument in the event of Your Highness expressing your willingness to accede to the Federation within the terms offered, I would request that the following matters may be borne in mind in framing your reply, should you decide to accede : (a) In regard to the general clauses of the Instrument of Accession it will be necessary to specify whether the inclusion of clause 4A is desired and, if so, to make the selection dealt with in the note regarding the administration of federal laws (document (J) in the preceding paragraph). It will also be necessary to specify whether the inclusion of clause 4B is desired. As regards clause 4C a further communica-tion will be made hereafter to any State in which there is an area in* Enclosures (Fj, (H), (J) and (K) only have been reproduced as Annexures 5, 8, 6 and&apos;4 respectively.
respect of which a declaration under Section 294 (1) is to be made, and this clause will not find a place in the Instrument of any State to which no such communication is made. (6) In regard to the First Schedule it is necessary to specify the wishes of the State on the matters in respect of which this necessity is indicated in the notes against them. In the event, further, of Your Exalted HighnessYour Highness       desiring to accede more fully in any respect youor not to take advantage of any of the limitations set out, the desire should be precisely stated.Your Exalted Highness(c) In the event of Your Highness        wishing to enter into the.&apos;T0U .separate agreement relating to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court mentioned in paragraph 5 of the note on State&apos;s rights (document (K) in the preceding paragraph), it will be necessary to state this and to specify the documents to be scheduled.6. In conclusion I must again emphasize that there is no prospect of any substantial variation of the terms now indicated in the direction of allowing a less measure of accession than what is shown therein or of modifying or addingYour Exalted Highnessto the limitations specified.    Should       Your Highness       however desire. you to satisfy yourself as to the reasons for any particular suggestions of your State not having been accepted, or having been accepted in a modified form, or for any changes made in the draft of the Instrument of Accession which was furnished to States by the Government of India in 1936, my local Political RepresentativeYour Exalted Highnesswill be happy to have a discussion with       Your Highness       or your officersyouat some convenient time and to explain then any such points on which information may be sought.Your Exalted Highness 7.   I would request       Your Highness       to be good enough to issueyouinstructions to the effect that the contents of this letter and the accompanying documents should for the present be treated as strictly confidential.Yours sincerely,LINLITHGOW.ANNEXURE 2.Office of His Highness the Chancellor, Chamber of Princes. (Confidential.   Urgent.)Re : The Revised Draft of the Instrument of A ccession and connected Papers.Your Highness, take  Mahal Hotel, Bombay, June 18, 1939.IN accordance with the decision of our General Conference held in Bombay in November 1938 and confirmed by our Informal Meetings in Delhi preceding the last Chamber Session, the General Conference of Rulers and representatives met recently in Bombay to consider the Revised Draft Instrument and connected papers in the light of the Report of the Hydari Committee and other available material. This conference, Your Highness will be glad to learn, was fully repre-sentative of the Rulers and Representatives of States big and small. The Rulers and Representatives present at the Conference included States with a population of about 71 per cent, of the aggregate population of the States and
with a representation of about 67 per cent, of the total number of seats allotted to the States in the proposed Upper Federal House. These figures are particularly significant because, in accordance with section 5 of the Government of India Act, 1935, the Federal Scheme can only come into being if the States with at least half of the total population of the States and having 52 members (out of the total States quota of 104) in the Federal Upper House convey their readiness to accede; in other words, both these conditions have to be fulfilled before Federation can be set up in accordance with the scheme embodied in the Government of India Act, 1935. The fact that the States under minority or under administra-tion carry about 8 seats in the proposed Federal Upper House and these seats cannot be counted towards making up of the 52 seats in the Federal Upper House whose accession is a condition precedent to the introduction of the Federal Scheme, lends further importance to the decision of the Bombay Conference.2. The Conference has had a free and frank exchange of views over the general and political aspects as well as on the detailed provisions of the Revised Draft Instrument and connected papers. Its decision is embodied in the following resolution adopted at the Conference:  &quot; The Conference of Princes and Ministers assembled, having considered the Revised Draft Instrument of Accession and the connected papers, resolves That the terms on the basis of which accession is offered are funda-mentally unsatisfactory in the direction indicated in the Report of the Hydari Committee of Ministers and confirmed by the recommendations of the Gwalior Conference, and are therefore unacceptable.-At the same time, the Conference records its belief that it could not be the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to close the door on an All-India Federation.&quot;It is significant that the Rulers present at the Conference were unanimous and that none of the accredited Representatives present voted against the Resolu-tion. This development bears eloquent testimony both to the spirit of farsighted compromise and unity shown by the Rulers and Representatives present, as well as to the fact that His Excellency the Crown Representative has not exerted any pressure to interfere with the unfettered discretion of the Rulers in the decision of this vital question.3. The aforesaid decision of the Conference was reached after the most anxious and earnest consideration of the problem before us with the fullest appreciation of our grave responsibility in this behalf. The Conference was impressed by the fact that the Hydari Committee and the Gwalior Conference independently reached conclusions which, on essentials, pointed in the same direction. The legal and other experts whose opinions had previously been invited endorsed the main conclusions of these Committees. The examination of the Revised Draft Instrument and connected papers by the Bombay Conference itself, in the light of all available material, further confirmed these conclusions, and prompted the decision cited above, which points out the main reasons for which the basis on which accession is now offered is unacceptable and leaves it to His^Majesty&apos;s Government and His Excellency the Crown Representative to take such further action as may be deemed fit.4. It was pointed out&apos; at the Conference that the States had throughout the federal negotiations made it clear that their decision to accede or not to accede, on the basis offered to them, would depend on the inclusion in the completed picture of the essential safeguards and conditions which they had consistently urged. Their faith in the ideal of an All-India Federation with essential safe-guards and enduring foundation was reiterated, Met the examination of the completed picture now before them showed that it did not specifically and effectively afford them protection with regard to their important safeguards and rights, and that without such protection it was apprehended that the Riders and their successors would find themselves unable, in the fast-changing circumstances of the country, to duly discharge their obligations to the Crown, to their dynasties and to their people. Moreover, it was felt that the basis now offered was, - both on political and financial grounds, unsatisfactory. The conclusions of the Conference regarding the detailed provisions of the Revised Draft and
connected -papers, including such matters as defence, treaty rights, and the extension of federal authority beyond what had hitherto been contemplated, are embodied in the summary of the proceedings of the Conference which are being forwarded to Your Highness in a separate cover. This resolution adopted by the Conference, on the basis of the aforesaid conclusions, has already been quoted in paragraph. 2 above.5. The Conference also resolved that the Standing Committee of Ministers, duly enlarged by the addition of other Ministers so as to make it fully represen-tative of the big and small States and of all shades of opinion, should draw up the draft of a. model reply, on the basis of the resolution of the Bombay Conference, to His Excellency the Crown Representative regarding the Revised Draft Instrument, which may be of assistance to the Rulers in preparing their individual replies. The draft reply prepared by this Committee is appended (Appendix 1). The Committee had the benefit of the advice of Mr. Manu Subedar in drafting the relevant clauses of the letter dealing with the financial provisions of the Revised Draft Instrument, and I have referred the Draft Reply to our legal adviser and invited his opinion thereon by air mail. Should his opinion suggest the necessity of any further reference arising out of the resolution adopted by the recent Conference, I shall address Your Highness accordingly.6. Your Highness doubtless appreciates the importance of the line of our reply to His Excellency the Crown Representative with regard to the vital question before us. The need for the Princes standing together at this juncture cannot be over-emphasised, and the fact that our recent Bombay Conference  which was fully representative came to the decision cited above, without any dissentient, speaks for itself. The next step now rests with the individual Rulers concerned.7. At my request, copies of the replies sent by individual States to the original Draft Instrument were supplied by most States to the Chancellors Secretariat. I shall be grateful, should there be no objection, if Your Highness would favour me with a copy of the reply to the Revised Draft which may be addressed by Your Highness to His Excellency the Crown Representative. It is understood that Your Highness&apos;s reply shall be treated strictly confidential. Trusting this finds Your Highness in the enjoyment of excellent health.Y&quot;ours sincerely,DIGVIJAY SINGHJI, Maharaja Jam Saheb of Nawanagar, Chancellor, Chamber of Princes.Appendix I.Draft reply to His Excellency the Crown Representative^ letter forwarding the Revised Draft of the Instrument of A ccession and connected papers.I AM addressing Your Excellency in reply to Your Excellency&apos;s letter, dated the 27th January, 1939, regarding the accession of my State to the Federation provided for in the Government of India Act, 1935. I greatly appreciate that a period of six months has been available to me to arrive at a decision on this important question. I am also grateful to Your Excellency for the completely unfettered discretion which you have been pleased to leave to me in this vital matter.2. Your Excellency has desired to be informed whether I would be prepared to execute an Instrument of Accession on behalf of my State within the terms indicated in documents (1) and (2) forwarded with the letter under reference. I have noted that the terms now offered must be regarded &quot;in all essentials as incapable of further relaxation since they represent the furthest point to which . . . . His Majesty&apos;s Government have found it possible to go to meet the wishes or apprehensions expressed by States.&quot; I assure Your Excellency that I have, with due regard to the observations made in Your Excellency&apos;s letter, given my most earnest consideration to the matter with the full consciousness of my grave reponsibility in this behalf.   I have carefully examined the various documents
forwarded with Your Excellency&apos;s letter under reference in the light of all available advice with every intention to be of assistance to Your Excellency in achieving the ideal of an All-India Federation.3. This examination, I regret to say, has led me to the conclusion that the terms on the basis of which accession is now offered are fundamentally unsatisfactory in the directions indicated in the report of the Informal (Hydari) Committee of Ministers and confirmed by the recommendations of the Conference of Ministers recently held at Gwalior copies of which have already been forwarded to Your Excellency by His Highness the Chancellor and are therefore unacceptable to me. I assure Your Excellency that it is with the greatest reluctance that I have come to this decision, but my relationship with the Crown and my duty to my successors and my people leave me no other course. In particular the directions in which I consider the terms offered to be fundamentally unsatisfactory are as follows : -(a) that the protection afforded for the rights of my State and the rights and dignity of the Ruler thereof, in the federal sphere as well as outside it, is not adequate and satisfactory;(&amp;) that section 125 of.the Act was specifically incorporated at the instance of the States to enable them to reserve executive authority and thus to differentiate between the States and the Provinces. The arrangements for the administration of federal laws proposed under the Revised Draft Instrument were not previously discussed with the States and unsatisfactory in so far as they are not in consonance with the terms of section 125 of the Act;(c) that the provisions of the Scheme affecting the economic and financial position of my State were unsatisfactory even in the Original Draft Instrument of Accession as indicated in the limitations suggested by me thereto. Many of these limitations general and specific-have been disallowed.*(Others, as drafted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, seeking to stabilise conditions and amounts as existing in 1936-37, will be unfair to my State.) *(The assumption of power to impose a Customs cordon round my State under the India and- Burma (Miscellaneous Amendments) Acts and certain other provisions thereof have worsened the Position.)*(There are clauses of the Government of India (States contributions in lieu of Federal surcharges) Order as drafted which appear to affect my State adversely. Your Excellency will permit me to point out that no opportunity was afforded for the expression of my views on the provisions of the Amending Act and Draft Order.) The interests of the State have been adversely affected by the insertion of Section 297-A (2), and the proposed additional paragraph in the Draft Instrument of Instructions to the Governor-General is unsatisfactory.I am advised that the cumulative effect of what has been stated above is that the economic and financial future of my State would be jeopardised if there were not considerable relaxation in some of these matters. The interests of good administration require that finance in the hands of the State should be less cir-cumscribed than what I find in the Scheme, and the betterment of the economic condition of my subjects would call for fuller scope for the exercise of powers by the State authorities than the provisions would permit.......(d) that the basis of accession now offered does not admit of necessary limitations with regard to certain important entries in the Federal Legislative List and does not provide adequately for the protection of the special rights of my State with regard to the following : There are also other matters of detail relating to the accession of my State to the proposed Federation which I find unsatisfactory but I have not considered it necessary to trouble your Excellency with regard to them in this letter.5. Further, may I invite your Excellency&apos;s attention to another important matter, which is exercising the minds of many Rulers and in which I feel confident that your Excellency&apos;s sympathies are with them? It has always been assumed that the internal autonomy of the units within the Federation would be respected. The legal structure of Federation is directed to this end and exists as much to protect the units within their fields as to give authority to the Centre in its own field.   Thus, for example, in answer to Query No. 7000, the then* Those States which do not consider themselves affected, need not insert the bracketed sentence.-  V - -   -
Secretary of State, the Rt. Hon&apos;ble Sir Samuel Hoare, replied : &quot; The whole basis of our Federal Scheme is that we do not interfere in the internal management of the States except to the extent that they have surrendered powers to the Federal Government.&quot; When in the Joint Select Committee, the then Secretary of State was asked what was meant by the phrase &quot; Protection of the rights of any Indian State,&quot; he replied : &quot; There is a point here that does directly concern the Provinces. The kind of case we had in mind was the need for intervention, supposing, within a Province, the movement was growing up such as the kind of movement of which we have had examples, in which large bodies of a particular community or a particular mode of thought, march in from the Province into a neighbouring State and stir up trouble in the State. In cases of that kind we felt there ought to be power to prevent such a movement of that kind, endangering the stability of an Indian State.&quot; It is apprehended that the protection against such contingencies provided in the Government of India Act, 1935, may, in certain circumstances, prove inadequate and unsatisfactory.6. In view of the aforesaid consideration, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that I am unable to accede to the Federation on the terms indicated in the Drafts enclosed with your Excellency&apos;s letter under reply. In coming to this decision, I assure your Excellency that I have been moved solely by the dictates of the sacred duty I owe to my State, my Dynasty and my people and of my solemn obligations to the Crown. In conclusion, I find it difficult to believe that it could be the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to close the door on an All-India Federation.I AM writing in reply to your Excellency&apos;s letter of the 27th January, 1939, in which have been indicated the terms which His Majesty&apos;s Government would think it necessary that an Instrument of Accession executed by me should contain in order to fulfil the requirements subject to which it would be submitted for His Majesty&apos;s acceptance. Your Excellency has asked me to inform you whether I would be prepared to execute an Instrument of Accession on behalf of my State within those terms, and has further emphasised that there is no prospect of any substantial variation of the terms indicated, in the direction of allowing a less measure of accession than what is shown therein or of modifying or adding to the limitations specified.2. I have most carefully considered your Excellency&apos;s letter and the accompanying documents. While cordially thanking your Excellency for the regard paid to such insignia of my sovereignty as Posts and Currency, it is with great regret that I have to inform you that I cannot see my way to execute an Instrument of Accession within the terms indicated in your Excellency&apos;s letter.3. I have, throughout the Federal discussions, taken through my advisers an active part in the development of the Federal scheme. As your Excellency is aware, the position has at every stage been most carefully considered by my Government which has endeavoured to keep your Excellency and His Majesty&apos;s Government fully informed as regards my attitude to the scheme as it took shape. Moreover, my Government has sought, both alone and in collaboration with other States, to see how the difficulties which have arisen at various stages could be resolved, and your Excellency will, I think, agree that many of the differences which arose in the past have in fact been overcome as a result of discussions, formal and informal, between my advisers and those of the Govern-ment of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government. At an early stage of the history of the Federal idea, I declared myself in favour of it in a letter addressed to your Excellency&apos;s distinguished predecessor, dated the 1st August, 1931; since then, on various occasions, when the scheme appeared to be in jeopardy, my advisers, both by constructive suggestions for its amendment and by persuading the States to take a larger view, saved it from rejection.   This being so, yourI remainANNEXURE 3.
Excellency will, I feel, desire that I should state somewhat fully the reasons why I cannot regard as acceptable the terms of the Instrument of Accession now put before me. Even should the differences between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and myself prove insuperable, I do not wish it to be thought that I have not given to the present proposals the same consideration that I have given to the federal proposals in the past, or that in declining the present proposals I have gone back upon the attitude which I took in the earlier stages of the federal discussions. The main reasons which have led me to the conclusion that I cannot accept the present proposals and which have throughout weighed with me and been communicated to your Excellency&apos;s Government, are set out below.4. Treaty Rights.- I have, from. the outset, regarded it as fundamental that such Treaty Rights as I possess should continue under federation to have the status and force which they have had in the past, except in any particular case where it is the intention both of the Government of India and of myself that the particular right should be surrendered on entry into the federal scheme. I have wished to know exactly which of my existing Treaty Rights will be given up. I have wished also that effective machinery should be embodied in the Instrument of Accession to ensure that those rights which should be preserved are, in fact, preserved. It is apparent to me, both from the Note on Treaty Rights which your Excellency has been good enough to send me and from the advice of my own legal advisers, that the question is one of great technical complexity. It is, nevertheless, one of fundamental importance to my State. I do not wish here to enter into the technicalities, and it is sufficient for me to say that neither my own legal advisers nor the Informal Committee^of Ministers of the States, both of whom have considered this matter very fully, are satisfied that, under the present proposals, the most important of my Treaty Rights will be unquestionably and fully preserved. It is essential that, as regards any right which is not to be surrendered, the continuance of the right unaltered in status should be beyond doubt. This, I am advised, is not clearly the case. Further, the Note on Treaty Rights sent by your Excellency indicates that, in certain cases the Federal Legisla-ture would have power to extinguish a Treaty Right by Federal law and that it would be for the Governor-General, in the discharge of his special responsibility, to determine whether it was proper in all the circumstances that it should be permitted to do so. The main rights which the State now enjoys are long-established rights; they have been declared inviolate and inviolable. It has never been suggested in the past that any organ of the British Government, even the Imperial Parliament itself, was competent by legislation without my consent to extinguish those rights. If, under Federation, such rights will become liable at any time to be extinguished by Federal legislation, subject only to the safeguard that it will be for the Governor-General to determine whether it is proper in all the circumstances that they should be extinguished, it does appear to me that there is a fundamental change of status different from anything which I had contemplated throughout the federal discussions.5. Defence. I would not wish it to be thought that, in attaching so much importance to the question of Treaty Rights, I am dealing only with small matters or mere personal privileges. Of the Treaty Rights which I have particularly in mind the most important are those which relate to the defence of my State, beginning with the first Treaty of Perpetual Alliance in the year 1766 and continuing with other Treaties both for the general protection of my State and for the provision of specific military guarantees by the furnishing of particular specified troops. My views in regard to these rights were made clear at a very early stage of the federal discussions, as appears from paragraph 114 of the Report of the Indian States Enquiry Committee (Finance), 1932, where the Committee, in considering the valuation of territories ceded by me in return for specific military guarantees, wrote :  &quot; We need not, however, pursue these calculations any further, as we are informed by the representatives of the Nizam that His Exalted Highness&apos;s Government has no wish to accept any financial adjustment in lieu of the ceded territories, and desires the continued maintenance of the subsidiary force and the full performance of the treaty obligations undertaken by the Company&apos;s Government in 1800. The Treaty is only terminable with the consent of both parties, and there is, therefore, no option but to meet the wishes of His Exalted Highness&apos;s Government.&quot;
The same point was made clear in the course of the discussions regarding Berar, with respect to which certain rights were granted in return for certain military guarantees. I then similarly made it clear that I wished the guarantees to remain unimpaired and in Article 15 of the Agreement relating to Berar, made on the 24th October, 1936, between His Majesty the King-Emperor and myself, it is provided that : Nothing in the present Agreement in any way affects or diminishes the military guarantees enjoyed by His Exalted Highness under any existing treaty or agreement, and nothing in the present Agreement shall be construed as imposing any obligation on His Exalted Highness not existing at the date hereof for the maintenance of the force known as the Hyderabad Contingent or its modern equivalent.&quot;This attitude I have never altered, and, in view of the advice which I have received, that the continuance and status of my Treaty Eights in regard to defence are not assured beyond question under the present proposals, I cannot consider such proposals as acceptable.I am advised that there is a further respect in which the present proposals in regard to defence are not clearly satisfactory, in that there is some question how far the obligations of defence will legally remain functions of the Crown Representative (as I should desire) and how far they will become functions of the Federal Government. In this respect, too, I should desire the constitutional position to be placed beyond doubt.6. Administration. The question of the administration of Federal laws in my State has been a matter of concern to me from the beginning of the federal discussions. My views in this regard were set out in the State&apos;s Memo-randum of the 1st November, 1933, submitted to the Joint Select Committee, which reads as follows : &quot; One more general question requires consideration. It would be impossible for the State to accede to the federation unless it was plain beyond doubt from the constitutional documents that the sovereign status of His Exalted Highness the Nizam was fully maintained and preserved. One illustration of this is to be found in the question of administration. Throughout the Round Table Conferences the discussion as to the division of powers between the Federation and the units proceeded upon the basis of a clear-cut distinction between policy and legislation on the one hand, and administration on the other. The first eight subjects in Appendix VI, List 1, of the White Paper were, of course, then treated as outside the federal category, but, leaving those subjects aside for the moment, most of the subjects which now appear in the federal list were described as being federal &apos; for policy and legislation &apos; only, it was on this footing that the State envisaged the question of accepting any given subject as federal. The distinction has been dropped in the White Paper but the State desires to make it plain that it adheres to the substance of the conception and desires that it should, as far as possible, be realised in practice, whatever form the constitutional provisions may take. While the State is prepared to agree that Federal legislation on certain subjects shall have effect in the State, the State could not agree to a provision for the formal cession or transfer of administration to the Federation. Administration falls, broadly, into the following parts : (1) The laying down of detailed regulations for giving effect to a statute and the activities of a central department or office, including the issue of explanatory circulars and other written matter; this may be described as central administration. (2) The actual carrying out on the spot of legisla-tion and regulations by means of officials and otherwise; this may be called local administration. (3) The functions of inspection. Whilst (1) may properly be the function of a central authority the State wishes, generally speaking, to keep (2) completely in its own hands in regard to the subjects which it accepts as Federal. With respect to (3) it would not object to normal routine inspection, by arrangement with the State, on behalf of the Governor-General acting in his discretion.&quot;From this general view the State has never receded and Section 125 of the Act was, as my Government understood, intended to enable such arrangements as I had contemplated to be made.   I think His Majesty&apos;s Government would
not deny that, from 1933 at any rate, my views in this regard have been known to them, nor do I think they would suggest that I or my advisers have ever been informed during the six years since 1933 that such views could probably not be met. The extent of the administration which I should retain under the proposals submitted with your Excellency&apos;s letter would only be such as the Federal Legislature might think proper to delegate to a Province under Section 124 of the Act, which might of course be nothing at all since it is entirely within the discretion of the Federal Legislature how far powers are delegated under that Section. From your Excellency&apos;s letter I can only conclude that an administration agreement on the lines which this State has asked in the past would, in the present opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, make any accession insufficient to entitle this State to join the Federation. If that be the considered view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I need not recall to your Excellency the past history of Section 125 of the Act or endeavour to show, as I believe I can conclusively show, that the State is not now being permitted to use Section 125 for the purpose for which it was originally inserted in the Act and that the agreement now proposed is not really an agreement under that Section. I regard the matter as of vital importance to my Sovereignty. The officials who administer my laws are my servants and carry my authority into the farthest and most inaccessible corners of my territory. To-day, every official moving in my villages owes me his allegiance. If, to-morrow, there are to be in all parts of my State, in addition to my own officers, Federal officers who are not my servants and owe me no allegiance, it is not difficult to see how far my authority and even the good order of my State may be prejudiced. Villagers do not understand abstruse questions of political theory; but, from the actual presence throughout my State of officers who do not acknowledge my authority, they would draw the inevitable conclusion that I am no longer master in my own house. It is with such considerations in mind that the State&apos;s proposals in regard to administration were made from the very outset of the Federal discussions, and I still regard them as so important that I am not now prepared to waive them, even though I may thereby give up the advantages of joining in the Federation of India.I desire also to point out that, while in the former draft Instruments, the opening paragraph of clause 3 contained a sub-paragraph dealing with the limitation on the exercise of the executive authority of the Federation in the State, that sub-paragraph has not been omitted. The reasons for the omission are not understood. The sub-paragraph in question correctly stated the position as hitherto understood between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the States, and was correct, as a matter of form, being based on Section 6 (2) of the Act which expressly states that the Instrument shall contain the limitations to which the executive authority of the Federation is to be subject.7. Railways and Acquisition of Land. This has always been a subject of the greatest importance to my State, in view of the fact that the Hyderabad State Railways are the largest State Railways in India and serve the greater part of the State. The views of the State were presented in a memorandum to the Joint Select Committee and have been in possession of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India at all stages since then. I can, I think, fairly claim that the railway provisions contained in the Act are, to a considerable extent, the fruit of discussions between my advisers and the advisers of His Majesty&apos;s Government. From the beginning, Government has maintained two major points : first, that there should not be power to construct railways in the State without my consent, just as the State Railway has no power to construct lines outside the State without the consent of British India; and, secondly, that the State Railway should not in matters of ordinary administration be under the control of the Federal Railway Authority, the very authority responsible for the profitable running of railways which are in many respects commercial competitors of the State Railways.&apos; These two matters, for which I have asked from the first and which are not conceded, I still regard as essential to the commercial existence of. the State Railways and the proper development of the State. To the extent of the first of the above two points, I would add that the principle was fully recognised in the Resolution of the Political Department No. 202-1 of the 6th December, 1923, and was further embodied in the White Paper of 1933, where the Entry corresponding to Entry 20 read : &quot; Construction of Railways in British India and, with, the consent of the State, in a State.&quot; The
omission in the Joint Select Committee&apos;s Report, and subsequently in the Act, of the phrase &quot;with the consent of the State&quot; was due to the drafting rule adopted by that Committee that variations from the general content of a federal subject should be in the Instrument of Accession and not in the Act. The limitation proposed by me, that my consent should be required to new construction in the State, merely reproduced the words embodied in the White Paper and was never repudiated. The question whether such a limitation would be allowed was expressly raised in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land during the discussions which took place between the advisers of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the India Office and my advisers in 1935, and the reply was satisfactory to the State. On the question of strategic railways, if such fresh lines should ever further be required, my Government has already offered to make special provision, yet the limitation proposed has not been accepted, while, under acquisition of land, clause 7 of the draft Instrument now proposes to place on me an obligation to acquire land on behalf of the Federation. No such obligation has been suggested at any previous stages, and the corresponding obligation imposed by the Act on Provinces is framed, presumably intentionally, so as not to apply to States. These considerations induce me to regard the position resulting from unqualified accession to Entry 20 as unsatisfactory on the whole, despite the provision of the proposed Railway Tribunal.- As regards the draft agreement for retrocession of Railway lands, there are points on which I should anticipate that modification could be agreed to after a full discussion, for which there has not yet been any opportunity. Since, however, I am not able to accept the terms proposed for&apos;accession, it seems hardly worth while entering into the details of that agreement in this letter.8. Development of Industries. /Entry 34 of the Federal Legislative List, dealing with this subject, is one on which I feel much apprehension, because the terms used are so wide that it is impossible to know what laws might not some day be passed under the Entry. They might, for example, even extend to nationalisation. If the limitation suggested by His Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to particular named industries were extended so as to be applicable to all industries, I should be inclined to give preference to that position, even though the powers exercisable would still be wide, but on a matter so important to my State I do not feel able to accept the very indefinite powers which accession without a limitation applicable to all industries might some day involve. This wide definition of the Entry was pointed out at a discussion in the India Office by my advisers, and they were given to understand that the real purpose of the Entry was to enable the Federation to provide for subsidies, cesses and national institutions for furthering the development of industries, and not to give the Federation far-reaching powers of interference with private enterprise. The limitations proposed by my Government in this regard were based upon what was thought to be the underlying intention of the Entry.9. Import and Export. ?The position which has for many years obtained between my State and British India is governed by the commercial treaty of 1802, under which the land customs duties which I may charge are restricted to a 5 per cent, ad valorem duty, and there are corresponding restrictions upon the Government of India and other provisions relating to freedom of trade generally. I had understood that this position was- to continue under Federation. I am advised that as regards my own right to charge duties, the limitations proposed to Entries 19 and 44 (although not quite in the form which my advisers would have preferred) do substantially maintain the existing position. As regards, however, the obligations of the British Government, I am advised that, for the reasons given above under the head of Treaty Rights,; it is uncertain how far they are preserved. This is an important example of a treaty right which I would wish to see clearly secured. In the meantime, my Government&apos;s request, which I consider to be eminently fair, to have the Commercial Treaty interpreted by an independent judicial tribunal, has. been rejected. Further, I have now been informed of certain far-reaching amendments to the Government of India Act, regarding which the State was not consulted, which make the position with respect to my State&apos;s rights under the Commercial Treaty still more uncertain.&quot;10. Arms and Ammunition.--UnA.ev Entry 29 two limitations proposed, by the State for the purpose of enabling it to maintain law and order are omitted. One was directed to preserving the State&apos;s power to restrict, the carriage of arms,
the other to securing that the position with regard to the use of arms by my military and police forces should remain as at present and should not come under Federal control. A similar point arises under Entry 30 in regard to the use of explosives by the State forces. These points are in accordance with the Federal scheme as originally contemplated in the White Paper; and I find it hard to see in what way such limitations would effectively impair the reality of my accession to Federation.11. Before concluding, I feel I must refer to a matter which, though outside the scope of your Excellency&apos;s letter, is a fundamental requirement, one, indeed, which is implicit in any scheme of Federation. When Provincial Autonomy was inaugurated, it was hoped that its working would be such as to have due regard to the rights and interests of the States and to assist the growth of a federal spirit. I am reluctantly obliged to say, however, that in some cases this hope has not been entirely fulfilled. Thus, for example, in spite of the illustration given in the answer of the Secretary of State for India to Query No. 5781 in the Joint Select Committee, the precise kind of movement, namely, the incursion of jathas, which it was the intention of section 52 (/) of the Act to prevent, is now taking place against my own State, and certain Provinces have been permitted to be used as bases for such operations. Mutual respect for the integrity of units is essential in any scheme which aims at the realisation of all-India unity, and any violation of that principle, especially at a time when the Provinces and the States have before them the prospect of realising unity, only shows the present absence of the federal spirit which must in any event be a necessary condition to the establishment of Federation.12. I have set out above the main reasons why I am unable to accede to Federation on the terms indicated in your Excellency&apos;s letter. Had I felt able to accept the substance of the terms proposed, there are, I am advised, several less important points (including points of drafting, for example, the new definition of an Indian State and date of giving effect to financial limitations) which it would have been necessary to raise. I cannot but think, however, that points of this nature could have been settled by discussion, and that no purpose would in any case be served by entering upon a discussion of them here. May I repeat that it is with deep regret that I have come to the conclusion that I cannot accept the present proposals which (though they embrace in regard, for instance, to the vital question of administration, a scheme which is novel and hitherto undiscussed) I am given to understand I must treat as not open to modification? If, however, in spite of the fact that your Excellency has emphasised that the terms indicated in your letter must be regarded in all essentials as incapable of further relaxation since they represent the furthest point to which His Majesty&apos;s Government have found it possible to go, your Excellency now feels that further consideration and adjustment are called for in these respects before finally determining a problem of such consequence to the unity of India, I can assure your Excellency of my full co-operation in effecting such adjustment.Yours sincerely, (Signed) MIR OSMAN ALI KHAN.To His Excellency the Viceroy.ANNEXURE 4.Note Regarding States&apos; Rights.Some explanation- is necessary of the position in regard to rights at present-enjoyed by Indian States in the field of administration covered by the matters included in the&apos; Federal Legislative List. The word &quot; rights &quot; is here used to cover not only legal rights, but as extending to special administrative arranee-ments now subsisting between States and the Government of India.[19706]       ^ e2
2. The position can be stated simply in the case in which a State does not accede to the Federation at all. And it is the same for a Federated State in regard to matters falling within the Federal Legislative List, which, in acceding to the Federation, it has abstained from specifying as matters on which the Federation may make laws for the State. The position here is that, if action by Federal authorities were held by a State to affect prejudicially any right of the State, it would be for the Crown Representative to determine whether the right claimed ought to be recognised as such, and, if so, for the Governor-General to determine what action he should take in pursuance of his special responsibility under Section 12 (1) (g) of the Act.3. The position is different as regards rights falling within the range of matters accepted by a State as matters, with regard to Avhich the Federal Legislature may make laws for the State. In this case, so far as this can be done within the terms of section 6 of the Act, there is a possibility of protecting a right by a limitation (whether framed with specific reference to the particular &quot; matter &quot; to which the right appertains or with reference to an enumeration in the form of a Schedule to the Instrument of Accession of all rights claimed by a State) so drawn up as to disable the Federal Legislature and/or Executive from taking any action otherwise within its competence under the Act to modify oi extinguish the right. His Majesty&apos;s Government have given the fullest consideration both in their legal aspects and as regards the merits of each particular case to all proposals put forward by States for limitations. They have reached the conclusion that it is not possible to go beyond the proposals in the First Schedule to the draft Instrument of Accession in the direction of enabling States to secure protection of their rights through limitations under section 6 (2).4. At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not themselves take the view that the accession of a State to Federation automatically abrogates rights at present enjoyed by the State in the federal field in matters with respect to which it is agreed that the Federal Legislature may in future make laws for the State. As regards the protection thereafter of such rights the States, apart from having through their representatives in the Federal Legislature a valuable means of resisting encroachments, must rely upon the existence of the special responsibility imposed upon the Governor-General by the Act for &quot; the protection of the rights of any Indian State and the rights and dignity of the Ruler thereof,&quot; and upon the powers derived therefrom. Such indication as is possible in concrete terms of the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate as being the guide of the Governor-General in the discharge of this special responsibility is contained in paragraph XV of the draft Instrument of Instructions to the Governor-General which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose in due course to submit for approval of Parliament. . Along with this draft para-graph XV should be read the proposed paragraphs III, IV and V of the Instrument of Instructions to be issued to the Crown Representative.5. It will be open to a Federated State (unless the State preferred to agree to the contrary as indicated below), in the event of a dispute arising with the Federation which involves any question as to the existence or extent of a legal right&apos;&apos; relating to a matter for which the State has federated, to approach the Federal Court under the provisions of Section 204 of the Act for a ruling as to the existence or extent of the right claimed. But a finding by the Federal Court in favour of the State&apos;s contention would not affect the power of the Federal Legislature to modify or extinguish the right in question by a federal law, a power which it would have in regard to any right falling within its legislative sphere, whether or not the subject-matter of the right had been accepted by the State as federal. In the event of the Federation proposing to exercise such power, it would be for the Governor-General in the discharge of his special responsibility to determine whether it was proper in all the circumstances that it should be permitted to do so. In this respect a finding by the Court would, of course, differ from a finding that an act of the Federation, whether executive or legislative, was beyond its competence as contravening the provisions of the Constitution Act or of a State&apos;s Instrument of Accession, since a finding of the latter description would conclusively bind the Federation. Some States have expressed the desire to exclude from the jurisdiction of the Federal Court the determination of their
rights or certain of them. His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to authorise an agreement between any State and the Crown in the following terms : &apos;&apos; In all Agreements, Treaties, Engagements and Sanads formerly entered into between the British authorities and this State or undertaken towards or granted to this State by the British authorities [&quot;other than those specified in the attached Schedule] the following clause shall be added :&apos; The jurisdiction of the Federal Court shall not extend to any agreement&apos; &quot; . Treaty.&apos; &quot;dispute arising under this Engagement.&apos;Sanad.&apos; &quot;      .In the schedule would be named only those documents in respect of which the State desired to accept the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, so far as the Federal Court found that it had jurisdiction under the latter part of proviso (a) (ii) to sub-Section 204 (1). The words in square brackets would be omitted from the agreement if the State did not desire to accept the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in respect of any of its agreements, &amp;c. It must be emphasised that it is entirely at the option of any State to enter into this agreement.ANNEXURE 5,Draft Instrument of Instructions to the Governor-General.INSTRUCTIONS are expected to be as presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for India in February 1935 with the following changes :-Substitute the following for paragraph XV.-&quot; XV. In the discharge of his special responsibility for the protection of the rights of any Indian State and of the rights and dignity of the Ruler thereof, Our Governor-General shall, in relation to any right recognised as such by Our Representative for the exercise of the functions of the Crown in its relations with Indian States, have due regard to the principles and policy which have in the past guided Us and Our Predecessors as Paramount Power. He shall in particular construe that responsibility as requiring him to see that no action is taken which would prejudice the discharge of the obligations of the Crown, whether general or specific, to protect a Ruler or his State, or would imperil or tend to imperil the economic life of a State or would discriminate unjustly against it or would invade in a State without due compensation any right of property of a State.&quot;Additional paragraph. -&quot;Our Governor-General shall withhold his assent from any Bill providing for the punishment of persons who refuse to give evidence or produce documents before Committees of the Federal Legislature, unless it contains a provision that the other provisions thereof shall have effect subject to such rules for regulating the attendance before such Committees of persons who are, or have been, in the service of a Federated State and safeguarding confidential matter from disclosure, as may be made by the Governor-General, exercising his individual judgment.&quot;A further paragraph will be required to cover cases where States which were exercising the right to levy land customs duties &quot;on the 31st March, i937, may be allowed to preserve this right by limitation, since the limitation empowers the Governor-General in his discretion to approve variations in the rates of duties levied on the 31st March, 1937, and an instruction is required in respect of the exercise of this discretion. The text will be communicated later,* but it will be to the effect that the Governor-General should see that no serious fresh obstacle to trade is created and that the net aggregate proceeds of a State&apos;s land customs duties resulting from a tariff approved by him do not materially exceed those received by the State in respect of the year 1936-37.* See Annexure 8.
Note Regarding the Administration of Federal Laws inFederated States.THE States have shown anxiety to take advantage of the provisions of Section 125 of the Act in order to secure with greater certainty than would result from reliance upon the provisions of Section 124 the entrustment to their Governments or officers of such powers and duties under Federal laws as can properly be made over to them. The draft Instrument of Accession (para-graph 4A and the Third Schedule) incorporates provisions to this end, which are based on the principle of parity of treatment between States and Provinces. It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that every State named in Divisions I to XVI of the Table of Seats attached to the First Schedule to the Act shall have the option of adopting these provisions, and these States are requested to indicate whether they wish paragraph 4A (with the Third Schedule) to be included in their Instrument of Accession, and, if so, which of the three Provinces mentioned in the first clause of the Third Schedule they prefer as their model.ANNEXURE 7.Draft of the &apos; Government of India (States&apos; Contributions in Lieu of Federal Surcharge) Order, 19   .At the Court at Buckingham Palace, the...................day of..................193 .Present.&quot;WHEREAS it is provided by sub-section (3) of Section one hundred and thirty-eight of the Government of India Act, 1935 (hereafter in this Order referred to as &quot;the Act&quot;), that any Act of the Federal Legislature imposing a surcharge for Federal purposes on any tax on income shall provide for the payment by each Federated State in which taxes on income are not leviable by the Federation of a contribution to the revenues of the Federation assessed on a basis to be prescribed by His Majesty in Council;And whereas a draft of this Order was laid before Parliament in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section three hundred and nine of the Act, and an address has been presented to His Majesty by both Houses of Parliament praying that an Order may be made in the terms of this Order.Now, therefore, His Majesty, in the exercise of the powers conferred on him by the provisions aforesaid and of all other powers enabling him in that behalf, is pleased by and with the advice of His Privy Council to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows : 1. This Order may be cited as the Government of India (States&apos; Contri-butions in lieu of Federal Surcharge) Order, 193 .2. The Interpretation Act, 1889, applies for the interpretation of this Order as it applies for the interpretation of an Act of Parliament.3. In this Order &apos;&apos; urban population &apos;&apos; means the number of persons living in towns with not less than ten thousand inhabitants, and &quot; estimated &quot; means estimated by the Governor-General.4. The amount of any contribution required in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section one hundred and thirty-eight of the Act to be paid by a Federated State shall be computed by applying to the net proceeds of the surcharge in British India (excluding the Provinces of Bombay and Bengal), a fraction the numerator of which is the estimated urban population of the State and the denominator of which is the estimated urban population of British India (excluding the said Provinces).&quot;Net proceeds&quot; in this paragraph has the same meaning as in Section 144(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and shall in a like manner be ascertained and certified by the Auditor-General of India, whose certificate shall be final.ANNEXURE 6.
5. The amount of any such contribution as is mentioned in the last preceding paragraph which is to be paid by a Federated State of which the urban population is estimated to be nil, shall be computed : (a) by selecting from among the Federated States which have an urbanpopulation the State the estimated urban population of which bears the lowest proportion to its estimated population; and(b) by applying to the contribution payable by that State a fraction thedenominator of which is the estimated total population thereof and the numerator of which is the estimated total population of the State for which the contribution is to be computed under this paragraph.ANNEXURE 8.Draft Paragraph regarding Customs for the Governor-Qeneral&apos;s Instru-ment of Instructions : as communicated to the States on June 6, 1939.&quot; IN the discharge of his duty to act in his discretion or to exercise his individual judgment in respect of proposals relating to the import or export of goods across the boundary between two units of the Federation, Our Governor-General shall have regard to the injurious effects of impediments to the free move-ment of commodities throughout the Federation; and, subject always to his obli-gations under the last preceding paragraph, he shall give his sanction to the exercise by the Federation of its powers to prohibit, restrict or place duties upon the import or export of goods across the boundary between two units, only in cases in which he is satisfied that the exercise of this power is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding international obligations, or counteracting conditions tending to unfair competition between units, or ensuring that the Federation obtains any sums which, regard being had to any existing rights of any Federated State in regard to the levy and retention of duties of customs, are due to it in respect of the import or export of goods into or from India, or maintaining public security, health or morality.And whereas certain Federated States may by virtue of specific provisions in the Instruments of Accession of their Rulers levy duties of customs upon articles imported and exported across their own boundaries, and may also, with the approval of Our Governor-General in his discretion, from time to time alter the rates of such duties or the articles upon which duties are leviable:Now, therefore, Our Governor-General, in pursuance of the considerations set forth in this paragraph, shall not give his approval to any such alteration by a State unless he is satisfied both that no serious fresh barrier to the flow of trade within the Federation would be thereby created and that the net aggregate proceeds of the duties as so altered would not materially exceed the net aggregate proceeds of the duties which accrued to the State in respect of the year 1936-37.&quot;-
