SITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S^GQVERM1ENT.it aSEC RET. COPY NO.CP. 158 (39).CABINET.ROAD ACCIDENTS - REGULATION OF CYCLISTS, Memorandum by the Minister of Transport!In 1936 the then Minister of Transport drew the attention of the Transport Advisory Council to the increase in the number of pedal cycles in use on the roads and to the large number of accidents&apos; in which pedal cyclists are involved, and invited them to consider and report upon any further practicable measures which, in the Council&apos;s opinion, might be adopted for the better protection of cyclists and other road users.2.      The Council reported in Jurte, 1938, but in the meantime the Select Committee of the House of Lords on the Prevention of Road Accidents had been set up and as this Committee proposed to survey the whole field of road safety, it was not thought desirable to take any action on the Transport Advisory Council&apos;s Report until the Report of the Select Committee had also been received.     My predecessor answered a Parliamentary Question on 27th July, 193855, to this effect.3.      The Select Committee reported at the end of March and made a large number of recommendations affecting cyclists. They state in their Report that there is much thoughtless conduct among cyclists, which is responsible for many accidents. This view is confirmed by&apos;the detailed survey undertaken by my Department of the causes of all road accidents involving personal injury which occurred during the year ending March, 1937.x   Official Report, 27th July, 1938 - Column 3112.
In that year there were 6,337 fatal accidents and 192,725 further accidents causing injury, and of these 1,051 (16.6%) and 44,317  (23o0%)  respectively were attributed to pedal cyclists 5    the number of pedal cyclists killed during that year was 1,440 and the number of those injured 70,182.4.     Pedal cyclists are at present comparatively free from statutory control.      They must of course comply with traffic directions and with certain requirements as to lighting, but apart from certain minor offences such as holding on to a motor vehicle for the purpose of being drawn and carrying an additional rider in a case where the cycle is not adapted for the carriage of more than one person, the only traffic offence which a pedal cyclist can commit is that of riding &quot;so as to endanger life and limb&quot;.5.      I am being strongly pressed to announce the decision of the Government in regard to the Alness Report,,which has now been in the hands of the public for nearly four months.It is quite impossible to deal with over two hundred recommendations in any speech of tolerable length, and I have announced that I will issue in the form of a White Paper a commentary on the whole Report.      In this document I propose to give reasons for the rejection of many of the Select Committee&apos;s proposals, and a statement of the measures to be taken to implement those we decide to accept.     Many of the recommendations relating to pedal cycles are extremely controversial and before announcing our policy on them, I should like to have the concurrence of my colleages.      There are said to be some 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 pedal cyclists and (although these figures may be over-estimates) any action affecting cyclists as a body would clearly concern a very large section of the community and might have considerable political repercussions.
6.     The following are the more important recommendations    1 of the Select Committee concerning cyclists s-(a) pedal cycles should he registered and should carrynumber plates *(b) Cyclists should be compulsorily insured against thirdX^arty risks.(c) Cyclists should be compelled to report all accidentsin which they are involved.(d) Red rear lamps should be compulsory on all cycles.(e) Bells should be compulsory on all cycles.(f) It should be an offence for a cyclist to carryanything on his cycle which interferes with his control or with his view of the road.(g) Cyclists should not be allowed to ride more than twoabreast except when overtaking.(h) The Minister of Transport should, make it compulsoryfor every cycle to have two efficient brakeso(i) Cycles should conform to a standard of fitness?    anda use and construction order for cycles should bemade by the Minister    of Transport, (j)    The use of cycle tracks by pedal cyclists wheresatisfactory should be made compulsory, (k)    Children under 10 years of age should not be allowedto cycle on public roads. In the succeeding paragraphs I comment on theseproposals.(a) Registration and Number, Plates. 7.      Generally speaking the police desire that pedal cyclists&apos; should be required to register their vehicles and equip them with identification plates in the same way as motor vehicles must be registered and carry such plates.     The object of this control for motor vehicles is, of course, to enable them to be identified and the responsibility for any offence brought home to the right person when this might otherwise be a matter of difficulty owing to the speed which
such vehicles can attain.      Apart from assisting the recovery of stolen vehicles,  it does not seem that the same advantages would a rise from requiring pedal cycles to he registered and carry identification plates0      Cycles cannot attain any great speed and in the case of an accident the cyclist is likely to he thrown and readily detained or apprehended,  although there may, of course, he isolated cases when the cyclist is the indirect cause of an accident and gets away unidentified., Registration is required in certain continental countries chiefly,  apparentljr, as a method of taxation.      It has been considered from that point of view here, but investigation has shown that the registration and licensing of cycles would be likely to prove a most uneconomic as well as unpopular method of obtaining revenue.      Registration was carefully considered by the Transport Advisory Council, who came to the conclusion that no valid reason was put before them for the registration of cycles if taxation was not contemplated.    . I rejgommend^thatwe., should f oilow the Transpprt^Advi^pJiy......Council......in^ this matterand, reject, the recommendation of the. Select^ Committee.80      The Select Committee,  in their Report,  express the hope that a system of registration will impart a sense of greater responsibility to cyclists generally.      The Transport Advisory Council,  after rejecting the proposal for registration, recommended that cyclists should be required to carry their names and addresses in some semi-per-manent form attached to their vehicles by way of an identification disc.      The Council add that cyclists&apos;  organisations would not be likely to object to this proposal and that its adoption would increase the sense of responsibility of cyclists and might have beneficial effects upon their characters as road users.      I would, propose to accept this recommendation of the.^Tran^sj^proposal^J^AYJjLoyX-^^l^J^&apos;(D) Compulsory Insurance. 9.      The Select Committee do not consider that their recommend!-tion for the compulsory insurance of pedal cyclists
against third party risks should he,adopted unless the^r recommendation with regard to registration is also adopted. The matter was considered by the Transport Advisory Council who came to the conclusion that compulsory third party insurance for cyclists was not a practicable proposition.     My own enquiries confirm this view,  and in the circumstances I do not propose to accept the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation, -particular!?/ as they have themselves made it dependent upon the adoption of their proposals for registration.(c) Reporting of Accidents.10.      The Committee&apos;s recommendation that cyclists should be compelled, as are motorists, to report all accidents in which they are involved, coincides with the recommendation of the Transport Advisory Council.      I-would propose to accept the recommendation of the Select Committee and the Council on this point and to provide,  in the Road Traffic Bill which will be required to implement various recommendations of the Select Committee, for the extension of Section 22 of the Road Traffic Act,  1930 (which relates to the reporting of accidents by drivers of motor vehicles involved in certain categories of accidents)  so as to place similar obligations upon cyclists.(d) Red Rear Lights.11.      The Select Committee recommend that pedal cycles should carry a red rear light in addition to the red reflector and white surface which nre already compulsory.This is the most controversial of all the proposals of the Select Committee and the arguments for and against acceptance are closely balanced.      The Transport Advisory Council also recommended that cyclists should be required to carry a red rear lamp.      They stated, however,  that this matter was one which had caused them the most difficulty and the recommendation was dissented from by 11 out of 30 Members of the Council.      On the Sub-Committee, which considered the
subject of accidents to cyclists and reported to the Council, there was a majority opposed to the requirement.     The two Inter-Departmental Committees on Road Safety Amongst School-Children in England and Scotland, respectively, which reported in 1935 and 1936, favoured the red rear light,12.     Those who advocate the compulsory red rear light argue that the object of-such a light is to indicate the position at night of a vehicle which is being overtaken and it is,  therefore, most necessary on a pedal cycle, which is   more frequently overtaken than any other vehicle.     Cyclists were required to carry red rear lights during the War and if such a requirement was made then there is, they suggest, no reason why it should not be made now.s    They point out that a reflector is not a satisfactory substitute as it is dependent upon reflection from headlights and its value is considerably reduced when headlights are dipped.      (For the purpose of mitigating dazzle, regulations now require motor vehicles to be fitted with headlights which are capable of being dipped, and in paragraph 47 of the Highway Code we instruct motorists to dip their headlights when meeting other vehicles on the road unless there are special circumstances which make it unsafe for them to do so).      The supporters of the red rear lamp also argue that its use would considerably reduce the strain on motorists when driving at night, with,  as pointed out by the Select Committee, a consequent reduction of the risks that accompany such strain.13.      Those who are against the red rear lamp point out that a motorist should always be able to pull up within the distance covered by his headlights if he is driving at a safe speed.      Further,  they state that the provision of red rear lamps would encourage motorists to increase their speeds; this,  of course, would mean that a cyclist whose light had gone out without his knowledge would be in greater danger than
before*They emphasise the difficulty of providing a satisfactory lamp which is free from the danger of being put out as a result of the jarring of the cycle;      they also state that the cost of providing a red rear lamp might bear heavily on the poorer classes of cyclists,      I am advised, however, that red rear lamps, operated by a dry battery, are obtainable to-day from a shilling upwards, and that these lamps,  although not the most reliable that can be devised,  are probably a great deal more reliable than the oil lamp which was used during the War.      The modern small electric bulb is generally of robust construction and in the dry-battery bulb there are the minimum of connections to go-wrong.     The illumination of such lamps may not be very high, but at any rate they would be more effective than any red reflector could be.      Cost of operation must be taken into account.     With special low consumption biiibs a standard single cell battery costing 5-gd. will give 60 hours1  continuous light.     -Efficient dynamo sets, incorporating head and rear lamps, with a battery for operating the front lamp when the bicycle is stationary, may be procured for 13s. 6d.14.      I feel that one of the most effective of the arguments of the opponents of the compulsory light is that if a cyclist is run down from behind or is otherwise involved in an accident, his light would probably be extinguished, and that this would be used as evidence in support of an assertion that,  in fact, no light had been exhibited.      I think this is   an objection which would have to be met and if we decide in favour of legislation to make the rear light compu.lsory,  I propose to -provide that the extinction of the rear light should not be pleaded as an excuse or treated as contributory ner;lip:ence if a cyclist is run down.15.      While the arguments in favour of the red rear lamp seem on the whole to be fairly strong,  it has to be admitted that our statistics do not show that the absence of the light is a major cause of accidents.      During the year ended Inarch 1937
448 cyclists were killed during the hours of darkness, and of these 133 were killed through vehicles colliding with the rear of their cycles.      The total number of cyclists killed during the same period was 1,440.16,     The balance of opinion seems to be- in favour of the red rear lamp.      It is true that the cyclists&apos;  organisations are bitterly opposed to any such   requirement, but it must be remembered that the combined membership of the Cyclists&apos; Touring Club and the National Cyclists&apos;  Union probably does not exceed 100,000,.although,  as mentioned earlier, there may be between 8,000,000 and 10,000,000 cyclists.      No doubt a large proportion of the unorganised cyclists hold the same views as those who are organised, but an investigation made by an organisation known as &quot;The British Institute of Public Opinion&quot; showed that eight out of ten of the persons of voting age interviewed, favoured rear red lamps for cyclists.     A very large number of cyclists are, however, less than 21 years old.The majority of motorists would, of course, welcome a requirement that cyclists should carry rear red lights.17,     Taking everything together, I feel that it would be difficult for me to reject the advice of the Alness Committee on this subject,  reinforced as it is by the recommendations of the Transport Advisory Council and the two Inter-Departmental Committees referred to above and,  in the circumstances, I propose, subject to my colleagues&apos;  concurrence,   that in the statement on the Alness Report,  I should undertake to include the requirement for cyclists to carry rear red lights in any legislation introduced to give effect to the Committees&apos; recommendations.
(e) Bjojtls^18.        At present motor vehicles are required to he fitted with means of giving audible warning of their approach, althoughit is illegal to make use of these warning instruments betweenthe hours of 11-30 p.m, and 7-0 a.m.      This prohibition was imposed by the Secretary of State for war when he was Ministerof Transport, as part of a campaign which was then adopted for greater silence on the roads, including moderation in the useof the motor horn.      At the same time he decided not to proceedwith regulations requiring cyclists to carry bells.      TheTransport Advisory Council in considering whether cyclists shouldbe required to carry bells also reported against such arequirernent.      I feel however that this is a recommendation ofthe Alness Committee which we should accept and I do not believe it will arouse substantial opposition.(^) Articles Carried on Pedal Cycles.19.      The Committee&apos;s recommendation that it should be an offence for a cyclist to carry anything on his cycle which interferes with his control of the machine or with his view of the road, coincides with that made bj? the Transport Advisory Council.      Such a requirement will-be difficult to enforce, but I am satisfied as to its desirabilitjr in princiTJle and I propose to note the point for inclusion in the next Road Traffic Bill. (g) Cycling more than two abreast.20.      The Committee&apos;s recommendations on this point coincide with those of the Transport Advisory Council.     Both the Committee and the Council, however, recognise that any rule forbidding cyclists to ride more than two abreast would be difficult to enforce in certain circumstances, e. g., when employees are arriving at or leaving factories in large numbers.      In Northern Ireland it is an offence &quot;without reasonable cause or excuse&quot; to ride a pedal cycle in such a manner as to cause more than two pedal cyclists to be riding abreast and it appears
from the enquiries made at the Ministry of Home Affairs that the Government of Northern Ireland regard the regulation as having been useful.     Nearly 4,000 convictions for offences against this regulation were obtained during the period April, 1933, to July, 1938.21.      I., am, npt satisfied that any such regulation, however, would be really effective in this country and I am inclined to think that it would be best to continue to rely upon the injunction contained in Paragraph 66 of the Highway Code, which says &quot;ride in single file when the road or traffic conditions require it, and never more than two abreast.&quot;(h) Brakes.22.      I already have power under the Road Traffic Act of 1934, to make regulations as to the number and nature of brakes in use on cycles.      Regulations have not previously been made on the ground that manufacturers usually provide effecient brakes and that the enforcement of any such requirements among cyclists would throw&apos;a heavy burden on the police.      The requirement that the provision of two efficient brakes should be compulsory appears, however, to have been supported in evidence by police witnesses and in view of this fact and the fact that the recommendation was supported also by the Transport Advisory Counci1, I propose to use my existing powers to make regulations in this matter.(i) Standard of Fitness of Cycles.23.      I do not think it necessary to lay down any elaborateregulations for the construction of pedal cycles and their maintenance and I would not propose to accept the Committee&apos;recommendation on this point.(j) Compulsory Use of Cycle Tracks.24.      The Committee&apos;s recommendation that failure to usecycle tracks, where they are satisfactory,  should be an offence,coincides with the recommendation of the Transport AdvisoryftCouncil.      The main objection to making the use of cycle tracks
compulsory hitherto, has been the very short mileage in existence and. the fact that the tracks have been largely experimental in character.      At present there arc not more than forty to fifty miles of cycle tracks altogether.      I do not think, however, that there would be any great harm in making the use of the present tracks compulsory, and it might satisfy a body of opinion that is irritated by the fact that even where cycle tracks are provided for cj^clists they are not always used.(k)     Children under 10 yearajaf age not to be allowed to cycle on public roads.25.      The question of prohibiting young children from cycling on the public roads was considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee (England and Wales) on Soad Safety amongst School Children.      Their view was that &quot;any legislation to this effect would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to enforce and would only serve to bring any such statutory provisions into contempt.&quot;      In addition they took the view that to prohibit children of this age from cycling would prevent them from gaining road sense at a time when they are highly capable of so doing.      The corresponding Committee for Scotland also came to the conclusion that they would not be justified in recommending a minimum age for cyclists.I think that cycling on roads by young children is largely a matter for parental control, and I do not propose to accejjt the recommendation of the Select Committee.Careless Riding.26.      A charge of &quot;careless riding&quot;, as distinct from &quot;riding so as to endanger life and limb&quot; cannot at present be brought against a cyclist.      The Select Committee make no recommendation on this score, but the point is one which had previously been noted by my predecessors for legislation at a convenient opportunity, and the Transport Advisory Council endorsed the view that such an offence should be created.
- is -I would propose , therefore, to include in my statement an announcement that a provision making; the careless riding of a bicycle an offence will be ihcorpdrated in the next Road Traffic Bill.Conclusion.27.      I desire,  subject to the views of my colleagues, toinclude in my statement&apos; on the Select Committee&apos;s Report anannouncement that after consideration of the Report of theTransport Advisory Council and of the Select Committee Ipropose to make regulations as to bells and the number and natureof brakes on pedal cycles and to introduce legislation as soonas possible dealing with, the following matters:-1. Carriage by pedal cyclists of a form of identification disc.2. Introduction of a requirement that pedal cyclists must report accidents (on the lines of section 22 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930).3. Carriage of red rear lamps on pedal cycles.4. Prohibition of carrying articles which interfere with the control of the cycle or the view of the road.5.  Compulsory use of oyclo tracks where they are satisfactory.6. Creation of the offence of careless riding.(Init.)     E. W.Ministry of Transport,18th July, 1959.
