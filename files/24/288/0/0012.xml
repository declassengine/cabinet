Paper No. 1865-B.)Report by the Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War.I. Introduction.1.   WE have been asked by the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade &apos;&apos; To consider whether effective measures of an economic character could be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government, either independently or in association with other Empire and/or foreign Governments, with a view to restraining Japan from further action inimical to British interests in the Far East; if so, what measures and what would be the risks attendant upon them; and to make any recommendations upon the matter as a whole which they may think fit.&quot;2. This Committee was called upon to consider a somewhat similar problem in October 1937,* namely, &quot; what results could be achieved by the imposition of economic sanctions against Japan by the British Empire and the United States of America in conjunction alternatively with or without the co-operation of other countries.&quot; Whereas, therefore, the problem previously considered was how far Japan&apos;s action against China could be arrested by economic pressure, the new problem which the Committee has now considered is more limited and specific in scope, namely, what economic pressure could be enforced against Japan as a deterrent to induce her to cease from measures such as those recently taken antagonistic to British interests.3. In November 1937 the following were our most important conclusions :   (i) An embargo by the British Empire and the United States of America on selected commodities required by Japan would cause her serious difficulty, but in the absence of a world-wide scheme of international rationing, which we regard as quite impracticable, she could not, without a state of war between her and the participating countries, be prevented from acquiring supplies from alternative sources in non-participating countries or by entrepot trade through such countries,* Paper No. A.T.B. 155.   Also C.I.D. Paper No. 1365-B. [19629] b
(n) An embargo by the British Empire and the United States of America on all Japanese export trade would be highly embarrassing for her, and might ultimately prove decisive owing to her inability to pay for imports. Having regard, however, to Japan&apos;s gold reserve and other resources, no decisive effect could be expected for a considerable period, which may be put at between one and two years, (iii) A refusal by the British Empire and the United States of America of bunker facilities and of the use of their ports to Japanese shipping-would increase the economic pressure on Japan, although it would not prevent the conveyance of goods to and from Japan. Such action, which was not taken against Italy, would entail special risks.II. The Legal .Position.4. In 1937, when the problem was the application of sanctions under the Covenant of the League of Nations, the provisions of the Covenant and the Treaty of Peace Act gave the necessary legal basis, in respect of international and municipal law respectively, for taking action. These provisions are not relevant to the present case. Most of the measures of economic pressure referred to in this Report would require some form of legislation, since, in the absence of discrimination against our goods in Japan, we have no existing powers to discriminate against hers.5. Most measures would also conflict with our obligations under the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911. A justification in international law, however, for disregarding our obligations under that Treaty can be found in the doctrine that we are entitled to take reprisals to deter Japan from continuing and increasing the damage which she has done to our interests in China; the rule being in inter-national law that, diplomatic methods having failed, treaties may be disregarded in the exercise of reprisals subject to the proviso that reprisals must be broadly commensurate in the damage they inflict with that caused by the illegalities which justify them. In these circumstances there is no legal necessity for denouncing the Commercial Treaty; denunciation could, in any case, only take effect after the lapse of a year.III. Extent of Japanese Self-Sufficiency.6. In 1937 it was estimated that Japan had at the start of the hostilities in China sufficient quantities of certain essential raw materials,* of which the supply from Japanese sources is inadequate for her requirements, to meet all demands for between six and nine months at the peace-time rate of expendi-ture. On the manufacturing side it was considered that Japan could herself fabricate an adequate quantity of war stores with three possible exceptions  explosives, mechanised transport and aviation spirit.7. Since&apos; October 1937 Japan has ceased to publish the relevant particulars in her trade returns and it is not possible to bring this information up to date. It is known, however, that there is no shortage of food-stuffs, nor is there likely to be in the absence of two successive years of exceedingly bad crops. But both the 1937 and 1938 crops were well above the average of the five years 1933-37. As regards stocks of imported strategic raw materials,* it is probable that these have for the most part been converted into war stores which have largely passed into consumption. There are grounds for thinking that stocks of such materials are now not large (petroleum and nickel excepted, however), and that, in the case of iron, rubber and wool, they are decidedly low.8. On the other hand, the dwindling resistance of the Chinese has decreased Japanese expenditure of munitions, though this consideration does not apply to war stores (such as motor transport and equipment) whose consumption is dependent upon the size and activity of the Japanese armies in the Field. In their case stocks are probably not at all large.* Iron fore, scrap and pig), non-ferrous metals, petroleum, rubber, cotton, wool, wood pulp and jute.
IV. Methods of Economic Pressure.  9. There is no change in the basic methods by which economic pressure can be brought to bear on Japan, Japanese dependencies, and occupied Territories.   As in 1937 this can be considered under the following headings :--Interference with her (A) Imports.(B) Exports.(C) Finance.(D) Shipping.V. Action in Regard to Japanese Imports.Statistical position.10. In our 1937 review we were able to show that Japan was particularly dependent upon the Empire and the United States of America for certain imports of the first importance in war. The suppression of certain Japanese statistics since 1937 makes it impossible to confirm that this is still the position in regard to particular commodities, but it is unlikely that there has been any vital change in this respect. Detailed figures by value for Japanese trade as a whole are set out in Annex I of this report and can be summarised as follows : Table I.Total Value of Imports into Japan during each of the Years 1936, 1937 and 1938 . from all  &quot;-Foreign&quot;^  Countries and Proportions  Imported from  the Countries of the British Empire and the United States (and Dependencies).	1936.	1937.	1938.Total Japanese Imports 			Million yen     ...       ...       ...       :..	2,524	3,489	2,264Percentage coming from 			United Kingdom	2-9	3-0	2-british India   ...	14-7	12-9	8-0Australia	7-2	4-7	3-7Canada ...	2-9	3-0	4-0Bemaining Dominions	1-8	4-0	0-british Colonies and Mandates, &amp;c...	5-4	5-4	5-7Total, British Empire   ...	34-9	330	250United States of America and Dependencies   ...	350	37-7	42-1It will be observed that the proportion of Japan&apos;s total imports taken from the Empire has fallen from 34-9 per cent, in 1936 to 25 per cent, in 1938, while the share of the United States (including dependencies) has risen from 35 per cent, to 42-1 per cent.Comparison of present position with that of 1937.11. In 1937 we took the view set out in paragraph 3 above that, in the absence of a world-wide scheme of international rationing (regarded as quite impracticable), Japan could not, without a state of war between her and the countries of the British Empire and the United States of America, be prevented from acquiring supplies from alternative sources in non-participating countries or by entrepot trade through such countries. In the present instance the question being one of reprisals and not sanctions under the League, rationing measures on* i.o., excluding Manchukuo, Kwantung Peninsula, Korea, Formosa and Japanese Mandates. .[19629] b 2
a comprehensive international scale are even more out of the question than they were in 1937. If the United States of America refused altogether to collaborate in economic reprisals, interference with Japanese imports by countries of the British Empire would be almost wholly ineffective.Raw materials mainly under British Empire control.12. It has been suggested that, in the case of raw materials of which the greater part of all sources of supply are under the control of the countries of the British Empire, it would be possible to prevent their acquisition by Japan by some procedure falling short of a comprehensive system of international rationing, e.g., by the imposition of export control in the producing countries. We find, however, that there are insuperable difficulties about such an arrangement. In the first place, the number of such raw materials is extremely small. In the case of Japan they appear to be only jute and nickel. In the case of the former, it would probably be possible for Japan to make use of some form of substitute (though no doubt she would experience a certain amount of difficulty before she arrived at some reasonably satisfactory substitute), and in the latter, although the main supply is situated in British Empire territory, the financial control is largely in the hands of United States citizens, and export control, in the absence of U.S.A. collaboration, would no doubt be difficult. But, apart from these considerations, the requirements of Japan are so small compared with world output and world consumption* that it seems to us certain that, if the price offered by Japan was adequate, the needs of that country could and would be found by other countries either by temporary depletion of their stocks or by a very slight restriction in their consumption so as to provide the small surplus needed to meet Japanese requirements. Moreover, a disadvantage of procedure by way of control of exports from British sources of supply as compared with a system of rationing established in agreement with importing countries is that the former system cannot readily make allowance for any increase in needs of other countries arising from the restriction of Japanese competition in the manufacturing field.Raw materials not mainly under British Empire control.13. The considerations set out in the preceding paragraphs referring to raw materials, the main sources of which are in British Empire control, make it still less practicable to impose in the British Empire alone an embargo, which would be effective in its results upon Japanese imports, on such important raw materials as cotton, rubber, iron and non-ferrous metals and wool, which are to be obtained in large quantities from sources outside the British Empire. This can be seen clearly if the position in regard to any commodity is investigated in detail. Thus, by way of examples, Ave set out in Annex II the situation in regard to Japanese imports of iron, manganese and wool.14. Consideration of the situation of Japan in regard to these three commodities, of which it is known that stocks in Japan are relatively low, demonstrates that an embargo placed upon their export from the British Empire to Japan would not result in Japan being unable to secure her requirements through other channels. In the first place, her requirements in relation to world production are small. Thus she needs to import about 4 million tons iron equivalent compared with a world output of steel of 132 million tons. For manganese ore the corresponding figures are some 213,000 tons compared with 5,300,000 tons; for wool rather less than 100,000 tons compared with 1,680,000 tons. In each case there are alternative sources directly and readily available, but even if there were no visible alternative exporting country the Japanese require-ments, being so small in relation to world consumption, could be met, as explained in paragraph 12 above, if Japan offered a price sufficiently attractive to induce countries having supplies to forgo their normal requirements to a very modest extent. It is, however, relevant to point out that the dislocation of the normal channels of Japanese trade to be secured by withholding British Empire supplies would involve her in extra cost.   Not only would she probably have to offer a* The Japanese &quot;yen bloc &quot; countries import under 3 per cent, of the world consumption of jute. In the case of nickel normal consumption is 3 per cent, of world production, but rose to about 5 per cent, in 1938, and is likely to be about 8 per cent, for the first half of 1939.
higher price to secure supplies, but in the case of iron and manganese, for example, the freightage on which is a highly important element in the cost delivered in Japan, the conveyance of supplies from alternative sources would involve considerably longer and more expensive hauls. In her present difficult financial position this would be a source of embarrassment to Japan. In the case of wool, disorganisation would be caused by the fact that machinery designed for use with one type of wool cannot readily be used with other types. To meet difficulties in regard to wool imports it is probable that the use of staple fibre as a substitute which has already been developed for all civilian clothing other than for export, would be extended. Furthermore, there is, of course, a danger that the restriction of British Empire exports would lead to the development of the use of substitutes and/or to a stimulus to production in non-British areas and that trade lost during a period of trade restrictions might not be recovered when the restrictions were removed.General conclusions regarding control of British Empire exports to Japan.15. We conclude that the imposition of restrictions on the export of materials from the British Empire to Japan would not yield effective results and might permanently damage British trade interests. It would lead to difficult administrative problems between the United Kingdom Government and those of the Dominions and India who would in any event be reluctant to embark upon any policy of economic action against Japan, particularly on account of issues which they would regard as concerning the United Kingdom only, and which, moreover, unlike the United Kingdom, would be immediately and adversely affected by such a policy (though to a lesser extent in proportion than at the time of our review in 1937), and, if they were prepared to take action against Japan, would almost certainly demand some form of compensation. If the United States of America collaborated with us, a policy of restrictions on exports to Japan would have considerably more effect. The disorganisation in Japan would be greater and she would be put to larger expense in acquiring supplies from countries not closed to her. Moreover, the restrictions could be extended to petroleum, to which, in spite of the existence of war stocks, Japan would be particularly sensitive. Nevertheless, in the absence of a state of war or of an international system of rationing, which we regard as quite impracticable, Japan could not be prevented from acquiring from countries other than the U.S.A. and those of the British Empire or by entrepot trade through such countries her relatively small requirements of raw materials so long as she was in a position to pay for them.16. In considering whether measures should be taken to restrict imports into Japan, it should be borne in mind that the restriction of Japanese exports, which is dealt with in the following section of the report, is itself a method of limiting imports without laying us open to a charge that we are abusing our power over the world&apos;s supply of raw materials.VI. Action in regard to Japanese Exports.Basis of conclusions reached in 1937.17. In our report of 1937 we made an estimate, admittedly speculative, that the prohibition of imports from Japan into the British Empire and the United States would not have a decisive effect for between one and two years. That calculation assumed a net reduction in Japanese exports not exceeding 1,000 millions of yen, after allowing for various adjustments, including diver-sion to other markets. The Japanese gold reserve was then estimated at a market value of 1,220 millions of yen and the annual gold production of Japan and Korea at 200 million yen, and some portion of Japanese-held foreign securities, which were estimated at a nominal value of  137 millions (2,350 millions of yen), could also be made available.Present position regarding Japanese gold reserves.18. Recorded figures are available of imports of gold from Japan into the United States. These imports began in March 1937 and have totalled (up to April 1939) $475 millions (U.S.). In the same period the gold output of Japan, Korea mv-l Manchukuo has been approximately $150 millions, so that
there would appear to have been a net loss of gold of $325 millions since the beginning of 1937, when the gold reserve of the Bank of Japan was stated at $463 millions. The remainder works out at $138 millions or at existing rates of exchange just over 500 millions of yen. Allowance ought to be made for any gold exports the proceeds of which have not yet been spent and are held in the form of dollars or earmarked gold, and also for gold collected from private hoards, &amp;c, in Japanese territories which is unlikely to exceed 100 million yen.19. As to the Japanese balance of payments, we may assume that the favourable balance on invisible items, which for 1936 was estimated at 224 millions of yen, has fallen, under war conditions, to negligible proportions. On merchandise account there has been an unfavourable balance for the Japanese Empire (including Manchuria and the Kwantung Peninsula) amounting in 1937 to 857 millions of yen and in 1938 to 434 millions.20. There may also be large sums for goods imported on Government account and not included in the trade returns. The gold exports of $475 millions (U.S.) or about 1,650 millions of yen in two years and four, months may well have been only just enough to cover the unfavourable balance. In view of recent efforts to increase gold output, as much as 20 millions of yen may be met from that source. If gold exports continue at the rate of, say, $15 millions (U.S.) or 55 millions of yen a month, the balance of 35 millions would exhaust a gold reserve of 600 millions in about a year and a half. The actual shipments of gold from Japan from the 1st January to the 22nd June this year were no more than 1,757,837 ounces or $61,500,000 (U.S.). That points to a diminished rate of loss, but it is not certain that the statistics over so short a period can be taken as reliable evidence of that conclusion.21. Japan may of course possess other resources such as external invest-nients. A very large proportion of these consists of enterprises in Manchukuo and China which are not realisable. It seems unlikely that if any considerable amount of other external resources were available, such heavy drafts would have been made on the Japanese gold reserve or that the imports would have been so ruthlessly cut down as they have.:):Statistics of Japanese exports.22. Particulars regarding export trade from Japan proper to &quot; foreign &quot; countries* for the years 1936-38 are set out in Annex I of this paper. It will be observed that in 1936 the British Empire and the United States of America (and its dependencies) accounted together for some 65 per cent, by value of Japan&apos;s &quot; foreign &quot; exports. By 1938 this figure had fallen to 57-9 per cent, and such figures as are available for the first three months of 1939 suggest that this tendency may be continuing. The scope for the application of an export embargo is, therefore, not quite so extensive as it appeared in 1937.23. For practical and administrative reasons, having regard in particular to the necessity of requiring certificates of origin from alternative sources of supply, it would be desirable to limit any import prohibitions to readily definable and identifiable classes of goods, which come in proportionately large amounts from Japan, and to except, at any rate initially, commodities such as raw silk, which are the necessary raw material of our silk industry.! But so far as the United Kingdom is concerned the imports from Japan are, generally speaking, of a miscellaneous character and it would be far from easy to single out goods for prohibition in order to overcome the administrative difficulties. The Colonial Empire might find it difficult to dispense entirely with Japanese textiles. This would be particularly the case in East Africa, where Japanese textiles have not*&apos; i.e., excluding Manchukuo, Kwantung Peninsula, Korea, Formosa and the Japanese Mandates.-j- If America came in from the start and was prepared herself to place an embargo on raw silk, it might be worth while our conforming since the Japanese exports of raw silk to the United States are very much larger than to the United Kingdom and the damage to Japan from their cessation correspondingly greater, provided, however, that we can arrange to cover our defence requirements (e.g., parachutes).$ Sir George Sansom, Commercial Counsellor to ELM. Embassy at Tokio, states that this is confirmed by the known heavy withdrawals of Japanese overseas investments in the years immediately preceding the hostilities with China.
been restricted by quota as they have in almost all other Colonial Dependencies and supply almost the whole market. In this area, too, there is the further complication that Tanganyika Territory, which as a Mandated Territory would presumably have to be left out of any scheme of reprisals, is in a form of customs union with Kenya and Uganda. In this area at any rate, therefore, it would be necessary to study the situation very carefully before deciding whether, and if so to what extent, Japanese imports could be excluded.24.

Japanese exports susceptible to interference.26. It will be seen from the preceding tables that of particular Japanese exports textile materials and manufactures form by far the largest group, constituting 31-9 per cent, of the total exports from the &quot; yen bloc &quot; in 1938. The British Empire took 25 per cent, and the U.S.A. 31-6 per cent, of these textile exports. A total prohibition of imports of textile materials and manufactures from Japan into the Empire and the U.S.A. would probably, however, be considered inexpedient for reasons such as those to which we have already referred, namely, the dependence of the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom on the supply of Japanese raw silk and the Colonies&apos; need of cheap Japanese piece goods and clothing. It is not of course possible to say without prior consultation with the Dominion Governments and Colonial administrations how much ought to be allowed for these factors, but the total value of Japanese exports of cotton, rayon, silk and woollen tissues and knitted goods in- 1938 to the British Empire amounted to 223 million yen. If the Dominions and India were prepared to collaborate, it may, however, be assumed that at least one-half of this quantity could be excluded from markets in British territories, although a proportion of the goods so excluded would eventually find their way into other markets where they would compete with goods from existing suppliers.27. As regards Japan&apos;s other exports, it is difficult without long and detailed examination of each trade even to estimate what amount could be excluded. The question is complicated by such considerations as (a) whether it would be necessary, and, if so, worth while, to put the other countries supplying similar goods, frequently in greater quantities than Japan, to the inconvenience of furnishing certificates of origin for their goods a system which is also distasteful to the trading community in the United Kingdom; (b) what scope there may be for evasion, e.g., by slight processing in other countries; and (c) whether the Customs can readily distinguish the goods concerned from similar goods. The outstanding items appear to be tinned and bottled goods, which accounted for 43 million yen, and soya beans from Manchuria, which accounted for about 4 - 6 million yen.General conclusions regarding interference with Japanese exports.28. If the restrictions imposed on Japanese exports to the British Empire were substantial it is probable that at the present time she would have difficulty in readily finding alternative markets which would absorb an appreciable propor-tion of the goods kept out of the Empire. In this event we conclude that, even without the collaboration of the U.S.A., a selective embargo on Japanese textile and other important exports to the British Empire would have highly damaging effects on the general economic situation of Japan. It has been pointed out in paragraph 20 above that a gold reserve of the order of 600 million yen is being reduced, possibly at the rate of about 35 million yen per month. If Japan&apos;s export trade could be cut down, as suggested in paragraphs 26 and 27, it would result in a loss of exports to the/value of some 120,000,000 yen per annum, but this figure cannot be regarded as a &quot; net&apos;&apos; loss, since the curtailment of exports would render it unnecessary for Japan to import the raw materials needed for the manufacture of the excluded goods. It has been estimated that the saving of foreign exchange due to a decrease in imports from this cause would be of the order of one-third of the foreign exchange that would have been obtained from the export of manufactured goods, so that the figure of 120,000,000 yen must be reduced to a net loss of some 75,000,000 yen per annum. This loss would, however, appreciably accelerate the present rate of exhaustion of the gold reserve, whilst the dislocation of industry and decrease of employment involved would add seriously to Japan&apos;s internal economic difficulties. If the United States also collaborated in import restriction measures, their effect on Japan would be produced within a considerably shorter period than if action was confined to the British Empire.Dominion and Indian Co-operation.29. It is, of course, essential to be sure that the Dominions and India would collaborate. A most unfortunate impression would be created if there were an open divergence of policy in this matter between the United Kingdom, Dominions and Indian Governments. It might be argued that the defence of British interests in China cannot be confined to the defence of individual British firms,
but must be regarded as a defence of the interests in the Far East not of the United Kingdom alone, but of the British Commonwealth generally. We are informed, however, that the fact that the economic pressure upon Japan which is now being-considered would be justified as a measure, not for restraining the aggression of Japan upon China, but as retaliation for injury done by Japan to British interests in China, would have a serious bearing upon the possibility of India&apos;s co-operation. The trade between India and Japan is a matter of very great importance to India; in China, however, her interests are comparatively small, and it cannot be said that they have been injured by the recent actions of Japan. This being so, tlhe Government of India would find very great difficulty in agreeing to the exercise of economic pressure by India upon Japan as a means of retaliating upon Japan for injury done to interests in China which are predominantly those of United Kingdom. It would be much more difficult to justify the acceptance by India of risks disproportionate to her interests in China in a scheme of economic action planned on the limited basis of reprisals than to justify her taking her due share in a more broadly based plan of general co-operation in exercising pressure upon Japan of which the burden was duly distributed among all those who stand for the observance of treaties and resistance to aggression. We understand, also, that similar considerations may be expected to arise in the case of some at least of the Dominions.VII. Machinery for Interfering with Japanese Exports.Embargo and/ or Quotas.30. In order to bring pressure to bear through interference with Japanese exports we think the most effective procedure would be to impose an embargo (or in the case of certain territories restrictive quotas) on goods coming from Japan, Japanese possessions and occupied territories (including Manchuria and North China) into the United Kingdom and the Colonies; the Dominions and India being asked to take corresponding action. A measure of this nature would require legislation and would involve, in order to prevent evasion, the require-ment of certificates of origin for all goods of the classes affected originating in other countries from which it might be possible for Japanese goods to be recon-signed. For the latter reason it would be most desirable, in order to create the minimum administrative difficulties for the other supplying countries and for our own Customs, to confine the restrictions to those classes of goods of which Japan is a principal supplier. It would be highly desirable, if it were practicable, not to prohibit imports from North China in which British firms operating in that area are interested. This might possibly be effected through directions given to Consuls in connection with the system of certificates of origin.Discriminatory Duties.31. A less drastic alternative to an embargo would be the imposition of discriminatory duties. The deterrent effect of a measure which extracts money from the Japanese producer for the benefit of the revenues of the countries importing Japanese goods should not be underestimated.Institution of a Clearing.32. A method of putting economic pressure on Japan which could be put into effect by the United Kingdom without any fresh legislation would be the institution of a Clearing under the Debts (Clearing Offices) Act, 1934. This Act was intended primarily to secure the payment of frozen debts, but in fact it is applicable to any case where payments or transfers to persons in the United Kingdom are subjected to restrictions. If it is decided that some retaliatory action should be taken immediately to strengthen the Ambassador&apos;s hands in the present negotiations this could be done by the institution of a Clearing as a first step.33. If a prohibition of imports from Japan is decided upon, a Clearing would prevent Japan from obtaining sterling in respect of debts outstanding in respect of trade which had already taken place.34.   If a Clearing were imposed, we should have power to require payment to the Clearing account of all debts due to Japan by United Kingdom importers and to apply the sterling so collected to the satisfaction of British claims.   The [19629] c
result might be that the Japanese would prohibit exports to the United Kingdom, in which case their trade would cease and they would lose the benefit of the balance in sterling which they at present enjoy. (As pointed out in paragraph 23, our trade would suffer if we were unable to import raw silk.) If, on the other hand, the Japanese propose a Clearing Agreement we could refuse to make any agree-ment unless we obtain arrangements satisfactory to us. We could stipulate for a better balance of trade between the two countries and require a substantial proportion of the sterling available to be used for the purchase of whisky and other non-essential imports which the Japanese at present prohibit. We could also insist not only on the payment of the service of the Japanese debts due to British holders, but on the satisfaction of financial claims of British subjects in respect of Japanese action in China including perhaps claims in respect of the user of Chinese railways on which British loans are secured. Altogether, we should be in a position to refuse an agreement unless we could secure a Clearing under which the Japanese obtained no free sterling from their trade with the United Kingdom. But, in either event, the pressure on Japanese finance is difficult to calculated35. It has been suggested that, if we enforced a rigid Clearing system between the United Kingdom and Japan, the Japanese might apply a similar system between Japan and the Dominions. But it appears improbable that the Japanese could take such a step. Their purchases from the Dominions consist almost entirely of raw materials which are essential for their industries and which they purchase from the Dominions only because the Dominions offer the most economic sources of supply. It is true that they might divert some of their purchases elsewhere, e.g., to South America, as Germany has done, but this would not affect raw materials with a world market.36. The Clearing would have to be applied to Japan itself alone; it could not be extended to cover Manchukuo or the occupied parts of China, as if we were to do this it would result in British firms in those countries being paid in Japanese currency (from which they would be expected to make payments in sterling for their London offices and to their shareholders), and it would inflict considerable hardship on the very persons whom we desire to protect.Consular certificates for North China exports.37. We have considered a limited proposal which has been strongly urged upon His Majesty&apos;s Government by the British communities in North China as a possible means of combating the exchange and trade control imposed there by the Japanese-sponsored puppet Government. Under this control permission to export goods from North China is not granted unless it is shown that the goods have been purchased with the Federal Reserve Bank currency, which can only be obtained through the Yokohama Specie Bank at an artificially high rate of exchange. The proposal is that North China goods shall be excluded from British Territory unless accompanied by a consular certificate attesting that the goods have been purchased with free exchange.  The United States Government,* There is a discrepancy between the Japanese trade returns and the British as to the balance of visible trade between the two countries. The former show for 1938 in million yen:Million yen.Imports from United Kingdom     ...       ...       ......       ... 63Exports to United Kingdom          ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 135Excess of exports     ....      ..;       ...       ...       ...       ...... 72The latter show:.: : W      -&apos;&apos;v0:-; :&apos;.!&apos;v .

If that be taken as 15 per cent, it would make the two estimates of the balance 81 millions of yen and 99 millions respectively. ,Invisible items would include debits against Japan for interest on British-held debt (estimated at some 60 millions of yen) and excess of British-earned freights on Japanese imports over Japanese-earned freights on British imports, estimated at 35 millions of yen. Though we have no comprehensive estimate of invisible items, it looks as if there might be no free balance of sterling to be withheld from Japan by a clearing. But it will be observed that that is on the assumption that payment of the interest on British-held bonds is maintained.
which has a world-wide system of consular invoices, consider that the system can be effectively used for any system of trade control which might be established by law in the United States. This measure would resemble a prohibition of imports from North China of the goods affected by the exchange restrictions, in requiring a general system of certificates of origin applicable at any rate to all alternative sources of supply that might be used as entrepots. Its result, if effective, would be the same as an embargo, since in practice these goods may not be exported at the present time from North China unless they have been financed with Federal Reserve Bank currency. As in the case of an embargo, legislation would be necessary.VIII. Financial Pressure.Japan&apos;s ability to secure credits.38. The general deductions in paragraphs 17-21 above are based on the assumptions that Japan will not be able to borrow abroad. Any comprehensive form of economic pressure against Japan would include steps to prohibit lending or granting credit to anyone resident or carrying on a business in Japan. But, in practice, this means very little change in the current state of affairs, for the amount of credit facilities which Japan obtains in this country is very small, and this is probably also true in the case of America, though this is a matter on which we have no definite information.Provision of facilities by other countries.39. It is possible that Japan might receive important facilities from other countries which might enable her to prolong her resistance to economic pressure from the countries of the British Empire for some considerable time. Even those countries which are most embarrassed in their finances can often afford to supply goods on credit. There are, however, obvious limitations at the present time to the development of these facilities on any large scale and in respect of the particular imports which Japan requires.-Sequestration of Japanese assets in London.40. Financial pressure on Japan might be made more effective if we could take measures to sequestrate all Japanese assets in London, as we did the Czecho-Slovak assets. But this would mean taking over control of Japanese banks and agencies in London and might seriously affect the position of London as a banking centre. The Japanese would almost certainly take analogous measures to sequestrate all British-owned properties in Japan or in the parts of China under their control. Such action could, therefore, not be recommended except as a last resort.Insurance.41. We have considered the suggestion which has been made in some quarters that Japan might be injured by the denial to her by British interests of insurance on Japanese ships and cargoes, and the following are our observa-tions after consultation with Lloyds.42. It is not possible to estimate the amount of insurance of Japanese vessels and cargoes carried in Japan but the proportion continues, to increase. A considerable but unknown proportion is reinsured in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Reinsurance covers in the United Kingdom, however, run for a year and could only be terminated by a month&apos;s notice prior to expiry. As they run from different dates they could not be terminated at any one date, and it would be possible for the Japanese to arrange for fresh facilities as from the expiry of these contracts. The United Kingdom would thus be the loser and once the business was lost it would not be regained.43. There might be cases, such as the insurance of the biggest passenger vessels, which the Japanese market would not have sufficient resources to cover, but it is to be anticipated that, sooner than lose any shipping business for this reason, the Japanese Government would itself effect the reinsurance. Similarly as regards the insurance of, e.g., third country cargoes in Japanese [19629] &apos; c 2
ships for which the cover would have to be in foreign exchange, the Japanese Government would presumably accept this liability, the more readily inasmuch as the premiums would be payable in foreign exchange and would be expected to cover the risks.44. There seems little doubt therefore that no effective action can be taken against Japan in this field.IX. Action against Japanese Shipping.45. In our 1937 review we came to the conclusion that interference with Japanese shipping could not be recommended as such a weapon was double-edged with its sharper side exposed to British interests.4&amp;. It can be assumed with reasonable certainty that any restrictions imposed by countries of the British Empire on Japanese shipping, e.g., by refusal of the use of ports and bunker facilities would be reciprocated by Japan. British shipping, however, is at present more vulnerable than Japanese to measures of exclusion imposed by the other country particularly having regard to the large proportion of Japanese shipping for the time being diverted to transport services connected with the operations in China. Figures extracted for a sample date show that, quite apart from shipping to Chinese ports con-trolled by the Japanese, the tonnage of British ships in and moving to Japanese ports was about double that of Japanese ships in or moving to British ports. It may be argued that some British Liner Services from the United Kingdom, which largely account for the preponderance of British tonnage, could Omit Japanese and Chinese ports from their itinerary without fundamentally altering the character of the Services, but there is little doubt that such omission would affect the profitability of such Services. For other British lines, however, such as those from India, Australia and Canada to Japan, the omission of Japan would totally stop the service. Moreover, it has to be remembered that the important tramp carryings to Japan would be entirely lost to British shipping if mutual prohibitions were imposed.47. British interference with Japanese shipping may be considered under three headings : &apos;(a) United Kingdom,(&amp;) Colonial, and(c) Dominions and India.Prohibition at United Kingdom ports would affect an appreciable volume of Japanese shipping, but the Japanese ships would still have the larger (and probably growing) Continental trade to engage in and develop. Prohibition at Colonial ports (including transit ports such as Singapore and Hong Kong) would undoubtedly seriously inconvenience Japanese shipping and cause them some direct loss* probably more than action in the United Kingdom would. It is in the Dominions (particularly Australia) and India that the policy of embargoes would most seriously hit Japanese shipping. These (Dominion and Indian) trades are from this point of view more important than the United Kingdom and Colonies taken together.General conclusions regarding action against Japanese shipping.48. We conclude from the above considerations that, whilst Japanese exclusion would seriously affect many British shipping interests, it would not necessarily affect the general stability of the whole industry. On the other hand, provided all the countries of the British Empire and the United States of America acted jointly, embargoes on Japanese shipping would cut off something like two-thirds of the trade of J apanese overseas snipping with very serious financial and political repercussions in Japan. It is doubtful whether embargoes on Japanese shipping in the United Kingdom and Colonies would jeopardise the financial stability of the Japanese shipping industry, but this threat would be much greater if the Dominions and India were included.* If, in addition, Japanese shipping was debarred from tbe use of ports in the Dutch East Indies, the effect would be, much greater.
49. In achieving this result, however, it seems quite certain that the volume of potential loss to British shipping from mutual exclusion would be much greater than that of the Japanese. Moreover, there are certain additional considerations to which we drew attention in our 1937 Report, viz., that, in the absence of trade restrictions, the carrying trades of non-participating countries would benefit (and thus secure a footing in the trades concerned from which it might be difficult to dislodge them later), while the use of the ships of third countries or the temporary transfer of Japanese ships to their flags would enable Japan still to carry the goods she needed. And, finally, it must be recognised that restrictions on shipping are always regarded as extremely provocative and likely to lead to drastic retaliation, and that the mere exclusion of ships may well result in &quot; incidents.&quot;50. Shipping reprisals need not be regarded as an essential part of trade restrictions. In fact the mere imposition of trade restrictions will automatically affect Japanese shipping to some extent and probably to a greater extent than the shipping of other nations normally engaged in carrying goods to or from Japan. Whatever decision is reached on measures designed to reduce Japanese trade we recommend that no action in the first instance should be taken in regard to Japanese shipping, but if in reply to other forms of pressure, Japan should place some form of restriction on our shipping we should be prepared to take corres-ponding action against Japanese shipping.X. Other Possible Measures.Denunciation of Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty.51. As indicated in paragraph 5 above, there is no legal necessity to denounce the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911 in order to justify the application of reprisals. Its denunciation, however, might form a useful supple-ment to concrete measures of economic pressure. We consider, however, that it would be unwise to denounce the Treaty in advance of such measures, though at some stage it would reinforce action already taken and impress on the Japanese the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government were in earnest. The effect of denunciation-tion would be heightened if it could be concerted with denunciation by the United States of the similar Japanese-American Commercial Treaty of 1911. It should, however, be noted that the Commercial Treaty applies to Canada (as a result of accession), and to Eire (as being part of the United Kingdom when the Treaty was concluded) and it is most improbable that either Canada or Eire would be willing to give notice of termination of the Treaty as between itself and Japan. Termination of the Treaty in respect of the United Kingdom might, therefore, well create the impression of a divergence of policy within the British Common-wealth.52. The principal measures of economic pressure referred to in this report would necessitate legislation in the United Kingdom and other countries concerned. This legislation could be drafted either in general terms so as to provide power to resort to retaliatory action in all cases where a treaty or rule of international law had been broken by a foreign country to the detriment of British interests, or with specific reference to Japan.. &apos;We recommend that consideration should be given to the question of having the empowering legislative measures ready in advance of the necessity for using them which might come suddenly.XI. Counter Effect upon the British Empire and Possible Japanese Counter-Action.53. We have been asked to assess the risks attendant upon taking measures of economic pressure against Japan.Counter effect of our own measures.54. The mere fact of taking certain measures will, ipso facto, have an adverse result on the trade of the territory concerned, even if the Japanese take no counter-action. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, imports to this country from Japan represent about 1 per cent, of our total imports, and exports
to Japan about - 4 per cent, of our total exports. In volume, therefore, the effect of complete suspension of the Japanese trade would be negligible, although in regard to one item raw silk it would produce considerable difficulties for the silk industry in this country. We have already suggested that J apanese raw silk should be excluded from any prohibited list of imports from Japan, but it is, &apos;0f course, possible that as a reprisal Japan might try to stop its export to this country, though having regard to her general economic position that appears to be unlikely.55. From Annex I it is clear that serious losses, both actually and propor-tionately in relation to their total volume of trade, will be caused to British Overseas Territories from any policy of trade restrictions. It is an anomaly of the Japanese situation that, whereas the trade interests at present being damaged in China are predominantly those of the United Kingdom, measures of retaliation can only be effected in the economic sphere at the expense of Colonial, Dominion and Indian interests. We dealt with this point in our 1937 paper and reproduce below the relevant paragraphs. We see no reason for any modification of the views therein expressed, except to add the qualification that, in so far as Japan can do without the raw materials supplied her by these territories, she is no doubt already limiting their importation very drastically.&quot; 21. The closing of Japanese markets to Australian wool, Indian cotton and jute and Malayan rubber, for example, would be relatively a much more serious matter for those countries, if they should be unable to find alternative markets, than the loss of Japanese trade with the United Kingdom. It is not possible to estimate how far alternative markets could be found without a prolonged and detailed study of international trade. In so far as Japan substituted staple fibre, &amp;c, for wool and cotton there would be a net and continuing loss to the producers of these raw materials.22. As regards India, we are advised that the elimination of Japanese trade would involve a number of special problems. The cessation of Japanese exports to India would cause a serious loss to the customs revenue, though it would bring profits to some Indian manufacturers. It would also tend to benefit some branches of British trade, especially that of Lancashire, and, although Indian sympathies appear to be strongly with China, a policy of economic pressure against Japan might, nevertheless, be represented in certain quarters in India as an attempt by His Majesty&apos;s Government to force British products, and cotton goods in particular, upon India. As regards Japanese imports from India, the Japanese market for raw cotton is of very great importance to India, and its loss would be a most serious matter to the producers, especially at a time when there is a surplus of raw cotton in the world. It may be anticipated that India would not be ready to face this strain upon her economic resources unless she was sure that the burden of economic pressure was being fairly shared among the States participating in it, and she would probably expect some relief from outside in respect of her cotton which fails to find a market.&quot;56. The above was the position when the proposal to exert economic pressure upon Japan was based upon the Covenant of the League, and its object was to restrain Japanese aggression upon China. The difficulty of India&apos;s co-operatioii would be increased by the considerations that have been mentioned at the end of paragraph 29.Counter-action by Japan.57. Unless our measures result in a change in Japanese policy, Japan would presumably take counter-action which might lie partly in the economic and partly in the political sphere.58.   In the economic sphere Japan could (a) default on the interest payments in respect of long-term indebtedness to British creditors estimated to be some  3-4 million per annum in respect of nearly  59 million capital invested in Japan and Japanese territory ;** The institution of a clearing (vide paragraphs 32-35) might be a safeguard against such a default provided our imports from Japan are not interrupted.
(&amp;) intensify restrictions and other discriminatory measures on British shipping in Japanese and Chinese waters a form of action which she is in fact already taking in certain directions in the guise of the exercise of maritime belligerent rights, although she has not declared a state of war with China;(c) intensify in China the measures restricting the commercial and industrialactivities of British firms in that country;(d) as a reply to an alleged infringement of the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty, discriminate against United Kingdom exports to and interests in Japan, and possibly against those of the Dominions and Colonies, though the character of her imports from those countries renders this less probable.There is, of course, no guarantee that these measures will not be taken even in the absence of economic pressure by us upon Japan.59. Further, it is possible that Japanese counter action would include measures in the political sphere. Counter action might, for example, take the form of the immediate occupation of the British Concession at Tientsin and of action against the British communities in North China, and perhaps in other parts of China, which it would be quite impossible to overlook. Clearly there is a risk of war which cannot be disregarded, but, if it could be secured that action by the countries of the British Empire would be supported by corres-ponding action on the part of the U.S.A., the situation would be totally different. How far, if at all, this risk can be mitigated by a gradual application of the measures referred to in our report is a matter which we consider to be outside our scope.XII.-CO-operation of other countries.Conclusions in 1937 Report.60. The basis of our report in 1937 was joint action by the countries of the British Empire and the U.S.A. In considering then the effect of support from other countries, we reached the following conclusions : &quot; (e) (i) As regards Japanese imports, the participation of any number of countries conceivable in present circumstances could not entirely prevent Japan from acquiring the necessary supplies of raw materials. Their participation would, however, increase the temporary dislocation-tion of Japan&apos;s trade and force her to pay higher prices for her supplies.(ii) The effect on Japanese exports would be more pronounced if the Netherlands, France, Egypt, Belgium, the U.S.S.R. and the Argentine co-operated, the period of &apos; between one and two years &apos; referred to in \c) above might be reduced by some months.&quot;The United States of America.61. As regards possible U.S.A. co-operation at the present time, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington in his telegram (No. 283) of the 26th June, 1939, expressed the view that the attitude of the United States was always less isolationist towards Far Eastern issues than towards European, and that the United States were most inclined to help those who help themselves. The Foreign Office view is that the best procedure for securing U.S.A. co-operation in exercising economic pressure on Japan would be to decide upon some definite action and, if possible, put it into operation before the support of that country is sought.62. We have already shown in our report that U.S.A. co-operation would accelerate very materially the grave deterioration of the Japanese financial situa-tion. We think that it would also influence active co-operation by the Dominions, particularly Canada.  The Government of India would regard it as indispensable.
The Netherlands.63. The position of the Netherlands Government is important in this matter principally because Japan derives a large proportion of her oil imports from sources situated in the Netherlands East Indies, and also because of the facilities which her East Indian ports would afford to Japanese shipping in the event of an embargo being placed On the use by that shipping of British ports. The official attitude of the Netherlands Government in the Sino-Japanese dispute has hitherto been one of cautious neutrality. There has, however, been close co-operation locally between the authorities in the Netherlands East Indies and at Singapore on other matters of joint interest where defence against Japanese encroachments is concerned. The Foreign Office consider it possible that some degree of collabora-tion in connexion with economic pressure exerted by the British Empire could be obtained in the same way, but that it is probable that the full co-operation of the Netherlands could only be obtained if the United States of America were a partner to any scheme of economic retaliation.France.64. The attitude of the French Government as expressed by the Foreign Minister to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris in connection with the Tientsin incident (see telegram No. 381, Saving) was that we could not take a really strong line with Japan without whole-hearted United States co-operation, and that we ought to avoid embarking upon any policy in the Far East which we could not carry through to the end. If, however, after due reflection, His Majesty&apos;s Government decided upon such a policy towards Japan, they could rely upon complete French support.*Summary of Conclusions.65.   Our report can be summarised as follows : (i) Measures of economic pressure referred to in the report would require legislation, but it would not be necessary to denounce the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911 (paragraphs 4-5).(ii) Owing to the suppression since October 1937 of certain relevant-statistics, information about Japanese stocks of strategic raw materials is meagre, but, except in the case of petroleum and nickel, they are thought to be low (paragraphs 6-8).(iii) A selective embargo on exports to Japan from the British Empire alone would not yield effective results and might permanently damage British interests. If the U.S.A. collaborated in such an embargo considerable inconvenience and extra expense would be caused to Japan, but she could not be prevented from obtaining the necessary raw materials, in the absence of war or an international system of rationing which is regarded as quite impracticable. Difficult problems would arise between the various Empire Governments (paragraphs 10-16).(iv) Subject to some reserve in view of certain unknown factors, it isestimated that on the 1st April, 1939, the Japanese gold reserve was of the order of 600 million yen, that up to that date gold exports had been continuing at the rate of 55 million yen per month, of which 20 million yen may have been met by home production. At this rate the estimated reserve would be exhausted in about a year and a half. More recent statistics point to a diminished rate of loss, but it is not certain whether this has any significance (paragraphs 17-21).* France has already taken certain measures constituting economic pressure upon Japan,. eg., the prohibition oh the export of mineral ores from Indo-China and the prohibition on the import of Japanese goods into French territory unless accompanied by certificates of origin. The latter measure has, in fact, enabled France to reach a satisfactory agreement within the last few weeks on commercial exchanges between the two countries.
(v) For practical and administrative reasons a complete import embargocould not be placed on every article of Japanese origin,, but, if the Dominions and India collaborated, it is probable that one-half of the Japanese exports of textile materials and manufactures (other than raw silk) to the British Empire could be cut off, as well as some of Japan&apos;s more important other exports (paragraphs 22-27).(vi) Restriction of Japanese exports on the above scale might exclude goods to the value of 100 to 120 million yen per annum. The net loss after allowing for reduced imports equivalent to the raw material content of excluded exports, might be some 60 to 75 million yen per annum. This would have a damaging effect on the Japanese economic situation. The collaboration of the U.S.A. would greatly accelerate the effect (paragraph 28).(vii) The attitude of the Dominions and India is of the utmost importance in relation to economic pressure on Japan. The collaboration of all the Dominion Governments and the Government of India is not likely to be secured for the defence of interests in China if regarded as pre-dominantly those of the United Kingdom (paragraph 29).(viii) (a) The most effective procedure for interfering with Japanese exports would be by embargo and quota. Discriminatory duties would be a less drastic alternative. If an embargo and quota system is imposed, it would not deprive the Japanese of sterling in respect of outstanding trade debts due to them, unless a Clearing were also imposed (para-graphs 30 and 31).(b) The institution of a Clearing under the Debts Clearing (Offices) Act, 1934, requires no fresh legislation and could be imposed immediately, though it is difficult to assess the effect on the Japanese exchange position. A Clearing&apos; should apply only to Japan and not to Manchukuo or North China (paragraphs 32 to 36).(c) Procedure by Consular Certificates for imports from North China is not recommended (paragraph 37).(ix) Any comprehensive form of economic pressure would be accompanied by a prohibition of lending or granting credit to Japanese organisations. Pressure in the insurance sphere is not practicable (paragraphs 38-44).(x) A refusal of the use of British Empire Ports to Japanese shipping would threaten the financial stability of the Japanese shipping industry. If the U.S.A. collaborated very serious financial and political repercussions would be caused in Japan. But Japan would place similar restrictions on British shipping. Mutual restriction would impose a much greater loss on British shipping and is open to objec-tion on other grounds. It is recommended that no action should be taken in the first instance against Japanese shipping (paragraphs 45-50).(xi) Denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911 is notrecommended in advance of the imposition of measures of economic retaliation (paragraph 51).(xii) Consideration should be given to the question of preparing empoweringlegislation in advance of the necessity to use it (paragraph 52).(xiii) As regards counter effects on the British Empire, of any measures ofeconomic pressure against Japan by far the largest part of the loss of trade would fall on the Dominions, notably Australia, and on India (paragraphs 53 to 56).(xiv) Japanese counter-action could take effect in both the economic andpolitical spheres untii ultimately British trade in and with China and Japan could be brought to a standstill. (There is no guarantee that such action will not be taken in the absence of retaliatory measures against Japan.) The risk of incidents leading to war cannot be dis-regarded, but this risk would bear a very different aspect if we had United States co-operation (paragraphs 57 and 59).r19629]d
(xv) Co-operation by the U.S.A. would greatly assist the effectiveness of measures of economic pressure and reduce the risk of violent counter-action.   The Foreign Office consider the best chance of obtaining it would be for the British Empire to initiate such measures in advance .  of U.S.A. support (paragraphs 60-62).(xvi) Co-operation by the Netherlands Government would be of appreciablevalue in certain circumstances, but is unlikely to be forthcoming until the U.S.A. is a partner to the retaliation scheme. French support can be relied upon for measures likely to be really effective (paragraphs 63 and 64).Signed on behalf of the Committee :; WALTER E. ELLIOT(Chairman).C. N.

ANNEX II.Position regarding Sources of Supply for Japanese. Requirements of Iron,Manganese and Wool.Iron.The production of iron in the Japanese yen bloc meets no more than 40 per cent, of Japan&apos;s requirements. The balance is imported principally as iron ore and scrap iron. The imports of the former amount to about 3 million tons per annum, half of which are derived from Japanese-owned mines in Malaya,* with the Philippines and Australia! as the next most important sources. The imports of scrap iron approximate to the iron content of the imported ore and come very largely from the U.S.A. The pig iron.import of some 700,000 tons, about one-third of which comes from British India, is comparatively small. If British Empire sources were cut off the stocks of scrap iron readily available on the Pacific coast of the USA. would be quite sufficient to meet Japan&apos;s full requirements until these could be provided by an increase in the U.S.A. production of iron ore and pig iron, an increase which would be very small compared to the potential output in the U.S.A. As regards Germany, in a report of the 28th June, 1939, by the Commercial Counsellor, Berlin, regarding the German ore position, it is stated that &apos;&apos; the maintenance of iron ore supplies is a matter of constant concern.&quot; Nevertheless, Germany might prove to be another source of supply of iron. It is usually taken for granted that, except for the present export of iron and steel manufactures which probably does not exceed 1 million tons, the whole German output of steel some 25 million tons per annum is required for domestic consumption for rearmament, for the 4-year plan, for the re-equipment of the- railways and for the reconditioning of industry in the Ostmark and Sudetenland. This may well be so, but there is no conclusive evidence that Germany could not, if she so desired, contribute an appreciable amount to Japanese needs.Manganese. . .:;.&apos;!Japan can only supply some 30 per cent, of her manganese requirements from her own resources and in 1937 she imported 213,000 tons of ore. The whole of this came from British India:): and Malaya.:j: The latest complete figures of world production are for the year 1936 and amount to 5,300,000 tons. Of this Russia produced 56 per cent, (and exported some 596,000 tons) and the British Empire 29 per cent. Brazil was also a producing and exporting country but export is limited by transport difficulties and production is largely in the hands of the U.S.A., which regards manganese as a strategic raw material. There is also some exportable surplus from Egypt, but this is under British control. Exports from Cuba and French Morocco are taken by the U.S.A. and France respectively.   Production in other countries is comparatively unimportant.Wool.In 1938 Japan&apos;s wool imports were only 50,000 tons which was about half the total for preceding years. She obtains over 80 per cent, of her import requirements (which amount to some 95 per cent, of her consumption) from the British Empire. For the 1937&quot;-38 clip the total world production of wool was 1,680,000 tons, of which the British Empire produced 46 per cent., the balance coming very largely from the U.S.A., Argentine and Uruguay.* The value of this export represents only 1 per cent, of Malaya&apos;s total exports.f At present there is, however, a complete prohibition on exports of iron ore from Australia.$ In 1937, 18 per cent, of the British India exports and all those from Malaya went to Japan.
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT       ^Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1939.SECRET Copy No. 4^TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 370th Meeting, held on July 27, 1939.W        - W -Tf Tv Tv(1)-ECONOMIC MEASURES TO RESTRAIN JAPAN FROM FURTHER ACTION INIMICAL TO BRITISH INTERESTS IN THE FAR EAST.(C.I.D. Paper No. 1575-B.^(Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 310th Meeting, Minute (3).)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War, dealing with the possibility of developing effective measures of an economic character with a view to restrain-ing Japan from further action inimical to British interests in the Far East (C.I.D. Paper No. 1575-B).Mr. ELLIOT introduced the Report and amplified the summary of con-clusions set out in paragraph 65 of the Paper. He drew special attention to conclusions (vi) and (vii) regarding, respectively, action against exports from Japan and the attitude of the Dominions and India. An embargo on Japanese exports to the British Empire coupled with the deterioration of her gold reserves would have a damaging effect on the Japanese economic situation, which would be greatly increased by the collaboration of the U.S.A. In order to secure this effect, however, the co-operation of the Dominions and India was essential; and this was not likely to be forthcoming in circumstances under which action against Japan took the form of retaliation for damage by that country to interests in China which primarily concerned the United Kingdom. The position was a difficult one and was set out fully in paragraph 29 of the Report.Mr. Elliot also referred to the possibility, not mentioned in the Report, of taking unofficial retaliatory measures against the Japanese, e.g., causing irritating delays to important Japanese liners by making difficulties over the issue of medical clearances. Such action would be accompanied by very polite apologies. It was felt that Japan would quickly realise the significance of such methods and that Great Britain had power to make matters awkward for her. On the other hand, such action would not involve loss of face and would not be so greatly resented as more overt action. A suggestion for action on these lines had emanated from the Foreign Office representative on the Sub-Committee. It was in line with the views of the ex-Naval Attache at Tokyo, whom he had recently seen, but it was not approved by the Sub-Committee generally and had not been incorporated in the Report.. [19718-1]
LORD STANHOPE enquired whether the position was altered by the recent announcement that the U.SA. Government were denouncing the Japanese-American Commercial Treaty of 1911.Mr. ELLIOT said that, so far as he knew, this had not yet been considered. He felt the view of his Sub-Committee would be that a mere denunciation of the Treaty would by itself be ineffective, and inadvisable unless it was followed by some more definite action.LORD HALIFAX said that the position had rather changed in the last week or ten days. A few days ago, in reply to an enquiry, the Ambassador at Tokyo had said that in present circumstances he was not anxious that legislation to cover retaliatory action should be introduced, but he suggested that, when the situation was easier, legislation in general terms should be passed which would not be aimed directly at the Japanese Government. In any case, he presumed it was now quite certain that legislation could not be introduced at present; and they had, therefore, to consider the steps which might be practicable without legislation, and how far it would be possible to secure the support of the U.S.A.. which would be necessary to make any measures really effective within a short time and without which, in fact, it might be imprudent to act. As regards unofficial reprisals, it might be wise to attempt them if they could be effectively applied, but on the broader aspects he was doubtful about adopting any policy which would annoy Japan unless he could be sure it would be effective.Turning to the question of co-operation by the U.S.A., he thought the position had been greatly changed by the sudden decision of the United States Government to denounce the Commercial Treaty of 1911 with Japan. This step had been taken without any consultation with us, and if we had known of it earlier, it might have led us to take a different line. The action now taken by the USA. might have a salutary effect on Japan.LORD CHATFIELD enquired whether this action did not affect the view set out in the last sentence of paragraph 61, viz. : &quot; The Foreign Office view is that the best procedure for securing U.S.A. co-operation in exercising economic pressure on Japan would be to decide upon some definite action and, if possible, put it into operation before the support of that country is sought.&quot;LORD HALIFAX agreed that it would be advisable to review the position. Hitherto he had had in mind to make a general statement to the U.S.A., explaining our position in regard to Japan and endeavouring to obtain their support without directly asking for it. He felt it was now necessary to have a little more time to consider our best course of action. In any case, whilst the present highly delicate negotiations were being undertaken, he thought it would be inopportune to take action of a rather provocative nature against Japan.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought that the question of retaliatory measures against Japan was rather academic at the present time, whilst negotiations were going on with that country. It seemed to him clear that the result of those negotia-tions should be awaited before any further action was taken. The Cabinet had not yet decided that a policy of reprisals should be adopted. Such a policy would profoundly affect our international relations generally, and would bring in another enemy against us. It was clearly a question of the highest policy, which could only be decided by the Cabinet. For the moment he thought it would be quite sufficient if the conclusions of the Report were noted.SIR EDWARD BRIDGES suggested that the Committee ought perhaps to go a little further and decide whether they agreed with the views set out in the Report as to the degree of effectiveness of the various alternatives, and whether the Report generally was a sound appreciation of the position.SIR THOMAS INSK1P said that he was doubtful whether sub-para-graph (vii&quot;) of the Summary in paragraph 65 went far enough in representing the views of the Dominions. The interests of Australia and New Zealand in China were so small that they could only be expected to act on the basis of loyalty to Great Britain in any action she might feel it necessary to take. In view of the character of the action contemplated, he was doubtful whether these Dominions should be asked to act.   If Great Britain decided to take action, however, he was
Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (i) To take note of the conclusions of the Report by the Advisory Committee on Trade Questions in Time of War on economic measures to restrain Japan from further action inimical to British interests in the Far East (C.I.D. Paper No. 1575-B). (ii) That the Report, together with the Minutes of the discussion, should be forwarded to the Cabinet for information.4&amp; ^Richmond Terrace, S.TF. 1, July 27, 1939.particularly anxious that he should be given as much notice as possible, and that there should be no question of an informatory telegram having to be sent to the Dominions at the last moment.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that approval of the present Report did not commit any Department to any active step. He felt that at the present time, and in the light of our other commitments, we already had sufficient troubles with Japan without increasing them.LORD HALIFAX observed that the possibility of having more trouble in the long run by taking no action than by taking some action could not be entirely ruled out. At the same time, he fully agreed with the Secretary of State for Air, and he suggested that the Report should be transmitted to the Cabinet for information and be held available should the Cabinet at some later date decide to take retaliatory action.LORD ZETLAND said that it was clear that, unless India and the Dominions co-operated, any retaliatory action would be ineffective. The con-siderations referred to by the Secretary of State for the Dominions applied with greater force to India. There was no doubt that India would be very unwilling to co-operate in the present circumstances. Her interests in China were very small, whereas in Japan they were very large. Moreover, if she took economic action against Japan, she would be highly vulnerable to Japanese counter-action.SIR CYRIL NEWALL said that he hoped that the risks attendant on taking measures in retaliation against Japan would not be overlooked. They were referred to in telegram No. 780 from Tokyo and also in C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 61.
