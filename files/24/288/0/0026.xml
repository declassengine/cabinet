I append to this paper a copy of Lord Riverdale&apos;sReport on his mission to the United States in relation to the establishment of purchasing arrangements in that country (Annex B).     Lord Riverdale, it will be remembered, undertook to proceed to the United States of America at very short notice.2. It was essential that the matter should he kept secret and this object has been fully secured.    We are, I think, deeply indebted to Lord Riverdale for his assistance and for the report which he has made.3. I thought it best in the first instance to have thereport considered by an interdepartmental meeting representing the departments of Government concerned.     A note of this meeting is also attached (Annex A).h. It will be seen that the that the note proposes(paras, 5 and 6) as a first step, that a small number of officers should be sent as quickly as possible to Canada inthe/
is?the first instance and that from there they should put in hand arrangements for the opening of a purchasing commission in New York, which could he developed on the lines in Appendix A to Lord Riverdale&apos;s report.5. I recommend that this proposal he approved, subjectto any comment from H.M. Ambassador at Washington with whom I understand the Foreign Office are in communication.6. I would add two general observations.    Both inregard to munitions and in regard to raw materials, oil and food stuffs, the advance war preparations on the supply side have envisaged very large purchases both from the United States and from Canada.7. But on the financial side the grave difficulty ofmaking such large purchases from the point of view of the exchange position has been insisted upon and the necessary balance between the two aspects has not been arrived at.    It appears to me that this matter requires immediate and effective handling and. especially that, if proper supply arrangements are to be made, approval must at once be given for an instalment of expenditure in the two countries, which can be rationed between the departments and action taken accordingly.    This matter has obviously a great bearing on the type of full purchasing commission which we should establish.8. A further point affecting the problem as regards theUnited States of America is the action which the United States may take as to its neutrality legislation.    Lord Riverdale, in his report and verbally, is most insistent on the danger of our being associated with any attempts to evade that legislation.    The Foreign Office will no doubt advise as quickly as possible what the prospects are in this regard.
fi 0SUMMARY.9- That steps he taken to select and despatch officers as in paragraph 6 of the note appended to this memorandum and that appropriate machinery he set up to deal with the problem raised in paragraph 7 of the memorandum itself,initd.   (L.B.)The Adelphi,26th August, 1939.
Annex, A..Note of interdepartmental Conference on23rd August as to Lord Riverdale&apos;s report,. .The Report of Lord Riverdale on his secret mission to the United States was considered at an interdepartmental conference under the Chairmanship of Sir Arthur Robinson, on the 23rd August - departments represented - Foreign Office, Treasury, Admiralty, Air Ministry, Board of Trade, Ministry of Supply, 2, It was agreed that the Foreign Office should atonce ascertain the views of the Embassy at Washington. 3, It was pointed out on behalf of the Treasurythat the central proposal in the report i.e. to establish forthwith a purchasing commission in New York for supplies immediately required by the Service Departments to expand by stages (see Appendix A) into a full supplies commission cannot be disassociated from the grave exchange difficulties involved in extensive purchases from the United States of America and also from Canada.      It was pointed out also that action is being taken by the Treasury to obtain forthwith the closest possible estimate of requirements in peace and in war, with the object of considering the whole position and, if need be, establishing a system of rationing and priorities. 1+. It was nevertheless agreed that on merits , andon the political ground,  if His Majesty1s Embassy at Washington confirm Lord Riverdale&apos;s views as to the latter, action ought to be taken as quickly as it can to send over the necessary complement of officials to inaugurate the mission.5. It was thought essential to take account of theposition in the Dominion of Canada at the same time as of that in the Unites States of America.      There is in this
9 ft n* y .Jcountry at present a strong industrial mission from the Dominion, which came over with the full concurrence of the Dominion Government, for the purpose of studying on the spot here methods of armament and munitions stores production, and judging what further contribution Canadian industry could make to the rearmament needs of the United Kingdom.     The -understanding on which this mission came over was that the problem to be studied was what sort of educational orders could suitably be placed in the Dominion by way of forming an enlarged war potential situated in a safer country.      It is clear that educational orders to a substantial amount can be advantageously placed in the Dominion.      The extent of these requires to be settled by reference to the exchange difficulties.      But it was agreed that a purchasing commission must be sent from this country to the Dominion, and that this and the question of a mission to the United States are best tackled together.6. It was agreed that the first step should be to get together a suitable staff for despatch to Canada as quickly as may be,  (if possible by the 2nd of September on which date the Chairman of the Canadian Mission returns to Canada) and that this staff should consist of an administrative officer of high standing accompanied by a contracts and a finance officer,  at least of the grade of assistant director, and by three technical officers representing the Admiralty, Air Ministry and Ministry of Supply respectively.     The immediate function of these officers would be to arrange for such additional contracts as can be placed at once in Canada.      At the same time they would be instructed to take the necessary action to establish a purchasing organisation in New York somewhat on the lines of the first stage envisaged by Lord Riverdale in Appendix N to his Report.
The view was expressed on &quot;behalf of the Foreign Office that for the moment as little public attention as possible should be attracted to the U.S.A. part of the business and the above proposals would fit in with that view. 7. Steps to expand the mission on the lines recommended by Lord Riverdale would be concerted, as the Exchange situation is cleared up and also the position regarding the U.S.A. neutrality legislation in the event of war.

Hon. Lord Riverdale of Sheffield, K.B.E., LL.D.,to the Minister of Supply.On Board s.s. Empress of Britain, My dear Burgin, Eastbound, August 14, 1939.I NOW have the pleasure to hand you my report on the Mission with which you entrusted me to the United States and Canada.I hope you will find that I have answered the following points fully :-(a) To accept the invitation of the Hon. Louis Johnson, Assistant Secretaryof War, and to discuss with him and other Departments how the good-will which exists towards the British can best be maintained and developed.(b) The setting up of a purchasing organisation in New York.(c) The means of co-operating with the Canadian Department of defence and the Canadian Defence Purchasing Board.In conclusion, I do wish to express my sincere thanks for the splendid help which I received from all parties at the Embassy in Washington, and Mr. Haggard, the British Consul-General in New York.I am at your disposal for discussions on the report or with any Department on matters affecting them specifically.Yours sincerely,RIVERDALE.[19848]b
ENCLOSURE.Report on the Mission by the Rt. Hon. Lord Riverdale of Sheffield, K.B.E., LL.D., to Washington, New York and Ottawa, August 1939.The mission with which I was entrusted divides itself into two headings : 1. To accept the invitation of the Hon. Louis Johnson, Assistant Secretary of War, to visit Washington to get in touch with him and the other Departments of State with a view to discussing our immediate requirements and our require-ments in case of war, and developing a system- of close co-operation.2. To determine whether we should set up a nucleus purchasing commission now and, if so, where and under what conditions; what form that purchasing commission should take in case we were at war and America was not; and again, the purchasing commissions position if America was in a war with us; and, further, what our relations would be with our Allies, i.e., France, Turkey, &amp;c, in regard to purchasing munitions and stores from the United States of America.In regard to the first half of my mission, after arriving in Washington I very early realised that the splendid work which the Ambassador had done, and all the members of his Staff, had created widespread sympathy towards Great Britain, particularly in regard to our war preparations. Without this ground-work, prepared over a long period, it would not have been possible for me to accomplish as much as I did in four days.My visit has, I hope, precipitated the goodwill, which was in a floating condition, and directed it into practical channels and laid plans as to what must be done to maintain and develop it under the varying conditions of war and particularly in view of the impediments of the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act.On Monday, the 31st July, accompanied by Sir Owen Chalkley, I called upon Mr. Joseph C. Green, Chief Officer of the Arms and Munitions Control at the Department of Foreign Affairs, who is the gentleman referred to in cables to London requesting me to be in Washington on the 31st July so that I might see him before he left on his vacation.Mr. Green emphasises the importance of setting up a nucleus purchasing commission forthwith so that they might have a definite party with whom they could deal. The question was then raised as to whether or not a purchasing commission would have to be incorporated in the United States as an American Company, as in the case of the Amtorg Trading Corporation for the Russians and the Wall Chang Trading Corporation and the Universal Trading Corporation for the Chinese. I am dealing with this point in a separate memorandum, so I will not enlarge upon it here (see Appendix &quot; A &quot;).We discussed with Mr. Green the Neutrality Act, and Mr. Green pointed out that the prohibited list, while large, is not completely prohibitive of many things which we might require. I asked him if forgings and castings were prohibited, and he gave me a pamphlet, the fifth edition of &apos;&apos; International Traffic in Arms,&quot; and showed me Paragraph 29, Page 19, which specifically says that forgings and castings are prohibited, provided they have reached &quot; such a stage of manufacture that they are clearly identifiable as forgings or castings for arms, ammunition and implements of war.&quot; The pamphlet is enclosed herewith as Appendix &quot; B &quot; (not printed).Mr. Green assured us that, within the powers they have, we can depend on their entire co-operation, and he has a strong feeling that, in case of war, the prohibitions and difficulties under which we suffer by the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act would definitely be overcome, but this would mean Congress meeting.Mr. Green then conducted us to the Hon. Louis Johnson, Assistant Secretary of War, on whose direct invitation I had come to Washington.Mr. Johnson has been the moving spirit in setting up the Board to examine and report on the industrial capacity of the country to produce munitions and to organise the production. Particularly is he responsible for the placing of &quot; educational orders&quot;  with manufacturers who have not  previously made
Sir Owen Chalkley accompanied me on my visit to Mr. Johnson, and the latter called in Colonel James H. Burns, who is his Chief Executive.I can report that they are both anxious to help us in every possible way. They not only consider it advisable, but imperative, that we should set up some nucleus purchasing commission forthwith to be extended into a full purchasing commission if war was declared, and they assured me of their utmost co-operation.They explained to me what the previous and recent French Mission had done, and we agreed in conversation that some kind of a quota arrangement between us, the French, and any other Allies, would ultimately be necessary; but we gathered at this interview and at other interviews that the full co-operation which we may expect does not necessarily imply that this would be open to the same extent to the French or any other of our Allies, at least for the present.To carry the matter further, Colonel James H. Burns and General Harris of the War Department visited me at the- Mayflower Hotel, and we went into great detail as to our requirements, as to how they conflicted at the moment with theirs, as to the United States future programme, and generally explored the situation from every angle with facts before us. This was on Tuesday, the 1st August.They also explained to me the methods they had pursued for preparing to place the industry of this country on a war basis. Summarising these discussions, they agreed (a) That, generally speaking, they could see no reason why our requirements for the next two years, provided there is no war in which they are involved, could not reasonably be fulfilled.(b) Regarding machine tools, they say that, while the industry is busier than.it has been for some time, there is still much latent capacity, and the details of the machine tools required by the War Office as shown in. the memorandum handed to me would be spread over so many concerns that quite reasonable deliveries could be expected.(c) They would go fully into the question as to what unused capacity existed in this country for making tanks, guns, &amp;c, and send me a memorandum on this point.(d) They told me in confidence they were placing orders for $175,000,000worth of aircraft (and since I saw them orders have actually been placed for $160,000,000). They also informed me that the capacity of this country per annum was $225,000,000 and capable of some expansion, possibly up to $240,000,000, which should leave a margin for export and civil aviation.(e) As regards aero engines, they told me that some of the makers are not fully occupied, and they quote Pratt and Whitney particularly, who could take more orders at the present time.(/) I asked them what the possibility would be of getting naval mines here, and they told me that at least twelve firms could make them who were only making a few now for the Navy Department, and they could fill even a very large order quickly, it being understood, of course, that the explosive filling would be done on our side. They could also supply the mooring tackle.(g) While these gentlemen, of course, could take no responsibility for any-thing which goes beyond the Johnson Act or the Neutrality Act, they are both convinced that if war actually happened, Congress would quickly repeal both these Acts.On leaving me, these two gentlemen made a complete and detailed written report to the Hon. Louis Johnson, who received me for the second time on Thursday, the 3rd August. He informed me that he was highly satisfied with the report which had been presented to him, so much so, that he thought my visit to Washington at his request had been well justified and he himself had taken the report to the President and had shown him what we were trying to do. The President expressed himself as 100 per cent, in favour of what we are doing.This memorandum also dealt with the question as to whether, in the first stages, we should have to incorporate as an American Company.   The President wished to think this over, but it was his opinion that it would not be necessary [19848] b 2
and he would try and find some means of avoiding this for us, and seeing what further suggestions he could make to facilitate the liaison which it is proposed to set up.The Hen. Louis Johnson expressed his anxiety to me that no time should be lost in forming our first nucleus purchasing commission, and he attached great importance to having a strong liaison officer in Washington who could go direct to him and the heads of the Departments when necessary, and that we should then have an organisation which could easily be expanded on the declara-tion of war, whether America was involved or not.He did, however, touch on the important question as to how we should work with the French. He leaned strongly towards the idea that they (U.S.A.) would prefer to work alone with the British in the first instance, and also in the second (when we were in the war and they were not).He asked me to express his appreciation of the prompt way in which His Majesty&apos;s Government had responded to the invitation that somebody should go out to Washington and discuss the whole position. We certainly have a very good friend in the Hon. Louis Johnson and the people in his Department with whom we came into contact.They are prepared to discuss with us at any time the best contractors with whom to place orders for war material, to place at our disposal their contract forms, conditions and specifications (except a few secret specifications) and to assist us in every way possible to ensure quick deliveries and reasonable prices.On the morning of Thursday, the 3rd August, accompanied by Sir Owen Chalkley, I called on Admiral Ray Spear, Chief of the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, Navy Department.This Bureau maintains special purchasing agents in New York and other large centres of supply; also regional inspection agencies, one in Pittsburgh. The Bureau purchases everything except warships and dry-docks.Regarding liaison in New York, Admiral Spear suggested that Captain Henry Mell, officer in charge of Navy Purchasing Agency, Federal Building, New York, N.Y., might be kept in touch with for general information, but that questions of policy, of course, have to come to Washington, and for this purpose they thought it very important that we should have a competent liaison officer stationed in Washington. Admiral Spear is also prepared to give us the form of contract and specifications which they use, as it appeared to him that if we could adopt American phraseology and style, it would help considerably in the manufacturers here understanding our specifications.He strongly welcomed the suggestion that we should set up a nucleus purchasing commission, and assured us of the utmost co-operation.Admiral Spear then made the suggestion that it might be possible at some later stage for the British liaison officer to have direct contact with the Army and Navy Munitions Board, and even mentioned the possibility of our liaison officer being a member of the Board. This Board will be found in Appendix &quot; G &quot; (not printed).While it seemed to us that this would not be possible until America had come into the war, it showed the anxiety of the Bureau and its officials to be as helpful as possible. The Admiral promised to study this idea of his further, although he recognised that it was a matter of high policy subject to the State Department, and he thought we might hear something further in regard to it, even if our liaison officer was only an observer.On my raising the question as to whether mines, sinkers and fitments appertaining thereto could be bought in this country at the present time without inconveniencing the Navy Department, Admiral Spear took us to Admiral Furlong, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance.Admiral Furlong said he was quite certain we could obtain what we required in this direction without difficulty, and he went further and offered to look up the names of the firms who supplied during the last war. He will ascertain whether they are still in existence, and, if so, their capacity, and he will send this information to Sir Owen Chalkley to be passed on to me.During the discussion of armour plate, we were asked whether we would like light armour plate, as they thought there was capacity here of which we could make use, as their real bottle-neck is the machining problem at the moment, and not the problem of forged and heat-treated plates.
Admiral Furlong expressed his entire willingness to help us as much as possible and to work with any organisation which we might set up.On Wednesday, the 2nd August, accompanied by Sir Owen Chalkley, I called on the Procurement Division of the Treasury and saw Captain H. E. Collins, the Director, and I attach Appendix &quot; C &quot; (not printed), a sheet from the Congressional Directory, showing what this Department is and the headings of the subjects which he discussed with us.Captain Collins went into great detail with us as to what their Department do buy, and its organisation, which is on a very large scale indeed. They keep stocks valued at over f 1,000,000, and they standardise the stationery and general supplies of all Government Departments. They have a Planning Department which seems to investigate methods of obtaining lower prices and particularly with a view to breaking down &quot; rings.&quot; They have forty-three agents through-out the country under which they buy the materials for the relief schemes; they have their own insjDection department and use the Bureau Standards to a considerable extent.They welcome the idea of a purchasing commission in New York and would certainly co-operate with our liaison officer in Washington and give us any information we might require, both in regard to where to buy specific articles and how the buying can be done to the best possible advantage.Captain Collins, as all the officials we have met, seemed convinced that the moment war is declared, both the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act are bound to be revised.On Thursday, the 3rd August, accompanied by Mr. Pinsent, Financial Adviser at the Embassy, I called on Mr. John W. Hanes, Under-Secretary of the Treasury, and we had a talk over a very wide field, including the American and British Budgets and the proportion which is being spent on defence, and particularly in regard to the position created by the old War Debt.Mr. Hanes explained to me that the West to-day still does not understand the difficulty of transfer, and the people believe that the Johnson Act is the best instrument they have for keeping them out of a war. He does not agree with this and he finally expressed the opinion that the only solution of the old War Debt would be to settle on a reasonable sum and fund it over a hundred years; he believes that this could be sold to the country if the opportune moment was taken for it and it was managed cleverly.It appears he was interested in a big airplane company (the Glen Martin) which has bought the patent rights for making airplanes from plastic materials, and he told me they have now produced an airplane almost wholly from plastic materials which answers all tests to which an airplane could be put. He believes we are on the verge of a revolutionary change in regard to the manufacture and cost of aircraft.We talked over the German situation in some detail.Mr. Hanes said on leaving that if there was anything they could do for the British, would we please let him know and he hoped I had received all the assistance I had needed from all the other Departments I had visited, and I was happy to tell him that this was the case.Mr. Hanes, in conversation, said he regretted, of course, there was much loose thinking in the States, and that the people did not think it was a mistake to go on spending more than they were raising in taxes.I take this opportunity of mentioning that in every direction, in private discussions, and in cartoons in the newspapers, the non-payment of the War Debt by Great Britain is quoted in rather an antagonistic spirit, and while this is very detrimental, I do not think that in the last resource it would stand in the way of the abolition of the Johnson Act if war actually occurred.State Department for Foreign Affairs. I met Mr. J. Pierrepont Moffat privately. He is the gentleman in charge of the European Section of the Depart-ment of Foreign Affairs. He also called upon me at my hotel and spent some time with me. I would like to record he has been most helpful in arranging all my appointments for me and enabling me to do so much work in so short a time. We are certainly very much indebted to him for the continual help and sympathy which he gives us.In various discussions which I have had, the possibilities of using the Export-Import Bank of Washington as a means of raising credits has been considered.
I attach Appendix &quot; K &quot; (not printed), Executive Order No. 6581, in regard to the formation of this Bank.While this Department holds that it is more or less outside the Johnson Act, I think it is clear that if it came to a test case they would not infringe the Johnson Act.In the meantime, to show what they are doing for the Chinese Government, I attach Appendix &quot; D &quot; (not printed) from which it will be seen they have given a small credit of $85,000 for sulphur to the Wah Chang Trading Corporation and a much higher credit of $25,000,000 for agricultural and manufacturing products to the Universal Trading Corporation, of which latter sum $15,840,000 remains unused.The Johnson A ct and the Neutrality A ct. Mr. Pinsent has very kindly pre-parecl for me a memorandum dated the 24th July, and also a further memorandum of the 27th July, both of which throw valuable light on these two Acts and I attach them herewith as Appendix &quot; E &quot; (not printed).As everybody we have seen has volunteered that these two Acts would have to be abolished in case of war, it might be well for me to enlarge upon the reasons. There is a strong feeling in Washington that it is quite possible that America will be at war with Japan before we are at war with Germany, and that in this case America would need our help in regard to blockading Japan.In the second place, many American concerns who have branches in Canada and others who have not, are prepared to move their plant and equipment into Canada to make munitions for us there if they are not allowed to do so at home, and several large concerns have actually made all the preliminary arrangements for doing so.In view of the unemployment situation in the United States, any action of this kind would be very much resented particularly if the Canadian Works were full of work with no unemployment, and the position in the United States had not considerably improved. Attached is Appendix &quot; L &quot; (not printed) which is a chart showing &quot; Twenty years of Unemployment &quot; in the United States and it will be noted that in spite of the immense sums of money, amounting to thousands of millions of pounds, which have been spent in the last seven years, unemployment to-day is still approaching 11,000,000.While this state of affairs exists there would be a tremendous public outcry if the United States manufacturers were not allowed to help Great Britain and France in suplying them with their munition requirements.I should also mention that there is deep resentment in the United States owing to the fact that Germany has Nazi emissaries in their country, to try and influence not only German-born people living in the States, but also people with German-born parents, with the intention of creating a discontented minority, and it is also well understood that Germany is taking similar steps in the Argentine and other countries of South America in which the United States feel themselves directly interested, in order to breed discontentment with a view to increasing their influence and seizing the trade of those countries.This is where the United States&apos;s self-interest comes in and it might well be the deciding factor in the United States joining the war if Britain and her Allies found themselves in any sort of difficulty.Specifically as regards the Johnson Act, it is felt in Washington that the United States would very quickly be faced with the position that they must either cancel the Johnson Act and be prepared to lend Great Britain very con-siderable sums of money with which to buy munitions, or they would be immedi-ately drawn into the war. There is no question as to the course which the public would wish the Administration to take in the first instance.I cannot emphasise too strongly the importance of taking no roundabout steps to evade either the Johnson Act or the Neutrality Act so far as we in Great Britain are concerned. Nothing would give the pacifists and the isolationists better ammunition than our having employed roundabout methods to evade these Acts.Exchange. In all our discussions, we almost invariably came back to the serious question of the exchange, and I pointed out to the officials how urgent it is that their country should buy more from us.In 1938 we purchased from the United States $521,000,000 and they only purchased from us $118,000,000. The estimate for the first half of 1939 is that we purchased  53,300,000 and they only purchased  13,600,000.
It is obvious that the strain on our gold and securities would immediately be very severe in case of war. I assume that everything has been done to analyse our imports from the United States, to see whether something can be done now to reduce them or what prohibitions could be put into force immediately on declaration of war to steady the position; on the other side, no doubt our exports to the United States have been examined to see whether they cannot be increased.I assume the Trade Agreement was framed with the object of improving this position, but so far, of course, owing to the fact that we have had to buy aircraft, engines and machine tools in large quantities from the United States, the position is steadily becoming worse.I would emphasise that it is very important we should, buy everything we require for munitions now as we shall have no trouble in getting licences. The exchange is as favourable as it is going to be and last but not least, we are getting peace-time quality and we know from the experience of the last war that quality all round tends to degenerate when pressure for delivery is the main factor.With Sir Owen Chalkley, both in Washington and New York, I spent some time interviewing various gentlemen who might be of assistance to us in case of war. I am not going into any details as Sir Owen Chalkley has these, but I will be ready to discuss them in London should the occasion arise.On Tuesday, the 1st August, learning from Colonel James H. Burns and General Harris the programme of the American Government in regard to aircraft and also the fact that Pratt and Whitney had latent capacity for engines, I thought it important that the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Supply should be advised of this fact at the earliest possible moment, and therefore I sent you a secret cable, dated the 2nd August, of which I attach a copy (Appendix &quot; F &quot;) (not printed). As mentioned above, the major portion of this requirement has been ordered since the 2nd August.French Military Mission. In Appendix &quot; H ?&apos; (not printed), I enclose a short review of this Mission&apos;s work. Actually they have not placed any orders at all, but left leaving one of their members here as an observer, and at the Embassy we discussed the advisability of my seeing this gentleman to find out really what steps they intended taking and we came to the conclusion that it would be better to leave this for our Military Attache to keep in touch with the French Military Attache.I now learn that the French military observer is likely to return home, but I take this opportunity of mentioning that the whole question of our working with the French or any other Allies in case of war would become a question of major importance, on which some decision should be taken at no distant date.Educational Orders. As mentioned above, the Hon. Louis Johnson has been the prime mover in this matter, and as Appendix &quot;I&quot; (not printed) I enclose a list showing that $48,000,000 has been the aggregate cost of these &quot; educational orders.&quot; and the names of the Advisory Board who have helped in the placing of them. ?I learn very confidentially that on the whole these &quot;educational orders &quot; have not given the results which were hoped for from them, and that real produc-tion by the concerns with whom they have been placed has not yet resulted.National Munitions Control Board. I enclose herewith as Appendix &quot; J &quot; (not printed) the third Annual Report for the year ended the 30th November, 1938, and I would draw particular attention to page 81 dealing with the violations and the attempted violations and the legal restrictions on the export of arms.I take this opportunity of saying that should we set up a purchasing commis-sion, it would, of course, be necessary for us to obtain licences, either through the purchasing commission or through the manufacturers, for any munitions which we wished to export, but I am sure that this would raise no difficulty, and every assistance would be given to us.Canadian Defence Purchasing Board. Before leaving London I discussed with Sir Arthur Robinson the importance of keeping in touch with Canada so that they did not feel offended at anything we were doing in the States and think we were overlooking them in regard to munitions with which they could provide us.I therefore went to Ottawa and interviewed Mr. R. C. Vaughan, the Chairman of this Purchasing Board.
Before doing so, however, I had an interview with Colonel Lafleche, Deputy Minister of the Department of Defence. I found that matters were not running at all smoothly, and the manufacturers in Canada seem to think that the Defence Department have not taken sufficient trouble to keep in touch with Great Britain and obtain orders for munitions for them. The Defence Department have undoubtedly been restricted by political considerations from doing much that they would have wished to, and finally the manufacturers refused to discuss matters with the Defence Department and insisted on seeing the Prime Minister. Subsequently, the Mission was arranged, which is now in England, accompanied by General McNaughton and Colonel Carr. They are hoping to bring back with them considerable orders for munitions and plant.Colonel Lafleche is of the opinion that finally we may have to set up a purchasing commission or an Imperial Munitions Board in Canada if it comes to war. There is, of course, no doubt that the setting up of this Canadian Defence Purchasing Board has cut across the activities of the Defence Department very considerably.I spent two hours with Mr. Vaughan discussing his problems and he in his turn finds it very difficult to do anything at all as his Board was set up by Act of Parliament (Appendix &quot;M &quot; not printed) and in paragraph 7 it is set forth that the profit &apos;&apos;. shall be limited to an amount equal to 5 per centum per annum on the average amount of capital of such person employed in the performance of the contract.&quot;First of all, he is finding that nobody is willing to work for 5 per cent, as it is too fine a margin for orders for special materials, and, secondly, it is being found quite impossible to discover what is the average amount of capital employed in the fulfilment of the contract.Mr. Vaughan has made representations to the Prime Minister regarding the hopeless position in which he finds himself, and the Prime Minister has promised to revise this portion of the Defence Purchases, Profits Control and Financing Act, 1939.The general opinion is that it will be found extremely difficult to get this revision through the House. I was in Ottawa when the original Act was being discussed, and I told the Minister of Defence then that I was convinced they would find this portion of the Act unsatisfactory and unworkable.It is quite clear to me that we should not be able to use Mr. Vaughan&apos;s Purchasing Board for our purpose at all, but that it could only be used for purchases for the Canadian Government.My visit, however, was well worth while, as it quite completely removed any misunderstanding and Mr. Vaughan asked me whether, if we set up purchasing arrangements in New York,- he could keep in touch with them, and I told him I saw no reason to doubt that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be pleased for him to do so.New York. On Friday, the 4th August, I had a preliminary discussion with Mr. Haggard, the British Consul-General in New York, as to what steps we might take to accommodate a nucleus purchasing commission there, and I also had my first discussion with Mr. G. O. May, of Price, Waterhouse and Company, as to whether incorporation would be necessary.On Monday, the 7th August, I had a long talk to Group-Captain G. C. Pirie, Air Attache at the Embassy in Washington, on the whole question, and informed him in regard to the telegram which I had sent to the Ministry of Supply and the Air Ministry. This information fitted in closely with the information he had been able to obtain, but his information was more in volume than in value. I gave him the information which I obtained from Mr. Hanes regarding the pro-duction of aircraft by plastic pressing, and generally posted him up as to every-thing that had been said to me in regard to aircraft.Particularly I called his attention to the fact that the Ministry of War informed me that they had aircraft with Pratt and Whitney engines which could fly at 525 miles per hour, but they were having very consfderable difficulties in regard to pilots at these speeds, and even much lower, standing the strain. They had a large research commission working on this question at the present moment.I also informed Group-Captain Pirie that the Hon. Louis Johnson had told me that they were building the new Boeing Flying Fortresses with 258-ft. wing span (the present ones are 151-ft. wing span), to carry 9^ tons of bombs and to be
airworthy for 18,000 miles. At present they are only producing one per month of these machines, but they are hoping to be able to fly one to England in the coming Spring as a demonstration and turn round and fly back without landing. It is thought that these machines would be of particular value should they go to war with Japan.On Tuesday, the 8th August, I had a talk to Mr. Hamish Mitchell, who had been introduced to me by the Embassy in Washington, and he brought with him Mr. Nicolas Vansittart, who is the Overseas Director for General Motors (his postal address is 3, St. James&apos;s Square, SW. 1), with the idea that Mr. Vansittart might be of help to us if we decided to set up our full purchasing commission in New York.I then had a conference with Sir Owen Chalkley and Mr. Haggard, when we went into details as to the nucleus purchasing commission and a full purchasing commission in case of war. I enclose herewith as Appendix &quot; N &quot; suggestions for the composition of the nucleus purchasing commission; the purchasing corn-mission should we be at war and America is not involved; and, finally, the full purchasing commission should we be at war and the United States is in with us.We all agreed that undoubtedly New York is the place for a purchasing commission and the Cunard Building, where the Consul-General&apos;s office is, is the most suitable location. As Appendix &quot;0&quot; (not printed) I enclose herewith Mr. Haggard&apos;s letter to me of the 9th August together with the copy letter of the same date from the Corporation controlling 25, Broadway, with their estimate of the cost and plans.As I understand that Sir Ashley Sparks will be the Shipping Controller and he has reserved space in the building for that purpose, and as I am told that the Food Controller would do his own purchasing in New York and would require housing space which could also be obtained at 25, Broadway, I do consider it of the utmost importance that all these British activities should be under one roof, as ultimately the Dollar exchange is going to be the dominating factor, and close liaison, therefore, must be kept between the different departments. I would call your attention to the fact that we shall be throwing a considerable burden on the Commercial Counsellor in Washington and it would be very necessary to give him an assistant.I am not overlooking the fact that it may be found desirable that some of the raw materials which the Board of Trade will purchase should be purchased through normal channels. There will still be the questions of shipment and transport and sometimes inspection, and I do think it is important that all inspection should be controlled and organised from this same centre in New York.I repeat here with the greatest possible emphasis that unless we set up this nucleus purchasing commission at once the immense amount of goodwill which has been shown us in Washington will quickly fade, and it will be extremely difficult to revive, and on the maintenance of this goodwill and the development of it so much may depend on the future that any cost to which we may be put in main-taining this nucleus purchasing commission is completely insignificant compared with the benefits which it will bring us, both as regards our immediate purchases and as regards the whole question of purchases in case of war.The Hon. Louis Johnson repeated to me that, even if they were in the war, they would be prepared to share the production of their country with us, giving us something in the proportion of three out of eight units, and I again wish to emphasise that we must have a liaison officer in Washington who is persona grata, and he could visit the head men of all the departments, and this could be done by our Commercial Counsellor, who could depend for technical help on the Naval Attache, the Military Attache&apos; and the Air Attache.A few orders placed promptly through our nucleus purchasing commission after consultation with the department in Washington concerned could clinch the whole situation in the eyes of Americans and convince them that we had taken their offer seriously.Therefore, I strongly counsel that there should be no delay in putting this plan into effect.It might be advisable, in view of our decision not to incorporate our purchasing commission, to call the manager of it our Trade Commissioner, which would put him in exactly the same position as the Australian Commissioner, who purchases Australian requirements without the slightest difficulty.[19848] c
There has been no publicity whatsoever either in the United States or in Canada in regard to my mission. I have not left any of the detailed information regarding requirements given to me by the various departments with anybody at all, and I have merely used this information for the basis of my discussions.In conclusion, I wish to express my sincere thanks to Mr. Victor A. L. Mallet, the Counsellor at the Embassy, to all the members of the Staff there, and also to Mr. Gr. D. N. Haggard, the Consul-General in New York, for the unfailing help and efficient assistance which they have given to me.RIVERDALE.August 17, 1939.Itinerary.Saturday, July 22, 1939.

O. May of Price, Waterhouse and Company, New York, who leaned towards incorporation but believed that it was not absolutely necessary, but it would have advantages in case we had to sue for non-fulfilment of contract or something of this kind.Finally, after a conference with Sir Owen Chalkley and Mr. Haggard, we came to the conclusion that we need not incorporate at all and we can really carry on a purchasing commission, so long as we needed no credit, and what finally influenced us towards this definite conclusion was the fact that the Australian Trade Commissioner conducts practically all the buying for the official departments of the Government and makes payments to the United States and no difficulty has ever arisen.When discussing this question, Mr. Hamish Mitchell recommended us to some first-class lawyers, Messrs. White and Case, of 14, Wall Street, New York, N.Y., and Mr. May of Price, Waterhouse and Company also confirmed that these people were of high-class standard.

Direct Investigation.I. Budish, of the Economic Department, to whom reference was made for information, interviewed in the recent past, stated that operations continued active and were on better than a break-even basis. He reported that indebtedness continued well controlled and adequately supported by trading assets.In respect to judgments recorded against this corporation, one on the 9th April, 1938, in the amount of $6,204 by M. Lahman, et at., and another in the amount of $21,830 by the Guaranty Trust Company of New York as Assignee, both of these actions are being appealed, it is reported, and as yet no decision has been rendered.Bank Investigation.Maintains accounts with three local&quot; depositories, where aggregate balances run in a substantial figure. At one bank accommodation is extended on letters of credit, customers&apos; notes discounted, and also on a secured basis. Relations in this quarter are reported satisfactory.Trade Investigation.Since its organisation, this company has purchased substantial quantities of goods from representative domestic concerns, and periodic trade investigations have uniformly disclosed a favourable debt paying record.

Vishniakov, Acting Treasurer. No contingent liability reported.A nalysis.Comparative statements represent the individual balance sheets of Amtorg Trading Corporation. Its capital stock interest in its only subsidiary, namely, Soviet Russia Vodka Wine and Liquor Corporation, which was formed in October 1934, is represented by the Investment item of $10,000 at the 31st December,: 1935. Shortly after formation the subsidiary became inactive and the interest in this subsidiary has since been carried at no stated value.The Amtorg Trading Corporation sets primarily as an intermediate buying organization for trading entities of the U.S.S.R. It is the sole representative in North America of the various Soviet trade and industrial organizations and purchases in the United States to fill specific orders of the various import corpora-tions located in Russia numbering about twenty, each of which specializes in certain lines or types of products. Inasmuch as all foreign trade is a Government monopoly, these import corporations function as Government agencies, and each order placed with the Amtorg Trading Corporation is accompanied by a licence from the Commissariat for Foreign Trade authorizing the purchase. These licences also serve as authorities for the payment by the State Bank of Russia of the obligations incurred in the placing of the order. In effect, the licence thus issued directs the State Bank to set aside or earmark certain specific funds for the payment of each order and for no other purpose. Such a relationship is obviously of primary importance and, in view of the unusual status of the Amtorg Trading Corporation, a clear conception of its financial condition and responsibility could not be obtained solely through an analysis of its financial statements.In representing the various Soviet import corporations as purchasing agent, the Amtorg Trading Corporation makes substantial purchases in the United States for which it issues its own trade acceptances. These obligations are represented in the 31st December, 1937, balance sheet by the item Notes Payable, and consisted entirely of trade acceptances payable. The import corporations in turn issue acceptances with similar maturity characteristics to the subject company to cover the purchase and commission due the subject concern, such acceptances being represented by the item Notes Receivable. The item Accounts with Branches $313,894-42 is not segregated, but represents receivables chiefly from foreign debtors. It will be noted that these accounts at the 31st December, 1935, had a credit balance representing chiefly indebtedness against merchandise[19848] d 2
purchases. As a selling agent, the company originally handled the products of the various Soviet companies on a consignment basis only. In 1936, however, the policy was adopted of purchasing merchandise outright from the various import corporations, title passing to the subject company. Some transactions, however, continue to be executed through the consignment method and are represented on the balance sheets by the item Consigned Merchandise, against which a corres-ponding current liability has been set up.In the period from 1931 through 1933 when the low point was reached, there were steady and material decreases in the volume of business transacted by the Amtorg Trading Corporation, particularly in export, which contracted from nearly $100,000,000 in 1931 to $4,000,000 in 1933. This trend was attributed mainly to difficulties experienced in negotiating long-term credits with American manufacturers and the availability of such - accommodation in certain foreign countries. During 1933, as the result, import volume, for the first time in the history of the company was in excess of export volume, a condition which con-tinued to prevail during 1934. Over the succeeding three years, however, volume, both export and import, has increased steadily, particularly shipments from this country, which, in 1935 and 1936, once more exceeded importation. Volume figures for the year 1937 have not been made available for publication.By reason of the extremely large volume which is transacted on a relatively small investment, the financial condition of the company has been characterized by heavy indebtedness, and until the last fiscal closing Current Liabilities had consistently been well in excess of the Tangible Net Worth. However, full cognizance must be made of the manner in which the company operates and liabilities are shown to be adequately covered by the Cash and Receivables. No close&apos; estimates of the liquidity of the Receivables can be made in the absence of definite maturity dates, but foreign organizations represented are reported to have maintained an entirely satisfactory debt-paying record over a period of years.Customers&apos; Deposits represent prepayments from customers on merchandise transactions and at the 31st December, 1937, are segregated as follows : Deposits by foreign clients for merchandise to be exported from the United States, $482,097-96; and deposits by domestic customers against merchandise to be imported to the United States, $3,013-68.Amtorg Trading Corporation, Importer and Exporter.New York City, 261 Fifth Avenue,July 6, 1938.D.

Zhukhovitsky.Personnel.The officers of this company, all natives of Russia, are selected by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. They reside in the United States and devote their entire time to the interest of the subject enterprise. Frequent changes are made in the official personnel of the company. D. A. Rosoff was elected Chairman of the Board and President on the 9th March, 1937, to succeed Ivan V. Boyev, who had been President and Chairman of the Board from August 1934. D. A. Rosoff, a former head of various Soviet and foreign trade organizations, was, prior to assuming his present offices, First Vice-President of the Amtorg Trading Corporation for a period of eighteen months.V. K. Bogdan is in charge of the export department. L. G. Zhukhovitsky and A. A. Vartanian succeeded G. V. Ackerman and I. I. Gertzenberg as First Vice-President and Vice-President in January 1938.   I. A. Ilyin succeeded
B. Kalm as Treasurer in January 1938. He was formerly in the accounting department and now acts as chief accountant. S. Vishniakov has been in the finance department for some years, and for a time was acting as Treasurer until the election of I. A. Ilyin.History.Incorporated under New York laws the 27th May, 1924, with an authorized capital of $1,000,000, all common stock. On the 1st September, 1925, the authorised capital was increased to $1,500,000, and again on the 1st October, 1928, to $3,000,000 par value $100.The Amtorg Trading Corporation was created through the consolidation of the Arcos-America, Inc., incorporated under New York laws the 22nd December, 1923, and the Products Exchange Corporation, incorporated under New York laws the 24th February, 1919. Both of these concerns were controlled by Soviet interests.Originally located at 136 Liberty Street, the business was moved during 1926 to 165 Broadway. Headquarters were moved to the present address during 1930. Branches formerly maintained at Chicago, 111., and Los Angeles, Calif., were discontinued during 1932. The San Francisco branch was discontinued in 1934. Soviet Russia Vodka Wine and Liquor Corporation, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary, which handled the wine and liquor division of the subject business, had been dissolved.Method of Operation.The Amtorg Trading Corporation is the sole representative of most of the Soviet trade and industrial organizations on the&quot; North American continent by virtue of a licence granted by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Major activities of the company consist of purchasing for its clients in the U.S.S.R. and importing and selling Soviet products. In addition, the company has also acted as agents in securing the services of American engineers and labour for work in the Soviet Union, although these activities in recent years have represented only a minor phase of the business.The relative percentages of exports and imports to total volume varies con-siderably from year to year. For a number of years export volume was considerably in excess of import volume. Export volume, however, fell off sharply in 1931, and in 1933 imports for the first time in the history of the company were in excess of exports, amounting to 71 per cent, of total volume. In the past two years, however, the export volume has again exceeded by a sizable margin imports.Purchases made in the United States for exports are to fulfil orders which have been placed by various Russian import corporations, numbering about twenty. When one of these corporations wishes to place an order for the impor-tation of goods into Russia, application is made to the Commissariat for Foreign Trade of the U.S.S.R., who also issues a licence to accompany the order which serves as authority for the payment by the State Bank of the obligations incurred in the placing of the order. Under this practice payments have been made to suppliers by Amtorg in the United States before shipment of merchandise.Exports of the Amtorg Trading Corporation consist mainly of machinery and equipment used in metal working, mining construction, power plants, agricultural, chemicals and oil industries. The import volume includes agricul-tural and manufactured food products, furs, fish and fish products, lumber, textile products, minerals, art products, and a wide line of chemicals, drugs and pharmaceuticals. This diversified line of products is sold throughout the United States on terms varying according to the trade sold.A branch is maintained at Moscow, U.S.S.R.Location and Fire Hazard.Leases three entire floors and substantial space on additional floors of a modern loft and office building, maintained in an excellent state of repair, and otherwise occupied by concerns engaged in miscellaneous lines.Fire Record. Records show no fire loss.
