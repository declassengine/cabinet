(THIS,,document; IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC. MAJESTY&apos;S GOVSRIMENT)SECRETCP. 163(39)CABINET,COPY MO.-h)The Institution of a National BadgeScheme.Board of Education,I had prepared a memorandum for submission to theCabinet on future policy for the promotion of physical training and recreation in England and Wales.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer has, however, not felt able, in the short time available, to give full consideration to my proposals, and accordingly I do not ask for any decision before the Recess on the questions of policy and finance which I had raised.2.      There is, however, one matter on which I find it necessary to take the decision of my colleagues, namely, the -institution of a National Badge for physical proficiency. National Badge Schemes are in operation in a number of European countries, both democratic and totalitarian, and have been tried in certain public and other schools in this country and in America.      The need for a National Badge Scheme on a voluntary basis in this country has been urged from many quarters and I believe that the incentive to training, which it would provide, would do much to raise the standard of physical fitness, particularly in youth.      The matter has been carefully explored by a Committee of the National Fitness Council with the help of two panels of experts, and provisional schedules of tests for men and boys have been worked out.
0, iy3.      There is a special reason why I have felt bound to ask for the decision of my colleagues on this aspect of my proxjosals as a matter of urgency.      The National Badge Scheme has been examined in detail by the Army Sports Control Boards who are anxious to make the winning of the Badge the main objective of physical training in the new Militia., I understand that a Handbook for issue to Militiamen, which includes details of the Badge, is already in proof, and that its issue is being held up pending a decision on the question of principle.4.      The financial effect of the adoption of such a scheme would be very slight.     As far as the present financial year is concerned, any expenses could be met out of Subhead L.  of the Vote of my Department.      Thereafter, it is estimated that  15,000 a year would cover the cost of organising and administering the scheme.28th July. 1959. D.
