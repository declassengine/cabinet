This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, August, 1939SECRET. Copy No.4 8CP. 184 (39)THE CABINETRECRUITING FOR THE ARMY ON MOBILIZATIONMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. It is estimated that our Regular Army will require for the first four months of war 275,000 men. Except for some 40,000, chiefly tradesmen and semi-skilled labour&quot;, these numbers are available from the Regulars serving on the outbreak of war, Reservists and Supplementary Reservists.2. The establishment of the Territorial Army is 437,000: at the moment it is some 19,000 short of establishment. This shortage is largely in the ranks of tradesmen. Once it is up to establishment it will not make further substantial demands on man power, until it is sent overseas some months after the outbreak of war.3. In addition to the Regular Army and its reserves there are under training 35,000 militiamen, and there are waiting to be called up during the rest of the year a further 156,000. On the outbreak of war these militiamen will (when legislation now in draft has been passed) be available for posting to Regular or Territorial units, wherever there may be shortages, and for drafting overseas as reinforcements, when required.4. It follows from the facts given above that, except for certain tradesmen, etc., there will be no need for large numbers of recruits at the outbreak of war, and that the militia will be available for immediate reinforcements.5. It is at present contemplated that voluntary recruiting will continue on the outbreak of war until compulsory service has become effective, and that recruits will be taken at 150 centres. This system follows the lines of the recommendation of the Man Power Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence (N.S. (CM.) 29) in October, 1938, and, when it was decided on, it was thought that 300,000 recruits would be wanted in the first month. This is no longer the case, and, if a flood of recruits pours in, their training, accommodation and equipment would cause considerable embarrassment, while at the same time civil business and industry engaged on the re-armament programme might be disorganized by the withdrawal of volunteers. What is required is a machinery which will produce recruits in classes gradually as they are needed. Such a machinery already exists in part in the Military Training Act, which enables all those of 20 years of age to be called up for service and will be supplemented by the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, which the Ministry of Labour has in draft. This Act will introduce compulsory service and will enable men, who, by reason of their age, are outside the scope of the Military Training Act, to be enlisted.6. I should therefore propose that, except for special classes of tradesmen and semi-skilled labour required to meet deficiencies on the outbreak of war of a kind which the militia cannot meet, and possibly in Northern Ireland if the National Service Act does not run there, voluntary recruitment for the Army should cease on the outbreak of war; and that our recruits should be obtained iri an orderly fashion through the machinery of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act. The public should be informed of the policy by suitable broadcasts and notices. It would still, of course, be open to the Navy and the Air Force to continue voluntary recruitment.7. If my colleagues concur in my views, I would ask their authority to make preparations on the above lines and to submit to those of them immediately concerned the actual text of the announcement, which I suggest should be issued as soon as it is clear that war is inevitable.L. H.-B.The War Office,2&amp;th August, 1939.(b39/8)   70   8/39   w.o.p.   3573
