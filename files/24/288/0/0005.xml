9 9O JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1939.SECRET.CP. 155 (39).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.&quot; Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE below some brief notes on three points, referred to below, which were raised by my colleagues in Cabinet this morning :  (1) Cabinet Conclusions 37 (39), Conclusion 3-United States attitude in the Tientsin question;(2) Cabinet Conclusions 37 (39), Conclusion 4 Position of British subjects in the South Tyrol;(3) Cabinet Conclusions 37 (39), Conclusion 6 Italian forces in Libya.H.July 12, 1939.(1) United States Attitude in the Tientsin Question.At his press conference on the 19th June Mr. Cordell Hull said that, while the United States Government were not concerned in the question of the four Chinese at Tientsin accused of anti-Japanese activities, they were &quot; concerned with the nature and significance of subsequent developments in their broader aspects, coupled with other past and present acts and utterances in other parts of China.&quot; The same day Mr. Hull informed Sir R. Lindsay that he was working carefully and with deliberation on a broad statement on developments in the Far East. He admitted that the statement might take the form of repre-sentations at Tokyo. A few days later, in response to enquiries from Sir R. LindsaVj the Under-Secretary said that the statement was likely to cover ail issues, both political and economic : it would be lengthy and &apos;&apos; probably severe, in tone.&quot; The date of issue, which might not be &quot; just yet awhile,&quot; would be chosen with a view to producing the maximum effect in the Far East. On the 28th June the Under-Secretary was still unable to say when the statement was likely to be issued. Since then we have heard no more from Sir R. Lindsay, who, no doubt, hesitates to give an impression of importunity in pressing for further information as to the statement&apos;s contents, form or date of release.Copy No. gg(2) Position of British Subjects in the South Tyrol.On the 10th July the Prefect of Bolzano issued an order cancelling permits for foreigners to reside in the Province of Bolzano. This measure is not, strictly speaking, an order of expulsion and the foreigners concerned will presumably be allowed to move to other parts of Italy, if they desire to do so. It applies to all foreigners and the Consul-General at Milan estimates that about 200 persons established in Bolzano wall be affected, of whom about fifteen are British subjects.10467   [19R381
Tourists are required to leave the Province within forty-eight hours; the cases of foreigners established there will be examined individually and on their merits; the prefect has already been instructed to allow them a reasonable time within which to depart; this applies particularly in the case of invalids or persons undergoing medical treatment.It is not yet certain whether the ban will be temporary or permanent, and, consequently, whether it will actually be necessary for foreigners established in the Province to liquidate their affairs.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome has already discussed the question with the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the absence in Spain of Count Ciano, and has expressly reserved the rights of British subjects. He has drawn attention to the question of the transfer abroad of the proceeds of any liquidations that may be made necessary by this measure. Signor Bastianini said that he had not considered this question and imagined that it might be done through the Clearing.(The Anglo-Italian Clearing Office state that, if these monies were to await transfer in the ordinary way, it would be a very long time before the sterling would be in the hands of the British subjects; it probably would not be difficult to arrange for the transfer of small sums in cases of real hardship, but that if all the persons affected by this measure were to be given priority it might seriously affect the position of other British subjects who are trying to get money out of Italy, because there is only a very limited amount of sterling available; incidentally, Treasury sanction would be required.)Sir P. Loraine also drew attention to the fact that some British subjects established in the South Tyrol might not at the moment have any representatives on the spot to look after their interests and he asked for the good offices of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in minimising the inconvenience to British subjects. Signor Bastianini said that he was already alive to this.Sir P. Loraine has arranged that the Acting Consul-General at Milan shall be able to communicate direct with the Prefect of Bolzano on this question.The measure is stated to be due to military and political considerations and Signor Bastianini seems to have admitted that it was connected with the reported arrangement between Germany and Italy for the settlement of the minority problem in the South Tyrol. We have, as yet, no precise information as to the nature of that arrangement. The idea behind the present measure is clearly to remove from the South Tyrol all foreigners who might be in a position to send home too accurate reports of the methods used by the local authorities to transfer the local German-speaking population.Whether or not we have any treaty grounds for protest, it appears unlikely that we should gain anything by entering one; it would always be open to the Italians to expel the British subjects concerned, which they are certainly entitled to do.The measure apparently applies indiscriminately to all foreigners, though the Germans will, presumably, come under a separate arrangement, compelling them to return forthwith to Germany. Of other nationalities, the Swiss will be principally affected.(3) Italian Forces in Libya.The present strength of the Italian forces in Libya is 74,000 metropolitan and 15,000 native troops. The metropolitan troops have recently been reduced to this figure by the return of 6,000 older reservists to Italy. The normal strength of the Italian troops in Libya is approximately 40,000 metropolitan and 15,000 native troops. The War Office are confident that the Egyptian and Turkish estimates of Italian strength in Libya are greatly exaggerated. Information received by the War Office and ourselves is that there are no German troops at present in Libya. The report from Rome in to-day&apos;s Daily Telegraph that the &quot; Westfalen &quot; infantry division of German troops is at present in Libya is incorrect, as this division (or at least part of it) is at present stationed at Juterborg near Berlin.The Foreign Office have no confirmation of the report (mentioned this morning) that there is a concentration of German troops on the Brenner.
