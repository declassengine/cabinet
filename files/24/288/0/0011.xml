DEPRESSED AREAS COMMITTEE.Note by the Prime Minister.1. The Depressed Areas Committee of the Cabinet, at ameeting on the 10th November last,  decided that as an interim measure the Special Areas Acts should, &quot;be continued for another year by means of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill;    and that something should be done to meet the claim that the Government should no longer confine assistance to the Special Areas as. scheduled in the 1934 Special Areas Act hut should assist the development of new industries in areas of heavy unemployment, whether in or outside the technical Special Areas.      One of the methods which has proved of greatest value in the development of industry in the Special Areas has been the provision of loan facilities for the establishment of new industries,  and the Committee accordingly decided that it would be desirable to introduce legislation to provide such facilities in areas of heavy unemployment to he defined not &quot;by a geographical schedule hut &quot;by a series of conditions.2, In all the circumstances it hardly seemed necessarylast November to report the decision to the Cabinet, hut action was taken to include the Special Areas Acts for one year in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill and the Minister of Labour announced the Government&apos;s intention of introducing legislation at an early date to provide loan facilities..3. There has been some delay in reaching agreement onthe terms of the proposed Bill and some pressure in Parliament for its introductionc      The Chancellor of the Exchequer-1-
announced on the 11th July that the Bill was in course of preparation and he hoped- that it might he possible to introduce it &quot;before the House rose for the summer recess.     He added that it was impossible for him at that stage to give any guarantee as to its subsequent progress, but in reply to a supplementary question he said that if there was general agreement he hoped that it would be possible to carry the measure before the end of the Session.4. Since the Cabinet Committee considered the matter last november,  the unemployment position has, of course, undergone a complete change, and if we were considering the matter entirely on its merits alone at the present time, without regard to past pledges, it is doubtful whether such, legislation would &quot;be justified.      In view, however, of the pledges given it is clear that we must introduce the Bill at the earliest possible date.5. The Cabinet Committee has not had time to meet and consider the actual terms of the Bill, but it has approved the joint proposals by the Minister of Labour and the Secretary of State for Scotland on which the Bill, of which a copy is attached, is founded.6. It will he noted that the main provisions of the bill are as follows:-(i) The Treasury to be empowered up to March 1942 to agree to make loans to new undertakings to he established in areas of heavy unemployment.      The total sum to be available is not specified but there is a limit of  200,000 for any one loan.(ii) Loans are only to be made for industries established in areas of heavy unemployment which are defined in Clause 1 of the Bill.      It will be noted that the Bill deliberately makes no reference at all to the Special Areas nor would the definition of &quot;areas&quot; include large cities such as Glasgow or Liverpool.
(ill) In order that the Government may be assured thatapplications have local support and are not likely to conflict with existing industries in the areas, it is provided that the initiative shall rest with a Local Development Council which will he required to introduce the industry to a small Advisory Committee, appointed hy the Treasury; if it thinks the application merits consideration, the Committee will ascertain from the Ministry of Labour whether the area   proposed falls within the definition of an area of heavy unemployment in the Bill.      If so, the Advisory Committee will examine the merits of the application from an industrial and financial standpoint.     The Treasury will not be empowered to make any loan except upon the advice of this Committee.It is accordingly recommended that -(i) subject to consideration and approval by the Home Affairs Committee, the Bill should be introduced before the House rises for the. summer recess;(ii) the Government should attempt to get the Bill passed during the current Session.(Intd.)
