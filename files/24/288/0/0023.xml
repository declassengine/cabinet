(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.CP.NO.  173/39.cabinet india.Appreciation of the Political Situation., by the Government of India, dated 17th July, 1939.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of state for India.
1 a ?-A O QConfidential appreciation of the Political situation in India,5 dated the 17th July, 1939,  issued on the authority of the Secretary&quot; of. state for India.1;.    Indian States. Nothing more has been heard of Rajkot during the last month:; Congress agitation in other States has died down in obedience to Gandhi&apos;s orders, and the centre of interest has shifted to the Arya Sairtaj - Hindu Mahasabha campaign against Hyderabad. As was stated in the last Appreciation, this agitation is having a bad effect on relations between the communities. This was the reason given for an order published by the Madras Government in the middle of June- prohibiting the holding of meetings in the city of Madras in connection with the Hyderabad agitation, and this Government also proscribed certain pamphlets about Hyderabad calculated to embitter communal relations.    On the other hand the prohibitory order issued by the Bombay Government regarding Sholapur was modified about the same time;  satyagraha volunteers have been permitted to return to the district but not into the city of Sholapur.    There has been no further trouble there.    The Central provinces Government went only so far as to sanction the prosecution of two Arya samajist agitators.    A communique was issued by the Punjab Government in the last week in June pointing out that attacks were being made from within the    province against various States - Hyderabad, patiala, Bikaner, -Bahawalpur etc. - ; that the Punjab Government was aware of its responsibility to save States from such organised attacks, and also that this agitation was endangering the peace of the Province by embittering communal feelings; therefore certain provisions of the Indian States (Protection) Act were being enforced throughout the
Province for a period of one year, whereby magistrates may prohibit meetings in furtherance of a design to send volunteers into states.    The enforcement of this Act is the most- effective method available of preventing this form of agitations no Congress Government has yet seen its way to use it; how vigorously the Punjab Government intend to enforce it in practice remains to be seen.    That Muslim feeling is becoming more and more disturbed is shown by reports of threatened Muslim reprisals to counteract the activities of the Arya samajists.    The working committee of the All-India Muslim League, meeting in Bombay early in July, condemned the Arya samaj agitation, warned every one concerned of the danger of communal trouble, and urged Provincial Governments and the Paramount power to take action to stop this mischief.    Meantime the agitation continues.On June 30th the Standing Committee of the All-India States1 Peoples conference (of which Jawaharlal ITehru is President)  issued an aggressive statement in which emphasis is laid on the complicity and responsibility of the Paramount power for misrule and abuses in the states.    Nevertheless the manifesto is also emphatic in deprecating premature and ill-organised civil disobedience,  and it is clear that the leaders realise how little control they can exercise in the States.    Gandhi, writing in the &quot;Earijan11 of July 8th, spoke of the demoralisation of the princes and the people of the states as one result of his suspension of civil disobedience, and reiterated that it was only natural to hold the Paramount power responsible for the &quot;unadulterated autocracy that reigns supreme in
many States&quot;.      So although there is a lull at the moment, there are signs that there nay in due course be a revival of agitation against Rulers.      Nehru has produced a constitution for the All-India States&apos; People1e conference on the Congress model and Gandhi may see in this revitalised organisation the instrument which at present he lacks; 2*      The Congress Party.      On June 21st the &quot;(forking Committee met in Bombay in preparation for the important meeting of the All-India Committee.      Gandhi and Nehru were present by invitation.      At about the same time a conference of left-wing elements was held also in Bombay;    the various groups failed to achieve any real unity but evolved a form of accommodation which may result in consolidating the forces of revolt against the Congress policy.      A Left Consolidation Committee consisting of representatives of leftist groups has been formed with Bose as President.      None of the groups however have agreed to membership of Bose&apos;s &quot;Forward Bloc&quot;. It was perhaps the Communists who achieved the greatest success, whose object of capturing Congress from inside leads them to avoid open provocation;    they succeeded in forcing the resignation of four prominent leaders from the Congress Sooialist Party,  and in securing the alliance with themselves of the Congress Socialists as they were left.      Thus the first step in the Communist plan - i.e.  the capture of the Congress Socialists as a preliminary to capturing the Congress - is well-nigh achieved.Both the right and left wings desired to avoid open conflict;    the left had not  secured sufficient unity and the right were partly afraid of left-wing strength and partly anxious to avoid anything which might give the left popular support.      Conciliation therefore became the order of the day at Bombay, though it was recognised that there was an
open breach in Congress unity.The All-India Congress Committee sat from June 24th - 27th.      Most of the amendments in the Congress constitution recommended by the sub-committee were accepted,  but for reasons given above, the orthodox leaders decided to defer till the next All-India Congress session (in December)  a contentious amendment which proposed to debar from office or membership of any elective Congress Committee members of communal or any other organisations the programme of which may be anti-national or in conflict with the programme of the Congress.      The threat to the left-wing was obvious. The&apos; reforms actually adopted in the Congress constitution are likely to have little effect.In spite of the desire for conciliation the All-India Congress Committee meeting led to open hostilities over certain resolutions;     Resolutions viewing with concern the position of Indians in South Africa and Ceylon (in the latter case authorising Jawaharlal Nehru to visit the island to effect a settlement),  and one about the Digboi strike (see below) had a fairly easy passage.      Some opposition was expressed to another resolution that in administrative matters a Provincial Congress Committee should not interfere with the discretion of a Ministry!    but the real fight came over a resolution to the effect that no Congressman may offer or organise civil disobedience without the previous sanction of the Provincial Congress Committee concerned.      After a heated debate this was carried by 130 to 60 votes.      It is said that the Working Committee wished to defer this resolution also but their hands were forced by Congress Ministers who complained of undisciplined
opposition from their so-called supporters and insisted on the resolution being moved.      The resolution was strongly attacked by Subhas Bose,  the Congress Socialists,  and the Kisan leaders.To the horror of orthodox Congressmen the Left Consolidation Committee issued an appeal fox the observance of July 9th as an All-India day of protest against the last two mentioned resolutions. Eajendra Prasad, the Congress President,  condemned the proposal&apos;!    Nehru,  while admitting his dislike of the resolution on civil disobedience,  said that the proposal was dangerous and tended to undermine essential discipline;    and the All-India Congress Committee issued a circular warning all Congress Committees that they must not question the authority of the All-India Congress Committee.      The day of protest was,  however, held;    meetings are said to have been poorly attended;    the most significant point is that the Bengal Provincial Committee supported the Left Committee in opposing the All-India Congress Committee decisions.In the struggle for power the right-wing are at present victorious, but that the atmosphere  in Bombay was charged with hostility and revolt was appreciated by the right-wing leaders.      Bose&apos;s invitation to insubordination since the Bombay meeting can only have widened the breach.      It is not known yet whether any disciplinary action is proposed against Congressmen who took part in the protest day.. &quot; It should be added that not all the Left-wing elements are agreed on the advisability of defying orthodox control.
16.Gandhi continues to write of the general state of Congress in terms of despair and foreboding.      In his article in the &quot;Harijan&quot; of July 8th his theme was that any mass agitation must become violent,  discredit Congress and ruin its cause.      The article seems to suggest that Gandhi is gravely apprehensive of the growth of extremist influence.Also at the end of June a conference of Congress Premiers was held in Bombay.      It appears to have achieved very little:    for one reason because it was crowded with Parliamentary Secretaries in attendance on the Premiers and discussion was interminable;    a communique issued about its work stated only that it was generally agreed that strong measures should be taken to prevent the spreading of communal poison by taking action against the Press.3. The Muslim League.      Bombay was also the venue ofWorking Committee of the Muslim League at the beginning of July.      Its resolution regarding HyderabadState has been mentioned.      The Committee expressed its opinion on the British Governments proposals regarding Palestine-.      It said that they are most unsatisfactory and totally unacceptable;    urged the British Government to meet the Arab demands;    and resolved to open a Palestine fund for the relief of the  dependants of those who lost their lives or suffered in the struggle for independence.4. Provincial Affairs, Assam.      The negotiations between the Congress High Command and the Oil Company concerning the strike at Digboi proved fruitless.      The All-India Congress Committee resolution passed at Bombay was surprisingly aggressive in view of Rajendra Praead&apos;s conciliatory attitude during the negotiations,
but the strong words used probably indicated a desire to propitiate the left rather than an intention to proceed to strong action.      The resolution expressed sympathy with the strikers,  condemned the Oil Company for its obstinacy,    and advised the Assam Government to legislate to make acceptance of decisions of a conciliation board obligatory,  and to threaten the Company with the cessation of its lease on its termination. In the meanwhile the situation at Digboi is fairly satisfactory.      An official resolution of July 9th states that the Assam Government has decided to refer certain matters arising out of the strike to an enquiry committee.Bengal.      Attention has once again been drawn to the &quot;political prisoners&quot; problem.     Numerous prisoners have been released on the recommendation of the advisory committee (see paragraph 3 of Appreciation No,  1 of 1939)  and only about 100 remain in jail.      The two Congress members of the committee resigned in May because,  so they declared,  their approach to the problem differed fundamentally from that of most ol the other members,  and Gandhi commenting in June on their resignations  said that there was no danger of the revival of terrorism and all &quot;political prisoners&quot; ought to have been released by now.      He did however counsel the prisoners to have patience and not to resort to hunger-strike.      On July 7th contrary to Gandhi&apos;s advice (reiterated after the strike was declared)  about 80 prisoners went on hunger-strike.     The Home Minister stated in the Legislature that this would destroy the atmoepher-e necessary for the continuance of the policy of releases, and Government were going to suspend
1 *y sj8.releases and direct the advisory committee to suspend consideration of cases.      On July 12th a Congress Party adjournment motion in the Bengal Assembly about the strike was rejected by 116 votes to 81.Bihar.      The klsan agitation is reported to be working up to a crisis,,  and revolutionaries are coming to the top.      Civil disobedience and disputes are widespread.Bombay.      Elaborate preparations have been made for the inauguration of the scheme of &quot;prohibition&quot; in Bombay city and suburbs,  early in August.      Subhas Bose has astonished and irritated Congress leaders by producing a statement to the Press in which while repeating his belief in &quot;prohibition&quot; he asserts that the Bombay scheme is impracticable and may lead to a financial collapse without bringing success to the scheme. He disapproved of the imposition of the property tax in order to make good the loss of revenue,  and championed the Parsis&apos;  cause.      Bose1s motive in condemning the scheme, which according to Munshi, Home Minister in Bombay, he tacitly approved when he was Congress President,  is almost certainly to win to his side the Parsis and others who are hard hit by the policy of the Bombay Government and to secure from them contributions to his war-chest.      Bose&apos;s statement has not unnaturally called forth protests from the Bombay Ministers and a stern and sorrowful rebuke from Gandhi.Central Provinces.      Two persons were killed and about a dozen or so injured in a communal riot in the Raipur district on June 26th.      The Government ha  previously issued a note regarding directions given to local officers about how to arrest the growth of
communal tension,  enjoining them to use several provisions of law previously dubbed by Congress as &quot;repressive&quot;.Madras.      The Government&apos;s new loan was almost a failure,  about half the amount required being left on the hands of the underwriters.      The Central Provinces Government&apos;s loan on the other hand was fully subscribed.      Interest has been aroused by the opening by the trustees of a well-known temple in Madura to untouchables.      Two complaints for trespass have been filed,  and the Government has published the provisions of an indemnity&quot; Bill.Sind.      In response to public request,  complaints being made that the Om Mandli&apos;s activities continued though banned,  the Sind Government have had the premises vacated and closed.United Provinces.      The Province retains its unfortunate reputation for communal unrest.      On June 19t and following days Cawnpore was once again the scene of rioting between Hindus and Muslims, during which 10 were killed and about45 injured.      The police had to open fire and British infantry were called out.The Madhe-Sahaba dispute continues.      The Shia agitation is kept up largely by volunteers from the Punjab,  and even in the North West Frontier Province the two sects are becoming aggressive.      Further attempts at negotiation have failed.      On July 6th the police had to open fire on a Shia mob in Lucknow which became violent. Two police were injured and six demonstrators.      In this Province also stricter orders have been issued about dealing with communal propagandists.The United Provinces Assembly is reported to have adopted the amendments made by the Council in the
10.Employments Tax Bill.      Negotiations between Government and the Opposition for a compromise over the important Tenancy Bill (already passed by the Assembly) went on during the last half of June,  and on July 7th the Bill was taken up by the Council;    a compromise was reached to refer the Bill to a Select Committee, which will report by August lOthu5. General.      The arrival of the rains has affordedsome relief to the distressed areas in the Punjab and elsewhere.      Floods were responsible for a railway accident in the United Provinces on June 28th in which 10 persons were killed and 21 injured. 6. Waziristan.      There is little change in thesituation.      Snipers have been active in the vicinity of Razmak and large raiding gangs assisted by local villagers are giving trouble in the vicinity of Banna. As a result it has been found necessary to place some of the tribal territory adjoining the Bannu district under air proscription.      The Faqir of Ipi is residing close to the Indo-Afghan border and apart from encouraging minor hostilities appears to be inactive.
