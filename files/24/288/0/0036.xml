(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT) SECRETCP.  167 (39)* COPY NO.    SOCABINET. COMPENSATION (DEFENCE) BILL.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. The draft of this Bill is attached, and I ask for cabinet authority to present it, if the emergency continues, at the appropriate moment.2* ,       The Cabinet is aware that our plans for emergency legislation had been made on the assumption that a Bill such as this would be introduced immediately after the outbreak of war, or at any rate not before it was certain that we were on the eve of such an outbreak.     As things have turned out, it has been necessary to vary this plan in a number of instances and get the emergency legislation before war is certain.     Unless the emergency very quickly Paisses away this will also be necessary in the case of the &quot;present Bill, but the right moment for presenting it is a difficult matter which must be determined in consultation with the Chief Whip.3. The present position about the compensation forproperty taken in the exercise of emergency powers is as follows.The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, which was passed through all its stages on Thursday, August 24th, authorised the making of Defence Regulations for the taking of possession of any property and for the acquisition, on
9 n o  ^ fjbehalf of His Majesty, of any property other than land. Under this authority Defence Regulation No. 51 authorises ua competent authority&quot; to take possession of land and Defence Regulation No. 53 similarly authorises the requisition of property other than land,.including, for example, a British ship.     But the Defence Regulations do not provide how the owners of property thus taken or requisitioned are to be paid.      This is to be provided in the Compensation (Defence) Bill which I am putting before my colleagues.     The Bill is really an essential part of the scheme for requisitioning in an emergency, and until the Bill is law there is no general code regulating the standard of payment or providing how the figures of compensation are to be arrived at.      It is important to fill this gap as soon as pqssible, for in the meantime a good deal of requisitioning of houses, ships, etc. is going on and without the enactment of a definite code, and the setting up of tribunals to apply it,  there is bound to be anxiety and uncertainty on the side of the owners of property requisitioned and the possibility of extravagant ad hoc arrangements on the side of the Crown.4. The Bill is the result of very lengthy and careful examination of the whole subject and appears to me to set up a reasonable measure of value.     As regards land, I call attention to Section 2 (l) (a) and especially to the proviso at the end of Sub-section (l) enacting that &quot;no account shall be taken of any appreciation of values due to the emergency&quot;.      Clause 4 contains provisions for compensation in respect of requisition of ships, vehicles and aircraft, and I understand that, subject to one or two points, the
Departments immediately affected are.in agreement with these provisions.     Clause 5 deals with the requisition of freight space and Clause 6 with compensation in respect of goods other than vessels, vehicles and aircraft. Clause 8 provides for the constitution of two tribunals, one a Shipping tribunal and the other a General tribunal.5. After the last war there was a great deal oflitigation as to the proper measure of compensation and some decisions under the previous Defence of the Realm Regulations resulted in extravagantly high payments having to be made.    It is most d.desirable therefore to get this awkward and technical topic settled by a comprehensive Bill, which, however, is only Likely to get rapidly through the House if it is produced when members feel under the pressure of actual emergency.6. I ask the Cabinet, therefore, to authorise the presentation of the Bill at the most appropriate moment for securing its rapid passage into law,(initialled)   J.
