THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1939.SECRET.Copy No.C;P. 157 (39).CABINET.FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FOR TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE the accompanying letter from our Ambassador in Angora for information only at this stage. The letter is a commentary upon the instruc-tions which I sent him in my telegram No. 255* of the 29th June about the degree of financial and economic assistance which His Majesty&apos;s Government could give to the Turkish Government. No action, or at any rate no action about which 1 need trouble my colleagues as a whole, is necessary until the Turkish Government have replied to the Ambassador&apos;s communication. But the letter is so important as a background, not merely to future reports from the Ambassador, but to Anglo-Turkish relations as a whole, that I think my colleagues ought to see it at once.My only comment is that I hope my colleagues will not be unwilling to entertain seriously the possibility of legislation making compulsory the use of a certain admixture of Turkish tobacco in all tobacco sold in this country, if further investigation shows this to be possible, and, in fact, to be the only practicable means of achieving ends that in the national interest must be adjudged vital.Your telegram No. 255 of the 29th June about financial and economic discus-sions with Turkey arrived on the morning of the 30th June and I saw Saracoglu this morning.2. I must confess that I am a good deal worried as to the Turkish reactions to what has to be said to them. For instance, to say in so many words that &quot;with the best will in the world we do not see how we can help &quot; and to suggest that they had better consult the Soviets might produce a very damaging effect. Actually, I have put all this to Saracoglu verbally and, as far as he is concerned, he received it all quite well. But it remains to be seen how it all reacts on the Cabinet here as a whole.3. I hope I am right in taking paragraph 12 of your telegram as indicating that there is still a loophole and that your decision that nothing can be done is not final. If it is, I am afraid the effect here will be very bad so bad that it will pay us to go to great lengths to avoid it.   However, I am encouraged to see some-* The text forms an Annex to this paper.

thing constructive in the hint that if the Turks can put up any useful suggestions they will be considered, especially as the telegram goes so far as to say how the suggestions should be put forward and how they can later be examined if found at all practicable.4. On the strength of this interpretation of paragraph 12 of your telegram I asked my Commercial Secretary to prepare some suggestions as to how, in his opinion, the Turks could be helped in this difficulty. I enclose herewith a short memorandum which he has drawn up, I am also encouraged by some recent correspondence, of which copies have been sent me, showing that the possibility is being considered of meeting some of the needs of Palestine and adjacent countries in the matter of food in the event of war by using Turkish produce.5. Saracoglu was certainly disappointed. He went into a long disquisition, explaining that he was speaking personally at present, though he intended to put his ideas to the Government. The burden of &quot;his argument was that, prior to the occupation of Albania, Turkey had pursued a non-committal policy which had the disadvantage that whereas her political leanings were all towards ourselves and the Democracies, she was in economic chains to Germany. It was essential to break these chains. He reminded me of the conversation reported in Loraine&apos;s letter of the 26th January last, most confidential, to the Secretary of State. He said that the conversations which had taken place in London subsequently had dribbled away into nothingness. Now, however, the whole situation had changed, and the need for a solution was far more pressing and should be examined in the light of high policy. Turkey had thrown in her lot with the Democratic Powers. By doing so she had introduced two new factors into her position. (1) She had rendered it necessary for herself to arm on a far larger and more expensive scale. As to this, she would pay for everything out of her own resources in so far as she was able, but he would be deceiving me if he led me to suppose that she could pay for everything (I here alluded to the  10 million credit offered- in your telegram No. 255), and (2) she was now far more open to economic pressure from Germany, who could not only use such a weapon directly, but also indirectly by influencing public opinion against the present policy through depriving the producers of their normal markets. If steps could be taken to link the lira to the currencies of the free exchange countries the present dependence on Germany would be automatically reduced. He expressed himself as personally entirely in favour of this, but said that it would be essential, in order to avoid a loss of confidence, that the lira thus devalued should have a gold backing.6. I think the suggestions which the Turkish Government will put forward in answer to the points in your telegram No. 255 about alternative markets will be on these lines. He also spoke with considerable emphasis about the tobacco question.7. I know the suggestion of a gold deposit here (Saracoglu mentioned  8 millions) was turned down in your telegram No. 32 of the 20th February. But it is quite true that since then the position has changed. It seems to me essential that we should support the Turks against the German stranglehold partly for our own sake to avoid a backward wave of public opinion in Turkey against the present policy and partly because it would have an excellent effect if we could enable the Turks to show to the world that their economic dependence on Germany is, really not so complete and that they have been able to find other markets for themselves        result of devaluation.8. I can hardly exaggerate the importance which I attach to a solution of this difficulty. Where it was a matter of the negotiation of war trade agreements with a neutral Turkey we seemed to have been perfectly ready to compensate Turkey in the event of her suffering by restricting her commerce with Germany (see Foreign Office Despatch No. 31, Secret, of the 19th January, and enclosures, one of which shows that we. contemplated (a) guaranteeing to Turkey supplies of all commodities of which she would stand in need, in so far as these could be supplied from allied sources, (b) purchasing agreed quantities of Turkey&apos;s staple exports, and (c) purchasing the exportable surplus of certain commodities (see P. 222 of the last enclosure in that despatch, headed &quot; Conclusion&quot;).*   9. v If so much could be, contemplated in the interests of economic warfare, surely a fortiori at least as much should be done for an ally in war.
- 10. However, I really only- want to give you, unofficially, an idea of how the thing stands here, what I expect to be the next move from this side and my own views as to the vital importance of doing all we can. I am sure it would be cheaper and wiser in the long run to give this support. I feel this not only from the point of view of Turkish economic welfare but from the wider political: aspect. It seems tome that the only solution of our difficulties in this corner of the world is to make the Anglo-Turkish combination very strong, very active and therefore very attractive. I hope you will forgive me for being so insistent about it:: But to my mind the only remaining chance of bucking up Yugoslavia and Roumania and of attracting Bulgaria is to show the immense strength of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish combination. It would be worth a very considerable sacrifice to achieve this, not to mention the importance to us on a long-range (post-war, so to speak) view of building up a solid and lasting understanding with this country.Yours ever,HUGHE KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN.Wlinute.Consideration of Foreign Office telegram No. 255 of the 29th June leaves me with considerable apprehension of the possible reactions of the Turkish Government to the declared inability of His Majesty&apos;s Government to assist Turkey in the economic field should Germany cease to be the principal purchaser of her products.2. I cannot help thinking that Turkey sees more in the Anglo-Turkish Declaration than mutual military assistance against Totalitarian aggression. She sees in it a means of escape from economic and, possibly, political servitude to a country whose good intentions she distrusts fundamentally, and she looks to Great Britain, with whom her political ideas are identical, to assist her in her aims. The Turks, I am sure, are taking the long view of the association with Great Britain, and our failure to assist her in the economic, as opposed to the purely political and military, field will cause her the keenest disappointment, and may even be instrumental in causing her to review, or at least modify, her present declared policy.3. The German Ambassador is reported to have made great play with economic questions when endeavouring to show Turkey the error of her Ways in hitching her wagon to the democratic star and Great Britain in particular. He has offered, so I am informed, to supply all Turkish military requirements on most favourable terms, and also to increase German purchases of Turkish products. The one is, in fact, a corollary of the other. The Turks are reported to have repulsed his advances, but how long they may continue to do so, in view of the declared inability of His Majesty&apos;s Government to assist, is doubtful. In any case His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision, as announced in the above telegram, cannot but cause the keenest disappointment in Turkey..4. To offer, or suggest, the U.S.S.R. as an outlet for Turkish commodities and a source of her requirements is a poor alternative because Turkish-U.S.S.R. exchanges under past favourable conditions have been strictly limited, even when bolstered with commercial credits. I do not anticipate that the U.S.S.R. could, in fact, absorb much more Turkish produce than she does at present. The U.S.S.R. Government have been at no pains to hide their keenness&apos; to secure and maintain friendly relations with Turkey and would have most certainly increased their commercial exchanges with this country had it been in the realms of practical politics. To force Turkey in the direction of the U.S.S.R. might also be inadvisable politically, as, combined, they would at some future date be able to make things generally rather difficult for us in the Near and Middle East. For these reasons I feel that the United Kingdom must make some effort to absorb further quantities of Turkish produce.5.   Should Turkey remain under totalitarian economic influences it may well become impossible for her to service-the United Kingdom loans which are [19660] b 2
suggested and which have already been granted to her. Her free exchange capabilities must be increased if the servicing of these credits is to become possible. Her exports of minerals to free markets may be sufficient&quot; as long as the present demand lasts, but a detente in the present unfavourable political situation may well cause the bottom to drop out of the mineral market and our present security would become largely valueless. Greater purchases of her com-modities, however, would increase her holdings of free exchange and the security for credits granted.6. It appears to me that there are several means by which the United Kingdom could increase her purchases .of Turkish products during the present year. The first, and one of the most important, is the question of sultanas. The Turkish crop promises well. The Australian crop has proved very short. Whereas Australia placed some 40,000 tens of sultanas on the United Kingdom market during 1938, she will not be able to place more than 16,000-18,000 tons during the present year.   The deficit might well be made up from Turkey.7. The United Kingdom purchases of Turkish sultanas over the last three years show a sharp and continuous decline. For instance, during 1936 United Kingdom purchases of Turkish sultanas were approximately 8,000 tons. This figure dropped to some 3,800 tons during 1937 and to 1,300 tons during 1938. The shortage of the Australian crop should facilitate the purchase of Turkish sultanas this year.8. Tobacco. This hardy perennial should present one of the easiest solutions of our economic troubles in the southern Balkans. Efforts are being made to encourage the consumption of oriental tobacco in the United Kingdom, but, short of (a) legislation, (b) a considerable expenditure on popularising oriental tobacco, or (c) Government purchases for issue to the armed forces as a ration mixed in a certain proportion with Virginian types there seems no issue from the present impasse. The latter suggestion has much to commend it either as a direct issue or as a means of placing large armed forces&apos; contracts with any enterprise, official or private, using oriental tobacco in the cigarettes manufactured by them.9. Wheat, barley, wool, mohair, nuts and, on a smaller scale, cotton, skins and fruit are all Turkish commodities which could find a place on the United Kingdom market.10. Totalitarian prices are such, however, that United Kingdom merchants refuse to pay a premium of 40 per cent, or more for Turkish products.11. There is no doubt that, in terms of sterling and the dollar, Turkish currency is considerable over-valued. The present rate of approximately 600 piastres per pound sterling is entirely fictitious, so much so that even the Central Bank of Turkey is purchasing sterling cheques at 895 piastres per pound and other foreign currencies at a corresponding rate. The Bank thereby competes with the &quot; Black &quot; market, which in this case, as in most others, reflects the true commercial value of a nation&apos;s currency.12. Some few months ago the Turkish Government threw out feelers to see whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would back Turkish currency by a sterling loan of gold, on which to base their new rates. A sum of 8 million sterling was suggested as sufficient, and the idea received the full support of the then Ambassador. It was not found practicable to accede to the Turkish Governments request, however, and the matter was dropped, officially. Not so, however, in commercial circles, where there is a continuous talk of devaluation, for eventual devaluation it must be if Turkey is to place her products on markets other than totalitarian. For instance, Smyrna raisin exporters are making calculations at 900 piastres for sterling in respect of the next export season, and the financial press in Turkey advises a correlation of democratic and Turkish currencies.13. I venture to suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government should reconsider their decision in this respect, and subject to the Turkish Government fixing the sterling-lira rate at, say, 900, and most important maintaining the R.M. value at its present level, which in fact would mean that sterling would no longer be at a premium in comparison with the R.M. on the Turkish market, should encourage the Turkish Government to stabilize their money on sterling around the rate suggested.
14. The gold deposited in Turkey, for such, in fact, it would be, could be extremely useful in case of hostilities, when it could be used for the purchase of supplies in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea areas. Experience has shown that gold has a much greater purchasing power than promissory notes Or script of any kind during a war period.15. By conforming to this suggestion, His Majesty&apos;s Government could well kill two birds with one stone, i.e., (i) secure an economic rate for Anglo-Turkish Commercial exchanges and (ii) create a stock of gold in a vital area in case of hostilities, and above all it would show the Turks that we were prepared to help them in their desire to side with democratic, rather than totalitarian economic influence.16. The suggestions put forward above regarding the stabilisation of Turkish currency would have the effect of cheapening all Turkish commodities for free exchange countries and of making them no more expensive for totalitarian States. The exporter would receive no less money in Turkish currency for his exports and the illusionary wealth at present existing in Turkey would be maintained. The only real drawback is that Turkey would have to produce more goods, i.e., export more commodities to maintain the servicing of her external free exchange debts. Present values in Turkey are fictitious, however, when compared with world&apos;s standards and she must be prepared to take some sacrifice to place her foreign trade on a sound commercial basis and secure her economic indepen-dence of totalitarian methods.S. R. J.June 30, 1939.Viscount Halifax to Sir H. Knatchoull-Hugessen [Angora).(No. 255.   Important.) Foreign Office, June 29, 1939.YOUR telegram No. 310 [of 23rd June], paragraph 4 : [Financial and economic questions connected with proposed Anglo-Turkish Alliance].Financial and economic suggestions made by Turkish officials during last few months have been varied and far-reaching, but I presume that questions which mainly interest Turkish Government in connexion with present negotia-tions are:  (1) Can His Majesty&apos;s Government provide a loan or further credits for improvement in peace-time, either on a long- or short-term programme, of defences of Straits and Bulgarian frontier and re-equipment of Turkish forces ?(2) Can His Majesty&apos;s Government help Turkish Government to find alterna-tive sources from which they can obtain supplies and alternative markets in which to sell Turkish goods in event -which is now looming of Germany showing her displeasure at Turkey&apos;s political policy by cutting down her trade with Turkey % (3) A fortiori, can His Majesty&apos;s Government assure Turkish Government that they could help them to find alternative sources of supply (for military and non-military goods necessary to keep Turkish forces and population going) and markets (in which they could dispose of Turkish exports to pay for these goods) in a number of different war situations, in which Turkey might be cut off from some or all of her normal suppliers and markets % (4) Failing alternative markets, what could His Majesty&apos;s Government dofinancially to enable Turkey to acquire supplies in war ? 2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful and sympathetic considera-tion to Turkey&apos;s financial needs and are, as a result, prepared to grant Turkish Government further credits for defence purposes to extent of  10 million. This money will be available when new Export Guarantee Bill is passed, probably by end of July.3. You may inform Turkish Government of this decision. Its fulfilment is naturally dependent upon conclusion of satisfactory political agreement, and it is desirable that this should be made clear to Turkish Government at outset,
even though they would be likely to take it for granted. Jt should also be emphasised that this decision has been reached despite the many calls upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, which confront them with a most serious financial problem, and despite the fact that financial assistance has already been promised to Turkey on a far greater scale than to any other country.4.   A similar communication is being made to Turkish Ambassador in London.5. Best method of expending this sum of  10 million will need careful consideration from strategic aspect. As a result of discussions with Turkish officers now in London, His Majesty&apos;s Government have formed fairly clear idea of extent to which they can supply Turkish defence requirements within next twelve or, at any rate, eighteen months without too much interference with British rearmament programme. This estimate, which includes twenty 3 - 7-inch A.A. guns, fifty &quot; Battle &quot; aircraft and.naval material for defence of Straits, comes to scarcely more than one-tenth of total Turkish demands. But this makes it all the more desirable that supply of material from this country should be determined not merely by what happens to be available (although this must inevitably be a limiting factor in all circumstances) but also by relative urgency of various Turkish requirements. His Majesty&apos;s Government hope to form clearer estimate of this aspect when list of priorities mentioned in your telegram No. B.M. 4 [of 26th June] is received.6. Meanwhile, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government find it necessary to promise General Orbay a certain amount of material without further delay. He is accordingly being given a list of items (including those mentioned in preceding paragraph) which Service Departments can, without further discussion, under-take to supply in fairly near future (i.e., up to December 1940) if orders are placed at early date. Value of these items is about  6 million and he is also being told that use of remaining  4 million must depend upon a more exact appreciation of Turkish strategical needs, undertaken in conjunction with French Government, who may be in a position to supply certain items more easily than His Majesty&apos;s Government. The supply of material is subject to same condition regarding political agreement as applies to its sale on credit.7. You may inform Turkish Government of communication which is being made to General Orbay.8. Detailed financial arrangements will have to be made with Export Credits Guarantee Department, and His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that Turkish Government should send a financial representative to London for this purpose.9. For your own information only. Although His Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish slightest hint to be given to Turkish Government at this stage that they might increase credits above  10 million, provision is, in fact, being made in new Bill for  15 million. But additional  5 million will not represent new credits. It will consist of use for armament purposes of  5 million out of  10 million industrial credits given under Guarantee Agreement of 27th May, 1938.10. This  5 million furnishes a reserve to meet further Turkish demands if these are shown to be well-founded, so long at any rate as  5 million or more of original  10 million remains unused, or used for purposes which Turkish Government are prepared to forgo for sake of securing more armaments. In this connexion it must be remembered that Turkish Government can, under Export Guarantees Act, 1939, already use at least one-third of the  10 million for arms factories, &amp;c. (though not arms), and Turkish Government already know that this is so. Turkish Government have, in fact, made enquiries for such factories of Brasserts during last few days, value of prospective orders being about  3 million to  4 million. Possibility of accepting these orders has not yet been examined, but owing to present inability of His Majesty&apos;s Government to export machine tools, acceptance may prove very difficult.11. As regards points (1), (2) and (3) in paragraph 2, question of finding alternative markets for Turkish goods if German purchases are reduced has been considered, but with best will in world His Majesty&apos;s Government do not see how they can help. In view of great difficulty of increasing imports from Turkey into the United Kingdom, even with the Mediterranean open for commercial traffic, His Majesty&apos;s Government think that Soviet Union would be country best able to replace, both as market and supplier, those countries with which Turkey
could not trade owing to unwillingness on their part or owing to war conditions. Turkish Government will doubtless wish to explore this possibility with Soviet Government direct.12. Provided, however, that their difficulties are understood from outset, you may inform Turkish Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to consider any economic suggestions which Turkish Government may put forward. They think that this should be done through diplomatic channel in first instance, and when nature of suggestions and range of subjects Avhich they involve is better known, it will be possible to consider whether oral discussions between experts on either side could usefully be initiated.13. Question of a cash loan to support Turkish currency has also been fully considered, but conclusion is that it is impossible owing to His Majesty&apos;s Governments own grave financial and exchange difficulties. You will probably think it best to avoid this topic unless Turkish Government revive it. For your own confidential information, such a loan, which will need special ad hoc legisla-tion, is being considered for Poland. But financial position of Poland is far graver than that of Turkey, and, in view of what has been and is about to be done for Turkey in other directions, I hope Turkish Government will understand that Polish loan, if it is given, can afford no precedent for themselves.
