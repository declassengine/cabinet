When the Council of the League meets at Geneva on the 8th September, it will have before it the Mandates Commission^ report, together with any observations on that report which may have been communicated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and also a report drawn up by the rapporteur in the light of the foregoing documents.3. The Mandates Commission^ report consists of its &quot;observations&quot; on the White Paper policy, and encloses the records of the Commission^ private discussions showing the individual views of its members. The Commission^ covering observations state that &apos;&apos; divergent views were found to exist&apos;&apos; among the seven members present. In this connexion it is important to note that the full membership of the Commission is eleven and that the fact that four members out of seven took a certain view need not be accepted as representing a majority decision by the Commission^* A note on the composition of the C3ommission forms Annex A.10503   [19758] b
. 4. Anyhow, of the seven members present, four &quot; did not feel able to state that the policy of the White Paper was in conformity with the mandate, any contrary conclusion appearing to them to be ruled out by the very terms of the mandate, and by the. fundamental intentions of its authors.&quot; The other three members were unable to share this opinion; &quot;they consider that existing circumstances would justify the policy of the White Paper, provided the Council didnotoppose.it.&quot; -The Commission^ observations concluded with the following [Statement:. &quot; All the members agree in thinking that the considerations put forward in the report of the Royal Commission of 1937 and in the preliminary opinion presented by the Mandates Commission in August of the same year have not lost their relevance : the solutions envisaged in these two documents (excluding the setting up of two independent States withdrawn at the outset from mandatory control) should be borne in mind at the appropriate moment.&quot;5. No decision has yet been reached with regard to any comments to be circulated by His Majesty&apos;s Government in reply to the Mandates Commission^ &quot; observations.&quot;6. The first step at Geneva during the Council Meeting will be the prepara-tion of a report by the rapporteur for submission to the Council of the League. The present rapporteur for Palestine questions is M. Munters, the Foreign Minister of Latvia, who is intelligent and well-disposed towards this country, and is therefore unlikely to adopt an unnecessarily obstructive attitude.* It is, however, not to be expected that M. Munters would be prepared to propose to the Council in this preliminary report that they should approve the White- Paper policy. M. Munters is very unlikely to be willing to take the responsibility for proposing, before the matter has even been discussed by the Council, that that body should overrule the views of the ma j ority of the Mandates Commission who were present. It is probable that M. Munters&apos;s report will be a completely non-controversial document describing briefly the situation which has arisen, summarising the Mandates Commission^ report, and any comments on the report communicated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and then saying that the rapporteur would prefer to refrain from proposing to his colleagues the text of any draft resolution on the subject before they have had an opportunity of expressing their views.  . &quot;7. Meanwhile, before any public debates take place, the United Kingdom delegation will have discussed the whole situation privately with the rapporteur, the other delegations, and the League Secretariat. The object of these private discussions will be to explore the ground, to attempt to reconcile any divergence of views among the Council members, and to ensure that the terms of any resolution finally passed by the Council shall, if possible, be satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Government. In the course of these discussions the United Kingdom delegation Will ascertain what kind of resolution is most likely to be passed unanimously  and unanimity is essential during the subsequent public discussions. It is only after these preliminary soundings have taken place that a decision can be taken on the right course of action for the United Kingdom delegation to pursue.8. There is at present no reason to suppose that any member of the Council will wish to be deliberately obstructive, or strongly to oppose His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to their Palestine policy, or that any member of the Council is likely to be either violently pro-Jewish or violently pro-Arab. Apart from the fact that members of the Council will be deluged with Jewish propa-ganda, whereas the Arab side of the case will, as usual, be almost unheard, it is possible that the question may be examined fairly impartially.9. On the other hand, there are two unfavourable factors of a general nature which will probably influence the course of events. In the first place, the Council will not be able to overlook the fact that four members of its own technical Commission, the Permanent Mandates Commission, which has examined the White Paper policy, have reported against its compatibility with the mandate. Any. resolution which the Council may eventually pass will have either to take that fact&apos;in to account, or as unobstrusively as possible record it and then set. * M. Munters will not, however, be.a member..of the Council throughout the Session. A note on.the composition of the Council forms Annex .11.
it aside. Secondly, it is perhaps unfortunate that the Council will be obliged during the same session to deal with Alexandretta, and the Mandates Com-missionV report on that question. It will-be difficult, if not impossible, for the French, if challenged, to reconcile the cession of Alexandretta to Turkey with their obligations under Article 4 of the Syrian Mandate, which provides that &quot;the mandatory shall be responsible for seeing that no part of the territory of Syria and the Lebanon is ceded or leased or in any way placed under the control of a foreign Power.&quot; The League Council will, of course, be obliged to make the best of what, from the purely legal point of view, would appear to be a flagrant breach of the mandate on the part of the French, for nothing that the Council can say or do will persuade the Turks to give back Alexandretta. The League Council, knowing that it can do nothing in the case of Alexandretta, may conceivably be tempted to take action of some kind to vindicate its authority in the case of Palestine, where the mandatory is also charged, though with far less cause, with adopting a policy which cannot legally be reconciled with the terms of the mandate.10. It is clearly impossible to foretell the exact course of events at Geneva, or to cover all the possible decisions which the Council might take. Broadly speaking, however, there seem to be about half a dozen possibilities : Contingency 1. rThe Council might simply approve the White Paper policy, without requiring any alteration in the- mandate.It will be the object of the British delegation to induce the Council to adopt some resolution on these lines. It is by no means impossible that the Council may be persuaded to agree to this course, provided that they are not asked openly to disapprove the observations of the Permanent Mandates Commission and that all due care is taken to save the face of the Commission. The resolution might be to the general effect that the Council have noted that the views expressed by four out of the seven members of the Mandates Commission present on this occasion were based, as the members of the Mandates Commission themselves were careful to point out, only on limited grounds of a technical nature, and deliberately excluded from consideration, as irrelevant, the broader political factors arising out of present conditions in Palestine; the Council, having regard to the limitations which the Mandates Commission put on themselves, appreciate the reasons given by four of them for their view; but, having taken into account, as the Council is bound to do, the wider considerations arising out of the position which has developed in Palestine, they feel that the question is one of greater difficulty and are of opinion that they can properly approve the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government without requiring any amendment of the Mandate; they therefore trust that the entry into force of this new policy will mark the beginning of a new period of peace and co-operation on the part of both the Arabs and the Jews. But while a resolution on these lines would best meet the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it may, in fact, prove impossible to secure the insertion of the words &quot; without requiring any amendment of the Mandate.&quot; Undue insistence on this phrase might lead to a demand for the reference of the question of the compatibility of the White Paper with the Mandate to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, which, for the reasons given under Contingency 4 below, would be most undesirable. The united Kingdom Delegation should therefore be ready to drop the phrase, if this proves necessary.Contingency 2.- The Council might be prepared to approve the White Paper policy, but wish at the same time to express its readiness to consider an amendment of the mandate, so that there should in future be no doubt about the legal position.This solution would leave His Majesty&apos;s Government exposed to criticism from many quarters to the effect that as they had gone outside the terms of the Mandate they had therefore broken the- Balfour Declaration. It should not therefore be accepted, if this can possibly be avoided. Furthermore, any . alteration in the mandate is bound to cause a great deal of trouble, and probably unnecessary trouble, to all concerned. The United Kingdom delegation could point this out, and press for a solution on the lines suggested under Contingency 1[19758] b 2
above. If, however, Contingency 1 were impossible, Contingency 2 would at least have the advantage of enabling His Majesty&apos;s Government to proceed with the White Paper policy.  It could therefore be accepted in the last resort.Contingency 3. The League Council, after taking note of the White Paper and the new policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, seek to pass a resolution in which   they refrain from expressing any opinion.A non-committal resolution on these lines would not be entirely satisfactory from our point of view. It would leave the whole position vague, and perhaps cause much difficulty in the future. It would be widely said that we had tried and failed to get the express approval of the League for our new policy. Many people would regard the Mandates Commission^ &quot;report as holding the field, and we should be asked if we really intended to go forward with a policy which the majority of the Mandates Commission had reported to be incompatible with the mandate, and which the League Council had failed to approve. On the other hand, in spite of these difficulties, it would seem possible to accept this solution, on the understanding that we would proceed with the White Paper policy, and that, so far as Geneva was concerned, the question of the Council&apos;s attitude towards the White Paper was settled once and for all, and that objections of principle would not be brought up at a later session.Contingency 4. There might be a strong desire among members of the Council, before finally committing themselves regarding the White Paper, to obtain a,n authoritative legal opinion, e.g., from the Permanent Court at the Hague, whether or not the new policy is in accordance with the mandate.The British delegation should strongly discourage any suggestion that a legal ruling; should be obtained, either from a speciaLxommittee of jurists, or from the Hague Court, before the White Paper policy is put into effect. Any delay of this kind would have a deplorable effect on Arab opinion in Palestine and the neighbouring Arab States. On the other hand, it will be the object:of Zionist propaganda to urge the need for a legal ruling, and thus to delay matters. It is desirable, in this connexion, that the greatest care should be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government not to over-emphasise the legal aspect of the problem; for example, it would be unwise for His Majesty&apos;s Government to challenge the Permanent Mandates Commission&apos;s &quot; observations &quot; in such a way as to become involved in a legal controversy with the Commission. The line to be taken is that there have been many changes in Palestine since 1922, that the Council has to consider the situation as it now is, and so forth.Contingency 5. The majority of the Council might be opposed to any resolution approving, or even taking note of, the White Paper, and might feel strongly that the neiv policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government ought to be amended.Since unanimity is required for any resolution, it will not be possible for the Council to pass a resolution against the British delegation^ wishes. In any case, the British delegation ought to be able to secure the support of the French, and probably some other Council members. Still, it is conceivable that the opposition among the other members of the Council might be too strong to be overcome or to be ignored altogether. In that case, the British delegation would have to point out to the Council that it was essential that there should be no delay in putting the new policy into effect, and that the members of the Council would be undertaking a very grave responsibility if, as a result of their refusal to take realities into account, the position in Palestine were to become impossible. At the worst, the British delegation would have to insist on the practical impossibility of carrying on the administration on lines which they do not themselves approve or consider to be reasonable. We must remember that any set-back for our policy at Geneva would be disastrous for our position in the -Middle East, where it would be said that we had once again weakly allowed Zionist intrigues to prevent justice being done to the Arab cause.   We would
1^annex A.THE Permanent Mandates Commission consists of ten ordinary members and one extraordinary member.   Five members now form a quorum. The seven members present at the recent meeting were :--M. P. Orts (Belgian).Baron van Asbeck (Netherlands).Mile. V. Dannevig (Norwegian).M. A. Giraud (French).Lord Hankey (British).Count de Penha Garcia (Portuguese).M. W. Rappard (Extraordinary member) (Swiss).Of these M. Orts, Mile. Dannevig, Baron van Asbeck and M. Rappard took the line that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government was inconsistent with the Mandate, and the three others the contrary view..The eighth member, M. Palacios (Spain), did not attend on this occasion.Three other members have resigned, and their places have not been filled : Mr. Sakenobe (Japan), Marquis Theodoli (Italy), Dr. Ruppel (Germany).The members of the Commission are appointed in their personal capacities and are not supposed to be in any way responsible to the Governments of the countries to which they belong.ANNEX B.THE States Members of the Council of the League are at present: Belgium, Bolivia, United Kingdom, China, Dominican Republic, France, Greece, Iran, Italy, Latvia, New Zealand, Peru, Sweden, U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia.The representative of Latvia is at present rapporteur for Mandates questions. The following States retire during the next session of the Assembly:Bolivia, China, Latvia, New Zealand, Sweden,and elections will be held to fill their places. After the election a new session of the Council is held with the new membership.   At this session it will benot, therefore, be in a position to agree to modify our policy to meet the Council&apos;s criticisms, and must stand fast, against any attempts at Geneva to induce us to do so. Fortunately, however, there seems little reason to. fear such an unfavourable attitude on the part of the Council, whose chief anxiety will probably be to avoid any such contingency as this.11. The general conclusion, after a study of the possibilities, is that the Council will almost certainly wish to avoid disapproval of the four members of the Permanent Mandates Commission who reject the White Paper as incom-patible with the Mandate, but at the same time no less strongly desire to leave His Majesty&apos;s Government free to pursue their considered policy. How these opposites are to be reconciled in an agreed resolution is a question which cannot very well be approached until just before the opening of the Council, or in any case not until the Permanent Mandates Commission^ documents and His Majesty&apos;s Governments comment on them are in the hands of the rapporteur. This will not be until about the 20th August, and it might be possible after that date to ascertain, through the League Secretariat, whether M. Munters has, after due consideration, any suggestion for promoting a solution of the problem which will commend itself to the Council as a whole.
necessary to appoint a new rapporteur for mandates questions. If, therefore, the Palestine question is carried on to the new Council, M. Munters will no longer be rapporteur.The new Members may be chosen from among the following: South Africa, China, Turkey, a member of the Scandinavian group, a member of the Baltic group and a South American State.It is most desirable that the question of Palestine should be disposed of before the changes in the Council take place.
