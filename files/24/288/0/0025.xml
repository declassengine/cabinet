17,3SECRET. CP.  175 (39) .COPY NO.CABINET.C. I.D.paper 257AOutline of the scheme of compensation for civilians in the event of injury or death resulting directly from war operations.Memorandum hy the Minister of Pensions.I submit the following memorandum for the approval ofthe Cabinet.1. Following the directions of the Cabinet of the14th December last (Cabinet 59 (38))  a scheme for the making of grants to civilians in respect of loss of life or injury from the operations of war in Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been prepared in consultation with the Departments concerned and has been agreed with the Treasury.     Regard has been had in framing it to the proposals made in a Report of a sub-committee   on this c. I.D.paper 264A.subject which were recommended &apos;as a piece of machinery&apos; by the\ JC.I.D.    Committee of Imperial Defence^ and were as such approved generally297th ^[Meeting,  by the Cabinet   on 21st October, 1937.      The modifications of those proposals necessary to meet the further points approved by theCabinet on the 14th December last have also been provided for.2. There are certain general points which I think it aswell to make clear at the outset.The scheme is a part of the general arrangementsfor the relief of war distress, and its terms are necessarily governed by the overriding consideration that theresources of the Government for compensation for injury to persons, equally with damage to property, will not be unlimited.Hence, in the first place, the scheme is one for payments on a modest scale for injury or death from acts of war in cases covered by the decisions referred to inparagraph lj    it is not a scheme for the payment of bloodi.0 money.
money.      The risks of war will &quot;be common to the whole population,  and it  is considered that,   so far as any classes of the civil community have a claim to compensation priority must be given to civil defence volunteers who are undertaking definite risks for civil defence,  and to persons engaged in work or business and all these should in the national interest, remain at work in spite of war risks.      Some other classes, however, whose claim to a grant from public funds is more remote will also be admitted to grant, but only on the basis of economic loss in consequence of war injury.      Hence there will be cases of injury or death which will not,  or may not, be eligible for payments under the scheme,  e.g0, persons of independent means,   superannuated persons^  persons drawing poor relief,  old age or other pension,  so far as they are not also earners.In the second place the scheme does not attempt to adjust the payments to the amount of economic loss sustained. The payments will be subject to fixed maximum rates, and for the most part at flat rates, however much the earnings of the person injured or killed may exceed the average, though power is taken to supplement the flat rates where there are special circumstances of need arising out of the war.The scheme is the first attempt ever made to cover the whole occupied community for injury or death due to war. As  such,   it inevitably runs up against a wide range of provisions which have been made available by statute for sickness,  injury or death in civil life,   and these do not in terms bar out injury from acts of war for the simple reason that war injuries on a Home Front were never envisaged^      To prevent an impossibly heavy charge on these civil agencies (Health Insurance, Employers liability under Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts or at Common Law, invalidity schemes, etc.) it has been necessary to relieve them wholly orsubstantially
1 Pisubstantially of their liabilities in respect of &apos;war injuries&apos; and in the case of civil defence volunteers of injuries sustained on civil defence duties,  and to provide a measure of State compensation to take their place.      The only possible measure is a flat rate system which, within the compass of a practicable State charge,   shall bear some relation to the average of the existing civil schemes.The necessary Bill to give legislative authority to the Scheme has been drafted and referred to the War Legislation Committee.I set out the salient features of the Scheme. 3. Scope of Scheme.     The scheme will apply generally to three classes of person,  namely -(a) Civilians (whether paid or unpaid) enrolled in organised civil defence services, termed in the Bill and Scheme &quot;Civil Defence Volunteers&quot;, who may be injured or killed on duty,  and their immediate dependants;(b) earners,  and persons who are normally occupied but are temporarily unemployed, who may be injured or killed as the direct result of acts of war and their immediate dependants;(c) certain classes of persons not included in (a) or (b) who have been brought into the Scheme by virtue of the Cabinet decision of 14th December last.      These consist of persons who have suffered material financial loss in consequence of war injury to themselves or to other persons on whom they were dependent for support,   andwho find themselves in consequence in straitened circumstances which they are not capable of .   . meeting
meeting by their own efforts,   e.g. children who atthe age of 15 are found to be incapable of self-support by reason of war injury suffered at an earlier age;    young persons attending school or university,  or undergoing a course of occupational training or apprenticeship, who are rendered incapable of self-support by war injury:   widows and dependent children of annuitants,   superannuated persons and pensioners killed as a result of a war injury:    unpaid household workers,  e.g., wives, whose services, owing to serious injury,  have to be replaced by engaging a paid substitute, who could not be provided without assistance. 4* Nature of injuries eligible for compensation.The scheme follows the recommendations&apos;of the Sub-Committee referred to in paragraph 1 in providing that compensation shall be confined to physical injuries. The Sub-Committee excluded particularly &quot;sickness or aggravation of sickness attributable to nervous strain, exposure,  etc.&quot;     Injury, to the brain or injury to eyesight,  as a direct result of concussion,  collapse from heart failure as a direct result of an air attack,  and similar casualties will be held as coming within the terms of the scheme.      It is clear,  however,  that if the scheme admitted claims for neurasthenic conditions or heart weakness and other ailments which may,  and will, be alleged to have resulted from air raids,  though the person so affected had not been on the scene of the explosion, they would add intolerably to the size of the bill for compensation.      In the case of neurastheniaand
and allied disorders in particular,  conferences which the Minister of Health and the Minister of Pensions have held with leading soecialists have on medical grounds fully supported their exclusion.      There may of- course, he border-line cases, but these will be better settled by agreement with the Treasury,  as they arise,  rather than by any attempt to find a formula in the scheme which would cover them,  and at the same time confine them within reasonable limits.Physical injuries to which the scheme applieswill be -(a) &quot;War injuries&quot; resulting directly from specific acts of war,  as defined &quot;in the Bill,   such as those caused by the discharge of any missile, explosive, &amp;c,  either by the enemy,  or in combating the enemy,  or from instruments of war, e.g.,  the impact of aircraft.(b) &quot;War service injuries&quot;,  i.e., physical injuriessustained by a member of a Civil defence organisation (who is certified to be such by a responsible officer of it) and which theMinister is satisfied have arisen out of and inthe course of the performance of his or her civil defence duties.      As war service injuries will include injuries resulting from accidents on duty it will be reqtiired that the Minister shallhave a report from a responsible officer regardingthe injury and the circumstances of its origin.5. Scales of grant for persons in classes (a) and (b)of -paragraph gv.Por injured persons in classes (a)&apos; and (b) of paragraph 3 there will be two kinds of. grants:-(i)    On sustaining a &quot;war injury&quot; or &quot;war serviceinjury&quot;
1 QAI U &apos;iinjury&quot; which causes incapacity for work a person in either of these classes will on making a claim he entitled to receive an initial temporary allowance for maintenance termed - &quot;Injury Allowance&apos;, which will be at a flat rate payable weekly so long as incapacity lasts.      Payments will vary only according to the number of immediate dependants (wife and children) and according as the man or woman is or is not in hospital-      Thus for a man at home under medical treatment and incapacitated and with a wife and I child the injury allowance will be 33/- a week.      In the case of a single man without dependants the payment will be 18/-.      The evidence which it is proposed to accept for the purpose of Injury Allowance is a special certificate which has been drawn up in concert with the Ministry of Health,  and the latter Department is negotiating with the medical profession for its use for all cases of war injury involving incapacity, whether the person injured is insured or uninsured under the Health Insurance Acts.      Injury allowances may continue for 6 months or exceptionally for longer periods and during the first six months of their currency will take the place of Health Insurance benefito      In order that there may be no delay in the issue of these allowances,   it is desirable that the services of a local organisation already in being should be utilised and it has been arranged that Injury Allowances shall be administered by the local officers of the Unemployment Assistance Board acting as agents of the Ministry of Pensions.
1 o rr iojAny questions of doubt or difficulty will be referred to the Ministry and cases in which the allowance has been continuously in payment for prolonged periods will,   as far as possible, be investigated by the Ministry.      The necessary instructions for the purpose are being concerted between the Ministry and the Unemployment Assistance Board, (ii)   If,  as is anticipated,  a large proportion of injuries prove to be of a minor character,  involving perhaps no more than a few weeks incapacity,  they will be adequately dealt with by the Injury Allowances. If, however,  after sufficient interval from the occurrence of the injury to enable the Ministry to determine its ultimate character,  it is found that it involves serious and prolonged disablement, further compensation will be awarded in the form of pension.      Pension will be awarded broadly on service lines,  i.e.  in accordance with the degree of disablement sustained,  without regard to the facts of employment or earnings in any particular occupation, but it is not considered necessary or justifiable to give civilians,  or even volunteers the full range of benefits provided for members of the fighting services, who are liable to be sent into action anywhere.     Thus, while the general rates of pension will be those applicable to the service casualties of non-regular Privates under the new War warrant, which will range from 32s.6d. a week for total disablement down to 6s. 6d. for 20% disablement,   it is not considered necessary to recognise disablement below 20%.     Similarly, while allowances for wives and children will be given on service scales it is not considered necessary
to grant allowances in respect of unmarried wives. Moreover an exception to the full service rates may he made to meet the case of part-time workers, whose wages are substantially below the ordinary earnings for full-time work.      Eligible women will receive pension for injury on service scales, with a maximum of 22s.6d.For death,  compensation for widows and children will also he at service rates proper to the widow and children of a private (l5/6d. a week for a childless widow under 40 and 22/6d.  a week for others,  with appropriate allowances for children) except that no provision will be made for unmarried widows and the rate for an orphan child will be 7/6d. - as provided under the Contributory Pensions Acts -instead of the higher rate of 10s.Od.  given under the proposed War Warrant. 6* Scale of payments for -persons in class (-c) of para. 5*Cases in class (c) of paragraph 3 have on the whole a less direct claim on public funds in case of injury than the claims of civil defence volunteers or earners.      Their cases will be met by way of pension or lump sum as may be found most suitable.      The amount of any pension will be determined by reference to their needs and capacity for self support.    While the pensions will in some cases be at the  flat rates appropriate to volunteers or earners this will not necessarily be the case,  though the flat rates will always be the upper limit.7. Supplementary Grants.The C.I.D. Sub-Committee referred to in paragraph 1 debated the question whether flat rates of pension,  on the.   . scale
1 p-7 l o $scale of the pension for the Private soldier, could he considered as universally adequate.     They took the view that the flat rates of compensation should he regarded as ordinarily the utmost that the Government were prepared to undertake in regard to civilian injury or death.     At the same time, they considered that some supplementation of these grants   might he necessary in exceptional cases9 though it was thought that voluntary funds would he forthcoming which might form a compassionate fund on the lines, no doubt, of the National Relief Fund of the last War.In my view, it is not practicable to place any reliance on the formation of a Central fund of this character hy voluntary contributions ands  so far as there will, be exceptional cases in v/hich the flat rates provided by the Scheme can be held to be seriously inadequates other provision must be made.The cases I have more particularly in view are those of some classes of Civil defence volunteers and earners^ e.g. those with professional qualifioations whose pre-war earnings are a good deal higher than the average and where in consequence injury or death will make a very serious difference to the normal income of the man or his widow.     It is a question whether in the interests of the Exchequer Ministers would prefer to let their ultimate intentions be known at the outset or to wait until circumstances obliged the Government to meet hard cases.     The latter course would mean an amendment to the Scheme.      Subject to this the Scheme as now drawn contains a clause empowering the Ministerj with the consent of the Treasury, to make supplementary payments by way of pension allowance or grant to any person covered by this Scheme in a case in which he is satisfied that, owing to exceptional circumstances of need arising from the War, the case cannot be adequately met apart from such provision.Administration
i n i-i 0 OAdministration of supplementary assistance should, it is proposed, he in the hands of the Ministry acting on the advice of a War Grants Committee, which might well he the Military Service (Special Allowances) Advisory Committee, recently appointed to advise on supplementary grants in cases of hardship for families of Militiamen,  Reservists and Territorials.8. Double Compensation.In framing the Scheme it has been necessary to avoid duplicating payments in respect of injuries for which compensation in some form is already, or will be, technically covered by statutory or contractual obligations on the part of employers and others.     This object has been secured in the Bill and Scheme by methods best .suited to the different types of case,  as indicated in the following three paragraphs. 9. Certain classes of person will be definitely excludedfrom the Scheme in respect of injuries compensation for which is covered by their service instruments - namely, personnel of the Civil Service so far as covered by the Injury Warrants:    members of the Naval, Military and Air Forces,  and persons employed or engaged on ships forming part of the Navy: professional firemen and professional policemen (for whom compensation in respect of injury on duty is already provided at rates exceeding those of the proposed Scheme under the Fire Brigade Pensions Act,  1925,   and the Police Pensions Act 1921):   members of the mercantile marine,  and of the pilotage and lightship services (for whom special provision is being made under a scheme framed under the Pensions (Navy, Army, Air Force and Mercantile Marine) Bill).10* In certain other cases of paid employee, benefits under the Scheme will be substituted for benefits payable under other statutory provisions; which will to this extent be modified or even abrogated under the Bill.      These are dealt with as follows:-.
10-I uThe Bill will abrogate all existing statutory and common law rights in respect of war injuries and war service injuries - this,  in particular, will have the effect of relieving employers of their obligations under the Workmen^ Compensation Acts towards employees who sustain injuries of those kinds.In doing so the Bill follows the Civil Defence Act (Section 71),   and also,  in principle,  the Injuries in War Compensation Acts,  1914 - 1915.      Employers and Insurance Companies have strongly pressed for this relief. The alternative courses would have been (a) to leave it to the choice of the injured person to pursue his claim at law or to accept the G-overnment scheme;    and (b) to leave the existing procedure to .operate without modification. The former course would simply have increased the administrative difficulties and would have placed the two sets of provisions in competition with each other to the disadvantage at some points of each, while e-ther course would certainly lead insurance companies to exclude war risks from their employer&apos;s liability policies.      In any case the extent to which compensation or damages could be awarded for war injuries is completely uncertain. The result would be to leave an intolerable,  though unknown, burden to be borne by Employers, who would be faced with the possibility of actions for damages (besides Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act claims) and would be specially difficult to justify in view of the obligations imposed on them under Section 23 of the Civil Defence Act.      In any event it has to be conceded that the risk of war injury was never contemplated in determining policy premiums for workmen&apos;s compensation or common law damages,  and,   on the principle laid down by the Chancellor that loss or injury caused by war
war to persons or property ought not to be left to lie where it happens to fall, bat should be accepted by the community as a whole,  it has been felt after prolonged discussion with all Departments concerned that the course ad.opted in the Bill is the soundest.      From such discussions as the Board of Trade have had with representatives of Insurance Companies there is good reason to believe that the provision made by the Bill will be accepted by them.(ii) Similarly,  the Ministry of Health,  in the interests of Approved Societies, and in accordance with representations from the Government Actuary have felt themselves obliged to seek a modification in cases of &quot;war injury&quot; or &quot;war service injury&quot; of the obligation to pay benefits imposed by the Health Insurance Acts,  on the ground that the finances of the insurance system do not provide for war risks.     Agreement has been reached, with that Department by which they will introduce a Bill to relieve Approved. Societies of the obligation to pay benefit in respect of incapacity for work caused by any such injury for the first six months after its occurrence,  and thereafter in cases of total disablement to limit sickness benefit to half the normal rate,  and to -withhold disablement benefit until the injured person has requalified for full benefit by the necessary periods of contribution.      This arrangement is only a slight modification of the plan laid down in the National Health Insurance Acts for men discharged disabled from service in the armed forces in the last war.(iii) It has further been arranged for the same reason that the Ministry of Health will embody in their Bill a provision relieving the Contributory Pensions Fund of the charge for Widow&apos;s Contributory Pension in cases where a widow&apos;s pension is paid under the scheme,  as is done where widow&apos;s pension is paid under Service Warrants both for -war and peace-time.11.    Employers
11.       Employers under obligation by contract or custom to paywages during periods of inability to work owing to sickness or injury.With regard to this class of case, the Bill provides in Clause 4 that an employer who, under statute,  contract or custom, would normally pay his employee a wage or other emolument during a period of sickness,  shall he relieved of his obligation in respect of &quot;war injury&quot; or &quot;war service injury&quot; except to the extent,  if any, of the difference between the amount which would normally have been paid and that paid under the scheme.      This will in particular meet the case of Local Authorities and other employers who hold certificates of exception under the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts,  and also generally of all those employers who have made arrangements of their own for sick pay. 12*       Finality of Ministry decision on Compensation.The Bill will provide in terms (Clause 1(4)) that the Minister&apos;s decision on the making, refusal or amount of a grant shall, unless varied by a subsequent decision of the Minister, be final and conclusive.      Such a provision is open to obvious political objection, but a number of appeals to the High Court on writs of certiorari or Petition of Right in cases of refusal of pension,  or as to the amount of pension, would be extremely awkward.     Parliamentary Counsel has advised that recourse to the Courts can only be barred by express enactment in the Bill.I do not anticipate difficulty from appeals with regard to the temporary Injury Allowances.      On the assumption that the system of administrative review indicated by the CI.D.  (Policy Sub-Committee) is maintained during the war period, complaints against the action of the Board&apos;s local officials in regard to injury allowances will be referred to and investigated by the Ministry.I am
*j &amp;I am much more concerned with the possible demand for appeals in regard to pensions.     It may not be possible after the war to avoid some system of independent appeal such as obtained after the last war, but during the war any such appeal.system would be unworkable because it would certainly involve the employment on the Appeal Tribunals of an army of doctors whose services would be more urgently needed elsewhere, and would require the employment of a large lay staff to prepare    the cases for the Tribunals.     Hence in regard to pensions also, during the war the administrative review would have to apply, but it would be as well to say that the Scheme to be made under the Bill will provide that in cases of serious doubt or difficulty on a medical point the Minister may (or will) refer the matter to one or more of a panel of independent medical men nominated by the Presidents of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons. This is a method which we have adopted for the last 10 years in dealing with complaints about Great War pension, and the British Legion have expressed their entire satisfaction with it and have explicitly dropped the demand for an independent Appeal Tribunal.13. Time Limit on Claims.The grant of compensation will depend on a claim being made, and for this a time limit of three months from the occurrence of the injury or from the date of first discharge from hospital will be embodied in the scheme, coupled with a discretionary power to the Minister to extend the time in exceptional circumstances.     Claims will be based on a. particular event in time, and the possibility of any verification of title must depend largely on evidence v/hich will only be obtainable at a fairly proximate date to the occurrence,     The Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act allows six months, but as a preliminary, notice must begiven
1 fil V)e.&apos; rjgiven as quickly as possible after the injury.      It is not practicable to require immediate notice to be given of air raid injuries, nor on the other hand is it desirable to encourage claims for injuries whose effects may prove to be very short lived.      It is,  therefore,  considered that a reasonable limit of time should be allowed and that three months should normally be sufficient. 14. Medical and Surgical Treatment.Under present arrangements the cost of all treatment in civil hospitals for civilians suffering from war injury will be met during the war by the Ministry of Health, as also will the cost of the treatment given in first aid posts or casualty stations.      Facilities will also,  it is understood, be provided by that Department for out-patient treatment at clinics or casualty stations.     A residue of cases will no doubt require treatment at home,   e.g.  if on discharge from hospital they are unable to attend an out-patient centre,  and it is understood the Ministry of Health are considering what extension of existing arrangements may be necessary in order to meet such cases.      This provision should cover all cases of treatment during the war.      It is not proposed in the scheme as at present drafted to embody specific provision for defraying the cost of treatment after the war to a person who is drawing civilian compensation.      Such provision,  if any,  as may be found necessary for treatment after the war period so as to relieve local authorities or the individual can at any time be made by amendment of the scheme on the termination of responsibility by the Ministry of Health.Similarly,   it is not proposed in this scheme to provide specifically any additional, allowance to a person in receipt of pension during any period of hospital treatment during or after the war.      The scheme will provide power to vary the compensation from time to time according to theassessed
assessed condition of the case, and when application is made hy a person again admitted to hospital after the award of compensation it will he possible to deal with the case by raising the rate of compensation to the maximum, if necessary, on the lines of the proposed Service War Warrant. 15. Cost of Compensation Scheme.No estimate of the cost involved by this Scheme can be given with any approach to precision.      The C.I.D.xC.I.D. Sub-Committee^ report55 of 1937 before referred to adoptedpaper257A. with some hesitation an estimate of  19 millions for thefirst year&apos;s working of its own proposals. But estimates of the casualties likely to result from air bombardment inthis country have been and must still be subject to constant readjustment in proportion as the various factors involved on each side of the account, that is of attack and defence, change relatively to each other.      While it can be said that the Air Ministry&apos;s most recent estimate puts the casualties per day at a lower figure than in 1937, the present Scheme of compensation is substantially wider in scope and terms than the earlier proposals of the Sub-Committee.      Taking all factors into account,  and assuming that air attack on the civil population forms a material element in the strategy of the next war, I do not think I can safely put the cost for the first year at much less than  30 millions.W.W.Minister of Pensions.17th August, 1939.
