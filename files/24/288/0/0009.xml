THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. COPY NO. -CP.  159(39); - -CABINET. SAFETY IN MINES LEGISLATION. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.In accordance with a decision taken by the Cabinet on the 1st February Cabinet 3(39), Conclusion 9J7, the then Secretary for Mines, on the same day, made the following statement in the House of Commons on the Report of the Royal Commission on Safety in Mines&quot;The Government accept the Report in its general sense and purport and will commence immediately to take thenecessary steps towards implementing it .....    I am afraid it is not possible to have it (the Bill) ready for introduction this session.&quot; Although the Bill has not been definitely promised for next session, there is a general expectation in the industry, both on the part of the owners and the men, that it will be introduced next session.      If this expectation is not fulfilled there will inevitably be severe criticism both from the Mine Workers&apos; Federation and the miners&apos; M.Ps, especially in view of the continued heavy accident rate*      In fact, the Secretary of Mines has this week received a deputation from the Mine Workers&apos; Federation, who pressed strongly for the early introduction of the Bill.It is not expected that the Second Reading would be opposed; but, owing to the Bill&apos;s size and technical nature, the committee stage must necessarily take a considerable time.      It is at that stage that questions on which there is a division of opinion will have to be discussed and decided;    and in order to secure its passage, it would therefore be necessary for the Bill to be introduced quite early in the new session.
fj 0The position at present is that the departmental work preliminary to a first draft of the Bill had been completed, and instructions for Parliamentary Counsel have been drawn up;   but Parliamentary Counsel, as my   colleagues know, are at present working under exceptionally heavy pressure on emergency legislation, and it has not been possible for them to commence work on the Bill*I ask therefore that authority may be given for the drafting of the Safety in Mines Bill to be undertaken by the Parliamentary draftsmen when they have disposed of emergency legislation, and after the holidays, with a view to its consideration by the Home Affairs Committee.This authority is not sought in order to gain any special priority for the Bill, but solely in order that the necessarily lengthy drafting work may be completed and the Bill ready for introduction early in the new session, should the Cabinet desire to include Safety in Mines legislation in the Eing&apos;s Speech.0.
