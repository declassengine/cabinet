THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. 48COPY NO.CP.154(59).CABINET. MERCHANDISE MASKS ACT.  1926. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I should be glad to have the atithority of my colleagues for the preparation and submission to the Home Affairs Committee of a short Bill to amend the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926.This Act requires an indication of origin to be applied to imported goods, (a) if they are sold or exposed for sale bearing any name or trademark which is, or purports to be, the name or trademark of any manufacturer, dealer or trader or the name of any place or district in the United Kingdom, and (b) if they are subject to an Order-in-Council made under the Act. Section 10 of the Act provides that the indication of origin shall consist, at the option of the person applying it, of either the word &quot;Foreign&quot; or &quot;Empire&quot;, as the case may be, or a definite indication of the country in which the goods were manufactured or produced.There has been considerable pressure in recent months from all parts&apos;of the House and from many other quarters to remove this option and to require goods covered by the Act to be marked with the name of the country whence they originated.    The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and I felt it necessary to consult the principal commercial, industrial and agricultural interests. Their replies indicated that some divergence of opinion between manufacturing interests on the one hand and importers and merchants on the other, still exists;   but, no doubt in view of the international situation, the opposition to any change is not very weighty.     We came to the conclusion, in the light of the evidence obtained, that there are sufficient grounds in principle
for removing the option, and I made an announcement to that effect in the House of Commons on July 4th.The amending Bill which I have in mind would accordingly merely remove the existing option to use the word &quot;Foreign&quot; or &quot;Empire&quot; and would not seek to amend the law relating to Merchandise Marks in any other respect.      Provisions would, of course, he included to safeguard traders against loss or undue inconvenience in connection with stocks which have been marked in accordance with the existing law, and to deal with the obvious difficulties of marking blended goods.I have prepared this note in consultation with the Minister of Agricxilture and Fisheries, who is in full agreement with me.O.F.G.S.    -BOARD OF TRADE, July,  1939.
