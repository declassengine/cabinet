(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S ECRET.CP.  152 (59).COPY NO.    Q-Q^ ,CABINET.CZECH BALANCES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.Last October, when the then Government ofCzecho-Slovakia appealed, to us for financial help in view of its weakened position after the Munich Agreement, we announced that we would help it to the extent of  10 millions and the Bank of England at our request opened a credit for this amount in favour of the Czech Government.2. In February of this year,  the Czecho-Slovakia(Financial Assistance) Act was carried, under which theTreasury repaid to the Bank of England the  10 millionsso advanced and new arrangements were made with the czecho-Slovak Government as to the help it should receive.      We and the French undertook to guarantee a loan of  8 millions to be raised by the Czecho-Slovak Government;     6 millions out of our advance of  10 millions was to be repaid by means of this loan;    and the balance of  4 millions was to constitute a free gift from Britain to help refugees from Czecho-Slovakia.      The loan has never been raised, so that the present position is that we lent Czecho-Slovakia  6 millions and made a free gift of  4 millions.
3. Of this money,  6-g- millions in all lias remainedwith the Bank&apos;of England in two accounts opened in favour of the National Bank of Czecho-Slovakia.      The Bank of England also hold  7 millions in gold for the National Bank.      Since, owing to the invasion and annexation of Bohemia and Moravia,  the purpose of the loan has failed, we are plainly entitled to get back the  6 millions.     We are also entitled to put our hands, if we can,  on so much of the  4 millions as has not already been spent on refugees in order to secure that the rest of the free gift shall be administered according to our intentionso4. When the invasion of Czecho-Slovakia took placelast March, we immediately laid an embargo on credits held in this country on Czecho-Slovak account.    (I may say that this prompt action of ours was not initiated by any other country).      This was to prevent the repetition of what occurred when the Germans invaded Austria and acquired by compulsion the foreign exchange lying here.      We have validated the embargo by the Czecho-Slovakia (Restriction on Banking Accounts,  etc.) Act passed at the end of March, which has blocked in the hands of British debtors debts owing by them to Czecho-Slovak creditors.      But the Act does not say what is to happen next.      The only provision in the Act is that the Treasury may consent to a specific release and this has been done in a few individual cases.
5. The total amount blocked here for the account ofthe National Bank of Czecho-Slovakia is  13-g- millions at the Bank of England and about  500,000 (for Refugees) at another London Bank.     The blocked amounts held here on account of other persons and institutions are not likely to amount to more than  l-g- millions, excluding those specifically pledged and those which may, for special reasons, have to be released, and securities not easily realisable.6. On the other hand, British claims are roughlyas follows:-  millionsTreasury (repayment of advance) 6Refugee assistance 3*75(about  250,000 has already been spent on refugee assistance)Cash claims put forward by various British creditors 3.8In addition there are claims in respect of:-(a) Bonds of various denominations owing from former Czecho-Slovakia and from institutions therein to a nominal capital amount of  2.4 millions;(b) industrial participations, real estate, etc.  to a very considerable total.7. The position as regards money for refugeesneeds to be stated in rather more detail.     Theoriginal plan   was that an organisation of the czech Government called the Refugee Institutein Prague arranged to pay the proper amount of financial help to departing refugees in accordance with
ST) *&quot;\plans made between the Institute and the various voluntary committees acting in various countries.    In the case of Britain it was the British Committee for Refugees from Czecho-Slovakia in Mecklenburg Square. The British Liaison Officer, Mro Stopford, who was in Prague, authorised the transfer of funds from time to time to the Refugee Institute for this piirpose^    This is the means by which about  250,000 out of the  4 millions has been expended (and a further  500,000 earmarked).      There is, however, a larger total of about  2 millions which is needed for refugees who have already left and who are in transit for their ultimate destination,  in order to pay their landing money, etco      The balance of the  4 millions ought to be used for helping further refugees.    There seems to be great objection to leaving the Refugee Institute in Prague (which the Germans presumably can control) a free hand to decide how the remaining refugee money is to be spent, and the Home Office intend to appoint British trustees in this country who would administer grants from the Refugee   Fund in futures both as regards refugees who have already emigrated and as regards future emigration.;8. Briefly, then,  the position is that we haveblocked assets likely to amount to about  15-g- millions and desire to obtain satisfaction of the Treasury claim for  6 millions and also to secure the transfer of about  3f millions to a Czech Refugee Fund administered by
British Trustees.      Then there are private cash claims amounting (as presented) to  3*8 millions and private claims in respect of bonds, industrial participations, real estate, etc.9. &apos;/e have now to decide whether to attempt tosettle these matters by negotiating with the German Government.      Further, even if we decide to negotiate, we may not succeed  -in reaching agreement and if we decide either to negotiate at all or fail after negotiation to get agreement, legislation will be required in order to enable us to take unilaterally such action as we can.     As the Session is very near to its close, I have considered whether we should not immediately introduce legislation so as to be able to deal with the matter in the event of our deciding not to negotiate or in the event of negotiations breaking down.      The Bill would presumably provide that the Treasury may require Banks etc.  to furnish precise particulars to the Treasury of Czech balances and assets subject to restriction;    that the Treasury may require Banks etc. to transfer such balances and assets to the Treasury;    that Banks etc. shall receive an indemnity; and that assets shall be used to discharge specified classes of claims (including repayment of the Treasury advance) and to make the transfer to the Czech Refugee Fund.      It could be provided that assets not used to meet claims should remain subject to restriction under the Czecho-Slovakia (Restrictions etc.) Act passed in March until further notice.      The Bill would presumably provide penalties for non-compliance.
10. Though there is much to he said for taking powerto act unilaterally, unilateral action would in fact involvea number of difficulties of various kinds:-(a) The German Government (who, after informal talks, have expressed their willingness to open discussions) would regard it as very unreasonable that we should refuse to negotiate;    they might denounce our action as showing that we regard ourselves as practically in a state of war already and might even   do anything they could to devise reprisals such as the denunciation of the Standstill Agreement covering our short-term banking credits, amounting toover  40 millions.      The more moderate section of German opinion, which, we understand, has with some difficulty induced the German Government to propose negotiations, would regard themselves as having received a great rebuff. It would be represented that the Banks, companies and individuals whose balances we are confiscating cannot justly be deprived of their property in order to pay debts due to British creditors from other and quite distinct Czech debtors.(b) The refugee work would be seriously hampered, since we could not expect co-operation from the Refugee Institute at Prague and the use of part of the Refugee Fund to assist future emigration might become impossible.(c) It would be exceedingly difficult to verify the claims presented to us, since we should have no means of testing a statement that a claimant holds a particular
k tJsum to his. credit at a Bank in Prague if there is no co-operation from the other side0(d)    The only method of obtaining satisfaction for the very large claims in respect of industrial participations, rents and other annual payments is to obtain an assurance that all payments will be fully made and transferred in sterling, but no such assurance could be obtained except as the result of negotiations. It would be an almost impossible task to meet such claims by a capital payment as the real value of a block of shares in a Czech industry is impossible to assess and in any case the claims are so considerable that the distribution of the amount available in the form of capital payments would be bound to cause great dissatisfaction.11.       Although these difficulties are very real, they are hardly suitable to be quoted in public as a reason for entering into negotiations.      If we were to admit that it would either be wrong morally or very difficult practically to deal with the matter by unilateral action, we should open negotiations under a very great disadvantage as it would appear that we were bound to conclude an agreement, however unfair the terms offered to us by the Germans.-7-
12.       On the other hand., the objections to negotiating with the Germans are such as can and certainly will be stated in public with great vigour.    The object of the Germans in entering into the negotiations will be to obtain the surrender of as large a proportion as possible of the blocked sterling to the German Government. Following upon the B.1.8. trouble5 I think the House of Commons would violently object to providing the Germans at the present time with further foreign exchange.    Triis difficulty could, to some extent, be met by our stipulating tnat any surplus of the blocked sterlin^ not required for casn ...a. ments should be available only for the purchase of United Kingdom goods which would exclude both armaments and raw materials required for armaments.    This might help to allay criticism, but it would, of course, make the negotiations so much the more difficult.In any event, there would remain the objection that the Germans are in the position of burglars and that to negotiate with burglars is morally wrong.13.       It would be possible to combine the taking of power to act unilaterally with the opening of negotiationss but I am satisfied that the House of Commons would see very considerable objection to any scheme which contemplated the two alternatives that the blocked assets should be dealt with either unilaterally in the manner prescribed in a Bill or as the result of any agreement reacned with the German authorities,    v/e cannot expect to obtain a free hand to n^ogtiate with the Germans and the Bill would need to jrovide eitner that, even in any
agreement, the assets should he dealt with in certain specified ways (which would of course detract very considerably from the value of negotiations) or that any agreement should not be brought into operation until it nad received tne specific ax^proval of Parliament; for example, by means of an affirmative resolution of both Houses.14.        we are thus faced with a s situation in which there are very strong objections both to any refusal to negotiate with the German Government on this question and to any attempt to reach such an agreement without the specific approval of Parliament.    The latter appearsto me to be the overriding political consideration and. that being so, it would appear to be impossible in practice to deal with the assets until the autumn because, while one might contemplate the passage of legislation before the end of the Session, it is clearly out of the question, in addition, to reach an agreement with the Germans and submit that agreement to Parliament for approval before the Summer recess.    In these circumstances I i;ave sought for a solution which, while avoiding the dangers inherent in any refusal to negotiate , would fully safeguard tne rights of Parliament in this matter. I suggest that sucn a solution might be found on the following lines.We might announce in the House of Commons that the assets blocked under the Czecho-Slovakia (Restrictions on Banking Accounts, etc.) Act cannot remain blocked indefinitely; and that we propose to work out a Scheme for dealing with those assets and in particular for a distribution in settlement of British claims (including
the repayment of the Treasury advance and the unblocking of the balance of the money which Parliament made available for Refugees),    In that connection it would be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government, under the authority of appropriate legislation, to act unilaterally, but there are certain practical reasons which make it desirable that unilateral action should, if possible, be avoided and that this scheme, more particularly as regards the handling of the Refugee problem and the assessment of claims, should be worked out in conjunction with the de facto authorities in Praguec    It is therefore proposed to open discussions with the German authorities, but the House of Commons may rest assured that any scheme for the distribution of the assets, whether brought into operation unilaterally or agreed upon with the German authorities will be made subject to the specific approval of Parliament before being brought into operation.15.        Proposals on these lines will certainly evoke criticism from those creditors of Czecho-Slovakia who are anxious that their claims should be settled and who point out with justice that these assets have been blocked since March and that it is nigh time that the Government produced a scheme for the settlement of their claims.    This criticism is however much less difficult to meet than the repercussions which would result either from immediate unilateral action or from any attempt to obtain powers enabling the Government to make a distribu-tion following upon an agreement with the German authorities0    As a choice of evils I certainly prefer the course outlined in the preceding paragraph of this memorandum.
16.       I ought to add that if the distribution of the blocked assets is postponed until the autumn (as it would be in effect under my suggested scheme) there may well be serious xjractical difficulties as the result of lack of funds for Refugees.    It is undesirable that this work should continue to be held up and I would propose to overcome those difficulties by arranging for the immediate presentation of a Supplementary Estimate designed to provide the necessary funds on a temporary basis until such time as the sums blocked in the Refugee account at the Bank of England can be releaseds either under legislation or in accordance with the terms of any scheme agreed to by the Germans and approved by Parliament.    Any sums actually expended under the Supplementary Estimate would fall to be recouped to the Exchequer out of that Refugee fund account when set free.    The Supplementary Estimate would probably require to be promoted by the Home Office j, and consultations between the Treasury and the Home Office are already in hand. -17.       I ask authority from the Cabinet to proceed as suggested in paragraphs 14 and 16 of this memorandum. There is no entirely satisfactory procedure to overcome all these difficulties but I think tne above method, though it only postpones some of the conundrums, is tne best available.(Initialled)    J.S.: Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. 8th July, 1939.
