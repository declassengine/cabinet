SECEET. Copy No.CP. 153 (39).CABINET.FOREIGN PUBLICITY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN accordance with the wish expressed in Cabinet some little time ago (Cabinet 32 (39)), I circulate for the information of my colleagues a note on what is being done in the way of publicity work abroad.I need hardly say that any suggestions that any member of the Cabinet may have to make will be gratefully received and carefully considered.H.Foreign Of/ice, July 10, 1939.A Survey of our Foreign Publicity.OUR propaganda should be regarded from two points of view whether it be short-term or long-term; whether it be used to obtain some immediate political objective or whether it aims at building up a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding of this country abroad. Both are necessary, but fundamentally the latter is more important because it is more lasting. Without the solid foundation of knowledge short-term propaganda will probably fail to take root. Hence the best answer to the hostile propaganda of the totalitarian States is to educate foreigners in the British point of view, to explain the British way of life, as shown in our institutions, our education, art, science, and literature, and to give facts and figures about our industrial strength and the way it is being adapted for purposes of defence.During the last few years our propaganda has mainly concentrated on a long-term programme. This has been the guiding principle of the work of the British Council, which has been maintained and developed on the understanding that our cultural and educational propaganda abroad has been accepted as a permanent feature of our national activities.British Council.Any paper on our propaganda, therefore, should begin with a brief survey of what the British Council has attempted and so far achieved. Established in November 1934, it adopted as its primary task the spreading of a knowledge of the English language abroad, on the ground that with a knowledge of the language there would come a desire to learn more about the British point of view and the British way of life. The British Council&apos;s work, therefore, was first and foremost educational, and with this in view it divided the area to be covered into zones of political or commercial importance. As events developed these zones became more clearly defined, and to-day the maximum effort is being made in the Arabic-speaking countries of the Near and Middle East, in the Mediterranean basin, in the Balkans and in South America.   Work has also10461   [19613] this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1939.
been carried on, though on a less intensive scale, in the Scandinavian countries, Finland, the Baltic States, Poland, Holland, Belgium ahd Italy. Plans are now being laid&apos; to make the greatest possible effort in Spain&apos;. &quot;&apos;,       :&apos; (a) Educational. There are -two ways - of supplying a British education to foreigners, either by establishing British schools and institutes abroad&apos; or&quot;by providing scholarships for foreign- students to study in British Universities.! From the &quot;outset1 an attempt was made to secure a balance between the two. In&apos; the course of- the last year 154 foreign students, covering nearly every European country and South America, were brought here for a year&apos;s study in an English University. In; the selection of candidates special attention has been given to teachers of English in foreign schools, on the ground that they would be con-tinuing their work when they returned home and would be useful propagandists of British ideas. In addition many students have come for various technical courses, including a certain number of industrial apprentices.Propaganda through scholarships for students aims at quality rather than quantity and necessarily takes time to produce results. British education pro-vided abroad/not only covers a larger number of pupils, but makes an immediate impression in the countries in&apos; which it is conducted, especially in smaller countries. It has a distinct value as a sign that the British are interested in the country concerned. The British Council has therefore assisted existing British schools and institutes abroad either by a financial subvention or by provision of books and teachers and has also established British schools and institutes and University Chairs of English in those centres where the need was most urgent. Care has been taken to provide a British education for all British subjects abroad wherever it has been practicable and especially in the Near East, where the needs of the Maltese have received special attention. During the last year alone British Institutes have been opened in Lisbon, Malta, Athens and Bucharest and in the immediate future institutes of the same standing are to be opened in Rome, Belgrade and Zagreb. The enthusiasm which has attended the establishment of these institutes is remarkable; the demands for admittance, have greatly exceeded the present capacity and immediate expansion has in every case become necessary.The British Institute is for more advanced study in the English language and English thought; it is not established until a good deal of preliminary spade-work has been done and has so far been confined to those centres where the need has been shown to be most urgent; but in addition to these establishments there are scattered throughout the countries in which the British Council is working over 200 Foreign-British societies where in many cases English is taught and where in all cases books, periodicals and lecturers are supplied. In Yugoslavia alone there are 21 such societies, .but they are numerous also in many other countries, such as Poland, Sweden, &amp;c. The British Council has a full list of all such societies to which it gives assistance in one form or another. It would not be possible to compute with accuracy the effect of all this work, but H.M. Missions abroad are satisfied that it is considerable. For some time past it has been the practice of the British Council to send members of its staff to inspect the work being done on the spot.(b) Books, A rt, Music, Drama. The purely educational work of the British Council, though the most important, forms only a part of its very varied activities. The supply of books and periodicals abroad to an ever-increasing number of institutions has now assumed considerable dimensions.   Exhibitions of British Art have been held in a number of European capitals; British music has been made known more widely by sending British musicians or choirs to perform abroad, by supplying full scores of works by British composers, and by sending gramo-phone records1 Of English music, which are often used by foreign broadcasting companies. &apos; A musical scholarship of some value for a course of three years&apos; study in London is keenly contested for.  So far the winners include a Bulgarian, an Estonian and a Finn.   As regards drama, the Council has financed tours by the Old Vic and&apos;the Dublin Gate Theatre to the Mediterranean countries, the -Balkans;and;the--Near East&apos;, and are now sending, in collaboration with the Danes, ^Mfv John:&amp;ielgud&apos;s production of &quot;Hamlet &quot; to be performed atElsinore. as-ad ipMojig^-ine -bulk&apos; of -the^CounciFs funds have gone to build a stronger -^position-abroad(for&apos; this! couhtfy in the future, steps have also been taken to ;-secure more-rapid results&quot; by means of films and the foreign press.  Hence these : two activities of the Council should be treated separately. &apos;
(c) Films. This is the least organised and least developed form of our propaganda, though it is clearly one of the most important. It is the quickest and perhaps the most effective way of influencing the masses in foreign countries, certainly in those countries where the figure of illiteracy stands high. It is doubtful, however, whether film propaganda can be dealt with satisfactorily without a national organisation for the purpose, an organisation with the standing and authority to impress itself upon the film industry as a whole. What exists at present for securing the distribution abroad of suitable British films can only be regarded as a temporary makeshift pending the creation of a more important body.The two bodies concerned with film propaganda abroad, the British Council and the Travel Association, agreed in 1936 to set up a Joint Film Committee on which the Foreign Office, the Department of Overseas Trade, the General Post Office and the British Film Institute were also represented. The Travel Associa-tion offered the technical section of their film unit while the British Council provided the funds for the distribution of films abroad. In 1938-39 the British Council provided  4,000, which was spent partly on adapting and re-editing existing films and partly on the purchase of the rights of films for distribution abroad. Outlets were secured in 72 countries, including the Travel Association^ special distribution in.the Dominions and the United States of America. In 57 of these countries the films were shown commercially in cinemas, in other cases they were shown to members of Foreign-British Societies.In addition to this a special effort was made to supply the theatre in the British Pavilion at the New York World Fair with newsreels and films with constantly changing programmes during the whole period that the Fair was open. For this purpose the Joint Films Committee inspected 182 films, of which they approved and sent to New York 114. In collaboration with the Newsreel Associa-tion they also arranged for a composite weekly newsreel with a special commen-tary. Information received from New York shows that the films shown have met with great success. There have been seven continuous performances from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., with a daily admission of 2,000 people. For this purpose alone the British Council provided  10,000. For the year 1939-40 the British Council are allotting the sum of  25,000 for films and the supply of projectors for Foreign-British Societies.(d) Press. The Press Department of the British Council was formed some 18 months ago. Its function has been to supply articles to foreign newspapers on all kinds of cultural subjects and to provide material for special British supple-ments. Articles are in many cases accompanied by photographs. Contacts have been made with editors direct as far as possible and now cover as many as 400 newspapers. Although purely political articles are not included, the word &apos;&apos; cultural&apos;&apos; has been extended to cover articles on our defence measures and British achievements generally. In many countries which are nervous of publishing political articles which might&quot; antagonise Germany and Italy, the British Council&apos;s articles are particularly welcome and enable good publicity about this country to be obtained without giving any excuse for protests from the German and Italian Governments.An equally important part of the press activities of the British Council has been the invitations given to parties of foreign editors to visit England as the guests of the Council: This year parties have come from Norway, Turkey, Roumania and Spain and others are due later from Portugal, Argentina and Poland. These visits not only produce very wide publicity in the countries con-cerned, but also influence favourably men of some importance in their own country who are often glad to continue the contacts once made.(e) &quot; Britain To-Day.&quot; Apart from press activities the British Council also sponsors a fortnightly publication under this name in English,; French, German, Italian and Spanish. It is sent in the language the recipient prefers to 10,000 addresses mainly in Europe and South America. The addresses, supplied in most eases by His Majesty&apos;s Missions, are those of &quot; key &quot; men in various walks of life. So far nine numbers of Britain To-day have appeared. It avoids controversy and seeks to set out soberly a British point of view not only on,the international situation, but on a variety of administrative problems at home. That it has been welcomed by the recipients can to a certain extent be judged by the,fact that in the last six weeks alone 310 letters have been received either expressing interest or asking that copies be sent to friends.  Of these 310 letters, 102 have come from10461   [19613] n 2
Yugoslavia, 33 from Poland, 33 from Holland, 18 from France and 17 from Portugal. The professions of the writers have been as follows : University posts 50; Ministers and former Ministers 30; Business 37; School teachers 18; Doctors 28; Lawyers 13; Journalists 14; Army and Navy 11; Engineers 5.It is proposed at the end of the summer to add four pages of illustrations and to double the circulation.Broadcasting.It is broadcasting that offers the quickest and most direct means of bringing a daily British information service to foreign peoples in their own languages. To meet obvious requirements in this field, the B.B.C. undertook at the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the autumn of 1937, the task of organising the first foreign-language broadcasts from Great Britain. These services have been, from the beginning, a direct responsibility of the B.B.C., but they have been conducted in close and regular consultation with the News Department, and now the Foreign Publicity Department, of the Foreign Office.The foreign-language broadcasts were limited at the outset, pending the construction of two new high-power transmitters, to a&apos;daily news-bulletin in Arabic, prefaced by supporting entertainment and talks, and to daily news-bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese, directed to Latin America. At the culmina-tion of the Czecho-Slovak crisis, in September 1938, an emergency news service in French, German and Italian was added. These broadcasts, directed to the Continent of Europe, both on the medium and on the short waves, proved an instant success, and were placed soon afterwards on a permanent footing. They have since been expanded to provide two bulletins in each of the three languages nightly and a quarter-hour period of German talks and Press summary. Since early June there have also been included in the Corporation&apos;s European Service nightly bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese which are radiated on the short wave to Spain and Portugal. The most recent development, made possible by the com-pletion of new transmitters, has been the provision of a full supporting programme of entertainment features and talks in the service to Latin America.The &quot; straight &quot; news-bulletin, drafted in a form appropriate to its destina-tion, yet scrupulously accurate, has been and will continue to be the spear-head of all these services. It has undoubtedly been successful in providing a, daily British summary of world news and a fair presentation of British policy and progress to listeners over a large part of Europe, throughout the Arabic countries and, on a smaller scale, to the Republics of Latin America. It has proved itself a powerful antidote, by correction and by contrast, to the propaganda of the totalitarian States, and it has penetrated effectively into Germany. The talks contributed to the daily German broadcast by writers of standing, combined with frequent Press summaries, have ensured that clear statements of British views are regularly available to many Germans. Talks also play their part in the Arabic and Latin American Services of the B.B.C., both of which have the further support of specially designed programmes of entertainment.Although broadcasting in foreign languages may be regarded, in present circumstances, primarily as an instrument of short-term propaganda, the part that it is fitting itself to play in a concerted scheme of long-term effort is by no means to be left out of mind. It seems more likely, however, that requests for further expansion of existing services or institution of new services, within the technical resources of the B.B.C., will be determined by immediate needs in con-tested or otherwise crucial regions. There should be a fair expectation that expenditure on such services will be justified by the return; and, for this to be ascertained, the Foreign Publicity Department, in conjunction with the B.B.C., will invariably need to possess a reasonably accurate estimate of listening facilities and reception conditions in the particular country or language area which it is desired to reach.Apart from the B.B.C&apos;s broadcasts, attempts are being made to supply talks on British subjects for use by foreign broadcasting stations. A body known as the Joint Broadcasting Committee, which is officially financed, exists to do this work. The object is to prepare talks on suitable subjects, translate and record them and then send them free for use by the broadcasting stations willing to broadcast them. For example, 12 talks were asked for by Roumania of which 6 have already been despatched.   Similar arrangements are now being made for
Greece. For &quot;Yugoslavia regular letters from London are to be sent to a well-known resident in Belgrade, who will translate and read them at the microphone. In addition, regular talks, to Belgrade and Zagreb are.to be given by a Yugoslav resident in London. For Hungary there is to be a weekly London Letter from Lady Listowel, who is Hungarian by birth. Negotiations are now in progress with the following further countries Holland, Belgium, France, Sweden, United States of America.Industrial Publicity.A recommendation made by the Co-ordinating Committee last summer, of which Sir R. Vansittart was Chairman, led to the sum of  10,000 being, voted for the D.O.T. to set up an Industrial Publicity Unit. This unit, which has now been in operation for over two months, conducts its activities outside the D.O.T. under the control of an editorial publicity journalist. No pajnnents are made for space, whether editorial or advertising, publicity for articles and news items being obtained on their news or interest value. Mr. Robert Williamson, whom the D.O.T. selected as head of the unit, maintains close touch with the British Council, the B.B.C. (the latter uses material thus supplied for foreign language broadcasts), the Travel Association, Reuters and the Federation of British Industries. News items are being produced for the Empire and foreign press at the rate of one a day and 16 special articles, each dealing with a particular industry, are being sent out every month. Mr. -Williamson also maintains close contact with the five British newsreel companies, suggesting to them subjects of industrial interest calculated to improve this country&apos;s industrial prestige.Foreign Publicity Department of the Foteign Office.Until recently all the above-mentioned forms of propaganda were supervised and stimulated by the News Department of the Foreign Office, which had in most cases taken the initiative in establishing them. As the work grew, it became clear that that department was too small to deal with the many questions which were arising and the numerous suggestions which were flowing into the Foreign Office from people outside. Some of these suggestions had to be postponed, or could.at best be only tentatively examined. A case in point was the question of establishing personal contacts with people in foreign countries either by specially arranged visits or through the usual business channels. . ,The decision, therefore, to strengthen the foreign publicit)^ work of the Foreign Office by establishing a special and enlarged department for the purpose should facilitate not only closer contacts with the existing publicity organisations, but more intensive study of individual countries for publicity purposes. The new department of the Foreign Office is therefore being organised both geographically and functionally. Its functions briefly are to make suggestions to and supervise the work of the British Council and of the B-B.C.&apos;s foreign language broadcasts, and, in addition, to institute any other forms of propaganda which, with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Missions abroad, can be usefully undertaken. For this purpose each foreign country is being studied as a separate problem and, in so far as special forms of publicity are not suitable for the British Council to undertake, the Foreign Office will take action direct. For example, it is intended to prepare a number of pamphlets translated into foreign languages for distribution to picked addresses. The object of these pamphlets will be to give a correct and impressive picture of British strength and British resources and of the main lines of British policy. Authoritative statements on policy by Government speakers will also be translated and circulated. Articles are also to be written . by competent writers for insertion in the foreign press. It is further intended to draw up in the form of a short pamphlet a number of talking points for people going abroad. The use to be made of these talking points will need careful consideration, but through the Federation of British Industries it* should be possible to place them confidentially in the hands.of a number of leading firms so that they may themselves instruct their own people who.are- travelling abroad. These talking points will have to be kept up to date. In addition.it is hoped-to obtain from certain firms who have their own representatives:- abroad - any suggestions which from their local knowledge they may care to make.
As regards news telegraphed from this country, there are three distinct British channels apart from the flow of news going from foreign correspondents in London. These are the British Official Wireless, Reuters and ,the Exchange Telegraph Co. The British Official Wireless is drawn up in the Foreign Publicity Department of the Foreign Office and sent out in Morse three times daily. It contains purely British news and is distributed free. Reuters supply a continuous stream of news throughout the day, but this is world news and not exclusively British. It is sent out from Leafield and Rugby on the multiple address system and goes to the national news agencies in different countries. Distribution to foreign newspapers is effected by the latter, who have the power to censor the messages and omit what they wish. Reuters are debarred by the arrangements with the national news agencies from sending messages direct to newspapers. Negotiations are in progress between Reuters on the one hand and the Foreign Office and the Treasury on the other to see how far and on what terms a subsidy to Reuters would be justified. The sum of  30,000 is at present under consideration, but the terms have not yet been agreed. Meanwhile, as an interim measure dating from the crisis last September, the Foreign Office are continuing to make a small payment to Reuters for their Leafield service, which is available to European countries, to enable them to increase their daily service from 1,000 to 3,000 words. The Exchange Telegraph Co. have instituted a daily news service to certain foreign countries. It differs from Reuters in that it goes direct to certain foreign newspapers. This service is obtaining good results already, though it is on a small scale compared with Reuters. The Foreign Office have given what encouragement they can to it.Publicity work in enemy countries has to be regarded as a separate part of the departments work. Although the B.B.C.&apos;s broadcasts in German are the most important means of reaching the German public daily, there are other ways which are less open. Through His Majesty&apos;s Embassy and Consulates in Germany &quot; Heutiges England,&apos;&apos; the German edition of &quot;Britain To-day,&quot; is circulated to some 500 people carefully selected. A similar circulation is made of important speeches by members of the Government, which are translated into German and printed here. But a much wider distribution of pamphlets in German is being effected through special channels. The British origin of these pamphlets is concealed as carefully as possible, as they enter Germany through various countries and are written by Germans. This side of the work is not borne on the Foreign Office Vote in order that it may be dealt with as discreetly as possible.The Foreign Publicity Department is still in process of formation and the expansion of its activities is proceeding rapidly. It is not, therefore, possible at this stage to define its future scope with any great precision. Suggestions from outside, which are many and various, have to be sorted carefully to avoid dispersal of effort, as it is important to concentrate on those lines of publicity likely to be most effective. The main object of our propaganda should be to present a picture of this country to the outside world which will be intelligible, convincing and definite, so that the world may know that a distinctively British point of view exists and understand what it is.
