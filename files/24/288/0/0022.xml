MOLOTOV does not become any easier to deal with as the weeks pass. He has, it is true, now made himself familiar with the details of our problem; and you will have noticed that the drafts he produces, whether they are his own or prepared by his experts, are, ingeniously constructed though they are, I am told, couched in inelegant Russian. But it is difficult to get to grips with him. He seems to be bored with detailed discussion; and the admirable argumentative material with which you supply us makes little impression on him. It took us, for example, an inordinate time trying to make clear to him the difference between initialling an agreement, signing an agreement, and bringing an agreement into force, and even now we are not sure that he has grasped it. Indeed we have sometimes felt that the differences which have arisen between us might perhaps be based on some colossal misunderstanding. And yet we have usually come to the conclusion in the end that this is not so, and that Molotov has seen clearly the extent of the difference between the respective positions of the two sides.2. On the whole the negotiations have been a humiliating experience. Time after time we have taken up a position and a week later we have abandoned it; and we have had the feeling that Molotov was convinced from the beginning that we should be forced to abandon it.3. This was, I think, inevitable. It is we, not the Russians, who took the initiative in starting negotiations. Our need for an agreement is more immediate than theirs. Unlike them we have assumed obligations which we may be obliged to fulfil any day; and some of the obligations we have undertaken are of benefit to the Soviet Union since they protect a good part of their western frontier. Having committed ourselves to these obligations, we have no other policy open to us than that of building up the Peace Front. The Russians have, in the last resort, at least two alternative policies, namely, the policy of isolation, and the 10492   [19715]
policy of accommodation with Germany. We are being urged by our press and by our public to conclude an agreement quickly; and the Russians have good reason to assume that we shall not dare to face a final breakdown of the negotiations. This is the strength of their negotiating position, and this makes it certain that if we want an agreement with them we shall have to pay their price or something very near it.4. This does not mean that the Russians are not themselves anxious to reach an agreement and that they would view a break with equanimity. On the contrary, they would hardly have entered upon these negotiations at all unless they thought that a Three-Power Agreement was to their advantage. But we must remember that the conclusion of. a close political and military alliance with two capitalist Powers would be something quite new in their foreign policy. These negotiations are as much an adventure for them as they are for us. If we do not trust them, they equally do not trust us. They are not, fundamentally, a friendly Power; but they, like us, are driven to this course by force of necessity. If we are in two minds about the wisdom of what we are doing, so are they. It is possible that there are differences of opinion in the Kremlin about it, and it is this uneasiness on both sides which is making the negotiations so difficult. It is quite likely that one reason for the dropping of Litvinov was that at this critical turn in their foreign policy the Kremlin wished to place one of their own jnen in charge of the negotiations rather than someone like Litvinov, who, however faithful a servant he might have been, was not one of the inner circle but one who might be open to influences from which Molotov, for example, would be immune.5. Their distrust and suspicion of us has not diminished during the negotiations, nor, I think, has their respect for us increased. The fact that we have raised difficulty after difficulty on points which seem to them unessential has created an impression that we may not be seriously seeking an agreement; while the fact that we have yielded in the end would tend to remind them that we are still the same Powers who have (as they see it) capitulated in the past to Japan, Italy and Germany and that we are likely to do so again in the future. We should perhaps have been wiser to pay the Soviet price for this agreement at an earlier stage, since we are not in a good position to bargain and since, as the international situation deteriorates, the Soviet price is likely to rise. We could probably have got a better agreement by closing quickly with the substance of the Soviet draft of the 2nd June than we shall get to-day.6. The Soviet Government are determined that any obligations which they undertake shall be clearly defined, with all the &quot; i &quot;s dotted and all the &quot; t &quot;s crossed. They will not assume any obligation of any kind until its definition is complete whether on the political or the military side. Where their own special interests are at stake and where they claim to regard themselves as being especially vulnerable, namely, in the Baltic States, they are determined to ensure that our assistance shall be forthcoming not only in the event of aggression of the classical type, but also in the event of aggressive action undertaken according to the new technique with which the Axis Powers have made us familiar. If we wish to understand how they feel about the Baltic States we have only to imagine what our own attitude would be to the establishment of German influence over Holland or Belgium.7. At the point which the negotiations have now reached we seem to have several alternatives before us. We might accept the Soviet view about the inseparability of the political and military agreements and break on the definition of indirect aggression. Of we might accept the Soviet definition of indirect aggression and break on article 6. Of we might accept neither and break on both. If (as seems to be the case) we cannot in fact face a break on any of these grounds, we might revert to the idea of an agreement limited to the case of direct aggression upon a signatory; or we might accept the Soviet draft of article 6, start military conversations at once, and continue our efforts meanwhile to reach an agreement on the definition of indirect aggression. I am inclined to think that the last would be the best course unless (which I still think is not quite out of the question) we can fix up a more or less satisfactory definition of indirect aggression in return for accepting the Soviet position on article 6.
8. I have been trying to think of compromise drafts for the definition of indirect aggression. I feel certain that we cannot maintain intact both of the tests upon which we have insisted, but we might be able to maintain one of them  and this the more important of the two namely, the test of the abandonment of independence or neutrality. Any compromise formula would have to be some-what more detailed than our own and it would have to follow, superficially at any rate, the general structure of the Soviet draft. Do you think you could accept something on the following lines? : &apos;&quot; It is agreed between the three contracting Governments that the expres-sion &quot;indirect aggression&apos; in paragraph 2 above is to be understood as covering.          .    under pressure or threat of force by action accepted by the State in question---under the influence of:European Power (including the use by that PoAver of the territory and forces of the State in question for purposes of aggression) of such a character as to involve the abandonment by that State of its independence or neutrality.&quot;9. This draft attenuates the test of &quot; threat of force &quot; but maintains the test of &quot; abandonment of independence or neutrality.&quot; The draft would be better from our point of view if we could say : &quot; including the use by that Power of the territory of the State in question as a passage or base of operations for purposes of aggression.&quot;That, you may remember, is the phrase we used in the Anglo-French Declaration to Belgium of April 1937; but Molotov would, T am sure, find it too restrictive.10. M. Molotov has made it clear that, unless we admit the inseparability of the political and military articles, there can be no agreement. The objections to this are cogently stated in paragraph 10 of your telegram No. 167; and it is, indeed, extraordinary that we should be expected to talk military secrets with the Soviet Government before we are sure that they will be our allies. But it seems to us here that, from one point of view, we should not stand to lose much by accepting the Soviet position, and, indeed, that it might be to our advantage to do so, for the following reasons : 11. If the Soviet Government had accepted our draft of article 6 and if agreement had been reached on all other outstanding points, the result of the present negotiations would have been a treaty of mutual assistance signed and juridically in force, to be supplemented by a military agreement at the earliest possible date. If, in similar circumstances, we were to accept the Soviet draft of article 6, the immediate result would probably be official announcements by the contracting Governments outlining the contents of the political articles of a politico-military agreement which would not come into force until the military articles had been agreed upon, and announcements that military conversations were to be opened immediately. As a means of giving satisfaction to our public or as a deterrent to a possible aggressor, the first solution would no doubt look better than the second; but we doubt whether there is much in this, since it is the opening of military conversations which would be the most potent factor in either event, and these could be started immediately in either case.12. But if what we had in mind was to bind the Soviet Government by treaty as early as possible to give us effective assistance in the event of our being, attacked, or in the event of our having to fulfil our obligations (for example) to Poland, there seems to be little to choose between the two courses. If the Soviet Government had signed a political agreement in advance of the military agree-ment, they would be bound in law to help us; but, pending the conclusion of the military agreement, they would probably, while admitting their obligation, contend that as no concrete military arrangements had been made, and as in particular no arrangement had been reached between the Soviet Union and Poland, there was in- practice no possibility of their giving us effective help. On the other hand, the absence of a military agreement would not stand in the way of the fulfilment by Great Britain and France of their obligation to assist the Soviet Union were the latter to be involved in hostilities in defence (say) of the Baltic States, since, unlike the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France are not separated from Germany by another State, like Poland.   The political
agreement, had it been signed, would thus have tended to bind us more effectively than it would have bound the Soviet Union. From this point of view it might be more advantageous for us to adopt the Soviet draft of article 6 rather than our own. Under the Soviet draft of article 6, we should also be under no obliga-tion whatever to assist the Soviet Union in respect of the Baltic States until the political and military parts of the agreement had been signed and brought into force.13. The negotiation of the military part of the agreement will be a very difficult matter, and the military negotiations will probably not be brought to a conclusion until it can be agreed, for example, between the Soviet Union and Poland that the Soviet Union will have passage through at any rate a section of Polish territory in the event of a war in which Poland is involved on our side. This result will not easily be attained, and we may find ourselves for months in negotiation with Moscow without any concrete agreement being reached.14. Whether the continuance of this indeterminate situation would be better for us than a final breakdown of the negotiations now is a matter of high policy, but I think myself that it would. A break would create bad feeling. It would encourage the Germans to act. It might drive the Soviet Union into isola-tion or into composition with Germany. On the other hand, the fact that military conversations were in progress, although producing no immediate concrete results, would still probably worry Hitler. Russia would also be less likely to remain neutral or be on the wrong side in the case of war; and it would be easier to arrange for her military collaboration if she should decide to join us.15. There remains the question of a tripartite agreement limited to the case of direct aggression against a signatory. If we do not accept the Soviet view of article 6 you will realise that no such agreement can be reached, since the Soviet Government may be expected to stand out for a politico-military agreement in this case also; and a limited politico-military agreement would not, I think, be very much easier to negotiate than a politico-military agreement of wider scope, since the same kind of problem would arise. If we accept the Soviet view of article 6, and if we propose, as you suggest in your telegrams Nos. 160 and 162, that the limited agreement should contain a proviso for further negotiations for the extension of the agreement to other States, the Soviet Government may well ask why such negotiations could not proceed in parallel with the military conversations, since there is only one point now outstanding, namely, the definition of indirect aggression. In that event we should be in the position which we are in any case likely to reach if we still go on trying for the wider agreement, namely, parallel discussions on (1) the outstanding point or points in connexion with the political articles ofthe wider treaty, and (2) the military problems connected with that treaty.16. One final point. If we do start military conversations, and if it should be agreed that they are to take place in Moscow, it is desirable that we should send at least one officer of high rank to give them a start. The Russians will expect to be treated in the same kind of way as the French and not less well than the Poles. Ironside&apos;s visit to Warsaw has been prominently reported in the press here, and the Soviet Government would be offended if&quot; we did not send someone of the same rank here. The Military Attache is, I think, writing in this sense to the War Office by this bag.17.   The Ambassador has read this letter and agrees with it.
