TWBNTY-SEYENTH REPORT.Defence expenditure and the economic and financial problems connected therewith.BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic situation : and in accordance with these instructions we now submit the twenty ^seventh of these periodical reports. The report represents the general views of the committee, without attempting to express shades of opinion held by different members.2. The present report discusses the economic and financial questions involved in the increase in our defence expenditure contemplated in the budget for the current year, and in the decision to meet a large proportion of this expenditure by borrowing. We make recommendations to relieve the pressure of demand on the capacity of the investment industries, to mitigate the rise in prices generally, and to avoid the deterioration in our balance of overseas pay-ments, which may occur as a consequence of these events.(Signed on behalf of the committee) :STAMP, Chairman.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S. W. 1, July 20, 1939.[19636J
DEFENCE EXPENDITURE AND THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS CONNECTED THEREWITH.(a) Introductory.THE expansion of Government expenditure on defence gives rise to two distinct problems: (i) the adequacy of the potential output of the industries most concerned with the production of supplies for the defence programme, and (ii) the possibility of a general excess of demand over supply. Failure to meet these problems would disclose itself in a tendency for prices and individual money incomes to rise, in the case of (i) in a particular group of industries, and in the case of (ii) generally, and also for imports to&quot; expand and exports to contract.2. The date at which these problems become acute can be deferred in so far as resolute attempts are made to bring into production that part of our resources which is still unemployed. It is difficult for us to keep fully informed of what is being done in this respect; but we are of the opinion that certain parts of the Governments programme, especially those connected with Air Raid Precautions, should afford a field, if suitable ancillary steps as regards reconditioning, &amp;c, are undertaken, for the employment of certain types of unemployed labour which has hitherto been commonly written off, in discussions of the unemployment figures, as virtually unabsorbable. We believe, too, that in concert with the Trade Unions, plans for the utilisation of the labour of those who do not normally seek employ-ment in industry, especially, of course, of women, should be pushed forward with energy.3. Nevertheless, we believe that it will be necessary to bring into operation, possibly in progressive stages, a programme designed not only to increase the total of the national effort, but also to secure for the direct use of the Government, and for the essential purposes of the export trade, the greatest possible share of the effort so increased. In the course of our report accordingly we recommend the following courses of action : *(i) the rationing of the investment expenditure which firms and individuals in this country are permitted to incur, with a view to maintaining the capacity in the investment industries available for defence production and for exports (paragraph 15); (ii) the limitation of dividends and certain other income payments by com-panies and firms with the provision that undistributed profits, unless required to finance investment expenditure permitted under (i) above, and. unspent depreciation allocations should be invested in Government securities (paragraph 27); (iii) the stimulation of exports by all possible means, together with measures to relieve the pressure on our balance of payments and our shipping in the event of war, among which we would direct particular attention to the immediate purchase of additional reserves of imported food-stuffs and raw materials (paragraphs 30-34).4. &quot;We have endeavoured to check our conclusions where possible by statistical calculations bearing on the shortage of productive capacity which is likely to occur in the investment industries, and the excess of general demand over supply (or deficiency of savings). As might be expected these calculations lead to indeterminate results. The deficiencies at which we arrive are within the margin of error implicit in this form of calculation. On the other hand we would emphasise the two following considerations : (1) While aggregate figures of production and employment have their uses, they become progressively less illuminating as in one branch of production after another the limits of capacity are approached. It is on the emergence of specific and localised pressures and bottlenecks, which may be none the less crippling because they are difficult to establish statistically, that the case for some control of private investment activity in large measure depends. (2) The defence expenditure on which our arguments are based is that envisaged in the Chancellor of the Exchequers budget statement. Since that time further commitments have been entered into, for example, the pay-ment and equipment of the new militia.* Though it is conceivable that the present* This paragraph was written before the publication of the Supplementary Estimates and the Chancellor of the Exchequers speech on the third reading of the Finance Bill.
programme of expenditure might be carried through without recourse to the measures we recommend (though not without loss of exports), we think it would be ensured by them. And, inasmuch as the Government doubtless regard that pro-gramme as a minimum and desire the maximum peace defence programme, if the enforcement of these measures results in a capacity to produce beyond that minimum programme it will be to the advantage of all concerned. In other words our defence programme has nothing to lose but everything to gain by the adoption of remedies less drastic than those required in war, but appropriate to a time which we dare not regard as peace. It would be surprising indeed if adequate defence preparation could be achieved on top of the undisturbed normal economic activity of the country without special measures. We believe that the attempt to do so would produce dangerous repercussions on the price level and the balance of trade.(b) Defence expenditure and the investment industries.5. The greater part of the increase in defence expenditure since 1933 has been spent with the investment industries, which produce (and repair) buildings, plant, vehicles and machinery. We give below an account of the development of defence expenditure since 1933, and the proportion of this spent with the investment industries *Table 1.Defence expenditure since 1933.Fiscal Year beginning 1st April.

We have attempted to estimate the changes which have taken place in the output of the investment industries in the years 1929 to 1938, the quantity of investment goods available for use in this country after adding imports and deducting exports, and the balance available for purchase by industry and other buyers in this country after providing for the Government^ defence purchases. Our conclusions are set out in table 2 below. We should point out that, in order to eliminate the effects of variations in price, we have valued this output at 1930 prices throughout, so that the defence purchases do not correspond with those given in table 1. Further details of the calculations on which this table is based are given in the Appendix to this report. We have added estimates for the year 1939. There are two points which we should make with regard to these estimates -(i) Our estimate of the gross output of the investment industries in this country for the year 1939 is based largely on an anticipated increase in the numbers employed.  We have allowed something for an increase* Defence expenditure with the investment industries is arrived at from an examination of the Appropriation Accounts for the years 1933-37, and of the Estimates for the years 1938 and 1939. It includes the output of the Governments own factories and dockyards at home and the cost of research and inspection. It excludes expenditure on building abroad, and in dockyards abroad. Since 1937 the appropriate expenditure of the Air said Precautions Department of the Home Office is included in the totals. In default of estimates it has been assumed that in 1939 all the  9 millions to be spent on the protection of public utility services, and 70 per cent, of  50 millions of supplementary expenditure on the defence services allowed for in the budget statement will be spent with the investment industries.
in productivity, but nothing for an increase in the hours worked per week. If we could assume a general increase in hours worked from say 47 a week to 50, output would be increased by about  75 millions a year, at 1930 prices, (ii) We have allowed for a net export of  130 millions of investment goods. We have reached this figure by considering not what is likely, but what is desirable, and possible. The investment industries require considerable imports of raw materials. In most years their net exports of finished goods (exports less retained imports) rather more than pay for these imports. The relevant statistics are given in the Appendix. We believe that it should be possible to maintain this position by appropriate action; and if it is possible the present pressure on our balance of payments makes it most important that it should be done. Net exports of  130 millions are the smallest which could he said to meet this requirement. Even so the position would be substantially worse than in 1938, though rather better than in 1937.Table 2.Value of 1930 prices of the gross output of investment goods (free of duplication) in the United Kingdom together with the distribution of this output between net exports, production for defence, and home investment, for the years 1929-1938 with an estimate for 1939.(In &amp; millions.)Year.Index of price of investmentgoods, 1930=100.Gross output of investment goods free of duplication in the United Kingdom at 1930 prices.Net exports (exports. . less retained imports) of investmentgoods at 1930 prices.Investment goods available for use in United : Kingdom at 1930 prices.Investment goodsused in the defence programme at 1930 prices.Investmentgoods used in theUnited Kingdom forpurposes other than defence at 1930 prices.1929 ... 1930 ... 1931 ... 1932 ... 1933 ... . 1934 ... 1935 ... 1936 ... 1937 ... 1938 ...Estimates for 193999 100989493939496 1044 108110742 708 638 587 637 747 808 916 1,014 9851,129133 113 62 72 80 89 103 100 110 119130609 595 576 515 557 658 705 816 904 86699936 34 34 33 34 42 59 . 98 154 237407573 561 542 482 523 616 646 718 750 6295927. Though this table cannot claim any high degree of absolute statistical reliability, it will serve to indicate the general course of events, and in default of more accurate information we must use it to illustrate our subsequent argument. The points which stand out from it, are (i) the rapid development of the output of the investment industries, which in 1939 may be 50 per cent, greater in terms of volume than in 1929, (ii) the recovery in net exports since 1931, (iii) the extra-ordinary expansion in output for defence, and (iv) the fluctuations in home demand (other than for defence) for investment goods. The slump beginning in 1929 caused a reduction of  90 millions in home demand by 1932, a moderate reduction considering the severity of the slump. Between 1932 and 1937 there was an increase of  270 millions, due to the housing boom, the increased output of motors, and the expansion of ordinary industrial investment. Between 1937 and 1938 there appears to have been a decline of no less than  120 millions, attributable in part to a reduction of stocks of raw materials and semi-finished goods.  Normally this decline might have produced a serious slump, but its effects
were mitigated in 1938 by the expansion of defence demand. This decline in ordinary domestic demand, however, made possible a simultaneous expansion of defence expenditure and an improvement in the export surplus of the invest-ment industries, after paying for their raw material imports; of  42 millions compared with 1937.*8. We return to the prospective position in 1939. We have assumed net exports amounting to  130 millions at 1930 prices. In the improving circum-stances of international trade it should be possible to secure the necessary markets, provided that goods are available at the appropriate price. In view of the increased imports of raw materials for the investment industries which will be required for the increased production in 1939, and the existing strain on our balance of payments, we do not think that it would be safe to contemplate a smaller net export. But&apos;if the goods required for export are to be available, it will be necessary to confine ordinary home demand within the figure of approxi-mately  600 millions (at 1930 prices) given in the last column of the preceding table, for the balance of domestic output will be required for defence.9. At first sight this does not appear to be a very serious task. The contem-plated provision for ordinary home demand represents a reduction of  37 millions below actual demand in 1938. But, in fact, not all this output will be available for ordinary industrial and private purposes. There are five special factors to be allowed for : (i) Substantial exports of armaments will be needed for the use of those Powers with which we have recently concluded alliances. These exports will be financed by loans from this country and will in no way contribute to the balance of payments this year, nor in all probability to those of future years, (ii) As part of the general defence programme, a large programme of non-naval shipbuilding has been encouraged by the grant of Government subsidies. To a considerable extent this programme will represent an addition to ordinary domestic demand.(iii) The growing output of armaments involves increasing capital expendi-ture by private business in adapting; their works to armaments production. Some part of this expenditure is included in the Defence estimates, and, of course, expenditure of this character took place in 1938. Nevertheless, we should suppose that on balance the deduction from investment output available for ordinary purposes on this account will be greater this year than last year.(iv) Under the Air Raid Precautions programme, in addition to construc-tional expenditure financed by the Government, there will be considerable expenditure financed by employers and householders. This, again, is outside the boundaries of ordinary domestic demand, (v) A substantial part of the decline in the output of investment goods between 1937 and 1938 was attributable to a reduction of stocks of semi-finished products. The ordinary demand for finished investment goods probably exceeded materially the figure of  629 millions given in table 2 for 1938.We have no means of assessing these factors statistically, but we should not expect the true surplus of production of investment goods available to meet ordinary domestic demand to exceed  500 millions at 1930 prices, and we should not put the true comparable figure for 1938 below  650 millions. The effect of these modifications is, therefore, to make the comparison between 1938 and 1939 not that of  629 and  592 millions from which we started, but of  650 and  500 millions.10. Moreover, we do not consider actual demand in 1938 a true indication of the demand which may materialise in 1939. In 1938, owing to the depression of trade, there was a break in the expansion of output in industry generally, and this naturally led to a curtailment of new orders for machinery and equipment. This year there is every indication that general demand is expanding, as might be expected from the stimulus which heavy Government loan-financed expenditure provides. As output begins to&quot; exceed that for which provision has already been made, new orders for machinery and equipment will be received by the investment industries. In certain&apos; directions, however, notably in house-building, it is possible that the heavy investment which took place in the years 1933-37 will* See Appendix, Table B.
result in a prolonged reduction in demand below the level prevailing in those years. We do not, therefore, anticipate a return to the conditions of demand prevailing in 1936 and 1937, but rather to an intermediate position, represented perhaps by an output of between  650 and  700 millions at 1930 prices.11. The situation which we think may occur when the forces set in motion by the 1939 defence programme have taken their full effect, is that the investment industries will receive orders from ordinary domestic sources which will exceed by not less than  150 millions (at 1930 prices) their capacity to meet them, so long as they are producing the goods required for the defence programme, and for export. We think it is possible that a substantial part of this deficiency may be made good by such a reorganisation of man power as would enable longer hours to be worked in the investment industries. The contribution obtainable from this source may be of the order of  75 millions. Nevertheless, we should point out that when any group of industries is, working at high pressure, production tends to be interrupted by the existence of &quot;bottle-necks,&quot; and that this would result in practice in a considerable diminution of output below the theoretical maximum. Moreover, it must&quot; be remembered, first, that the working of additional hours increases costs, and secondly, that it would only be tolerated by those it affects if there is adequate psychological preparation, which might involve such emergency measures as we recommend as an almost essential preliminary.12. In view of the steps which the Government would no doubt take to secure the output which it requires for defence, e.g., the exercise of the powers of priority which will be conferred by the Ministry of Supply Bill now before Parliament, the competition engendered by this excess of demand over supply of the order of  75 to  150 millions, would be between production for export on the one hand, and production for the home market on the other. We should regard the probable consequences of this competition, namely, an increase of prices and costs in the investment industries and a reduction in the value of their exports, as so undesirable as to demand the strongest preventive measures.13. In these circumstances it seems desirable to take steps forthwith to ensure that domestic demand for the products of the investment industries is kept within the potential capacity of those industries, after defence orders have been met and an adequate quantity of exports secured. Indeed, restrictive measures may be required on such a scale as to produce an overall reduction of perhaps one-fifth in the domestic orders given to .the investment industries, and possibly a substantially greater reduction in those branches of the investment industries which produce for export. It may be necessary to encourage industry to postpone the renewal of plant due for replacement but still serviceable, as well as to prohibit new capital development of an unessential nature.14. The classical remedy for the situation which we have described would be an increase in.interest rates. We see the following objections to reliance on this remedy : (i) A substantial part of the demand for investment goods is financed not by borrowing, but through the undistributed profits of industry and through depreciation funds. These funds would scarcely be deflected by the offer of higher interest rates from the purchase of investment goods to the purchase of, e.g., Government securities, (ii) The investment industries where demand is most influenced by changes in interest rates are the building and constructional trades. Curtail-ment of demand at these points would release only a negligible capacity for export, (iii) The Government is itself the greatest borrower in the market to-day, and would have to bear substantially increased charges if it raised interest rates against itself.Tor these, reasons we conclude that quantitative control of domestic demand for investment, goods is essential.15. Quantitative control may be exercised either by giving priority to the production of goods which are urgently required, or by forbidding the production of goods which are not urgently required.. The courses open to the Government in the present situation are therefore (i) to extend the priority provisions which they are already, taking for their own requirements to production for export, and (ii) so to ration that part of home demand which does not deserve priority that adequate capacity is available for production for export.   It would be
4 fn f.desirable to proceed by both methods simultaneously. We are, however, of the opinion that the rationing of home demand must, in any event, form part of any scheme which the Government may adopt, for the following reasons : (i) A scheme based exclusively on priorities will not prevent competition for the use of that part of the capacity of the investment industries which is not earmarked for urgent purposes. Costs and prices in the free section of the industry will inevitably be affected by this competition. In the long run prices and costs throughout the industry will be deter-mined by conditions in the free section; and costs, probably of Government orders and certainly of exports, will rise seriously. It will be of little avail to reserve capacity for export orders if cost conditions in the industry make it impossible to secure these orders, (ii) A system of priorities will not prevent domestic demand which cannot be satisfied at home being transferred abroad. And the balance of payments will be just as seriously affected if imports are increased, as if exports are diminished. It might be possible to deal with the problem of imports separately. But it must be remembered that we are debarred from increasing duties on a wide range of engineering products, e.g., by our recent trade agreement with the United States, and from imposing quantitative limitations on imports which do not apply to home production by that and other trade treaties.In spite therefore of the fact that administratively it is much simpler to decide what is required and to give the necessary priorities, than to decide what is not required and to prohibit the consequent production, the latter course will have to be pursued.16. Though we place the greatest reliance on the control of investment activity through direct rationing, we do not wish to exclude the possibility of supplementing rationing on the physical plane by rationing or otherwise restricting the financial resources becoming available for the purchase of invest-ment goods. Administratively, this is probably a comparatively simple problem, and it might, by excluding at the source a number of projects of doubtful economic necessity, reduce the difficulty of direct control. The kind of measures which we have in mind are the discriminative control of new issues and other sources of new capital, and a moderate rationing of bank credit.(c) Government borrowing and the state of general demand.17. The demand for and supply of savings play a decisive part in deter-mining the level of the national income. If the demand for savings, under the influence for example of an increase in investment activity, is tending to outrun the supply, demand for consumable goods also tends to outrun supply, and there is a stimulus to increased production. Provided that the supply of money, is allowed to increase, this stimulus leads to an increase in the national money income, either through an increase in production or through an increase in prices and individual money income levels, or through a combination of these two. As the national money income increases, the supply of savings increases also.18. The critical point in this chain of cause and effect is the distribution of the induced increase in the national money income between increased produc-tion, on the one hand, and increased prices on the other. So long as there are substantial unemployed resources being brought into use, the greater part of the increase in the national money income is due to increased production; but as these unemployed resources diminish a larger and larger share, and eventually the whole, of the increase in money income is in the form of an increase in prices. So long as production of consumers&apos; goods can expand pari passu with the demand for investment goods financed by loan expenditure, equilibrium can be maintained. But an increase in loan financed. investment expenditure after that point eventually causes a vicious circle of rising prices, even though this may be postponed for a short time by the delay which occurs between the earning and spending of incomes.19. The decision to borrow some  400 millions in respect of defence expendi-ture in the current financial year raises the question whether savings are likely to expand enough to meet the fresh demands which will be put on them, and what will happen if they do not.   In the first place, what kind of reserves[19636] c
of productive capacity remain in the consumers&apos; goods industries? The unemployment figures provide some kind of answer. In 1938 there were approxi-mately 8 million insured persons employed in these industries and a further 1,100,000 or 1,200,000 unemployed; moreover, we can -assume some increase in the labour force in these industries, even after the increase of 140,000 which we have assumed for the investment industries. Not all the unemployed can be absorbed into industry, for a number of well-known reasons; but an increase over the 1938 average of 550,000 in the numbers at work in the consumers&apos; goods industries is perhaps possible, of whom perhaps 500,000 would be drawn from the unemployed. Indeed, there has already been a substantial fall in the numbers of the unemployed in these industries. We can further assume a material increase in output among those employed, so that an increase in the output of consumers&apos; goods of 8 or 10 per cent, is quite conceivable. The question is whether this increase of output and of incomes associated with it, together with the increase in incomes in the investment industries, is likely to produce the additional savings required to finance the increased borrowing due to the defence programme without a rise in prices.20. What in fact is likely to be the increase in savings required for this purpose ? We may begin our investigation of this question from the cost of financing the investment goods sold in this country, which may be estimated from table 2 above. It must be borne in mind, however, that personal savings are by no means the only source from which these purchases are financed. Other sources are rates and taxes, direct purchases out of income (e.g., house repairs and purchases of motor cars), depreciation funds, undistributed profits of com-panies, and in some years, a reduction in working capital outside the investment industries.* There are three other factors in addition to the cost of investment goods sold in the United Kingdom, which affect the demand for and supply of saving and similar sources of finance, for which annual figures are available. These are the budget surplus or deficit, the increase or decrease of the debt of the Unemployment Fund, and the import or export of capital. The variation of these three items since 1929 are given in the appendix.21. Combining these figures with those for net sales of investment goods in the United Kingdom, not at 1930 prices but at the prices prevailing in the year in question, a total is obtained of the finance required from the sources mentioned in the preceding paragraph.Table 3.Demand for finance for investment purposes in the years 1929 to i938 withan estimate for 1939.(In   millions.)Year.

It will be observed that in the years of depression the finance required for investment purposes declined very rapidly, and that when recovery began demands for finance increased until, in 1937, they had reached a level which, having regard to the increase in incomes and employment, was roughly equivalent to that of the year 1929. But, whereas in 1929 there was a substantial export of capital through a favourable balance of payments, in 1937 there was a substantial import of capital. For 1939 we have had to make assumptions as to the effect of &apos;&apos; other factors,&quot; namely, the budget surplus or deficit, the accumulation of capital by the Unemployment Fund, and the adverse balance of payments. We have had to have regard to the probability that internal conditions in this country will reflect a high degree of industrial activity. We have therefore assumed a substantial budget surplus, a large surplus on the Unemployment Fund, and an adverse balance of payments rather larger than in the last two years. Even so, we find that there will be an increase in the finance required for investment purposes of the order of  150 to  250 millions. The greater figure assumes a substantial increase in output in the investment industries through longer hours of work. This brings these requirements into a quite new region. We have to consider what prospects there are that they will be met.22. We have enumerated above the principal sources from which the demand for finance for new investment is met, namely, rates and taxes, direct purchases out of private incomes, depreciation funds, and personal savings. This last item should also be sub-divided into (a) those which are of a more or less contractual nature, and therefore unlikely to wary very much from year to year, and (b) those in respect of which the individual saver has a greater degree of initiative. It is clear that, though these sources of finance are all likely to be affected in some degree by an increase in the national income, they are likely to be affected in very different proportions. The sources which are not likely to prove responsive to a general increase in incomes are (i) - rates and taxes, and (if) personal savings of a contractual nature.. In the present connection we must also add (iii) direct purchases out of private incomes, for, although these might ordinarily be expected to increase with an increase in prosperity, this could only occur now if no restriction were placed on expenditure on house repairs and e.g., the purchase of motor cars, and, in that event, obviously no additional contri-bution would be made to the finance of the Governments defence programme. There remain as the elastic element in the supply of finance company depreciation allowances and undistributed profits, and the element of private savings which are not of a contractual nature.23. It is a matter of great difficulty to reach any quantitative estimate of the importance of these elastic elements in the supply of finance for investment purposes. To present some idea of the issues involved, we have had prepared for us an estimate of the total supply of finance in the year 1937.* Nearly every item of this may be open to argument, so that, though we have no prima facie reason to disagree with it, we are not in a position to endorse it without much more careful study than we have been able to afford. We are prepared, however, to accept as a tentative hypothesis the conclusion that the elastic element in the supply of finance was of the order of  450-500 millions in that year, and that not more than  100 millions of this was contributed by the non-contractual element in private saving.24. We have suggested above that an increase of production in the invest-ment industries of about 15 per cent, and in other insured trades of from 8 to 10 per cent, is possible. Allowing for a rather smaller increase in the non-insured trades we may assume an over all increase in the national income of 10 per cent, as the maximum that is possible without a rise in prices. If this is the case, and if the above sources of saving increase in the same proportion, there will be an increase of about  50 millions in the new resources for the finance of investment. This, however, is an unduly pessimistic view. For we may assume that a substantially larger proportion of an increase in income will be saved, or placed to reserve in the case of companies, than in the case of total income. Moreover, there is a lag between the time when incomes, especially incomes from profits, are earned and the time when they are spent.   Nevertheless, the total increase in profits, before depreciation allowance,[19636]* See Appendix, section (d).
but after deduction of income&apos;tax, &amp;c, is not likely to exceed  100 millions, for a 10 per cent, increase in output, having regard to the possibility of increasing costs, unless there is a rise in prices; and even if the whole of this increase is saved, and there is also a substantial addition to the flexible element in private saving, the total new resources for the purchase of investment goods are unlikely to be greater than  150 millions. There may, therefore, it seems, be a substantial deficiency between the financial resources available for the purchase of investment goods and the financial resources required, which may be anything up to  100 millions.25. This deficit will be made up in one or more of the three following ways : -(i) An additional influx of capital, through an increased adverse balance ofpayments ;*(ii) A reduction in supplies of working capital due to the impossibility of replacing stocks as they are sold; and(iii) An increase in prices at a faster rate than wages.&apos;An increase in prices at a faster rate than wages has the effect of increasing the profits earned by industry more than in proportion to the increase in turnover. As a much larger proportion of profits are saved than of any other element in income, the effect is to increase the proportion of the whole national income saved. . The larger the proportion of additional profits saved the smaller has to be the increase in the proportion of profits to total income in order to adjust the supply of saving to the demand, and the smaller is the rise in prices of goods produced in this country. Moreover, the amount by which our adverse balance of payments will be increased, through the excess of demand over supply in this country, will depend largely on the increase in prices here, compared with those abroad, which it entails. For these reasons the proportion of additional profits saved is of crucial importance. It determines both the rise in prices here, and the increase in our adverse balance of payments.26. Nevertheless, there are elements in the present situation which make it possible that a smaller proportion of increased profits will be saved than is customary. For one of the most compelling motives for companies to keep profits in the business is the need to finance new capital extensions. We have seen that owing to the pressure on the capacity of the investment industries it will not be possible to allow these capital extensions this year even on the reduced scale of a year ago. For that reason it may be found that businesses will pay out much more in dividends and place less to reserve than has hitherto been the case.27. For these reasons we are of the opinion that it will be necessary for the Government to consider immediate measures designed to limit dividend payments and to secure that undistributed profits and the like are as far as possible invested in Government securities. These, are measures which were adopted by Germany at an early stage in her rearmament programme. They have a double virtue. On the one hand they tend to reduce the rise in prices which would otherwise follow from inflationary expenditure. On the other hand, they facilitate the Governments borrowing programme, both directly, by providing a supply of new resources for investment in Government securities, and indirectly, by reducing the attractiveness of other forms of investment. An additional merit is that they may have a psychological effect in dissuading Trade Unions from demanding wage increases. The scheme, the consideration of which we recom-mend, might take the form of limiting all payments in respect of dividends, partnership withdrawals, sums becoming due under profit sharing agreements, and perhaps also salaries over a certain amount, to the average annual amount paid out in certain selected years; and of requiring all surplus profits, and all unexpended depreciation allocations, except as required to finance approved forms of capital expenditure, to be invested in Government securities. Special provi-sion would have to be made for developing concerns, as in the case of the Armaments Profits Duty, and also, perhaps, to permit a minimum payment on capital employed, even though this implied an increased dividend distribution. For the time being, conditions would have to be imposed for the sale of securities issued under this proposal, and on their use as collateral for loans.* Even though an adverse balance of payments is financed by an export of gold, and not by an influx of capital, this puts additional sterling resources into the hands of the Exchange Account, which are available for investment.
(d) The balance of payments.28. Our discussion hitherto has not been primarily concerned with questions of foreign trade. But it has emphasised at a number of points the strain which the policy we are now pursuing is bound to place on our reserves of foreign exchange. We need hardly emphasise the importance of adequate reserves of foreign exchange in the event of war. The need arises not merely in order that we may reinforce our warlike effort by purchases in neutral countries, but also from the strain which will be placed on the carrying capacity of our mercantile marine in the event of war by losses of tonnage, by the diversion of ships to military use, and, if ships are retained in commercial use, by diversion to longer routes or more distant sources of supply in the case of certain commodities because of enemy control of certain seas. The consequence of this strain is likely to be that we shall, in the event of war, be forced to concentrate our purchases of certain other commodities on the nearest markets, in order to obtain the best possible results from the available tonnage. This means, in effect, that we shall be forced to buy increased supplies of, e.g., wheat, in the United States even though our reserves of dollar exchange are low, and reduce our purchases of wheat in Australia, even though we have ample exchange available there.29. The conclusions which we draw from this analysis are two; first, that though we may be reasonably prodigal of our capital reserves in distant empire countries in time of peace, we must do all that we can to build up reserves of dollars before war breaks out; secondly, that any steps taken now which reduce the strain on our carrying capacity in time of war will alleviate the strain which will then develop on our exchanges.30. Our first recommendation is, therefore, paradoxically one which will place an immediate strain on our balance of payments, namely, that we should build up further reserves in this country of commodities which are bulky for their value and which therefore require considerable shipping space in time of war. One commodity of this character is grain, and we should like to see further additions to our stocks of grain by purchases from the more distant sources of supply, e.g., Australia and the Argentine. Our position would be eased by the transference of stocks from these countries to the United Kingdom, even though in view of the shortage of storage capacity in this country this led commercial buyers to accumulate part of their normal stocks in Canada and the United States. Another commodity of great importance in this respect is timber. It is likely enough that in time of war we shall not be in a position to import timber from the Baltic, and will be forced to seek supplies either from Canada or from the White Sea. This will put a heavy additional strain on our shipping capacity. Moreover, if there is a decline in house building in this country, and there is evidence of such a decline, stocks of timber may tend to decline. We therefore suggest that stocks of timber should be built up. Another commodity which is very cheap for its weight is iron ore, and there are other ores of which this is also true, e.g., lead ore and bauxite. In general we would urge that our shipping capacity should be used to the greatest possible extent now, in order to minimise the strain that will be placed on it in war. Moreover, there is much to be said for using some of our reserves of foreign exchange for this purpose now rather than in time of war, because prices are likely to be higher for the goods we import after war has broken out than they are to-day. If, as we are convinced, action should be taken along these lines, it is essential that it should be taken quickly.31. Our further recommendations relate to the expansion of exports. We have already suggested that adequate capacity should be reserved in the metal and engineering trades for production for export. A further direction from which relief might be sought is in the diversification of our exports. There is an unusual opportunity for this at the present time. As a result of recent political disturbances in Central Europe, there are a number of industrialists and skilled workers who have either already left or are anxious to leave their native countries. The industries in which these persons were employed had previously important export connections, in the case of Czecho-Slovakian industries often with the United States. In many cases they produced specialised products which have not hitherto been made in this country. And it is highly probable that if they could gather together their nucleus staff, they would be able to restart production in this country and regain their previous export markets, or in some cases produce
in this country goods which we have hitherto been compelled to import. The foreign industrialists in some cases possess a certain capital of their own, in other cases they would need capital. What is essential, however, is that industrialists seeking to set up business in this country should be allowed to bring with them the skilled labour force which they require. In general they would find it possible to secure the unskilled labour, which is in most cases the bulk of their labour force; but they naturally find it impossible to secure labour which is skilled in processes which have never been carried out here. If the key workers in question were allowed to enter this country, or if already in this country were allowed to work here, the effect would not be to diminish employment in this country but to increase it, as has already been found in those districts where refugee industries have been set up. -From the point of view of this country&apos;s balance of payments there are two advantages, first the initial import of capital, and, secondly, the more enduring gain of a new export trade.32. Another step which might be taken towards the diversification of our export trades is the promotion of exports in a large number of luxury consumption goods. In time of war it will not be possible,to allow the use of productive capacity and raw materials in the production of goods which are not essential to the life of the community. It follows that the only hope which the industries producing such goods will have of maintaining their organisation in being throughout a war would be by production for export. But it will not be possible for them to build up the necessary export connections at short notice. It is therefore to their interest as well as the country&apos;s that they should take all possible steps to secure export connections forthwith. This is an argument which might be used with advantage with the&apos; industries concerned.33. Just as it is desirable to anticipate our war import requirements in time of peace, there is much to be said for building up stocks of such of our exports as can be stored without losing value in or near the markets where they will-ultimately be sold. As in the case of forestalling imports this puts a present strain upon our balance of payments, for most exports require a substantial proportion of&apos; imported raw materials (though in some cases this raw material content could be financed by forward sales in the commodity markets) and storagecosts would also be payable in foreign exchange. But these stocks would afford a potential reserve of foreign exchange which could be drawn on in time of war, when export pro-duction might be difficult. In the meantime their manufacture would encourage production for export. The proposal the consideration of which we recommend is that the Government should undertake to pay for the finance and storage of stocks of approved British exports in foreign markets.34. We do not suggest that these are the only, or necessarily the most easily practicable, forms of support for our export trade. What we wish to emphasise is that every measure, however unusual, for stimulating production for export should be seriously considered at the present time. Even so it is possible that the present pressure on our balance of payments may be so accentuated by the increase in our defence expenditure that more fundamental remedies, in the direction of import and exchange control, may have to be considered. In the meantime, in anticipa-tion of this proving necessary, we recommend that the registration of our foreign assets, particularly of British holdings of American securities, should be put in hand forthwith.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W. 1, July 20, 1939.
APPENDIX.Notes on certain Statistical Estimates made in the course of the Report.(a) The Gross Output, free of duplication, of the Investment Industries in theUnited Kingdom, at 1930 Prices.1. The industries included as investment industries are those whose employment and unemployment are given under the following headings in the Ministry of Labour Gazette: Iron ore and iron stone mining; Lead, tin and copper mining; Stone quarrying and mining; Slate quarrying and mining; Clay, sand, gravel and chalk pits; Artificial stone and concrete; Cement, limekilns and whiting; Brick, tile pipe, &amp;c, making; Glass, excluding bottles and - scientific glass; Paint, varnish, red and white lead, &amp;c.; Pig iron; Steel melting and iron puddling, iron and steel rolling, &amp;c.; Brass, copper, zinc, &apos; tin, lead, &amp;c.; Iron and steel tubes; Wire, wire netting, wire ropes; General engineering, engineers, iron and steel founding; Electrical engineering; Marine engineering, &amp;c.; Constructional engineering; Motor vehicles, cycles and aircraft; Railway carriages and wagons, &amp;c.; Shipbuilding and ship repairing; Stove, grate, pipe, &amp;c, and general iron founding; Electrical wiring and contracting; Electrical cable, apparatus, lamps, &amp;c.; Handtools, cutlery, saws, files; Bolts, nuts, screws, rivets, nails, &amp;c.; Brass and allied metal wa,res; Heating and ventilating apparatus; Saw milling and machined woodwork; Wall paper making; Building; Public works contracting, &amp;c.2. The net output of these industries in 1930 we estimated by reference to the census of production of that year. The average numbers recorded as employed in the census of production exceed those recorded by the Ministry of Labour by an amount estimated in the census report at 5 - 9 per cent, for a number of reasons. In applying the census net output per head to the Ministry of Labour employment figures, an appropriate increase has been made to allow for this. On this basis the net output of the industries in question in the year 1930 amounts to  582 millions.3. These figures of net output are carried back to 1929 and forward to 1938 by the use of the appropriate groups in the Board of Trade&apos;s index of production, or by the use of employment figures. In view of the importance of increasing efficiency, and of fluctuation in working hours, indices of production have been used where possible. Employment figures have been used throughout for building and contracting and certain building material industries. In the case of engineering and shipbuilding, since 1936 the Board of Trade&apos;s index of produc-tion has become unreliable, as it does not reflect increases in naval shipbuilding and the production of aircraft. In the figures for 1937 and 1938 the net output of these industries has therefore been based on changes in employment since 1936.4. In order to convert net output into gross output, free of duplication, additions have to be made for imported raw materials, fuel and power consumed, and freight charges. Imports of raw materials at 1930 prices can be obtained from the revaluations of foreign trade prepared by the Board of Trade. An estimate of the cost of fuel and power consumed in 1930 can be made from the investigation conducted by the Board of Trade at the 1930 census of production, and carried forward by means of the production and employment indices. Transport charges can only be estimated roughly.5. In preparing our estimate of the potential output in 1939 we have made the following assumptions: -(i) that the number of insured persons in the investment industries shows a further expansion from 3,984,000 in July 1938 to 4,125,000 in July1939,............................(ii) that the average number of unemployed in the investment industries declines from 540,000 in 1938 to 450,000 in 1939, about the same as in 1937,(iii) that net output per head is  250, a little more than in 1937, hither to the best year, and(iv) that imports of raw materials, fuel and power costs and freight charges are proportional to the increase in net output.6. Our resulting estimates are shown in the following table, the last column of which appears in table 2 of our report.

Foreign trade in investment goods is shown in the following table. As our object is to indicate the net contribution of the investment industries to our balance of payments we have grouped this trade under three headings, net imports of raw materials, net exports of investment goods, and net exports of arms.Table B,Foreign trade in investment goods 1929-1938 at 1930 prices and as declared in &apos;s millions.Year.

(&apos;) Price changes have been estimated. * -Import surplus.It will be observed that the changes in the relative prices of our imports and exports since 1929 have, in general, worked out to our advantage, with the possible exception of the years 1933 and 1937.  Another point of great importance is the
improvement in our export surplus in investment goods in 1938 compared with 1937. This amounted to  42 millions, of which  28 millions are due to quantita-tive and  14 millions to price changes. This improvement was largely-attributable to the relaxation of the pressure of demand on the output of our investment industries on the part of home consumers other than the Government, result of the recession of home trade.(c) Subsidiary elements in the supply of and demand for saving.8. We have referred in pur report to three subsidiary elements in the demand for saving, namely, the budget surplus, the creation and repayment of debt by the Unemployment Fund and the import or export of capital. A total for these three items is given in Table 3 of the report. The following table gives an analysis of that figure : Table C.Subsidiary elements in the supply of and demand for savings 1929-1938.(In   millions.)Year.	Repayment of debt and capital import.

We attach hereto the statement which has been prepared for us of the sources from which the investment goods sold in the United Kingdom in 1937 were financed : (i) &apos;&apos; This enquiry must begin from the value of investment (and armament) goods produced by the investment industries for sale in the United Kingdom in 1937. This is given in Table 3 in the body of the report as  945 millions. This figure is based in the last analysis on employ-ment in certain groups of industries. It is clearly difficult to arrange that the products of a group of industries should correspond with estimates of certain sources of finance, and innumerable questions of classification are involved. It seems probable that, the estimate of output given above is based on a selection of industries which excludes more persons whose products are bought from the sources of finance considered below than it includes persons whose products are not so bought. The most important omissions are tyre production and certain classes of railway work. For this reason ah addition of perhaps  10 to  15 millions should be made.to the total of  945 millions given above. A further addition to this total must be made in respect[19636] d
of additions to stocks and working capital outside the investment industries in 1937. This may have been fairly substantial, say,  30 to  50 millions. The total finance required in 1937 was, therefore, from  985 to  1,010 millions, from which has to be deducted the finance provided from the subsidiary sources considered in Table 3 of the report, which amounted in that year to  212 millions, yielding a net figure of, say,  775 to  800 millions.Apart from personal savings there are four sources of finance to be considered, namely : (a) Rates and taxes. The principal expenditure financed under this heading is expenditure on roads, including both maintenance and new construction. This amounts to perhaps  50 millions a year, excluding loan expenditure. In addition, there are local authority sinking funds, perhaps  30- 40 millions, and a number of capital works financed out of revenue. The total cannot be less than  100 millions.(b) Expenditure out of current income. The important elements inthis sum are (i) the purchase and repair of motor cars, perhaps  50 millions, and (ii) house repairs, whether paid by occupiers or landlords, say  60- 70 millions. A further minor element is the purchase of wireless sets, bicycles and domestic machinery. The total under this heading is probably about  130 millions.(c) Depreciation funds of industrial and other concerns. Under this heading are the depreciation expenditure of the Post Office and the railways, amounting together to  55 millions, and the depreciation expenditure of other undertakings. The latter must include the &apos;&apos; wear and tear &apos;&apos; allowance under schedule D...........- (amounting to.  130 millions), and the remainder of repairs tolands and buildings under schedule A. There must also be a deduction for local authority depreciation included under (a) above.  The total may be put at  220 millions.(d) Undistributed profits of companies. The undistributed profits of .&quot;&apos; companies are generally estimated by reference, first, to theproportion of profits placed to reserve compiled regularly by the Economist, which in 1937 amounted to approximately one-third, and, secondly, to some estimate of total company profits. The procedure has many pitfalls. For example, it is not clear to what extent the sums put to reserve as compiled by the Economist are, or are not, net sums after reduction of tax. Having regard to the available information it seems possible that the total amounted to  150. This is to be taken as the net sum available after the deduction of taxes and net business losses, where they occur. A further sum of  15 millions may be added here for the reserves of building and co-operative societies, making a total of  165 millions.The sources considered in the preceding paragraph may therefore be estimated to make a contribution of  615 millions to the finance required for investment purposes, made up as follows :   millions.Rates and taxes ..........      ...      ....      ...      100Expenditure out of individual incomes       .......      130Depreciation funds     ...      ....      ...      ...      ...      220Undistributed profits  ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      165.   Total   ...      ... .   ...      ...      ... 615This leaves a balance of  160 to  185 millions as the contribution of private saving to the finance of investment in 1937. This sum again requires analysis. It must be increased by certain charges which have to be borne out of the savings of individuals, namely, death duties, stamp duties and brokerage and legal charges and the like. It must be diminished by certain contractual payments which from

These amounted to  107 millions in 1937. (v) &apos;&apos; The elastic elements in the supply of finance for investment (i.e., those which are likely to increase as a result of an increase in industrial activity and money incomes, and which are available for the purchase of Government securities) are depreciation funds and undistributed company profits and net private savings. According to the preceding calculation, these amounted in 1937 to  465 to  490 millions.&quot;the point of view of the individual are charges on his current income, namely, building society mortgage repayments, and life insurance premiums (together with the net interest earned on life insurance funds) and certain minor forms of saving, such as pension and health insurance funds.   The result is as follows :   millions.Estimated private savings        ...      ...      ...      160-185Add Death duties     ...      ...      ...      ......        90Stamp duties on capital transfer     ...      ...        15Legal and Brokerage Charges, &amp;c.
