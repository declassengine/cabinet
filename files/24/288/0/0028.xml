9-5 aA 0*General review SIR HORACE WILSON briefly explained the situation of the situation.about which the meeting had been called to give their advice.       He said that the foreign Office took a graveview of recent  events and of the manner in which the positimmight develop in the very near future. Reports werebeing received which pointed to the probability thatGermany would take early action at Danzig0     Itwas, of course, impossible to state whether that action would provoke counteraction by Poland.       A recent reportindicated that the first step might be taken on Thursdayor Friday next and would then be rapidly followed byother steps.It had been decided that the Cabinet should meet tomorrow, the 22nd August, and he (Sir Horace Wilson)had been asked to arrange that a report should be availableto the Cabinet at this meeting, which should indicatebriefly:-(i)       Whether all possible steps to improve our state of defence preparedness had been taken, short of instituting the Precautionary Stage.   -(Conversely had anything been done in the last few weeks which had the effect of reducing the state of our defonce preparedness e.g. movement of anti-aircraft batteries from their   war stations to practice camps).(li)       What essential measures would remain when(i) had been completed, which could notbe carried out Without instituting the precautionary stage.Hypothesis - SIR EDWARD BRIDGES asked what assumption should &quot;beGermany alone.made.as to our probable enemies?.SIR GEORGE MOUNSEY replied that, for the purposes of this immediate review, Germany alone should be regarded as our potential enemy.      There was evidence that Italy
was very hesitant, and it would he very much to our advantage not to take any steps which that country might misconstrue as &quot;being directed against her.Publicity. SIR HORACE WILSON said that in considering the publicity which such measures as might be taken would arouse, the general criterion should be   that the measures would show Germany that we meant business, but that they should not be of such a nature as to create alarm in this Country,Procedure. SIR EDWARD BRIDGES suggested that the meeting should go    through the measures listed in Appendix &quot;G&quot; to the Government War Book with a view to making recommendations to the Cabinet as to which of these measures should be put into force immediately.
ISCHEDULE I. Serial No.1.2.CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES! LISTED IN APPENDIX G OF government war BOOK,Preliminary measures for contx^ol Lave already &quot;been taken.      It remains for the WAR OFFICE to carry out certain further steps involving the manning of guns and the movements of troops from Ismailia. -he WAR office are talcing the necessary action and Cabinet approval is not required0The ADMIRALTY have completed the necessary action.3. The ADMIRALTY have taken such preliminary steps as, in their opinion, the situation demands, and they do not consider that any further steps are necessary at the moment.4. The WAR OFFICE have issued a preliminary warning to Commands to be prepared to call up these Key Parties immediately they receive orders.      If the manning of coast defence and anti-aircraft units is to be carried out quickly, it is essential that a preliminary&apos;- warning should be sent to the individual members of the Key Parties.Recommendation to the Ccbinet:-That the WAR OFFICE should be given:-(i)Authority forthwith to instruct Commands toissue warnings to all members of Key Parties of coast defence and anti-aircraft units to stand by,(ii) Discretion to issue the necessary orders for the Key parties to assemble when, in   their opinion, the situation requires that this should be done.
SCHEDULE I (Contd.). Serial No.5. (a)       The main reinforcements e.g. &quot;Heron&quot; and &quot;Emu&quot;- havealready moved.     Certain details, however,   still require to he moved, e.g. Field Companies , etc.     These minormoves can he cojra?iedcut without Cabinet authority and will be carried out by the WAR OFFICE   in-agreement with the, INDIA OFFICE after the FOREIGN OFFICE have consulted and obtained the agreement of the Egyptian Government.(b)       Aden and Egypt still require to be reinforced with Royal Air Force units from East Africa and Iraq respectively.    The AIR MINISTRY are desirous that these reinforcements should be carried out forthwith.     The FOREIGN OFFICE point out that this might have unfavourable reactions on Italy.Recommendation to the Cabinet:-That, on purely military grounds, it isdesirable to reinforce Aden and Egypt&apos; with Royal Air Force units from East Africa and Iraq forthwith.
SCHEDULE I (Contd.) Serial Mo.6. THE BOARD OF TRADE report that it would, be. very difficult to obtain any of these ships by chartering, and certainly not the full number required.      It would, therefore, be necessary to resort to requisitioning by Order in Council.It was agreed that there should be no question of requisitioning at this stage but that THE BOARD OP TRADE (Marine Department) should make discreet enquiries as to the availability  of this special class of shipping, with a view to being able to lay their hands on it at short notice, and should keep in touch with THE WAR OFFICE (who are also acting as the Agents of the AIR MINISTRY) as to their requirements.7. THE AIR MINISTRY are desirous of calling upthe whole of the Auxiliary Air Force forthwith.It was pointed out that a distinction was madelast September, when only the &quot;defence&quot; squadronswore mobilised, e0gD fighters and balloons.Recommendation to the Cabinet:- -That the Secretary of State for Air should raise at the Cabinet, on the 22nd August, the desirability of calling up the Auxiliary Air Force (including Balloon Squadrons) and the Air Force Reserve for Home Defence under two alternative proposals as follows(a) The &quot;defence&quot; squadrons only,(b) All squadrons.
&amp; (-.&apos;&apos; J.SCHEDULE I    (Oontd.)Serial No*8&apos;       Recommendation to the Cabinet:-That there is no need at this stage to institute the- Precautionary Stage locally in any of the Colonies, hut that the COLONIAL OFFICE should he given discretion forthwith to send &quot;Stand By&quot; telegrams to Colonial Governors as and where they consider necessary.9.

c$ ns jstiw     .xVSCHEDULE I    (Oonfd). Serial Ho,16* Tlie APIIIj..&apos;ALTY are in favour of ob Gaining cabinet authority to take action forthwith.      The BOARD OP TRADE pointed out that similar action, which was talc en last September, resulted in considerable claims being preferred against the Government, and on this account they would prefer that such action should not be taken until the Government decided that it was absolutely necessary. Such warning would be likely to arise to considerable publicity, and consequently to create alarm among the general public.It was accordingly agreed that the Cabinet should not be asked at this stage, to authorise advice to merchant shipping   generally against proceeding topotentially dangerous ports and waters, but should authorise such action in regard to ships vihieh are of special value, or which are carrying cargoes of special importance. 17.       Recommendation to the Cabinet:-That, the Secretary of State for Air should be asked to obtain authority from the Cabinet on the 22nd.
