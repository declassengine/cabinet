THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.1,     As provided in the Government War Book we beg to raise (1) the question as from what date National Registration is to be put into force and (2) the question of the use of the National Register returns for Rationing purposes.     The National Registration Bill was introduced into the House of Commons today.2.     With reference to (2), -we understand that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is recommending that rationing should be brought into force in three weeks from the present date.      If that course is approved, we agree, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy,  that National Registration returns could not be available in time to be used for the initial issue of Ration Books.     We understand, however, that it is agreed to be desirable that the rationing system should be linked up with the National Register system as soon as possible thereafter!    and we have taken this consideration into account in the following re commendations.3,     We think that there can be no doubt as to the case for a National Register.     It will assist the rationing system, provide machinery for the enforcement of conscription, replace the stale 1931 Census statistics with up-to-date man-power and general population statistics and will serve incidental purposes such as the preservation of contact between members of families dispersed by evacuation.E C R E T..P,192(59).CABINET..NATIONAL REGISTRATION.Memorandum by the Minster of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland.
4.     Compilation of the National Register cannot he indefinitely deferred without risk of deterioration in the present state of readiness of the preparations..     We understand, moreover,  that the use of the National Register for conscription purposes depends upon its readiness for the earliest stages in the conscription procedure.     We recommend accordingly that National Registration Day should he fixed for the Friday in the fifth week from the present date,  viz. the 6th October..5.     This should allow the lapse of a fortnight or more between the filling up by the public of the application forms for Ration Books and their filling up of the National Registration returns.(Initialled)     W.E.E.J a C .3rd September, 1939.
