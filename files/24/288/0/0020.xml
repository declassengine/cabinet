German Aircraft Industry.Memorandum compiled by the Industrial Intelligence Centre [Department of of Overseas Trade) in collaboration with the Air Staff (Intelligence).1. Output in December 1938.OUR last report, dated the 1st February, 1939, estimated the monthly rate of production of the German aircraft industry at the end of December 1938 at: About 850-950 airframes of all types,About 1,900 aero-engines of all types, and about 650 complete aircraft of first line types only.The total labour employed on this output was estimated at 197,050, exclusive of labour employed on semi-manufactures, repairs, and the manufacture of instruments, accessories, armament and W/T equipment.2. Activity January-June 1939.It seems certain that during the first months of the year an attempt was made, doubtless at the instigation of the Ministry of Economics, to reduce expenditure on armaments production, aircraft included. It is, however, equally certain that the Air Ministry refused to co-operate in any such reduction. On the 1st March, Field Marshal Goring declared that Germany&apos;s advantage in the air must be maintained and that &quot; we must produce aircraft in numbers and in quality thatseem unimaginable.....   The Air Force demands this year another giganticand powerful effort.&quot; In any case, the international reactions to the events of the 15th March and after must have been enough to ensure that there was no downward modification in German policy as regards aircraft production.So far as can be judged, output has, in fact, again risen somewhat, though not greatly, over the previous figure.3. Output in July 1939.Appendices I and II summarise the collated information available from all sources regarding the activity of the individual aircraft factories as at the 1st July. From these it would appear that the monthly rate of output of the whole industry may now be estimated as follows : Airframes of all types about 1,000.Complete aircraft of first line types only about 725-750.Aero-engines of all types about 2,200.The labour employed on this output, exclusive as before of labour employed on semi-manufactures, &amp;c, is estimated at: On airframes..................      149,000On aero-engines       ...      ...      ...       ...      ...        53,700Total labour ............      202,700During the last six months, reliable information regarding the factories has been more than usually difficult to come by, the German authorities having permitted very few official or unofficial visits to factories. While, therefore, a somewhat larger margin of error in the above estimates must be allowed for and the figures given may be on the conservative side, it is believed that no substan-tially greater output has been achieved and that certain very much higher totals reported in some quarters may be discounted.4. Changes in Types.Output during the last six months was expected to be adversely affected by type changes believed to be impending in some of the principal factories. Either because the new types proved after all unsatisfactory or because policy required that the flow of production should not at the present time be interrupted, the industry appears to be for the most part continuing the production of established types in modified or improved form.[F.C.I. 131][LC.F./148, dated 14.7.39.JENCLOSURE TO ANNEX.
5. Extension of Capacity.We remarked in our last paper that the main plan of factory construction in the aircraft industry seemed to be completed, at least temporarily. There has been no reason during the last six months to change this view. The laying down of no new factories has been observed, though some existing factories are being extended and the equipment of the newer ones completed.An extension of the Reich&apos;s productive capacity has, however, resulted from the passing of the former Czech aircraft industry under German control. Though potentially valuable the industry was not large. It comprised nine airframe factories and seven aero-engine factories, but the total labour employed was only about 12,000 and the average total output of military types in 1938 hardly exceeded 45 per month, a figure easily surpassed by several individual factories in the Old Reich. In any case none of the types produced is in use in the German Air Force.It seems probable, therefore, that, for the present, the former Czech aircraft industry is of value to Germany principally as a supplier on a small scale of components, aero-engines and labour, and for the rest that it will be encouraged to export. Its reorganisation and re-equipment to enable German types to be produced is not likely to result in any significant output before 1940. For this reason the factories concerned are not included in the Appendices.6. Labour.Whereas some reports indicate extra shift working, particularly at factories producing major components and in the aero-engine industry, the general practice seems to be to work one shift, though it has to be admitted that our information on this subject is not wholly conclusive. On the other hand, it is thought that immediately available supplies of labour would not allow any rapid general increase to be made in the number of shifts worked. Evidence of this is to be seen in reports of factories working a seven day week, or a six day week of as much as 60 hours, and in the much increased percentage of female labour.To some small extent the transfer of labour from the former Czech aircraft factories is relieving the situation.7. Mobilisation Planning.The mobilisation arrangements reported to have been made at one factory during the crisis of last September seem to indicate that labour plans for the contingency of mobilisation have been worked out in detail in the aircraft industry. At this factory, employing about 7,000 men, only 500 were earmarked to be called up for military service, while in fact only 150 actually left the factory.8. Limiting Factors to Expansion in War.In our last paper we stated our conclusion that, owing mainly to labour difficulties, it would not seem possible for Germany in emergency rapidly to double, still less to treble, her then monthly rate of output, and that, in the first few months of war, output of complete aircraft of first line types would be unlikely to exceed 1,500 a month.Information received during the last six months does not lead us to modify this view. Not only is labour still a serious limiting factor to any rapid expansion of output, but there are also grounds for thinking that there would be great difficulties in speeding up aero-engine production to the same proportionate extent as airframe output. The supply of certain aero-engine components, particularly gears, seems to have fallen behind schedule during the last six months. On the other hand, the considerable reserve of engines which must have been built up would to some extent mitigate the effects of this factor.If, however, the above maximum figure of 1,500 first line types is correct, it must be noted that, since the first line strength of the German Air Force is now believed to be about 4,000, the monthly productive capacity of the industry is below the 50 per cent, of first line strength at which we have hitherto believed the Germans aimed at maintaining it.    It would appear, therefore, that the[19677] b 2
Germans must be relying upon a considerable reserve of aircraft to tide them over an initial deficiency period of perhaps three months while extra labour is being drafted into the industry from elsewhere.Conclusions.It may therefore be concluded that: *(a) The monthly rate of output of the German aircraft industry should at present be reckoned at about 1,000 aircraft of all types, of which from 725-750 are first line types, an increase of about 15 per cent, as compared with six months ago.(&amp;) The personnel employed in the airframe and aero-engine industry, excluding those employed on semi-manufactures, repairs, and the manufacture of instruments, accessories, armament and W/T equipment, is probably about 203,000.(c) The present output is being obtained on a one-shift basis in most factories, but many are working overtime and some up to 58 or even 60 hours a week, and seven days a week. Extra shifts are being worked in some component factories and perhaps some of the engine factories. It is probable that shortage of labour makes it in general difficult or impossible to work extra shifts; the proportion of female labour is increasing.id) No new factories are known to be under construction, though the extension and equipment of existing ones continues. The former Czech aircraft industry, whose maximum monthly output last year hardly exceeded 45 aircraft of military types, represents a potentially valuable increase in the Reich&apos;s capacity. It is, however, unlikely to achieve any substantial output of German types before 1940.(e) Apart from possible difficulties in aero-engine production, labour appears to continue to be the principal limiting factor to rapid expansion of output in emergency It is thought unlikely that at present the output of first line types which Germany could attain in the first few months of war could exceed 1,500 a month, or under 40 per cent, of her first line strength.

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1939.SECRET.Copy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 370th Meeting, held on July 27, 1939.(10)-GERMAN   AIRCRAFT   INDUSTRY.(C.I.D. Paper No. 1569-B.)(Previous reference : U.I.D. Minutes of the 353rd Meeting, Minute 4.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries, covering a Memorandum prepared by the Industrial Intelligence Centre and the Air Staff (Intelligence) on the German Aircraft Industry (C.I.D. Paper No. 1569-B).SIR QUINTIN HILL, Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries, said that the conclusions of the Report were summarised in paragraph 8.  During the last six months, monthly production in German Germany had increased as follows : January 1939.        july 1939.Airframes       ...      ...      .... 850-950            1,000Aeroengines    ...      ....      ... 1,900              2,200Complete aircraft of first-linetypes         ....      ...... 650 725-750aircraft production.Continuing, SIR QUINTIN HILL said that the limiting factor in increase in production in Germany was labour. Broadly speaking, the industry was on a one-shift basis, but long hours were worked in many factories. The production of air frames might expand to 1,500 a month as a maximum in war,SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that the information at the disposal of the Air Ministry also went to show that the majority of aircraft factories in Germany were on a one-shift basis, and would be able to increase production considerably in war. The plans of the Air Ministry had been drawn with the object of bringing our own industry on to a one-shift basis by the end of 1939, but the inevitable delay in the production of new types in this instance, very heavy bombers-had appeared. This was prejudicing the Air Ministry plans, since they might Great Britain, have to place stop-gap orders for existing types.We had not yet as many workpeople engaged on production as the Germans, but he had no anxiety over our efforts in this direction. Every month saw a rise of some 5-7 per cent, in the amount of labour engaged. He enquired whether the German figures included sub-contracting labour.[19718-Number of shifts worked : Germany.Number of shifts worked:
Mr. MORTON confirmed that sub-contracting labour was excluded.In reply to Mr. Hore-Belisha, SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that he could not include comparative British figures in these reports, since he was not responsible for their production, but he agreed to bring the necessary figures to Meetings at which the Reports were discussed.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : To remit the Memorandum on the German Aircraft Industry (C.I.D. Paper No. 1569-B), together with the Minutes of the discussion in the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence, to the Cabinet for information.&apos;.V -iv ot&quot; -A- -at&quot; &quot;A^Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1, July 27, 1939.
