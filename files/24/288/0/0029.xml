SUMMARY OF CABINET CONCLUSIONS Oil C.F.  179(39).THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a summary of Cabinet Conclusions on War Book and other measures to improve defence preparedness as set out in CP. 179(39) (Paper No. D.M.(39)3).The following are the particular points arising out of this summary on which the Committee reached conclusions.-SCHEDULE I.Serial No. 4.     Coast Defence and Anti-Aircraft Units, etc.CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE took note.-(1) That the Secretary of State for War had already issued the necessary telegrams to assemble Key parties of all Coast Defence and Anti-Aircraft Units forthwith.(S) That the iffar Office were in (consultation with Commands about the despatch of telegrams to call up the remainder of the personnel for Coast Defence and Anti-Aircraft units, and that, having regard to all the factors involved the Secretary of State for War proposed to authorise the despatch of   these telegrams tomorrow.Serial No. 5.   Reinforcement of Garrisons in Malaya,Aden and Egypt.Army Reinforcements.CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE AGREED;-(3) That the Secretary of     State for War should be authorised to move a further Battalion from Palestine to the Sudan forthwith, after consul-tation with the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(4) That the move of a further brigade from Palestine to Egypt need not be carried out forthwith, but that the Secretary of State for War should be authorised to give the order for this move at his discretion, after consultation with the Secretary of state for the Colonies.
20 ST)SCHEDULE I.   (Contd.)R. A. F.  iceinfo rcements.COHCLUSIOHTHE COMMITTEE took note:-(5)    That the Secretary of State for Airwould consult the Secretary ofState for India about the despatchof a squadron from India to Basra,to replace the squadron which hasbeen moved from Basra to Aden and that Jue would make arrangements for xne move if the Government or India agreed.Serial No0 6,-   Requilrition of uamL5initcd Quantity  f Shipping&quot;an&quot; antTcipTi.on of Army and Air Force Requirements.CONCLUSION.THE COMMITTEE r,o.-k note:-(6)    That tho Board of Trade were obtaining the necessary requisitioning powers by Order-in-Council.Serial Ho. 8.      Institution of the Precautionary stage in Certain Colonies-A discussion took place about tho authority which 12ie Cabinet had given to the Secretary of State for the Colonies3&quot;to send supplementary telegrams to certain selected Colonies,  such as, for example, Malta and Hong Kong, authorising Governors to take unobtrusive action on the assumption that Italy and Japan respectively might be regarded as potential enemies.&quot; It was pointed out that the intention underlying this instruction had been that Governors should not take action which could be interpreted, by Italy and Japan as being provocative.     The feeling of the Meeting was that it would be wrong - particularly in the case of Malta - to refrain from taking measures fr*r the defence of the civil population commensurate with the measures which were already being taken in the military sphere to reinforce the garrisons.
29* 9SCHEDULE I.   (Conta,)In support of this,  SIR GEORGE MGUNSEY sail thatthe Foreign Office were now less anxious about woundingItalian susceptibilities,  in view of more recent information which made it clear that the italians were under no misapprehension about our feelingstowards them.CONCLUSION.THE COMMITTEE agreed:-(7)    To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to inform the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the views expressed      -dihe Meeting&apos;
9 *ji I&amp; tJ &apos;kSCHEDULE I (Contd.).Serial Ho. 12.     Hong Konp;:  evacuation of non-combatants.SIR GEORGE HOUHSEY said that urgent telegrams had been sent to our representatives at Shanghai, Tientsin and Tokio asking them to submit their views regarding the evacuation of British civilians from China.     Replies had not as yet been received, but past indications  pointed to the fact that there woiild probably be considerable opposition.     He suggested that it would be preferable to await the replies to these telegrams before&apos;taking action.LIAJOR GEHLRAL FQWHALL said that the General OfficerCommanding Hong Kong was insistent that all families, both military and civil, should be evacuated as &quot;soon as possible from Hong Kong.MR. MORRISON said that according to the Government War Book,  (Schedule I, Serial Ho. 12),. the scheme for the evacuation of non-combatants from Hong Kong in an emergency had already been prepared, and that the successful operation of this scheme required that the Governor should be warned at an early stage, in order to make the necessary local arrangements and to obtain adequate shipping.There was general agreement that, whatever might be decided about the evacuation of families already in Hong Kong, steps should at least be taken to prevent the departure of any further civilians to that Colony. COUCLUSIOHS.THE COMMITTEE   agreed:-(8) That the decision on the evacuation of non-combatants from Hong Kong should be postponed for further consideration until:-(i) A resume&apos; had been submitted by theForeign Office of the views of our representatives at Shanghai, Tientsin and Tokio.
(ii) The Colonial Office had submitted aiaeraorandum setting out the scope of the H ong Kong evacuation plan and its urgency in relation to local c ircumstances.(9) That all Departments should he invited to take step&apos;&quot;- to prevent the departure from now on of any farther civilians to Hong Kong0Serial No. 16.     Advice to Merchant Ghiip-oina&apos;* CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE took note:-(10) That the Board, of Trade were taking the necessary steps to issue warnings to merchant shipping, and that they had up to last night,,issued notices to 160 ships.Serial No, 16. prohibition of Eaport of Essential Goods. CONCLUSIONS,THE COMMITTEE took note:-(11) That the Minister of Supply was taking thenecessary steps to prevent the prohibition of export of essential goods,SCHEDULE II.Serial No. 10.    Requisitioning of Shipping.The discussion under this heading brought out the following points:-(i) The Arming end Commissioning of 35 Merchantmen.The full plan for the arming of merchantmen included 74 ships which had all been earmarked.     The Admiralty were desirous of arming 25 of these ships forthwith - 13 in Home waters end 12 abroad.     These 25 ships were, in the opinion of the Admiralty, vital to the defence of our trade routes.     The Germans had a dangerous start on us in having already prepared a large number of merchantmen which could be armed at very short notice .       It would take
9 **h) in jj)6 weeks to fit the 25 ships required by the Admiralty and every day&apos;s delay would correspondingly add to the risk to which our merchant shipping would he exposed in the event of war being declared before they were ready, The conversion of these ships would involve the mounting of guns and the scrapping of a certain amount of passenger accommodation, to an .extent which meant that they could not be reconverted in less than 6 weeks.      It would result in considerable interference with trs.de.     Pone of the 25 ships was at present unemployed, end their requisitioning for this purpose would inevitably become public knowledge very quickly,     Under article   9   of the Naval Treaties, it was Illegal to carry out such conversion in time cf peace, Duo the Legal Advisers to the Foreign Office were of the opinion that these objections could be surmounted by corainissioning the ships before their conversion was begun.-. CONCLUSIONS.TEH COMMITTEE agreed: -(12) (n)   That having regard to  the considerable risk which would attend our merchant shipping on trade routes if war were declared within the next 6 weeks/, the First Lord of the admiralty should be authorized to requisition 25 ships forthwith for the purpose of their&quot;being prepared for commissioning and arming as merchant cruisers..,(b)   That the Foreign Office should advise as to how this step might be carried out within the letter of the law.(ii) 55 Doe? Sea Trawlers., for Anti--submarine wo rk.It was pointed out that there was no shortage of deep sea trawlers, which were actually in excess of t r ade re qui rement s u CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE agreed: -
9 t -&quot;&quot;j hi tJ 4&apos;(15) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should he authorised to requisition forthwith, 55 deep sea trawlers for anti-submarine work.(iii)  gQ Steamers.for fitting out as Q boats.&quot;conclusions..   THE COMMITTEE agreed: -(14-) To &quot;withhold, authority, for the present, for the requisitioning of the 20 steamers required by the Admiralty for preparation as Q boats.
9.9-a   t? 6SCHEDULE III.Serial No. 4.      Government Evacuation Scheme for civil Population.SIR JOHN ANDERS ON said,  that in accordance with the decision taken at yesterday&apos;s Cabinet Meeting, he had been in consultation with the  1*0 0C:. Educational Committee.      The latter had pointed out that the evacuation scheme applied, in the main, to school children, and were emphatic that its effectiveness depended on the presence   Gf school machinery.  The present position was that in London - and also c&apos;7o:a a- &apos;;-o-..)d- part of England - this machinery was absent, and to--id not be put into operation until next Tuesday., owing to the fact that the children and school teachers were away on their holidays.      The Lef)*Co   Educational Committee were emphatic that any attempt to put the scheme into operation in the absence of the school teacher would result in a serious breakdown.      Sir John Anderson said that he was not pressing at this stage to seek a decision from the Committee, but he had considered it desirable to bring the position to their notice, against the possibility of his having to come back to the Committee for their advice at a later stage.CONCLUSION.THE COMMITTEE took, note:-(15) of the dlfficul ties of&quot; evacuatingschool children from London before the return cf the school children next Tuesday, as described by the Lord Privy Seal, and invited him, in the event of further doubt or difficulty, to ha^e no hesitation in requesting the Committee to meet later at short notice in order to advise him,  if necessary, on thisPoint-        ...8...
2ST- PiSerial No. 6.      Array Mobi 1 isation.MR. HORE BELI8HA summarised the requirements in respect of mobilisation as follows:-(i)    5s0OO men were required immediately to reinforce garrisons overseas.     Those couldj if nece be obtained by calling up Section A of the Reserve as being the only Reservists liable for service abroad. Section A would provide some 6S000.     This9 howevers was not a satisfactory method of finding these requirements and he would prefer to call up under the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Act such numbers of Reservists from all Reserve Sections as &quot;would enaoTe him to release regular soldiers serving at home for despatch overseas, (ii)   The present calls on the Army for the protection of vulnerable points had resulted in the diversion.,of-3-5^000-jaiilitiamen to these duties.     The original intention had been that these duties should be carried out by the National Defence Companies.     The terms of service for tnese Companies had nots however,, proved sufficiently attractive s with the result that they were not in a position to undertake the duties for which it was proposed to raise them.      The consequent mis-employment of militiamen was undesirable and detrimental to the efficiency of the Army in that they were not receiving the military training which they should.
Mr. IIore-Belisha accordingly suggested that the Territorial Field Army should he embodied9 so that a. part of them could undertake the protection of Vulnerable Points and so release the militiamen now engaged on this to their proper duties, (iii)    The Army at this moment required 1109000men to bring the various contingents of the Regular Field Force up to war strength. The resources from all Reservists would provide a total cf 170 sOC0 and of this number he sought immediate authority to call up 11.0s000 men.CONCLUSIONS.After considerable discussion TEE COMMITTEE; agreed -(16) that the Secret ry of State for Ear shouldhave authority to call up under the Reserve and Auxiliary Force Act sufficient men from all sections of the Regular Army up to a maximum of 6 s000 men in order to enable the overseas garrisons to be brought up to full strength,(17) (a)  that the Secretary of State for Ear should be invited to provide the Minister for Go-ordination of Defence with an itemised statement showing the details of the 110s000 men required to bring the various contingents of the Regular Field Force up to war strength.(b) to invite the Minister for Co-ordination^ofDefence to submit the statement   mentioned in (a) above to the Prime Minister for his decision as to whether the Secretary of State for war should be authorised to call up these 110 s000 men.Subsequent to the Meeting,the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence received details regarding the allocation of the 1105000 men in question from the Secretary of State for War and explained them to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister decided that in present circumstances it was not desirable to call out so many men in addition to those already -authorised (see Conclusion (2) and (16) above).     The Prime Minister stipulated., however that this decision should be borne in mind from day to day9 as the ihtrcmottoixE].    situation developed//
(c)  &apos; that in bringing this matter to the notice of the prime Minister for his decision the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact of the present disparity between the extent of the mobilisation authorised for the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force compared with that of the Arrrry.Serial No. 7.    Air Force mobilisation.CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE agreed(18)    that the Secretary of State for Vfr should, be authorised:- *(a) to call up by individual noticesunder the 1939 Act 21,000 Regular Reservists to fill vacancies in the Regular Air Force.(b) to call up 3s000 Volunteer Reservists(out of a total of 12s900)  to fill vacancies as crews of aircraft

He wished now to be authorised to extend the fitting to ships on other routes.

Serial Ho.  r6r- ...Powor to regulate traffic in ports.TnH Fj.H isi Sj-i  LOi-Lj sa.ici tiiat he assumed til at tois power would be available when the Pmiergencv Powers (Defence) Bill had been passed.SIP EDWARD BRIDGES said that so far a a he was aware there had as yet been no decision whether the Defence Regulations should be issued as soon as the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill had been passed into lav;.      Under existing machinery the Regulations were divided into three groups, the intention being to issue the Regulations in any particular group en bloc.     It would be extremely difficult to issue individual Regulations without issuing the remainder o:: the group in which they were included.      If,  therefore, Departments required the immediate issue of certain regulations,  they should ensure that their representative-on the War Legislation Committee was in full possession of their re. uirements, and of the degree of importance which they, attached to the issue of these regulations.COhCLUSIQII.THE COMMITTEE -(25)    (a)      Toon note that the power to regulate traffic in ports would depend upon the issue of a Regulation under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill.(b)      that in view of the undesirability,if it could be avoided, of departing from the- pre-arranged &quot; machinery for the issue of Defence Regulations in grouws, the Admiralty should re-consider the urgency of this item and issue the necessary instructions.to their representative on the War -Legislation Committee.

He wished to aslc the Australian Government for permission to retain this Cruiser in the Caribbean Sea until armed merchant cruisers were ready to take its pla.ce.
