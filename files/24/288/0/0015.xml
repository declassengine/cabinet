MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCEa1.     The Minister of Supply, the Chancellor of the Duchy and I have had under review ths size of the Government reserves of Food and Raw Materials, particularly with reference to the representations received from Sir Arthur Salter, M.P.s Mr. L.S. Amery, M.P. and the Bulletin recently published by the Air Raid Defence League entitled &quot;Food in War Time&apos;&apos;02.     The proposals put forward from these and other quarters are,sin effect^ that the Government should at once bring to this country the maximum quantity for which shipping space can be found of food and raw material of kinds which would be required in time of war,partly with a view to adding to our war reserves which are described as &quot;utterly inadequate&quot;, but also with the object of saving shipping tonnage once hostilities have begun.3.     So far as raw materials are concerned, the policy hithertofollowed has been to accumulate in this country reserves of essen-tial materials estimated to be adequate with trade stocks, tosafeguard the position for six months and upwards, that is to saysufficient to cover the position for the first year of a war,allowing for interruption of normal supply according to the sources from which the materials in question are imported.    In thecase of food supplies, the object has been to build up Government reserves which, with commercial stocksa would ensure that on the outbreak of hostilities we had at least three months&apos; supplies in this country, mainly to cover a period of shipping or transport dislocation due to air attack.4*     We have now reviewed the size of the Government reserves and considered to what extent they might wisely beincreased so as to save shipping tonnage on the outbreak of hos til it jes,-1-
5.      Our present review has heen restricted to a short-range policy, i.e, to what extent additional reserves of raw materials and food over and above those already authorised could be pur-chased by the Ministry of Supply and the Pood (Defence Plans) Department respectively to arrive in this country not later than the 15th October next.    We have not attempted to examine this problem from the point of view of what might be accomplished in this direction by the adoption of a long-range policy which would take two or three years to carry through, including the building of additional storage accommodation.    We consider, however, that a careful review of our long-range storage polby should be made in the coming Autumn. RAW MATERIALS.6.     Approval has recently been given to several purchases on a large scale which represent a considerable demand on shipping, e.g. American cotton - 600,000 bales or about 150,000 tons; iron ore - 1, 000,000 tons;    phosphate rock - 100,000 tons; copper - 40,000 tons;    hemp 17,000 tons;    pitprops - 120,000 (if available).    It is by no means certain that circumstances will permit the shipment of these quantities before 15th October, but except for iron ore a substantial proportion of them should have been received by then.As regards further purchases for delivery by that date, it will be appreciated that in general production is dictated by consumption and that any expansion of production is a gradual process.   Prom a short-term view, therefore, it is probable that any rapid purchases for reserve could only be at the expense of normal commercial deliveries.    There are, however,certain commodities in respect of which. Government purchases could, prima facie,     be made within a
reasonably short period without dislocating normal commercial supplies or causing undue increase in price. These are set out in Annex I, but the dates by which shipment could be completed cannot be stated with any confidence at this stage.     Moreover, detailed enquiries into the commodities suggested may bring to light technical or commercial obstacles to rapid addition to normal shipments.      Commodities for which it is reasonably certain that no supplies could be obtained in the near future are not included.As regards storage, it is not anticipated that severe difficulties will arise, the commodities in question either could be stored in the open or in accommodation which can in the nature of the case be of a more improvised kind than is possible in the case of foodstuffs.Attention has been confined in the list in Annex I to bulky commoditieso      There are however a number of other essential materials, not representing individually a large demand on shipping, purchases of which, if found desirable and practicable on further examination, might in the aggregate secure a saving of shipping space worth consideration.POOD SUPPLIES.In the case of food supplies, the principal factor which limits what can be accomplished between now and the 15th October is storage accommodation in the United Kingdom, For bulky commodities, such as wheat, other cereals and sugar, there are no vacant stores.      On the other hand, for reasons of cost, none of the Government food reserves so far purchased require cold storage.     There, are a large number of cold stores in the United Kingdom which at the present time are only being used to about one-third capacity and we are of opinion that some use should.now be made of these stores.
7. We have examined the possibility, having regard tothe factors referred to in the previous paragraph;,  of obtaining the maximum additional supplies of &quot;both raw materials and food by the date mentioned, namely, 15th October.      The results of our examination are summarised in the two-Annexes to this memorandum.     Without necessarily accepting the more extensive line of policy which has been advocated by Sir&apos; Arthur Salter and others (vide paragraph 2 of this memorandum) we consider that there is a good case for obtaining the additional reserves set out in the two Annexes.    It is certain that the supplies mentioned would cost less now than during a period of war, and also that their arrival in this  country before hostilities begin would reduce the strain upon our merchant shipping and exchange under war conditions.8. We accordingly recommend that:-(i) Approval be given to the immediate purchase of the supplies shown in the Annexes to this memorandum (  or so much of them as the Departments concerned can, after further enquiries, arrange to be delivered to this country at a date not materially later than 15th October next),  the total cost not to exceed for raw materials  15 million and for food supplies   5 million, (ii) The Committee of Imperial Defence should arrange for a further review to be made of our long-term storage policy for both food supplies and raw materials in the early Autumn.(Initialled ) C.

FOOD SUPPLIES,List of commodities for which storage accommodation could be found in the United Kingdom and of which additional Government Reserves, ever and above those already authorised,  could be purchased without reduction of commercial stocks.V/heat and Cereals 0The total stocks in this country at any time between now and 15th October will be in excels of three months.      Storage accommodation is full, but if commercial stocks should fall at any time previous to 15th October, vacant stores could be filled by the Department-      The maximum quantity of wheat and cereals for which provision could be made under this arrangement is 100,^30 tons;  equivalent to one week&apos;s consumption of flour. The cost would be  5 a ton      500,000.Su^ar.The present  (spot; price of sugar is 1.6d. to 2s. per cwt. more than September/October sugar.      The result is that present commercial stocks are low.      Tate and Lyle have, however, recently agreed to prevent their stocks falling below 100,000 tons.      This will ensure that at no time between now and 15th October there will be less than three months&apos;&apos; requirements in the country-      In the Department&apos;s stores there is vacant space which would accommodate 20,000 tons.      It is recommended that this space should be filled by buying at once September sugar,.      The cost would be  220,000.Panned Meat and Fish-A further 10,000 tons Might be obtainable before   15th OcCdfcerat  70 per ton, costing  700,000.      This quantity would be equivalent to one week!s consumption of all imported meat.
Frozen Meat,There  are surplus stocks of frozen mutton loth in New Zealand and the Argentine and possibly in Australia. It would take two months to arrange for shipment and delivery from South America and three months from New Zealand or Australia.      If arrangements were made at once it is estimated that 30,000 tons of frozen meat,  some of which might he beef, could be delivered in this country by 15th October.      This would be the equivalent of three weeks&apos; consumption of all imported meat.      The cost at  30 a ton would amount to  900,000-      As compared with the cost of storing the existing reserves, the charge for- frozen meat would undoubted!;/ be high. Cold storage at  10 per ton would cost  300,000 per annum.Lard.25,000 tons could probably be obtained, practically wholly from the United States, at  35 per ton,  costing  875,000.      This is the equivalent of six weeks&apos; consumption of lard.      Storage charges would be at the rate of about 30/-per ton.      Prom the  food point of view the case for purchasing lard is not a strong one,  as the Department holds a large supply of whale oil,  from which synthetic  lard is made, the consumption of which is at the present time substantial.      The purchase of lard must, therefore, be considered from the point of view of saving shipping tonnage after the outbreak of hostilities.      Another factor is that the supply of butter which could be obtained now is small! .Butter.It is unlikely that more than 5,000 tons could be purchased for delivery hei&apos;e between now and loth October. The cost at  115 per ton would be  575,000.      This is the equivalent of one week&apos;s consumption.      Cold storage would be necessary at  10 per ton, amounting to  50,000 per annum.
4 A IfCheese.Not more than 100000 tons could, be purchased between now and 15th October.    The cost at  70 per ton would amount to  700,000.    Cold storage is not required for cheese.SUMMARY.The following table shows the total capital expenditure which would be involved in the purchase of all the supplies set out in the above paragraphs:-Tons., Capital Cost.
