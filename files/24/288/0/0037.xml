V 4ii jl 31THE COMMITTEE had. under consideration a Hote hy the Secretary covering a Schedule showing the present state of Defence Measures shown in Appendix &apos;-Gf to the Government War Book (Paper Ho. D.M.(39) 15). -1.    CALLING UP OP THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE AMD -COMPLETION QP MOBILISATION OF THE FLEET AND THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said that the Prime Minister had asked the Committee to consider the Reference:Schedules   completion of the Fleet mobilisation and the mobilisation of and SerialNos. the Regular Army Reserve.       Secrecy was not required as itII (6)III (5)     was hoped these measures when known abroad would have III (6)III (7) &apos;  beneficial political repercussions.      The Prime Minister of Apuendix&quot;G&quot;.J        did not wish to embody the Territorial Field Army at thisstage, but he thought that the Secretary of State for war might wish to call up certain Territorial- units connected withthe first Contingent of the Field Force.     Further questions whichthe Prime Minister thought might be left to the discretion of the meeting and in particular of the Secretary of Statefor War were (a) whether the whole of the Regular&apos;army reserve should be called up, or only the ll/0,000 menwhich the Secretary of State for War had originally askedfor, and (b) whether the procedure to be followed shouldbe that of individual summons under the 1939 Act, or that of Proclamation under the /Acts previously in force.THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR WAR said that as tothe first question, the calling up of additionalArmy Territorial units, he -would like authority to call up aMobilisation. /further 10,000 men. /&apos; As to the other points, he wouldlike to call up the- whole of the Regular Army Reserve.The question of whether procedure by individual summons orby Proclamation should be followed was more complicated andinvolved points Which would be of interest to the other Service!
9 *-ii &apos;  &apos;:)Departmentsu     The advantages of procedure by-Proclamation were that it was (a) more expeditious and (b) gave the Army authorities certain ancillary powers e.g* to impress vehicles which they would ultimately require,      On the other hand men called up &quot;by proclamation would not receive the treatment in respect of allowances for dependents and the protection of civil rights which would he conferred, on them by the 1939 Act, if they were called up &quot;by individual summons:    that is to say that   they would be in a worse position than the men already called up. He had come to the conclusion that the right course would be to follow the procedure of the 1939 Act, even though it would involve seme delay, and would mean that he would have  to hire the vehicles he required      This would give Departments time to consider the question of allowances to dependents and protection of civil rights for men called up by-Proclamation0       When this question was settled he would suggest that the Proclamation should he issued and all men however called up given the protection and allowances then decided upon.SIR EDWARD BRIDGES said that he understood that it was intended that press notices should he issued that afternoon announcing the steps now decided on,  so that adequate publicity would be achieved even though a Proclamation was not issued.If it was doalvod to &amp;&amp;&amp;(xLovcfrd &quot;She.-&quot;procedure by individual summons-an announcement could bx&amp; made by the B^BcC,  asking all the men who would receive individual summons to report at once to the appropriate place.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR agreed that this would meet his point,,
NavalMohilisation.SIR JAMES GRIGG said that the scale of allowances to dependents had &quot;been agreed between the Service Departments and the Treasury;    the question of the protection of civil rights was still under discussion.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that the Admiralty were anxious to complete naval mohilisation. They would prefer however to proceed by individual summons, as they would not be ready for all the reservists unti3....th.o wo.r3.c_on..armed, morchftnt vessels was eonpletoRoyal Air ForceMobilization.Position of Militia.PressAnnouncements.THE SECRETARY OF STATE 1&apos;0R AIR, raising the question of completing the mobilis.ati.on ofthe Royal Air Force ^dltsatMSOff Reserve--said ho would like to have the authority of tho OoBEiiittoe id flail lip iUs roraaining members of this reserve at his discretion^-&apos;THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said that the Prime Minister had mentioned this point to him and was prepared to agree to it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he would like to mention the position of the members of the militia now embodied.     He would prefer that these should not receive the same treatment as regular personnel (ices a daily rate of pay of 2/- in the place of l/6) until after the outbreak of war, as otherwise if war did not break out it would be very difficult to secure that they should revert to their previous rate of pay.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT said that he thought that it was desirable that any communication to the press should receive the approval of the-Prime Minister^
THE COMMITTEE agreed that:-(l)    The Secretary of State for war should call up forthwith under the   -Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Act, 1939 by individual summons,(i) 10,000 additional members&apos; . of the Territorial Army,(ii) the&apos;&apos;, whole, of the Regular Lossy Reserve,(2)    The Admiralty should complete the mobilisation of the Fleet by individual summons as required.(3)    The Secretary of State for air should have discretion to complete the mobilisation of the Royal Air   -Force Volunteer Reserve by&apos;individual summons under the 1939 Act.(4)    The Departments concerned in consultation with the Treasury should approve as soon as possible the scale of allowances of dependents and the degree of protection of civil rights of men called up by Proclamation.(5)    As soon as agreement had been obtained under (4) above, a mobilisation Proclamation should be issued which should apply these terms of service to all men called up,  except only the Militia.(6)    The terms of service of the Militia should remain as now until the outbreak of war, when they should be assimilated to those in force in other branches of the Services.(7)   The terms of the press announcement regarding naval and army mobilisation should be submitted to the Prime Minister.
2 .      evi-iCUATIGH OF CIVIL POP ULATi ON akd CIVIL HOSPITAL SCHEME.(Reference THIS LORD PRIVY SEAL informed the Committee that schedule IIISerial NQs. orders had been issued to start the evacuation of3 and 4).the civil population to-morrow.    It was hoped that evacuation would he complete by Monday in London and Liverpool,  and by Sunday in other areas.    The clearing of civil hospitals had also been begun. Stretcher cases (i*-e^-aer-lous--cases) were being evacuated, but &quot;walking&quot; cases which wo uld eventually -merely be sent home and not be evacuated had not been moved.    The Minister of Transport was anxious that in these circumstances the Railways should be ta&amp;en..over.    The Treasury had agreed this step, subject to reference to the Prine Ilinxster,,.(Reference THE MINISTER PGR SUPPLY reminded the CommitteeSchedule IIISerial No. 15). that an order to ta&amp;e over the Railways was signed in September last year, but had not been communicated to the Railways.THE COMMITTED took note of the statement of the Lord Privy Seal.3 .

MORRISON raised the question of the dispersal(Reference ScheduleIII Serial    Qf food stocks from vulnerable areas, such as the Port of No, 2 oft.$PPcnffx       London.      It was a big dob involving heavy expenditure and &quot;G&quot; &apos;oo theGovernment    on this account it had been delayed with the idea that it War Book)should be ordered at the same time as evacuation.      Since the latter had now been ordered., he pressed, that authority should be given to disperse food stocks.SIR HENRY FRENCH explained that the principal items involved were-(i)TeaThis was the most important item.      The equivalent of eight months supply for the whole country was at present concentrated in the London area, and if lost through enemy action could not be replaced.      He proposed that 20,000 tons should be moved out of London at once and the remaining 40,000 dispersed along the Thames riverside.in wharfs as far as Brentford.      This wauid involve no road or rail reouirements.(ii)   Frogen Meat35,000 tons were at present concentrated in London and of this he proposed to move out 10,000 tons.

This would, take 48 hours.MR.
