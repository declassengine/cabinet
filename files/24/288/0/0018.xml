A.C.  440,BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY OOUKCIL. STATE OF TRADE,&apos; JUKE,  1939.Summary of Reports submitted &quot;by Members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other    sources).OVERSEA? TRADE.    Imports in June ( 82.2 million)  showed an increase of  5.6 million as compared with June, 1938. Imports of raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were  2.7 million more and imports of food, drink and tobacco  2.4 million less.    Exports of United Kingdom products ( 39.9 million) were  3 million more than in June,  1938.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  In the four weeks ended 25th June 1939 railway traffic receipts increased by  457;COO or 3.8$, as compared with the corresponding period of 1938.The total receipts for the twenty-five weeks ended 25th June showed an increase of  235.COO or .3% as compared w the corresponding period of 1938.EMPLOYMENT. Employment in June showed a further marked improvement.It is provisionally estimated that at the 12th June the number of insured persons,  aged 16/64,  (including those insured under the agricultural scheme and in the classes of domestic employment which became insurable at the 4th April, 1938) in employment was approximately 12,810,000.    This was 143,000 more than   at the 15th May,  1939, and on a comparable basis approximately 600,000 more than at the 13th June,  1938.BANKING. Provincial Clearings increased in June as compared with June,  1938, &quot;by about 6.1$.    This strengthens previous indications of increased spending power in the Pro vine es.Bill rates remained steady during the early part of June at about 9/16$, but rose in the latter half of the month.
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD. &quot;&apos;Belgium,    The belga has been firmer during the month and the rate of discount at the Belgian National Bank was reduced on the 6th July from 3$, at which figure it had stood since the 10th May, to 2^%.China.    New measures to maintain the Chinese dollar have been announced, including a &quot;ban on imports of luxuries. It is hoped to reduce the adverse trade balance by 230 million Chinese   dollars a year as a result of the new restrictions.France.. The adverse balance of trade in the first half of 1939 was only 69725 million francs as compared with 9,300 million francs in the first half of 1938;    the improvement was due to the increase in the value of exports, the value of imports having been maintained.The inflow of gold into the Stabilisation Fund continues.Holland.    The guilder weakened at the beginning of June, but support from the Netherlands Bank caused a recovery. The resignation of the Cabinet at the end of June made Holland&apos;s future financial policy uncertain.Japan.    The excess of exports over imports in the first half of 1939 was 25 million yen, a larger sum than in any corresponding period since the Great Y,rar.     This was the result of strict control of imports.Sweden.    There was a deficit of 53 million kroner in the ordinary Budget for the nine months ending the 31st March 1939 as compared with a surplus of 33 million kroner in the nine months from July 1937 to March 1938.      The Budget for 1939-40 shows a further rise in expenditure, but taxation is to be reduced.United States of America. The improvement in &quot;businessconditions which &quot;began in May, was maintained in June.    Theposition in the consumer goods industries, except the textile industry, appears satisfactory.    The improvement was not dueto any increased demand for goods from the heavy industries for privately-sponsored capital construction.-2-
SHIPPING.    The Chamber of Shipping index number of shippingfreights (1935 ---- 100) fell from 129.6 in May to 121.5 in June.There has beer; little change in most trades except for a 1 91 (j j)shrinkage in shipments of grain end a deterioration in the outward trade to East African ports.    June, July and to s certain extent August are the dull months for cereal shipping, but the shrinkage in June this year was unusually marked.SHIPBUILDINGr   The increase in activity which has occurred in recent months has been maintained.    Tonnage commenced in shipyards in Great Britain and Ireland in the quarter ended 30th June was 403,000 gross tons,  compared with 71,000 tons in the March quarter and 157,000 tons a year ago.ENGINEERING. The percentage of unemployment in the engineering industry in June was 5.4 aa compared with 6.0 in May,  1939,and 7.8 in June,  .1933.    The steady expansion in activity, as the result of Government orders continued and civil work, both for home and export markets,  appeared to be well maintained.The preliminary estimate of the financial results of the engineering and allied industries for the financial year 1938 indicates that the aggregate of net earned profits declined by about 4 per cent,  as compared with 1937.NON-FERROUS METALS. Metal market8 remained steady in June, and trade was active. World stocks of copper fell, although there was little change in the price of the metal in the course of June. The cash price of tin was in the neighbourhood of the upper limit sought &quot;by the controllers of the Buffer Stock. The output quota v/as increased as from July 1st, but production is unlikely to increase sufficiently to bring down the price.MOTORi Ij.Tr;rjSTRY. New registrations of mechanically propelled vehicles in May were 4-5,500,  an increase of 8,017 or 21.5^ as compared with May,  1938.United Kingdom exports of new private cars,  commercial vehicles and chassis increased in June as compared with June 1938 but in the nine months October 193C - June 1959 were valued at only  8.5 million as compared with 39.5 million in the period October, 1937 - June, 1958.7 7 rr
GOAL.    There was little change in the coal trade in June.      Enquiries for emergency supplies were, however, fewer than in May,, although the upward trend in the volume of the export trade was not affected-In the inland market deliveries to the iron and steel industry and to the railways remained at a high level.CHEMICALS.      The demand for heavy chemicals remained satisfactory but deliveries of alkali, both in the home and export trade, showed a decrease in June as compared with May.      The demand for chemicals for the rayon industry showed a further improvement and there were signs of a better demand from the rubber industry.The improvement in the demand for dyestuffs continued and there was an improvement in the outlook for coal tar products;    sales of fertilisers, both in the home and foreign markets, continued, however,  tc show a decrease as compared with 1938.COTTON.      At the beginning of June, activity in the cotton industry declined slightly from the level reached in May, but production and employment increased appreciably later in the month.     The index of yarn output per working day was lower at 103 as compared with 106 in May.      Government purchases of military equipment accounted for much of the increased demand but affected only certain sections of the industry.Prices of raw cotton rose in the course of June.BUILDING.    The decline in house-building was continued, but has been largely offset by the increasedamount of Government work.     There has been a shortageof labour of certain types in areas particularly affectedby Government work e.g., carpenters in the Salisbury Plainarea, but unemployment in other trades less affected by Government orders,  e.g., plastering,  is greater than twelve-months ago.    Non-residential building work for civil requirements has remained steady, except in a few districts where fear of damage by war is particularly acute.-4-
The price of cement was reduced by l/- per ton as -from the 19th June.      The price of steel has not changed, but 1 ^J prices of timber, especially of the lighter kinds have risen.RETAIL TRAPS.    The money value of average daily sales was 9.1^S higher in May than in May, 1938;    the increase was partly attributable to the change in the date of Whitsun.Average daily sales of food and perishables increased in value by 8*9% in May compared, with May, 1938, although food prices fell by 3% in the course of the year;    the only area in which sales did not increase was Central London where there was a decline of 4.5%.Average daily sales of non-food merchandise were 9.4$ higher in May than in May, 1938, in spite of a fractional decline in prices;    Central London was again the only area in which a decline occurred.The cost value of retail stocks at the end of May was 2,8$ lower than a year earlier.Pull statistics for June are not yet available but preliminary indlications are that the anticipated decline in sales as compared with June, 1938, has taken place.       (The decline was expected because of the change in the date of Whitsun).CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTTISH).    Sales of drapery and of most types of furniture have improved recently and prospects for the future are satisfactory.      Trade in linoleum and jute bags has been well maintained, the latter largely on account of Government orders.CANADI AIM T RAPE.    Economic conditions improved slightly inCanada in May;    the index of the physical volume of business was 121.4 as compared with 116.7 in April.Exports of Canadian produce were valued, at $94 million in May as compared with $57.8 million in May, 1938;    about one half of this increase is attributable to exports of non-monetary gold which were valued at $13.3 million in May, 1939, whereas none was snipped in May, 1938.-5-
1 *Y, nCOLONIAL TRADE. Prices of cocoa, oil seeds and nuts, vegetable oils, sisal and cotton have been unsatisfactory in the second quarter of 1939. Prospects for the rubber and tin industries have improved.The decision of the International Sugar   Council to grant a considerable increase in the quota for the year,- - - -1st September 1938 - 31st August 1939, involves an increase of about 100,000 metric tons in the quota allotted to the Colonial Empire;    this is expected to benefit Mauritius, Fiji and the West Indies.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.      South African exports other!&quot;*&quot;&quot;-----------than gold increased hy 10.4% in May as compared with May, 1938.      There was a large expansion in exports of general merchandise and increases in exports of diamonds, maize, hides and shins, fruit, copper and coal.      Imports into the Union of South Africa increased in May by 7*9% as compared with May, 1938.
