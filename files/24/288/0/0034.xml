(THIS DOGUlviHRT IS THE PHOPEriTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY TS GOVERNMENT).COPY No.      k-(f-SECRET.CP. No. 185/39.CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated August 16th, 1939.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State lor India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situation in India,  dated the 16th August,  1939,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1..     Indian States. The agitation against Hyderabad State is over.    On July 1.9th the Darbar published its long awaited scheme for internal reforms,  and on the 21st-the despatch of volunteers to the State was suspended for a week as a conciliatory gesture until the organisers of the agitation decided their attitude to the reforms.    On the 25th they decided to get certain doubtful points in the scheme further clarified before coming to a final decision;   in the meantime parties of volunteers were instructed to stay where they were.    It appeared at first that the reforms were considered unsatisfactory by nearly all interested parties.    However, on July 30th the Hindu Manasabha resolved to suspend the civil disobedience campaign in order to put the operation of the reforms to the test;  and after the Nizam&apos;s Government had issued a communique clarifying the doubtful points, the Arya Samajist organisers,  appreciating the conciliatory spirit shown by the Darbar,  called off the movement and directed all volunteers to disband.    So ends an agitation which for many months has not only been a source of anxiety to the State but has severely embittered communal feeling in many Provinces of British India.It was suggested in the last Appreciation that Gandhi might find a useful instrument in the All-India State People&apos;s Conference.    Writing on August 5th he returned to the question of the responsibility of Congress in the States and declared that in future he would give no direct advice snd that workers in the States should refer their problems to the standing committee of the Conference,  &quot;the only body designed for guiding the States&apos;  peoples&quot;.
,&apos;-&apos;:l-. 2.2-      The Congress Party.    The last Appreciation described Subhas Bose&apos;s &quot;protest&quot; against the All-India Congress Committee&apos;s resolutions.    The wrath of-She right, wing has now descended on his head;  by a resolution of the Working Committee passed on August 11th Bose,  &quot;for his grave act of indiscipline&quot;3 has been disqualified as president of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee as well as debarred from being a member of any elective Congress Committee for a period of three years.    As regards other offenders, provincial Congress organisations have been given a free hand to take such disciplinary action as they consider, necessary.    Bose has with a brave show announced his pleasure at this decision which,  he says, virtually expels him from the Congress,  and Which he characterises as the &quot;logical consequence of the process of right consolidation&quot;.    He has warned the Working Committee that their action will hurt them more than himself,  and announced his&apos; intention of clinging to the Congress with even greater devotion and continuing the work of the Forward Bloc.    Bose had previously conducted long and not unsuccessful tours in various parts of India, but - it still seems difficult to accept his estimate of the &quot;wonderful response that the Forward Bloc has received&quot;.The Working Committee&apos;s session at Wardha lasted from August 9th to the 12th.    The despatch of Indian troops to Egypt and Singapore was regarded as a step&quot;which might lead to India&apos;s entanglement in a war&quot;,  and the&quot;Committee therefore passed a-long resolution on the international situation.    This resolution expressed the sympathy of Congress with the peoples who stand for democracy and freedom,  and condemned Fascist aggression with which was coupled the betrayal of democracy by British Imperialism in Czecho-Slovakia and. Spain.    It repeated the determination
of Congress to oppose attempts to &quot;impose&quot; a war on India and drew attention to the &quot;war resolution&quot; passed at Calcutta in May (see &quot;Appreciation No.5),  in which the Congress expressed its disapproval of the despatch of Indian troops overseas.    Therefore, as a first step to give effect to the Congress policy, the Working Committee called upon all Congress members of the Central Assembly to refrain from attending the next session, which is due to begin this month. The Committee also reminded Provincial Governments to assist in no way the war preparations of the British Government,  and to be prepared for resignation on this issue if necessary.    All that the&apos; Commitxee is prepared to encourage is protective war measures within the control of Provincial Governments;  this apparently covers Air Raid Precautions..   Although this resolution sounds ominous,  such little as is known of the views of Gandhi and others strengthens the belief that there will at any rate be no active obstruction from Congress in the event of a war;. The resolution may perhaps be read partly as an attempt to steal the left-wing&apos;s thunder and partly as a warning to Government that,  if they want Congress help, they must make it possible for Congress to say that such help has been given voluntarily.During July Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Ceylon in order to effect a settlement of questions relating to Indian employees of the Ceylon Government.    The Working Committee considered his report at &quot;Waraha and passed a lengthy resolution criticising the attitude of the Ceylon Government and expressing the opinion that all emigration of labour from India to Ceylon should be stopped.    Before this resolution was passed the Central Government had already prohibited emigration of persons to Ceylon for the purposes of unskilled work,  in view of the fact that the Ceylon Government had decided, to terminate the employment of
numerous unskilled Indian workers.    Other resolutions passed by the Working Committee at Waraha are mentioned elsewhere.Gandhi has again given voice to his forebodings about the tendency to violence in the Congress,  and has suggested that if Congressmen have come to the conclusion that non-violence is played nut or impossible of attainment there should be a conference to consider whether this policy should be revised and to frame a programme in consonance with the present temper of Congressmen.3.        The Muslim League.    Sir Sikandar Hyat has published the full details of his alternative federal scheme (see Appreciation No.5).    Its    reception has been unenthusiastic to say the least of it.    Jinnah has now &quot;reluctantly come to the conclusion&quot; that a democratic system of parliamentary government is unsuited to a country like India, where the cultures of the two major communities are so different    that one will always try to suppress the other.    Subhas Bose made overtures to Jinnah with a view to exploring the possibility of united action directed to weakening the power of the Congress right wing, but Jinnah refused to negotiate so long as Gandhi retains his domination and repeated his insistence on the League being recognised as the sole representative Muslim organisation in India.Provincial Affairs.4.      Assam.    The Digboi strike continues.    In July a judicial officer was appointed as a conciliation board, but it is understood that the proceedings have fallen through.    The Oil Company made an offer to the strikers,  conditional on the strike being called off at once, promising them an ex-gratia    payment and preference in filling vacancies during the&quot;next year; the offer was refused.
Bengal. The terrorist prisoners&apos; hunger-strike began to assume a dangerous colour at the end of July.    The Congress President and Gandhi&apos;s secretary interviewed the Home Minister of Bengal and the prisoners, but failed to get the strike called off.    The whole weight of the right wing of Congress was thrown into attempts to effect a settlement and they obviously feared the political effect of possible developments.    At this stage Subhas Bose intervened,  offering the Bengal Ministry the support of the local Congress if they would release the prisoners, and threatening &quot;direct action&quot; if they refused.    This offer and threat was later endorsed by the Provincial Congress Committee.    The offer was based on the assumption (for which there are no grounds) that the attitude of the Bengal Government had been dictated by the Governor and the European Group in the Assembly.    The Bengal Government stood firm.    At the beginning of August Gandhi again appealed to the prisoners to give up their fast, characterising it as unjustifiable and a bad example which, if copied, would &quot;make orderly government impossible&quot;.It was Subhas Bose who accomplished what the right wing leaders had failed to do;   after interviews with the Home Minister and the prisoners, on August 3rd he persuaded the latter to suspend their fast for two months, the Provincial Congress Committee.having undertaken full responsibility for conducting a campaign for their release. There has been no change in the Government&apos;s policy, but theydo hope to be able to finish the task of examining the cases of the remaining prisoners and to pass orders within two months.    A statement issued on August 4th made it clear that Government had accepted no time-limit for release and come to no understanding with any party,  and that although orders will probably be passed in two months that does not
2n6.necessarily mean that all the prisoners will be released. So it is from Bose&apos;s hands that the Congress right wing have had to accept what, they could not accomplish;  the suspension of the strike has given them an opportunity, but they have the uneasy knowledge that any failure to make use of it will be fully exploited by the left.    On August 12th the Working Committee passed a resolution appealing to  ; the Bengal and Punjab Governments to release all their &quot;political prisoners&quot; and expressing severe condemnation of hunger-strikes in words similar to those used &quot;by Gandhi.Bombay.    &quot;Prohibition&quot; was inaugurated in Bombay city and suburbs, with suitable celebrations, on August 1st. The day was marred by a disturbance;  a huge procession of Muslims, taken out to protest against the imposition of the property tax, became so disorderly that the police had to open fire.    Nine persons were injured in the firing and about 30 more in the disturbances-    Among the Government1s measures to restore peace was an order prohibiting five newspapers - three Muslim and two Parsi - from publishing unapproved news or coininents about the riot or about agitation against the tax;  this order was rescinded on August 9th, not before&apos; it had come in for much criticism as an unwarrantable restriction upon the liberty of the Press. A High Court Wudge has been appointed to enquire into the disturbances.    The Governor has decided that all entertainment of an official nature at Government House will be &quot;dry&quot;,  in order to fall into line with the Government&apos;s policy.    Vallabhai Patel has threatened that next year Congress Governments will fight the Central Government for the necessary finance to implement their schemes of &quot;prohibition&quot;,  and that they will resign in case the Centre refuses such assistance.    The Congress Working Committee has since passed a resolution calling upon
Congress Ministries to speed up their &quot;prohibition&quot;    policies and &quot;where they have demonstrable financial difficulty to call upon the Central Government to make up the deficit&quot;.The economic situation in parts&apos;of the Province is serious.    Thousands of cattle are reported to have died owing to shortage of water and fodder.    The price of fodder rocketed, and on August 12th&apos;an ordinance was issued to provide for the control of the distribution and prices of fodder and grain in the Province.Madras.    On July 17th the Madras Government promulgated an ordinance to indemnify all officers, trustees and others, from all liability in respect of acts done in connection with temple entry by untouchables.    The ordinance was necessary because the Legislature was not in session. The Legislature met early in August and the Temple Entry Indemnity Bill was passed without difficulty.Pun,j ab.    The sweepers&apos;   strike habit spread to another large town, Multan, at the end of July, where the municipal sweepers went on strike on July 23rd.    The strike fizzled out after three days.United Provinces.     There is much labour unrest in Cawnpore.    One strike in a jute mill towards the end of July was quickly terminated, but on July 27th the workers of the New Victoria &quot;Mills,  Cawnpore,  struck work and the management declared a lock-out, and ultimately notified all employees th.at their services were terminated.    The local Labour.Union, which has recently been reprimanded by the Government, has replied aggressively and demanded Government&apos;s intervention and assistance.The report of the Select Committee on the Tenancy Bill was presented to the Legislative Council on August 10th.    The Employment Tax Bill has been passed
9 ft. * ft 1/ &apos;18.by the Legislature and has been reserved by the Governor for the orders of the Governor-General.5-        Economic.    Shortage of rain is causing distress in parts of Bombay, the Central Provinces, the Punjab,  Delhi and Ajmer-Merwara.6.        Waziristan.    During the month the faqir of Ipi has moved his headquarters to kharre re on the northern border of the North Waziristan Agency.    He has there been interviewed by the leaders of hostile gangs and probably as a result the activates of such gangs have considerably increased.    The sniping of camps, posts and road protection troops has been intensified.    Bombs have been laid an -.paths used by the troops and considerable damage has been done to telegraph lines.    Hostile gangs remain active on the borders of the northern part of the Bannu district and the southern part of the Kohat district,  and it has been found necessary to place a further portion of tribal territory in this vicinity under air proscription., Opposition to these gangs has been more effective than previously and in a raid on a village near Bannu one of the principal hostile leaders was killed with one companion, and in a raid on a village in the Kohat district three hostiles were killed,  five wounded and three captured.
