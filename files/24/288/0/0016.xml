1 1 &apos;J(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE-PROPERTY OP&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S - G-0VSR1MENT) 0 SECRET.CP.  166  (39). . COPY NO., ?V 7 C. A B I N E To C O-0P.BINATI ON OP DEFENCE PROGRAMMES,.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.lo Events  inuring the last few months have resultedin frequent submissions being made by the Defence Departments to the Treasury and the Cabinet for large and costly additions to the programmes previously authorised.      The conditions under which we have been working, which have necessitated very rapid decisions being reached in the light of the ever-changing -  international situation, have made it inevitable that decisions on these submissions should sometimes have been reached without adequate time for consideration of their effect upon,  and place in, a balanced scheme of defence.2. Looking at the matter first from the financialpoint of view, it&apos;is clearly undesirable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be called upon to consider large demands from one Service without knowledge that other large demands may before long be submitted to him by other Services.      There is always the risk,  so long as such a procedure prevails, that proposals for expenditure will be considered in isolation, without regard to priorities, and perhaps without relating them to our defence needs as a whole.3. The need for considering the Defence programmes as a whole is reinforced if the matter is considered^ &apos;&quot;-   from the point of view of availability of labour supply and of industrial resources.     A recent instance of this is the effect on the building programmes of the Services as a whole, of the demands for hutted accommodation
resulting ftrcm the Compulsory Military Training Act.      With the recent increases in the scope of the Defence Programmes it seems likely that shortages of labour and of productive capacity are likely to develop in other spheres.      Unless the Government are in a position to envisage the situation as a, whole from the point of view of demands on labour and manufacturing resources, there is grave risk that any increases or extensions of the existing programmes which may hereafter be sanctioned would only result in delaying progress on projects previously authorised.4. I understand that proposals will shortly be submittedto the Gommittee of Imperial Defence for setting up priority machinery forthwith in the Service Departments, with a Central Priority Department in the Ministry of Supply, .reporting to a Ministerial Priority Committee.      Priority machinery, however, only operates in regard to approved policy,  and it is for the settlement of policy itself that something further is needed. The immediate proposal which I make is that, if any of the Defence Departments, or the Lord. Privy Sealrs Office, make new proposals which involve heavy demands on labour, manufacturing capacity or finance, over and above the demands involved by the programmes already authorised, those proposals should be considered by a Ministerial Committee, the composition of which is dealt with in paragraph 6 below.      This Ministerial Committee would also require information as to any substantial demands, likely to be submitted in the near future by any other of the Service Departments or for Civil Defence.      The first task of this Ministerial Committee would thus be to satisfy themselves whether these additions or extensions to the programmes involve calls on labour and manufacturing capacity beyond the resources which can be made available for the Defence Services or for Civil Defence.      In order to enable the Ministerial Committee to obtain the necessary information for this purpose, there shouldlbe an Inter-Departmental Committee under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster comprising official representatives of
1*7The^Adrniralty, ^The&quot;Air Ministry, The War Office, The Ministry of Supply, The Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Office, The Board of Trade, The Ministry of Labour, The Treasury.5. When the Ministerial Committee have received thereport of the Interdepartmental Committee and have ascertained whether the programmes proposed are within the available production and labour resources, it will be necessary to decide how the programmes which come before them should be fitted into the balanced scheme of Defence, covering the whole range of our defence prepara-tions, taking into account our strategical needs and our financial strength.      The carrying out of this function clearly involves issues of the highest importance, analogous to those dealt with by the Ministerial Committees which considered the Defence Programmes laid down at the commencement of re-armament.6. I have reached the conclusion that the best andmost expeditious method of dealing with the two types ofissues referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 is to set up asingle Ministerial Committee, composed as follows:-Prime Minister (Chairman),Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(Deputy Chairman), Chancellor of the Exchequer, The three Service Ministers, Minister of Supply, Lord Privy Seal, and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (other Ministers being co-opted as necessary).
Following the precedent of ordinary Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should preside at Meetings of the Committee   when questions affecting labour supply and industrial capacity (referred to in paragraph 4) are under investigation, while the Prime Minister would preside when the issues referred to in paragraph 5 are discussed.7. The proposal made in this Memorandum is limited in the first instance to the needs of the immediate situation, namely, proposals for new projects or additional acceleration made between now and next March.      I leave over for later consideration the question whether the procedure outlined above should be used to determine our policy in regard to further proposals arising after that date.(Intel.)    N,C,21st July. 1959.
