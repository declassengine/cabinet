./liaw/02o. jDEPARTMENT OP ^FORMATIONintelligence bureau.WEEKLYREPORTGERMANY19 September, 1917.1.     The new &quot;Free Commit tee&quot;, consisting of seven members of the Reichstag and seven of the Federal Council - the latter being the body which represents the different German Sovereigns and State Governments, and which is, therefore, constitutionally-speaking, the German Imperial Government - met last Monday, September 10, under the Presidency of the Imperial Chancellor, Dr. Michaelis, and discussed the German reply to the Pope&apos;s Peace Note. The Committee, which is merely consultative and does not vote, is reported to have disposed of the subject which was submitted to its consideration, so that another meeting about the reply to the Pope will not be necessary.     It is- stated that indications of the nature of the German reply may be given to the press in the course of the current week (September 16-23), and that the text of the reply may be published in the following week (September 23-30). It is unlikely that any of the stories of what took place in the Committee are trustworthy.     A Berlin Radical paper reported that the disoussions had been &quot;lively&quot; and that one thing which the reply to the Pope will make clear is that &quot;Belgium must not in anv circumstances become a bulwark of Great Britain on the Continent&quot;.      it is worth noting that although what takes place in the &quot;Free Committee&quot; does not bind the Imperial Government or the Reichstag parties, a record (protocol) of its proceedings is kept.     If any attempt is made to use this reoord in order to oommit the Majority Parties to approval of the Government&apos;s action, there is sure to be a revolt.    Indeed the leading newspaper organ of the governmental Socialists already wishes the Free Committee a &quot;speedy end&quot;.
It remains to be seen whether the reply to the Pope&apos;s note will go beyond generalities and give definite indications of the terms of peace which Germany would offer or accept.     Inferences that the reply will go into details have been drawn from various official and semi-official utterances, including statements made by Dr. Miohaelis himself at Stuttgart in the course of several interviews which he granted to Bditors of Wurttemberg newspapers on Friday, September 7.     In one of these interviews he declined to say anything about the future of Belgium or Courland and Lithuania. But he assured his interviewer that things were taking shape and that &quot;at no distant date Germany would be able to formulate her peace conditions&quot;.     As for Alsace-Lorraine, it had not yet been decided whether it was to be divided or formed into an autonomous Federal State of the Empire.2. When the institution of the &quot;Free Committee&apos;1 wasannounced about three weeks ago, it was stated that it would first discuss the answer to the Pope&apos;s Uote and then, if the experiment proved a success, it might be turned on to other important subjects.    There are now hints in the inspired press that the first of these other subjects will be the Polish question, i.e. Russian Poland.     Indeed, the future of all the enemy territories which Germany now occupies is a question which excites the anxious interest of the Reichstag, and it is desired and expected that a clearer programme with regard to them should be enunciated*. The Chancellor&apos;s recent visit to Brussels is regarded as having been intended to give him the data for a franker enunciation of policy with regard to the future of Belgium.     And as regards Poland, a declaration has just been issued by the Austrian Emperor to the Governor of the Austrian sphere of occupation, Count Szeptyoki, and in similar terms by the German Emperor to the Governor General of Warsa?/.     Peiding the installation of a Polish King and the election of a popular assembly, measures which cannot he carried out in time of war, the supreme State
authority is to be vested in a Council of Regency of three members whose aotions will be subjeot to the confirmation of the Governors-General, and who are to be appointed by the Sovereigns of the occupying Powers.     This measure is described as &quot;continuing the consolidation of Poland&quot;.    The Regency Council will have legislative Powers subject to the veto of the Governors-General. Aooording to a proolamation issued by the German and&apos; Austrian Governors at Warsaw and Lublin, the Council of Regency will appoint a Premier who will carry out-the appointment of Polish national ministers.     This is merely a new variety of the kind of government whioh Bismarck gave Alsace-Lorraine immediately after the annexation.3, Altogether, anxiety regarding the issue of the warand regarding Germany&apos;s political and commercial position after the war, is becoming constantly more intense.     It is not the military situation that weighs most heavily upon men&apos;s minds, since the majority, at any rate, are kept in good heart by the more or less mendaoious reports of successful defence and successful counter-strokes on the West front and by actual achievements, like the occupation of Riga, on the East.    But no one in Germany seems to be able to guess how long the Allies&apos; &quot;will-to-war&quot;, as the Kaiser oalls it, will continue, and what further sacrifices it will entail for Germany.    There exists a manifest fear of the effects of further warfare with Russia as being likely to weld the revolutionary masses in that country into a force with which Germany might have to reckon for a century, just as she has constantly had to reckon with France since the French Revolution. 5!he newspapers are beginning to abandon their efforts to oast ridioule upon Amerioa&apos;s preparations, as the prospect of having to encounter the additional impact of a strong American contingent next spring looms nearer.    Attacks upon President Wilson, no
doubt, continue;   the Conservatives and Pan-Germans indulge in them because they are infuriated by his exposure of Ger.un autocracy and of German methods of policy and warfare, the Radicals and some of the Governmental Socialists because they fear -or say they fear - that his demand for democratic reform in Germany as a condition of peaoe negotiations will make reformers seem to be bowing to foreign dictation.       The Kaiser, feeling himself to be directly attacked by the President&apos;s Jfote, has joined in the clamour and is sending out telegrams in reply to addressed from military veterans and other associations, in one of which he describes &quot;Kaiser and Empire&quot; as the watchword which has inspired Germany in this great struggle.    Hindenburg, too, has telegraphed to the Cologne Chamber of Commerce expressing his confidence that the result of the seventh German war loan will give Mr, Wilson a clear answer to his &quot;attempt to sow dissension among us&quot;.     But Mr. Wilson&apos;s note is not going to kill reform in Germany, as the reactionaries hope and some of the reform majority profess to fear.     The leading newspaper organs of the Catholic Centre, the Radical left and the Social Democrats, unite in maintaining that Mr. Wilson&apos;s advocacy of democratisation must not prevent the German people from democratising their institutions.4. $Tor has the American reply to the Pope stemmed therising tide of the peace movement in Germany.     It has only altered to Borne extent the methods by which peace talk is being propagated. German propaganda is now at work upon the origin of the war and is endeavouring to make the most of the &quot;revelations&quot; at the Sukbom-linoff trial.    The organ of the Government, the &quot;North German Gazette&quot;, goes back to the beginning of the phase of the European crisis which led up to the situation that caused the war - the lawless annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Kungery in 1908.     The Kaiser&apos;s intervention at Petrograd in 1909 in order to make Russia dissociate herself publicly from Serbia was not,
according to this aocount, a humiliating coercion of Russia, hut was a case of &quot;friendly mediation&quot;, a &quot;friendly step&apos;, undertaken at the instance of Russia herself.    k. Isvolsky, then Russian kinistei for Foreign Affairs, had to invoke the help of the German Chancellor, Prince Btilow, to &quot;get his car out of the mud;&apos;.     This was evidently not the Kaiser&apos;s own view when he went to Vienna in 1910 and spoke at the Rsthaus of his having appeared at the side of the Emperor Irancis Joseph at a grave moment &quot;in shining armour&quot;. Anyone who followed events during the crisis of 1908-9 will remember that the German intervention was &amp;t the time regarded everywhere as a trial of strength and a challenge to the Triple Entente. Prince Billow himself, in his book on Deutsche Po.litik, interpreted the issue oi the 1908-9 crisis in the sense of a German triumph, The fatal crisis at the end of Julj 1914 was an attempt to renew that triumph or as an alternative to bring about a war in which Germany would establish her unchallenged supremacy in Bui ope. The pretext of Russian mobilisation against Germany will not hold water, since the telegrams addressed by the Emperor to the Tsar in those fateful days all refer to the mobilisation against Austria-Hungary as the cause of the acute crisis.The attempt to rehabilitate the Kaiser and to represent him as the guardian of European peace throughout his reign -a conception to which some Englishmen still miraculously cling -has been frustrated by one disclosure alter another.    Kr. Gerard&apos;s reminiscences have been followed by the &quot;Willy-Nicky&quot; correspondence, while the German defence of the Treaty palmed off upon the Tsar at BjBrkb&quot; in 1904, has elicited the full story of the origin of that treaty and the end of it as narrated in an interview with h. Isvolsky, published simultaneously bv the Paris Temps and the Copenhagen Berlingske Tidende, last Saturday,     The clumsy duplicity of the Kaiser in his dealings with the Tsar on that occasion is paralleled by several previous instances of the same thing.
ln 1897 the Kaiser waylaid the Tsar at Homburg on his way home from a visit to Darmstadt, and extracted his consent to the German occupation of Kiao Chau.     This arrangement was not known at the time to either the Russian or the German Foreign Office, and, when an animated exchange of views broke out between them after the Gernan landing, the Kaiser laughed heartily and expressed himself in very broad language as he told the British Ambassador, Sir Prank L&amp;s-celles, how the then German. Foreign. Secretary, Baron von Rotenham, was exciting himself over the controversy, while he (the Kaiser) had the Tsar&apos;s agreement in his pocket.     A similar trick was played in the appointment of Count Wel&amp;ersee to the Chief command of the Peking Expedition in 1900.     The appointment of Count itfal&amp;er-see was represented by the Kaiser as having been proposed by the Tsar, but the Russian Government publicly declared that this was not the case.    There could be no better revelation for neutrals of the Kaiser&apos;s methods than the republication, in pamphlet form, of M. Isvolsky&apos;s statement, together with the &quot;&lt;Villy-Mcky&quot; correspondence,5. Something like consternation must have been producedin Berlin by these fresh disclosures, coming in the midst of the &apos;American exposure of &quot;the Germa--; impressment of Sweden to forward her submarine and other correspondence in cypher through the Swedish Foreign Office.     Signs of this consternation are manifest in the German press.     The Vossische Zeitung, a thorough-going supporter of the war, oould find nothing better to say about Count luxburg, the Ger-aan Minister to the Argentine Republic, than that steps ought to he taken to make him &quot;vanish, without a trace*&apos; -I-uxburg&apos;s own suggestion for the treatment of Argentine vessels at the very moment when an arrangement was being negotiated for stopping the sinking of these ships by German submarines.    Three Berlin newspapers have been suppressed, probably on account of their comments on this case.     In order to distribute the pressure of the censorship with some show of equality the Deutsche Tages-geitung
itung, Count Reventlow&apos;s Pen-German organ, is one of the papers suppressed.    Another is the ?reisinnige Zeitung, which is, or used to be, the official organ of the old Radical Left, the party of Kerr Wiemer and of Eerr Mller, deputy for Meiningen.     It went beyond the ordinary journalistic terms of abuse in discussing president Wilson&apos;s reply to the Pope, and it remains to be seen whether its suppression is due to a desire not to carry denunciation of America too far or to some trenchant criticism of Count luxburg, the German Foreign Office, and the secret arrangements with Sweden.     All these incidents of the past week will undoubtedly come up in the Reichstag when it re-assembles on the 26th. Whether the lessons of the situation will really be driven home by the leaders of the Majority Parties remains to be seen.     The tendency to temporise is strong amongst the bourgeois Radicals, who do not want a really democratic Germany but a Germany in whioh the r own class would direct affairs.     On the other hand, the democratic majority of the Catholic Centre and the Majority Socialists, or, as they are sometimes called, the Governmental Socialists, are in an important sense pace-makers for each other In the great industrial constituencies of Rhenish Prussia and Westphalia, the Catholic leaders have to show themselves as critical of abuses and as eager for reform as the Social Democrats - if they would retain their seats.     In Rhenish Prussia the same thing holds true to a certain extent in the rivalry of the Catholic Centre and the National Liberals.Dr. Hans DelbrtLok has just been saying that, as a matter of fact, the German Government is much more sensitive to public opinion that the British or the American Government.     In a sense this may be true.     Even a pure autocracy - such as the late Tsardom - was always looking over its shoulder to see what the masses were doing or plotting.     T-^e German Emperor end his former Chancellor, Prince Billow, showed themselves great, if often unsuccessful, popularity hunters.   Delbrtick notes, in confirmation of
lias views, that the German reply to the Pope has been carefully I diooussed in the Free Committee of the Reichstag, while neither president Wilson nor any other of the Allied Governments have dealt with their replies in this &quot;democratic&apos;&apos; way.     It is certainly true that Reichstag debates on Foreign Affairs have a much wider range than debates on the same subject in France or England.     But the German debates are really not very intelligent or very searching.     If they were, we might just now expect the -deputies to insist upon knowing whether the Kaiser and his Government have a secret treaty with Sweden,     The Kaiserrs attentions for years past to the present King of Sweden, &quot;mein lieber Gustav&quot;, who, as Crown Prince, was frequently at the German Imperial manoeuvres, cannot, in -view of William II&apos;s character, have been disinterested.     It is ver,/ probable that he managed to &quot;bag11 something in that quarter.It would be interesting to know how far the result of the Swedish elections, not yet completely to hand, will enable   M. Branting&apos;s party to bring the Swedish Government to book. 5!he results up to date are:Socialists 48   Before the election    43Liberals 37      &quot;        &quot; &quot; 29Cpnsorvatives   30 &lt;     &quot;        &quot; &quot; 44Totals:-   7.15      &quot;        &quot; &quot;        116Up to last Friday (14 September) the Conservatives had lost 15 seats and the Socialists had gained 5.   Only the Conservatives venture to defend the Government in the matter of the cypher telegrams6. The economic situation in Germany - apart from thesufferings of the masses from scarcity and bad quality of food and from clothing difficulties, and apart from the terribly adverse foreign exchange rates - appears to be not unsatisfactory. The subscription for the new loan, which is the seventh, was
opened on Monday the 17 September and will close on or about the 19 October.     There is plenty of money available for the subscription.    Enormous fortunes have been made by government contractors.     The commercial classes have not been able to spend in the lavish way that was customary before the war.     Agriculture has been paying well.     Capital has been accumulating and is so plentiful that the banks are paying only some 2 per cent on deposits.     The Government has excogitated an ingenious plan, in view of the plentiful supply of money, for preparing for the loan.     It has been issuing special Exchequer-Bonds bearing interest at 4g per cent - that is to say one-eighth above the interest on the ordinary Exchequer Bonds.     These special bonds are all subject to compulsory conversion into the new loan at the end of September, the first instalment of the new loan being payable at the beginning of October.    This seems an excellent plan for obtaining early advantage of the money of those people who are contemplating subscription to the loan, and it fixei them in their intention to subscribe.The new 5 per cent loan - the seventh - is being issued at 98.    The Government is making it more popular by an express declaration to the effect that it will never reduce the interest without simultaneously offering to redeem the loan at par.A new series of Exchequer 4|- per cent Bonds is being issued at the same time as the new loan - also at 98,     These bonds are redeemable after 60 years, but the chance of a good premium is held out by drawings at stated intervals, the bonds so drawn being redeemed at 115.Enemy deposits in the hands of German bankers, or debts due to enemy creditors, are no Iff to be made subject to a payment of 5 per cent*interest to the Imperial Treasury.     This interest is to be held by the Treasury for the ultimate benefit of the enemy creditors.     It is also, doubtless, intended ss a weapon or a bait to induce enemy Governments to exhibit generosity
-lQ-in their ultimate settlement with German creditors of enemy debtors and with German holders of German capital deposited in enemy countries.A similar policy is* manifested in the way in which the Government proposes to deal with that important enterprise, the Imperial (British) Gas Works in Berlin.     (It was an English Company worked largely by English managers, which supplied Berlin with gas).     The Government proposes to sell the Gas Works, for the ultimate benefit of the British Company, to the Berlin Municipality for a sum of 87,200,000 marks (at pre-war exchange about  4,360,000).    The Berlin Municipal authorities describe this price as excessive - it is probably a good deal below the real value of the concern - and they desire to offer only 58,500,000 marks (about  2,425,000 at pre-war exchange rates).    The Government defendB its proposal on the ground that these Gas-Works form the most valuable British property in Germany and constitute an important pledge in German hands for the favourable treatment of German property in England.     It is at the same time expressly admitted that the British Government has hitherto &quot;behaved correctly&quot; in the liquidation of the Germs* Banks and other enterprises in England, though the same cannot be affirmed of the British. Colonial Governments.     German. Imperial interests must, it is urged, take precedence of Berlin Municipal interests in this matter.G.S. 19.9.17.
