SECRET.11SUMMARY   of   OPERATIONS for   AUGUST,    1917..Br itisli Force .Owing to the extended front now held by four divisions offensive operations have been necessarily limited to small local actions.     Those on the Struma front have been of almost daily occurrence.On the Doiran-Vardar front destructive bombardments of hostile gun positions have been carried out but the results cannot be considered wholly satisfactory owing to the lack of sufficiently heavy ordnance.On August 2nd the detachment, consisting of 500 all ranks East Yorkshire Regiment, arrived at Salonika from Old Greece.     As this force had been located in an unhealthy locality I sent it to a Convalescent Camp by the sea for a short time before returning to the front.On August 9th I received orders that, as a result of the Paris Conference, one British division was to be withdrawn from the Salonika Army and sent to Egypt.I thereupon decided to withdraw my left division (26th) and informed General Sarrail to this effect, asking him if he could relieve this division.     He replied that it was impossible for him to do so and that I must continue to hold my present front with such troops as I had available.    I consequently then decided to withdraw the 10th Division from the Struma front and despatch it to Egypt, as a result of which the following reorganisation of the P&apos;orce became necessary12th Corps now consists of the 22nd and 26th Divisions, 16th Corps consists of the 27th and 28th Divisions.     I also had no alternative but to place the 228th Brigade again in the front line, where they now are, under the orders of G.0.C., 16th Corps.The/ &apos;
2.The withdrawal of the 10th Division commenced on August 19th, and in order to fill the gap left in the front line bythis withdrawal I ordered the 12th Corps to extend to the right as far as the line GL0B0STICA     AKBUSALIK - &quot;Hill 634 - SNEVCE -SPAWC River - to SARIKUEY, which is now the boundary between the two Corps,On August 11th I received orders from General Sarrail to prepare for a strong artillery demonstration accompanied by local raids on the DOIRAN-VARDAR front, which was to be partof a similar operation to be undertaken by the Serbian, Italian and French troops on a subsequent date.    In pursuance of later orders my bombardment of the enemy positions on this front began on August 25th and was continued with increasing intensity until the 31st.   The Royal Flying Corps co-operated by bombing hostile dumps at PLATANENWALB and ST0JAK0V0.      On the night of the 30th/31st raids were carried out at several points between Lake Doiran and P. ridge.    In spite of considerable opposition our troops entered the hostile trenches and secured prisoners.   These operations were followed up by heavy hostile bombardment and counter-attacks on our positions on Hill 380 and P.4j=r, which however were unsuccessful, AvlatioruAir raids have been carried out almost daily by our aeroplanes, climatic conditions&apos; having been very suitable. Observation, however, at times has been difficult owing to the thick ground haze.On August 4th news was received from Thasos that the aerodrome there, belonging to the R.N.A.S., had been heavily bombed by hostile seaplanes.    I offered a bombing squadron of the R.F.C, to the Vice-Admiral to carry out, in conjunction with the R.N.A.S., a raid in retaliation on the enemy seaplane base at GEREVIZ, S.W. of XAHTHT.   This raid was carried out on August 11th by R.F.C. and R.N.A.S. machines, and 1410 lbs ofhigh/
high explosive were dropped on the enemy aerodrome early in the morning with good results.     A few hours later another raid was undertaken on the same target when 1940 lbs of bombs were dropped.     Direct hits were obtained on hangars and fires were started.       All our machines returned safely.On August 22nd, at the request of the French, 12 of our aeroplanes bombed. PRILBP, where the headquarters of the XI German Army are situated.      During this raid one of our escorting machines was brought down and other pilots were wounded.Other important localities bombed during the. month are DUTLI, DEMIRHISSAR, SaRMUSAKLI, DRAMA, and the aerodrome at LIVWOVO. Other .Forces.Prior to the. operations referred to as having taken place on the Doiran front, nothing of any importance occurred on the remainder of the Allied front until the end of the month. During the 29/30th the enemy, probably in retaliation to our bombardment, heavily shelled the French positions on aLCAK MAH, vest of the VARDAR, and a subsequent hostile raid succeeded in penetrating the French front line at one point in this area, but v/as subsequently ejected with loss.     On the 30th the Serbs made some slight progress south of DOBROPOLJE, capturing 70 prisoners and two machine guns, but, in face of heavy counterattacks, have been unable to maintain their position and have now withdrawn to their original line.On the same date the Italians sei.&apos;ed the summit of Hill 1050 in the CERNA LOOP, and captured 30 Germans.     Their position was, however, rendered untenable under heavy bombardment, and they have also withdrawn to their own trenches. General.On August 18th at about 4 p.m. a fire broke out in the Turkish quarter of the town of Salonika, and owing to a highwind/
wind from the northwest rapidly spread east and southeast. Lack of water and the shortage of fire engines made it impossible to check the flames.   By 9 p.m.   it was evident that the whole town was in danger of total destruction.   During the whole night the fire raged.     Houses were blown down with explosive in an attempt to confine the fire to as small an area as possible, but owing to the crowds in the streets this operation was very difficult.     The fire spread from north of Egnatia Street to the sea front, and from just west of French?Headquarters to 200 yards west of the White Tower,Allied troops and motor lorries worked all night assisting in the removal of the refugees and their impedimenta and took them to Kalamaria and Karaissi,Buildings occupied by British units and destroyed were Army Base Post Office, Police Barracks, P.M. office,- Base Headquarters, and a building which contained a portion of the Base Depot Medical Stores.      All documents and a portion of the stores were saved.By the next day the fire had considerably abated but was still burning fiercely in the west of the town. It was not completely extinguished until the fourth day.A number of the civilian population estimated at 60,000 wore rendered homeless.     At a conference of representatives of the Allied Armies it was decided that all persons whose houses were destroyed should be cleared from the town, to avoid overcrowding with its attendant danger of outbreak of epidemics, and placed In concentration camps      Three of these camps were formed by the British Army, where accommodation and rations are provided for 5,500 persons. Adminlstration.Lieutenant-General H.M.Lawson, G.B., accompanied by Brigadier-General L. &quot;.&apos;.Atelier ley, G.M.G. ,M.V.0., arrived in Salonika on 30th July 1917, and left en route for Malta on 22ndAugus t
August 1917.    A report on &quot;Man Power&quot; In the BritishSalonika Force was drawn up.The efforts which are being made to effect economiesand to save shipping are now beginning to bear fruit..The manufacture of soap in the Base Ordnance Depot is now being carried out on an extensive scale.The erection of a plant to deal with the recovery of glycerine is proceeding, and when the work is complete it is anticipated that a considerable quantity of glycerine will be extracted for dispatch to Great Britain, Health of Troops..There has been, as was inevitable with the advance of the malaria season, an increase of the amount of sickness, but in comparison with August 1916 the improvement in the health of the troops has been very considerable in spite of the fact that the temperature has averaged 5  higher this year.The admissions to hospitals and casualty clearing stations for all diseases have been 12.2^ of strength, as compared with 16*2% in August 1916.     The majority of cases have been recurrent malaria.Dysentery and diarrhoea account for 6 + 6% and malaria and other fevers of 61-3$ of the patients., as compared with 17-2# and 7.O..9% respectively last year.(Sgd..)
