No. 1338.

In an interview with newspaper correspondent General Klembovski has stated that, during the Riga operations, 2 infantry divisions and 1 cavalry division, which have all the arti11ery of the 12th army, fought splendidly and that 1 infantry division and 2 brigades offered no resistance, to the enemy. He refused to give any opinion of other units until an enquiry, now being held has issued its finding. He said that in spite of the German artillery fire at Ixhull history can furnish no other instance, wherein an army has succeeded, almost without loss, in crossing in broad daylight a water obstacle of the width of the Dvina, in the oourse of from 2 to 3 hours.

In infantry units he said that there had been a very large percentage of deserters, who threw away their rifles abd blocked the roads, and trains going in an Ea? direction.
