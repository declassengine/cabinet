fWTS TflnUMT IQB PHQB5RTY OF HIS BRT TANNIC MAJESTY1S GO vlSRNMMT).-:V MR,cabins:  G.T.2016^    .    Ignition of claims  m organizations outside1(See- also War CaHnir221, minute &apos;Kr^ra/TT&apos;Tapers 1731 and 1732.)(1) The official recognition of Associations representingthe Post Offioe staff was conceded by Lord Buxton in 1906, and elaborate rules have sinoe been evolved prescribing the conditions under which an Association may be recognised and the suojects upon which they may make representations.    The main object of these rules is to secure (1; that no grade shall be represented by more than one.Association* (2) that there should be some community of interest between the grades included in a single&apos;Association* and (3) that supervising officers shall not combine in the same Association as the rank and file.   Under this system some 55 Associations have been formed, representing all the large and most of the smaller classes of Postal Servants. - s-(2) In the Post Office Factories and Engineering Department there are a small number of artisans paid at the rates agreed between masters and men for similar work in -private employment*    In these cases the outside Trade Unions have some locus standi and Postmasters &quot;General have Accepted representations from them.    With this exception, the Department has not dealt with outside Trade Unions as to the conditions of service of its own employees.::(3) The question now at issue is whether the Conciliation &quot; and Arbitration Board should accept ap-oeals from outside Trade Unions. The Board&apos;s terms of reference contemplate prelirajra^^;negotiations   ?     between the;employees1 representatives and the Department concerned, and if the outside Unions are given a locus standi the Government Department Hust necessarily be prepared to negotiate with them.    This would be a first step towards giving outside Unions the right of intervention onall conditions of Government, service, and neither the Arbitration Board nor the Departments could befeure that appeals-submitted by them represented the views of the Service organisation or of tne majority of jhe class concerned.    On some questions their policies might be in direct conflict. -/      :scontent^ could beuje classes it represents, and its hands might be forced by a di ea minority by threats of secession to any witside Union which cuiuu ue S5U2?    x        UP their case     It would be eaually inconvenient to the ^partment which would never be serture&apos;egainst agreement arrived at with one tody being repudiated by another which was not a party to it.   Where we57lce Association exists it would be preferable to stimulate the urination of one by refusing a locus standi to an outside body.
{5)     From a &quot;wider point of view it is undesirable that Government employees should &quot;bo .encouraged to &quot;become members of outside Trade Unions.     Their Conditions of employment such as *oey, pension, sicli leave,, etc. are different and as a rule iiore favourable than the. conditions of outside&apos; labour, end it would be disastrous if Government servants by becoming members of ordinary Trade unions were .entangled in disputes, and possibly strikes, upon questions .with which:&quot;they are not&apos;in any way concerned.     And it would be a valuable asset to any Union or combination of Unions which contemplated a strike on a large scale if they could call out the Post Office .servants and paralyse the communication of the Country.     If the outside Trade Unions ere refused a right of access either to the Arbitration Board or the Department, membership- will be much less: attractive to Government servants.  (6) &apos; The appearance of outside Unions &quot;before the Arbitration Board.may stimulate e movement, of .which there has already been some symptoms in- favour, of the combination, by affiliation&quot; or : V otherwise, of the Service Associations with existing Trade Unions. ThiB again would tend to involve Government servants in outside disputes and is open to other obsections touched upon by the Eoyel Commission;.:; ^.; V~.V(7) It is submitted that&apos;if arbitration is to have a permanent place in the settlement of wages and conditions of service  of Government employees, the proper line:of developmentis rather in &quot;-the;direction of encouragirg. the formation of Departmental or Service: Associations,- which.wi^ll have, direct and detached knowledge of the questions at issue&apos;, .:and;.if necessary establishing an organised system ;ot official recognition on the lines already in operation/in the Pest Off ice   which will ensure that one body and one onLy is entitied to speak for each grade.   ;Any step in the direction of admitting the locus standi of outside ?J?r&amp;de Unions leads in the opposite direction and may be extremely difficult to retrace.     This does not of course-apply to Government servants .employed on the terms and conditions obtaining In the outside labour market, who are on a different footing and are&apos; excluded from the/purview of the Arbitration Board by the terms of its reference. ..
