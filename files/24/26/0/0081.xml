THIS SMJMSm 13 THE ;2RQP3HTY 0? HIS- BfilTAifflXQ MAJESTY13 50VERBMBIjT&gt;3 3 0 R E T G.T.-2081g A a     0 A BIO Ti   .CUH3ITI0H QP IRELAND. Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.Sinn Fein becoraoo less a practical menace to the peace of the Unite:! Kingdom as its exponents and their intentions-and wishes become more thoroughly known.    Ita prinoipal spokesmen shew a growing consciousness that the maBS of their countrymen do not desire a new rebellion.   They attract great crowds in the country towns when Sunday by Sunday thsy carry on their propaganda, and the number of their clubs grows every week, there being now nearly six hundred clubs with a membership approaching.forty thousand.     The agitation as a whole, however, appears in an increasing degree to develop toward the kind oi nationalism which was formerly preached by Mr. Parnell and away from physical force revolutions.    The spokesmen seek by occasional Violent speedhes to propitiate the men of the Irish Republican Brotherhood who are still to bo found in considerable strength in most of the Irish counties, but thoy taice special and increasing care to satisfy the generality of the electors that they are not in truth advooates of violence, with the result that there is growing uncertainty as to whether they have any definite political aims.   On a reoeht occasion in Uor.egal, as I am told. tix, John MactteiU was questioned es to hie intentions in osse a schema of self-government on dominion lines should be
- -2 ~produced &quot;by the Convention, and said he should no doubt acquiesoe in it.   His most active colleagues are also causing it to be represented that the real extremists in Irish politics, are people who work in the dark and whose,intentions the Sinn Fein leaders are defeating.The chief importance of the establishment of the Sinn. Fein organisation in all the constituences which is being rapidly pressed forward is that it will provide for an assembly of delegateg in Dublin which is intended to be held during October, and which will have soine claim to be considered the representative of a national organisation.   Bearing in mind the proceedings of like bodies which existed Under Mr. Parnellfs leadership, and in more recent times, and the fact that the Nationalist party   is organised in opposition to Sinn Fein, the threatened Sinn Fein assembly does hot appear to me a very alarming possibility.Cardinal Logue and other Roman Catholic Bishops, and some well known Roman Catholic clergy have in the past week or two been more outspoken than heretofore in condemnation of revolutionary societies of every kind, with the result that open signs of insubordination are being shewn by a few of tht young; r clergy &apos;who have most directly associated themselves with the de   Valera agitation.Sir Bryan Mahon informs mo that drilling has virtually deasec in all countiec   except Clare, and is there much diminished in extent since the recent prosecutions.   The Inspector General of the Royal Irish Constabulary also reports good results from these proceedings.   Denunciations of the Irish administration for &quot;provocative&quot; action /
oalculated to thwart the objects of the Convention are made for platform purposes by speakers whose reputations are dependent upon their being in opposition to the Government, end  n article in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; of London which recently presented the same nonsensical accusation is being made the tert for a good deal of newspaper criticism, and was touched upon this week in a speech of the Lord Mayor of Dublin, at the meeting of the City Council.     Conversations which I have had with some of the complainants and enquiries I have made satisfy me that: political display is the object of most of these attacks, and I am convinced that the somewhat stringent action of the police and Military Authorities, which was necessary in the interests of order, has not in any way prejudiced the fortunes of the Convention.Everywhere there is keen interest in the proceedings of the Convention and a growing belief in the possibility that it may find a solution of the Irish difficulty..    In this &apos;respect public opinion has changed to a remarkable extent. My own present apprehension is that a too sanguine view is growing up.     The Convention meets next week in Cork, and its arrival is being prepared for by the Sinn Fein party by the holding of meetings on Sunday.     I do not see any reason for fear that there will bo serious disturbances or that the meeting of the Convention will be interfered with, but proper precautions will bo taken.During extended journeys which I have made, in the course of the last two weeks&apos; in various parts of Ireland I Have seen for myself the condition of the crops in the Northern, Eastern, Western and Midland counties.    My own observation and the information I collected have satisfied me that the harvest will be a great deal better than there was .......
lately reason to hope.     The Oats generally which were in July a record growth will he saved to good advantage.   The yield of potatoes is excellent and will no doubt be beyond that in any recent year.(Initialled)     B.E.D.19th September 1917.
