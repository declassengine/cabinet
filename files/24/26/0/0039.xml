3. Kerenski has appointed himself Commander in Chief and Alexei Chief of Staff.  They have issued orders to the effect that all ?niloff&apos;s orders, except those relating te movements of troops to ? and to Don, are to be obeyed. Alexeiff explained by telegraph to Korniloff that he had only accepted the post of Chief of Staff 

because he regarded this as the only means of saving the situation. He cones here by a special train immediately, Korniloff&apos;s troops under General Krimev stand round Petrograd, but as far as is known have taken no action. Korniloff is trying to communicate with ? at NOVOCHERCASK, but is (being delayed) continually.   Practically no news comes to STAVKA. Kerenski has given way in this that he now communicates) with Komiloff, whereas yesterday he stated that he would not have dealings with rebels. On North and Smith West fronts situation is very serious. Both these staffs are in the hands of the Committees, and transport and supply is so disorganised that there is danger of a lack of food. Korniloff&apos;s orders and circulars are reported to have been issued in majority of large towns, but they are not allowed in the Army. Telegraphs and most of the railways obey Korniloff&apos;s orders but are under control of Committees. Nothing has been heard as yet as to the conditions agreed on between Alexeieff and Kerenski. Politically speaking, I venture pronounce an opinion not shared by my military colleagues, that the new combination offers a very favourable outlook from the point of view of the Allies, provided Kerenski is, as I believe him to be, honest in his intentions. Alexeieff would not, in my opinion, consent to be virtua1 Ommander in Chief urder Korenski, unless the latter

has
lias made satisfactory concessions. If this is the (? case), it means that Kerenski has decided definitely to lean on the military party, and that he must soon come into violent conflict with the BOLSHIVIK, to which the Soldiers and Workmens1  Committee will probably immediately rally. Kerenski and the military party must then prevail, Issuing of orders in Kerenski&apos;s name must produce a favourable effect if he shows himself honest and determined. I think, therefore, that it is urgently important that the Allies should immediately and solemnly impress on Kerenski that the salvation of Russia and his renown in history depend on acquiescence with the demands of the military chiefs. The Allies should also be thoroughly made to recognise that the one indispensable condition for the success of the new combination is the complete suppression of the Bolshivik mob, which is composed only of wild idealists or downright traitors.     They should endeavour to convince Kerenski that this should form the basis of his immediate policy, and. his predominant present objective, I am of opinion also that some steps should be taken to endeavour to-safeguard Korniloff, to whose patriotic and determined action any favourable results will be primarily due.
