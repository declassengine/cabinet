From Viceroyl 20th September 1917.(Received 21st, 10 a.m.)1412J. We desire to review existing conditions in Persia in the light of enemy plans communicated to us in your telegram of the 3rd instant and your telegram of the 6th. instant.(2) It seems improbable that Russia will be able to hinder effectively the enemy plans either by diplomacy or force and on this assumption we appreciate enemy execution of his plan as follows : (1) Movement on a broad front using any or all of routes via Azerbaijanto Tehran ; via passes south of Lake Urumia to Hamadan and via Ki&apos;sr-i-Sbirin to Hamadan.(2) A concentration in the area of Hamadan-Tehran whence roads leadfirst via Tehran and Meshed to Herat; secondly, via Ispahan-Nain-Gunabad to Kain; thirdly-, via Ispahan-Yezd-Kerman-Bam to Seistan and the Helmand. Of these want of supplies prohibits use of number two for anything but patrols. Number one is the best supplied, is the furthest from British influence, and is the shortest way to Herat, number three disturbs Bakhtiaris and South Persia, districts likely to provide levies and recruits to the invading force but presents supply difficulties.(3) Movement on Afghanistan either in force or in small parties or mostprobably both.3. To counter this plan the political means at our disposal seems to us to be a change of policy in Persia. The only prospect of rendering the Persian Government at once disposed and in a position to co-operate with us in hindering the enemy&apos;s plans seems to lie in our being able to demonstrate that so far from harbouring designs on Persia&apos;s independence we sincerely desire in our own interests to see her selfTsufficient and strong. A change of policy on the lines already advocated by us on political grounds seems to us therefore a pressing military necessity. This may seem Utopian at this late hour but we may be able the more easily to influence through subsidies and other inducements the Bakhtiaris, Soulet and Qawam, Farman Farma and other Persian leaders to support us.4. The military precautions now possible are:   (a) the development of our intelligence system throughout western Persia and in this the support of local notables suggested above will much; assist; (b) the effective recognition of the South Persia Rifles by the Persian Government as a direct result of (3) with a view to securing their subsequent co-operation with us in support of our joint interests. We might endeavour to surmount Persia&apos;s objections to South Persia Rifles in so far as these are based on trust to amour propre by agreeing to a Persian General in command, with competent British officers as advisers ; (c) the improvent of communications, /  in which connection we are addressing you once more about the extension of Dalbandin Railway to Marjawa, while a project for the betterment of Bunder Abbas-Saidabad-Kerman road is now with ycu.5. Now that information is hardening as to the imminence of hostilities penetrating Persia and of that country becoming a war area, the tranquility of India and her frontiers depends on prompt and adequate co-ordination and utilisation of all our potentialities in Persia, whether political or military. We believe time has now come to regard Persia as a war area in which all action and policy should be co-ordinated under direct control of the War Cabinet.
