G.T.-1912, G.T.-1932, and G.T.-1997, 1 beg to submit for the consideration of the War Cabinet the two enclosed Minutes which have been prepared for me by Sir William Weir, the Controller of Aeronautical Supplies, and by Sir John Hunter, the Director of Steel Production.w. s. c.September 14, 1917.I 978 1 j
RtkBoeument is the Property of His Britannic Majestpl GpyernmfiBt.]r\V\VPrinted for the War Cabinet. September 1917.SECRET.MINUTE FROM SIR WILLIAM WEIR, DIRECTOR OF AERONAUTICALSUPPLIES.I HAVE considered the proposals for the extension of production of rigid and non-rigid airships, and these appear to represent demands on British industry of the following character: (a.) The supply of 20,000 tons of structural steel at the rate of 500 tons perweek over a period of 40 weeks. (&amp;.) The necessary contractors&apos; labour, steel erectors and riveters and strongmale labour for the erection of sheds to be built from above material. (c.) A demand for hydrogen-producing plant on a large scale, involving themanufacture of compressors, silicol conversion plant, gas bottles, &amp;c. (d.) A large supply of aluminium in the form of duralumin for rigidstructures.(e.) The supply of, say, 171 aero-type engines, that is, 4 per ship for 11 ships, plus 22 spare engines, equals 66 for rigid airships, and 2 per ship for 35 non-rigid airships, plus 35 spare engines, equals 105 for non-rigid airships.(/.) The manufacture and supply of the necessary transmission gear, control gear, instruments, guns, bomb-dropping gear for, say, 11 rigid and 35 non-rigids.(g.) The supply of the necessary labour for the manufacture of rigid and non-rigid airships complete with motors and gondola frames. (Note. In estimating the number of non-rigids, 1 have taken 70 as an establishment and a wastage rate of 35 per annum.)(h.) Supplies&apos;of fabric, dope, tubing, strainers, tierods, cables, &amp;c, required for above.(i.) While I am unaware of the personnel required for handling and working the above, it is apparent that such personnel to a large extent would require to be recruited from skilled trades.I have had no opportunity of studying the constructional details of rigid or non-rigid airships, and am therefore ignorant of the details of supply involved, and accordingly can only give my views as affecting aeronautical supply in the broadest industrial aspects of the proposal.  My views are as follows: 1. There is an acute shortage of steel for every essential war purpose at present,for example, approximately 6,000 tons of structural steel are immediately required for the erection of four large aeroplane factories, and a number of extensions to existing factories. Over 30 additional aerodromes with necessary sheds and very large aeroplane storage sheds are now in course of construction to provide instructional facilities for pilots and to house aeroplanes produced during the winter season when weather conditions may prevent them flying overseas for indefinite periods. The speed of carrying out these enormous programmes is entirely dependent on the supply of steel and on contractors&apos; labour.2. The situation at present with regard to the manufacture of oxygen andhydrogen and their storage in bottles is extremely acute. The demands for oxygen for the manufacture of aeroplane parts, together with the demand by other Supply Departments is so great that I have been compelled to ask you to take over the entire control and allocation of oxygen. [978]
One of the factors in the scheme is the acute shortage of bottles or containers, and naturally additional hydrogen apparatus will impose still further limitations in this respect. The manufacture of hydrogen compressors and silicol plants for the production of hydrogen will all entail a demand on the skilled labour market. There has already been experienced a somewhat acute shortage of silicol, and as this product has to be imported from Canada, the natural increase from existing sources of demand, such as the Expeditionary Force and Naval demands, will probably continue to render the situation difficult, apart altogether from the proposed new demands.3. While I am unable to state that Aeronautical Supplies are short ofaluminium or duralumin, any increased demand might render the situation difficult.4. With regard to supply of aero-engines, while the numbers involved in theAdmiralty proposals are not great, it must be remembered that every engine means an efficient aeroplane less in service.5. While not conversant with the exact details, I am thoroughly convinced thatthe manufacture and supply of transmission gear, control gear, together with the fitting up and assemblage of gondola equipment, actually involves the utilisation of a considerable amount of highly skilled engineering labour, all of which is urgently required at present for the manufacture of jigs and fixtures to enable additional unskilled labour to be employed for the production of increased numbers of aero-engines.6. While the actual manufacture of rigid and non-rigid ships may belargely carried out by female labour, this must involve a fairly large supervisory staff of skilled male labour.With regard to the items mentioned in paragraph (h.), while it is possible that they represent in detail material which would not be available for the construction of aeroplanes, yet the facilities employed could reasonably be converted and utilised for heavier-than-air requirements.Generally, I am convinced that the demands indicated involve an additional call on the manufacturing resources of the country at a moment when aeronautical supply is being called on to make an enormous expansion, and the influence of this demand will, without the shadow of a doubt, have a great effect on retarding the rate of acceleration in construction of aeroplanes and aero-engines.MINUTE FROM SIR JOHN HUNTER, DIRECTOR OF STEELPRODUCTION.THE question of building certain steel structures, about 900 feet long, for the construction of large airships, was under discussion with contractors for six months before the contracts were let. The contract for the Flookburgh shed was let in February, 1917, and at that date the contractors estimated that the shed would be completed in eighteen months&apos; time.In the Flookburgh shed the quantity of steel estimated by the contractors is 10,000 tons, of which only 170 tons have been now delivered, leaving a balance of 9,830 tons yet to be made.The quality of steel required for these airship sheds, as specified by the Admiralty, is exactly of the same quality as is used in mercantile shipbuilding.The whole plea of the Admiralty to get preference in steel was based on the necessity for the shipbuilding programme.In March of this year the Prime Minister&apos;s attention was called to six sheds that were contemplated by the Admiralty for the purpose referred to above, and I had a letter from his Secretary telling me that the whole six sheds had been turned down on account of the shortage of steel.As the airship sheds were now stopped,. I got in touch with the contractors for the Flookburgh ones, namely, Sir Wm. Arrol and Co., Ltd., and arranged very
large contracts for steel works extensions, and also for the very important scheme for the re-construction of Messrs. Harland and Wolff&apos;s various yards, in order to increase the output of standard ships. This instruction was conveyed in a Cabinet Minute from Lord Pirrie to me, with Dr. Addison&apos;s sanction.In the first place, if the contractors for the Flookburgh sheds are compelled to go on with the sheds, then the re-construction of Harland and Wolff&apos;s various yards would be seriously affected, not to speak of the extensions which Arrol&apos;s people have for steelworks extensions, not only for the manufacture of shipbuilding material but also for the Ministry&apos;s gun programme.In this one shed, as I have already stated, there are 10,000 tons of material, which should give four standard ships of a considerable tonnage for which the steel is available which could be in the wrater and in trade in from six to eight months&apos; time, whereas the time now required for the completion of this Zeppelin shed will be from twenty to twenty-four months, and the time required for the construction of the airships would further require to be taken into.account.The urgency of the Admiralty programme has always been put before the Ministry of Munitions on account of the vital requirements for new ships, and taking that view of it, in order to help the Admiralty, I have held back work such as the railway rolling stock, &amp;c, which is desperately needed, so as to assist the Admiralty shipbuilding programme.The Steel Superintendent in. the Clyde district has already been instructed by the Admiralty to give a certain tonnage for the airship shed, but as the tonnage of steel required for shipbuilding is not sufficient to meet the requirements, he has given shipbuilding, up to the present, his preference. However, instructions should now be given, if this is the wish of the War Cabinet, that this order is either to be cancelled or indefinitely postponed.I also have plans before me for new aeroplane-building sheds, and for the wide spans required steel construction must be used. The steel in the Flookburgh shed could be used for the aeroplane buildings.The question for decision is the relative priority to be assigned to shipbuilding, aeroplanes, and airships.
