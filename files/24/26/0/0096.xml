ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH.l2- September 1917.Enolosure.Sir,DESTRUCTION OF RATS. I an directed by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to transmit to you herewith for your information a copy of a ciroular letter on the above subject whioh has been addressed to County Counoila and District Committees throughout Scotland.     If in the opinion of your Committee it is deoirable that immediate steps should be taken in their district for the destruction of rate, the Board would suggest that the Local Authority should be approached on the subject.During the past two years the Board have been asked by several District Agricultural Committees to give financial assistance to schemes for the destruction not only of rats but of other agricultural pests such ae wood-pigeons3 gulls, sparrows and rabbits.     The funds at present at the disposal of the Board are available only for schemes of rat destruction and consequently they are not in a position to assist projects which are intended to reduce the numbers of other pests whioh arc known to inflict damage on farm produce.     In this connection, however, the Board desire me to draw your attention to that part of the circular which indicates the Bources from which the expenditure on schemesOf /The Secretary, District AgriculturalExecutive Committee,
of rat destruction may be defrayed.     It will b  notedthat Local Authorities may charge part of the expenseseither to the Public Health General Assessment or to theEquivalent Grant.     The Board understand, however, thatwhile the former may be drawn upon only for expensesincurred in destroying rats, the Equivalent Grant may,if the sanction of the Secretary for Scotland be obtained,be applied on grounds of publio utility to schemesembracing measures for the oxterraination of other agriculturalpests.While the Board tako the view that the question of dealing with the rat pest is the more urgent they would not wish to deter Committees in proceeding with larger schemes in areas y/here the need for attaoklng other farm pests has bec.. mo serious.     As, however, the Committees have no funds of their own to enable them to undertake ouch schemes it would be advisable that they should keep in view the limits imposed upon Local Authorities in the giving of assistance from publio funds, and while the full grant promised by the Board to schemes devoted entirely bo the destruction of rats would be forthcoming they could only assist composite schemes to the extent of a proportion of the expenditure incurred solely in destroying rats.I am. Sir,  Your obedient Servant, H.M. OOKACHER,Secretary.

In certain districts in Scotland the extent of the damage thus caused has led the District Committees or the County Councils to organise schemes for the destruction of these posts and it has now been decided to invite Local Authorities generally throughout the country to take similar action.     Tho Board are of opinion that if satisfactory and permanent results are to be obtained it is essential that measures should be adapted generally over a wide area such as that covered by the operations of a County Council or District Committee and further that the effectiveness of any scheme carried on by one of these bodies would be considerably Increased if other Looal Authorities in contiguous areas could be prevailed upon to take similar action.     It is hoped therefore that Local Authorities throughout the country will give the subject serious consideration.measures TO BE ADOPTEDt- With a view to affordingLocal /BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND,29 ST.
