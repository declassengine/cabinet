COPY NO.15.9.17.2CIRCULATED FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE VifAR CABINET.Extracts from a letter from the General Officer Commanding Salonika, to C.I.G.S., dated 25th August, 1917.The three first French divisions which came out here first are said to be very weak owing to the new ministerial decree of 30 days&apos; leave for all who are entitled to it,that some 20,000 men are already on leave while more are going.   The Colonial divisions are fairly strong but being composed chiefly of black troops are, in my opinion, of little value. They may work up enough enthusiasm for a short attack but will never stand the strain of a defensive battle.   So long as I had five divisions I regarded my army as preferable to the whole of the Allies put together,The Italian 35th Division is about 45,000 strong of which about 20,000 must be infantry and machine guns,   They are in A.l condition, hold a short front, and refuse to lengthen their line.      From a defensive point of view they are scarcely pulling their full weight though possibly their front is an important one.       The Sorb forces are a mystery. With a ration strength of132,000 the actual strength of the army is said to be only 00,000,with a base and L.of C. of 15,000.     19,000 out of 80,000 are given as effective bayonets.       With this strength they have been given an absurdly long front to hold as comparing with the French and Italians.    I spent a night last week at the advanced Serbian Headquarters with the Crown Prince.       At first the situation was a little difficult as he appeared depressed and preoccupied,butxXXirrespective of the strength of the units.It is said
but I had a long and confidential talk with him by himself later on and was, I think, able to cheer him up a little and give him some ideas on the wider strategy of the war. The Serbs are greatly depressed at the withdrawal of a division by Great Britain in whom they place implicit trust, ife says his own army is tired, and dispirited and little able to withstand an attack in force.     The time he most dreads is the winter when operations will have ceased on other fronts and possibly stronger forces may be brought against us here,     I asked him if his army was in the same condition as during the attacks of last year: he replied they were far from it.     Possibly it might be a question for consideration whether, in the event of stronger forces being brought against us here during tho winter and operations elsewhere having died down, to transfer some British troops here to resist such attacks. I honestly do not put much trust in the heterogeneous army west of the Vardar.     I had a good, look at the country and was greatly struck with what the Serbs had accomplished last year.     No one but men fighting for their homes and accustomed to mountain warfare could have achieved what they did.     Luckily for them the Bulgarian positions were not entrenched and had they had sufficient troops they might have pushed the enemy to the Vardar. It must be- remembered that the Serbian rank and file are semi-savages - Incidentally so are the Bulgars - and what they can achieve cannot be done by a bown-bred modern army.     Now they are up&quot; against entrenched positions in the mountains, held by men armed with modern Instruments of warfare and, if it is true that in mountain warfare the personal equation has more opportunity than on flat ground^, still the initial break cannot be made by man-poweralone
alone but by the concentrated forces of guns and ammunition.     I was greatly struck by the common sense of the Crown Prince in talking to him alone.   He is quite clear on the necessity of playing the waiting game here and of the inadvisability of operations in this theatre except in conjunction with the Roumanians and Russian operations in the north.     The only thing that really upsets him is the possibility of an attack in the winter and his lack of reliance on the forces west of the Vardar. His implicit faith in the powers of the British army is almost childish.   He is unfortunately surrounded by hot-heads, not always Serbian, whose hearts at times rule their heads and who are carried away by the idea of a glorious and triumphant   march through Serbia.   Strangely enough the Serbians appear to have little hatred for the Bulgarians except in so far as the ruling power in Bulgaria is concerned.   The Greeks, said to consist of 18,000   infantry are either protecting Venizelos in Athens or interpolated in the French divisions, nominally for training purposes.xx xAs regards my own army everything is well. The health of the troops is excellent.       The men themselves are looking extraordinarily well and very cheerful only too anxious to be given more active employment. The general moral is of the highest and General Lawson, who has just left, expressed his appreciation of the high state of discipline and appearance of all ranks, the excellent administrative arrangements medical and otherwise and the general cheerfulness of everyone he saw. It would be fortunate if some of the arm-chair critics in England would come out herefor
for the benefit of their health.   We have been lucky in having a slightly cooler summer than last year though at the present moment it is no cooler, and we have had two months without rain; but while I give every credit to the medical services and to senior officers for what they have done, the chief credit is due to the regimental and junior medical officers and to the N.C.Os and men themselves who now fully realise that the numerous orders issued are for their own benefit and they themselves do everything they can to keep themselves in health.     The mosquito curtain is now looked upon as an equally Important article of equipment as the rifle or spade, and you would be amused to see the care with which sentries even in the hills put on their masks and gloves at sundown in order to run no unnecessary risks.The withdrawal of a division and consequent moves will rather spoil our record owing to many men unfit for long marches having to go to hospital, but before this took place the daily sick per 100 of the five divisions in the front line had been reduced to under .3,   Unfortunately in the base the percentage is higher, possibly due to the number of unfit men. The system of hospitals and convalescent camps for men and officers, even for nursing sisters. is as perfect as can be devised and I have no hesitation in saying that I infinitely prefer having the sick here under my own eye than sending them to Malta as by a system of progressive physical training we are able to get them quicker back to their units.       Unfortunately General Whitehead owing to the age rule is leaving me.    I trusthis
this services will be fully recognised when he gets home. I am anxious that Colonel Holt should succeed him as I have full confidence in his ability and energy also in his nerve - a desideratum since the publication of the Mesopotamia Commission,My defences are gradually going on but of course one cannot make them like those in Prance with a small army and a long front.        Communications, especially cross-communications, were of the first importance.     These are, I think, now nearly completed.x x xAs regards the defensive arrangements of the other armies I have great difficulty in arriving at any conclusion.     The only instructions issued by General Sarrailfs Staff that I have seen are too childish for words and are more suitable to be given by a company commander to a platoon leader.General Sarrail talks cheerily of holding the front lightly with strong reserves, but what appears trO ai the difficulty is the lack of means of moving these strong reserves on a long front,       I think in rear of Monastir reserves do exist viz:- 2 French divisions to support the French Army but there does not appear to be&apos; the slightest intention to use them to support any other army.     The question of any hostile attack here is pooh-poohed and I cannot imagine that the subject as a whole has ever been seriously considered except in this army where the arrangements necessary for a retirement have been worked out.
I had an audience today with the King of Greece on the occasion of his. visit.     He is only a nominal King and rather a querulous boy.     It will take a great deal to weld Greece into a nation.,In conclusion you need have no doubts as to the fighting capacity of this army In case of attack.     I have full confidence in It from top to bottom,. and even holding a long line we will take some beating: but we badly want to have a go at the Bosche before the end.(sd)    G,F.Milne.
