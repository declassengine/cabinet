4 \\ STOhARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION :7th - 13th Sept., 1917.1.   Denmark* Since the middle of August there has been a steady   Iincrease in the exports of cattle from Denmark to Germany, although the Germans are paying lower prices than before.Germany has not undertaken to supply any coal to Denmark after December 1st, and it is doubtful whether she will be able to maintain the present rate of deliveries after that date.The German Government have agreed to supply Denmark with 2,000 tons of petroleum in pert compensation for the export of horses.      But this concession will not go far towards relieving the famine of petroleum inDenmark.     We have raised our embargo on the importation!!of petroleum from overseas, but the United States Govern ment are granting no licences for export to Denmark. Three thousand horses a month are being exported from Denmark to Germany.Sweden The deliveries of German coal to Sweden in Augustare estimated at 180,000 tons;     in July they do not . appear to have exceeded 165,000 tons.      Sweden must, therefore, be drawing steadily upon her coal reserves, and cannot afford to risk any further curtailment of the German deliveries.   This is probably the explanation of her obstinate refusal to cease from supplying Germany with iron-ore.
-2034 JSUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION 7th - 1.3th Sept., 1917.il.   Denmark.SwedenSince the middle of August there has been a steady increase In the exports of cattle from Denmark to Germany, although the Germans are paying lower prices than &quot;before.Germany has not undertaken to supply any coal to Denmark after December 1st, and it is doubtful whether she will be ahle to maintain the present rate of deliveries after that date.The German Government have agreed to supply Denmark with 2,000 tons of petroleum in part compensation for the export of horses.      But this concession will not go far towards relieving the famine of petroleum in Denmark.     We have raised our embargo on the importation of petroleum from overseas, but the United States Governj ment are granting no licences for export to Denmark. Three thousand horses a month are being exported from Denmark to Germany.FThe deliveries of German coal to Sweden In August are estimated at 180,000 tons;     in July they do not  . appear to have exceeded 165,000 tons.      Sweden must, therefore, be drawing steadily upon her coal reserves, and cannot afford to risk any further curtailment of the German deliveries.   This is probably the explanation of her ohstinate refusal to cease from supplying Germany with iron-ore.
Confidential returns of Swedish exports in May and July show that Germany and Austria-Hungary are still receiving from Sweden important consignments of wood-pulp ferro-manganese f ferro-chrome, ferro-silicon and tool-steel.The Swedish Government now offer to grant licences for the transit to Hussia of large Quantities of Goeoa, Dried Fruit, Hides and Leather, iiosin, Shellac and Vegetable Oils on condition of being allowed to retain 15$ of each consignment for sale in Sweden.   The offer is noteworthy as indicating certain commodities of which Sweden is particularly in need.On September 11th, the Stockholm rate of exchange on Berlin stood at 40*85 kr.   The par of exchange is 88*88 kr.yv/aff,&apos;. We have asked the United States to licence theexport of ship-building materials to Norway, on the ground that all ships which are built or repaired with these materials will come under the control of the Inter-Allied Chartering Committee, in virtue of the Anglo-Norwegian Shipping ^Agreement.otherlan&amp;s.       We have offered to pay the Dutch Fishing Industry  32,000 monthly for two months on condition that their exports of fish to Germany in that period shall not exceed 1,000 tons a month;    also to pay them thereafter  56,000 a month on condition that exports to Germany are entirely suspended.   This offer has been rejected. Unless the Fishing Associations repent of this decision,
m- 5 -we shall denounce our agreement with them, and   shall call the attention of the United States to their attitude.negotiations for supplies of German coal have &quot;been temporarily suspended.     This is a consequence of our offer to supply 180,000 tons a month of British eoal, on condition that Holland finds tonnage for the Belgian Relief Commission.     The Dutch negotiators have been encouraged to demand better terms from Germany, and the Germans are holding off.     Unfortunately German coal can be delivered in Holland at a much lower price than the British article;   and this consideration will probably turn the scale against our proposal.  Italy. The Italian Government are much alarmed by our re-fusal to incur financial liability for this year&apos;s orange crop.     They complain that, in consequence of last year&apos;s arrangement with us, they have lost the Swiss market;   and they threaten to hold us responsible for the disasters in which the orange-growers will be involved.     They are not grateful for our offer to take liability for the surplus of the lemon-crop, which is relatively a small matter.     They are also aggrieved because France is receiving exceptional indulgence in respect of her exports to the United Kingdom.     Sir Rennell Rodd learns that, all Italian prohibitions of import are likely to be enforced against British goods, which has not hitherto been the ease.I0#   Switzerland. The German-Swiss Economic Agreement was ratifiedon September 6th, but the President of the Swiss Federation
finds some difficulty in establishing the new Bank which is to be responsible for the advances due to Germany under the Agreement.The Swiss Government are prepared to give facilities for raising an Allied loan in Switzerland, hut wish to stipulate for further imports of foodstuffs in compensation for the loan.     We are not willing to give any undertakings, on account of our share in the loan, other than a promise to forbear from taking any action against the&apos; Swiss hanks which have subscribed to the German loan.     But we shall not object if the French Government offer additional facilities for the transit of food to Switzerland;   and we are prepared to let the French take a, larger share than ourselves of the loan.United States, The United States Government are desirous that the shipping agreements which we make with neutral countries should not be so construed as to affect any neutral tonnage which is at present chartered to American citizens. We however feel some apprehension that, if we relinquish our claim to this tonnage, it may be employed in services which only benefit American interests.South America. The French have proposed that the whole surplus of the Argentine cereal crops should be purchased for the account of the Allies.     The British Treaaury approve in principle, but consider that the financial co-operation of the United States is indispensable, and would prefer that the United States should undertake the whole purchase.
