7c(Thm Document Is the* ProDertv of / sSECRET N.S.R.13./no yiO V IRECRUITMENT OP LABOUR FROM SHIPYARDS MEivIORANDU-1 BY THE MINISTER OF NAT ION/L SERVICE.I have just received r. copy of the letter (S.L.S.400 2087) dated 6th September, addressed by the Admiralty to the Secretary of the War Cabinet on the-question of whether men who have.entered Shipyards between the 29th March and the 15th July should receive Scheduled Occupation Certificates or &quot;Bu certificates.I am surprised that tho /dmiralty have made any application direct to the War Cabinet without first submitting the case for tho consideration and recommendation of the Ministry of National Service.   The latter course has been followed by the Army Council, r. copy of whose letter dated 6th September 1917 is attached.I submit that this is exactly the type of dispute arising between Government Departments which the War Cabinet Intend should be submitted to the Ministry of National Service, in order that that Ministry may if possible settle the difference without re-courso to the War Cabinet, or, should such settlement prove impossible, may put forward for the decision of the War Cabinet ws&amp;m such recommendations as seem right after a full investigation of the cr.se.As this course has not been followed by the Admiralty I submit the following recommendations for the consideration of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet have decided (209 Minute 2, G&gt; that the recruitment of labour from Shipyards for the Army should cease so
far as concerns all men in Shipyards before the 15th July as against the 29th March.It is agreed both by the Admiralty and the Army Council that the object of this decision is to protect from recruitment for the time being men engaged in the occupations specified in Code No,0011 of the Schedule of Protected Occupations, who have entered Shipyards between the 29th March and the 15th July.   The Admiralty claim further, however, tha-.. the effect of the War Cabinet decision was to amend the Schedule of Protected Occupations.   The practical effect of this claim is not without importance.    If the Admiralty claim be upheld all men who entered the industry between the specified dates will be entitled to receive Scheduled Occupation Certificates.It is to be noted, however, that any man who held, or was entitled to, a Scheduled Occupation Certificate before moving to shipyard work still holds that Certificate, or is still entitled to claim it, if it has not already been issued to him.   The difference between the Admiralty and the Army Council is therefore substantially confined to the case of unskilled men.I am strongly of opinion that where such men are not already in possession of, or entitled to, Scheduled Occupation Certificates, the certificates to be issued should be, not Scheduled Occupation Certificates, but A.P.W. 3476 B.  The issue of MB&quot; certificates coupled with instructions which, I understand, have already been issued to all Munitions Area Dilution Officers and Munitions Area Recruiting Officers, that such men are not to be released for military service, will afford to such men a complete protection from recruiting until the War Cabinet directs otherwise.   The Protection is complete for the following reason.    Immediately a Protection Certificate is issued, whatever its character, notice is given to &apos; the Area Recruiting Officer that the man in question hold^ a Munitions Area Recruiting Office Certificate, and that he cannot under any circumstances be called up for military service, except on the Order of the Mtoitieuj A-ea Recruiting Officer.   He, in his turn, is precluded from calling these particular men up, because both he and the
2 0 3Dilution Officer have been expressly instructed not to do so.The protection of the men for the purposes which the War Cabinet had in view would, therefore, be no greater if they received Scheduled Occupation Certificates.   On the other hand, there is, in my opinion, grave objection to the issue of such certificates.   These certificates have a quasi permanent character, and should the War Cabinet hereafter decide that it was no longer necessary to afford special protection to the men who have entered Shipyards between the 29th March and the 15th July, it would, either be necessary to allow these men to retain Scheduled Occupation Certificates, to which they would no longer be entitled, or, if the certificates were recalled, to run the risk of creating a general feeling of unrest amongst skilled workers in scheduled occupations, who would fear that their own protection was being jeopardised.    Similar difficulties would arise in the event of any such men moving from Shipyards to other work.   On leaving the shipyard such men would cease to be entitled to protection.   It is most undesirable that unskilled men should move to other work carrying Scheduled Occupation Certificates with them, the possession of which would undoubtedly give rise to demands by other workers in other industries, (who would at most be in possession of nBn certificates), that they should be issued the Scheduled Occupation Certificates.   The alternative would be to withdraw the Scheduled Occupation Certificates immediately the men changed their work, which, as already pointed out, would create a feeling of unrest amongst skilled workers properly holding Scheduled Occupation Certificates.I wish to emphasise most strongly, both the discontent which the issue .of Scheduled Occupation Certificates to unskilled men in
In shipyards would arouse in the minds of men similarly employed in other industries, and the unrest, which would without doubt arise amongst the holders of Scheduled Occupation Certificates generally, when the rumours of withdrawals got about.   Prom constant experience I am convinced that the fact that Scheduled Occupation Certificates were withdrawn, would be the point seized on, and, in nine cases out of ten, the reason for this withdrawal would not be appreciated,In my opinion the balance of probability is that industrial unrest is less likely to be caused if nB&quot; Certificates be issued to the unskilled men affected.    It is agredd that there is no difference in the degree of protection accorded so long as the men remain at work,in the shipyard and the Cabinet decision remains unmodified.(Signed)     A. C. GEDDES.15th Sept. 1917.
6th September, 1917.27/Exempti ohs/3858   D.R.4.Sir,I am commanded by the Army Council to forward for your- consideration a copy of a letter which has been received by the Director of Recruiting from the Shipyard Labour Department of the Admiralty.     I am also to forward a copy of the minute of the War Cabinet (No. 209 of the 9th August, 1917) referred to in the above mentioned letter.The Army Council consider that there is nothing in the minute of the War Cabinet which supports the contention that men entering Shipyards after March 20th are entitled to receive the Protection Certificates f..F.&apos; . 3476 A&lt;     It will be observed that the first paragraph of the minute direots that recruitment or withdrawal of Labour from Shipyards for the Army should cease so far as concerns all men In the Shipyards before the 15th July. Having expressed the result which the War Cabinet have decided to attain, the minute in paragraph 2 deals with the methods by which that result ir  to be attained. Paragraph 2 begins by stating that the Cabinet do not agree at present to making Shipbuilding a fully protected industry, and goes on to direct the Recruiting Department to take administrative action as an emergency measure to furnish the men needed for carrying out the Shipbuilding programme.There are two classes of certificates by which the necessary protection can be given to men engaged in Shipyards before July 15th, 1917.       In the first*place there is A.F.W. 3476 A, which although legally only a Certificate of Protection is in fact regarded by the Industrial classes as being equivalent to exemption and as possessing a more or less permanent nature. Secondly, there is A.F.V. 3476 v, which was expressly devised to afford temporary protection to men who for the time being are regarded as necessary In a particular industry.The Army Council contend that the minute of August 9th was clearly drafted to refer to the second of these two Certificates, and that the language used in paragraph 2 of the minute directly excludes the grant of the fuller Protection of A.F.V&apos;. 3476 A. to unskilled men.The Army Council desire to represent that the contention of the Shipyard Labour Department of the Admiralty should not be upheld for the following, amongst other, reasons.(1)        The grant of A.F.W. 3&apos;76 B, coupled with the prohibition of recruitment contained in paragraph 1 of the minute affords complete protection to the men concerned as Ion;* as the prohibition remains in force.     The grant of the 11B&quot; Certificate is therefore an administrative act which fully satisfies the emergency mentioned in paragraph 2 of the minute.
(2) If the &quot;A&quot; Certificate is granted to these men, numbers of whom are unskilled&gt; it will be very difficult to withdraw such Certificates when the emergency has ceased to exist without causing industrial unrest.This objection does not attach to the grant of &quot;B&quot; Certificates.(3) It is submitted that the point raised in tho last paragraph of the letter of the Shipyard Labour Department cannot be supported.     But for the alteration in date these men would have had no protection at all and would in all probability have been recruited some time since.The grant to them of the &quot;B&quot;. Certificate will in fact protect them until the War Cabinet removes the prohibition contained in paragraph 1 of the minute.     It is submitted that they should not be heard if they attempt to claim a form of protection which the Bar Cabinet might hereafter find it difficult to rescind.(4) It is submitted further that the agreement contained in the^letter of the Shipyard Labour Department that men who enter the Shipyards between March 29th and July 15th should be placed- in the same position as men who were so employed before March 29th is fallacious.     The whole of the Schedule of Protected Occupations (M.M. 130) is based on the fact that the men to be protected were in certain occupations on certain dates.The object which the War Cabinet had in view -&apos;.&apos;hen the Schedule of Protected Occupations was authorised was   to protect the experienced skilled men and to ensure that Dilutees should be .called to the Colours before the skilled men were taken;     This object would be defeated if the contention of the Shipyard Labour Depart..lent on this point were to prevail.I am to point out that in most of the occupations dealt with by the Schedule all men who entered their occupation after the 15th August, 1915, are regarded as Dilutees.   To meet the special requirements of the Admiralty, it was decided that only men who entered occupation in Shipyards after March 29th, 1917, should be regarded as Dilutees.      It is submitted that no further- extension in this direction should be sanctioned.The Army Council are not aware of who are the &quot;higher authorities&apos;&apos;&apos; to whom the Director of Shipyard Labour is submitting the case for decision,     In the opinion of the Army Council the Minister of National Service is the proper authority to decide questions of this description, and I am to request you. to lay this letter before him for his consideration.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd)B.  B. CUBITT.
