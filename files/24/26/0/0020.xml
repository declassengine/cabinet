(a)... My-concentration is almost complete, and I hope about September 16th to move forward from.Narongom.be and ;&apos;: :&apos;y   Mssindyo. .&quot;Ha.nfor.ce&quot;., which had been much depleted by casualties and sickness, has now been reinforced by the 127th Baluchis and. 55th Rifles from India;    and the Nigerian Brigade (less one battalion) and the 25th Indian. Cavalry have also been .brough to this area.        .... (yli) &apos;-&apos;Lindl Area.-,--&apos;.- .&quot;The LIndl Force  (Br .-Gen. &quot;  0&apos;Grady) has also been reinforced,, and. will shortly muster over 3,000 rifles.(B) .-My plan of operations Is as under,-   A rapid forward;.movement -from Narongombe and&apos;Mssindye toY^rards the Mbemkuru.. When the enemy has been driven back to.the Mbemkuru, the direction-of his further retreat for his final concentration in Gorman East Africa,  (i.e.- whether towards Liwale or towards &apos; ..&apos; Massassi) will be disclosed, and I shall shape my plans In . &apos;&quot;.accordance with this. &apos; Should he retreat on Liwale, I can move up the Mbemkuru Valley ...with, the whole of my &apos;J&amp;ilwa Force&apos;.&quot;&apos;      &apos; &apos;. &quot;&apos; = v&apos; Should, he retreat on Massassi, I can&apos;reinforce the- Lindi Force by the Nigerian Brigade. &apos;:&gt;  ;  Owing to the scarcity of water at this.season there are only three practicable routes connecting the Mbemkuru and%Lukeledi      Valleys, viz.,     - &apos;
&apos;a)   Hakiku-Hputy/a-Lutamba Lake .-(b}   NahungOrMts chinyiri-Wyangao, -(o) . Nangano-Ruponda-Luke ledi . - The---&quot;two former are the best as regards water.Simultaneously with the advance from Mssindye and Narongom.be the LIndi Force will engage the enemy near Mtua/.and will push on towards Massassi .The Belgians have agreed to operate as under :~ (a) Firstly, to occupy Mahenge.     Secondly, to move forward to the line Mponda&apos;s - Luwegu River&apos;.   Thirdly, to send as strong a force as possible to the district  (reported to be rich)         -lying Immediately N.&apos;f. of Liwale. &quot;&apos;,-. .Northey will nio-ve&apos;.forward from. Marangandu and Mponda&apos;s towards. Liwale and the district lying S.E. of that place.In all the above operations the enemy&apos;s forces are the main objectives.     &quot;.Whilst recognising the desirability of occupying the fertile districts, and thus depriving the enemy of his sources of supply, I am. convinced that the only means of forcing his surrender in any reasonable time is defeating him in battle.
(E) .-As to the co-operation of the Portuguese, I have made my plansclear to the Portuguese Commander-in-Chief, and have requested him to effect a blockade of the Rovuma River for-40-50 miles on either side of. Ngomano.    I have not as yet received his reply....I have 200 Intelligence Scouts - on the south side of the ..Rovuma, who are doing most useful work in the vicinity of Mocimboada Rovuma, and I am sending you a further communication on this ...subject of co-operation by the Portuguese.
