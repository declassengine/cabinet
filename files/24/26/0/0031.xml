SECRET.WEEKLY REP&apos;ORT ON .RUMANIA. XV.(14September, 1917).The General Situation.During the past fortnight there have been no military eventson the Rumanian front of sufficient importance to modify the situation appreciably;   fighting continues, but as yet the Rumanian army is holding its own admirably.    Preliminary arrangements for the removal of the Government to Kherson have already beenThe Internal Situation.As the Rumanian Parliament has adjourned there is nothing to report as to internal politics.Rumania&apos;s International Relations.In spite of the bitter disappointment felt in Rumania at the Russian military debacle, strenuous efforts are being made to maintain friendly relations with the Russian Government.     The latter is showing all possible good-will towards Rumania and is making every arrangement to offer the best hospitality to the   v-Rumanlan Government in case of its removal to Russian soil. The cordial messages exchanged between King Ferdinand and Mr Kerenski (reported in the British press on September. 3) should do everything possible to revive the confidence   of the disappointed Rumanian troops in Russia&apos;s friendly intentions.   Mr Kerenskifs friendly message was all the more needed as it was well-known in Rumania that the defection of the Russian troops on the Foc^ani sector necessitated the immediate employment of the Rumanian reserves.Si       [made, but Iasi has yet not been evacuated.
The Rumanian press is, as always, full of articles friendly to France.   The recent ceremony in Paris, when the French Government handed over to the Rumanians the old Standard of Stephen the Great of Moldavia found in a monastery on Mt. Athos, was fully reported and gratefully applauded in the Rumanian papers.There is still a regrettable, if natural absence of British news in the Rumanian press.   This seems to be due to lack of material) not to lack of good-will, for Rumanian press references to this country are invariably friendly.     Professor Iorga has announced the publication of a new book called &quot;L&apos;Histoire des relations anglo-roumaines&quot; - a subject which has been hitherto almost untouched.Rumanian Irredenta.In Report No. XIV attention was drawn to the increased regime of oppression inaugurated by Count Apponyi.   Rumanian schools in Hungary are to be nationalised {that is to say Magyarised) &quot;in the interests of the security of the Hungarian State&quot;.     Count Apponyi gave as a reason for this outrageous proceeding the fact that &quot;very many teachers had adopted an unpatriotic attitude&quot; during the Rumanian invasion of Transilvania.   The language of Instruction is to be Magyar.   The Hungarian press is demanding the expropriation of all Rumanian property on the Carpathian frontier in order that this danger-point may in future be entirely in reliable Magyar hands.In Report No. XII some account was given of the new Nationalist Movement in Bessarabia,   in conformity with the resolution adopted at the Conference there.mentioned a &quot;Moldavian&quot; school has been opened in Chisjsinau (Kishinyov).   The leaders of the movement are four well-known Rumanian Bessarabians.   The Rumanians of Bessarabia are taking up a strong pro-war attitude and though they demand
categorically the recognition of Beesarabian autonomy by the Russian Government, they have as yet shown no wish to break with Russia.   They have issued a stirring appeal to the Rumanian population of Bessarabia calling on them to fight the German invader and to suppress treachery and espionage ruthlessly.Some difficulties have arisen between these Bessarabians and the Ukrainian Nationalists.   The latter early in August made the declaration that they considered Bessarabia as within their contemplated Ukrainian State.     This aroused consternation among the Bessarabian leaders and they at once met and protested. As a result of this protest the matter was brought up before the Committee of the Central Ukrainian Rada on August 8, and many speakers pointed out that the Ukrainian demand to include Bessarabia would be an   infringement of the principle of self-determination of peoples.   On the other side it was urged that the inclusion of Bessarabia had the support of the leaders of the Ukrainian movement and the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Tereshchenko. It was finally decided to abandon the idea of including Bessarabia.To the facts given in Report Bo. XI as to the arrival of Transilvanian volunteers for the Rumanian army from Russia it may be added that another batch numbering 100 officers and five to six hundred men has arrived in las I, and, according to the press, they were given an enthusiastic welcome. There have been a great number of naturalisations in Rumania lately of Austro-Hungarian Rumans.Present Propaganda.Apparently only 3 Rumanian papers are now allowed to appear in Austria-Hungary, of course under very strict censorship. They are the Foaia Poporulul Roman (Budapest), Drapelul (Lugoj), and Telegraful Roman (Hermannstadt).
The German press announces the appearance at Bucarest of a new daily called Lumina (&quot;The Light&quot;), edited by Constantin Stere.   Mr Stere is a Bessarabian by origin, was exiled to Siberia by the old Russian Government, and escaped some years ago.      He subsequently became Rector of the University of lasi and a violent Russophobe.   Since the outbreak, of war he has been favouring the German propaganda and recently returned to Bucarest.   The new paper, it is declared, is intended to effect a reconciliation between Rumania and the Central European Powers.   The only other paper in Rumanian now appearing in Bucarest is the Gazeta Bucurestilor, which supplies the Rumanians with.such news as the Central Powers consider good for thdm.     A recent number of it announces the death of loan Procopiu, late editor of LTIndependence Roumaine, and a great friend of Mr Bratianu, who recently defended him hotly in the Rumanian Parliament .for having remained behind in Bucardst.A new weekly paper, Romania Mare (&quot;Great Rumania&quot;), has begun to appear in Kiyev.    Its chief object is to voice the ideas of Rumanian irredentists from Austria-Hungary;   prominent Transilvanians like Octavian Goga are directing it.   The Rumanians are now doing something to explain their cause to the nations of Western Europe.   Three or four numbers of a paper called Romanul have now appeared in Paris, mainly in French and partly in Rumanian.     It is edited by the Rumanian journalists Dichter and Pavalescu.    Next month this is to be supplemented by a more ambitious monthly Revue de Roumanie, which has the patronage of the Rumanian Government.   Steps are ftlso being taken to inaugurate a propaganda in Switzerland which, if it Is as ably organised as that of the Serbian Bureau at Geneva, may do something to counteract the feverish efforts of Bulgarian agents.
Rconomic Conditions.Conditions in Rumania are extremely bad.   Owing to inadequate railway communication with Russia and the over-crowding by refugees of Iasi and other Moldavian towns, there is a deplorable scarcity of food.   For instance, the Minister of Food Supplies, Mr Constantinescu v;as lately able to announce as &quot;joyful news&quot; that in future the population would be allowed to eat meat once a week.   The fuel problem is also serious, but the papers now give more reassuring news of the supply and distribution of wood among the population.14.9.17. AWAL.
