(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PRQi^TY OF HIS. BRITANKIC  AJESTY-&apos;S GQVj^Iii^HT)fesCRET.. WAR CABINET. FIX&apos;AKClAL SITUATION IN CANADA.Memorandum&apos; by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,I have just read the. telegram from. Lord .ftorthcliffe conveying the results of his conversationwith Sir Robert Borden. I have also had an interview with j:.ir George Perley, who - told me he had seen the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and is writing to the Prime minister.     I think it my duty to state very briefly that it is impossible to exaggerate the importance of finding some way out&apos;of the present dangerous situation.   It is not my business to deal with the finance side of the question, but I am compelled to warn the Cabinet that if matters remain as they are, the result will be to throw Canada into the arms of the United States.;     There has been for years a party In Canada who openly advocated alliance with the United, States of America,.and, if now, in addition to the ordinary burdens of the war, Canada is faced with a financial collapse, and forced to make such terms as she can with the United States of America, it will destroy all the work of the Imperialists of Canada, of many years, will give the party of Separation a very powerful cry, and, I believe, will most certainly be the last straw that will break the back of the Borden Government.     Sir George Perley urged upon me that pressure should be brought to bear upon the United States of America to deal liberally with us in this matter.   I do not venture to make suggestions, but I am anxious that the real gravity of the situation from the Imperial point of view shall be present to the Cabinet. &quot;(Intld.) T,v.I-I.L,13th September 1917.

Borden had a long conversation with me and urged necessity of sending to Washington a Canadian representative.   White also laid emphasis on this having/v&apos;iew of increasing complication of Anglo Canadian American finance.     I pointed out that I was only on a private visit to-Governor General.They put forward the name of Sir Edmund Walker, President of Canadian Bank of Commerce.They added that they would be glad if I would inform Loi&apos;d Reading at once on his arrival of pressing natare of the situa-tion which is urgent In vie?/ of open discussion-now taking place in Canadian Parliament about the approaching Canadian financial crisis.I have received following in a. letter from&apos;..White.. Question of maintaining Canada&apos;s export&apos;trade with Great Britain is nnt only of economic but also of Imperial Importance.   It is essential that Canada obtain funds from the United States Government for purchase of essential Canadian food stuffs so that trade in these commodities built/Tay unremitting effort for so many, years shall not be diverted to the United States with the probability of .far reaching consequences.Borden asserted that stoppage of labour would mean lack of employment and would be fatal to his Government.White again stated that British Government apparently id not.appreciate political situation in Canada and seemed&apos;.to imagine &apos;i&amp;t matter was of concern only to British and Canadian Treasury apartments.
