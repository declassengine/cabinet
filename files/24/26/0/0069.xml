^\ Cflftte^i^ll^^ PORTUGUESE TO MAKE BOW USB  )CyCW        0F jgjj rj^oop      SPORTS PLACKD AT THEIR DISPOSAL.Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinal ,Bv to Cabinet 162, Hinuto 6, the Fi*st Sea Lord wasrecmesto.i &quot;to arrange for two British Transports to convey fie remainder of the Portuguese Division to Brest and to detail two Destroyers as escort, and the Foreign Office was requested to inform the Portuguose Government that ihese ships were loaned on tho distinct condition that their passenrjer and cargo s?ace was fully utilised.  &apos;I4**  Transports, the &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Inventor&quot; were accordingly allocated to this service, and their subsequent history is as followsVoyage early August,   Both ships sailed to programme hut carried 1,087 men less than their complement. .Voyage latter part of August.   Both Ships sailed to programme and were completely filled.Voyage early September.   Slips were to have sailed on the 6th September, but embarkation was postponed, ihe reason given by the War Minister being the urgency for shipping a large quantity of wine which was not ready and that a       more days were required for organisation of the reinforcements.    Ultimately on the 11th September it was found that -the &quot;Inventor&quot; could    not be completely filled (owing to riots in Lisbon), but the War Minister wished her to sail on account of her valuable cargo of wine and the fact that she had essential uniform equipment for artillery troops awaiting it at Havre.The &quot;Bellerophon&quot; has accordingly been out of Service tils month up to the present, but should leave for Brest in the latter part of the month.   It is proposed that the &quot;Inventor&quot; should return to Lisbon to embark wood cutters for conveyance to England.-   -   .    ota vessels are valuable cargo carriers having a total deadweight capacity of SS^O tons.   Neither of them are being adequately employed,    Juciging by the difficulty the Portuguese have in finding troops to complete their toeaitionary Force it would seem probable that their monthly reinforcements can    &apos;&apos; bn dealt with in two of their own Transports which are available.The approval of the War Cabinet is desired to bo til vessels being removed from the Portuguese service after their next voyage from Portugal. to18th September, 1917.
