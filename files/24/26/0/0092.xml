Victoria 8240.BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.359To avoid delay, address all communications to :  ^r^Tr5T*k&gt;DiRECTOR General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)19th September, 1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of theFood Production Department for the week ended the 18th September:-the week:-Berkshire. The Executive Committee have requested Mr.Cole of West Woodhay to cultivate certain portions of that estate which were recommended for cultivation in a report made by a representative of the Department, and to exterminate the rabbits on those&apos; portions of the estate which have hitherto been largely used as a rabbit warren.Essex.   As a result of a conference with representatives of the Committee and of the agents for the Ecclesiastical Commissioners who own the property, the latter have been authorised to determine the tenancy of a farm of 800 acres at Weald Hall near Epping, the arable portion of which the tenant has not been found competent to cultivate.     The Order is made on the understanding that the tenant shall be allowed to remain in his present residence and shall be offered a tenancy of 180 acres (with the buildings thereon) now forming part of the farm.Kent. The Cemmittee have been authorised to take possession of and to cultivate 65 acres of land near Dover (Including 25 acres ofLOCAL ORGANISATION.Work of the Agricultural Executive Committees.The following matters have been reported upon during-1-
park) which the owner, Major Lawes, had offered for cultivation *  but was unable to cultivate himself. Lancashire.   A farmor near Chorley has beon fined  20 and  5.5s. costs for failing to comply with a notice, given in March last and repeated a month later, to cultivate a piece of land, manure it and plant it with potatoes.     At the Petty Sessions the defendant gave an undertaking that he would in future cultivate the land as far as possible in accordance with the requirements&apos;of the Committee; but the Bench considered that his negligence was to a certain extent wilful, and said that they would have imposed a heavier penalty had the defendant been a younger man. Somerset.   The Committee have been authorised to prosecute Mrs. Bonhara Christie of Marston Bigot near Prome for non-compliance with a notice to cultivate a kitchen garden 4 or 5 acres in extent, reported to be in a deplorably foul state.     The notice was served on 30th July, 1917, to clean the land before 31st August;   the labour of two soldiers was obtained for Mrs.Christie but they wore employed only on weeding the asphalt paths and practically no cleaning of the land was done before the date mentioned. Sussex, West.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a farm of 195 acres near Ashington owned and occupied by a woman of 82, who is stated to be incapable of making any effort to increase the food production of the farm. Flintshire.   The Committee have had under consideration tho peculiar circumstances of the detached Hundred of Maelor where the land is used largely for cheese production;   they have decided to aPPly generally to the Hundred the principles on which the land to be ploughed up have been allocated to the rest of the county, subject to any necessary modifications of detail in particular cases.     They have also given notice to the Chester Golf Club to plough up 74 acres of their land at Soaland for corn. Monmouthshire.   The Committee have requested Sir Clifford Cory to improve the cultivation of land owned by him at Llantarnan Abbey.
ei 0 iDrainage.The East Suffolk Committee are taking action under the Drainage of Lands Order for the cleansing of the Rivers Deben and Pynn in the Vipodbridge District.Determination of Tenancies* During the week 7 Orders have-been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 200 acres, and an Order has been made by the Board determining one tenancy.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No. 2).Reports from 1,074 districts shov; that 195,576 persons made application under the Order, of whom 176,943 have been supplied with plots containing in the aggregate an area of 13,092 acres.The above figures include returns from 12 RuTal Districts or Parishes) to the Councils of which the Board delegated pov/ers under Regulation 2L.     584 plots, containing a total area of 46 acres, were thus provided, but it should be observed that three of these districts, vdiich provided a total of 476 plots for temporary cultivation under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, provided in addition no fewer than 5,143 ne-v plots for permanent allotments.     Moreover, one district reports that the possession of compulsory powers enabled the Council to come to terms with a landowner with whom they had not previously been able to arrange.HORTICULTURAL SECTION. Potato Spraying. - Negotiations are being commenced with a view to ascertaining whether the distribution of machines and chemicals for spraying can next year be entirely undertaken by the trade j   the manufacturers have promised to do everything possible to-assist the Department.     The remaining 18 tons of
unpacked Copper Sulphate has ncm.TseerL^ld.vegetable bottling&apos;have been given?during the week in 2X-couiities,the number of demonstrators being 27.Three additional Fruit Pulping Stations were opened  n the17th, viz. at the National Fruit and Cider Institute, Long Asliton,gwhere plums grown at Frampton Cot^rell are being handled;   and at Newport, Salop, and at Bewdley, where the stations will mainly deal with the damson crop.     The total amount of fruit now being handled is 1,100 to 1,200 tons per week.The following statement shows the progress already made in establishing stations for vegetable drying in the counties.of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, where the work is being organised mainly from the S.E. Agricultural College at Wye, under Dr. V. Eyre.     In other parts of the country the arrangements for starting stations are not so far forward, and they will be reported on later.After exhaustive investigation into the possibilities of drying vegetables in hop oasts, it has been found that premises fitted with power driven fans of such types as the Sirocco and Shew, can be easily adapted for this purpose, and that with one or two exceptions it is not anticipated that the costs of the necessary adaptation will involve much more than the installation of the drying plants and machinery.In accordance with the scheme, Wye has been made a training centre for forewomen, and at present six women are resident in the College for this purpose.     The course of instruction in drying will generally last about three weeks, after which every suitable candidate will spend a week in the central office at Wye for Instruc-tion In the method to be followed in keeping the books and records.At least three of the trained forewomen will be required at each drying centre, of which it is intended to establish
13 or 14 in the districts of Kent and Surrey.The following stations have been selected in this area;-WYE. The alterations are now practically complete.

The difficulty, however, is to find buildings to which the Military Authorities do not lay claim. Blackberries.      At the instance of the War Office, the Department have entered into an undertaking with the Controlled Jam Firms for the supply of a minimum quantity of 1,000 .tons of Blackberries.     An organisation for this purpose has been started in the counties of Oxford, Bucks, Beds, North Hants, Warwick, and Gloucester.    One of the principal dealer^ in blackberries, who last year supplied the Army factories with trade quantities, has undertaken the organisation of the collection and railing of the fruit to the Government Jam factories.The Board of Education have authorised the Local Education Authorities in the counties named above, to allow the children in the Elementary Schools two half holidays a week for the purpose of picking blackberries, and the Secretaries of the Local Education Authorities and the Teachers in the greater number of the 1,572 schools in the counties indicated, have taken up the scheme enthusiastically, and the first supplies have already reached the Controlled Houses.
3p r 0 3Distribution of Sugar.   Of the 2,500 tons of sugar which were put at the disposal of this Department for distribution amongst fruit growers for  am making, orders for 2,310 tons have been received and transferred to Wholesale Agents for despatch.TECHNICAL DIVISION. There is nothing to report this week.LABOUR.Soldier Labour.   The weekly returns shew that 1,130 skilled men supplied for the 1918 programme were sent out to farmers during last week, making a total of 5,620 such men sent out to date. The number of unskilled men who went out during the week was 497, including men made available for harvest work.     There is still a shortage of skilled ploughmen at many of the Distribution Centres.In connection with the training scheme, the centre at Brentwood where men are to be instructed in both motor tractor work and horse ploughing was opened during the week.     In addition, a fresh fcatch of men have been sent for training to the Tractor School at Woldingham.     Land has been inspected at other places with a view to the establishment of further training centres, and reports received from Committees shew that many of these have already commenced, or are about to commence, training men for horse ploughing.During the week 92 men have been supplied for training as tractor drivers, making 384 such men supplied to date.     In addition, arrangements have been made for the supply of 83 men for work in connection with steam ploughing tackle, a few of the men being skilled, the remainder requiring training.A letter has been addressed to all owners of threshing tackle informing them that men can now be supplied for training as engine drivers or feeders.     All threshing tackle owners have also been recommended to engage some unskilled soldiers as a travelling gang to travel with the machine.
Horses.   Orders for the issue of 308 additional horses have been sent to Remount Depots, making a total of 1,477 horses up to date. Prisoners of War. One new scheme for the employment of prisoners of war has been sent to the War Office during the week, and in the case of one of the existing schemes additional prisoners have been asked for.     In all, 4,519 prisoners are now being employed in agricultural work.Women&apos;s Branch.There Is a slight Increase In the number of women accounted for this week, the total now being 6,475 as against 6,450 mentioned In last week&apos;s Report.This week has brought sudden demands for potato pickers, which, owing to the number already lent to the Forage and Forestry Departments, there has been great difficulty in satisfying.   As the potato pickers will be wanted only for a few weeks it has not been considered advisable to recall any of the women lent to   other Departments, and it is hoped to meet the demand by a more general enlistment of local labour.A large number of requests having been received for more highly skilled women workers, a Course of training has.been arranged at the South Eastern College, Wye.     Fifteen women will be admitted to the course, which will extend over a period of about twenty-twp weeks.     Tuition will be given in practical and theoretical farming.    The women who take this course will be expected next season to take posts as Forewomen, Under-Baliffs or Instructresses.    Numerous applications are being received.MACHINERY AND IMPLEMENTS. Motor Tractors.   A further 40 tractors have been consigned during the week to Agricultural Executive Committees in England and Wales, and there are in addition 98 tractors on offer to counties and 97 available for allocation as soon as they have been assembled. The total number of tractors received by the Department is now 1,571 which includes 92 sent to Scotland and 14 sent to Ireland.
SUPPLIES.In view of the large demand for Fertilisers cf all kinds a Press Notice has been issued urging that fertilisers shall be used for food crops only, and not in the cultivation of flowers. Sulphate of Ammonia.    The arrangement whereby Sulphate of Ammonia was sold at a lower price during June to September.has now come to an end, as all orders at the reduced price had to be placed before the 15th inst.,   The attitude of merchants towards the recommendations of this Department in regard to storage has changed very much since the beginning of the period.     At first complaints were made that the reduction in price was insufficient to cover the expense of storage, but these complaints evidently had little foundation as it has been difficult to satisfy the demands of those anxious to take advantage of the reduced price. Nitrate of Soda.   At the request of the Foreign Office, arrangements ha%  been made to purchase a cargo of 2,700 tons of titrate of Soda now lying at Falmouth.     This cargo will be sold to farmers through Approved Agents,Potash.   An arrangement has been made with the Ministry of Munitions whereby Flue Dust containing Potash will only be sold for direct application to the soil, and not to Compound Manure Mixers.     The applications for licences to purchase will be submitted to this Department for approval in order to ensure that this is the case.Lime.      Negotiations are now nearly concluded with a firm in Devonshire for the erection, at the expense of the Department, of a plant to grind Limestone.    A similar plant which is being erected at Croydon Is nearing completion.    Negotiations are also in progress with several firms for the installation, at their own expense, of plants for drying waste lime, which is produced in a wet state from Soap and other Works.     Plans of suitable drying kiln are being supplied by the Department,
Stable Manure.      Enquiries have been made as to the possibility of utilising a large dump of stable manure near Aldershot, estimated to contain about 100,000 tons.     The only practicable method of moving this large quantity is by the Basingstoke Canal;   this Canal, however, requires repairs at a cost of  4,000 to  6,000.     The War Office contemplated undertaking this work in order to enable the Canal to be used for Military purposes^ but were deterred by the outlay involved.   It is believed that If this Department would guarantee part of the cost of repairing the Canal, the Far Office would reconsider the matter, and a proposal that this Department should purchase the manure for, say,  3000, and undertake its distribution by barge, is now being sent to the War Office.     The money received by the sale of the manure might not be sufficient to cover the whole of the expenses involved in distribution, but it seems that any small loss involved would be fully justified by the benefits obtained by getting the manure on to the land. Wire Netting.      Certain manufacturers have agreed to hold at the disposal of the Department a limited quantity of wire netting for sheep.     Arrangements are being made for this to be sold through the Approved Agents.     This netting is only sold for the protection of growing food crops, and an undertaking to this effect is obtained from the purchaser In each case. Seed Testing Station.   An application is being made to the Treasury for sanction for the small amount of expenditure necessary to equip an official Seed Testing Station to be set up In connection with the Department.    Provisional arrangements are being made for securing the necessary staff and apparatus, and a definite scheme for a limited measure of seed control Is under consideration.Seed Wheat.     The Cereal Advisory Committee has met during the week, and it was decided that the balance of seed of the 1916 crop still remaining in the Department&apos;s hands and amounting-10-
to over 4,000 quarters should be retained until the 1st November.     The Committee recommended that seed wheat of the 1917 crop showing more than bf of sprouted seed should be rejected.This will probably lead to a further reduction of the supply, but it is absolutely necessary to introduce this regulation if a high standard is to be maintained.Seeds other than Cereals.      Arrangements have now been made between the Department and the Ministry of Shipping Control whereby a represantative of the latter Department at various foreign ports will secure tonnage for seeds destined for the United Kingdom when duly advised of their despatch by the consignors, and of the probable date of their arrival at the port.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon, Rowland E. Prothero, M.P. President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
