i;i-TI&lt;|ES f&gt;F   THE WAR CABiNET,y&quot; ITEHALL  GARDENS, S.W.G.T. 2061,   ** ith the Secretary&apos;s Compliments. FOR RECORD.This Memorandum was dealt with by the War Cabinet on 14,9.17.(See War Cabinet 233, :inute 11,)20.9.1917.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.    September 1917.CONFIDENTIAL. G.T. 2061.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a Memorandum on the future government of Egypt, drawn up at my request by Lord Edward Cecil together with two Minutes by Lord Hardinge and Sir R. Graham. While expressing my strong sense that the present position is not satisfactory and may easily lead to Parliamentary and other difficulties, I recognise that it would be unfair to expect the War Cabinet to give the necessary time for the adequate discussion of this very difficult question. I venture, therefore, to suggest that it may be referred either to the existing Mesopotamia Committee or some other Committee specially constituted for the purpose.R. C.MEMORANDUM BY LORD EDWARD CECIL RESPECTING THE FUTUREGOVERNMENT OF EGYPT.THE establishment of a British Protectorate over Egypt has naturally led to the review of the actual system of control exercised by the British Government over the British officials in Egypt, and through them over the administration of Egypt itself. For a long time it has been obvious that the control was defective and inadequate. Such as it is, it has grown up without plan or regular form. In fact, the question has never been seriously taken up.The reason of this is simple enough. During the early part of the occupation the situation was regarded as essentially a temporary one, and therefore beyond stopping scandalous abuses British interference in internal administration was restricted to a minimum. The questions of importance were those connected with foreign influence and aggression rather than domestic matters. As time went, on and it became apparent that Great Britain could not withdraw from Egypt, British intervention in local affairs increased. Meanwhile Lord Cromer had gained the fullest confidence, not only of the Foreign Office and the Government, but also of the British nation at large. Less and less was it felt advisable, less and less, indeed, was it possible, to interfere with his conduct of Egyptian affairs.Though during Sir Eldon Gorst&apos;s short tenure of office there was probably more control from London than there had been before, with the arrival of Lord Kitchener the Consul-General became again, to a great extent, independent.Thus up to the outbreak of war Egypt had, except in matters of first-class importance or those touching her foreign relations, been controlled by the Consul-General without the intervention of the Home Government.Moreover, had it been desired in London to take a greater part in the management of the internal affairs of Egypt it would have been difficult to do so, as there was no one in the British service with sufficient local knowledge to deal with the questions.As now Great Britain has by assuming a formal protectorate over Egypt made herself, at all events indirectly, responsible for the internal government of that country, and as it will be impossible in the future always to obtain men of the qualities and experience of Lord Cromer and Lord Kitchener to fill the position of High Commissioner, it is clear that an effective and adequate system of control of Egyptian affairs by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government should be instituted and the necessary machinery set up.If this is admitted, the first point to be considered is to what Ministry the care of Egyptian affairs should be committed.
Up to the present the Foreign Office has dealt with Egypt.This was obviously right when the principal questions arising with regard to Egypt were of a diplomatic nature and when Egypt was a foreign State under the suzerainty of the Turkish Empire. Now that Egypt is a British Protectorate and Great Britain has become formally responsible for her internal policy and administration, it would seem that some other authority is needed to deal with EgyptianThe Foreign Office has nothing to do with administration, and naturally cannot deal efficiently with such matters.It is rumoured that it is intended to group the Near Eastern British interests under a new administration, but whether this is the case or not, it is clear that this question cannot be fully decided till the conclusion of hostilities. As the control of Egyptian affairs is intimately bound up with other Near Eastern problems, the ultimate decision as to its head must also remain undecided for the present.It is not possible to solve this difficulty by deferring the institution of control over Egypt till the end of the war. The crucial time when the control, advice, and assistance of the Home Government will be most needed will arise directly hostilities cease. The administration of Egypt must then be altered to fit her new conditions. Many anomalies in her government which were forced upon her by her international position will be swept away. Demands for the extension of general or local self-government will be pressed on the British authorities. Many decisions which will vitally affect her future must be taken, and taken rapidly, if the evils of agitation and even unrest are to be avoided. It is all-important that by that period the control of Great Britain over the political organisation and administration of Egypt should be working smoothly and effectively.If, then, it is essential to proceed with this matter at once, it is suggested that, for convenience, Egypt should remain under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs until other Near Eastern questions are settled.It has been said already that the Foreign Office cannot cope satisfactorily with questions of internal policy and administration. If Egypt is to be temporarily left under the Foreign Secretary, it is necessary to form a special Department which is capable of dealing with such matters. Though for convenience this new Department must be for the time being under the Foreign Secretary, this should be frankly recognised as a temporary measure and the Department be so constituted that it can be at any time detached and placed in the charge of any other Minister without inconvenience.The Department must be capable of advising the Secretary of State on all matters connected with Egypt, and must act as the channel between him and the-Egyptian Government, but it will in no sense form a portion of the regular Foreign Office. It is even advisable to keep the offices of the tVvro bodies entirely separate. The management of the foreign relations of Egypt will naturally continue to forma part of the ordinary business of the Foreign Office.In addition to the duties of the Department towards the Secretary of State, it will act the representative of the Egyptian Government in England, obtaining all information required by that body, carrying on negotiations on industrial, legal, financial, and other matters, and deal with all questions of British personnel! appointments, leave, &amp;c.In this connection it must be remembered that the amount of Egyptian business now transacted by the Foreign Office will only form a small portion of that which will pass through the hands of the new office.It is almost certain that in future Parliament will take a deeper interest in Egyptian affairs, and it will be no longer possible for the British Government to hold, as in the past, that the responsibility for Egyptian administration rests principally on the shoulders of the Egyptian Government.Sir A. Webb transacts a certain amount of business for the Egyptian Government, principally that connected with the Egyptian railways and War Office, and there are several other agents of a less official character. It has also been customary m Egypt for years past to deal direct with many of those in Great Britain who have business with the Egyptian Government, though the lack of competent representatives m London has been often very inconvenient. Naturally the Foreign Office could not be employed on such matters, and practically it was only used for business which involved communication by cypher. All this work will be dealt with by the new Department. Such a general agency has been long wanted, and the question was raised as long ago as 1902, but for political reasons the matter has always been deterred.
The Egyptian Educational Mission in Great Britain would also be absorbed in the Department.oi over-s--------    _for beginning with as small a staff as possible is that, as m ail new Departments, it is impossible to predict in what directions it will grow until some experience has beengained. . ^   ,The Chief of the Department, representing, as he will, a country more importantin political position, population, and wealth than some of the small independent States of Europe, must have direct access to the Secretary of State. It will be better if he is not called by a title which will give rise to any confusion as to his position. As he and his Department are only placed under the Foreign Secretary as a temporary measure, any title must be avoided which implies that he is an integral part of the Foreign Office.It is suggested that he should be called simply the Director of the Egyptian Department, though in pay and position he should rank at least with Under-Secretaries.As he may at a later period be charged with more extended functions in regard to the Near East, he should be selected from amongst those who have had long administrative experience in Eastern countries and who have filled high positions, if possible, in more than one of them. For the reasons given above, it is important that he should not be selected from amongst the Foreign Office officials.The Department to start with might be divided into three sections. The first to be called the Political. This would deal with those matters dealt with by the Arab Bureau in Cairo and with the internal political affairs of Egypt.The second section, to be called the Administrative Section, would deal with questions concerning the administration of Egypt, legislation, finance, internal government, irrigation, legal matters, education (including the Educational Mission), public health, agriculture, &amp;c, &amp;c.The third section, to be termed the Agency Section, would carry out all business matters on behalf of the Egyptian Government, purchases, contracts, &amp;c.A legal adviser, if possible with Egyptian experience, should be retained to assist the Department when required.At first one official for each of the first two sections might be appointed, whilst for the present Sir A. Webb&apos;s staff could carry on the duties of the third. As the work develops and increases the staff must be added to where the need is felt.In regard to the personnel, when an increase becomes necessary the principle which should be adhered to, as far as possible, is that the staff should be a judicious mixture of officials drawn from the British Civil Service, who understand the government of this country, and Anglo-Egyptian officials who will supply the personal and accurate knowledge of Egypt which will be required. These latter, and it is a point to which importance is attached, will only serve in the Department for a limited period, say two years. When this time expires they will revert to the Egyptian Service and their places will be taken by others. In this way the specialist knowledge at the disposal of the British Government will be kept up to date and the officials sent back will have a broader view of questions than they would have had had they remained in Egypt. This system will also tend to lessen any friction which may arise between the Department and the Civil Service in Egypt.I would urge that if it is intended to give effect to this or any similar project it is essential that the matter should be taken up at once.Minutes.Lord Hardinge,I submit herewith my observations on Lord E. Cecil&apos;s note regarding the future administration of Egypt. . In view of the fact that a variety of questions affecting Egypt have recently been raised, it is desirable that the Foreign Office should be afforded the fullest information, with regard to the present situation in that country ( from all authoritative sources. Apart from Lord .E. Cecil and myself, who have had opportunities of expressing our views, there are now in London the Advisers
to the Egyptian Ministries of Public Works and Education, also Sir M. Cheetham and Mr. Storrs, and I would strongly urge that they should be given an opportunity of expressing their opinion.R, G.September 2, 1917.Future Administration of Egypt.The progress of Egypt during the last 30 years, from a condition of bankruptcy and anarchy, to one of stable government and great economic prosperity, forms the most striking instance of the success of British methods of administration. This success, achieved under the Foreign Office in the face of unexampled difficulties, has not been equalled in any of our other Colonies and Dependencies. It is due in large measure to the wise policy adopted of trusting to the men on the spot and of affording them a whole-hearted support. Lord E. Cecil refers to the only departure from this rule, when an attempt was made to dictate a policy from London during the early days of Sir E. Gorst&apos;s regime, but this period was by no means the brightest page in the history of our administration of the country.At the present time Egypt is administered under a mixture of ordinary and military law by Sir R. Wingate in concert with the G.O.C. I am in full agreement with Lord E. Cecil, that at the end of the war the system of Home Control over the Government of Egypt must necessarily be regularised, although I hope that it will not be unduly extended. Full Official Reports must be received at the Foreign Office in regard to the situation in and administration of the country, instead of the voluminous private letters with which Sir W. Wingate now keeps us informed. It should be remembered that the very detailed annual reports from the Residency have only been discontinued since the beginning of the war.If eventually we have to undertake the administration of Mesopotamia, that country, Egypt and Aden should be administered by a special department of the Foreign Office. But as regards Mesopotamia, it has been decided that the military situation does not justify an attempt to place the civil administration of the country on a more regular footing, nor even the dispatch of the proposed mission to study the local situation, and the country remains for the present under purely military control. In Egypt we are following the policy of giving Sir R. Wingate full support and as free a hand as possible. I trust that this policy will be maintained until the end of the war, and that no attempt will be made to hamper him or to add to his difficulties by increased interference or control from London.Lord E. Cecil urges that, leaving Mesopotamia aside, a Department should be E-et up at once for Egypt with Political, Administrative and Agency sections. This proposal may appear attractive in theory, but I do not think it would be justified in practice. At present the Ordinary routine work in the Foreign Office connected with Egypt cannot take up more than a few hours a week. Unless we call on Egypt for reports on Political and Administrative questions and attempt to re-organise the Egyptian administration from London, I cannot see how the Political and Administrative sections could justify their existence. Lord R. Cecil in a recent minute remarked that a reference in a memorandum of mine to the need of reforms in the Ministries of Finance and Interior indicated that increased control from London was required. I would respectfully point out that all such reforms must originate in Egypt if they are to be successful. When proposals for such reforms are received from Egypt, they can be considered here, if necessary, by a competent committee. But the Egyptian authorities have their hands full at present with the new Judicature Law, which is being considered, as the reports from Cairo come in, by&apos;a special legal committee already appointed, and in Mr. Hurst we already possess a most competent legal advisor with special knowledge of Egyptian problems. As regards the Agency section. Sir A. Webb&apos;s office deals with Egyptian Government contracts for railway material, coal, stores, &amp;c. I should like to know whether Sir R. Wingate and the Egyptian Government as a whole consider that there is any- i thing to be pained by bringing this Office or the Educational Mission under the new special department in London.   I greatly doubt it!  
Lord E. Cecil&apos;s present proposals involve the entire elimination of the Foreign Office from administration of Egypt, which is to be undertaken by a separate Department only nominally attached to this Office, and under an independent chief having direct access to the Secretary of State. They represent the feeling of personal dissatisfaction with the Foreign Office which has always animated and has been freely expressed by Lord E. Cecil, and which was, to a certain extent, shared by the late High Commissioner. They do not represent the feeling of the native elements who cherish the connection with the Foreign Office, nor of the present High Commissioner, nor of the other branches of the Egyptian Government, which appreciate and are perfectly satisfied with the Foreign Office administration. Sir M. MacDonald, Mr. Dunlop, and the late Judicial Adviser (who are now in London) would bear me out in this.While agreeing with Lord E. Cecil that a new Department should be formed in the Foreign Office to control Egypt at the end of the war, I disagree altogether with his recommendation that this Department should be only nominally attached to the Foreign Office, and that its chief should be independent of the Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs.Lord E. Cecil presupposes that at the end of the war international problems in regard to Egypt will cease, and that it will be possible for the new special department to settle down to the purely internal administration of the counry. I do not believe that this forecast is in accordance with the true facts of the case. Egypt always has been, and will remain a cosmopolitan country, in which questions of foreign subjects and interests will be constantly to the fore. Great stress was laid on this feature by Lord Cromer in his book and in his annual reports, and it accounts for his and Sir W. Brunyate&apos;s idea that the legislative body in Egypt should be internationalised. It will be remembered that the High Commissioner is also Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will he, in this capacity, be under the Foreign Office, or the head of the new separate department, or is it proposed that he should be under the former for Foreign Affairs, and the latter for Administration? The frontiers of Egypt with Tripoli and Abyssinia, and the control from Cairo of the Eedjaz and the Arabian coasts will give rise to constant questions of foreign relations. The abolition of the capitulations, and of the Caisse de la Dette, and the acceptance b}^ the Powers of the new Judicature Law, &amp;o, will have to be negotiated by the Foreign Office, and will engage diplomacy for years to come. The treatment of French commercial interests in Egypt should depend on the treatment of British commercial interests in Morocco, and this entails supervision by the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office. Last but not least, what will be Turkey&apos;s relations with Egypt in the future? Instead of the old Turkish High Commissioner, there will presumably be a Consul-General in Cairo.i And the full support of the Foreign Office will be required to prevent his Consulate from becoming a centre of nationalist and Pan-Islamic agitation. In former days the German Agency was also a centre of anti-British propaganda and intrigue. Will not this continue with a German Consulate ? Certainly for many years to come E^ypt with its mixed population and interests, and its political importance, must remain a field for diplomatic struggles and problems.To sum up, I submit that if Mesopotamia falls to our administration, there will be full scope for the establishment of a Near Eastern Department for Mesopotamia, Egypt and Aden, under a Head of Department, or even under an Under-Secretary. This department should be recruited, partly from the Foreign Office and partly from the Egyptian and Mesopotamian or other administrative services. If Mesopotamia remains in Turkish hands and we are solely concerned with the government of Egypt and Aden, a considerably smaller department will be required, but it should be recruited in the same manner. In either case the department should form part of the Foreign Office and its Under-Seretary, or Head of Department, should be under the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. If and when it becomes evident that Ave must administer Mesopotamia, the department should be constituted at one. If Egypt alone is concerned, preparations should be made for constituting a department at the end of the war, but its actual establishment might well wait until then, the control remaining as at present. There is already an official in the War Department who deals with Egypt, but it would be advisable-to entrust this duty to a more senior man. From enquiries I have made, there does not appear to be anyone on the Foreign Office stall at present,, who would
be available to give up his whole time to Egyptian affairs. Lord E. Cecil&apos;s strictures regarding the administrative incompetence of &apos;the Foreign Office point to an immediate change, but I may be permitted to observe that at the present moment, and probably until the end of the war, there will be a Permanent Under-Secretary, who has been Viceroy of India, and an Assistant Under-Secretary with 10 years&apos; experience of Egyptian administration, both in normal times and, as it is at present, under military law, during which latter period he represented the G.O.C. with the native administration.As regards the future Head of the new Near Eastern or Egyptian Department, I believe that it will be found necessary that he should have some knowledge of foreign politics: further, as Egyptian and Arab notables, few of whom speak English,&apos;will expect to be received by him when they visit London, it is desirable that he should possess a good colloquial knowledge of French and, if possible, of theArabic language also.&quot; R. G.September 2, 1917.The whole ca.se of Lord E. Cecil&apos;s memorandum is, as he himself admits, dependent upon whether the need of a more effective control of Egyptian affairs is accepted or not.The combination of Foreign Office control of policy with a free hand for local recommendation of measures is the system under which Egypt has been gradually brought into the British Empire and has reached its present flourishing condition. That system has, up to date, been approved by Anglo-Egyptian opinion. The question now raised is one of such far-reaching importance that the dictum of Lord E. Cecil alone is not sufficient to carry conviction, and before any decision is taken the opinions of those responsible for the administration in Egypt and of others in England who have a fundamental knowledge gained by experience of the system of Government in that country should be invoked.Consequently the first question that arises is whether a more effective control from home than that exercised at present over the administration of Egypt is either desired by Parliament and public opinion or is to the advantage of the Empire and of Egyptian interests in their present phase. As far as Parliamentary control is concerned it is difficult to see how the scheme propounded by Lord E. Cecil makes it more effective than now. Parliamentary control does not depend upon whether a department is inside or outside of the walls of the Foreign Office, while administrative control is more likely to be efficient when exercised by a body experienced in the tactful handling of delicate matters than by a hybrid body recruited from Heaven knows where and with but little or no such experience. Whether the present control of Egypt is &quot; defective and inadequate &quot; or not the fact remains that Egypt has now been in British occupation for 35 years, and has developed under our administration into one of the most prosperous and contented of countries. It must be conceded that the progress and development of Egypt during that period constitute one of the brightest pages in the records of the Foreign Office. In writing this I have no desire to claim that this prosperity and contentment are primarily due to Foreign Office control, although the Foreign Office and Diplomatic service have contributed a considerable proportion of officers to the little band of administrators who have succeeded in making the Government of Egypt a success. The Foreign Office has never claimed to be a body organised for the detailed control of administration carried on in. foreign lands,&quot; but it has the advantage, perhaps from the training of its members, of being able to assimilate its views to foreign conditions and thus to inspire sympathy and confidence with the minimum of interference in administrative details. This has succeeded admirably in the past, and it is interesting to note that a very large slice of Africa now under the control of the Colonial Office, consisting of Somaliland, Uganda, Zanzibar, and Nigeria, has during a stage of transition been under the control of the Foreign Office with beneficial results. Egypt is still passing through that transitional period which will not have closed until a definite decision has been taken as to the future status of Egypt and the Sudan, whether as a Protectorate or as an annexed territory, which in view of the Sultan&apos;s health cannot be long deferred, and until agreements have been concluded with foreign Powers for the abolition of the Caisse ^ de la Dette, the Capitulations and extraterritorial jurisdiction which now hamper the progresive development of Egypt.
These are questions with which the Foreign Office alone, from its long and intimate experience of such questions in Turkey and elsewhere, is competent to deal, but they will certainly require at least another live years for negotiation and solutions entailing as they do the preparation of codes, the creation of new tribunals and the co-operation of foreign Powers. Vylien these have been satisfactorily settled it will be sufficient time to raise the question whether the period of transaction has not terminated and whether a new control should be set up to take the place of the Foreign Office. Nothing could be more inopportune than any such administrative change at the present moment, when the political situation in Syria and Arabia is in the melting pot and the chief concern of our policy in the Middle East, conducted as it is through the Eesidency at Cairo, is to resist foreign encroachments and the pretensions of France and Italy in Arabia and the Red Sea. The same situation prevails in Western Arabia, where we have to play the role of mediator between the Italians and the Idris.As for the responsibility of England for the internal government of Egypt, the change of status caused by the Proclamation of a Protectorate has made but little alteration. The responsibility was great before, and is equally so now. The Administration will also remain practically the same until the changes mentioned above have been negotiated at the end of the war and put into execution. No new and costly machinery is needed at present. The political control and administration of Egypt are working smoothly and effectively. There is no agitation, and little crime, and the people are very prosperous and contented. There is therefore no immediate necessity for any change.The High Commissioner, Sir R. Wingate, is a thoroughly experienced administrator, in whom the Government have confidence, while the record of his administration in the Sudan is remarkable. Thanks to his influence and popularity, he has &apos; C3!i able, with a handful of troops, to maintain peace in a fanatical country, while the Mohammedan world was seething with unrest owing to the entry of Turkey into the war.Ft is stated in the Memorandum that &quot; the control of Egyptian affairs is intimately bound up with other Near Eastern problems.&quot; This is perfeciy true, but the association goes further than Lord E. Cecil seems to be aware. It begins with the European Colonies in North Africa, and extends through Abyssinia to the Red Sea littoral and Arabia. Egyptian affairs are nearly affected by our relations with France and Italy in all these countries. Whatever may be the future of Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Syria, Cairo tends to become more than ever the centre of British interests in the Near East, and the point from which we influence the rulers of the Hedjez and other important Mohammedan countries. Many of these Chiefs will be subjected to competing European influences in one way or another, and cannot, for a very long time ahead, be effectively dealt with by any other Imperial organisation than the Foreign Office. Yet the Memorandum contemplates the withdrawal from the Foreign Office of the Arab Bureau in Cairo (the main Intelligence Office) and its subordination to the new and independent Department. This can only mean a complete divorce between Arab policy and the Foreign Office. Further comment seems needless.There remains the question of Turkey. Egypt will in any case be sensitive to what may happen in Asiatic Turkey. If the Ottoman power survives Egypt will be deeply influenced by events there. Sir R. Wingate considers this influence so important as to be likely to force us to annexation in order to prevent Turkish intrigue in Egypt, Everything here also seems to point to the necessity for the treatment of our interests in the two countries by the same Department.Analysis of the Memorandum gives the impresion that its author is preoccupied with the future of Egyptian internal administration. If this is so, it is all the more curious that there should be no mention throughout the Memorandum of the existence of the foreign colonies in Egypt. Their importance is well known. It is brought out in a Note by Sir W. Brunyate enclosed in a recent despatch from Cairo on the question of the annexation of Egypt. The leading business and professional men in Egypt, who provide the brains of the country, are drawn from a population of about 200,000 Europeans including the British colony. The question of the right government of Egypt must be misjudged unless the problem of co-operation with these people is faced in connection with that of educating and using, when possible, Egyptian native elements. Such co-operation must inevitably be best understood by the Foreign Office. Present developments are eminently satisfactory.   A commission is sitting in which, under the guidance of
a British Chairman, a Frenchman and an Italian are taking a leading part in the introduction of British principles into Egyptian law and administration. The work on which they are engaged is probably the most important reform since the institution of the Mixed Courts. We have, moreover, still to devise some method of giving the European colonies some voice in Egyptian legislation, a problem for which Lord Cromer and Lord Kitchener proposed solutions now out of date; these colonies are likely to increase in numbers and weight and, if they are properly handled, their influence should be a counterpoise to excesses of native feeling.As to the question of the modifications which it is desired to introduce into the character of British control over Egyptian internal administration, it would seem that Lord E. Cecil dislikes the almost autocratic position of the High Commissioner locally and wishes to reduce his powers. Equally objectionable, in his view, though its existence is not mentioned, must be the Political Department or new Foreign Office in Cairo, which, as an adjunct of the High Commissioner, has now been developed by the grouping together with the previous Agency Staff of the Arab Bureau, the Sudan Agency, an embryo Intelligence Department, and the Desert Administration in process of growth. This central office plays a very large part in the direction of the Egyptian departments. Matters concerning more than one of these are, in view of the weakness of the Council of Ministers, necessarily referred to it. Its personnel now contains, in practice, British members of the Anglo-Egyptian Service who have been attached for convenience as officiers de liaison. Reading between the lines of the Memorandum the intention appears to be to arrest this development which alone permits the British Representative to supervise the whole Administration. The management of internal affairs would be altered by obtaining more decisions from London over the head of the High Commissioner. This would be accompanied by a weakening of the personal influence and ascendency of His Majesty&apos;s Representative over both Egyptians and British Civil Servants which has hitherto been the main factor of our control. I think such weakening would be a mistake and that the High Commissioner&apos;s authority should if anything be strengthened. The Protectorate is proceeding on the basis of the unwritten law that the High Commissioner&apos;s advice must be taken. A number of organic changes must no doubt be made before or after the end of the war by Supreme Authority in England as part of the establishment of the Protectorate, and their effect will be to reduce friction with Egyptians, but a situation will still remain in which the intervention of the British Representative is constantly needed. Personal Government of this kind, compatible with perfect control from home where necessary, is understood in Egypt, and has, I understand, proved a flexible instrument of Imperial policy. The sketch of historical development given in the first few paragraphs of the Memorandum does not appear to be correct. We probably intervened in Egyptian local affairs as much as was feasible or desirable so long as our action in the country was capable of being made a cause for complaint by one or more first class Powers. But a large measure of discretionary power was not given to any i gent and Consul General without, design. This power should not be impaired so long as it is exercised on the general lines laid down from home.As for the scheme propounded by Lord E. Cecil. I see no advantage in it unless it is desired to create new posts and a costly machinery, of which there is no real need. It is proposed to create a new Department and to place it under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but to locate it outside the walls of the Foreign Office and to remove it from any kind of Foreign Office control. One may well ask why the new Department should be placed under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who is to be deprived of the services of his own expert advisers. It is even stated that it is important that the officer to be appointed head of the Department should not be selected from among the Foreign Office officials in spite of the fact that the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service are the only public services in England that have had any connection with Egypt and that they contain several first-rate officers of long experience in Egypt and with knowledge of the language. The staff that it is proposed to create is to be composed of officials &quot; drawn from the British Civil Service who understand the Government of this country and Anglo-Egyptian officials.&quot; It is difficult to know why an understanding of the Government of this country should primarily be required from such officials. Some^ knowledge of Egypt and Egyptian local conditions would be far ^ more useful. Such knowledge is already in the .. possession of many officials employed in and under the Foreign Office, but is not ordinarily to be found amongst the qualifications of other ranks of the British Civil Service.
The existence of the Egyptian Agency in London under Sir A. Webb, subject to the orders and control of the Egyptian Government, seems to be the stand-by of the whole scheme, and I can only say that from my experience in India of the operations of the Department of the Director of Supplies in the India Office in supplying the needs of India , the example is not one that I would wish to see imitated. I am informed that the Agency is conducted to the entire satisfaction of the Egyptian Government, and it will be far wiser in every way to leave well alone.As for the educational system, it is more likely to work well under the paternal control of the Egyptian Government than under a bureaucratic Department in London.To sum up. Although there is no desire to claim that the control of the Foreign Office should be prolonged indefinitely, it is maintained that in view of the doubts already expresed by the High Commissioner as to the future status of Egypt in the event of the Sultan&apos;s death, in view of the important negotiations which will have to be carried on with Foreign Powers in connection with the abolition of the Capitulations and foreign extra-territorial jurisdiction, and also in view of the diplomatic situation in Tripoli, Syria, Abyssinia, and the Hedjaz, where the efforts of the Foreign Office are at present concentrated on maintaining the position of the King of the Hedjaz against the political encroachments of France and Italy in Arabia and the Red Sea, the moment to close the transition period of Foreign Office control has not yet arrived, and any substitution of control from that of the High Commissioner to a Department somewhere in London would be likely to result in friction, lack of co-ordination, and the addition of a fifth wheel to the coach. In these critical times, when Egypt is administered under martial law, and for some time after the close of the war, the internal government of that country should be left in the experienced hands of the capable administrators who govern the country in the name of the Sultan, but under the High Commissioner, and who should be protected from unnecessary interference from home. In any case, the scheme which seems to have been put forward by Lord E. Cecil on his own authority and initiative should in the first instance be commented upon by Sir R, Wingate and other expert advisers in Egypt, since the authority of the High Commissioner would by its adoption be considerably restricted, and practically a new situation created.Under existing circumstances the control of Egypt is not a serious burden to the Foreign Office, but it was decided some months ago, long before the present proposal was put forward, to create a Middle East Department in and as part of the organisation of the Foreign Office, to which experts from Egypt and Mesopotamia (if the latter province remains under British control) would be appointed, by which a general supervision would be exercised over the administration of these territories, and without undue interference with the local Governments during the transition period of probably five to ten years, when they may be sufficiently developed to be handed over to some other controlling Agency. This new Department would be in close touch and in consultation with the advisers of the Egyptian Government, and Avould contain an Egyptian element recruited from the Egyptian Civil Service and other sources. This project still holds the field, but it is obvious that it cannot be satisfactorily put into execution until something more definite is known as to the future status of Egypt and Mesopotamia.   &apos;Finally, I would strongly urge that no sufficient reason has been shown for any immediate change of system, and that in these critical times, while all is going well, it is better to leave well alone than to seek a counsel of perfection in an endeavour to inaugurate a new scheme of administration in Egypt, the need of which has not been proved.H.September 6, 1917.
