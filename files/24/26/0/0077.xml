&apos;roperty of _.//07Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.CRW/022.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XXII.(September 19, 1917).After the Kornilov Rising.Now that outward order has been restored by the failure of ftornilov&apos;s rising, it is possible to review the situation as a whole,   The sudden collapse of Kornilov may well give an exaggerated impression of Kerenski&apos;s strength.   Although the latter acted with great promptitude, the success he obtained was mainly due to the mismanagement of Kornilov1 s. movement, which was premature and badly executed.     Kornilov himself probably acted honestly, but he seems to have been duped by Lukomski, his Chief of Staff, and politicians of the stamp of Aladin in whom he appears to have placed undue confidence.     The latter is well-known in England, ?;here he Has lived for many years past.   As a politician he is not a man to be relied upon.   He has moved from the extreme Left to the Right and gives the impression of having acted from opportunist motives.   Without any conspicuous ability, he is violent in his speech, and it is not surprising that a General like Kornilov, who has never taken any part in politics, should have imagined that in Aladin he had found a real political force.In the interests both of Russia and the Allies it seems essential not only that there should be a Coalition Government strongly backed by the Cadets, but that those Socialists who may join It should free themselves from the influence of the Sovyet. Now that the Kornilov movement has failed and that many politicians belonging to the Right have compromised themselves, there ought to be very much less danger of a reaction.   Thus Kerenski*S Government ought to be nble to move to the Right and act just as
Q 62.strongly against the Sovyet as against Komilov.    Whether Kerenski himself will shov; the necessary decision is uncertain. Reports from Petrograd seem to show that he is more or less played out and that he is unlikely to remain long in power.     If he retires when the next crisis comes, it is difficult to see who would take his place.   There is no/member of the Cadet party who Wfjuld make an abvious Prime Minister - certainly not Milyukov, as he has embittered the Socialists, even the Moderates, against himself.   It is possible that Savinkov might be considered suitable, though very little has been heard of him during the recent crisis. He is certainly not lacking in strength of character, while his appointment would be a guarantee to Alexeyev that he would hay  full powers in dealing with insubordinate troops.   Reports from British sources about the state of the troops paint a truly appalling picture of conditions at the front, end it may be taken that the moral of the troops in the rear is certainly no better. In view of this the most important question at present is the restriction of the army.   There can be no question of strong Government so long as the troops cannot be relied upon.    For example, in the case of land riots the Government cannot act unless it can use reliable troops to restore order.The new Cabinet of Five over which Kerenski presides seems to offer the best solution of the present crisis, though it can only be a temporary measure.   Kerenski himself has gone to Headquarters, and there seems every prospect of his giving his full support to Alexeyev.   In his absence Tereshchenko appears to be in charge. The latter has not been conspicuous for strength of character and has made enemies among the Cadets for the way he has moved with the times.    Both he and Kekrasov - especially the latter - have been hotly attacked for weakness in dealing with the Maximalists, for yielding %o the Ukrainians,, and for opportunism generally.
31Nekrasov has now gone, while Tereshchenko, who remains, appears, from his conversations with Sir G. Buchanan, to be moving towards the Right.   This is in itself an interesting sign, and it gives hope that the Government may now be able to move to the Right without arousing in people&apos;s minds the fear - of a-real reaction. If this proves correct, the whole Kornilov episode may proveto have done good.   It will have cleared the air by exposing thoseswho were, plotting under the Surface against the Revolution. It is to be hoped that very few Cadets will be implicated, because nc Coalition Government will be possible without the Cadets, and, if the Cadets have kept out of it, reasonable Socialists will realise that the Cadets are not a danger to the Revolution.     But the first thing that must be done is the suppression of the Maximalists. Alexinski, Burtsev and others are busy unearthing further proofs of the guilt of Lenin, ZInovyev and many of their followers.   Any further evidence against them that can be .collected in England or Prance would be useful.   Action against them would have to be taken quickly by the Russian Government, as until they are suppressed they will grow in numbers.   Private reports from Switzerland state that Lenin is going to Berlin from Switzerland In September to work with the, renegade Parvus on the paper Russki Vyestnik (German propaganda for Russian prisoners).   The object appears to be to poison tho minds of the Russian prisoners and then convey them across the Russian lines to carry on an agitation against discipline, etc If the Russian Government does not take the Initiative in putting down the Maximalists, the probability is that there will be another rising in Petrograd, but it would probably give people greater confidence in the Government if it were the first to act.19.9.17 RAL.
