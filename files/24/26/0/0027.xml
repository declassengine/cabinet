i/THIS DOGMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. cjr_C R E T.( WAR    C A B I N E T.G.T* 2027. Operations.From:-     General Barter, Russia. 11.9.17.To:-        C.I.G.S. War Office. 10.57 p.m.124.X.Korniloff is confined to his room with slight chill which probably is more assumed than real.    C.G.S- has just informed me as follows:-   If Alexteff is ((? called upon); by provisional Government to form new Government, possibly with full powers, Korniloff will have obtained all he wanted and is quite ready to stand aside .      Alexieff and Korniloff are working together in complete accord.   General Kaledin, head of the Cossacks, has sent an ultimatum to Government to the effect that he will side with Korniloff, with the whole of the Cossack forces, unless Kornilofffs demands are accepted.   The Commanders of the Western Front and of 1st and 7th armies have been arrested by their respective committees General Klembowski commanding northern front was again (? asked) by Government to assume supreme command, but has replied by resigning his commission.   Moscow and other great towns are quiet,.   No disorders yet reported from the front.   CG.S. general Lukomski has not been relieved of his post by Government and is still carrying on as usual work of the whole army.   Provisional Government is not issuing any operation orders .   I am informed from different sources that Millukoff has urged the Government to ask Alexieff to form a Government .   As Alexieff would only accept on the same terms as Korniloff this would be happy solution.   Korniloff has appointed General Krimoff to command Petrograd, General Dragomiroff to Kieff , and General Dolgorukoff to Moscow.   The troops at Tsarskcei are reported to have sided with Korniloff&apos;s Cossack Divisions. Trustworthy telegram from Petrograd states that Petrograd troops are
mmoving out to meet Cossacks divisions, but that they are o an undisciplined mob. All the railways are still obedient under Korailoff&apos;s order.
