(&apos;Tfrm DocumentHis Or&apos;&quot;the Property of . &quot;~&quot; Sectv&apos;s Government)!230SECRET.Intelligence Bureau. Department of Information.IFW/011.Weekly Report on Italy.   XI. &quot; Sept. 14th.Foreign Relations.Greece.      The evacuation of Epirus by the Italian troops is at last reported to be on the way to completion.     On September 4th the Italian Consul at Janina telegraphed to the Minister at Athens that the Italian troops, with the exception of 2 battalions, had already evacuated the town.     This was confirmed by the report ofH.M. Consul at Janina, who added that all French troops had been withdrawn from Prevesa and from all posts between Prevesa and Janina.     The Greek Governor-General of Epirus had arrived at Prevesa.Thus a considerable aause of friction between French and Italians has been removed.     But nothing is reported concerning Coritsa, and it appears that the French are still occupying a post within the. triangle of Greek Enirus, in which the Italians remain to guard the Quaranta-ITondstir Road.     Baron Sonnino, Sir Rennel Eodd reports, desires to see this post withdrawn as soon as possible but has no objection to the French remaining in control of the Larissa Brallo-Itea line.&apos;Vith regard to the Port-Control, the Italian ITinister at Athens has been instructed to claim Control at Patras and Prevesa for Italy, together with co-cperation in Control of other Ports (e.g. Syra) where the Italian Government considers it necessary.     The matter, it appears, has been reserved for discussion between the Greek Government and the British and French Naval Authorities.The Greek Government is said to be still disturbed by the size and activity of the Italian garrison at Corfu (T/estern and General Report Sept. 5th)
S.From a provate British source we learn with satisfaction that quite cordial relations (accentuated perhaps by common alienstion from the French - mostly colonial- troops) exist at present between Italian and Serbian military forces in the Saloniki zone.Serbia and the Jugo-Slavs.On occasion of the arrival of Mr. Pasic in Rome the gjornaled&apos;Italia (Sept. 7th) writes as follows&quot;We have eertain agreements with our Allies, which are the outcome of the recent visit of our Minister of Foreign Iffairs to Paris and London, and no one has any idee, of tearing them up, since the Entente is not in the habit of looking upr;;n treaties as mere &apos;scraps of paper&apos;.     The fact that these treaties were concluded between the Western Powers without the adhesion of Serbia - while on the one hand it may make comprehensible to a certain degree the language held by M. Pasic in a recent interview or the strange pretensions put forward by him on that occasion - is certainly not sufficient to destroy in our eyes or in those of our Allies the validity of those accords.     We beleive that of this fact the Serbian Premier himself is now fully convinced, and his journey to Rome, this premise being granted, can only be concerned with problems which so far remain unsolved and in regard to which M.Pasi6 will find us fully disposed to satisfy Serbia&apos;s just pretensions.&quot;The Giornale goes on to emphasise the grounds for friendly relationship between Italy and Serbia and the conviction that common-sense will prevail even in Jugo-Slav circles.This summarises the position taken up at present by the moderate pmss generally in Italy.In the interview with M. Pasic, of which an account was given in the last Report on Italy, Signor Bevionfc, the Deputy who ?/as with Baron Sonnino in London, spoke of a comoromise which the British friends of Serbia believed would be possible.     From a further letter to the Gazzetta del Ponolo, in which Signor Bevion%ives an account of the views and attitude of the British Serbo-phils, it appears that the suggested compromise emanated from them and had the approval or at least was not rejected by
} , Trumbic (who signed the Corfu agreement on behalf -of the Jugoslavs).     Signor Bevion  describes the oormromise in these terms:-&quot;italy givetfe her consent to the constitution of the Serb-Craot-Slovene State and obtains the Western side of Istria with Trieste and Pola and certain islands of the Dalmatian archipelago, the Bo&amp;che di Cattaro and Valona&quot;This suggested solution was, it appears, submitted to M. Supili (Beport on Italy X) who reserved his judgement on it, but it was rejected off hand by M. Pasi6.Signor Bevionf- goes on to say that the English friends of the Jugo-Slavs are ardent advocates of a complete understanding and even of an actual alliance between Italy and Jugo Slavia.     They &quot;think there is evidence&quot;, he says, &quot; that the necessity for a dismemberment of Austria has not been properly understood by the Entente Governments.     In their oninion there are clear signs, especially in France and England, of a differentiation of consideration and treatment between Germany and Austria.     It would almost seem that the Governments injquestion feel scruples about wounding the susceptibilities of Vienna bjjr speaking openly of the destiny reserved for Austria.     It may be that they are merely afraid of galvanising into fresh resistance the crumbling of the Austrian State the dissolution of which from within has already-commenced.     But one cannot bo sure that there does not really exist a mistaken political conception in favour of a concentration upon Germany alone of the military and political Offensive with relative indifference to the fate of Austria - a conception based on the erroneous assumption that the only enemy who has to be defected is Germany&quot;     In this case there weuld be all the more urgent necessity for an understanding between .Italy and the new Slav State who between them would have to convincethe Allies of the fallacy an3 the danger involved in the policy of sparing Austria.
Military Hatters.French and Swiss press -suggestions-for a ^combined Entente offensive against Austria as the shortest way to victory are welcomed and echoed in the Italian press.     Barone in the Giornale is the most author&amp;tative ckampion of this view.Another militgj (y topic prominent just now is the neglect &quot;by the Entente of the Japanese Army.     &quot;The Entente&quot;, writes the Corriere della Sera, &quot;is waiting for the Americans to join in and has not yet managed to make use of the help of the Japanese.   One dgiy this will he regarded as its greatest mistake. &quot;Internal Politics.The Minister of the Interior and the Food Controller.The very determined general attack which is being made on the Commissary General (Food Controller), Canepa and on the Minister of the Interior, Orlando, by the &apos;interventionist&apos; gruups   and which is extended now and again (e.g. by the Nationalist paper&apos;L&apos;Idea Nazionale) to include Boselli and the Ministry generally as eo-rejp/gonsible, i3 probably to be regarded as something more than the mere beating of drums which usually precedes the re-opening og the Chamber.     &quot;Vhile the charge against Canepa seems to be merely&apos;-his lack of    organising capacity   and general inadequacy, the demand for Orlando&apos;s removal has more complex and far-reaching motives.There is first his velvet glove handling of the anti-war Socialists, continued in spite oi their openly avowed sympathy with the Russian   maximalists ., their veiled threats of revolution (r-lluded to by Oiolitti in his speech at Cuneo of Aug. 15th) and their increasing activities as manifested in the riots at Turin and elsewhere, which were only in part due to bread-shortage.     In this policy Boselli clearly is with Orlando as is shown by his
recent reception of a Socialist Deputation.     There is a genuinely-strong feeling that the Government has shown  emaidorah3re weakness in giving Elo free a hand to Socialist anti-war propaganda.     This propaganda would not perhaps by itself seem so formidable.     But to it ha3 te be added the more insidious, because less open and measurable, influence of the Giolittians - often said to be in secret allianceOrwith the Socialists and many Clericals, who denounce Socialism and are demSunced in return, but whose pacifism, coloured oossibly with Pro German and Pro Austrian feeling, tends in practice and at the present moment to reinforce the Socialist movement.     Especially is this the ease since the publication of the Pope&apos;s Peace proposals. The sort of influence that the Church is exerting in many places is illustrated b.,? the fly-sheet noticed in last week&apos;s Report and by other Press utterances.     It is on this -amount of weakness in curbing Neutralists that the loudest outcry is raised   gainst Orlando and the Ministry.     But in the background is the deep distrust aroused by Orlando&apos;s Giolittian origins and the fear that his continuance in office may lead to an eventual restoration of the corrupt and discredited Giolittian system of political dietatcrship.     The speech at Cuneo and the article devoted to it by La Stampa, in which all is were dotted and all ts crossed, have put the opponents of Giolittism and all those who desire the purification of public life, in Italy on their guard.Changes in Commissariat General.One pretext for attacking Orlando at the present moment is found in the breakdown of the ?ood Administration for which the Minister of the Interior is finally responsible and in the absence of Orlando, ov/ing to ill health, from the recent Cabinet Councils at which the defects and failures of the Administration were discussed.     Wtey
jfcey demand that if he is not able to discharge the duties of his office properly and in person at so critical a moment he should be at once replaced.     There is probably some further and unpublished explanation of the Minister&apos;s absence from Rome.     It may be connected with the strained relations which undoubtedly exist betweenhim and Canepa the Commissary General.     Orlando apparently desirescontrolto make the nominal/over the Commissariat into a real one while Canepa seeks to maintain his practical independence.   Memoranda setting forth their respective views on the reform of the Commissariat organisation were submitted by both to the Ministry and were considered at meetings of the Cabinet held on August 28th and 30th and on Sept. 4th and 7th.     Proposals for re-organisation were also submitted through the Minister of Public V&apos;orks (Bonomi), by the Administrative Commission of the Commissariat presided over by Cenepa and consisting of Deputies and Experts.     The serious position in regard to Pood control and distribution ana the frequent meetings of the Cabinet gave rise to expectations of immediate changes in the Ministry.     But Boselli has recently, in reply to a Deputation of Official Socialists, renewed his pledge not to allow an extra-parliamentary crisis and no changes resulted.     The Ministry obviously desire to get the Commissariat organisation placed on a better footing and producing bettor results before meeting Parliament in October. (October 15th is mentioned as the probable date for the re-opening)&apos;Then the Cabinet meets in October, it seems certain that the retirement of Canepa, if it has not occurred in the interval, will be insisted- upon and that Orlando &apos;s position will be seriously attacked. Suggestive parallels are instituted in the Press between his attitude ^towards Neutralists and that of M. Malvy:   and on Sent. 7th a resolution was adopted by the Central Executive of the combined Interventionist Parties demanding his replacement.
This Socialist Deputation referred to above crme to present to the president of Council an Order of the Day adopted by the   Parliamentary Gayoup of Official Socialists on 6. in the conversation which followed severely criticised, in connection with the Turin occurrences, the Government&apos;s handling of food problems &quot;and accused it of meditating a r&gt;olicy of repression.     They demanded the immediate summoning of Parliament,     To this suggestion Boselli gave a polite refusal but assured the Deputation that he should not go back on the undertaking against an extra-parliamentary crisis which he had given in the Chamber.The Vatican.The interpretation put by certain sections of Catholics (e.g. the Catholic Syndicalists) on the Pope&apos;s Peace proposals, an interpretation calculated to undermine the spirit of the nation and the strong shadow thrown on the Pope&apos;s blindness or indifference to-the moral issue by the clear cut moral judgement implied in President &apos;TIlson&apos;s fieply, seem to &quot;teej accentuating the already existing tendency to a division in the Catholic world of Italy,     Even high ecclesiastic dignitaties give expression to their shocked surprise at finding the Head of the Church outshone on a question of morals by a Protestant and mere layman.     This feeling, and disgust srtth the disengenuous, and anti-patriotic propaganda oof certain Clericals, is determining a reaction among patriotic Catholics, who it is said, will present memorials of protest to the Pope.17. 9. 17. -J.C.P.
