mmmm.OPERATION&apos;S   \From :- General Barter, Russia To :-     C.I.G.S., War Office.S E C RET.II/9/17,Handed in at 12.37 a.m.-1239.Fo 1 lowirig is&apos; the pre s ent situation..Korniloff persists in&quot;his refusal to resign.     All comnianders&apos;-:   of fronts have protested, to Government   against the removal   of . Korniloff.     General Klembovski who was yesterday appointed Commander-in-Chief by Government has refused the appointment and has protested, against the removal of Korniloff.     I have officially received copies of their telegrams.     Alexieff has. also presumably refused office.3  Battalions of Korniloff&apos;s own .regiment have arrived, at G.K.Q,. St, George !s Battalion/ which is here, is said, to favour the Government,.    The streets are being patrolled by Turcoman Cossacks. The Cossack Divisions are closing in on Petrograd.. All communication -between the front and..: Petrograd has been; stopped .by Korniloff or must come through Stavka.    Opinion is-prevalent here that Korniloff is gaining hand.     He has issued proclamation to the nation to the effect that he is acting only as patriot for the liberty and salvation of Russia with the support of all the Commanders at the Front.   He invites Government, under safeguard of his honour,, to come here and work -. 1 group undecipherable) with him a Government which will tackle present extreme crisis with the object of restoring order to the country. Special stress is laid by Korniloff on the necessity of having Government which -vill be strong enough to energetically prosecute the war to a successful conclusion.   The proclamation concludes with the following exhortation   &quot;Awake People of Russia from, the madness of blindness and lock into the gulf into which your country is hurrying he ad Ion/?,l!, .
I have telegraphed tho situation to Ambassador/     I have suggested to him the desirability of pressing Government if it is acting in good faith to publish correct statements regarding the sympathy of the Western Allies with Russia and the efforts that they are successfully making to help her.At the present moment the Press of the Extreme Party   is spreading   pernicious reports about the Allies without hindrance statinp; that our armies are everywhere being routed by the Germans and accusing the Allies of disloyalty to Russia,     These statements which are being readily believed by civilians and soldiers are doing much mischief.I am afraid: that Ambassador does not realise that the continuance of state of affairs hitherto existing must inevitably be disastrous to Allied cause and that the situation can only be saved by vigorous measures,  .. &quot;I. am not. against Korenski as I believe him to be honest in .intention and I think that ho should be included in any Government of the near future.     He is not at present however, playing, quite a straight game as regards . Korniloff ::and it can hardly be doubted that some; of Kcrenski1 s Ministers are pro-rGerman.There is every reason to believe that a few days after the Riga defeat he was ready to come to any arrangement with Korniloff-. The Government recovered, from its panic when the Germans suspended their advance for 2 or 5 days and now refuses to acknowledge the combination arranged with Korniloff by Kerenski&apos;s envoys.    These envoys were Savenko and Lvtv not the Prince of that name,Several senior officers were present at this interview and Korniloff told me next day that it was satisfactory. Later,    I have just heard that Korniloff has taken command &lt;3f the railways and that they are complying with his orders so far.
I am officially informed that communications are still passing between Korniloff and the Government.    I believe that there is still some hope that Government may adopt course which will save the situation in view of decision of the Prjnt Commanders to support Korniloff,
