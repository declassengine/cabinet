Section A.department of informationIUTBLLIGEUGE BUREAU.SOME   FINANCIAL   NOTES   ON   GERMAN   AFFAIRS. 18 September, 1917,THE POSITION OF GERMAN BANKS:The Frankfurter aeitung of Au^st 25th discusses in its commercial columns tbe position of the German Banks at the beginning of the fourth year of the He,r.     It says:-&quot;The profits which the bonks must have made out of brokerage on transactions in securities must have been very considerable for the first half of this year, and considerably larger than in any other period during tbe war.     The banks will be able to show a very good balance sheet.     They have become more than ever deposit banks.     The deposits have increased notwithstanding the payments for the War Loan, and, in view of the low rates the banks are allowing to the depositors, they are able to make a good orofit by buying Treasury Bills from the State, the Federal States or Communities.     Altogether the banks must have made a good thing out of the difference in interest.     No doubt the   opportunities for realising holdings of securities were exhausted, or perhaps permission to sell, was not obtained from official quarters.     But, in consequence of the rise in industrial shares, and tbe increase in the capital of Industrial Companies, the &quot;security account and the syndicate account ought to show a good profit, especially if the commissions on the large applications for the new loans are taken into account.     These profits may appear in the balance sheet, or they may be put to private reserve as before.   Banks have done well on the sale of their &apos;&apos;neutral&quot; securities and participations in neutral industries.     The expenses of the banks have increased very considerably and there is probably no prospect that they will be reduced now or directly after peace, and as everything is so very uncertain as regards the reconstruction period, great care will have to be taken in making out the balance sheet, especially as during the reconstruction period the increase of deposits will stop and the very small advantage of the difference of interest too. Difficult questions, and probably also risks, will then arise from eld connections, especially from foreign ones, and will require great financial strength and ample private reserves (Inneres Vermo^en).   To prepare for these possibilities is only common prudence.&quot;The net profits for the half year will be as good and probably better than last year&apos;s, and no doubt the second half year will develop equally well.     But for all that, there is no ground for enthusiastic expectations of high dividends or of a great rise in bank shares.    The rise which has taken place for many weeks with a small turnover has probably been caused more by the general tendency of the securities market. It can hardly be supposed that any of the big banks will venture to increase their dividends beyond the ones which they declared in peace time&quot;.
(Evidently the hanks are making strong reserves to meet prewar liabilities and bad debts).Appended are some notes on the sane and othersubjects from a reliable source:-&quot;The German papers , as well as the Bank statements themselves show great reticence as to their investments in War Securities;   on the other band, we all can appreciate the big Banks and their standing.     It seems that British financiers do not always estimate correctly the solvency of the big German concerns, which I believe are as safe as the prominent banks of Prance, England or Holland, and all the more so, as practically all their debtors have become creditors, owing to the abundance of money in industrial circles, which therefore do not need their credits any longer.     I therefore believe that their declaration of Dividends (Deutsche Bank 12-|$, Disconto 10$, Dresden 8-|$) is quite prudent and safe.    The last known quotations of their shares are of December 31,1916: Deutsche Bank 244, Dresden 151, Disoonto 182, Beichsbank 144. The last named have risen in the meantime - we heard a quotation of 154 lately - and so it may be that the others also Bhow higher figures.&quot;The surmise that Germany is going to provide Holland with coal is not correct;   Germany tried to get the counter-value in advance from Holland (along the same lines as Switzerland) -I hear about fl.10 millions a month - but so far the Dutch Government declines to come to an understanding on these terms. I therefore do not believe that they will be able to get the necessary coal from their Eastern neighbours.    On the other hand, Dutch Exports to Germany have been practically stopped, which fact accounts for the present comparative steadiness of the German Exohange.&quot;To give an opinion about the possible course of the Mark when peace comes is a rather speculative kind of business. My own idea - which, by the way, is I believe shared by the Dutch Minister of Finance, who wrote an interesting book about the Economical future of the Netherlands - is that the abnormal conditions will furnish their own remedy.    The depreciation of the Mark in, let us say Holland, will enable the German post-bellum Exporter to decrease his profit-margin considerably on his sales (owing to the exorbitant prices he can make over there for his articles in Guilders), so that he aan sell his goods under market prices without loss.    His serious competition will therefore cause imports from Germany to follow, to such an extent that the scale of the trade-balance will turn in favour of that country.    Dutch Exports, in coa-sequenoe of the same reasons as stated above working in opposite directions, can therefore only take place with a profit to their dominions oversea until the normal prices of the Mark and the Austrian Crown are restored.    5?hia course of events, which I believe will happen, will of course take some time, and it is impossible to predict how long the present depreciation will continue, as even after the war Germany will have to buy the necessary foodstuffs, as well as the raw materials essential to their manufacture of Export Articles.    Naturally Germany will be in a position to export Immediately when peace comes: coal, iron, potash, etc.    How much these factors may influence the trade balance nobody can
predict as jet;   moreover, I oannot believe that tbe hermetically-closed German frontiers will be opened again directly after the war at a moment&apos;s notice.&quot;ADVANCES ON GERMAN CLAIMS ON ENEkT DEBTORS:A Committee of 24 economic associations in Hamburg-have sent a memorial to the Chancellor to ask for .assistance from the Government in order to make advances on German Claims on enemy firms.    The following is an abstract of the document&quot;One of the chief reasons for the unparallelled development of German economic life before the war was that our traders did not use the profits gained in their businesses for investments outside, but always employed theni for tbe enlargement ox their businesses.    This applies particularly to our export firms, as the partners were wont to put their entire profits Work in their firm, and employed their profit balances to enlarge their business circles by giving credits to fresh clients with the new capital.     The German commercial cummunity differed in that way favourably - with a few exceptions - from English competitors in that they pushed their businesses by employing the whole profits in them.    Consequently the German export firms have been hit much harder than the English by the prohibition of payment of their claims, which, in most cases, represented the principal part of their assets.&quot;The awkward position in which many of the export firms find themselves has not been discussed much in public, the chief reason being that the members of these firms considered their credit their best asset, and have done everything not to jeopardise that credit by publicly announcing their necessity.     The medium and smaller export firms in particular have been very hard hit.&quot;The export firms stand as one man in their requirements and wishes.    They would not agree to the Governments making sny distinction on the ground of a firm being big or small, or its trads having been with European or oversea countries.     All are hard hit in the same way by the war.     All are equally needed for the period after tbe war.     It will be a cjiestion of rebuilding Germany&apos;s position in the world-market.     All have a claim in the same proportion for Government support in their difficult situation.&quot;It must be frankly confessed that there is a great deal of discouragement amongst the German export firms.     They are well aware of the magnanimity with which the English Government took over the guarantee for the discounting of commercial bills to the amount of z\ milliard marks by the Bank of England directly the war broke out, and, moreover, arranged to make advances on the claims on enemy firms to the amount of 50$.   This policy oompares most favourably with the attitude of the German Government, which up to now has done nothing to grant practical relief to the hard hit German export trade, and, indeed, has done a good deal to exclude that trade from relief, even in oases where it could have rendered great service.
kj %s &lt;u&quot;The parties concerned Lave beon told by the Government to apply for advances to the War Credit Banks.     These Banks have, in a few cases, granted credits to export firms, but, so fur as we can ascertain, this was only in cases where the creditor was a first-class firm, and where the debtor was also in a very good position.     Creditors, besides, have been asked to give special securities.     In such cases the borrower could have had a credit from any other bank, so that, for this purpose, War Credit Banks were superfluous.     On the whole these Wpt Credit Banks, as they are constituted at present, cannot be considered of any use for the requirements of the export trade. A real improvement can only be obtained ii, when credits are granted on the claims, the Government undertakes the guarantees. -Details can easily be arranged if only the Government will agree to the principle.&quot;After the Government has, to the satisfaction of all, brought in a Bill to subsidise the Shipping Companies so as to enable them to replace their tonnage, we confidently expect that the Government will not neglect the duty of taking measures to. meet the necessity of credits for the export firms.     It is only after the German export trade has been enabled to arm itself financially for the keenest competition in the markets of the world after the war, that German shipping will be able to reap the full advantage, as its interests have always been closely associated with those of the export trade.     The actual risk for the Government in undertaking the guarantee does not amount to anything in the slightest degree approaching the sums which are contemplated for the support of shipping.&quot;It is entirely in the interests of the legitimate trade that bad debts should not be considered.     If it were arranged that all claims for which an advance of 50$ is asked must be proved to be sound, there ought to be very little risk.    Most of the merchants would not require very large amounts now, as they would not wish to pay interest on the advances unless they had a specially good use to put them to.     The great thing is lor them to know that they can have an advance as soon as they want it. In that case they will start work with a will, and try to get connections now which will be valuable for the period after the war.&quot;(Berliner Bdrsen Zeitung, 3 Sept.1917).G.S.
Appendix.Tbe following is sent by a Financial Correspondent:The German papers have a controversy on the necessity of receiving an indemnity to avoid bankruptcy at the end of the *ar.    The Pan-German papers maintain that an indemnity is absolutely necessary, and calculate that the additional cb?rges after the war would be 12 milliard marks p.a. ( 600,000,000).     Articles in the Berliner Borsen Courier and the Berliner Tageblatt put the yearly expenditure after the war at between 8 and 9 milliard marks ( 400 -  450 millions).    Tbe figures are based on the war ending soon.The Bavarian Minister of Finance in an interview whioh he has given to a reporter also estimates the yearly expenditure after the war at somewhat over 8 milliard marks ( 400,000,000) and thinks that Germany can easily meet this extra expense.    From the different figures given in articles one comes to the following conclusion:         p.a,unded Debt......60 milliards    3,000,000,000 at 5$    180,000,000int. &amp; Up Sinking Fund.loating DebtDebt incurred by federal States &amp;&apos;Municipalities............ 30      &quot;  1,500,000,000 at bfo      90,000,000int. &amp; lf  Sinking-Fund.Reconstruction----20      &quot;  1,000,000,000 c.t 5$      60,000,000int. &amp; lfc Sinking Fund.Pensions for Invalids, Widows and0r?kans .............................................   100,000,000 430,000,000It seems, however, that the calculations in these articles do not quite tally with figures which the papers have* given on other occasions.     Although the actual war loan issues hitherto made, amount only to  3,000,000,000, the credits asked
for amounted to 94 Milliard Marks ( 4,700,000,000) and when the last oredit of 15 Milliard Marks was granted in July, the papers worked out that it would last 5 months, which would hring the figures up to December, provided the previous credits were then all used up.We take p.a. 4,700,000,000 at bfi int. &amp; ifo Sinking J&apos;und   ...     82,000,000 1,000,000,000 capitalised sum for Reconstruction    50,000,000    750,000,000 Federal &amp; Municipal Debt ...       45,000,000(This item is included above under the total floating debt. This estimate of  750,000,000 (or 50$ of the total) for the federal Stotes and Municipal debt is probably an under-estimate.)Pensions     ............       100,000,000TOTili......      ......      477,000,000(which is over 9jr milliard marks). If the war should last another year at the present rate of expenditure of  150,000,000 per month, say for 9 months from December, to which month the present credit may last, it would mean a capital outlay of  1,350,000,000 at bfo interest and 1% Sinking Fund    81,000,000, and the pensions would require probably  30,000,000 more.      111,000,000 together.  p.a Pre War Taxes amounted according to higheststatement to     ......   350,000,000If war over soon, additional charges     ...     ...   477,000,000If lasts another year at least more      t/&gt;.     ..,   111,000,000 938,000,000The income of the German people before the war was 43 Milliard Marks ( 2,150,000,000), of which they spent about 28 milliards ( 1,400,000) for private use and saved about 8 milliards ( 400 million). The difference of  350,000,000 vsent intaxes no
doubt,Ix\ case tbe war continues tbe figures of the Esn-Germans are not far out,    No doubt the others may calculate that Germany can pay even the higher charge.    Amongst the suggested means of meeting the taxes is a levy on capital tax of  0$ &gt;/hich is estimated to produce 45 Milliard Marks ( 2,250,000,COO) and the Bavarian Minister of Finance expects the Income Tax to reach 40$.G.S. 19. 9. 17.
