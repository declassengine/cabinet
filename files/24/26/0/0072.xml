lHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S OOv^RNMENT.)S E CRJT. --&quot; WAR CABINET.G.T..  - 20720.1/120/346. 19.9.17.OPERATIONS IK ADEN HINTERLAND.With reference to War Cabinet proceedings of the 17th inetant I submit the following observations regarding operations in the Aden sphere with the object of retaking Lanej.In order to retake Lanej it will be necessary to send reinforcements of at least23 Infantry battalions; 2 Cavalry squadrons; Some additional artillery and a due proportion of other an?s;and to keep these troops in the country aa a permanent garrison.     This is not a large force but it could only be drawn from one of the present theatres of operations, as it could not be obtained from India.     Further, it is not impossible that the Turks might send up reinforcements from the troops they have in the Yemen, in which case we might have, to send additional troops*     I am therefore of opinion that it is desirable to defer Operations until we can spare such a force as will serve to expel the Turks entirely from our territory.     For this we should need probably a division.My chief reason for recommending a postponement is, however, that it is impossible to say what may be the developments in the coming winter in Mesopotamia and in the Sast generally, and to meet these developments we may conceivably need every battalion we can spare.     I quite recognise the force of the political arguments for ejecting the Turks as soon as possible from territory under our protection, but on the other hand no particular ill-effect has yet been produced by the Turkish, occupation.     I trust therefore the* the War Cabinet wilf press*for operations to be undertaken for the present.(Signed)     W, R. ROBERTSON.WAR OFFICE.19/9/17.
