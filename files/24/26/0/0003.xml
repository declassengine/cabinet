: Colonel Jones!(Thi&amp; Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)I onclose a Memorandum dealing with Admiralty Organisation and a chart illustrating my proposals, for which I should he glad to have, the approval of the War Cabinet .     The scheme      has been considered by the Board cf Admiralty and has been generally approved by them.  E. G.11th September, 1917,,-;
(This Document Is the Property of_ SECRET. His BritannjC^ ^ WT&apos;Memorandum on Admiralty Oi^anisation.1. The speed and power of modern-, navies and wireless telegraphy have fundamentally changed the control of naval warfare, and it is to-day-necessary to centralise it to an extent hardly realised 10 years ago. The situation is entirely altered in comparison with the days of sailing ships and before telegraphy, when the main lines of Admiralty procedure and organisation were laid down.   .;.2. The Admiralty Staff in London is now concerned not only with the provision, maintenance, and general disposition of the Navy, but with, the issue by. telegram and wireless of executive orders as regards operations. and the movement of ships, and I-have personally satisfied myself that this is unavoidable. The Naval Stall&apos; at the Admiralty exercises in relation to; the Grand Fleet some of the functions of the General Staff under the Commander-in-Chief, France, and a great portion of the functions of the General Staff of the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forces so far as the Navy is concerned, with this difference that our light forces are very frequently by day or night in actual touch with the enemy, whereas,the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forces is not. I have satisfied myself that under existing conditions this centralised control is also unavoidable.?&gt;. No system of Board control can be expeditious, and when the Board is a large one dealing with a wide range of subjects of. great complexity and diversity, it can only satisfactorily function as a Board on a limited number of important subjects of principle. ; It cannot to-day so function on operational instructions, sometimes of great importance, issued in its name at all hours of the day and night, and it is unreasonable that-responsibility should attach to it for advice on such matters.   .4. In fact in the present war at any rate the Board of Admiralty never has so functioned, and in my opinion cannot do so.. The position is unsatisfactory, however, to me as First Lord, to the Board as a whole, to the First Sea Lord who is Chief of the Naval Staff, and to his Deputy and Assistant, who in the name of the Board deal with operational matters by telegraph continuously without any possibility of consultation with their colleagues.5. In the War Office during the war the impossibility of a Board or Council controlling day to clay operations was recognised, and in January 191G the Chief of the Imperial General Staff was made responsible for issuing the orders of Government in regard to. military operations.6. It is in my opinion-desirable that the duties and responsibilities of the Naval Staff and of the Board as&apos; a whole should be more clearly defined, and I put forward below a scheme which has the result of strengthening the Board&apos;s control by delegation and definition, and has also the effect of regularising the position and responsibilities of the Chief of the Naval Staff. In other words, the steps proposed would make the. theeoretical collective responsibility of the Board as a whole or in Committee thereof more of a reality in respect of matters of principle, whilst relieving it as far as possible of a fictitious responsibility in respect of detailed executive orders.7. To give a clearer idea of the problem set out above, it is necessary to refer briefly to the composition and functions of the Board in relation to the Naval Staff and the Admiralty organisation as a whole. &quot;. -,.-   ,.8. The First Lord, is the responsible adviser of the Crown and Government on naval matters. He has as colleagues and advisers on the Board of Admiralty a number of Sea and Civil Lords, and he can in common with his colleagues named in the Patent, issue any order in the name of the Board if he can get one other member to sign it with him and also the Secretary. &quot;9. The First Lord distributes the business of the Admiralty amongst his colleagues for administration, but the departmental responsibility of each .member of the Board is not clearly defined; Nor .is it anywhere laid down what-class of subject should come to the Board as a whole for consideration.o   (33) AS 3770 1 (AS 3741)   Pk 2676   50   9/17   B &amp; S

First Sea Lord and.Deputy Chief of the Staff habitually. It cannot in my opinion be a satisfactory arrangement for the Second Sea Lord to take over control of operational matters possibly for one night, only when he is not in close touch with them in his work..13. The comparison of the Army Council and Board of Admiralty given in paragraph 10 shows this fact that there is no one at the Admiralty corresponding to the Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff. -Below Council or Board rank there are similar striking omissions in .the organisation having regard to the detailed work which must, in my opinion, be done at the Admiralty,,11. The Naval Staff engaged in War plans have admittedly not expanded as they would have liked to do and should have .done. Their -development, has &quot;been hampered -by the ever-growing difficulty of sparing highly, qualified officers from the Fleet, and by the cramped office accommodation in which they have been working. Moreover, the very magnitude of the burden imposed upon them by overseas military operations and- the ruthless submarine campaign has prevented them from concentrating attention upon plans for reorganisation.... 15. In order to remedy as far as possible at the present time the defects in the organisation (a) of the Board, and (6). of the Naval Staff, certain changes, and developments appear to hie to be necessary..16. In the first place, I propose .that day to day operational and executive orders should be issued in the name.of the Chief of the Naval Staff more or less as is the case with C.I.G.S. to-day. That he should be charged, inter alia, with bringing&apos; all matters of outstanding importance to the notice of the First Lord, together with all such other matters as the First Lord may indicate. - This is understood to be the procedure to-day between C.I.G.S. and the Secretary of State for AYar. . The Solicitor advises that a small addition to the Order in Council defining the constitution and business of the Board will alone be necessary. \ 1I also propose, that the Second&apos;Sea Lord should in future be, both in name and in fact, the Deputy First Sea Lord, and that in order to provide for the duties relating to Personnel, an Additional Sea Lord shall be appointed as Second-Sea Lord in the place of the Additional Civil Lord now temporarily seconded to the secretaryship of the Irish Convention.     &quot;&apos;. .   ; n i -i -.   - -

17. In the next place, it is-proposed to group the Members of the-Board1 into two recognised committees:  - .&apos;. =. . &quot; -* ..,   . (I) The Operations Committee, consisting of  -       = &apos; v&apos;First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, Deputy First Sea Lord, .....    Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, &apos; . (   :Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, and        .&apos;      &quot; Fifth Sea Lord, as necessary ;.   .-.        and .   .. . -&quot;.(2) The Maintenance Committee, consisting of       ; jSeond Sea Lord, Third Sea Lord, Fourth Sea Lord,. . Controller,          &apos;   ^.:&apos;..&quot;L.:&quot;;&apos;.       V;^      &apos;  -&apos; -*&quot; ,&apos;- - -  &apos;     Civii,Lord, &apos;. &apos;:             -        ;, Financial Secretary, with .- , , _ _    /..Fifth Sea Lord attending as necessary.The First Lord would be ex officio Chairman of both Committees..It is not intended that the members of one Committee should be in any way excluded from attending a meeting of the other Committee when matters affecting them or of interest to them are being discussed, and, it is proposed that the Deputy First Sea Lord should make a practice, as far as possible, of attending meetings of the Maintenance Committee so&apos;that he may keep in in touch with &quot;the Operations side of the Admiralty work, and act as liaison officer between the two side&apos;s.of&apos; the Board. A special Assistant Secretary, with: a staff, has been appointed particularly to deal with Admiralty Board business,- and he or his Assistants wi 11 attend; all meetings of Committees of the Board; and will be. responsible for the.proper issue of agenda and minutes.       &apos;.   &apos;. 7  . &apos; .-.&apos;.&apos;.;.7.&apos;.= r&apos;^.y&apos;.-It will be the duty of this Assistant-Secretary, to bring all. these minutes before the First Lord, who, either with or without the suggestion of .the other Members of, the Board, can place them.oil the agenda for the next Board meeting.By these measures it is hoped to make greater use of the.members of the Board individually in matters of importance,.and to provide for their being acquainted .with what is going on&apos;: generally. It is also hoped that by means of these Committees more effective use can be.made Of the Board of Admiralty as a whole. To take an obvious example, viz., the attack on the Dardanelles, the procedure would be that after consideration by the Operations Committee and reference, if necessary, to the Maintenance Committee for their views as to the provision of the necessary materiel or personnel, the proj ect would be placed by the First Lord on the Board agenda and would be considered by the Board as a whole.   /       : &apos;On the other hand, purely operational matters and the consideration of schemes for operations not involving serious questions of materiel or- personnel-would be dealt with by the Operations Committee and the decisions recorded in their minutes.Similarly, matters of less importance than would justify their inclusion&apos;; in the Board agenda would be dealt with by the Maintenance Committee of the Board, whilst matters of major importance. would-be referred from the Maintenance .Committee to the whole Board. &apos;.&apos;   18. In order to secure the proper submission of matters of prime importance to the Board, it is proposed.to provide in the detailed distribution, of business for all members of the Board, that they shall refer to the First Lord, with a suggestion that it should be entered on the appropriate Committee or Board agenda, any matter falling within certain categories of importance, which comes before them..   19, Coming now to (&amp;), the Naval Staff, the attached chart shows in diagram form the Chief of the Naval Staff and the Staff group working under him.-   The important .alterations or innovations are marked in italics, and show the addition which it is proposed to make in the Naval Staff.   The brief description of duties given on the chart will, I think, be sufficient explanation.   The duties provided for in the portions
&quot;printed&quot;in &apos;italics have hitherto in the main fallen to the same&apos;hard-worked staff which -. deals daily with the immense amount of written and telegraph work involved in naval operations.   Men,&apos;however conscientious and able, cannot think out abstract problems if daily they-are immersed in routine, though urgent and important, work.20. It is proposed that Admiral Wemyss, the new Deputy First Sea Lord, should particularly devote himself to these duties.   He will be daily in touch with the. operations and with naval strategy and policy, and will then be able (as the Second Sea Lord has hitherto been unable) to relieve the. First Sea Lord on an emergency.It will&apos;be his particular, duty to keep in close touch with .the Maintenance Committee of the Board and also with the various Commanders-in-Chief.&apos;.- He will be free from daily routine work; and I hope that these new groups of carefully selected officers will form a body by whom new problems and new solutions will be constantly.: under consideration. &apos;&apos;&apos;-^.&apos;&apos;..&apos;-//v--&apos;-^-v&apos;.&apos;.  ..&apos;  - It has also been arranged that the .Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, shall appoint a liaison officer between himself and the Naval Staff under the First Sea:  &apos; Lord;   It is hoped that the Commander-in-Chief will thus be kept in still closer touch with Admiralty views than has hitherto been-possible, and vice versa.21. By these steps, if approved, it is hoped -  &apos;. ,&apos; :        (.1) To ensure that matters of great importance and high policy be referred to the Board collectively. ^- &apos;-rr-/&apos;/:&apos;---^^&quot;  . :^     &apos;&apos;&quot;^-h.:   (2) To decentralise the business coming to the Board by utilising the Opera-.tiohs or Maintenance Committees of the Board as a.sieve before matters, come,to the Board.- (3) To strengthen and improve the Naval-Staff side of the Admiralty, and. to . .   .provide for skilled and untrammelled consideration of. War problems. . (4) To define and&quot;fix responsibility for naval operations orders, and regularise  &apos;  and limit the present procedure which permits unlimited power to be exercised without the- authority of the Board as a whole, or of any _ constituted section thereof. _ _        .. --.&apos;-.. (5) To do so without in any way limiting or abrogating the responsibility to   :&apos;,,the Crown and Parliament of the First Lord.&apos; , &quot; 22, I shall be glad to receive Cabinet approval.% -.     x-&lt;.-         . &apos;&quot;,&apos; &apos;:&apos;.&apos;;  &gt;.&apos;. &apos;.: &apos;:/ &apos;-.: ;&apos;-&apos;v&apos;.-&apos;.&apos;: ;&apos;  v -.&apos;:/.
