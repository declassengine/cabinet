SECRET/J. 209FromGeneral Barter, Russia*14th September 1917.Co I. G. S. War Office. -15 p.m.1253cThis morning Korniloff sent for me.     He is submitting unconditionally and has notified Alexieff who is grftfrxwg at Bittebesk that he will give his command to him this afternoon. He is issuing instructions in &amp;ame sense to troops here.   He is also from patriotic motives using all his influence with the Cossacks to induce them to remain at the front as they are saying at present that with Korniloff gone all is over and they may as well go home.     General Krimoff has committed suicide and Cossacks divisions are retiring from the neighbourhood of Petrograd:   the Government has concentrated a small army at Orsha and Korniloff&apos;s submission was in order that bloodshed and civil war might be avoided.     Alexieff is expected here at 3 this afternoon.     Korniloff is evidently very anxious that pressure should be brought to bear on Government regarding two important questions.     3Dst to point out that it will complete the disorganisation of the army if extreme measures are now taken in order to terrorise them.   2nd that extreme action t%BB g&amp; m ( ? against) Sorniloff himself will have a ruinous effect on the Cossacks and may lead to revolt on their part or to excesses by them in the interior which would be most prejudicial to allied cause.    .Korniloff is confiding to me private papers which he positively assures me are connected with his defence and which for a safe custody he wishes lodged at our Embassy.    I leave for Petrograd to-day to see Ambassador and shall probably return following day.   Kornildff is quite calm and his only preoccupation appears to be for his officers and his country.      No news from the front.
