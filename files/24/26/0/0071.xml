XvV RUSSIA,MILITARY.Decipher. Sir G, Buchanan (Petrograd) September 16th. 1917.D. 4.9 p.m. September 16th. 1917. R, 8 a.m. September 18th. 1917.No, 1454.Following for Chief of Imperial General Staff from General Barter.&quot;I arrived at Petrograd last night,   I had an interview with Kerenski this morning which was satisfactory if Ms statements can be depended on. I represented as object of myvisit that it was of the greatest importance to Allied Powers to know how present political situation was affecting military aspect in view of continuance or otherwise of our continual and violent offensive in France with a view to relieving German pressure against Russia and as regards continuance of supply of material.He said that strategical situation on the Front had somewhat improved.    Troops on the Riga Front had reformed satisfactorily and officers and men were working better together along the whole Russian Front, Kerenski is going to (?start) tomorrow or Tuesday amongst other things to concert with General Alexieff regarding contemplated offensive by sixth Army near Galatz to clear lower Danube.I asked him &quot;whether he considered transport arrangements would be satisfactorily arranged for supply of troops in front line before the winter.   He did not seem disposed to give much information on this subject.I pointed out extreme urgency of this question and suggested General Be Oandolle who is now in Petrograd should be placed at disposal of Government as an adviser on railway reconstruction.     Kerenski assented that this measure would be useful and expressed gratitude for offer.In reply to direct question Kerenski replied that he was confident Army was behind him and would obey his orders as Commander-in-Chief.     I also put another direct question to him as to attitude of Soviet wanting peace at any price.     He however remarked, evidently with a view to eliciting a statement that many people thought France and England were disposed to make Peace with Germany and to leave Russia in the lurch.     I protested most emphatically against possibility of such action on the part of Allied Powers and added that if they could count on Russia as surely as they could count on us we should be well satisfied.Kerenski stated that German Peace propaganda was now being directed more to making Peace with Western Powers than with Russia and that Germany intended to offer favourable terms to France and England at expense of Russia.With a view to trying to help Korniloff I (^expressed) view which I stated was shared by my colleagues at the Staff and our Ambassador that if extreme penalty were enforced against Korniloff it might lead to rising of Cossacks and perhaps to civil war..   He replied that there was no danger of this and that he had a telegram from Kaledin, Head of Cossacks disclaiming association with Korniloff affair.He
He added that If the Government were weak in this instance it would be impossible to restore discipline, as soldiers were being shot at the Front   at the present moment for insubordination.He could not make difference between Generals and soldiers after lie had reluctantly assented to death penalty.   Such penalty would greatly weaken his authority and would be used against him by Soviet.   Kerenski considered political situation in Finland improved and yesterday he received a deputation from the best elements of the Senate thanking him for extension of autonomy granted to them on August 26th.He had conferred last night with naval chiefs who thought German landing in Finland this autumn improbable as it was late in the season and violent storms were occurring in Baltic and fooc1 question for a disembarking army would be too difficult. He believed however in probability of landing of a German force at Pernau and said reliable information indicated that Germans were preparing an offensive against Dvinska,    I questioned him regarding possibility of immediate disorders In Petrograd which would be created by Soviet.   He laughingly replied &quot;Today was the day on which disorders were supposed to occur   and remarked that everything was perfectly quiet.    Kerenski throughout the interview was perfectly cordial and accessible to questioning but I am afraid that his statements are too optimistic especially as regards intentions of Soviet not to make a separate Peace and as regards friendly relations between officers and men.Official communication today states that on the night of the 13th   Turks attacked Russian troops on Mountain&apos;crest on border of Turco-Persian frontier in direction of Mount Shiva-tiret-resh and Buba-tiret-resh about 50 versts East of Revanduz, Notwithstanding resistance of Russian companies they were driven back beyond line of the mountains.Communique also states that Germans are preparing an offensive on the line of Dwinsk-Minsk.
