1 im        EERRO-CONCRETE SHIPS.V# _    : _-ADMIRALTY MEMORANDUM FOR THE WAR CABINET.:        The use of ferro-concrete for shipbuilding in lieu of steel has recently been&apos;developed in Scandinavia and in June last Messrs. Bernard J. Ives (Naval Architect and Surveyor of Lloyd1 s Registry of Shipping)   and A. Ingerslev (ofi the firm of Messrs Peter Lind &amp; Co.. Reinforced Concrete Engineers) were commissioned by the Controller to proceed to Scandina-via and report fully with respect to ferroconcrete vessels.   The facts and conclusions at which they arrived are summarised in this Memorandum,There are at present in Norway three shipyards utilised for tho building of these vessels, in one of which 16 vessels, having a deadweight capacity ranging up to 100 tons each, have up to the present been completed.    The ships now under construction in the yard include a cargo vessel of 1.000 tons deadweight capacity to be driven by oil engines, ana an Oro Carrying Vessel having a deadweight capacity of 2,700 tons is about to be commenced*Tho other two Norwegian yards and the yards in Denmark have not yet completed any vessel, though some small ones were ready for launching.   In Sweden one lighter of 175 tons has been completed.An examination was made of vessels actually in service, some of which had been used for cargo-carrying in tidal and land-locked waters for upwards of a year,       a vessel of about 40 tons deadweight capacity which was built as an experiment in 1911 by the Royal Danish Navy was also examined afloat.    This vessel was understood to have been in constant use. sometimes in ice conditions, carrying sand, stone, ana coal cargoes.Both in Norway and Denmark Royal Commissions have been appointed to formulate rules for building ferroconcrete vessels, and in Norway approval has been given for building sea-going vessels up to 1,000 tons deadweight.Norwegian Underwriters are willing to insure these vessels against ordinary marine risks at an increase of 50/  above the ordinary premiums, with an addition of 20$ to this total if the vessel were not classed by some Classification Society.The experience gained in Scandinavia appears to show(1) that the cost of constructing these vessels is considerably less than the present cost of constructing sleel vessels of the same size (it was stated by as much as 50$).(2) that tho weight of the hull of a ferro-concrete ship exceeds that of a steel vessel of similar dimensions,(3) that a, ferro-concrete vessel requires only about 50$ of the steel which would be utilised in the construction of a steel vessel of similar capacity.
(4) that ferrc-concrete vessels can be constructed much more quicjdy than steel vessels, the length of time stated to be necessary for building a vessel of 1,000 tons deadweight being 8 to 10 weeks preparatory to the launch,   a large proportion ef which time is necessary for developing sufficient strength in the concrete to bear the stress of launching operations.(5) that for use in tidal rivers or land-locked waters, ferro-conerete vessels are sound and satisfactory,(6) that practically no experience has been obtained of the behaviour of reinforced concrete under sea-going conditions, except that seawater does not appear to affect the concrete injuriously.    Reliable da.ta shouldbe available at an early date.(7)  that the ships which have been in use shew very little deterioration, and repairs which have been rendered necessary by collision &amp;c. appeared to have been easy of execution and as efficient as the original structure.As an experiment orders have been given by the Controllers Department for the building of two 500 ton ferroconcrete barges at Brentford* the first of wnich will be completed in about two months.    The cost is  8,350 per barge, which is practically the same as would be the cost in this country of a steel barge of oqual size.The whole position is being carefully investigated in the light of Messrs. Ives &amp; Ingerslev1 s report-, and it is hoped that it will be possible,   in the near future,   to construct a considerable number of 1,000 ton barges for over-sea use.    The installation of motive power in ferroconcrete structures is, thought to be impracticable until actual working experiments with the barges have been made.
