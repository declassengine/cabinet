\J x./ UgP^ Operations .SECRET.P.From :~   General Delme Radcliffe, Italy.C &gt;iaG .SWar Office .20.9.17.10.30 p.m.412  I am informed by Cadorna to-day that he has deemed it prudent to modify his plans, in view of the Russian situation, the arrival of four fresh Austrian divisions on Julian front and the reported approach of further strong reinforcements, together with indications of Austrian intention of taking offensive north of Gorizia.     He has now decided not to undertake another offensive on a great scale but to wait for Austrian offensive and to follow it up with a counterattack.He says that he has many reasons for this decision, among others the difficulty of obtaining enough drafts on account of the civil governments reluctance to proceed with sufficient energy with the calling up of men.   He says that the last offensive cost between 25,000 and 30,000 killed and about 120,000 casualties in all, of which, however, a large proportion we&apos;re slightly wounded.    He says that an offensive on a large scale, which might cost a further 300,000 casualties, would, if not entirely successful, have a bad effect on the morale of the country and leave him in a difficult position if pressure were brought by the enemy with further forces brought from the Russian front.   Pie, therefore, considers that Ms wisest course is to take up a defensive position for the present and to act according to circumstances, in any case preparing to renew the campaign in the spring with full energy and a largely increased ammunition reserve.   He proposes to withdraw as many troops as can be spared from the front line in order that they may be trained in training camps and that as much leave as possible may be given. A change is to be made in the organization of the Trentino front 3rd Army Corps west of Lake Garda is to be withdrawn from the 1st Army command and placed under Commando Supremo.   6th Army command will be dissolved and Sugana Valley included in 4th Army command.    General Ricci-Armani is to have a plateau command which is to be formed of the three Corps on the Asiago plateau but which will still form part of 1st Army.
