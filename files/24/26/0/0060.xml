J_TNs Document is the Property of _Hfs Britannic Majesty&apos;ss CovTr^nTI -proposed formula for Higher Educationfinance*W        1* &apos;9Ab I am proposing to make a series of Speeches, inthe North and West of England and in Wales during the nextfew weeks on the subject of the Education Bill now beforeParliament, I em anxious to obtain the sanction of the WarCabinet to my indicating, in general terras, that a largeshare tf the new expenditure on Continuation Schools will beborne by the Treasury.   After discussing the question withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer I submitted to him thefollowing form of words which I thought would meet the case:-*The Government feels that if these developmentsare to be secured within a reasonable time a large partof the burden must be borne by the Exchequer.   I am notin a position to give you a figure but I am authorised tostate that, in the view of the Cabinet, the developmentof Higher Education contemplated under the Bill shouldbe as liberally subsidised by the Treasury as iscompatible with giving to the Local Education Authori-itties, upon whomjwill devolve to administer the Act, an interest in its prudent and economic administration&quot;. Mr. Bonar Law has informed ma that he sees no objection to this formula being submitted to the War Cabinet and I should be glad to learn that it meets with their approval.18th September, 1917.
