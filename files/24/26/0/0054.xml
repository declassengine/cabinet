He is, howwer of the opinion from a careful expertfstudy, of the German press that(1) The drain of. men into the Army is oreating a serious shortage of labour;(2) Shortage of food is causing a deterioration in the efficiency of the civilian working-class population;(3) Although there is an intense longing for peace in Germany, the economic position in itself will not cause Germany to consent to a peace acceptable to her adversaries.He considers that during the last two months the tone of the press indicates that the people are assured of a final victory through the U-boat campaign and the defeat of Russia, and that they are now more warlike than they were twelve months ago.     He sees no possibility of a revolt of the German working class; in fact, he states that the middle class in Germany are actually reproaching both the Majority and Minority Socialists for their want of courage in pressing for democratic reforms, and look upon the Majority ^bciaiiats as mere tools in the hands of the Government*.   _On&quot;the other hand, it should be noted that the Conference, of the Metal, Workers&apos; Union, held recently, passed with only a small majority a resolution in favour of the policy of the Majority Socialists.     But resolutions in German Socialist and Trade Union circles on political matters are unreliable indications of probable effective   &apos; action.     In Dutch Socialist circles, the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt11 is looked upon as a more courageous democratic organ than the &quot;Vorwarts&quot;.     The .opinions of KEEK SACHSE s,re shared by the majority of Dutch Socialist leaders.
