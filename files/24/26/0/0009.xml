(This Document is the Property of rftis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)Copy No.87/965.D . 0. M. A,Air Board Office.I would like t  bring to ycur notice that the Fokker Triplane brought down one of our machines today. This machine seems to be formidable.-Why I have written again:is to point out that the enemy is very much quicker at turning out machines once ho has got a new idea,    I may be quite wrong, but it is quite probable . he started making the Fokker Triplane when the first Sopwith Triplane was seen on the front,.... This was roughly about eight months ago and now the Fokker Triplane is a working proposition and is being used on the front in some numbers.From this it seems that the enemy is quicker than we are at getting new machines on the front from the time they arc asked for.       .. (Sd,)     H, TRENCHARD.Major General. Commanding Royal Flying Corps,in the Field..(C.R.F-.C. 1623/l7,l.G.)6th September, 1917-.
