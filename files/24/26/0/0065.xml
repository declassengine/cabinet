[This Document is the-Property- of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government!        273Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1917.SECRET.INTERNALLY COUNCIL.of an Inter-Ally Council in its present form was not of our seeking. It was practically imposed upon us by the American Government, and is required by them in the main for political purposes, viz., to render the position of Mr. McAdoo easier with Congress, and to convince the American public that the demands that are being so plentifully made upon them are for military purposes pure and simple, and are not designed to promote the commercial interests, or to build up the commercial future, of any of the Allies. It is for this reason that the Americans have laid stress upon calling the Council by the absurd designation of &quot; Inter-Ally Military Council &quot; (which, of course, it is not), and that they suggested the presence upon it of Lord French, who could hardly be spared for such an object.2. The principle of such a Council having been accepted by all parties, and its&apos; position as a part of the necessary machinery for conducting the war having been defined, it remains only (l) to call it into existence as quickly as possible ; (2) so far as may be, to satisfy the American scruples as to composition and functions; (3) to make it the coping stone of a really business-like and efficient organisation.3. We have pressed strongly that American interest and responsibility should &apos;be emphasised by the appointment of an American representative, whom we offered to make chairman. But this suggestion has been twice refused by the American Government.The French Government wanted the Council to sit in Paris. But this was really out of the question; and in order to conciliate their interests it was then proposed to offer to the French the Chairmanship of a Council meeting in London. This offer was welcomed by M. Clementel.4. The present position is as follows : It being understood that each of the Allied Powers is to have three members, Italy has appointed hers from her representatives on the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement in London, and will attach the necessary experts to them. Itussia will doubtless do the same. France is waiting to nominate her delegates until she sees who are ours.5. Under the scheme which I am about to put forward (and which I learned from M. Clementel would also meet the views of the French Government) the Council itself will he in the main an honorific body, meeting perhaps once a month, and charged with the duty of presenting to the United States Government the requirements of the European Allies in the form of a programme or programmes made to cover as long a period in advance as is feasible. The real work will be done by the separate committees of the various Allies, whose place in the scheme I will presently explain.6. If these are to be the functions of the Council it should be possible to meet the views of the American Government by appointing to it as our representatives men of the highest position and prestige, whose names will carry weight with the American pubhc, but upon whose time we need not make an excessive claim.7. One of these must be a soldier, and I venture to urge that General Smuts be asked to undertake the task. His name carries quite exceptional authority in the States : and his appointment would emphasise the ostensibly military character of the Council and its duties.8. I am informed that one of the other members should be a public man of the highest standing who cannot possibly be suspected of Conservative views. Apparently the latter class of politician inspires a quite undeserved suspicion in the breasts of the present American Administration. I suggest the name of Lord Buckmaster as free from all such taint, and as likely to carry great weight both in America and here.9. The third British representative will be really the most important member, for he should be Chairman of the British Priority Committee, the functions of which in the proposed organisation I will now explain.10.^ It is clear that the British programme for submission, through the Council, to the United States Government can only be drawn up by the various Government [992]
Departments concerned with the supply of the items of which the programme is made up, viz. : Ministry of Munitions, War Office, Admiralty, Oil Pool Board, Ministry of Food. But the limiting factors which will at each stage control the requirements of these five Departments are (a) finance, (6) tonnage; and it is essential, therefore, that there be machinery to determine, in the light of these two controlling factors, priority between the demands of the five Departments. Hence there should be a Priority Committee set up, absorbing the work, and perhaps much of the personnel, of the existing Tonnage Priority Committee, and containing representatives of the Colonial Office (in the interests of the Dominions and Dependencies), the C.I.R., and perhaps the Foreign Office, as well as of the five Supply Departments and Treasury and Shipping Controller. .11. It will be clear from the above that the Chairman of this Committee, who will also be one of the three British members of the Council, will fill the most important post of all. I suggest that an endeavour be made to secure the services of Mr.&apos; Austen Chamberlain for the task. His name, qualifications, and experience render him better suited than any other available candidate for this double and very responsible task.12. The attached diagram shows the proposed organisation of the British section. Probably the French, Italian, and Russian sections will be constituted on somewhat similar lines.13 It is contemplated by the American Government that the Inter-Ally Council, in addition to endorsing and presenting the programmes of the European Allies, will also act as an instrument for determining priority between one national programme and another, when a reduction in the total European requirements is necessitated either for financial reasons or by an actual shortage of some important material, e.g., steel; and a note from the American Ambassador, received while I am writing this, in connection with Greek demands, suggests this as the principal function of the Council. It is nut easy, however, to see how the Council is to discharge this duty ; but the Priority Committees of the various countries, if they all meet in London, will provide ready machinery for the discussion of relative needs in detail, e.g , if there were a shortage of steel, the munitions representative or representatives on the British Priority Committee would at once form a sub-committee with munitions representatives from the French, Italian, and Russian Priority Committees, and endeavour to arrange a revised requirement on behalf of all four Allies to correspond with reduced resources reported to them from America.14. I am sending a copy of this note to the various Ministers concerned, and I suggest that an early decision should be taken by the War Cabinet, as the matter is one of great urgency.15. Perhaps if the Council proves a success, it may acquire the larger authority which the American Government appears to assume.C. or K.September 18, 1917.Inter-Ally Military Council.French Delegates (3), including Chairman of Council.Treasury.
