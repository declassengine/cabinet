-;;\dmiralty msmoramdusvm ^to^Qabikbt,R VI    Provision of additional Sea-Transport jgy       for the movement of troops.With reference to the Memorandum  y the Chief of the Irnperial General Staff on the above dated17th Beptember, arrangements can be made by the Admiralty for escort and convoy for the proposed expedition, provided it u accepted that the ordinary operations of the destroyers In the Mediterranean,       which type of vessel is the only one suitable for this duty,   be wholly or partly suspended during the movement of the troops.      The annnnt of dislocation that will be car sod to the ordinary services on the station will depend noon the rapidity with whioh the movement of the whole reinforcing expedition is carried out.      It would be most undesirable/except under the pressure of the very gravest necessity, to transfer additional destroyers to the Mediterranean to supplement the existing resources of escort vessels,At the present time there are 13 large troop transports in the Mediterranean, and the proposal is to allot~27 more, making 40 in all, capable of transporting two Divisions of-aN-mt 40,000 troops and 17,000 animals at the same tine,     There are also 11 smaller troop transports ready or being prepared,   which are required for transporting ordinary drafts from Taranto, and these would not be available for this purpose, unless Salonica drafts are suspended and then these vessels only have bunker capacity to go as far as Egypt.There are 53 destroyers, including 12 Japanese, in the Mediterranean,   of which, at least one third are not available at any given moment,   owing to re-fit, boiler-cleaning, &amp;c.,   and 10 are constantly employed in the patrol of the entrance to the Dardanelles,   leaving a maximum of 25 destroyers avai&amp;ablo for esoortinp the expedition.To provide for the movement of the complete two Divisions at the same time, in 40 troop transports, It won id be necessary to form the transports into convoys of 10,   with 8 destroyers to each convoy as escort, and. trie, last convoy must thus await the return to Marseilles (say) of the first group of escorting destroyers?V!1^ean{\ f^1^        w 25 destroyers\nd alloS for saiimgsaat 4 day intervals and 21 days for the *Jv^?%/ /aSra ?   the aast convoy would arrive at&apos;BasrahSL&apos;Se       dayS af^er the nrst cn^v y had 6a*^d from jjatjr se ii i&apos;o s ^*~*A     nK\,dPStr,Ff?s v ld not PWoeW further than Port oaid.     ^ av,0ye duties would employ 16! of the available destroyers continuously for two we-ks,   including the timePotion   assenUy and disposal back to their n-V^^ ff1^1^? 8 destroyers for three weeks.to altan^i?!?10- ^rdircwv routine work must come to a standstill, m.cindmg the escort of the smaller transports with drafts if Continued, reinforoeSnts and remount
screening of the larger warships at sea, protect ion of special &quot;transport and store and supply ships, and various other duties for which only destroyers are suitable, and if escorting vessels are to be held in readiness for such a movement of troops the ordinary trade protection in the Mediterranean must suffer,  Merchant ships which would otherwise be escorted through the Mediterranean must either be delayed or diverted to the Cape of Good Hope route*   &quot;This means a loss of car-?o carrying capacity in addition to that caused by the allocation&quot;of the extra troop transports,   &apos;&apos;The alternative proposal put forward is to allot only 14 additional lar^o troon transports to this service, which together with the 13 now available would make 27 transports in all.Under these conditions, the 27 transports, carrying about I3 Divisions, would be .formed into    convoys of ST transports, each convoy with an escort of 8 destroyers. If sailing at 4 day intervals were provided for as before, the first convoy would arrive at Basrah in 21 days and the third convoy in 29 days.   The first thirteen transports would return rrom Basrah to Marseilles for the remaining i Division* and#allowing one week for coaling and delays, the whole would ^arrived at Basrah in about 75 days or loj weeks,    By this arrangement 24 of the available destroyers would be employed continuously for two weeks., and then at a later period   when the transports had returned to Marseilles for the Second voyage, 10 destroyers for another two weeks.   The destroyer time~occupied would be almost the same as before, but there would be intervals between, during which the ordinary traffic could be resumed and the strain on our resources wouid not be so /Treat,The most economical method, however, and the one which the Admiralty desire to advocate, is to employ 27 transports and sail them with intervals of 12 days between the convoys. By this means one  roup of 8 destroyers could do all the &quot; convoy work that would be required, returning to Marseilles for the new convoy after leavinr one at Port Said,   The remaining destroyers would be free to carry on their ordinary duties, and the general escort arrangements would be less disorganised, while the total time for effecting the movements would only be increased by about 8 days.Under this system practically J Division would be in Basrah about 21 days after the movement from Marseilles had commenced, and lj Divisions in 45 days, and the complete 2 Divisions in about 83 days.If the force to be moved could be limited to what could be carried in 30 ships, that is approximately a Division and a half, in case of necessity and by employing all the available destroyers for one trip, this whole force could arrive in Basrah in 29 davs from the first sailing from Marseilles, if Marseilles were selected as the port of embarkation(Signed  J,    % Jellicoe20th September-, 1917,
