ensouls ] !&gt;inxp-&gt;His Britannic. Majesty&apos;s GovernmentVO E?REPORT from the MXffTSTRY OF LABOUR on the LABOUR N\.SiTUATJON for the week ending 12th September, 1917.1. 3TTJKES.The strike at Pallar.re Dye .Vforks, Perth, reported last week  has&apos; continued, and has led to. considerable disorder, resulting in re-closing t&gt;$ tlw?. works.   On Wednesday the 5th instant the works opened- after- a weekrs closure, and a number of non-unionists, who attempted to proceed to work were assualted.   Certain of the polioe were also assaulted and special hostility appears to have &quot;been shown &apos;towards, the mounted constables.   On Thursday, at the request of the Sheriff -Principal of Perthshire, the Works were again&apos;closed.   &apos; :&quot;&apos;&apos;The immediate cause of the strike is&apos;a.demand for lo/- increase  in wages.&apos; It-is-however apparent that formal recognition.of the Union-is equally important .in the eyes of the strike leaders.&apos;  The firm has taken,the opportunity.to offer new conditions of work, and issued- a statement-.-on. 1st September proposing (1) a 48 hours week-for those-who start work.at 6.50 a.m. and a       hours week for those beginning at. 8.45, (2) a Bonus system, (3) the election of a Committee -of, employees to assist the Directors in preparing new scales of wages.   These proposals were rejected, on the ground that the Union is not recognised and that the statement as to 7/ages is not sufficiently explicit..  Hatters are now at a deadlock, but the Minister of Labour has arranged to see Ilr. Pullar,and hopes that a settlement may be reached.A number of disputes in the coalfields have given rise to local strikes.   Of these probably the most &apos;important is the strike of underground firemen or &quot;deputies&quot; at the Bargoed Coal Company1 s collieries in South &quot;.7ales.   The strike is in support of a demand for recognition of the Union aad for higher wages, and the dispute has now been pending for a considerable time.   Its decision willprobably depend on the decision ofthegeneral auestion as to theauthority which will try. such disputes in the future, This matter is already before the ,7ar Cabinet.  The Low Laithes Colliery (Yorkshire) is idle on the ground of a dispute as to the price at which domestic coal is provided for employees.   The question is being dealt with by the Coal Controller.There have been a considerable number of strikes in the Shipbuilding industry.   Kone of these are in themselves serious or important, but they are undoubtedly symptomatic of general&apos; unrest.   Several cases are reported of stoppages of work by workmen in order to hold meetings outside the yards during working hours.   In some eases no sanction has been requested from the Pirm concerned*, in others, when sanation has been refused, the men have ignored the refusal.   ;The more important cases of stoppage have been the following;-(i) 200 machine caulkers at the works of William Beardmore, Lalmuir, ceased work on account of a dispute as to piece prices.   Work was resumed next morning.1.
(ii) 100 squads of rivetters employed by this firm ceased &apos; work on 7th. September and are still out.   The Question at issue is the date from which a  wages Awerd should be applied.   The Award specified no date.(iii) 60 platers, struck on 31st July at the yard of McMillan and Go, Dumbarton.- The ground of dispute was the prices paid on bulkhoads.   The mom returned to work on 4th September, but certain of the. platers helpers then refused to work, owing to a disimteas to payment while tho platers were on strike. They resumed work the following day.(It) Over 100 Boilermakers and Engineers ceased work on 5th September owing to a difference as to extra allowances on an oil engine ship.   The dispute was settled and the men resumed work on 10th September.    ,(v) 70 Rivetters struck work on 5th September at Smith1s Dock, Middlesborough, on the ground of oomplaints made by the firm as to the quality of their work.   They resumed work on 8th September.In other industries also considerable unrest is evident,   in the weaving trado of Belfast and district over 18000 men are idle owing to the strike on the 10th instant of 400 overlookers for an advance In wages.The Garment workers employed by Messrs. Hart and Devy, Leicester, to the number of 8 0, have struck for a war bonus on civil work at the same rate as that paid on army work.A strike also occurred at Messrs. Waring and Gillowsr, for an increased war bonus, and involved the whole staff.   The stoppage of work lasted one day only.
ilia most serious, dispute reported- during the week is that of the Boilermakers on the -.QIjCq   &gt;!ho threaten to come out dn the ground that the National Award of 3/-/is insufficient to meet the continued increase in the cost of living.   Their action is not sup or ted by their Union, but Is being encouraged and the agitation organised .by an &quot;Emergency Committee&apos;1,which has the -support &apos;of the Clyde V/orkers Committee, the Provisional .Committee, -and-&apos;the Industrial - Workers o  Or eat Britain.&apos; It is reported :that a secret ballot has resulted, in a large majority in favour of a strike. At the same time it&quot; is doubtful whether the -unauthorised  /Committee will be strong; enough to overcome the resistance of the Union, and to compel the loyal men to come out.The Bradford. &quot;Joolcombers, whose claim was reported last week,, have suspended .their notices pending the result of the reference to arbitration,-The campaign of the. United Garment Workers continues. In the Wigan district, in support of a.demand for increased wages and contrary to the advice of the Union officials, the workers employed by all &apos;./ar Office contractors have handed in notices. The case, is however going to arbitration.The: ;Scottish Council of Textile Unions, representing 30,000 operatives,: has formulated a demand for a considerable increase in wages.   The dispute is being referred to arbitration.A dispute, somewhat serious in its potentiality, has oosETsred &amp;t &quot;the Driven Ferry Steel Company&apos;s &apos;.-&apos;orks, Glamorgan, The removal of an electrical engineer led to the refusal to work overtime on the part of 40 electricians and fitters. Strenuous efforts are being made to bring out all the engineers and fitters in   South &apos;Tales in sympathy.
London andIII. DISTRICT REPORTSConditions are quiet.It is reported that David Ramsey who has succeeded W&apos;.Ir. V/atson as Secretary of the Rank and;Pile-movement has declined to undertake the Duties until accounts have been audited,     Jatson has announded his intention to start a Revolutionary Industrial Union of; Engineering and Shipbuilding workers.   His attempt to carry on his propaganda for industrial unionism through the I.W.tV. has apparently failed and a meeting oi the latter which he addressed ended in disorder. &gt;.  .Considerable unrest has been created at the Woolwich Arsenal owing to a report that 20,000 mechanics are to be requisitioned for the Army.   It is stated that the men will refuse to allow the enlistment of any further mechanics wMle there are: 15000 members of the A.3.E., in non-mechanical units and that they will strike, if necessary.The labourers, oilers, beltmsn and millwrights* mates at Messrs. Cubitt&apos;s are discontented.   They claim that they should receive the higher rates of wages earned by semiskilled men for Sundays and for night v/orlc.   The men talk of appealing to the Ministry of Munitions on the subject.The situation is normal.L&apos;estern.1/8 31iidlands.[orkshire and[Midlands,forth ;ern.Though conditions are generally quiet, the Black Country miners are dissatisfied that the settlement of the Miners1 claim for a 25^ advance has not yet been adjudicated,&apos;   Protests have been made by organised bodies of Labour with regard to the constitution of the Pood Control Committees at Rugby and at [Wolverhampton.   It is ur^ed that no. person directly concerned with supply should have a place on these Committees.Dissension has arisen in the National federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors at Birmingham, between Sergeant Major Blythe, R.Eho organised the Federation, and Mr, Bilson, the General Secretary,   It is stated that matters will shortly come to a head.The position is generally satisfactory. . It is reported thai; C.&quot;2, lies haw returned. f,:om; a visit to the ;/estern I-ront and declares that &quot;he went to &quot;Prance a Paciiist and has returned a peace-at-any-price &quot;man, after the horrors he saw in Prance,&quot;The situation is normal.The action of the Ministry of Munitions to- solve the housing problem at Barrow is expected to allay discontent on this ground.The Manchester City Council and the Salford Corporation hgive received protests from the co-o&gt;erative Societies on the ground that they are not represented on the local food control committees.   The protest ad-&apos;ressed to the City Council included a threat that, unless the Co-operative societies v,&apos;ere granted representation on the Committee, the co-operators who number ISO,000 in that area would have nothin; to do with the Committee&apos;s business.It is re .orted th.t the Shop Stewards movement is making rayid progress in the Manchester area.Much discontent about food prices is reported from Liverpool and from Birkenhead.I.IThe
The Boilermakers on the Mersey are planning for a strike in October should the Award then due be deemed unsatisfactory.   This causes anxiety among the labourers, who are financially not in a position to stand a strike.The Durham Miners Association has initiated an agitation for an increase of the wage basis, which was fixed inl879, by 50^, and also for drastic amendment and extension of the provisions of the Minimum ./age Act. &apos;Representatives of the platelayers from Newcastle, York, and Bishop Auckland met at Darlington on 8th September, and framed a programme or demands including a 44 hours week, maintenance of the present war wage as minimum wage after the war, twelve days annual holiday with pay, and payment at the rate of time and a half for Sunday and night work.Otherwise in this area all is quiet,.7ith the exception of some small strikes, conditions are abnormally quiet.The Perth strike has been dealt with in Section I.The Iron Moulders are dissatisfied with the National Award of 3/- and unrest is being fomented by an unautho -ised and &quot;Emergency Committee&quot; which has decided to attest to bring out all the Ironmoulders of Scotland in protest. The Clyde Workers Committee has promised its support but success seems questionable.The Clyde Workers Committee, the Provisional Committee, and the Industrial Jorkers of Great Britain are considering the question of amalgamation.   At a meeting of representatives, the decision was postponed until the workers could be consulted.   HhManus urged   that the matter should be dealt with most expeditiously as serious events might be expected in England before 1st October.No change is reported.
IV.   EBBSS OPIBIOKS.OjQter Allied jooialist nbnference.Th^ Lahour Press containing accounts of and &apos;articles .upon the Inter Allied Conference has now been received. &quot; As was to he :ezjiected; those papers which supported the Stookholm idea express the opinion,  lag varying degrees of fervour, that the Conference was of value.    The organs of the national Socialist party represent the opposite point of view.     The former class is perhaps best represented by the &quot;labour Leader&quot;, whioh writes:- Among the delegates&quot;themselves there was also, it must be allowed, a &quot;general feeling of disappointment with the conference. &quot;Many, indeed the great majority of the delegates were &quot;dissatisfied that no clear proclamation had issued &quot;from it.     There were others; not perhaps more than a &quot;dozen, who, while gratified that no agreement had been &quot;reached on the Stookholm resolution, were manifestly &quot;depressed at discovering how much larger was the &quot;volume of support for the resolution than they had &quot;expected.The split between the &quot;majority&quot; and &quot;minority&quot; socialists* the latter of whom were represented in the British section out of all proportion to their numbers, has become exacerbated, and in &quot;Forward&quot; llr. Ramsay . Macdonald descends to personalities:-    ^Minorities &quot;and majorities were sharply divided and it was the &quot;majorities and not the minorities that had their tails &quot;between their legs.     In debate, in tactics, in voting &quot;the *taajoritles&quot; were &quot;minorities&quot;.    Belgium was &quot;apart all the time.    As Vandervelde said;   &quot;Y/e are &quot;isolated&quot;.     I have rarely known worse handling than &quot;the French majority showed.     Renandel spoke &quot;interminably.    Milhaud was a professional bore.   Y7hen &quot;they heard that the Russians were to take full part &quot;in the Conference they vociferated their disappoint-&quot;ment.    Finally they sulked..,The &quot;Herald&quot; lias the following comment t   &quot;The ^Conference&quot;self itself the impossible task of securing &quot;unity among all sections of Allied Socialisis at a &quot;sitting pasting only two days,     This/woifld have been &quot;out of the question in any case:   it was rendered &quot;absurd by the .attitude of scrae of the continental &quot;majoritaires&quot;.    v/iien the/Conference broke up, the &quot;British delegates were convinced that much longer &quot;preparation would be necessary to secure&apos; the suocess &quot;of Stockholm or ofJ any International Conference.&quot;The attitude of the French majority repreSenta^-tives is also subjected to severe adverse criticism in the &quot;Call&quot;!but that the quarrel between the socialist groups Is not of an international charao ter. is established by the resolution of the Trades ynion Congress #n the subject of Stockholm.    The importance of the cleavage in the ranks&apos;.of British labour is    . demonstrated by the fact of.the necessity for that resolution and the practical unanimity with which it was passed.ttr. Will Thorne&apos;s remarks on the subject of the relations of organised Labour and. the Government have stimulated, interest in that question which is discussed in&apos;ilie &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot; in an article     .   ~&amp;headed/
headed &quot;Labour - and the doormat&quot; which, though somewhat inconclusive, apparently supports the retention of office by existing Labour Ministers.   The &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; reports a meeting of the Stookport trades;C&quot;ounoil at which Hr . Wardle1s position in the Government gave rise to strong criticism.    The &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;.anticipates that agitation on the question may beoome~acxite., and points out that the withdrawal of Labour support would be a very serious matter for the Government.overnment Control.The Woollen Industry.Government Tohtrol.The Coal Indus try.The opposition of the Spinners to the action of the Board of Control of the \7oollen industry meets with, no support from the &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; which ascribes it to two causes:   first, the fact that the Board of Control has become aware of the inflated profits of the mazrufacturers, and second, the hostility of the spinners to representation of Labour on Advisory Committees.     The paper says:-     &quot;..... \&quot;e.;. trust that the Government will not allow the YTool &quot;Control Board to be destroyed.-     hey may rooqjsiise It, &quot;but Labour will claim its equal share with the &quot;Employers in the control of the Trade.&apos;JV:The &quot;Yorkshire Daily Post&quot; expresses a complaint from Barrow on the sub jeot of coal distribution.     &quot;The &quot;coal supply (for the Corporation Gas v&apos;orks} has been &quot;hitherto obtained from the Barnsley District, but now &quot;it must be from Durham.     Last week the gas produced &quot;at Barrow with the Durham coal was 6,700,000 cubic &quot;feet as compared with 8,100,000 when Barnsley coal was &quot;used.    The quality too is poorer.    As a big &quot;proportion of the Barrow gas is being used in the &quot;munition works, there are complaints all round.&quot; .Complaints have also been made in the &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot; on the ground that the coal supply for ,. London has been secured at the expense of that for the Provinces.. &apos;  .Government coctroi.The Cotton Industry?The arrangetients made for payment of the      ; unemployed firm the proceeds of the levy are generally approved by the &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot;..Induetrial &quot;Forward&quot; prints a Ion:; article on the subject of.Unrest.&quot;&quot;     the food supply and anticipates that its control mustfall  rom the nerveless hands of capital and be Eood ena     assumed by.

The constitution of the food control committees has &quot;been the subject of much comment.    Generally the enlistment of co-operative support is welcomed, but tne Manchester, Salifford and District Traders Defenoe Association has protested against over representation  ; of co-operaters, and the Blanche ster Guard! aa&quot; approves of the aotion oiT the Saifora council which lias decided that no interested person shall be a member of a Food Committee, but that both private traders and co-operators shall be called in an advisory capacity when their advioe is required..Industrial The &quot;Woolwich Pioneer&quot; prints a &quot;Warning toUnrest.     Engineers&quot; by Sam Bradley.    He says &quot;The Government &quot;once again is proving its ineptitude in dealing with. Military       &quot;the Military Service Ao$ In regard to the Schedule feyrrloe iMe  .      Protected Occupations ..... Agreements are made&quot;only to be broken, and the Engineers will be wise not &quot;to rely too much on the deletion of the Dilution &quot;Clause in the last Munitions Act .... &amp;.H. 130 is npt &quot;an act of Parliament and the schedule can be abolished &quot;by a stroke of the pen.    The automatic working of the &quot;Military Service Act would of itself then nullify the &quot;dilution victory on the Muniti6ns Act.&quot;The &quot;Call&quot; has a vigorous protest against Mr* Maopherson&apos;s statement with regard to Paragraph 451 of the Kingfta Regulations, which forbids soldiers to take part in political demonstrations.
PART Y.QjHSRAL   REMARKS  - : &gt;   &apos;The Trade Union Congress at Blackpool has heen generally &apos; recognised as a great success in view of the number of Unionists represented, the absence of serious, disputes among the delegates, and the importance of certain of the resolutions at which the Conference arrived.The most important resolution which overshadowed the other items in the proceedings v/as that dealing with the Stockholm Conference. . It was, of.course, largely devised in order to prevent a breach within the Labour movement, &apos;On the other hand, it would be a mistake, to interpret it, as was done by a good many of the daily papers, as Simply a vote&apos;against the Stockholm- Conference.   Its true significance lies in its insistence on. the summoning of an International Labour Conference as a necessary preliminary to a democratic peace, and its vigorous protest against the refusal of. passports.   Both these points may be regarded as being endorsed by the great bulk of the Trade Unionists representee}, at the Conference, as there is a growing feeling among the working classes that no satisfactory or democratic peace will be. possible unless they have a&apos; recognised voice in settling its terms.   On the other hand, the fact of participation&apos;:yiA the Trade Union Congress in the arrangement of any future conference is likely to have considerable influence on its composition.   This is causing some alarm among the extreme section.   The &quot;Call&quot;, for instance, while welcoming the advance made towards internationalism, as shown by the resolution, considers that the Parliamentary Committee &quot;has taken the business of reconstructing the &quot;International into- Its own hands, and in so doing has wrecked &quot;the efforts of. thosewho, by experience and service in the &quot;International, were best fitted-to undertake, it.&quot;As was shown.by the over-representation of.the minority groups at the recent Inter-Allied Conference, the present constitution of the.. International does hot permit real Labour opinion&apos; to exercise the. power to which.it is entitled, and any revision of the constitution brought about by- the Trade:Union Congress would be likely to reduce the Independent Labour. Party and the British Socialist. Party.to a position of insignificance at any future International Conference.-   It. will be remembered that a vote excluding the minority from representation at Stockholm was. passed by a ..considerable majority at the Labour Party Conference, which indicates that, the main body of -Labour is determined not to participate unless it is able to exercise its proper weight.The other resolutions of the Conferenco have attracted less attention than they would at ordinary times, but a strong resolution was passed in favour of a forty-eight hour week,-and the&apos;principles of the !7hitley Report were generally approved, a special committee being appointed&apos;to examine it further.A resolution proposed by the Parliamentary Committee approving the formation of a Ministry of Labour and demanding an extension of its powers was also passed unanimouslyv   The Congress also passed a strong resolution on the Food question, but Mr,,Clynes&apos;s statement had a considerable effect in,. clearing the minds of the delegates as to the true position.
