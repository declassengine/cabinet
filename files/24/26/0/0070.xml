AKOTE OP CIVIL POPULATION TOWARDS UBM OF THE TOUTED STATES HA.VAL FORCES AT aOEEHSWWN.In-AdrdrajLty Memorandum for,wtfre War, gftfrtofr*The Vice-Adiairal Coixiandiag-in- Chief &gt; Coast of Ireland* reports that ill-feeling has arisen between the civil population of Cork and Queenstown and zien of the United States&apos; Navy owing to the association of the United States1 Sailors with the young women of these districts.    The sailors have &quot;behaved extremely well on shore and it is believed that the disturbances whioh have occurred, and which have taken the form of attacks upon young women seen walking with the sailors, have been fomented by Sinn Fein leaders with a view to securing the removal of United States1 ships from Irish Ports.As a result of disturbances of this nature, a civilian has died from injuries inflicted by a United States1 sailor and all leave has had to be stopped.At Qireenstown Cathedral on September 9th the Preacher referred to the flatter in his sermon and described .the United States1 sailors as vultures who were preying upon the purity of the daughters of Queenstown.The Coiocaander-in-Chief complains that no attest is made by the Civil Authorities to keep the peace and has requested the G*0 0  Cork and the E.I.C. Authority to draft sufficient force to Queenstown to preserve order.It is feared that unless the necessary steps are taken at once the effect on our good relations with the United States may be serious, and it is proposed to bring the position to the notice of the Chief Secretary for Ireland.Clntlld)    ELG./       *      19*9.17
