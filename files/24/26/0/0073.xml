I em entirely in agreement with him in his views that any attempt to check the movement by crushing it would only add to its strength, and attract others to its banner.(Initialled)   G.H.B,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 20th September, 1917
I have read with much intercut the Memorandum by Professor Arnold of Bangor which you kindly allowed me to see.   While impressed with the seriousness and, indeed, urgency of the matters he deals with, I very much regret that he has hot brought to bear on them a more judicial outlook-.That the Labour Revolt is spreading: that the influence of the email group of doctrinaire&apos;. Marxists &quot;whose Bible is Karl Marx and whose policy is to strike first one blow and then another until Society collapses&quot; ; is. extending; are facts v/hich require no exaggeration to emphasise their seriousness.   The latter, however, are only to a small extent responsible for the spread of feelings of revolt.   The real reasons are to be found in a series of causes, which are clearly stated in the various reports ef the Commissioners on Industrial Unrest, more especially in the Report of the Welsh Commission.   The temper which iB bred by these causes, has given to the doctrinaire revolutionists an opportunity of which they have naturally availed themselves.   Their propaganda has had the effect of further inflaming the temper e-f the working-class, which, in this as in other countries, has become increasingly conscious during the war of the anomalies andihaqualities of our social and industrial system, .and was already in a condition of dan* gerous ferment.   If, however,  the Government deals with these issues in a big and generous way, fearlessly taking the side of the great class of the people, in their desire for a reasonable otandard of living, a larger measure of industrial freedom and-economic security; allowing no interest to stand in the way of such reforms as will make for greater social stability,  the effects of such propaganda, dangerous though it undoubtedly is, will be no more than temporary.   It is, however, desirable that the Government&apos;s intention to deal With these problems,&apos; should be known without undue delay..As you may not unnaturally ask what steps I have in mind, I venture to suggest the following.Much of the present unrest receives its inspiration from the conscious poorer of the &quot;triple/alliance&quot;.   To satisfy the legitimate demands- of the Miners and Railwaymen on lines that would safeguard tho interests of.the consumers, would do much to relieve the present strain.   Such legislation as would nationalise thes  industries,. and make possible a large measure of control within the industries by the men themselves would&quot; probably remove the two mo3t powerfully organised industries from the storm centre.   It would raise the status of the men from that of wage-earners to that of public servants, and give ther. a larger control over their own working conditions. There is nothing that does so much to steady conduct as responsibility.   The demand for a larger control over the conditions of one&apos;s working life is a natural and commendable one in a free corn-unity.   But the problem can best be worked out by experimentation in industries that are o^ned by the community, where the inherent antagonisms between capital and labour are softened by a sense of public service.The land problem is so interwoven with all other problems that it is unnecessary to emphasise how important a generous measure of land reform i3 for the establishment of happier relations between the various classes of the community...
The problems of^demobJJXaatdon- are equally acute.   The feeling of insecurity as to what may happen when the War is over is a big factor in the present unrest-  An extension of the system of unemployed insurance to all Industries ,. coupled with tin assurance that the present, spending power of no soldier or sailor will be reduced until he returned to workwould give a feeling of security with regard to the future that, would be extremely helpful .. But in estimating the spending power of each Soldier and sailor there ought to be included the cost o+fj^lothes and food required when demobilised.There are of course many other reforms seriously needed with all of which you are only too familiar .   I have only ventured to suggest those which I think are more urgent in view of present conditions, and even these I have only dealt with in order to remove any vagueness in my suggestion that working-class needs be met in a big and generous way.But It is the education*^Ide of the movement which is likely to be most serious In its permanent effects .   This is carried on vigorously by doctrinaire revolutionists who gather round them small groups of students .   The method adopted is the intensive study of the writings of Marx .   A knowledge of Marx should no doubt form part of any course in economics which, being non-partisan, aims at bringing the students in touch with the most authoritative writers of all schools of thought. But the exclusive study of Marxist doctrines narrowly interpreted, and imposed on students by dogmatic Instruction, engenders that attitude of mind which inflamed public opinion in the days of the&apos;religious wars and has found its most recent expression in the unhappy differences that exist between the north and south of Ireland.   Economic dojematism intellectualised by a course of study is undoubtedly giving to the students drawn from these classes an ever-Increasing influence over those who feel most keenly the oppressive and unjust conditions of working-class life and, If unchecked, it will ultimately succeed in bringtag about such relations between capital and labour that a resort to violence on both sides may become unavoidable .Any attempt to check this movement by crushing it, as suggested by Professor Arnold, would only add to its strength, and attract converts from all sides to its banner.The only effective method of counteracting the educational side of the movement is to cater for the intellectual hunger which has undoubtedly been stimulated by the events of the war, in a broader and better way - in other words, to provide increased facilities for lectures, classes and study groups where subjects of interest&apos;to workpeople can be threshed out, under University guidance, In an educational atmosphere, removed from anything in the nature of partisan teaching.   It is this work on which the Workers* Educational Association has been engaged since 1903, and with increasing success and recognition during the last three years .   It is hardly necessary to refer to the testimonies as to the value of the Association&apos;s method of work and the impartiality of its teaching given by the Board of Education in repeated Reports, the Royal Commision on the University of London, and other official bodies.   It may be mentioned, however, that the Y.M.C.A. has recently invited the help of the Association in organising educational work in its huts in Prance and in munition areas , and thet the Victoria League , as a result of successful experiments made by the W.E.A., has been encouraged x,o organise educational work in hospitals.
Professor Arnold appears to have confused the work of the W.E.A. with dogmatic instruction in Marxian economics narrowly interpreted.        The best comment on his statement is perhaps to. be found in the report of the Welsh Commission to which I have already referred.      Amongst the expedients to which it attaches most importance as a means of removing the causes of Industrial unrest is the provision of a larger number of our Classes.      It recommends &quot;the development of adult education by the establishment through the joint agency of the University Colleges and Labour organisations, of classes in industrial centres in which subjects of general human interest may be studied in an impartial and systematic manner, under expert guidance, whereby the relations of industry to the community and tho desirability of a broad and sympathetic outlook upon the complex factors of modern society may be adequately realised!    (Recommendation 47 pp.43).The recommendation contains no specific reference to the l//.E,A. but the machinery suggested, the organisation of classes under the -auspices of Joint Committees consisting of an equal number of University and Labour representatives, 1b that originated by the W..E.A. and now adopted, under its auspices, in every University centre in the country.The unanimity with which the three signatories to the Report recommend the further development of. pur work, after careful consideration of the mass of evidence submitted to it by representative witnesses of the .working-das-sea and employers, is the best refutation of Professor Arnold&apos;s statement &quot;that societies like the W.E.A.. belong to. tho movement to a man.&quot;{Sd) .
