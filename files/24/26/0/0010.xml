&quot;f&apos;THTS DOCUM.SECRET G.T.2010WAR CABINETNew York  8.9.17.Rec.   9.9.17.   8 pm.ftp* 265*.  Following is for Phillips from Northcliffe for the War Cabinet and Churchill:-In  rder to ^ain full benefit of the vast chemical and  ncineering resources of the U.S.A., it is essential British War Mission should be speedily provided with the services of the best available scientist possessing knowledge of chemistry and engineering.Urgency of this appointment is based on, firstly, military, secondly economic, and thirdly financial politicalgrounds.  &apos; //&apos;.Important factor in the war is rivalry between American end German chemists.   U.S.A. chemists are mobilising for ^ar: many of them are now in Washington, between 500 and 800 assemble in Boston next week.   They are evolving new gases and new processes and are determined to prove their&quot;superiority over German chemists.These American chemists are systematically selected by the great chemical companies from the ablest graduates of the many American Universities.    Most of them have visited Germany, some during the war.    Americans claim their chemical industry alone is now more than double that of the Central Powers.Germany foresaw America&apos;s possible assistance in the War and obviously feared it, for in mutual contracts made with ; :  imerican companies as far back as 1904 Germany inserted clauses forbidding exports by those companies to Europe of sulphurio acid made by German processes.Herewith I suririarise reasons for the appointment of science advisor to the British War Mission:-A.B.COalitary.    British War Mission should be able to inform  M. Government of new and improved processes in chemistry and engineering and in other matters such as for example steel producing.Since I have been here many questions of ana production of explosives and other material have come before me.   I have no expert advicor&amp;nd I am personally quite&apos;ignorant of these vital matters.   Case of the CURTIS BAY plant known to the Minister of Munitions was one in which expert advice would have saved time and money. .  In the matter of prices we would be helped by man of distinction and knowledge possessing tnat rare quality of o.ict in dealing with Americans, could obta:...n information from many real friends ofHeEngland in the scientific, chemical and industrial world.engineeringand
C.     Financial and Political.     Treasury wli:uiong-~ago haveappreciated that while France and Russia seem able to get almost unlimited sums from the U.S.A. the doles handed out to Great Britain are obtained with much difficulty &amp;nd accompanied by great flourish of trumpets on the part of the lenders.   This is not entirely due to the fact that John Bull the hereditary enemy now becomes the poor relatloru  It also arises from the great trouble taken by the French, Italian, Russian and even Japanese Allies to help and also please America,     I am most anxious not to enlarge British War Mission unduly, but It is obviously very unwise to have it regarded, as it is regarded by Treasury here, as merely     begging machine.In this matter of science the French have long had here a science mission under GRIGHARD, who has staff of assistant experts. He is a leading French Authority on gas and gas warfare, and delivers lectures to the war industry board at Washington on these subjects. He and his Mission are now on an extended tour in the United States, visiting and consulting with chemists, steel people find, many others.Impression created by the French in Washington and elsewhere Is that of great efficiency.   Their Military Mission, their Science Mission and their oration, pictorial and newspaper propaganda are wonderfully complete.   They lose no chance in organising festivals, banquets and holidays.My representative at Lafayette Day in New York yesterday told me that function was almost equal to that of arrival of Balfour.All these things are making our task more and more difficult. . Added to this* there is no German propaganda against Frenoh.   Whole Irish and^German propaganda is to the effect we are getting all the money ana/vaoing very little of the work.    We do our utmost to counteract these impressions by means of my personal Influence with friends on the American Press, but we have far to go before we shall have placed ourselves on an equality with the French here, and to- do so we must at least be as well equipped scientifically and otherwise as they are.       I do not ask another mission.   If H.M. Government could send me names of one or two experts which I could submit to HOUSE and Professor BOGERT, whose name and importance here will be known to any Member of the Society of Chemical Industries, it would enable me to give H.M.&apos; Government latest fruits of the chemical and engineering discoveries and inventions of this vast reservoir; of war resources.     It would also help READING in his great task. .
