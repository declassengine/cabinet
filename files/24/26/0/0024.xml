SECRET.property of3oy0rn:rhef.iIntelligence Bureau\Department of Information. CRV;/021.2094   ! .ifcSBKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XXI. y        (14 September, 1917).Some_A3pects of the Russian Crisis.While events are changing almost every hour it is only possible to deal with certain aspects of the crisis without attempting to judge what will be the outcome.   From a conversation with Professor Pares, who has just returned from Petror-rad, I have gathered certain facts about the chief personalities concerned, which shed considerable light on the crisis.   All that can be said for certain is that a fortnight ago Savinkov, Minister of War, and Komilov were working hand in hand, and the former was using all his influence with Kerenski to induce him to agree to Kcrnilov&apos;s demands.   Savinkov is a well-known revolutionary and republican and a man of very strong character.   In his hands the future of the Revolution v/ould be secure and the necessary measures would be taken for restoring the army.    If his influence with Kornilov had not been undermined the present crisis might never have occurred.A man of very different views and temperament to Savinkov is Lukomski, Kornilov&apos;s Chief of Staff. &quot; Lukomski was, under the old regime, Secretary of the War Office.   He is above all a carrieriste and an intriguer, and politically he is in favour of rection. His influence, therefore, with Kornilov, who is essentially a soldier and not a politician, has not been a good one.  The details of what has happened during the last week have   not yet been made clear, but it would appear that Kornilov has been carried off his feet by influences of which Lukomski is the centre.The leading figures in Petrograd at present appear to be Kerenski, Savinkov, Alexeyev, Milyukov and Tsereteli.     Savinkov has already been referred to.   Apparently he is now on the side
of Kerenski, having been appointed Military Governor &quot;of Petrogr&amp;d; hut it is unlikely that he will In the future blindly follow Kerenski&apos;s lead.   From all accounts Kerenski is now failing.     He has played a most inspiring part in the past and his services have been invaluable.   But since the Bolshevik rising of July 16 he has not shown the necessary strength, and his present Cabinet is not considered strong enough to rule the country and restore order.     His health {kidney disease) is also very bad.   For these reasons it is likely that Savinkov is prepared to step into Kerenski&apos;s place when the time comes.It seems probable that should Savinkov succeed, the man he would choose as his Commander-in-Chief is Alexeyev.     There is probably no finer soldier in Russia to-day than Alexeyev and, what is more, he has steadily refused to mix himself up in politics. The early successes in Galicia in 1914 were largely his work, and his strength of character as Chief of Staff under the late Tsar is one of the most striking features of his career.     After the Revolution he was forced to resign owing to his opposition to the infamous Order No.1, which more than anything led to the indiscipline of the troops at the front.   The events of the last few days, however seem to show that Kerenski is again turning towards Alexeyev for help.   If Alexeyev accepts Kerenski&apos;s conditions it will be the most hopeful aspect of the crisis.No man in Russia has been more abused since the Revolution that Milyukov.   He is a man of great ability and knowledge, though a politician rather than a statesman;    it was chiefly due to his lack of tact in May that the Coalition Cabinet failed. During the last month, however, he has become much more broad-minded, and he sincerely desires to save his country.     During the Cabinet-making in July he really tried to help Kerenski, and if he again steps forward his efforts must be regarded as sincere.
He is not as big a man as certain other members of his party, but he is their recognised leader, and no National Government would&apos; be complete without him.There remains Tsereteli.     He is a man with an absolutely clean record/ and there is no man in Russia more conspicuous for moral courage.   He would make an ideal dictator from the point of view of strength of character, but unfortunately he is narrow -almost fanatical - in his views.   This is due to lack of knowledge of the world.   He is still a young man aid has spent many years of his life in Siberia (ever since his courageous speech in tho 2nd Duma in 1907).        He too could not be overlooked in any National Government.No Government is possible in Russia which relies entirely on the Sovyet.   The Sovyet is not representative of Russia and would not be so even after new elections, which are now badly needed. On the other hand the Duma ulone is not representative.   Therefore a National Government must be responsible neither to the Duma nor to the Sovyet, but must contain representatives from both.     It must include representatives of all shades of opinion from Milyukov on the Right to Tsereteli on the Left.     Such a Government might save Russia and such a Government would willingly seek help from the Allies, but whether such a Government is possible time alone can show.   The best hope in the immediate future would appear to be a coalition between Savinkov, Kerenski and Alexeyev, which would triumph over the Kornilov-Lukomski movement.   If this coalition won it would probably be Savinkov who would lead the country afterwards-.14-9.17. &apos; RAL.
