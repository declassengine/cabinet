S V     wi&gt;OPERATIONColonel JonesSECRET.9 0From:- General Barter,. Russia. To:-       C.I.G..S., War Office.C.B.No.----18/9/17 d.3-40 p.m.To-day I had an interview with new Minister of War who to-day assumed office.   He is thoroughly trusted by Kerenski.    I impressed on him that on our front we were continuing a violent battle which would last several weeks and we were making great efforts to give the Russian Army time to reorganise and that for us it was very important to know if the Russians on their side were responding.   He assured me that in the last three months as far as the interior was concerned great progress had been made in raising the moral of new troops and in their training.    In a few weeks he would let me know how things were going on at the front. His one preoccupation regardless of political considerations was emphatically to restore order in the Army, and to convince all ranks of the necessity of continuing the war to a successful issue..His first object was to restore the proper authority of officers and to establish good relations between officers and men.    I was very favourably impressed with the new Minister&apos;s forcible personality.   Evidently he is a strong and determined man and intends to carry out what he says.. Referring to soldiers&apos; committees he was sure they would be with him and he stated as regards the Soviet in Petrograd that they only represented a fraction of the Army and he was going to try persuasion with them first.I assured the Minister in taking leave that he would have your best vrishes for the success of his efforts and that we were delighted that for his important post a soldier of his reputation had been selected and not a politician. There is no news from the front.
