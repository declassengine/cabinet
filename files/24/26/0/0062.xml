259G.T.2062WAR CABINET. AIR PREPARATIONS &amp; Q1IM I3M&apos; (Memorandum for War Cabinet by General Smuts.)Since the War Cahinet deoided in favour of the principle of unifying the two Air Services and appointed a committee   under my chairmanship to work out the detailed organisation, much useful work has been done.     The composition of the new Air Council and the distribution of functions among its members &quot;have been settled, and the drafting of the 3ill providing for the constitution of the new Ministry and the amalgamation of the R.U.A.S., and R.F.C., as well as the &quot;Discipline, Oode, Pay Warrant and King&apos;s regulations for the new Air Service have &quot;been entrusted to Bub-committees under the general supervision of Sir David Henderson.     The work of evolving the new organisation in proceeding smoothly and in due course it will be possihle to establish the new Ministry and Service,Important, however, as is this matter of organisation, it is still more important to push forward the preparations for the operations which may be expected next spring and summer and which may have far-reaching effects on the course of the war.     I have been going into this question and am somewhat alarmed at the backwardness of all our preparations, and would ask the War Cabinet to give the matter their most earnest attention.     I attach some memoranda which deserve careful perusal - one by Sir David Henderson on the scale of our &quot;bomhing offensive next spring and summer (Appendix I), and ene on aircraft supply hy Sir 3.Weir (Appendix II), with notes thereon by Sir David Henderson (Enclosure 1. to Appendix II), Commodore Paine (Enclosure 2 to Appendix II), and General Branoker (Enclosure S to Appendix II).     I have alse discussed the questions of aerial operations and aircraft supply with General Trenehard.     The main points brought out in these memoranda and conversations are as follow.  .Both from an offensive and defensive point of view qur Air.,preparations and operations deserve the closest attention. That the enemy is making a very special effort in the Air is undoubted_    General Trenehard is quite clear that the enemy has never been stronger In the Air than he is to-day, and that relatively we are- not so strong as we were some months ago.    If we do not maintain our superiority - and at present we maintain it with great difficulty - it may be most difficult to recover it later, and General Trenchard therefore presses most strongly for an acceleration of our, aircraft programme so that his position may X% Imprrtei instead of worsened before the winter. -He considers tfc* &apos; present Air struggle very critical even apart from what may happen next year.    As regards the campaign of next spring and summer tfc* ftaf among officers is general that the enemy is making very great preparations to recover ascendancy in the Air and that success for him In that respect may have very far-reaching consequences on the course of the war.     Even from the purely defensive point of view, therefor , we are called upon to make a very great effort in the Air.!g pocmim xa rag PHomrt or His guiTAMic majbstt&apos;s GOv^Rfflmn?,
a o i\I o 0-2-But our preparations should be on such a scale as not only to make our defensive position secure, but to enable us to gain a deoisive superiority on the battle-fronts so that the road may be clear for our offensive bombing policy against the industrial and munition centres of Germany.2.     As regards our programmes of construction the position is as follows.     Tho programme which General Henderson refers to In hie memorandum is the one settled in accordance with the demands of Sir Douglas Haig and General Trenchard for the Western front.     The carrying out of this programme according to timetable will, in General Trenchard&apos;s opinion, ensure the maintenance of our Air superiority, though In view of the growing enemy strength he presses strongly for its acceleration.   Beyond this programme the War Cabinet have authorised an increase which will involve a total establishment of 200 service squadrons of the R.F.C. in the Air by the end of next year.     This extended programme will give soope for a muoh larger offensive polioy than that adopted in the origin*! programme and reflected in General Henderson^ memorandum.    It is* however, becoming clear to me that we have not the resources to carry out to the full this more extended programme.   Even the original more limited programme 1b not being carried oiit according to time-table, and its execution will mean a greater allocation of Industrial resources to aircraft production and giving the Air priorities whioh at present do not exist.   If this is not done, not only our future offensive, but even our defensive position in the Air may be Jeopardised.   It Is not merely a question of aircraft supply, but of preparation of aerodromes, reoruitment of personnel of all kinds, and eimilar details.    Commodore Paine, who has very great experience in this matter, lays special stress on the training of pilots, which he considers the most important limiting factor in our Air expansion.     The important point to bear in mind is that for any polioy to mature by next spring and summer decisions will have to be taken and enforced now without any further delay and the necessary priorities will have to be given immediately.3.     As regards the original programme asked for by Sir Douglas Haig, and reflected in Sir David Henderson^ memorandum (86 squadrons on the Western front).. I consider that the Cabinet have really no option but must give the fullest and most complete priorities necessary not only to carry it into effeot but even to aocelerate It.    If this is not done, we shall run risks which may well prove disastrous.     The giving of full priorities will mean the curtailment of the programmes of other departments, as Sir W.Weir makes clear.    But that, in my opinion, is inevitable. The more limited Air programme should be carried out at all costs, and with the same priorities which were accorded to the shell programme in 1915.    These priorities ought to be given at once and thereafter the details can be gone into of what curtailments In other programmes should be effected.4.    There remains the more difficult question of the more extended Air programme of 200 service squadrons, which will give far greater eoope to an Air offensive next year.     The question ie really one of fundamental war polioy to be decided by the Cabinet after hearing the advice of their military experts. Prom a merely military point of view how do we propose to win the war?    Can the Navy win it,, and if not should we expend our resources on additions to the Havy whicn cannot affect the course of events at any rate during the present war?   Is there a
reasonable prospect of the Array,winning a decisive victory on the Ueste&apos;rn or any other of our fronts?    And if with the sobering experience which we have had for the last three years* we do not expeot any decisive military victory, hut only such success as will effectively undermine the enemy morale and dispose him to a reasonable peace, then it is to be considered whether an extended Air offensive will not conduce more powerfully to that result than almost any other form of military operations.   I am disposed to think so, although the subject is not one on which one would choose to be dogmatic.    I hope it may he possible, not only to give the necessary priorities for the more limited programme, hut for any reasonable additions which might conduce to a more effective Air offensive next spring and summer.     These additions and their efieot on other programmes could then be considered in detail.5.     In view of the great urgency of aerodrome construction, I would suggest that a special head he appointed to direct that task, either under the Master-General of Ordnance; or the Ministry of Munitions.     It has been suggested to me that Sir John Hunter, Director of Factory Construction, would he a very suitable person for the purpose, if the Minister of Munitions ^ill agree to the loan of his services for the purpose.     Sanction should also be given for the immediate occupation of the limited acreage (at moat 4,000 acres) of arable land required for aerodromes.(Initialled)     J.CS.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 18th September 1917.
A PP E IT 33 I X   I.BOMBING piTOATIONS._ (Memorandum by Sir David Henderson.)There are at present with the Expeditionary Force 4 squadrons of aeroplanes suitable for day bombing.   These are capable of flying in still air over 300 miles.   Allowing for light wind and for inevitable deviations from a straight course,  thejr could,  with reasonable expectation of safe return, bomb, objectives at a distance of 120 miles from the lines.By the end of October there should be five of these squadrons, and by the end of February thirteen.The Royal ftaval Air Service have now at Dunkirk some 12 day bombers, of the same type as those above mentioned, and, in addition, 12 long lange machines, which are, however, too slow for day work and oan only be used at night. The number allotted to the 3oyal Naval Air Service-of these types is expected to increase gradually during the winter, and by the end of February there should be 60 available of the first type.The other machines of these types in existence are only a small number, and are allotted principally to experiment and trainin.3, and indispensable for these purposes.At present, therefore, some 84 day flying machines could probably be collected to bomb an objective within 120 miles of the British front. Such an operation, if not continuously repeated, need not interfere very seriously with the llaval and Military work which must be carried on. But this range is not sufficient to reach Germany proper.Expeditions undertaken from other parts of the front, such as Nancy, in order tomgnable the machines to reach German territory would cause/serious interruption of the normal Work at the front.   The number that could be made available without danger, would depend on the plans of the Commander-in-Chief, and the activity of the German aircraft in different sections of the front.The suitable objectives in Germany which are within reach of these aeroplanes, working from the French lines are:-Distance from trench line.Blast furnaces in Lorraine Strasburg Karlsruhe MannheimStuttgart   (in still weather)The last is very near the limit of range, and any alteration of wind during the journey might lead to serious loss.   The most valuable objective is Mannheim.From October onwards through the winter, the number of these li.^ht bombing machines available will increase continuously, and by the end of February there ought to be something over 20025 miles.40     &quot;75 100       120     &quot;
machines available.   It is hoped that some of these will he of an improved type, which will be able to bomb objectives at a distance of 200 miles from our lines, thus including places like the Essen district, Cologne, Cofclenz, and Frankfurt.   It is to be remembered, however, that the Germans in the interval may also have improved their types of aeroplanes sufficiently to make these operations somewhat dangerous.The numberswhich will bo available next year are so dependent on the possibilities of supply that it would be useless to go into figures with any pretence to accuracy. Unless, however, quite unforeseen difficulties should occur, we may hope to have some hundreds of additional machines by August 1918, and .arrangements are already being made for their location in suitable places.   By that time, also, we ought to have 100 or so of the large night-flying weight-carrying machines, with long range, available.I have little doubt that this programme could be accelerated, but in order to crry this out, it.will certainly be necessary for air production in its^.various branches to have a higher measure of priority than/is at present allowed, and this not only in the actual matter&apos; of material and labour, but also in the choice of land for aerodromes, and possibly in recruiting.   It will be accepted, I think, that such priority as 7r3.il be required is likely to interfere quite seriously with the efforts of other departments;(Initialled)   D.H..D.G.M.A.12th September, 1917.
APPEHPIX   II. AERONAUTICAL SUPPLY POSITION IN RELATION   TO THE   GENERAL INDUSTRIAL SITUATION.Memorandum by Sir William Weir.To enable the Air Forces of the eeuntry to receive with certaintythe maximum supply of machines and engines of suitable oharacter for the Spring and early Summer of 1918, it appears essential that the Air Board should now review their contructional programme and at once settle all outstanding details.In considering this matter, I have become convinced that the fulfilment of the programme is dependent on a much clearer general comprehension of the proportions of the programme in relation to the general industrial position of the country and probably of such a re-adjustment of the manufacturing facilities as may be necessary to ensure the carrying out of the programme.   Further, it is a matter of grave concern to this country ae to what action Germany may be taking in regard to aeronautical eupbly for next Spring.    Attention has been drawn to the possibilities of Germany sensibly reducing her artillery and ammunition programme* possibly her transport programme and thereby carrying out a policy of industrial concentration on the production of aircraft.   Accordingly, in reviewing our position, it seems necessary to associate the programme with some definite aerial plan of campaign of an offensive character and to establish officially whether or not a re-adjustment of our industrial resouroes ehould be undertaken to ensure an overwhelming superiority in the air.   Unless this official authorisation is obtained, carrying with,it the necessary priorities of claim on industry, the realisation of the programme in proper time oannot be guaranteed.   The basis of industrial production consists of:-b.) Skilled labour. t) Unskilled labour.c) Raw material,d) Plant and facilities.(e) Overseas and international transport.With regard to aeronautical supply, and in particular the supply of aero-engines, the factor of skilled labour is of the Utmost importance, as only by means of a sufficient nucleus of skilled labour will it be possible to prepare the facilities to give employment to the large body of unskilled and female labour* which is available.   At the moment, it is almost correct to say that the total supply of skilled engineering labour of the civil* ian class   in this country is entirely devoted to essential war work.   Such war work can be roughly classified ae follows:*Oateflory, (A).Requirements for   offensive purposes or contributorythereto(1) Artillery, rifles, machine gune, ammunition, and other items for use by Armies in the Field. .(2) Aeroplanes, aero-engines, and general aeronautical auppli as.(3) Mechanical transport, including tanks.
-2-265^  Requirements, the provision of which has he en imposedon ufi lay German submarine and aerial policies and which are of a defensive character:-(1) Anti-aircraft guns for Kome Defence, antisubmarine guns for merchant ships, mines, depth charges, paravanes, anti-submarine naval shipping, patrol boats, mine sweepers&gt; etc.(2) Seaplanes,  ship aeroplanes, rigid and non-rigid airships, naval kite balloons.Category (C).Purely }&lt;aval requirements:-(1) Submarines, torpedo boat destroyers, lightcruisers, battle ships with their guns, machinery torpedoes and equipment.ategory.(P.).Requirements ancillary to the above-three categories;-(1) Merchant Service shipping.(2) Machine tools., small tools, factory buildings and   equipment for manufacturing facilities in connection with above.As a broad generalisation, it would appear to anyone conversant with industrial conditions, that skilled engineering labour would be associated with the above categories somewhat as follows;.Category (a):   Comparatively small ratio to the totallabour.Category (B):   Very high ratio to the total labour.Category (C):   High ratio to the total labour.Category .(D):   Moderate ratio to the total labour.In other words, it appears obvious that the greatest claims on our skilled labour supply are for the provision of requirements of a more or less defensive character.   Aeronautical supply, having been the last large service to impose its claim on industry during the war, has had to be content with a comparatively   small ratio of skilled labour and accordingly the rate of acceleration in supply can only be slow, because the character of aeronautical supply work, particularly aero-engine work, really requires a iugh ratio of skilled labour.To demonstrate the relative importance and dimensions of aeronautical supply in relation to other war supplies, the figures, of expenditure are of some interest.   Naturally, these figures are very largely estimates, but they are sufficiently accurate to show the position..     Annual expenditure on Category (a) 440 millions (of which iJO millions represent present rate of aeronautical expenditure}Annual expenditure on Category (E)   60 millions.ti it(C) 100 millions.(D) 80 millions.
to &apos;Total annual expenditure at present rates 680 millions, of ffhich. 50 millions are attributable to. aeronautical supply.On the basis of the 1918 programme for aeronautical supply-, the expenditure would be 150 millions.. It will accordingly be seen quite clearly that the expenditure on aircraft for next year represents a very substantial proportion of. the total supply expenditure.   These figures are intended to coyer only supply expenditure and do not include personnel.   Therefore, it: is submitted that, the fulfilment of the aeronautical programme, for 1918 will definitely, involve the diversion of facilities from other requirements.It may now be reasonably asked whether this aeronautical programme is large enough, and it would appear that this question can only be decided by consideration of true war polioy the influence of aerial strategy and a definite aerial.plan of campaign. It is necessary to insist on this point as even now the aeronautical programme may be suffering in its character from an indefinite knowledge of actual aerial policy for next year.    It is necessary also to reiterate the extreme urgency of an immediate settlement of this question, as any change in the existing programme for the Spring of 1918 can only be brought about with ample notice so that the manufacturing arrangements may be adjusted.   It is also clear that consideration of these matters, which are raised from the purely supply point of viewj must be directly associated with the necessary concurrent arrangements for supply of pilots, personnel, provision of aerodromes and accommodation.   In considering diversion of facilities, it is suggested that an investigation be made cf the programmes of artillery^ rifles, mines, lighter-than-air : craft, Beapianes, submarines, torpedo   boat destroyers, anti-aircraft guns for home defence, tanks, and ammunition, so that the influence of reduction ih these programmeB of varying amounts on the different items might establish their influence on an increase in the aeronautical programme.These notes have been prepared from the point of view that if it is decided to concentrate on an aerial offensive, such can only be realised by immediate settlement of the considerations herein referred to.(Sgd)   W. TOR.Controller of Aeronautical Suppli esU/9/1917.
12th September, 1917ENCLOSURES I to APPENDIX II Notes by Sir D. Henderson on Sir1 W. Weir&apos;s .Memorandum.I agree entirely with Sir William Weir&apos; 6&apos;views;   they deserve immediate consideration with a view to action.There is reason to believe that the Germans are concentrating a large proportion of their resources on the expansion of their air forces, and after making due - allowance for their difficulties of supply, there is some doubt as to whether our present programme will give us the measure of superiority which we desire before a period late in next year.   Acceleration is necessary in the provision both of material and personnel, and unless further priority is given, no acceleration is possible, and there is even some doubt as to the fulfilment of our present expectations.What is required is not so rhuch an increase in the maximum output arranged for as the attainment of the maximum output at an earlier date.There is not much hope of any great increase in the strength of the French Aviation service, and it is probable that the American development, except perhaps in pilots, will be subject to many postponements.(Initialled) .  D. H.D  G. M. A.
TEnclosure 2 to Appendix II(N0TE8 BT COMMODORE PAI2TS OH SIR W.V7EIR&apos;8mtORANDTJM)................I am in general agreement with Sir William  eiri but to my mind it is quite useless to discuss or arrange for means of increasing the proposed aeronautical programme for next year unless immediate steps are taken to provide additional pilots and mechanics for working and handling the additional machines.Pilots, to be of any real use, require practically eix months to make, and pilots for the twin engined big machines will take considerably longer.The training of pilots is limited by inferior type of personnel now available for making pilots;   lack of sufficient training machines and instructors;   and lack of sufficient aerodromes and housing accommodation.It is not fully realised, I think, that though an aerodrome can be acquired, and sufficiently levelled in a short epaoG of time, a school cannot be properly worked unless there are sheds for the machines, huts for the officers and men, water, drains, lighting, workshops, etc.,   These all take a very leng time to provide under present conditions, owing to shortage of labour, and shortage of material.The programme as at present laid out, if realised, will in my opinion, provide more machines by June next, than we can train the personnel for by that time.   It appears to me that we shall have to rely on the Americans to provide us with a certain proportion of pilots to man even the machines that are in contemplation in the original programme.In regard to the definite plan of an aerial campaign, I consider that no time should be lost in seleoting the points of departure, arranging for railway communication to be linked up with the points of departure, housing arrangements for the large number of machines required, accommodation provided for the personnel necessary, and stepa taken, at. once to start accumulating a large amount of bombs, stores, and general equipment on a large scale.It Is no use putting all these arrangements off, or largely off, until the machines are ready for delivery.I consider that maohines should be sent out in batches by air of anything from 10 to 20 to their bases, as they become available, so that the offensive may be started at the earliest possible moment with the least number of machines that can he effective.I am not aware of the number of pilots that the R.F.O. propose to be in a sedition to produce by the spring of next year.    Unier existing arrangements I do not anticipate that it will be possible for the Naval Air Service to provide and train more than an average number of 120 to 130 pilots a month with existing facilities, and it should be noted that at least three-quarters of these are required for seaplane pilote.12th September, 1917.
ENCLOSURE 3 TO APPENDIX II.NOTES BY GEKSRAL BRANOKER ON SIR W. WEIR&apos;S MEMORANDUM.&apos;Sir William Weir has put forward very ably the situation regarding the supply of material; and has clearly proved the fact that the other Services must suffer if we are to attain the programme which we have laid down.   It will be quite useless accelerating and developing this programme further if the other limiting factors of the situation are not dealt with in a similar way.   At present,we are striving to develop resources sufficient to produce 200 Service Squadrons in the Field&apos;, with the necessary units for their tranin;: and maintenance, by the end ofl918, but already our progress i3 delayed and is not up- to the standard required to accomplish this end.The three principal factors against progress are:-(1) Shortage of training machines.(2) Delay in   providing new aerodromes and buildings*(3) Slowness in recruiting the rank and file.The first item, &quot;shortage of training machines&quot; is being dealt with by   Sir William Weir.   Our present shortage, naturally, will have a very serious effect on our progress in the future; now is the moment that we want our full complement of training machines, and the fact that we have not got them is bound to delay eventual progress, although training maohincs may be available in great quantities at the same time as the service machines arrive at the desired output.{2)    &quot;Delay in providing new aerodromes and buildings&quot;. Our progress in taking up and starting new aerodromes is much too slow.   At present, the delay is caused by the difficulty of finding suitable sites.   Naturally, the Pood Production Department of the Board of Agriculture is very much opposed to any arable land being taken up for aviation purposes.   On the other hand, practically all non-arable land which i3&apos;suitable for aerodrome purposes, has already been taken.   At the moment we require 4,000 acres most urgently and cannot find the. bulk of this area except on arable land; this desire to occupy arable land is naturally strenuously opposed by the Food Production Department; personally I am certain that the loss of 4,000 acres of crops during the harvest of 1918 is hardy worth considering when the full requirements of this country in grain are taken into account.   Much time has been wasted looking for sites which do not exist, and I sm of opinion that the fact must be faced that, generally speaking, only arable sites are now available and that.if we are to obtain the number of aerodromes we require to produce the 200 Squadrons in time,; a ruling must be given&apos;allowing us to take arable land without discussion, beyond that necessary to.ensure that only inferior soil is occupied, and that farms are not unnecessarily broken up.   It is too early yet to criticise the, rate at which the buildings arranged for in the new programme will progress, but from past /
experience it seems probable that other works all over the country rill have to&apos;&apos;suffer in order to give us the labour and material that -e require.     The execution of these ^orke is entirely in the hands of the Master Ceneral of Ordnance.(?&gt;)     &quot;Sl0&apos;.Tnes3 in recruiting the rank and file&quot;. Recruiting at the moment la not no to the standard required if we are to have 200 Squadrons trained by the end of 1913. For the time being, this is not such a serious factor as it. would be if we had cur proper ruota of training; machines, but we are not even keeping pace in recruiting with our other developments, &apos;vbich, as I pointed out above, are backward       At tho moment, **e are short of about 5,000 men, and our policy towards the employment of women is almost at a-, at and-still owing to eel ays in the &apos;-Var Office at arriving at a satisfactory solution of the women&apos;s recruiting problem. It is difficult to foresee -&apos;hat course recruiting -&apos;ill take in the future, but it seems evident that ?rith the gro-ing shortage of men, the Flying Services must receive considerably better treatment than is the case ?X present, if we are to attain our end.     It must be remembered that at present nearly all the men :.:rho join the Plying- Corps are unskilled and must be trained as fitters, riggers anc1 in the other trades almost ab initio.To sum up, it seems obvious that to attain the establishment which has been sanctioned so far, we shall need a great cieal of assistance and other Services must suffer; to go beyond this establishment, it will be necessary for the Cabinet to adopt the policy that aviation is of more importance than any other brunch, and that in order to increase it they must be ruthless in cutting down the demands of other services.        like Sir -&apos;illiam &apos; eir, I view with apprehension the oossibility that Germany ie placing the development of aviation and the submarine service before every other enterprise.      If this is the new policy, it is difficult to see how, in present circumstances, we shall be able to fleal with the situation which may arise next Spring. On the other hand, if we adopt the policy which he anf I fear that she may adopt, we shall bo at least enual and probably superior to any efforts she may. make, regardless of the fact that our Army and tfavy have suffered in order to further this revolutionary proposal.     In any case the time is more than ripe for the Cabinet to tske a sorioua grip of aviation as it stands and as it may develop, and, having carefully weighed its possibilities with the apparently waning powers of the older forms of warfare, decide definitely what place in the order of importance aviation is to occupy during the coming year.     It is still not too late to augment our present programme considerably if whole-he artea and tfrastic measures bo adopted.(signed)    *:. S. B^AiTCXSS.D/D.G.M.A.11.9.17.
