[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the War Cabinet.  September 1917.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION No. 16.Week ended 9th September. There are no important movements of any of the Enemy main fleets to record.SUBMARINE ATTACK ON TRADE.The number of enemy submarines believed to have been operating during the week shows a considerable increase as appears from the following table : 	Numbers Operating.

The &quot; Nil&quot; result after the largely increased number of actions this week deserves comment. Our &quot; Eesults &quot; are very rigidly interpreted upon conclusive evidence only, and this is not obtainable as a rule for some time. In order that the Cabinet may gauge the situation for itself, a detailed report of all actions for the week is given in Appendix A.The following is a comparative statement of the number and tonnage of all vessels sunk in recent weeks by submarine and mine: 	British Vessels.

On the other hand, it appears from the figures that in the past few months the attacks are fewer but considerably more deadly. This is confirmed in another way, namely, that during the whole period of 7 months, approximately 50 per cent, of the tonnage(C 621)
attacked was destroyed, 10 per cent, damaged, and 40 per cent, escaped, while the percentage of tonnage lost to tonnage attacked in August was 62&quot; 3, the highest proportion for any month in the period, but the attacks in that month numbered only 132 as against an average per month of 201.It appears, therefore, that, although the enemy, when he does attack, attacks with an increasing measure of success, he is finding fewer opportunities of making attacks than hitherto. This points to the value of the system of .convoying Merchant Ships which has been adopted.It is not possible to give standardized figures of overseas sailings in the same manner as losses, because the figures for the earlier months are not available. Comparing, however, April and August and standardizing on the former month, we get the following interesting result: Tonnage of vessels sunk Sailings. and damaged.April      ......   100 100August   ...... 91.9 56.2from which it is seen that the percentage of tonnage sunk and damaged is very materially reduced.During the first 6 months of unrestricted submarine warfare (February to July), 572 British Merchant Ships of over 500 tons were sunk or damaged by submarine, namely, 496 by torpedo, and 76 by gunfire.The following table gives, in percentages, particulars respecting Submarine attacks in the months of February to July : Per cent.Vessels attacked which were defensively armed..................82.2Vessels attacked which were defensively armed and which escaped after using theirgun        .................................70.0Vessels attacked which were defensively armed and which were sunk or damagedafter using their gun    ...       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   21.0Vessels attacked which were sunk or damaged   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   .56.0Vessels attacked and sunk or damaged which saw submarine before attack ... 30.0 Vessels which were sunk or damaged in a calm sea      ............      ...   63.6Vessels which were sunk or damaged in a rough sea Vessels which were sunk or damaged in daylight... Vessels which were sunk or damaged round the British Isles Vessels which were sunk or damaged in the Mediterranean14.7 66.6 61.1 16.4The foregoing figures, which it is thought may be of general interest, demonstrate the value of defensive armament when the submarine can be seen before it attacks, and also shows that in the shorter days and rougher weather of the winter months a reduction in the percentage of successful attacks may reasonably be anticipated.The attached chart shows diagranimatically to scale the proportion of British Merchant Steamships attacked and sunk by torpedo and gunfire respectively in each of the 24 hours calculated on average figures for the six months February to July. It demonstrates that the majority of the submarine attacks take place in the middle of the day and not at dawn or dusk as has sometimes been stated.CONVOYS.905 ships have been convoyed this week as compared with 850 last week, and 771 the previous week. Three of these were lost as against 9 last week, and 6 the previous week.This week&apos;s losses are confined to the inward convoy, 1 ship of the Sierra Leone convoy -being torpedoed and sunk while under Destroyer escort; and 1, an oiler, being torpedoed in the centre of a convoy in the North Atlantic, the submarine not having been sighted. A second oiler was torpedoed on this occasion, but was brought into Falmouth.   The third loss in convoy was a ship engaged in the French coal trade.

During the week the enemy has concentrated his attention on the War Channel between Lowestoft and Thames, which has been heavily mined, and the traffic route in the Channel between Lizard and Dungeness which has been mined in six different positions. The latter was apparently with the intention of catching convoys which arrive off Lizard and afterwards disperse to proceed up channel.There were losses by mine off the Island of Lewis, off Blacksod Bay, and in the approaches to Kirkwall, and a Mine Sweeper was mined in the Harwich area.An additional 42 Merchant Vessels were fitted during the week with Otter equipment, bringing the total number of such vessels so fitted up to 343.The number of Warships fitted with Paravane equipment up to August 24th was249.STEEL SUPPLIES.The following is a Statement showing the allocation between Admiralty and Other Purposes of Plates, Sheets, Sections, Rounds, Squares and Flats produced in the United Kingdom during the months of July and August.Week ended.

The effect of this shortage of steel on the merchant shipbuilding programme is most serious. The figures for the week ended 1st September show improvement.MINOR OPERATIONS.A strong force from the Grand Fleet carried out a minesweeping operation and reconnaissance in the North Sea without incident, no enemy vessels having been sighted.Naval Forces bombarded Ostende naval base on the 4th September. H.M.S. &quot; Marshal Soult &quot; opened fire on two occasions, 14 rounds being fired each time. Further firing was stopped by the enemy&apos;s smoke screen. The enemy&apos;s heavy batteries replied vigorously.Some deep mines have been laid off the North-East Coast of England.A force from Harwich captured and brought in a Swedish steamer laden with German coal proceeding from Rotterdam to Sweden.On the evening of September 4th an enemy submarine suddenly appeared on the surface about four miles from Scarborough and immediately opened fire on the town,
and continued firing for about 10 minutes. Six Mine Sweepers in the bay opened fire and proceeded towards the submarine, who shortly afterwards submerged. A Hydrophone Drifter Section from the Humber arrived on the spot an horn later and, carried out a search but without result.Bombing Squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on Bruges Docks, submarine shelters and railway sidings ; also on Varsennaere and Ghistelles Aerodromes. The total weight of bombs dropped was about 20 tons. Five enemy aeroplanes were driven down out of control.   One of our machines failed to return.In the Eastern Mediterranean a raid was carried out on Adrianople on the night of 2nd-3rd September. Bombs were dropped on the railway station and bridge. The former was left in flames, the latter is believed to have been hit by a 65-lb. bomb.Bomb attacks were also made on the aerodrome and store houses at Chanak, and on Gere viz (South coast of Bulgaria).   One of our machines failed to return.An enemy squadron attacked Mudros air repair base and Marsh Aerodrome, doing slight material damage. Bombs were also dropped on Kephalo Aerodrome and on the ships at Stavros, but no damage was done.On the night of the 2nd-3rd September, enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Chatham Naval Depot, one of which fell on the drill shed in which men were sleeping : 110 men were killed and 123 injured.MOVEMENTS OF GERMAN MERCHANT SHIPS.To and from Norwegian Ports : Arrived, 5 ; Left, 3. To and from Rotterdam : Nil.RUSSIAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Baltic.The fall of Riga may create a critical situation if the Germans undertake operations in the Gulf of Finland, a not unlikely development, as the Finns are openly agitating for independence and Finland is a hive of German intrigue.The Commander-in-Chief of the Baltic Fleet thinks that the moral shock of the fall of Riga may pull the Fleet together. All shipping got safely clear of Riga and, so far as is known, the Russians still have in the Gulf of Riga 2 Pre-Dreadnought Battleships, 31 Destroyers, 8 Mine-Sweeping Torpedo Boats, 3 Submarines, 4 Gunboats, and a few Auxiliaries. The rumours of units of the German Fleet preparing to attack in the Baltic are not so far officially confirmed and it is likely that their rough handling last year on a similar enterprise, and the presence of British Submarines, may discourage such a project.The total Russian Naval Force in the Baltic is 4 Dreadnought Battleships, 4 Pre-Dreadnought Battleships, 9 Light Cruisers, 69 Destroyers, 28 Submarines, 12 Minelayers, 46 Mine Sweepers including Torpedo Boats, with many Auxiliaries. There are 8 British Submarines (C and E Class).At Petrograd there are building 4 Battle Cruisers, 2 Light Cruisers, 11 Destroyers, and 4 Submarines. 2 of the Battle Cruisers are already launched and might be completed by the end of this year and 2 by the end of next year. The Light Cruisers and Submarines should be completed next year.At Revel there are building 2 Light Cruisers (already launched), 16 Destroyers (including 9 evacuated from Riga), and 27 Submarines.White Sea.The last report from the Senior Naval Officer, Yukanski, states that the new Russian Wireless Station there is now working ; that a small anti-submarine boom has been completed at Ivanoski, and that stores for His Majesty&apos;s ships are arriving safely. Russian and British trawlers are co-operating in convoy and sweeping work. 4 Russian Destroyers arrived on September 4th at Murmansk.Convoys to Archangel are now very small from 2 to 4 ships. Those homeward bound are increasing from 10 to 12 ships.The Russians have 1 battleship, 1 cruiser, 6 destroyers (2 refitting), 14 armed auxiliaries, 1 submarine, 28 mine sweeping trawlers, 19 ice breakers and auxiliaries in the White Sea. The British Force is 1 battleship, 3 light cruisers, 4 armed boarding steamers, 4 drifters, 29 armed trawlers and 3 boom defence vessels.
UNITED STATES NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.(a) Disposition of Forces.The United States Navy have in European Waters : 35 Destroyers (in&apos; 6 Divisions), with 2 Tenders, working from Queenstown, 15 armed yachts on the French side of the Channel 1 light cruiser, 4 gunboats and 2 small craft in the Mediterranean.They have 5 destroyers and 12 auxiliaries in the Azores, which it is proposed to develop as a naval base.   5 destroyers are on their way from China to the Mediterranean.In American Waters they have the Atlantic Fleet consisting of 30 battleships, 8 cruisers, 8 light cruisers, 2 armed merchant cruisers, a patrol force of 8 yachts and auxiliaries, 9 destroyers, 18 submarines, and a minelaying force of 2 light cruisers and 1 gunboat; 4 cruisers on the East Coast of South America, 1 cruiser and 5 submarines in the Panama Zone, 2 old battleships, 2 cruisers, 2 gunboats, and 8 submarines off the Pacific Coast.In Chinese Waters they have 3 cruisers, 3 gunboats, 3 river gunboats, and 9 submarines.(b) Warship Construction.There are building for the United States Navy 9 battleships, 5 battle cruisers, 7 scout cruisers, 135 destroyers, 12 mine sweepers, and a few auxiliaries. Two of the battleships, will probably not be pressed forward. It is hoped that all the destroyers will be finished next year, when a further big destroyer programme is contemplated. The mine sweepers, should be ready this year.(c) Anti-Submarine Measures.For anti-submarine work, a large number of 110-feet motor launches are on order,, about 30 of which should be now ready. Nets are being made and 4 cruisers fitted to carry and launch aircraft. No practical results are as yet reported by the Committee of Inventors concentrating on the destruction of, and protection of ships against, submarines. The coasts of the Gulf of Mexico are being examined for possible submarine bases.FRENCH SHIPBUILDING.The French are gradually adding to the numbers of their anti-submarine craft sloops&gt; patrol boats, yachts, and submarine chasers which have formed their main building programme ; 12 new Destroyers have recently been completed in Japan and mil shortly be taken over by French crews at Port Said.Naval Staff,13th September, 1917.

Position 50.28N. 1.20W.Aircraft.From the daily Air Reports: 21. Large &quot;America &quot; Seaplane 8669 sighted and dropped three bombs on an enemy submarine.22. A patrol of two seaplanes sighted an enemy submarine approximately 14 miles away in the vicinity of North Hinder. The submarine was fully blown with two men on the conning tower and was travelling north at about 14 knots. Seaplane 8689 dropped one 230-lb. bomb, which exploded just abaft the centre of the submarine in its starboard, side. The submarine listed heavily to port and lost way and disappeared by the stern in about a minute. Seaplane 8676 passed over the enemy just as he sank and dropped one 230-lb. bomb, which exploded in the centre of the swirl caused by the enemy&apos;s disappearance. No. 8689 dropped two more 230-lb. bombs, which exploded just ahead of the spot. All four bombs were dropped from 800 feet. Two men were still on the conning tower as the enemy disappeared, but although the seaplanes scouted the area for 15 minutes nothing could be seen.23. A seaplane sighted, an enemy submarine in 50.4N. 1.30W7., and dropped bombs, but he had actually submerged before this could be done. Further bombs were dropped later on.24. Airship C. 9 sighted an enemy submarine, which submerged before the machine could get over him.   Two bombs were dropped on his submerged position.25.
