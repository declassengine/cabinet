&apos;fJ!REPORT from the MINISTRY OF LABOUR on the LABOUR SITUATION &quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;&apos;\    for the ffeek ending September ICth.&apos; I   /in r    .&apos;If. .     ~         j.\ I.     STRIPSAh important strike of Ironmoulders on the Clyde commenbed on the 13th instant.   This trouble, (referred to in Section II of last week&apos;s report by error as existing among the Boilermakers), has been brewing for some little time and is the first really serious strike which has arisen out of the 3/- award, though at one time it appeared possible that this would be made the grievance for a national strike,A Central Emergency Committee has been established the leading spirit on which is Alexander Liddell of Glasgow, and while the strike lacks the official support of the two unions whose members are involved, the Central Ironmoulders Association and the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland, it is thought locally that the opinion of the executives is really favourable to the menfs claims. The voting in favour of ceasing Work was as usual not heavy, only 3,000 out of a membership of 10*000 voting and of these almost a third being against the proposal.At first about 2000 men were involved but the number has no# increased to 5000. and no doubt many more will be affected should the strike last much longer.   As the union funds are not available for strike pay it is not considered likely that the men will be able to hold out for any length of time, nor, with the exception of aid promised by the Clyde Workers Committee, is it known that any assistance is likely to be received from outside organisations.The 100 squads of rivetters at Messrs. BeardmoreVs, Dalmuir, who ceased work on September 7th owing to a dispute as to the date from which a wages award should date, returned to work on the 13th, though the point was decided against them.At Briton Ferry in Glamorganshire a strike involving over 1000 Bteelworkers is taking place.   The trouble arose out of a demand put forward by the electrical workers and fitters for the reinstatement of a foreman who nad&quot; oceh HTscircn^:ua, The matter has been taken up by the Steel Smelters&apos; Union.&quot;A strike of 100 shipwrights is proceeding at the Barry Docks. Tho dispute arose over a question of demarcation betv/een shipwrights and joiners, and the former, who by their action are holding up repair work on all the ships in the port, are ignoring un award of June last which decided that the work in dispute should be done by the joiners.Altogether sixteen stoppages are reported to have occurred in the Shipbuilding Industry.The coal-mining industry continues to be a fruitful ground for strikes and disputes.The Low Laithes Colliery (Yorkshire) is still idle, a meeting which was held during the v/eek having failed to bring about any agreement.In South Derbyshire there has been fresh trouble at the Cresley Colliery over the question of rates in abnormal places and some 1100 men have ceased work.In South Wales several strikes are in progress, the most important of which are at Gwaun - Cue - Gurwen in Glamorgan, where 1300 men are idle owing to a demand for the reinstitution of an old agreement in place of a Federation agreement, and at the Kenfig popery, Tondu,. where 000 men are -invo-lved&quot; owingrto&apos;a &apos;d&apos;Isp&apos;ute&quot;&quot; over the dismissal of two blacksmiths.   A-9tn outside organiss-ci &gt;ns.
(The strike at the -&quot;Jhitwick Colliery:in South Derbyshire has fceen settled.Owing to the intervention of the Ministry of Labour a oonfor enco between the representatives of Messrs. Pullars and their workpeople has been arranged for the 24th instant, under the presidency of the Duke of Atholl.    In the meanwhile the strikers, who number 1300, have returned to work.The number of workers affected by the strike of 400 overlookers in the Ulster Linen Industry, was over-estimated in last week&apos;s report.   It should be 12000, not 18000.   Both sides have expressed themselves ready to arbitrate, but the employer&apos;s refuse the arbitrator appointed by the Ministry of Labour..   The workmen are willing to return to work on condition that the arbitrator selected by the Ministry is allowed to act.   Efforts to secure an Arbitrator mutually agreed upon have not so far succeeded.A small strike of workers has taken place in a Loadon sausage factory owing to the objection of the female workers to being searched beiore leaving the building., and a more important otrike of garment workers at Leicester., Involving about 1000 v/orkers and being due to a demand for an extension to civil work of a war bonus granted for army work..
I 11 disputes.-The number of disputes which are at present in progress reflects a considerable degree of unrest in the TJorld of Labour.The Shipyard Labour Department report 124 oases ef dispute as having been under consideration during the week, but of these 43 have been successfully settled.   In the Glasgow area which is as usual more disturbed than the others the transition from &quot;time and a bit&quot; to piece work rates is still a fruitful cause of unrest.The fallowing dispute which has arisen in the Newcastle distriot is an excellent example ef the difficulties which arise oyer dilution.   Owing to the scarcity of steel fettlers a number of granite cutters wore sent from Aberdeen ta reinforce&apos; this class ef labour.   The steel fettlers were informed of this par ject beforehand and raised no objection, but when the men arrived and began work the Settlers&apos; Society handed in a general notioe for its members, though they admitted the necessity of additional labour.   Both the mon and the firm involved have applied for arbitration.In the coalmining industry a number of important disputes involving large numbers of men are reported.The sevoral threatened strikes notably in 3tafford and Durham ever demands fer inoreased wages will not take place immediately as the men have agreed to await the&quot; decision of the Ceal Ctntrollor on the general question of an advance in wages before taking further action.Ho improvement seems to have boon offected in the case of the South &apos;Jales Colliory Examiners (&quot;firemen&quot;) who are seeking an.advance in wases and recognition of the Trade Union.   This dispute which involves the general question as to the authority which has jurisdiction over the case is&apos;understood to be before tho &apos;Tar Cabinet.   -At Mansfield about 2000 minors arc threatening to down tools unless their price list is immediately revisei.In South v7ales the.strikers at the Gwauh Colliery (seo Section I) aro attempting to bring cut all the men in the anthraoito distriot in connection with their grievance^ but so fat do not appear to have met with much success.   At the Cynon and Oakwood Collieries, which for somo time have been very disturbed, and also at the Tormynydd Colliery a strike of all the men engaged is threatened owing to the fact that proceedings have been taken undor the Employers and Workmen&apos;s Act against a collier employed In the Cyhoii Mho.   About 12500 men will bo involved if the Strike takes place.The&apos; Scottish Colliery engihemcn have aooopted the doal Controller&apos;s offer of a war bonus of 1/3 per shift and havo iftttharawn th^ir notices.   This is a decision of greet importance as a strike on their part would have affooted all tho mines in Scotland.. &quot; &quot;  The #ar Office Contracts Department report nine oases of dispute, throe of WkiOfc commended during the week,   iiost of those urifse out of wages questions, and in one case a boycott of Government work has taken place, as; tho prices offered for the work arc regarded as too low.
The threatened strike of Yorkshire wo&apos;oloombers has beenaverted, the award.of the Arbitrators having been announced on the 16th, ana. having resulted in substantial increases of\ wages.   1 plan has been put forward by the employers for a 10v stoppage of machinery throughout the week, in order to meet the difficulty created by shortage of wool.   General approval of this proposal is expressed by the workers.No agreement has yet been reached between the London Master Bakers and their men.   The former are consulting the provincial Associations in regard to certain proposals whioh were put forward by the workers,   A   further oonforenoe is being held today, but it is feared that no agreement will be reached, as the National Association of Master Bakers and Confectioners decline to accept the men&apos;s proposals.An important dispute involving the tramway workers of nineteen different authorities has arisen in Lancashire and Cheshire.   The trouble is really a recrudescence of a dispute which arose early in the summer and has been on several occasions referred to in this report.   Tho Union has on bobalf of its members tendered 21 days* notice to each of the different authorities concerned.The Ministry of Munitions reports nine strikes (six of which have been settled) and eleven disputes (two of whioh have been settled).   The most important of the latter has arisen among the gas stokers of tho Stockport Corporation. P-hould a strike occur important munitions works ^vill be involved.
III.   DISTRICT REPORT.oniioa and the With the exception of a number of small andSouth  s&apos;t.     unimportant strikes the position is quiet.Report;:; on the activities of the Herald League indicate&quot; that the pacifist propaganda of that body is meeting with more success than has hitherto attended its efforts.   Organised opposition from the British Empire Union and the British Workers1 League appears to have failed on several occasions, though in the case of the vforkers Suffrage Union which has held a number of abortive meetings, it has achieved some measure of success.   The membership of the Herald Lea^ie is said to have increased remarkably during the past few months.&apos;he South West. The situation is &lt;,uiet, though some discontent isreported to exist among the electrical workers at the Plymouth dockyard owing to dilution and the importation of female workers.There is also a ^ood deal of dissatisfaction in certain quarters, due to the alleged lack of Labour representation on the.food control committees.   This complaint, however, has assumed national proportions and is bein^. dealt with by the Ministry of Footl.est Midlands. The position is at present normal, but unrestin various ruarters is reported.Tom Mann addressed a well-attended and very sympathetic meeting at Birmingham on Saturday.   In this centre the beer question is still a cause of grumbling, and the efforts of the Ministry of Food are meeting with hostile criticism.The Staffordshire miners have resolved to fall In with the appeal to remain at work made by the Central Executive, but at the same time have passed a strong resolution against the delays of the Coal Controller.The chief contre of unrest in this district is still the coal mining industry, in which several strikes have occurred.    The men are apparently prepared to push any grievance, and at a recent meeting of the Derbyshire Miners1 Council .it was suggested that a down tools policy should be cidopted in the event of the Governments continued refusal to alter the basis for the incidence of income tax.In the heavy woollen district of Yorkshire the movement for an additional war bonus is gaining ground and has received the approval of   Mr. Ben Turner, the Secretary of the Union concerned.   It is pointed out that the advances so far granted have meant an increase of only 30/o to 50/; on pre-war rates, and that wages ou.vht to be brought up to a point at which the increased cost of living can bo met.orkshire and ast Midlands
i   *&apos;JI    -teth Western* At Liverpool interest centres chiefly in the&quot; ~ Award which has just &quot;been issued in regard to theclaim advanced by the Boilermakers1 Society that an award of 4-/~ granted in January last in the Mersey district should not have been merged in the national award of April.   The arbitration, as was expected, v/ent against this claim, and as a result tbe men are very dissatisfied,   tfor the present they have decided not to cease work, but as there have been two strikes within the last three months the situation is one of some gravity.    It is intended to contest the legality of the award, which is only signed by one of the three arbitrators.   Meanwhile the opinion that there will be a big strike in October is freely expressed.It may be noted that reports of intended strikes of national significance in October have been received from various quarters.   It is not clear what the grievance is to be, though food prices and also the engineering award have both been suggested.In the Cotton industry a good deal of friction has necessarily been caused by the shortage of raw material and tho operations of the Control Board. The indications are, however, that the position is righting itsolf.There is still unrost among tramway workers and one important strike has taken place..At Barrow the housing question remains the chief centre of interest.   The report of the Commissioners on Unrest followed by enquiries made by various, northern newspapers seems to have stirred up local opinion to a considerable pitch of indignation^ and a delegation has been electod which Is to proceed to London in order to place the case before the Ministry of Munitions. *During,the week-end Xirkwood from Glasgow addressed three enthusiastic meetings at Barrow , at which he &lt;?ave accounts of his various adventures,    e claimed to have come off entirely successful in his encounters with Mr,. Lloyd George, Mr. Churchill and Sir W. Beardmore, and advised his hearers to strike suddenly and often in order to secure their demands.   It would not appear that the particularly generous treatment which Kirkwood has received has had any effect upon him.rth-Bastern. With the exception of unrest among workers in theshipyards the position is normal.Mies. The situation in South Wales is very much disturbed.Important strikes of ooalminers are threatened (see Section II),   There is also trouble in varying degrees of importance among Shipwrights, steelsmelters,, engineers, bakers and ^asv/orkerst sections of whom are all . threatening to oease work.Scotland. The chief centre of interest on the Clyde is thestrike of Ironmouldors (described in Section I).o  
;&apos;- There is also     good deal of unrest among drillersand rivetters, while in the engineering shops on the Clyde almost all the men have pledged themselves to support any action -hich the men in England may tai:e to enforce their denund for a 100&gt;,= advance on pre-war rates.jxi effort which was recently made to amalgamate the Clyde v/orkers&quot; Committee, the Provision,! &apos;Jorkers1 Committee, and the Industrial Workers of Great Britain failed,   at the close of a meeting of delegates which . was held on Saturday McManus expressed his intention of leaving the Clyde*   It is thought that he intends to resume his propaganda work in England.
17.   PREPS OPINIONS.h&apos;^dg Union The Labour Press is unanimous in expressing the~ ~ opinion that grave dangers of a split existed at the timo the Conference assembled, and the general tone is one of relief that serious difference ms averted.   It is pointed out that such a difference might well have arisen not only in respect of the Stockholm Resolution, but also in connection with the resolution on the rival claims of Craft and Industrial Unionism.     The importance of the progress towards closer connection with the Co-Operative movement is also generally recognised.     The success of Mr. Arthur Henderson1s oratorical effort, and the enthusiasm of its reception are everywhere described.With reference to tho Stockholm resolution the &quot;L e ice s ter ?i one or&quot; writes;-   &quot;The fact is that honest &quot;men on both sides have realised that their differenoes &quot;are being turned to the advantage of persons who wish &quot;nothing but harm to Labour:   and that unless Labour &quot;stands togetlier now, the whole future of its organisation &quot;may be in jeopardy.    Many actions of the British Black . &quot;Hundreds have counted on this weekJs congress- L..-. they &quot;have done their best with patriotic exhortations., with &quot;orders and decorations and even with hard cash,  to bring &quot;about a fatal division in the ranks....Every section has&quot;shown a manifest desire not.......... to do anything \vhich&quot;could divide the movement at this critical time&quot;.The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; says:-   &quot;The forces of &quot;capitalism and reaction alone had hopes of the Congress &quot;....The Trade Unionists of the country have taken up the&quot;challenge magnificently and for the first time- for nearly &quot;three years Labour again presents a united front to the &quot;enemy,........The spirit behind the gathering was one&quot;which has not been experienced at a Labour Conference &quot;since the Labour Party entered the Coalition.     Unitjr has&apos; &quot;again been obtained.&quot;On the debate between the Liners1 Federation and the Craft Union the sane journal writes:-    &quot;It was felt that &quot;the question of craft and industrial unionism would, if &quot;carried to a division, disrupt the Congress, and by a &quot;majority of 5 to 2 this problem was remitted for &quot;consideration to the Parliamentary Committee, as has been &quot;done in the similar case of the railway shops&quot;.The &quot;Herald&quot; on this point says:-   &quot;Even on these &quot;industrial issues wMch were raised, the obvious and the &quot;reasonable desire of the Congress was to avoid forcing &quot;an issue while the danger of division was go great and &quot;the forces so evenly matched.     Twice during the week was &quot;the problem of Craft versus Industry discussed and on &quot;both occasions there was a careful avoidance of any vote  v &quot;that might have forced the Parliamentary Coomittee to &quot;take action on either side.&quot;Mr. Arthur Henderson receives most attention at the hands of the &quot;Herald&quot; which specially quotes his statement that &quot;he spoke under some?/fcat the same circumstances as &quot;Mr. Gladstone,, in so far as h  had e position of greater &quot;freedom with less responsibility, and he was in that &quot;position because he had declined to desert the people wfco&quot;had sent him........2he Conference choored this&quot;statement&quot;wijdly^and for a moriont^ or two great enthusiasm prevailedT. .&quot;\&apos;-&apos;8v
9 ,| cr 04 JAs to this sentence of the speech the &quot;British Citizen aa&amp;-l Empire Worker&quot; remarks:-    &quot;What in the name of clarity&apos;&quot;and sincerity does this mean?    Does this mean that : &quot;Messrs. Hodge  Barnes, Roberts, Clyaes, &apos;Talsh and v!ardle-&quot;are recreant?    Kr, Henderson dared not say this*    Thef &quot;libel insinuative, however,, can be as deafly as the &quot;slander direct*    Mr. Henderson&apos;s speech ma delivered &quot;with great confidence and some truculenoe.&quot;Discussing the Stockholm vote &quot;Forward&quot; thinks that &quot;the Labour movement is tc oome all right.&quot;.   Within ii &quot;there is a steadily growing conviction that the party&quot;should leave the Government.......If it had pursued a&quot;more independent policy it would by this time have been &quot;in the position of becoming the Government as soon as  % &quot;liked. ~ It accepted offices and threw away the&quot;opportunity of forming its own Cabinet......The&quot;Government victory over Labour as regards Stockholm is &quot;only a Pyrrhic one&quot;.    Similarly the &quot;Cotton Faotory Times&quot;5-   &quot;The important aspect of the matter is that ^Labour has asserted and reasserted itself.    The &quot;Government, after snubbing the representative of Labour &quot;within the Cabinet, and then going out of its way to &quot;deny to its representatives the means to attend an &quot;international conference, is told that neither it, nor &quot;any other Government,..has any right to prevent aft &quot;expression of feeling-by the working classes, am that &quot;any euch attempt is an unwarrantable interference with &quot;the rights of its citizens.&quot;   ...lied&apos;Inter- The proceedings of this Conference are reported in a onal tprade member of daily papers, but have notably escaped oommeht [on Con- in the Labour press generally, with the exception of the fehoe. &quot;Cotton Faotory Times&quot; and the &quot;British Citizen. &amp; EmpireWorker&quot;.   &apos;        ~~-p and the        ,. Mr. George Lansbury has another article in the fernment&apos;.&apos;     &quot;Herald&quot; urging tho &quot;Demand for a Labour War Cabinet&quot;, . which v;as first made in that paper during the previous-week.    The article dwells on various instances of failure and mismanagement in diplomacy and. in the conduct of the War, and claims that a Labour Cabinet could not have done worse and might have done better.atioaal The statement of policy made by the Minister ofOQ National Service has been an the&apos;whole well received bySSJb        ^e dally proso.    Tho &quot;fec&amp;egter Gtiarotoi&quot; howevercriticizes the policy on the ground that l&amp;e whole of the alalms on man power should be brought within the purview o-f one Department, and points out that in the piwsent instance &quot;Labour, for the Ministry of Monitions is, &quot;excluded from his sacj&gt;e and r oruit*ng is to h  kept &quot;entirely separate for1 liabour&apos;Supp|.y......If his Department is to justify its rVrival, separation, be tween&apos; &quot;labour supply and rearultin^ mast above all things ho ^avoided.

&quot;is no doubt in the minds of our miners that the ship-I &quot;owning interest, the middlemen and our own foodJ &quot;producers in this country, are largely to blame for the! &quot;high prices of commodities.     Very strong feeling existsI &quot;against the Government for allowing the exploiters to1 &quot;make fortunes out of the necessities of the people.&quot;I There is considerable discontent, in very many districts,on the subject of the personnel of the Pood Control Committees, claims being made g-eneiv.lly for a reduction in the number of representatives of the trading- community and an increase in that of labour representatives*     The &quot;Labour header&quot; reports, that, in Dundee, the workers &quot;deputation!zed the Torn Council in support of a demand &quot;for the co-option of three Labour rex&gt;resentatives on the &quot;Committee, but beforehand took the precaution to create &quot;a condition of protest which is thus expressed;   &quot;That &quot;day several foundries and works had been laid idle&quot;. &quot;This protest had great influence on the minds of the &quot;council, who listened attentively to the deputation, and &quot;then added three Labour members to the Committee.&quot;ousing. The &quot;Coventry Herald&quot; advertized a complaint on the~~ subject of housing munition girls.     &quot;One of these&quot;problems was referred to in the Munitions Court on &quot;Tuesday, when a Trade Union representative made a &quot;protest against vhat he declared to be the false &quot;promises involved by  iris being brought to Coventry on &quot;the strength of promises of hi^h wages......Some grave&quot;though Urgent stories have reached us from time to time &quot;as tc the exorbitant charges levied by landladies who &quot;let rooms to working girls1&apos;.... The article :;oes on torefer to the failure of the municipal authorities   to deal with the problem.     &quot;The question of finding &quot;lodgings, for instance, has never been tackled on any &quot;broad scale&quot;.Enquiries made by this Ministry have elicited the fact that the complaint is a seriouo exaggeration and that conditions in Coventry are generally very satisfactory.The housing question is widely discussed in the  Press.     The &quot;Liverpool Post &amp; Mercury&quot; reports a meeting of the Sefton Sural Council&quot; at which the Surveyor, reporting on the accommodation for agrioultural labour, stated that &quot;any apparent lack of accommodation arose &quot;through the cottages in the district being let to &quot;labourers and others working in Liverpool, who wore not &quot;interested in the cultivation of the land&quot;,Tno &quot;Times&quot; reports a meeting at which the speaker placed the requirements of the country at &quot;300,OGG new &quot;houses tc replace those which are insanitary, 500,000 to &quot;overtake tho deficiency in building of the last seven &quot;years* and 700,000 to provide for the increase in &quot;population,&quot; a total of l| million tenements.&quot;Clarion&quot; has opened its columns to correspondence on tfeis subject and prints letters from G. H.&quot; Darbishire and C. H, Oldham (&quot;national Conference on Housing after tho war&quot;), both urging the importance and magnitude of tho problem..
The &quot;South Wales Pioneer17 publishes a report of a conference on Housing Reform at Haverfordwest, when serious allegations as to the sanitary condition of the houses in Pembrokeshire were made, and reports ofcsimilar meetings at Newcastle, Glasgow, Gateshead., Sunderland, Carlisle. Conway, Ayr, Perth and Liverpool&quot;, are contained in various papers of the week.The decision of the Ministry of Munitions to build an additional 1,000 houses at Barrow has been unanimously approved.The &quot;Herald&quot; writes:-    &quot;The month or six weekscates. &quot;within which Mr. Churchill hoped to abolish the leaving&quot;certificate is slipping by.    There is need for prompt aad &quot;decisive action if a great deal of unnecessary unrest is &quot;not to be stirred up  ... Though many Tribunals have &quot;relaxed their procedure and are granting allowances far &quot;more easily than before, the men will not stand a further &quot;postponement of the promises they have received.&quot;
Y. GgFSgAL REMARKS.,3i- The exposures of the Sukhomlinov trial have received a rTor   very hearty welcome from the Independent Labour Party which &quot;~   holds that, in definitely removing responsibility fromGermany, they vindicate the attitude of the Party towards the war, and the forces and personalities which caused it.   The Press is jubilant, and articles on the subject are prominent in the Labour Leader,the Bradford Pioneer and notably the Herald, which suggest that the true facts have now been obtained, notwithstanding the obstruction of uhe Censor and the misrepresentations of the Times, that tho Kaiserrs   innocence is established, that he was at one with Sir Edward Grey in his efforts to prevent the conflagration, that Russian deception alone involved France and consequently England in a war which these countries believed to be defensive in its natureThe apparent strength of the I.L.P, position is obvious. The guilt is shifted to the shoulders of autocratic Russia, with whom England was at the time on terms of closest intimacy, Tho violation of Belgian neutrality is neither mentioned nor sugjosted as a reason for England&apos;s participation in the war. Belgium is indeed entirely outside the I.L.P, picture.It cannot be doubted that in future the pacificist propaganda of the Party will he based largely on this &quot;proof&quot; of German innocenoe.   The proof has been critically examined and rejected in various quarters, notably in the Westminster Gazette.   It is open to doubt whether this fact will be advertized by the I.L.P, and kindred, organizations.At the Trade Union Congress comment was made on the action r3hip. of the Censorship in allowing criticism of the existingGovernment of Russia,   of a nature which would not have been permitted before the Revolution.. Justification for this Du;r;estion is afforded by the publication of a someuhat blatant article by Countess Torby in the Daily Telegraph   of 1st September, calling upon the Cossacks io come to the rescue of their country under the leadership of a hero in glitteringarmour &quot;.....with the spark of penius in his eye, who will lead&quot;with a firm hand the coach of freedom to its destiny,&quot;   The leading articles in the Times of 11th, 12th and 13th September, dealing with the Korniloff revolt, and clearly in sympathy with its objects and hostile to the policy of the Soviet, are also open to criticism from this point of view.   Their obvious bias is the more regrettable in that a belief exists not only in Russia, but in organized Labour communities in Great Britain, that British official circles are not in sympathy with the aspirations of Russia towards freedom, and with the position of the Provisional Government in its strugple against overwhelming difficulty.D.
