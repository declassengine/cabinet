r- a\:X Op orations,SECRET.&apos;&apos;pSromQ-O^-Sjnlril Barter, Russia. &gt;Te-H^---r&apos;C;.&apos;I^d.S., War Office.13th September 1917. 1.56 p.m.No.1251.This morning I had long conversation with Korniloff. He does not seem depressed.     Ho is awaiting the arrival of Alexoieff to-morrow; it will be of private nature.     Meanwhile Korniloff has suspended all further political action.     He considers that in view of serious menace of renewal of attacks against Jacobstat and at Chernovits as well as Minsk it would be not patriotic to hamper operations against common enemy. He states committees on S.W. front have arrested all leading General and Staff officers and he has demanded their immediate release and restoration tc command in tho interest of the country.     There was serious disorder in the northern army, one General officer and one senior Staff officer were killed and woundud by soldiers.     He is not in communication with Cossack divisions about Potrograd, but is trying to get communications by aeroplane.     He believed Cossack divisions were ready to march against the Bolshevists but were not willing to act against Government.     In any case they were too far to strike at opportune moment.     He states at celebrated conference (?with) Savenkoff here, Kerenski&apos;s envoy asked him urgently to send as much cavalry as possible preferably of the line to Petrograd to act against Bolshevists who were expected tc rise against Government on or about 10th instant.     He does not know yet-.-what terms Alexoieff made with the Government, ho only knows that Alexeioff took them from Korniloff programme. Korniloff read mo full record of negotiations between Alexeieff speaking for Government and himself.     The conversation took place over direct wire after reciprocal precautions (?) proving identity of accuser, Korniloff then declaring that he only217wanted
wanted country&apos;s good and if Alexeieff had Government&apos;s guarantee that necessary measures would be taken he would stand aside.       Korniloff also informed me that trouble is brewing against Government ~by Cossacks of the Don and Caucasus (?4th division or Army Reserve).     Korniloff is evidently very anxious that the Western powers should know (he) has throughout only been inspired by patriotism.       It may be assumed that further complications with Korniloff are at an end.    In my opinion, the several Ambassadors at Petrograd should make every effort in common interest to reconcile Kerensky and Korniloff or at least to obtain guarantee for Korniloff&apos;s personal safety.
