 (1).Copy of letter dated 13th September 1917 from the Secretary, War Cabinet,, to Sir A. Mond.Dear Sir Alfred Mond,The attention of the. War Cabinet was drawn this morning to articles which appeared in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; on August 27th and September 5th, on the subject of the proposed War Museum, from which it appears that the writer of the article must have been cognisant of details of the proposals recently discussed at the War Cabinet.   It was generally agreed that these articles, which amounted to a serious attempt to influence public opinion in favour of the proposals, on which considerable criticism had been expressed at the Cabinet, and which are still sub judioe by a special CCmniit&apos;tee appointed by the Cabinet, were improper and mischievous. (I was directed, therefore, to ask if you would be good enough to inquire into the matter on behalf of the War Cabinet, and would endeavour to ascertain how the leakage occurred.   The War Cabinet would he glad if you would report to them the results of your inquiries.Yours sincerely;(Sd) M.P  A. Hankey. I(IDCopy of letter from Sir. A. Mond to the Secretary, War Cabinet.H.M. Office of Works,. S.W. 18th September 1917.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,In reference to yours of the 13th September, I have carefully studied the articles in auestidh,. which appeared during my absence from the office on a short holiday.   I would like to point out that 80 far as I can ascertain there is no information disclosed in those articles which has lwj already appeared in the Press, both in the form of interviews with me, anil of communications sent but officially for some months past, and to which no objection has ever been taken*TheRn. WAR: CABINET.2084.NATIONALWAR MEMORIAL MUSEUM,  .PUBLICATION IN TEE PRESS OF ARTICLES gl TENS   . DETAlIiS OP PROPOSALS BEFORE THE CABINET;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Copy of correspondence between the Secretary, War Cabinet,. And Sir Alfred Mond.(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 222, Minute 12):.
The subject of the War Museum, ever since it was sanctioned by the Cabinet, has been the object of lively interest to the public and the Press, both in this country and abroad.   The Committee of the War Museum have considered it only right from time to time to make communications to the Press on the subject of its progress.    Such a policy is essential in view of the fact that it is of the highest importance for the success of the Museum, that it should secure the hearty co-operation both of H.M. Forces, and of the public, in order to induce them to present to it ob^&apos;dts of great interest which would otherwise be dispersed and lost.The article complained of in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of the 27th August, is only one of a series based on information supplied in the ordinary course of routine.   It is obvious that as the scope of the subject is limited, the information supplied to the press and to the Cabinet must necessarily coincide in many respect I might here refer to an article in the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; of the 21st June, which is almost identical with that in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of August 27th.I further wish to state that no confidential memoranda, pre-eentsd to the Cabinet, have been allowed to leave this office.   I must therefore take emphatic objection to the expression &quot;leakage17 which must imply that either I, or those associated with me, have, in some illegitimate manner allowed information of a confidential  character, to reach the Press.   I very much regret the expression of opinion, which seems to imply that an improper attempt has been made to influence public opinion on a subject still before a special Cabinet Committee.   There is no evidence whatsoever to support such an allegation, and livery strongly resent it.I cannot hold myself Responsible for the opinions of editors of newspapers on matter supplied to them in a perfectly legitimate way.   I may point out that there are suggestions In the article-of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of September 5th, which do not at allaccord with my own views.Yours faithfully, (3d) Alfred Mond.-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 20th September 1917.
