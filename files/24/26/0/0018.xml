SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,iffiEEKLY REPORT ON GREECE. XI.Department of Information.DGW/Oll.(12 September, 1917).Debates In the Chamber.Report X dealt with the Speech from the Throne and the initial meetings of the Greek Chamber in the beginning of August.     The debates which took place during the month from August 6 to September 3 when the Chamber adjourned for three weeks, are some of the most lively and most interesting in the history of modjern Greece. The fact that a certain freedom of speech is allowed, Tjfoich during th ! last eighteen months was an impossibility, and also that political principles and party feeling are more sharply defined among the deputies than ever before, has resulted in an increased keenness and bitterness in the debates extraordinary even in Greece. As it is impossible in a report of a few pages to deal with the many controversial subjects which have been hotly discussed, attention,can only be called to the questions of greatest importance. .Debates from August 6 to 25.The appointment of a Committee on August 6 to draw up a Reply to the Speech from the Throne at once revealed a fundamental divergence of view between the two parties.     Sis supporters of the Government and three of the Opposition were mppointod to the Committee, but the Opposition members immediately decided that it was perfectly impossible for them to agree with their Government colleagues as to the tenor of this reply.     They consequently decided to draw up a Minority Statement of their own.
In spite of censorship, on August 15 the Esperinon Neon Astipublished in full, though apparently without authorisation, theMinority Statement issued by the three Opposition deputiesappointed to the -Committee.   This will, however, be best consideredunder the debate on the reply.During these preliminary debates the Opposition concentratedits attacks on questions like the proclamation of martial law inAttica and Boeotia and the censorship of the press reports ofdebates.   Their speeches aroused the fury of various enthusiasticVenizelists who even resorted to physical violence in theirattempts to prevent them speaking.   Mr Venizelos himself regrettedthis violence and proclaimed the fact in his speech, but declared:(1) that in time of war the primary consideration was the interestsof the country as a whole, and   (2) that the press which had solditself to German propaganda must be carefully watched to preventany repetition;of this offence.   He went further: V-/A-&quot;I am a Liberal&quot;, he said, &quot;but you know that the dictatorship has already been offered to me on another occasion;    I did not accept it, but if you tell me to-day that I am becoming a dictator I answer you tlu-t so far as the necessities of war demand that dictatorial power should be concentrated in the hands of the Government I will seek this pover and will ask the Chamber to bestow it on me&quot;.-.The most prominent and audacious speakers on behalf of theOpposition have been their leader Mr Stratos himself, Mr Sokolis(Corfu), Mr Kavallieratos (Kephallinia), Mr Aryiros and ex-CaptainTscukalas (an independent and extreme Athenian deputy).Enthusiastic Veniaelist deputies have not hesitated to reply inan equally violent tone to the attacks on their chief, thoughthe Ministers themselves have been most moderate and reasonablein their replies.   Their moderation has not been imitated byVenizelist free-lances like Mr Melas, Mr Nakas and many others.Especially cn the question of the anti-Venizelist outrages on
December 2 last party feeling reached a climax and wholesale   .ft reprisals were&apos; demanded by various Venizelist speakers.. The most important statement on behalf of the Government was that by Mr Venizslos himself on August 6 explaining that though it was impossible at the moment to admit   the deputies of Northern Epirus to the Chamber, his refusal did not imply any abandonment   . of Greece&apos;s racial claims to Northern Epirus which he was sure the Peace Conference, in   conformity with the Allies&apos; declaration \ that they were fighting for the principle of nationality,  could not fail to endorse.     On August 9 the Minister of Finance, Mr Neghro-pondis, made the sensational announcement of the discovery on his part of the loans contracted by the Skouloudhis Government with Germany at the beginning of last y.ear,    (Accounts of this have already appeared in the English press).The announcement gave rise to a vigorous debate on August 16, when the action of the National Bank in acting as a medium for these loans without the author isatIon of anyone except Mr Skouloudhis himself and without the knowledge of the Chamber was severely criticised.     Mr Venizelos acknowledged the reason for these attacks, but declared that his Government must recognise the obligations contracted by the Bank. On August 14 another fierce debate took place over the partisan attitude of the Holy Synod under the old regime,  and severe punishment for the offending bishops was demanded by Venizelist deputies.   An ecclesiastical tribunal of 13 bishops-under the Metropolitan of Saloniki has been constituted to try the Metropolitan of Athens and the other bishops implicated in these intrigues.     For the rest the Opposition speakers have sought to make bad blood by attacking the expulsion by the French andI   Italian authorities of some of the inhabitants of Corfu, by complaining of the imprisonment of various Greeks in Mitilini, and by harping on the fact that the Allied Naval Controls have
not &quot;been withdrawn from the Aegean. .There have seldom been more than 200 (and generally fewer) deputies present at the. debates.   The Venizelist party numbers about 180;   on August 14 the press announced that 25 Macedonian deputies/ mainly Turks and Jews, have,  as good opportunists, joined the party;    in addition various Independent deputies like Mr Pop (who on August 10 abandoned the editorship of Athine) are now as a rule supporting him.   The Socialist party of two deputies are at one with the Venizelists in repudiating the old regime but would have likedtthe Revolution to have gone further in the way of a Republic.   This, indeed, appears to be the wish also of a very considerable section of the Liberal party.The Manifesto of the Opposition.The Minority Statement above mentioned is clearly written andon the whole moderately phrased.    It concentrates attention onfour points of attack on the Government.   (1) That the Venizelists/though only a part of the _ nation, have thrust themselves by force into power and that this &quot;does not correspond with the wish of the Greek people&quot;,(2)-That the intervention of two great Powers claiming the right to intervene in the internal affairs of an absolutely Sovereign State is.opposed to the clearly expressed feelings of the Greek nation and its conception of its sovereign rights.(3) That the convocation of the Chamber of June 1915, although it had been constitutionally dissolved by Royal Decree, is opposed to the Government&apos;s promise of an appeal to the sovereign people to revise the Constitution and is a clear violation of that Constitution.(4) The dismissal and trial of leading ecclesiastic and judicial officials is also unconstitutional and partisan.The document goes on to set forth the reasons why theOpposition deputies always supported a policy of neutrality, asit thinks this was necessary for Greece&apos;s welfare, but It declaresthat as a state of war has now been imposed on Greece it hopes
that the nation will accomplish its duty to the Fatherland, and ends:&quot;The Chamber prays that Greece will issue from the present stern crisis spiritually and materially intact and strong, guarding her present territorial integrity and accomplishing the fulfilment of her just national aspirations and, above all, recovering fully and absolutely her independence&quot;.The Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.The full reports of the Address in Reply in the Greek press are not yet to hand and comments on it must therefore be limited to such telegraphic reports as have been forwarded.   The debate was opened by Mr Stratos who attacked the convocation of the present Chamber as unconstitutional, declared that the Powers had no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Greece, argued that Greece had not been bound to intervene under the terms of the Serbian Treaty, and, above all, defended King Constantino&apos;s constitutional attitude during the past two years ;:7The other chief speaker was   Mr Bousios (formerly a member of the expelled deputy Ioannis Dhraghoumis1 party) who declared he did not recognise the legality of King Alexander&apos;s accession. Mr Rallis also spoke in defence of the old regime.   On the Government side the Ministers Repoulis (Interior) and Politis (Foreign Affairs) defended thd principles and policy of the revolution.     Mr Kaphandaris (editor of the former Venizelist Monthly Review) spoke on behalf&apos;of the Committee for drawing up the Address in Reply, accepting the Monarchical regime as a provisional arrangement, but favouring the eventual establishment of a Republic.   This appears to be the standpoint of the majority of the party.     Mr Venizelos himself is more cautious.   Once again in a great speech on   August 27 lasting eight hours (in which he reviewed his whole past policy) he pronounced in favour of the
retention of the-Monarchy, though with the reservation that this Monarchy must be clearly recognised as a &quot;crowned Republic&quot;. He expressed the hope that the National Assembly will endorse this policy.       (It becomes evident, then, that in spite of the fact that this Assembly is to be a Revisionist, not a Constituent body, it is not certain that the Venizelists as a whole will acquiesce in the continuance of the Monarchy).The Chamber voted the Address in Reply by 198 to 10. The Opposition as a whole were not present.The Bill to Impeach Ministers.On September 2 as a. corollary to the full endorsement of the Venizelist programme by the Chamber, a Bill was introduced for the impeachment of the Skouloudhis and Lambros Cabinets before a specially constituted tribunal oh the charge of imposing an absolutist regime on the country (Admiral Koundouriotis is, of course, excepted).     The members of the Ghounaris Government, with the exception of Mr Zoghraphos, were subsequently included among the accused.   When Parliament meets again it will receive the report of the Commission appointed to hear the charges and 7/111 then constitute a High Court to try the accused.     Proceedings were also instituted on different charges against Prince Ipsilandis, King Constantine&apos;s Master of the Horsed(who has, however, been provisionally released for the time being), and against the notorious anti-Venizelist agitator Mr Rouphos. VThe Food Question.There is     very great distress throughout the country owing   . to the scarcity and dearness of food.   It is, of course, an obvious handle for anti-Venizelist propaganda to insist that,
in spite of Greece&apos;s intervention in the war, the Entente Powers are not affording her adequate facilities for the import of food, and anti-Venizelists are careful to ignore or minimise such measures as the Powers have already taken to revictual Greece.   Mr Venizelos is, of course, anxious to put matters as soon as possible on a better footing, and has drawn the attention of the British Charge dfAffaires to the advisability of his being able to increase the bread ration from f tof lb.     The monthly quota of wheat required is 2,500 tons, and the present supply will only last till October 5. Apparently the Thessalian harvest has fallen short of expectations by about 25 per cent., as about 15 per cent, of the crop has already gone or is to go to the French armies in Macedonia, and the rest of it is to be left to the Thessalians themselves.   The hopes of the population of Central Greece of sharing in the crops are doomed to disappointment.Military Preparations . &apos;On August 4 a Royal Decree was published calling the 1916 and 1917 classes to the colours.     English newspaper reports state that the recruits are joining with genuine enthusiasm.     This is more likely to be the case with these younger classes than it would be if the classes lately disbanded, which had been affected by Royalist propaganda, were to be summoned to the colours at once.ft_0.c gnition of the Powers. .Two Socialist deputies, Mr Sidheris and Mr Kcuriel, on August 9 interpellated the Minister of Foreign Affairs as to whether or no the Russian Government was refusing recognition to the Greek Government pending the decision of the Greek National Assembly,  and also if any foreign Power were insisting on the retention of the Monarchy in Greece (Britain is presumably hinted at).     Mr Politis
made the evasive reply that if one of the Great Powers.had refused such recognition it would not imply any derogation of the sovereignty of the Greek people.   The second question he   declared it was Impossible to answer.   The question of the maintenance of the Monarchy is indeed bound to be a vexed one and will arouse considerable party feeling when the Revisionist Assembly meets.Epirus. Mutual distrust of the French and Italian authorities resulted in considerable delay in the evacuation of the occupied territories of Greece agreed on in August.     However, by September 4&apos; the French had evacuated Preveza and the Italians ; had begun the evacuation of Yannina.   According to telegraphic reports Yannina has now been completely evacuated and the Greek authorities have been reinstalled there      Mr Venizelos&apos;s statement on the subject of Northern Epirus has already been quoted in the&apos; beginning of this Report.   His point of view and apparently that of the Greek nation as a whole is that the postponement of the discussion is absolutely necessary, but that Greece has no intention of abandoning her claims, #iich she considers justified by racial and historical   reasons.12.9.17..
