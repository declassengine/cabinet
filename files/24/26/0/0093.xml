  nrY\ NINTH REPORT BY SEE BOARD OP TRAIE ON -/ IMPORTS AND INDUSTRY IN RELATION TOSHIPPING.   .September, 17 th.A Report has been prepared on Imports and Industry in relation to Shipping which&apos; shows the position up to the end of August.    the outstanding points seem to be:~.... .In August the tonnage of goods imported amounted to 3,383,000 tons    a decrease of 19% on August&apos; 1916. This decrease is. somewhat larger tW tho corresponding decreasoion 1916, i.e. 16$, that tdok place in July.    But, as against ,1913, - the decrease in August was the smaller of the.two,, namely 29$ as against $6$ in July.    In spite of the,heavy,shipping losses, the&apos;quantity of goods : imported over the four months May-August has exceeded the forecast made by Sir Alfred Watson and Mr.llderton, in their Report of May 2lst, by nearly 2,300,000 tons or over. 20$.    This great excess of fact over forecast has been made possible, by the withdrawal of shipping from permanent service abroad and from the service of Allies and Colonies, by the requisitioning and time-chartering of a substantial amount of vessels from trade involving longer voyages to the North Atlantic route; by an improvement in the loading of vessels, and by other means.In August the imports placed upon the restricted list were down by 577,000 tons or 54$ as against 1916, and by 75/5.as against 1913.    But the imports of unrestricted, goods, though down by 214,000 tons, or 7$, as&apos;against August 1916. were actually greater by z% than they had been in August 1913.
The most important among the restricted imports is soft wood other than pitprops.    Of this the percentage contraction on &quot;both 1916 and 1913 was considerably less than in July.    The imports budgeted for by the Timber Supplies Department for the year June 30th 1917 - _ June 30th 1918 was 850,000 tons, less 10$ for losses ~ 765,000 tons.    In July 142,000 tens came and in August 258,000 tons, making 400,000 tons in all.     This , is more than half the estimate for the whole year, and, therefore;, gives cause for satisfaction.    It must be remembered, however, that the 765,000 tons estimate cut things very fine and that the budget of which it formed a part left a large deficit that must he made good somehow.Among unrestricted goods the imports of grain and flour exceeded the corresponding imports in August 1916 by 114,000 tons or 15% - a substantial increase, though very much smaller than the increase which took place in July.    The decrease as compared with 1916 in the imports of ray/ cotton, namely 14$ was yery much less than in recent months.    The imports of flax showed the verysatisfactory increase as against 1916 of 53%      More than2 &quot; &apos;- of the imported flax required for 1917-8 has arrivedor is afloat;,  and although there is necessarily someanxiety as to the Russian situation, a serious position isnot at present anticipated.     In Mineral oils, especiallykerosene, the stocks in this country under the  .Control ofthe Pool Board are   still dangerously low.    The Kerosenestocks at Ocean Installations on August 31st were 34,000tons, less than one months consumption, but they had risento
to 50,000 tons on September 7th.For August, as for previous months, the reduction as against 1913 in tons of goods imported was much less than the reduction of tonnage entrances (with cargo); and the ratio was decidedly more favourable than in July. As against 1916 the improvement was considerably .greater than the small improvement recorded in June and July.In August, the entrances of British vessels, exclusive of certain special requisitioned vessels for which returns are available for the first time in June 1917, were 1,677,000 tons (i.e. 9% less than in August 1916). The position was thus considerably worse than in July (when British entrances were 4% greater than in 1916), but a little better than June.    British entrances from the North Atlantic route, which constitute about one-half of the whole, were 3% up in August 1917 as against August 1916.      Foreign entrances in August show a slightly greater contraction mi 1916 than they did in either July or June.     British clearances were 1,242,000 tons (i.e. 24% less than in August 1916).   This contraction is the largest yet shown during 1917.      Foreign clearances show a Tiithmr smaller contraction than in previous months.When foreign vessels are divided up into groups according to nationality, the most striking feature for August is the much smaller contraction on 1915 which the entrances- of United States vessels show as compared with any of the three previous months.
From the beginning of January to the end of August 1917 the gross tonnage of merchant shipping lost by enemy action, was, British 2,770,000 tons:   Allied 835,000 tons: Neutral 1,020,000c    In Augast as it July the proportionate loss of Neutral shipping was much smaller than it had been in former months.    Whereas prior to July neutral Losses had always exceeded Allied losses, in August they amounted to considerably less than half Allied losses.    This is partly accounted for by the development of the policy of requisitioning neutral vessels and of engaging them on time-charter in comparatively safe waters.During August the aggregate losses of British merchant vessels over 500 tons from all causes was 370,000 tons.    This is some 5,000 tons higher than the losses in July, but it is less than in June, May and April.     The &apos;gains&apos; in August amounted altogether to 198,000 tons, made up of 92,000 tons of completed British built vessels, 14,000 tons of vessels purchased from abroad, 35,000 tons of vessels transferred from foreign flags by requisition, 52,000 tons of vessels released from the Baltic and 5,000tons of prizes.    The net loss during August thus amounted to 171,000 tons, as against 186,000 in July.The Returns of the Ministry of Shipping make it-possible to compare the position at the end of July for all British steam merchant vessels over 1,600 tons with that at the end of December, 1916.     The Grand Total of the-Mercantile steam fleet had fallen by 1,553,000 tons:     and the total ready for use by no less than 2,213,000 tons or about 13^b.     This reduction of available tonnage had been distributed as follows tskm, from the service of the Armvand Navy/
tonsand Navy 244,000 tons or 7$:     from the Colonies 335.000/ or 29$:     from the Allies, 277,000 tons or 14%:   from permanent service abroad 313,000 tons or 22%:   from the general trade of the United Kingdom 1,020,000 tons or 16$:      The tonnage of oilers had been &quot;maintained at practically its   original level - in the   neighbourhood of 960,000 tons.    It will thus &quot;be seen that up to the end of July the largest proportionate withdrawals of tonnage had been from the service of the Colonies and permanent service abroad, and in a less degree from the service of Allies.     But the vessels available for the general trade   of the United Kingdom (which, of course, includes the main part of the- import of munitions) had also been   very seriously reduced.    During August the total of tonnage actually available for all uses has undergone a further  reduction of  about 205,000 tons.     It is plain that only a very vigorous programme of shipbuilding can prevent tho situation from becoming exceedingly dangerous in the near future.
