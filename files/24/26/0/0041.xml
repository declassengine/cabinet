Claims which had been settled by gratuity will bo taken up at a later stage.About 1,000 claims of various descriptions have boon received asking for consideration under tho new Schomo, and these will be dealt with as soon as details of the Scheme have been settlod.There will bo a certain ovor-lapping of ro-assessments under the Warrant of the 29th March last, and those necessitated by the now Scheme, but this cannot easily be avoided and generally speaking the first ro-assossmcnt will bo carried through to completion unless in-certain oases tho processes can be combined.5#   fortuities to Widows.   33,000 Authorities for payment of these grants in cases of doath on or aftor 1st July, 1916, notified bofore 4th April, 1917, have been sont to tho IssueOffice.
Office.   About 6,000 have still to be sent, but tho issuo in those cases will depend upon whether the Uar Office have       160 effieiaily presumed death, the men having been originally&quot;reported-as missing.   About 20,000 payments have been made by the Pension Issue Office,6*   L01^?J2 .^ El S-.-L.3*^J3B i&quot;   during tho week the Tribunal has given judgment in 8 cases, 5 of which were decided in favour and 3 against the men, 576 appeals have been notified up to date to the Tribunal;   p.f these only 26 had by September 12th been prepared for hearing and this formed the subject  f a complaint by the Tribunal en that dato.   A large proportion of the 576 appeals were however in matters in which the Tribunal had no iuriedietion; and in seme other of the cases information elicited as a result of the appeal haa enabled pensioner te bo granted without the need f^r the case coming to hearing.    It is anticipate that vory shortly the Tribunal will be supplied with a steady flow of wcrk.7*   P-Qtired pay tct Officers, etc ,   The Retired pay to officers was re-examined in 360 cases and in 28B increased rates were given the average increase being  30 a year.

The son+tish Committor   held its 3rd meeting oa the 8th instant in Edinburgh.   A copy of the report of the proceedings is given In Appendix VII.   It will be apparent that the Committee has already made substantial progress towards the provision of various institutions including a Home for Neurasthenics, four Annexes for Orthopaedic Treatment at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, and Aberdeen, and a Colony for the treatment of Epilepsy.   The Scottish Red Cross Society are giving most generous assistance towards the capital cost of the institutions proposed to be utilised.Notification of Tuberculosis. An Army Council Instruction (No.1363 1917) has beon issued setting forth the arrangements made for the notification on discharge of cases of Tuberculosis among un-lnsured as well as insured men to the National Health Insurance Commission, and for notification to the Local Government Board in the case of insured officers and nurses.    In future every case in which, Tuberculosis is diagnosed will thus be reported before the man&apos;s discharge and it will be stated on(1the notification whether or not residential treatment is considered!II necessary and trhether or not the man accepts the treatment.   The!eInstruction provides also for the granting of furlough to aIsoldier whose disoharge has been decided upon before his actualadmission to the Sanatorium.   A copy of the Army Council Instruction is given in Appendix VIII.10.   Tubercul&apos;. 3ls. Enquiry at Battersoa.   An investigation has recently been made at the instanco of the London War Pensions Committee by an officer of the Bromptor Hospital, into the conditions of discharged disabled men suffering from Tuberculosis in the Borough of Lambeth.   The report 3hows that there is need for moro effeotive provision and after-care of tho men on discharge from a Sanatorium.   It is evident that a number of menon
on leaving the institution return to conditions of living and of work entirely unsuitable to their complaint, and prejudicial to the maintenance of the improvement in their health which has been brought about by their Sanatorium treatment.   The Ministry have now suggested to the Local Government Boards of England, Scotland and Ireland, that there should be direct co-operation between local Medical Officers of Health and the Tuberculosis Officers on the one hand, and the Local War Pensions Committees on the other, with a view to getting the man to, continue as far aa possible such treatment as is necessary after leaving tne Sanatorium, and, if need be, to change the conditions of his wcrl) Complete evidence as to the subsequent medical history of cases which have once passed through Sanatoria is lacking, but such as is available tends to show that cases which have received residential treatment at an early stage of the disease suffer relapse in tho absence of effective after-care and treatment morcj frequently than need bo the case.II*   Tuberculosis Treatment of Advanced Cases,   Under the specia]j| arrangement made by the Ministry with the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the treatment at tho co3t of tho Ministry of soldiers suffering from advanced Tuberculosis, 26 men were in the hospitals of the Board on tho 12th instant. 121   Neurasthenic cases receiving Residential Treatment.   The weekly return now received from the Special Medical Board shows the following numbers of Neurasthenic cases receiving .treatment in the Home at Golders Green and under arrangements made in Farm Camps on the 11th instant:-In the Home at Golders Green      96At Witham Farm Colony 10.13.

Appendix X shows that schemes for Institutional Treatment of a general kind have been submitted by the Berkshire, Derbyshire and East Sussex Local Committees.15  Individual oases of Treatment. Appendix XI shows that in 35 cases Special sanction was given to treatment which was not oovored by general schemes sanctioned by the Ministry.Numbers under Treatment.   Appendix XII shows tho number &lt;*f men for whom treatment has been provided under arrangements mado or approved by the Ministry and to whom allowances under Article 6 of the Royal Y/arrant are payable.   Thore were 157 cases admitted for treatment during the week and 700 men wero undor treatment on Woduesday the 12th instant, as compared with 543 at the end of the previous woek.   The Table shows also the nature of the disablements for which treatment was required.The same Table gives the number ef discharged men in lunatic aeylume who have been admitted to tho benefit Of the special arrangement for &quot;Service Patients&quot; referred to in previous reports.   The total number of &quot;Service Patients&quot; on the 12th instant was 328.Training.17    Training Of Blind.   The question of the training of the partially blind has been the subject of a discussion with the Secretary of the National Library for the Blind of which a note is attached as Appendix XIII.18*   Training of Deaf.   A p^pcsal of Tho London War Pensions Committee for training deaf discharged men in Lip Reading has been sanctioned as part of their general scheme for training.   A class of men has been formed at the Fitzroy Lip reading Colleges II, Fitzroy Square and 12 men have already commenced work, and have shown considerable interest in the course.
19. Trade Advisory Committees.   Meetings of tho Trade Advisory Committees in the building, furniture and boot and shoe trades were held during the week ended 12th August.   A report of the proceedings is given in Appendix XIV.20. Training of interned men.   The training of men interned in Switzerland which was roferred to in paragraph 19 of last week&apos;s report has been carried so far that Instructors for the training of the men have been engaged and the first two will leave on Monday the 17th instant for Switzerland.21    Training as School Teachers. A scheme for the training of disabled men as school teachers has been framed by the Governing body of Aberystwyth University, which has received the approval of the Board of Education.   A copy of the scheme is given as Appendix XV.   It will be seen that the scheme covers a two years&apos; course and is designed for men who have had a reasonably good education in the first instance.   With the higher salary proposed to be offered by the Board of Education for elementary school teachers it is hoped that the scheme will be attractive.     Other universities namely, Liverpool, Birmingham, Goldsmith&apos;s College (New Cross) and Southampton College, have proposed similar schemes, now under consideration of the Board of Education.22,   General Schemes of Training.   Schemes have been submittedduring the week by the Committees of Worcester County andReading Borough.   They are set forth in Appendix XVI.23    Individual cases of Training.   Sanction was given duringthe week to training in the 39 individual cases, not includedin general schemes shown in Appendix XVII.   In 84 cases furtherinformation has been asked for or modification of the originalproposals suggested,   9 direct applications for training havebeen received at the Ministry and referred to Local Committees for enquiry.24.   Numbers under Tralnirg^   Appendix XVIII shows that 28 menwere admitted to training by Local Committees during the weekand
and that the total number reported as under training at the end of the week was 199.Organisation.25. Report? of Ij^pS&apos;Otorj3    Extracts from the reports of the Inspectors of Accounts arc contained in Appendix XIX.   A very-satisfactory report is made of tho work of the East Riding Committee.   Regulations aro strictly adhered to in Wigan.   In Nottingham the duties of sub-committees are well carried out but the central office requires reorganisation.   In the Soke of Peterborough disabled men are looked after with method. Tho Rutland County Committee are said to be not likely to   cause the Ministry anxiety.    In Kent some further co-ordination of the work of tho local Committee and its sub-committees would seem necessary.   The Inspector lays stress on the unwillingness to accept training on account of high wages at ammunition factories and fear of pensions being affected.26. Organisation at Chelsea.   Very numerous complaints as to delays occurring in the award of pensions t  soldiers and in the reply to letters in this matter, together with the rapid growth in the number of temporary allowances paid to mon awaiting award of pensions and the coming to light of a certain number of eases in which duplicate awards have beon made is necessitating an examination into tho organisation of and methods adopted in the branch of the Ministry at Chelsea.   In tho meantime it being evident that the main reasons fer delay in first issue are due to failure of Re core&quot; Offices to furnish to the Ministry the necessary documents.on which to assess a man&apos;s pension before he is discharged, the Minister of Pensions has suggested to the Secretary of State for far the desirabilityof adopting the Canadian plan of keeping a man on pay and his family on Separation Allowances until his pension has been *i^a&apos; f

Sir Arthur was sympathetic and promised to see Sir R. &apos; Hudson about tho matter.   Dr. Bond spoke of the difficulty of obtaining accommodation for paraplegics suffering in addition from epilepsy.   Ho instanced one particular case and the Committee authorised him to got this man and any similar cases placedin
in Institutions at tho maintenance scale for paraplegics.The question of the allotment of bods in tho various Institutions was discussed and it was decided to recommend that a Circular letter should be 3ent from the Ministry to tho various Local War Pensions Committees informing thorn that they are not to make arrangements for accommodation for Epiloptics but should forward the particulars on to the Ministry.It was recognised that the alloting should bo made by Dr. Bond only.

APPENDIX V!Report ..by Dr i_B^nd.j__13th ^ Ix..l .ll* USAccommodation in Ireland for dis charged ._sailors ajad^s^ldiera who are epileptic^I spent three days, on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd of this month, in Ireland, during which, besides discussing the matter fully with Lt. Colonel. V/.R, Dawson, R.A.M.C. (President of the Irish Special Medical 3oard-on Neurasthenia and Epilepsy) and Dr. John Luirsden I was able through the kindness of Sir William Byrne (The Under Secretary for Ireland) to acquire a good deal of information.   At his suggestion I also saw at the Irish Lcoal Government Board, Mr. Edmund Bourke, Mr. Charles O&apos;Connor and Dr, E. Cocy Eiggar,A3 far as I could ascertain not only is there no epileptic colony in Ireland analogies to these in this country which are on the footing&apos;of private charities, but no Poor-Lav: Body has provided a colony similar to that for example at Monyhull;   in fact there does not appear to be an institution anywhere in Ireland specially for epileptics, and this despite the fact that, although^epilepsy is probably much more infrequent generally in Ireland than i*n England, there is evidence of the existence of some 2,000 3ane epileptics in Ireland (including about 700 in Poor-Laar institutions) of whom about 1,200 were thought to be in need of provision.   These figures are taken from the Report of the Royal Commission published in 1908, and I am informed that it may be assumed that substantially the same tttate of affairs still prevails.The desirability of the prevision of a properly planned and organised colony (on the villa system) for epileptics in Ireland has for many years been admitted, and about fifteen years ago the Countess of Meath offered the sum of  5,000 towards the provision of such a Homo provided the maintenance of its patients could otherwise be guaranteed.   Failure in the latter respect seems to have caused tho project to be dropped and to be still the chief obstacle to any step; being taken to meet the want; for the Guardians fear t&quot;-at, however muchmore
.more desirable it would be for the epileptics themselves, the cost of their maintenance would be constantly higher in such a colony than scattered, as about one third of them are, in workhouses throughout the country.   While it is possible that the Countess&apos;s generosity has oTfing to the war been expended in other directions, it is net at all improbable that, if she knew the project would now be energetically pushed forward, she would renew her offer, but even assuming that fact, I estimate that, besides the cost of land, at the very least a further similar sum would be required in addition to the cost of equipment.The number 0f discharged sailors and soldiers for whom such accommodation will be wanted in Ireland is at present very difficult to gauge, but, from what1Col. Dawson told me, I estimate that the Committee would be safe in providing two villas each to contain 25 patients and the necessary administrative buildings; the extent of the latter would depend on how far those responsible in Ireland would like to anticipate tho nood of future additional villas,    I am not sure how far an Irish Committee has been constituted on lines similar to that in Scotland but I suggest that if Col, Dawson were a member of it, he could similarly to Col. Macphcrson in Scotland, render much help to our progress.Prom what the representatives of the Irish Local Government Board told me, I think that if a letter was now addressed to thorn on the subject that Department would be pleased to   institute energetic inquiry or to available sites sufficiently near Dublin to permit of adequate medical attention being secured.   They mentioned to me the possibility of a disused workhouse being available; but if the best ends arc to be attained I cannot recommend that course except, as is unlikely such a workhouse cero -,f modern type.Total number of epileptics in the United Kingdom requiring institutional treatment:-Mr. Hore
Mr. Hore y/rites me that this information has been asked by the Treasury.    It is extremely hard for me to estimate this until I am quite clear what .the wishes and policy of the Committee are likely to be.   By my attendance at Sir John Collie&apos;s Board in London, I am satisfied that the number which depends on the personal interview with the discharged man and believe that by far the majority of those for whom I have allotted and am just about to allot beds would have elected to potter about at home if not otherwise persuaded by some one who knows what colony life is and what are Its advantages, both ameliarative   and in securing regular employment after leaving the colony.Direct a op 11 ca ti oris by Local Fens ions Committees to the Colonies for vacancies for cases of epi1epsy: This is still going on and I have seme fear that when the new accommodation becomes available in a few weeks, there may be a desire to snap it up in a fashion not in accordance with the Committee&apos;s scheme of distribution,
EiJOINT   INSTITUTIONAL   COMMTTEE   for   SCOTLAND.ItMinutes or third Meeting held at the North British Hotel Edinburgh, on Oth September, 1917. Present*Sir .Arthur Griffith Boscawen, M.P. (Chairman)Sir George T. Beatson. (vice-Chairman)Col. J. Macpherson.Sir Chc.3. J. Cleland.Col. Scott Riddell.Col. David Wallace.Bailie Thomas Adams.Lady Baxter.Mr. R.H.N.

Mlchio* and the Secretary.The Minutes of last meeting held 11th August, 1917 were read, approved of, and signed.Nourasthenla.Bailie Adams reported that the Edinburgh Town Council h purchased Crai^end House for  13,500.     The Town Council proposed to lease or feu it to the Joint Institutional Coiimittee or the Joint Area Committee or to the Ministry as might be considered legally proper.     The lease or feu contract to be for five years but to have a condition that it can be broken at the end of three years.
The question as to the body most suitable to be the second part}   to the contract would be considered by the Ministry of pensions end the Joint Committee informed, but the Chairman pointed out that if the Ministry became the Lessee the Joint Aree Co. mittee v/ould be asked to act as the agent of the Ministry for the management of the property and that for this purpose they should appoint a Sub-Committee with perhaps one or two co-opted members who had experience in hospital management.     The house and grounds could be handed over at the latest by 28th Nov., but it may be given over earlier.Orthopaedic Annexes.Mr, Seller and Colonel Riddell reported that the Nrrthern Area Committee had arranged for an Orthopaedic Annex in Aberdeen near to Gordon College in an existing building and submitted a plan for certain alterations thereto.     Certain Equipments had been ordered for the building and a Matron engaged at So-o-0 a week.     The premises would be leased to the Ministry but no precise terms os to rent were stated.     The Red Cross Society would defray the rent (if any) and cost of the equipment.The Committee approved df the action of Mr. Sellar and Colonel Riddell and requested the Northern Area Committer to appoint a small Sub-Committee who Yfould manage the Institution as agents of the Ministry.L  dy Baxter reported that the Central Area Committee had trranged with the Dundee Infirmary for Electrical Treatment and for Dudhope House to be used as a Hostel for massage and a hut had been erected and the stables could be turned into curative workshops.     The Committee approved of the scheme except as regards the curative workshops the provision of which it was agreed to hold over.     Sir George Beatson was to ask the Rod Cross to agree to a Hostel and Annex.
South  astern.Bailie Adams reported that a portion of ground could be leased opposite the Tynecastle Technical schools and it was proposed to build a temporary Annex on this site where the men could obtain massage and electrical treatment and at the same time pursue their technical training in the schools. A Sub-Committee had visited and recommends it.     The Committee generally, approved of the scheme.Sir Chas. J. Cleland reported that premises could be got in St. George&apos;s Place, Glasgow, at a rent of  200 and the premises having only been seen yesterday the cost of fitting and equipment of same would be reported at next meeting.Convalescent Homes*Sir Chas. J* Cleland also brought up the question of Convalescent Homes and the Chairman said the Committee would consider the matter later on.Epilepsy*Bailie Adame and Sir George Beatson reported that Muiriston House was suitable for an Epileptic Colony.     The rent would be  200 and the stock thereon, if taken over  770.     A lease would have to be taken and it would have&apos; to be determined whether the , Ministry of Pensions or the Joint Area Committee or other body should be the lessees.     Colonel Macpherson reported that Dr. Bond had an interview with Quarrier&apos;s Homes Manager and they had agroed to take a certain number of serious cases.     The Committee was  c ask the Directors as to how many beds they could offer for acute cases.
Sir G. Beatson reported that he had considered with Arthur G. Boscawen the question of the funds to be provided by the Red Cross Society and he proposed at the meeting of the Finance Committee of that Society next week to suggest that provisionallya sum of  20,000 would be voted for Orthopaedic Annexes and  5000 for the Neurasthenia Homes.The Chairman proposed that Sir G. Beatson and himself be appointed Trustees for the purpose of receiving and disposing of such funds as the Red Cross Society might agree to transfer to the Joint Institutional Committee.     This was agreed to.Tuberculosis.Colonel Scott Riddell stated Mrs. Stewart Mackenzie, Seaforth was prepared to hand over a Sanatorium and to maintain it at Conon Bridge, Ross-shire.     The Chairman pointed out that the Minister of Pensions had recently made an arrangement with the Insurance Commissioners for effective curable cases by means of a grant and that the Ministry could not directly undertake treatment for these cases; they wore, however, prepared to provide for advanced incurable cases.     It was not the intention that this Institution should be used entirely for the latter class of cases and it was agreed, therefore, that the Ministry should communicate with the Scottish Insurance Commissioners and the Local Government Board with a view to a part of this Institution being used for curable cases of Tuberculosis among discharged men.The Committee instructed the Secretary to send Circular letters to Clerks of Local Committers and Secretaries of Joint Area Committees to the effect that w;:ere a Local Committee desired to obtain admission for a patient to either Moffat or Btrathpeffer the Clerk of the Local Committee should communicatewith
with the Secretary of the Joint Area Committee in whose district the Hospital was situated.     The Secretary of the Joint Area would thus centralise all dealings with the particular Hospital in his Area and accounts for maintenance of patients would be received by him from the hospital and transferred by him to the Local Committee concerned.It was agreed that a similar plan should be adopted with regard to other hospitals, provided by the Joint Institutional Committee.The Committee also instructed the Secretary to send Notices calling meetings to the Secretaries of the Joint Area Co.- mittees.The next meeting was fixed for Saturday, October 13th,1917.
APPtNUIX VIII[FOR OFFICIAL USB  ONLYJRMY COUNCIL INSTRUCTION.No. 1383 of 1917.War Office,5th September, 1917.;3   Discharge of officers, soldiers and nurses suffering &apos; from Tuberculosis (A.C.Is.  1912 and 2176 of 1916, etc.)t1, It has been decided that every invalided soldier, who was .:;red during his arnry service, as well as all insured officers, and soldiers are eligible, on leaving the army, to receive ,&apos;orium treatment through the National Insurance Commission, therefore necessary to adapt the procedure on discharge now iree to suit the new arrangements.:. The Local Government Board will deal in future only with (a) Uninsured officers.(b) Uninsured nurses..0.1846 will therefore only be used for these two groups.:. In every other case (including that of nurses who were laid before entering army service), A.F.O. 1835a will be filled in sent to the Insurance Commission. A supply is being sent to ;.C.-in-C. for distribution to military hospitals. The use of .0. 1835, which is no longer applicable, should be discontinued x&apos;diately the new form is received. . ,It will be seen that a distinction is made on A.F.O. 1835a be-: n those whose total income, including prospective pension, on in to civil life will be under and over  160 per annum. This inction does not in any way affect the eligibility of the persons :erned. The information is required only for the sake of scial adjustments between the National Insurance Commission1 the Ministry of Pensions.!. In consideration of the number of cases that have arisen re soldiers suffering from tuberculosis refuse sanatorium treat-&apos; .t when about to be discharged and afterwards apply for it, it&gt; 13184-1398)   16m  9/17   11 &amp; S   a. 17/1398
has been decided that A. P. 0. 1835a will be despatched bv O.C. military hospital to the National Health Insurance tommis in the case of every tuberculous soldier invalided from the ser The form will be sent 1it le it&apos;.( ila ! f(1) Whether residential treatment is considered necessarynot.(2) Whether residential treatment (where such treatmeij considered advisable) is accepted or refused,Attention is specially  directed  to  the follov points: ( ) Question 5 on the back of the A.F. 0. 1835a been modified to provide for the medical off indicating whether residential treatment is o: not essential. Care should be taken to de &quot; is&quot; or &quot; is not&quot; according to the med: officer&apos;s opinion on the case.yb) In cases Avhere residential treatment is &lt; considered essential, if the patient is willing accept it, the application at the foot of . 0. 1835a (Fart a) should be signed by hin. before. If the patient is not willing to ac&lt; it the form should be marked accordingly by completion of Fart b by the medical officer.5. It is understood that one of the grounds hitherto contri ing to the refusal to accept residential treatment is the withii ing of furlough pending transfer to a sanatorium. In fir furlough may be granted by the O.C. military hospital if the pat desires it and his medical condition justifies such action. Furli may be granted as soon after the date of approval of discharge the medical board as is considered expedient .by the O.C. hosp and may extend to the date of actual discharge, i.e., for the w period of 21 days as provided for in A.C.I. 2176 of 1916. patient should be informed that his admission to a sanatorium take place ordinarily on the 22nd day after his medical board, in staling the amount of furlough he would like to have, i understand that in no case will he be readmitted to the hos[. IrurF&apos;Ugh which does not cover the whole 21 days must bi arranged that the last day coincides with the date of dischargeif therefore a man desires e.g., 10 days&apos; furlough only   furlough will not begin until the 10th day before his discha from the army is due for completion.If furlough is given the man should be informed that he wii notified by the Insurance authorities at his furlough address of arrangements made for his admission to a civil institution i.e., sanatorium, date of admission, &amp;c.   The notification will be direct to the patient by the Insurance Committee.

The soldier will be furnished with a travelling- warrant by the z. hospital to his home, or other place at which he will spend ; furlough, where furlough is given, and he should be informed it his conveyance from his place of residence to the sanatorium lected for his treatment will be arranged without expense to nself.7. A.C.Is. 1912 and 2176 of 1916 are hereby amended, and .0. letter Eastern 7/357 (F. 2) of 1st August, 1915, as far as it lates to uninsured men, is accordingly cancelled.

TRAINING.Training of the Partially Blind,I. i IEnquiries having been received from tho Local Committees with reference to the training of partially blinded soldiers, the subject was discussed with Miss Austin, the Secretary of the National Library for the Blind at the Ministry on the 7th September, and it was suggested that satisfactory employment might perhaps be found for these men in testing or in gauging in Aeroplane ?/orkshops   1 Further enquiries are being made on&apos;this subject.   This work if otherwise suitable might be done by men of the labouring class.   It was also suggested that baskct making in factories would be a   suitable occupation.   This work has not been undertaken at St. Dunstaj as the men cannot carry it on in their oim homes.   A number of other | industries were discussed (poultry farming, diving, carpentry etc) but the only careers which appeared to promise satisfactory openings were (1) some forms of market gardening (e.g. fruit picking) for men accustomed to heavy manual work and (2) massage.Hiss Austin pointed out that it would bo well worth while for men with special sight dofects to receive a short course of instruction from someone acquainted with the blind6     For instance a .nan who can see vaguely but y/hc has net sufficient definition to read, can be taught BraillO-j   and mon who cannot see below the level of th3 face may be given special Instruction in walking, etc   There are many usoful hints which could be given to them in the course of two or three week3.   It was also suggested that better educated men who have previously beer engaged in clerical or similar occupations should be taught Braille shorthand and typewriting.   It is understood tbat Braille shorthand can be rocordod as quickly as ordinary shorthand, ard that blind typists are usually at least as accurate as sighted typists although they are handicapped by being unable to road what they have written., n  , It might do possiblo to arrange a special course at the Normal College for tho blind at Norwood, which would probably last from6 to 12 months.   If thoro wore any vacancies at Newington House. Edinburgh at the prosent timo it might be possible to arrange for some of tho partially blind to be trained there*
APPENDIX X I V192TRADE ADVISORY COMMITTEES. Report for Week Ending 12th September, 1917.BUI L D I l-I G.(a)   Carpentry and Joinery and ffoodwcrk.The Sub Committee for this branch of Building met in Manchester on Monday, September 10th and recommended that1) The period of training should be 52 weeks and that the employer should contribute 10/   the first six months, 15/- the 7th to 9th months and 20/- the 10th to 12 months. :2) That one day a week sho  ld be spent in a technical school during the training.3) That this period of training should be followed by an improvers period for two years during which no maintenance allowance should be paid by the Ministry of Pensions hut the wages should be fixed every three months by a Local Technical Advisory Committee.4) That at the end of three years a man should receive the trade union rate of wages.rl.B. This was agreed upon by the representatives of the Carpenters and Joiners present but they anticipated that it might be difficult to  et this car ..-led by their Executive Committee which hitherto has been very hostile to any suggestions for training, disabled men.(b1)     Masonry.An agreement almost on similar lines to that in Woodwork was agreed upon by the Trade Advisory Committee except that at the end of the year&apos;s period of training the employer guarantees a minimum wage of not less than 30/- a week.FURNITURE.The Trade Advisory Committee recommended that Local Technical Advisory Committees should be set ue in the 10 largest centres for the Furniture Industry? and approved a draft of the Regulations to be issued to Local Technical Advisory Committees.BOOT   A g D   SHO g   (Hand and Repairing).The Trade Advisory Committee recommended that Local Technical Advisory Committees should be set up in II large towns and also agreed as to a memorandum of Instructions to the Local Technical Advisory Committees.N.B.   In the case both of Furniture and Boot (Hand and Repairing) it is hoped that the Local Technical Advisory Committees will be set&apos; up as soon as the Kdnister of Pensions has declared these trades to be &quot;special trades &quot;  or the purpose of the Instructions to the Royal Warrant. 3   9 * *.7 *

TRAINING.Report on Schemes &amp;c. submitted and sanctioned during week ended 12th September, 1917.The Committee for th  County of Worcester have submitted proposals to train disabled men as Boot Repairers with firms in or near tho town of Bromsgro^,       They have been infovmod that tho conditions in which such training is ordinarily sanctioned are as follows:-(1) The period of training to be one year,(2) During the first 6 months tho employer to receivoa training foe of 5/-. per week payable at the end of tho 2nd, 4th and 6th months on the Local Committee being-satisfied that satisfactory instruction is being given.(3) During the 2nd 6 months tho employer to pay the man a minimum wage of 15/.- per week.It has been suggested that the Committee should discuss these terms with ths employers named, and should then consider in consultation with the Joint Advisory Committee by what arrangement the best Instruction for disabled men may be secured. Th y have eIso been informed that courses may be arranged with any reliable firms willing to accept the abovo conditions, but it is desirable that there should be no unnecessary duplication cf the training.Pending the receipt of a further report giving the particulars requested the question of sanction Is postponed.The Committ-ee for Reading have submitted proposals to trair disabled men in Boot and Shoe-making at Basildon Park,     They have been asked whether it is intended to train the men in hand made Boot making, as well as in Boot Repairing, and what facilities for braining exist at Basildon Park,      It has been pointed out to them tnat machine made boots, owing to their cheapness, have largely supersede: hand-made ones*      The machinery used in thfc former industry is of a highly specialised nature and thorough training could only be provided when the production is carried on on a larger scale.        On the other hand the hand-made boot to be marketable, must be a very hi^h class article requiring a high degree of skill to be acquired only by long training.      The Local Committee have been asked to considerlit3.! P?1^* and to au?mit ful1 Particulars, giving the nature and place of instruction, length of training and the fees payable in respect tnereof, with a statement as to the attitude of the Joint Advisory Committee in regard to the scheme.

APPENDIX XIX.197ORGANIZATION   BRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors for week ending 12th September 1917.NOTTINGHAM   LOCAL   COMMITTEE. .The work on behalf of wives and dependants of the sailors and soldiers whose homes are in Nottingham is delegated to 16 Sub-Committees.   At the outset this work was done by Sub-Committees of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families1 Association but to make the Committees more representative the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families&apos; Association were requested to add to their Sub-Committees members of various Local Government Authorities.   The work, as far as the Inspector could discover from the Minute Book, appears to be well &lt;rjme and the Local Committee keep a strict control.   There is a careful record.Lady Maud Rolleston, President and County Secretary, has taken her staff and is directing the war pensions work from her holiday residence in Sussex.The central office organization is bad but the Secretary readily assented to the Inspector&apos;s suggestions for improvement and criticism and accompanied him to the office of tho Leicester Local Committee to find out how best to completely re-organise his own office.   He is interested in the work and will at once set about re-organization. .PETERBOROUGH   LOCAL   COMMITTEE.At the request of the Local Committee the Inspector attended the Disablement Sub-Committee, the organization of which is good.    There is ample office accommodation and a separate room is set aside in which applicants are interviewed. The case-papers are well prepared and the Regulations observed. There is a good filing system and everything is easily accessible.There are 50 parishes in the Soke of Peterborough and the Committee has a representative in each.   These representatives have no authority except in very urgent cases as all applications are dealt with by the Committee.   The expenditure is small and is due to the strict observance of the Regulations and also owing to it being an agricultural country the&quot;wages and rents are very low.   Everything was highly satisfactory in the Accounts Section.-WIGAN   LOCAL   COMMITTEE.,The work is now carried out in one office instead of the three separate offices previously used and this is a much more satisfactory arrangement.   The Committee revise the grants at intervals and the investigation and visiting is
&gt;thorough.   Payments for rent allowances cover most of the expenditure under Part II of the Regulations, and so far as examined they were in order.   The Inspector reports that he considers the officials may be relied.on to carry out the Regulations striotly.EAST RIDING LOCAL COMMITTEE.   Buchroe Division.This Committee covers a large area reaching from York to the coast and includes Bridlington and Filey.    The Hon. Mrs.Willoughby is the Secretary and wes previously doing this work for the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families&apos; Association.   She has very capable representatives in the various townships and keeps in close touch with the whole area and reviews every grant made.Boarding house keepers have for the first time since the outbreak of war made a profit this summer and the revision of their cases is now being considered.   There are two grants being paid under Regulation 7 (2) without the sanction of the Statutory Committee but application will at once be made to the Special Grants Committee for permission to continue them. Grants are being paid under Regulation 7fa) which should really be dealt with under 7(l)fe), adjustment, however, will be made for the Quarterly Return.A different set of representatives for the cases of discharged men are appointed by the East Riding Local Committee.In conclusion the Inspector states that this is a good Committee with a most capable Secretary; the oases are well considered and no grants are rashly made.    The recovery of advances is very good.   The accounts are in good order with&apos; a complete and careful analysis of all items.RUTLAND LOCAL COMMITTEE.The cat.e work in this Committee is carefully performed. The aocounts are clearly and neatly kept and the expenditure is small.    Oakham and Uppingham are the only places of any size in the County but there are besides these 48 parishes, most of them very small villages.    There are 45 representatives of the Committee in these parishes to whom dependants turn to in any sort of difficulty.   The small expenditure is due to low wages and very normal rents.   The only industrial coneern in the County is a small boot and shoe factory at Oakham.    The workers on the land are mainly soldiers.Fifty disabled men are registered.    The Committee do not appear to have ever heard of Alternative Pensions and the Inspector enlightened them.   The Secretary was instructed to obtain conies of instructions for Alternative Pensions immediately to enable every member of the Committee to possess one.The Rutland Local Committee is a good, one and not likely to cause the Ministry of Pensions any anxiety.LEITH LOCAL COMMITTEE.The Inspector reports that this is a fairly well organised Committee and well administered and In the meantime calls for no special comment.
yKENT LOCAL COMMITTEE.Reporting on the Sub-divisions of the County of Kent the Inspector&apos;states that LooSi Committees in the County have not had it made sufficiently clear to them what their powers are under Part II of the Regulations and consequently some delays have arisen in assisting cases owing to these being sent unnecessarily to the Local Headquarters.    It is advisable that the Secretary of the Committee should notify all Subdivisions as to their actual po^er and also it is necessary that they should have an ample supply of forms issued for obtaining the necessary information before a case can be assisted.The form of Register for Disabled Men does not appear to have been issued to the Sub-divisions and several Hon. Secretaries have expressed their willingness to keep the same in preference to their own methods of recording cases.There is difficulty, it appears, over recoverable advances, particularly in tracing returns in the Island of Thanet.   Army Form 3080 is sent to the Regimental Paymaster in accordance with instructions and the Paymaster is requested to refund the amount advanced to the Local Treasurer at Maidstone. At the end of every month the Local Treasurer notifies the Sub-divisions of the amount he has received in respect of their division.   It is continually happening, however, that a person who has had an advance receives her arrears to date and goes to the Sub-divisional Treasurer and personally repays the loan . The Sub-divisional Treasurer immediately &quot;notifies the Regimental Paymaster of the repavment and requests the return of Army Form 3020 but a reply is often received that the Regimental Paymaster has already sent a cheque to the Local Treasurer, thereby necessitating a further payment to be made to the applicant, who otherwise would be overcharged twice for the amount advanced. The Inspector suggests that the&quot;Special Grants Committee shall instruct Local Treasurers to allow Divisional Treasurers to collect sums direct from Paymasters and that these Divisional Treasurers shall at the end of every month send a cheque to the Local Treasurer for all sums received on account of recoverable advances made during a particular month.Infringements of the Regulations were apparent at Margate but 285 cases were gone through and the necessary adjustments made.    The Local Committee has now given the question of organisation and-administration proper attention.As regards disabled sailors and soldiers, there is diffioulty in getting men to take up training o^ing to the high wages paid at munition factories and an impression^is still about that their pensions will be reduced on the completion of any.trai l e undertaken.   The Inspector suggests that some official notification should be issued whereby members of Local Committees can establish confidence in the men that this will not be the case.The Divisions inspected include Ramsgate, Margate JJover, Folkstone, Heme Bay, Sittingbourne, Shierness, Chatham, Dartford and Srith. &apos;
