15th September 19. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL SERVICE.TRANSPORT WORKERS BATTALIONS.I desire to refer to war Cabinet Paper No. G.T.1944 Transport Workers Battalions.The present demands for Man Power may conveniently be classified under two heads : -The demands for the fighting services are heavy and are not being met*   The powers of the Military Service Acts 1916 and 1917 are so hedged with statutory safeguards and with pledges that they practically cease to exist in the face of popular hostility.   Thic point Is well put in the War Cabinet Paper G.T. 1849 p.3.; and although it is traversed in the Report from the Ministry of Labour on the Labour Situation for the week ending 5th September, 1917, Part V. G.T. 1962, the experience of the Recruiting Department during the last twelve months substantially supports the conclusions of Professor Arnold.One of the causes contributory to the existing resistance to Recruiting is- the fact that many men, ostensibly withdrawn from civil life to meet the needs of the fighting services, are in reality withdrawn from their normal civil avocations merely to be returned to other civil work under the compelling powers of the Military Service and Army Acts.1,Demands for Men for the Fighting Services.2.Demands for Men for Civil Work.
I should view with regret any extension of this cause for resistance to recruiting.    I consider that the time is approaching when it will be necessary seriously to consider the whole policy with regard to the Military Industrial Compulsion, which has been started to meet various minor though acute needs, but which has a most important reaction on our powers of meeting major needs.V.&apos;ith regard to the provision of labour for civil work, there arc largo outstanding demands.    In my opinion tho fact that three Departments of State are relying in part on militarily compelled labour adds to the difficulty of meeting those demands, first by tho unfortunate effect the existence of some compelled labour has upon the minds of the Officials of the Department which requires the labour, in that they find it easier to ask for compelled labour than to find ordinary civil labour; second, bv the effect on labour itself; which has become extremely suspicious of Government handling of labour.   The second point has in the last few days been well exemplified by certain difficulties, which have had to be met by this Ministry of National Service in connection with Substitution Volunteers.A.C. 01 DDFS .N.S.R. 12.
