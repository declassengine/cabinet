S. M.11th September 1917.I have come to the conclusion that during jny absence from England a member.of the Ministry, without being seized of the statutory powers of the Secretary of State, or relieving me of my responsibility as Secretary of State for India, should be designated to represent me in Parliament, in the Ministry, and before the public as political chief of the Office.In accordance with this decision I propose to appoint Lord Islington in this behalf. Lord Islington will, therefore, be responsible for determining, with the advice of, and in co-operation with, the Under Secretary of State, how business should be brought before Council, for deciding how questions arising in Parliament should be dealt with, and for authorising the issue of orders in anticipation of Council&apos;s approval or of my approval, as the case may be, in matters- of great urgency and importance when it is not practicable to ascertain my views, or to refer to the War Cabinet or the Prime Minister, or to submit to the Council. &apos; &apos;.-.It will-be understood that during my absence important questions involving policy of a non-urgent character should await my return. But if a case occur which cannot so wait, it will ordinarily be possible to consult me by telegraph. I. do not anticipate that during my absence many occasions for doing this will arise, as the circumstances in which my visit to India is to be made preclude the raising by the Government of India of new questions of policy, save in altogether exceptional cases. In the event of any urgent question of Ministerial importance occuring in which, owing to the shortness of time, my views cannot be ascertained by cable, Lord Islington will have access to the War Cabinet and the Prime Minister. I have asked Lord Islington and Sir Thomas Holderness to keep me informed of matters here.              .   ; vThe usual arrangement will be made for the signing of despatches&apos; requiring the signature of one of His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretaries of State.   As regards the signature of Minutes of Council,.action should be taken in accordance with the precedent established on the occasion of Lord Crewe&apos;s visit to India in 1911-12.      .As regards the presidency of the Council, statute, provides that in the absence of the Secretary of State the Vice-President of Council should preside at the meetings, and this provision must be observed. But 1 would ask the Council to agree to-a modification of the custom (not based on statute) which precludes the Permanent and Parliamentary Under Secretaries from speaking at Council, and to allow these high officers of State the right of addressing Council (but of course not voting) on questions that come before it.I hope, if the Council approve, that this departure, though it arises from a temporary emergency, will be continued as a permanent arrangement. It has always seemed to me that the Under Secretaries of State, who are so closely concerned with the business of the Council in Committees, should have the right of speaking at the meetings when the final decisions are taken.    .
