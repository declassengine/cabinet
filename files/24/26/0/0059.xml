fffts DoctMfflT is. to Msjii^jftayyffi:SECHST Effi CABINETG.T,  0^ COAL  FOR  ITALYIn accordance with War Cabinet 231 Min. 10 a Conference was heK at 2, Whitehall Gardens on Friday, 14th September 1917 at 3.30 p.m.Lord Milner (Chairman) Lord Robert Cecil Sir Jo Maclay Sir Ea fy&apos;ldbore Smith Commander Henderson Mr. WoH.-, Be^eridge Mr* R.Eo JSnthovenMr. Thomas Jones, Secretary1. The Conference first considered the accuracy of the figures put forward in support of the demands for coal, arid were satisfied that so far. as they could be checked, they were substantially accurate..Some misunderstanding had arisen because of a failure always to distinguish &quot;between shipments and deliveries.   From Januaru to August 1917&apos; -che average shipments had been about 440,000 tons per month, and the average monthly deliveries about 400,000*    The difference was partly due to sinkings, and partly to deliveries being reckoned a bit later than shipments.    In August 690.COO tens had been shipped, giving an average for July arid August of 575.000 tons*    But in September it would not be possible to send more than 460,000 tons.Last year the Italians were obtaining close on one million tons a month.    In October 1916 they had a stock of 2,100,000 tons and a naval stock of 600,000 tons.   All that was now left was 460,000 tons naval stock.The monthly figure which it was desirable to aim at was 700 000 tons (inclusive of 60.000 to 70,000 tons from U.S.A.) In the Italian demand were included 200,000 tons for Munitions . and 240,000 tons for State RaLlwavso2. The Conference next considered the question of convoys for the ships taking coal to Italyotons of coal hn Italy* Liners coujd be sent with coal to Italy and could go en to Java e&lt;;gc. for Sugar,,Commander Henderson said that this&apos;additional number of targets, where there were so many already, might not make an appreciable addition to the losses from submarine attack. There had been,some promise of na-Val assistance from the Italians, but it had subsequently been withdrawn.
They did not want their coastal organization broken off.    Personally, he would prefer that various routes should be tried and some risk runiAs time was tonnage it would be a great advantage to shorten the time of the voyage to Italy*The Shipping Controller said that while the normal average time from&quot;Cardiff to Genoa was 11 days, it was now nearer 24 days.     It had been resolved not to disturb the present Archangel programme.    If the ships returned safely from Archangel^ it rnignt be possible to do better for Italy in October.    but there were so many competing pressures on the Ministry of Shipping that the position was constantly changing. The War Cabinet could of course decide to give priority to coal for Italy over our own requirements..Mr. Enthoven (Board of Trade) said that imports wore being vigorously cut down.    For June and July the restrictions were 600,000 tons.    The bulk of the savings nad been in timber and the Timber Controller was complaining of shortage and was anxious to bring timber from America*    Tonnage was also wanted for Leather.    Lord Bobort Cecil said the position in Italy was undoubtedly grave and he hoped that some way of helping her could be devised.    He would be giad to send a telegram urging the Italian Government to co-operate with us in aiiording tne necessary naval protection*, on the lines suggested by the Shipping Controller and Commander Henderson, viz:-   that if the Italian Government provided say 11 destroyers we would provide 15 to 20 liners at Gibraltar every 14 days or thereabouts, the liners to be escorted to Gsnoa and thence to Malta where the Admiralty would pick them up with the throug-h convoy, between Gibraltar and Port Said.The Conference agreed that a telegram approximately on these lines should be drawn up by Sir J. Maclay and Commander Henderson and submitted to the Foreign Office for transmission to Italy.        (Tne telegram as sent to the Foreign Office is given below).
DRAFT OF TELEGRAM SK*IT TO LORD R. CECIL 15th SEPTEMBER 1917, FOR TRANSMISSION TO THE ITALIAN GOVERB&amp;NT.Hope to make increase in. September shipments coal for Italy sufficient make average for August September approximately 600.000 tons.    This is exclusive of the shipments which are being made from America.    The extent of future supplies must depend upon whether Italy can give help in protecting forces.    We want Italian co-operation to enable us to give protection for through traific through Mediterranean.    For this purpose eleven Italian destroyers are needed to be worked as part of the anti-submarine forces under the control of the Commander in Chief.It is only by putting traffic through the Mediterranean that we can make a saving of tonnage to devote tti Italian coal supplies.It is also essential that as stated in recent negotiations, the few Italian vessels and neutrals chartered by Italy now taking coal to Blaye should be sent North Spain for ore.    Important that orders to this effect should be given at once especially as the next few weeks best weeks for loading ore before baa weather.    If above action taken by Italy Great Britain will do utmost to keep shipments from United Kingdom up to highest possible figure but undesirable to attempt exact statement as shipments largely depend on tonnage under Italian control and there are several uncertain factors in tonnage position which make precise estimate impracticable.
