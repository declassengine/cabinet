9 n h 7 Hi       -     ~;r7rr3X^:~~    War Office tfote on the complaint by the Lambeth GuardiansArmyof stoppage of a y allowances to persons in their charge.Official correspondence between the war Office and the Lambeth Guardians throws light on the genesis of these newspaper articles,Extract from letter from the Lambeth Guardians to the War Office dated 25th July, 1917, dealing with the withdrawal of any allowances from certain persons in their charge:-&quot;Secondly, the local rates have been called upon to bear a charge which rightly should be met by the Treasury, for had these amounts not been withdrawn from the Government allowance, the Guardians would have been in a position to claim their usual rates of payment in respect of the maintenance of these persons&quot; The \&lt;ar Office, in full agreement with the Admiralty and in communicat ion with the Local Government Board, has held, in accordance with a general Treasury principle, that the families of soldiers are entitled equally with other ratepayers to services at the expense of the Guardians in case of necessity, and has declined to continue Array allowances in order to enable the Guardians to recoup themselves from the recipients.   But it is not true that the fa;nilies are left without means in such cases.    V/here the mother goes into a rate-aided institution and the children remain outside, the mother&apos;s allowance from the state ceases, her allotment of 3/6 or 5/10 a week from her husband continues for her pergonal use, and the children are advanced to the &quot;motherless&quot; rate of allowance, which is sufficient for their maintenance under such conditions.At the same time, the SoldierB andSailors Family Association originally, subsequently th* Statutory Committee, and now the Local Pension Committees make such additional grants as may be necessary, on consideration of the circumstances of each case, to pay rent and other standing charges to keep the home together.     It has hitherto been universally agreed that such discretionary treatment founded on local knowledge, is what these cases require.The number of cases is considerable:   about 3, cOO in London alone during the past twelve months.In order to force an issue the Lambeth Guardians and one or two other Joards in London have now refused to notify the War Office of the admission of soldier&apos;s dependents to their institutions.
