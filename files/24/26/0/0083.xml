- &apos;0per at ions,SECRET&apos;,Prom :-   General Ballard, Roumania,ToC   I   Gr   S? jWar Office,16-9-1917.11,15 a.m.B.A. 716,I have had a conversation with Russian officers regarding the political situation.   The news here is very vague; it appears at the present moment, that Korniloff tried to establish himself as dictator, and has failed to do so.    There are rumours of a compromise.    In any case, however, the officers are inclined to predict that such a compromise will not be lasting, and that the Provisional Government will shortly conclude a separate peace.   Even the best officers are now so depressed that they are not disposed to struggle against it.     A month ago, they were all for continuing the war; they looked for a reaction against the Revolution, and expected to get a dictator, or at all events a strong Government.   The attempt has been made and has failed.   The Committees will be stronger than ever;  in some places they have actually taken executive command; in Jassy and probably elsewhere the telegraph offices are in the hands of Committees, who only pass such telegrams as they think fit; they refuse cipher telegrams from Russia.   With the approach of winter desertion will increase enormously and it is- openly &apos;discussed among the troops.   The Government will pander to the extreme party, and will he totally incapable of checking the desertion. The officers argue that in such circumstances it is useless to continue a war which can only end in disaster, and they begin themselves to hope for peace.    It is important to remember that, the press and telegraphs are in Kerensky1 s hands.   General Kaledin, the Cossack Chief, Is reported by the press to have been arrested by his own men; according to the press, the counter-revolution has proved a hopeless failure This may represent the military situation.The greatest importance must be attached to the enemy&apos;s movements in the course of the next fortnight.    At the present moment of indecision in the Russian ranks, they could obviously break through anywhere.   The Germans must be aware of the situation.      If they fall to profit by it, this points to one of two reasons; either they may themselves be so weak that they cannot spare the small forces requisite for the attempt or their organisation in Russia is so complete that they are waiting for still further interior (3 groups omitted) which will allow them to gain their ends.CONTINUATION FOLLOWS.
