The maximum retail cash price of regulation flour varies according to the quantity sold from 2\d. per lb. for less than half-a-quartern to 25s. per 140 lbs, . Local Food .Control Committees have&apos; limited powers to&apos;, vary these rates in exceptional circumstances. _      -The provisions relating to. the registration of flour factors and compensation to holders of existing stocks follow the &apos;lines indicated in previous Reports. .: ;       &quot;  &apos; &lt; ,(2) The Milk (Prices) Order, 191&apos;7, dated September 7, 1917,   regulates the price of milk for October and the five following months in fulfilment of the promise given that the price to the farmer for the winter&apos;s milk should not be less than Is. Sd. per imperial gallon.The price per imperial gallon to the producer is fixed at the rate of Is.bd.-for October, Is.- 7-|cL for November, and Is. 9&lt;i. thereafter until the endof March 1918, plus the net amount of&apos;railway charges actually incurred.Where milk is sold wholesale by a person other: than the producer , the maximum price per: imperial gallon of milk other than accommodation milk is fixed at Is. 8cL for October and 2s. for the five following    .- months, plus an additional rate of \d. per gallon where the milk is delivered to the buyer&apos;s premises.

(3) The Dried Fruits (Restriction) Order, 1917, dated -September 8, 1917,prohibits all dealings in specified dried fruits &apos; outside the United Kingdom except under licence. Goods actually in transit are not affected.The Order also requires all persons concerned to furnish a statesmen!;&apos;to the Ministry of Food before September 15 showing the quantities of fruit purchased but not shipped on September 8, and the quantity thereof sold or unsold.   The Order is not to be construed as prohibiting the insurance of any dried fruits.The dried fruits brought under control are : Valencias. . .    Dried prunes and plums.Muscatels. Dried   peaches   and   nec-Sultanas,   and    all    other    -     tarines.varieties of raisins. Dried apricots.Dates. Dried pears ; andDried currants. . Dried apples.Dried figs.(4) The Meat (Maximum Prices) Order (No. 2), 1917, dated September 11,1917, provides that there shall be added to subsection (b) of Clause 6 . of; the Principal Order the. words following :      &quot; or the maximum wholesale price for the carcase- as at the time of .....    &apos;  slaughter whichever shall be the less.&quot;......     The object of this&apos; amendment was to remove the impression ofcertain retail butchers who buy cattle alive that they could pay what prices they pleased for the cattle and base their retail charges on the sum paid notwithstanding that this was in excess of the maximum wholesale dead meat price prescribed by the principal Order.  Public Information.A Conference of Newspaper&apos; Representatives was held at Grosvenor House on September 11. Lord Rhondda explained the progress made in carrying out his announced determination to control the prices of the prime necessities of life in the interests of the consumer, and to-put a definite limit to the profits of dealers at every stage. He proceeded to state his reasons for thinking that the need of securing economy in food consumption was becoming increasingly urgent, and invited the co-operation,of those present and: of the newspapers which they controlled in the efforts which he was about.to make with this end in view. Before launching into any scheme of food economy propaganda, he proposed to determine, in consultation with Allied representatives, after making allowance for bad harvests, submarine losses and the like, what would be the amount which would have to be made good by our own efforts, whether such efforts were to be voluntary, or, in the last resort, enforced by compulsion.Lord Burnham expressed his appreciation of the information given, and assured Lord Rhondda that the Press would do everything in their power to forward the success of the contemplated campaign.At a special conference of the Shipbuilding, Engineering, and Allied Trades Federation held at Central Hall, Westminster, on September 13, Mr. Olynes outlined the scheme which Lord Rhondda Las in hand to reduce the prices of the primary articles of food, and gave figures to illustrate the progress already achieved. The conference was called by the Federation because of resolutions from branches which stated that workmen threatened to cease work as a protest against the high cost of food. After the explanation of Mr. Clynes several delegates expressed satisfaction with the statements made and a resolution of thanks was unanimously adopted.Lord Rhondda has taken the opportunity of stating again his- views on the subject of food control in a signed contribution to the first number of the National Food Journal, a paper which is to be issued on the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month by the Ministry of Food. It is felt that the success of the Food Controller&apos;s policy largely depends, upon the extent to which the public understand the principles underlying the numerous Orders which have been issued and upon their co-operation in carrying them into effect.
Control of Supplies and Prices.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. The difficulty of financing purchases by the Ministry of Food of bacon, hams, and lard in the United States and Canada has not yet been overcome. The present position is that importation from the United States on private account has been stopped, but the arrangements with the Treasury for the provision of funds needed to enable the Ministry of Food to take the place of the private importer are still incomplete. A shortage of bacon is threatened and the matter calls for settlement.Buyers in the United Kingdom who before the date of the proclamation prohibiting the import of bacon had made contracts for September shipment at fixed prices from the United States have been informed that licences will be given for the importation of the supplies contracted for. It is not anticipated that this will relieve the shortage to any appreciable extent.The trade is being consulted on the subject of fixing wholesale and retail prices of bacon, hams, and lard, and the accounts of wholesale firms are being examined by the Costing Department of the Ministry. The accounts of English, Scottish, and Irish curers are also being examined for the purpose of determining the cost of the processes of manufacture.Butter and Cheese. An Advisory Committee has been constituted this week to work out a scheme for the purchase of imported butter supplies and their fair distribution through the trade on the lines previously adopted for Government cheese.Butter is now very scarce, and in some cases unprocurable. There is no immediate prospect that this scarcity will be relieved. It may, indeed, become worse.A conference is being held with regard to checking the present consumption of cheese in order to have a reserve for the winter.Oils and Fats. The Crushers and Refiners Trade Advisory Committee has fixed a uniform refining cost, inclusive of profits, for practically all seeds and nuts. As a result of the deliberations between this Committee and a Committee representing cattle-food dealers a scheme has been worked out for the distribution of feeding-stuffs to farmers on a rationing basis throughout the coming winter.Negotiations for the purchase of the West African ground nuts and palm kernels have been continued.Efforts are being made to secure a greater supply of. castor seed from Ceylon to meet the increased requirements of the Air Services.Sugar. No losses of sugar cargoes have been incurred during the past week. Negotiations are proceeding through the Treasury and the London Exchange Committee for the purpose of arranging with the Amsterdam Banks for financing the purchase of sugar in Java. Owing to the exigencies of freight, the quantity to be purchased has, after consultation with the Shipping Controller, been limited to 150,000 tons ; but it is hoped that this quantity may be enlarged later if the Shipping Controller can find the necessary tonnage.The saving in price of buying in Java as compared with buying in Cuba may be put at 10Z. a ton for sugar for next year.Tea. The quantity of tea offered for sale by auction this week was very small. Apparently the June shipments, which were larger than those of May, have not yet begun to affect supplies.Some progress has been made in settling the preliminaries of the scheme for purchasing in India and Ceylon on account of Government all tea for export to the United Kingdom.This Ministry assented to the suggestion of the Board of Trade that imports of China tea in enemy vessels interned in China should be permitted._ Transport. At a Conference on Road Transport held on September 10, it was decided to invite Mr. Walter Long to support a scheme for compulsorily co-ordinating the commercial transport of wholesale and retail traders, especially with a view of pooling the petrol facilities of such traders for the common advantage in anticipation of a further early reduction of petrol supplies.Enforcement of Orders.Bread Order. There have been many prosecutions under the Bread Order and in some cases substantial fines have been imposed.   At the Thames Police Court on
the 5th instant, Jacob Cohen was fined 50Z. for selling bread under twelve hours&apos; old. Previous convictions were proved. In Birmingham several bakers were heavily fined for the same offence, one in a sum of 301., and two others in 101. each. On the other hand some Magistrates have inflicted very light fines. At the South Shields Police Court on the 6th instant, a baker was fined 5s., and in the Durham City Police Court, on the same day two bakers were fined Is. each. In these last two cases, the offences were selling bread under weight or of the wrong shape.Waste. At Dover, on the 7th instant, a lady owning fourteen dogs was fined hi. for using bread otherwise than for human consumption. At Scarborough, on the 5th instant, another lady was fined 5s. for feeding birds with bread.Orders dealing with Retail Prices. At the North Dublin Police Court, on the 4th instant, a grocer was fined hi. for selling oatmeal at Qd. a lb. At the Old Street Police Court, on the 6th instant, a grocer was fined 19s. and 21s. on two summonses for selling haricot and butter beans above the legal price. Several cases under the latter Order are reported from Newcastle where small fines were inflicted.A deputation from the Shop Assistants&apos; Association urged that some special means should be devised to bring to the notice of shop assistants a schedule of legal prices, and that each shop assistant should be required to sign a book admitting that they had studied the schedule. The deputation was informed that this Ministry has endeavoured, in dealing with cases of this sort, to fix the responsibility on the person actually responsible for the contravention, and that in several cases the managers of the shops have been fined in large sums while the assistant has been let off with a light penalty.Food (Conditions of Sale) Order, 1917. Several complaints have been received from various quarters to the effect that this Order was being widely disregarded in Ireland. It is of interest, therefore, to note that on the 4th instant, a grocer was fined hi. and her assistant Is., at the North Dublin Police Court, for refusing to sell sugar without tea.PART II. SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.While the stocks for September 1st on the whole are reassuring and the imports show an improvement on those of last week there are two unfavourable features : (1) Both the imports .and the stocks of bacon and ham are low.   The imports areless than those for the previous week by 35 per cent., and 38 per cent, lower than the average weekly for the 36 weeks of the current year. In the same way stocks of- the two together have fallen to the total of 29,400 tons, that is, three weeks&apos; consumption. Side by side with these figures must be put the decrease in the number of pigs as live stock, which marked a drop on. June 4th, 1917, of one-sixth as compared with the number returned on the same date in the preceding year.(2) The stocks of tea have fallen to a low level owing to the great decrease inimports which has been manifesting itself for some months. Until the tabulation of the tea stocks held in warehouses and in shops, now in progress, has been completed, it is not possible to state the position accurately ; but in view of the heavy demand for tea during the winter and by the Army, the statistics both of imports and of the stocks set out in Table E call for notice.Imports.The imports o  the principal foods and feeding skiffs (Table A) display a considerable improvement over those given last week, though when compared with those of the corresponding week in last year a decline of 19 per cent, has to be recorded, while an even greater decline is seen when the comparison is with the average weekly imports for the 36 weeks of the present year. On the other hand the import of rice is good, reaching the total of 13,525 tons. All the cereals show improvement, wheat and wheaten flour have risen 20 per cent., barley has risen 64 per cent., oats has nearly trebled, while maize is at any rate a couple of hundred tons to the good. In meat, that is beef and mutton, there is little change, but the two taken together are less in amount than the imports for the corresponding week of

There is also a probability that stocks on farms are underestimated at the end of the cereal year.A 31916 As compared with the previous week bacon and ham show a decline (35 per cent.), and there is a fall of 31 per cent, when the comparison is with the corresponding week &apos;of last year. A decline is true of margarine (56 per cent.), of lard where imports have fallen from 1,305 tons to 3G6 tons and in a less measure of butter. The importation of oil seeds is lower, while that of cake is higher.Stocks.Thou oh. it is not possible as yet to add the figures for the new harvest and so to take any comprehensive view of the past year, the stocks as given in Table E are by no means unsatisfactory when compared with those on August 1st. Wheat has risen* by 151,000 tons, and decrease in the stocks of other cereals, as barley and oats, is normal for the period of tile year. Beef aDd mutton, takeu together, exhibit some improvement (5 per cent.). On the other hand bacon and ham have fallen considerably the decline for the two together being 37 per cent, on comparison with the amounts in stock on August 1st. Butter has decreased, the fall in this case amounting to 25 per cent, and margarine has decreased by over 5 per cent. As has been pointed out already there is a considerable drop in the case of tea (nearly 27 per cent.) so far as the stock in bonded warehouses is concerned.Retail Prices.The general trend of retail prices during the month, as measured by the Board of Trade Index Numbers, has resumed its upward course, although it is little above the level of two months ago. In July and August of 1916 a similar movement occurred, the chief cause of the July fall in that case being the decrease in the prices of potatoes, meat, and cheese. In both years the August rise has been influenced by the higher prices of butter, cheese, eggs, and fish.Wholesale Prices.Changes in wholesale prices are chiefly of importance in the case of two groups of commodities. In meat the movement is towards a lower level, and this tendencv during the last week only carries on that which has been in progress during the month. Argentine mutton is an exception, as the price cited shows an increase of 7 per cent, as compared with that of the previous &lt;week and one of 8 per cent, when the comparison is made with that which ruled a month ago. In bacon the tendency indicated is upward, the movement, except in the case of Irish bacon, where there was a rise of 4 per cent, as compared with the price of a month ago, taking place in the increase in last week&apos;s prices over those of the previous week.The changes referred to are best seen in the following tabular statement.
