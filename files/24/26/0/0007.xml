&apos;iS    1 1Is1-9007 yA ^. .;.-mu&lt;un T */zCSECUIATTHTTO- THE KING AMD THE WAR-CABINET..I should ho glad of an immedievte decision of the War Cabinet on the annexed scheme for the proposed Interallied Military Counc:R. C.Lard Robert Cecil v&quot;:&apos;.   I submit:the scheme   sMvn...inithe attached table &apos;A&apos; for the organisation, of the   British Section.   It is important no doubt that the machinery be as simple as possible as well as being impressive from the point of view of Mr. McAdoo and the An erican public.C&apos;: (1)   Throe British Delegates would represent us at full meetings of the Council,   The names suggested would of course commend themselves to the American Government,The three Delegates-would present the whole British Programme to the Inter-Allied Council; this Pro gramme cover ing Munition s, Fo od and everything else required to be drawn from American sources for the prosecution of the War. except that in the matter; of finance, negotiations would also continue to be conducted directly between the Treasuries of the two countries.(2),   There would also be a Committee called the &quot;Priority Committee&quot; made up of delegates who ought to be men of high standing,from each of the Government Departments concerned in the operations of the Inter-Allied Council.   This Committee v/ould be of course the&quot; really important working machine in the whole organisation.The
&quot;&apos;-TheworK of the-Priority Committee would consist, Essentially, in arranging priority as between the demands of the great Supply Departments represented on-the Committee within the limitations prescribed by the cardinal factors of (a) finance; (b)tonnage,..This Committee would absorb the work of the existing- Interdepartmental Tonnage Priority Committee.The link between the Priority Committee and tho Delegates9 who are to     present the programme  worked out by the priority Committee to the whole Council, would be Mr. Runciman, who is both Chairman .of the Priority Committee and,one of the throe Delegates on the Council,:&quot; &gt;:&apos; :The Priority Committee..would require the services of a competent Secretary; and the same per son might act; as Secretary to tho three Britlsh Delegates when meeting as a Committee to rehearse their case before arguing it at the next Session of the Interallied Council.    .: The Priority Committee; could     probably de termine at its first meeting over how long a period, approximately, it would be possible to forecast a programme with reasonable accuracy.   It soems im* possible to make any such forecast until that Committee has met.   Tonnage and finance will probably continue to restrict the&apos;possibility of forecast to short periods..(Signed)&apos; C, J. Phillips,&apos;       8.9.17.
