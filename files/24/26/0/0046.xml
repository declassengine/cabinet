THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;.S,GOVERNMENT)SECRET G.T.2046WAR CABINET,SOLDIERS- AND SAILORS* PAY.Draft of Proposed Statement for Publication.The following decisions have been arrived at by the War Cabinet in respect of pay etc. for Seamen, Marines and Soldiers for the further period of the present War.They will come into operation for both Army and Navy as fromThe present decisions affect only the ranks below those of commissioned officers.   The War Cabinet has further instructed the Committee dealing with the matter to consider the question of the pay and allowances to commissioned officers, and to make whatever recommendations it may deem necessary upon the matter.(1) DECISIONS RESPECTING THE AlhlY.(a) The State will take over the whole of the compulsory allotment for the wife and Class B dependant and the whole of the existing allotment for the Class A dependent up to the 6d. and lOd. limit.     This concession will apply to all soldiers who belong to units whose depots are situated in the United Kingdom and who are paid at the rates laid down in the Royal Warrant for the pay, &amp;c.., of the Army,     it will not apply to men enlisted at special rates of pay, e.g., motor drivers at 6/- a day.(b) Proficiency pay to be payable after six months1 service instead of as now after two years&apos; service.(c) An Increase of pay of Id a day for each year&apos;s service to be granted to all soldiers to whom recommendation (a) applies..The extra payments under recommendations (b) and (c) will not be retrospective, but the service already given during the war will count for future payments,(d) Hospital stoppages to be abolished except where a man is responsible for the complaint for which he is being treated,(e) Pensions to be paid to time-expired men in addition to their pay.
{Z) DECISIONS RESPECTING- THE NAVY.-(a) The State to take over a portion of the allotment not exceeding 3/6d. in the case of allotments amounting to 5/-or more per. week, and in the case cf smaller allotments to dependants cither than wives, such lescer sum as will leave the man chargeable with D;/6d. per week. In the case of beys whose pay does not admit of an allotment in excess of 2/- a week, the State to take over 50 per cent of the&apos; allotment.(b) 3d. a day extra.to able seamen after three years (at present after six years), with corresponding increase in afloat allowance to marines.(c) Messing allowance at 7d (at present 5-|d).-(d) Abolition of hospital stoppages except where a man is responsible for the complaint for wnich he is being treated.(e) , Free kit (now free kit on entry) f ;(t)   Pensions to be paid to men who have completed time for pension and ase detained under Proclamation;   the same to be retrospective as from the.beginning of the war, minus, in each *ase, the value of the detained pay already reoelved.(g)   Improved pension for twenty-two years1 servioe.The total oost of these decisions, for both Army and Navy, will be approximately:-For the first year of their operation ...  50,500,000.For the seoond year of their operation...  54,000,000.It must be clearly understood that the Admiralty Orders and Army Orders and the Regulations made or to be   made, will alone be the documents that will be decisive as to any points that may arise in particular cases.   The Notes whioh follow are, however, generally explanatory where neoessary&apos; of the effect of the decisions.In comparing the pay of sailors and soldiers with the wages of oivilian workers, the distinction between the two classes should be borne in mind*   The whole cost of living in the case of the civilian has to be defrayed^ out Of his wages.   The sailor and soldier havjs nothing to pay for   &apos; rent, board or lodging;   and further, the soldier is clothed entirely, and the sailor to a certain extent, at the cost of the State.   Lien of both services, moreover, have the prospect of a life pension.   In case of permanent disablement in the service of the State all sailers and soldiers receive a pension for life on a not ungenerous scale, and in case of death attributable to service, precision is made for widows and ohildren substantially Leycnd what is made for civilian wage-earners by the -Workmen1s Compensation Act,The separation allowances now paid by the State to the wives or other dependants of service men have an important bearing on the subject.   These separation allowances, which in the case of the Navy have been instituted since the beginning of the war, are now on a much more generous scale, bqth as regards sailors and soldiers, than in 1914.   The increases made in the allowances for ohildren are shown in the following table:^

Army, by which the soldier is re^ li eyed of his allotment up to the extent. of 6d a day-&apos; for privates and cprpcrals, and ^.Od a day for sergeants and higher ranks. i^To this is&quot; sodded the decision .that /    These considerations, which form a substantial factor in the pay of the fighting foroes, are dealt with in the following question and answer in the House of Commons on the 9th August.Mr. Herbert Samuel aoked the Chancellor of the Exchequer what i3 now the average remuneration, of an infantry private without dependants, and of an infantry private with a wife and two children^ under the heads of pay, clothing, board, lodging, &amp;c, separation allowance paid by&apos; the State, if any, and grant from the Civil Liabilities Committee, and what is the total remuneration in each case.Mr. Macpherson;   The weekly value of the gtate*s expenditure on the infantry private corresponding to the., wage payable in civil life is approximately as follows:-&quot;
proficiency pay at the. rate [of 3d or 6d per day should be payable after six months&apos; service, instead of after two years   service, as at present;   and that there shall further be an increase in the soldiers&apos; pay of Id per day for each full year of service lilce the outbreak of war; thus providing a progressive increase in Say according to length of service.     It is also decided that time-exuired men shall have the option of drawing pension m addition to their pay, with retrospective effect during thewar.The decision as to proficiency pay will confer special benefit on the fighting troop* ana bring their pay more into line with that of the technical and departmental corps.It should be noted that the Is/- per day thus secured free of deduction to the private soldier does hot represent the total benefit he is intended to receive.     After six months he may receive 3d or 6d a day, and after each completed year of service an additional Id per day.     Therefore, even though a man remains a private for three years, his pay would be either ls/6d a day or ls/9d a day, according as he secured a second class or first class certificate of proficiency.The decisions as regards the Navy follow generally the Army decisions as to assistance by the State in the payment of allotnents to dependants, the shortening of the period of servioe qualifying for additional pay, payment of pensions to men who complete time during the war, and the abolition of hospital stoppages.     They differ from the Army proposals as regards increased messing allowance, replacement of kit, and the removal in certain cases of the maximum limit of pension, which at present   renders a man ineligible for increased pension even though his service is extended.. Further, as regards the Navy, hitherto men who have completed time fbr pension but who are detained under the Royal Proclamation have not received their pensions.     In consideration of the suspension of pension payment in these cases the men have received 2d a day detained pay* which has recently been made 2d a day for each year of detentloh up to a maximum of 8d per day during the fourth.year of detention.     It has been decided that pensions to these men shall be paid forthwith, and, of course, similarly to all men who may during the war be detained   +8frvi?? ^S^,*11! completion of time for pension;   and, lil 5?J,ait *? d? }?ed tha* Parent Bhall be retrospective to  hal?
