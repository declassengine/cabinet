Discouragement is too mild a term to apply to his state of mind in the midst of one of the most disastrous harvest seasons that has ever afflicted British agriculture, and which has come as a climax to the long series of perverse weather conditions which have dogged his efforts ever since the beginning of the year.An abnormal and snowbound winter prolonged until nearly Easter, a belated and hurried ploughing season followed by a withering drought in Kay, have been capped by a sodden and tempestuous August.     Under all these circumstances, accentuated by shortage of labour and other serious difficulties, the much harassed and abused farmer has succeeded not merely in wiping out the anticipated decrease from last year&apos;s acreage under corn and potatoes, but in adding nearly 400,000 acres to the total for England and Wales.     This is a great achievement, showing a dogged persistence and courage, which deserves, and should have received, the generous praise of the Press and the consuming public.   Instead of this the occasion has been taken, during the past week in particular, to launch a series of concerted and abusive attacks
on the whole agricultural community;   to accuse the farmer of &quot;profiteering&quot;, of lack of public spirit, and of unpatriotic greed if he ventures to express his inability to produce beef next year at prices which he maintains will entail an actual less. Whether his calculations are open t@ question or not does net affect the main point.     The vital need of the moment, in the interests of the whole community, is to greatly increase production and to stimulate the farmer to a new and maximum effort.   This is the moat critical season, the period at which the campaign for breaking up grasslands for next year&apos;s &quot;victory&quot; crops will be either won or lost, and in this campaign, as in all others, the moral is to the physical as at least two to one.The natural and insurmountable difficulties are grave enough as they stand;   the lateness of the harvest Is losing weeks of ploughing weather;   the Food Controller&apos;s programme of prices, whilst gratifying to the consuming public, is no more encouraging to the farmer than late blight to the potato grower, and reports from all parts of the country show that symptoms ef paralysis are hampering the efforts of the Agricultural Executive Committees to stimulate increased&quot; ploughing.     In this state of affairs the seeds of disaster lie, because time and opportunities lost now can never be recovered.Every consideration of national interest and common sense therefore points to the imperative need of encouraging and cheering the farmer, even if his moods cause a fine impatience to those whose knowledge of agriculture is confined to consuming Its fruits.     Nothing can alter the fact that the farmer lives and works in isolation;   that increased production depends mainly ugon his state of morale;   that he cannot be ordered &apos;over the top&quot; like a conscript in the trenches, and that nothing Is more easy than to create a spirit of cautious inactivity which is more baffling than passive resistance.This being the situation, and it would be difficult to
exasperate its present seriousness, it becomes a matter of vital urgency that the Cabinet should take some healing and public action to restore the farmer&apos;s morale   and to counteract the campaign of threats and denunciation which may enliven the silly season, but which, if continued unchecked&gt; must do irremediable injury to the Pood Production Programme.LOCAL ORGANISATION i Work of the Agricultural Executive Committees.The Executive Committees are engaged, in. examining the returns of the surveys which have been carried out in the great majority of counties with the object of scheduling grass land suitable for ploughingj and a large number of orders are being issued as well as many warning notices and directions in the case of farms which fire not being cultivated properly.For instance, in the county of Northampton the District Committees have recommended the breaking up of 17,471 acres, and up to the 1st inst., orders have been issued in respect of 9,130 acres.     In addition, 133 orders have been issued In respect of 4,905 acres requiring the occupiers to improve their cultivation.A very satisfactory report has been received as to the cultivation of 270 acres of land at Houghton and Wyton, of which the Huntingdonshire Committee took possession last Kay.   The land, most of which is glebe, consisted of poor grass rapidly becoming derelict and much of it was covered with bushes.   The hedges were 12 feet high, the ditches were choked and the drainage had become useless. The Committee obtained the services of German prisoners, who have cleared the bushes, cut the hedges and opened the ditches;   193 acre-s have been ploughed by a Caterpillar tractor, 126 acres cultivated twice by steam, and 103 acres mole drained. Under favourable conditions the Caterpillar tractor ploughed 15 acres a day.     At*3**
present two three-horse Government teams, in charge of two Metropolitan Policemen, are at work cross-ploughing, and-had done 19 acres in 7 days.   The whole of the land is getting into a satisfactory condition.Land for Aerodromes.A conference has taken place with the Military Authorities as to the requirements of land for aerodromes, and it has been arranged that in future the Inspecting Officers of the Royal Flying Corps will invite the Commissioners of this Department to be present when any suggested sites are being inspected.   It is hoped that by this means closer co-operation will be secured between the two Departments, thus time v/ill be saved and due consideration given to the interests of food production before any definite steps are taken.Determination of Tenancies.During the week two Orders have been made, authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming, in respect of 162 acres, and three Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 212 ac^res.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Vegetable Drying and Fruit Preserving.   Reports from Instructors indicate that the efforts made to popularise vegetable drying and other methods of preserving fruit and vegetables are meeting&apos;with success.As an example of the enthusiastic way in which this method of food preserving is being taken up, the case of a hospital in north-west London may be mentioned.   The hospital contains 90 beds, and sufficient vegetables and fruit have been dried and stored by the patients and staff to provide the hospital with supplies until next summer.Fruit Pulping.   The stations referred to in previous reports have continued their work. At Maidstone alone the total quantity of fruit pulped up to September 8th was 1,440 tons.
TECHNICAL DIVISION. Potash.   The potassium salts, about to be manufactured by the Government Factory, are being investigated with a view to ascertaining the effect of the impurities associated with them. Hitherto the potassium salts obtained from the source now being utilised have contained cyanides and sulpho-eyanides, the complete removal of which is costly and probably unnecessary. Experiments are now in hand to ascertain what degree of purification is required.Compound Manures.   The proposed Order fixing the prices of these manures has necessitated a more precise determination of the exact meaning of certain trade terms, especially the expression of &quot;dissolved shoddy&quot;.   Experiments have been started with the object of defining this material and characterising it as far as possible.Utilisation of Straw.   Experiments have been arranged at several centres to test the manurial value of straw.    In addition to the nitrogen and potash contained in the straw, there is reason to   believe that the non-nitrogeneous constituents may play a part in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen.   The investigation suggested is one of many which are being arranged to discover methods of using economically the expected surplus of straw in 1918. Ploughing up Grass Land.   An inspection has been made of a derelict grass farm In Essex, part of which has been ploughed by tractor and part cultivated by steam tackle.     here the steam cultivator has followed the tractor good work has been done and a seed bed will be obtained this autumn.    &apos;There, however, the land has been merely cultivated by steam it is doubtful if the-herbage will be killed in time to permit of autumn sowing.   The steam tackle only became available at the beginning of August, and it would have been better if the plough, instead of the cultivator, had been used.
Indigenous Seeds.      It has now been possible to arrange to sow about 2 acres with indigenous seed of cocksfoot collected in Devon and Wales for the purpose of building up a supply of the true Indigenous seeds.     Smaller plots will also be sown with Crested Dogstail and other indigenous grasses, and an acre plot will be sown with a mixturd consisting wholly of indigenous seed, and . compared to plots sown with the ordinary commercial seeds.LABOUR.Soldier Labour.     The weekly returns received from the Department&apos;s Commissioners show that during the last week some 1,114 skilled and 404 unskilled men arrived at the Distribution Centres, making a total of 24,569 men, skilled and unskilled so far released by the Army for the 1918 Programme.     This figure includes 17,000 unskilled men released for harvest work who are to remain on the land for the 1918 Programme.During the week 1,134 skilled and 1,074 unskilled men were sent out to farmers.     To date a total of 4,486 skilled men made available for the 1918 Programme have been sent out to farms. In addition, some 9,000 unskilled soldiers, mainly men made available for harvest work, have been sent out to farms during the past few weeks.During last week 212 men have been sent out in the various counties for training as tractor drivers, making 292 such men now in training.Horses.   Orders for the Issue of 184 additional horses have been sent to Remount Depots, making a total of 1,189 horses to date. Prisoners of War.     Three new schemes for the employment of prisoners of war have been sent to the War Office during the week. The total number of Agricultural Camps from which prisoners of war are being employed on agricultural work is now 28, comprising 2&gt;511 prisoners of war.     In addition, 668 prisoners are being employed on agricultural work from other working camps.   The number of aliens released for employment in agriculture is 1,100, making up the total
number of prisoners employed in agriculture to 4,279. Sale of Horses Order.   Reports from the District Commissioners.and other sources show that the Order is working smoothly in most cases, and now that the Department are themselves purchasing horses, much of the opposition has been removed.   Several cases of alleged evasion of the Order have been brought to the notioe of the Department, and are being investigated.     A farmer in North Wales, who sold a horse without a licence, has been fined  3, and the purchaser of the horse  10.Agriculture and Recruiting.     As a result of further negotiations with the War Office, an agreement has been arrived at, which will have the effect of ensuring that men engaged in the production of fruit primarily for jam (in which description luxury fruit such as grapes, peaches, etc. are not of course Included) will not be called up for service with the Colours, except with the consent of the County; Agriculturai Executive Committees.The present position with regard to the release of individual soldiers, in order to return to maaage and direct the cultivation of farms, Is at present in a very unsatisfactory position.     Owing to the death of a tenant or to his serious illness it sometimes becomes necessary* in the interests of food production, to apply to the War Office for the release of a son or relative in order to manage the farm.     Since the 14th of June last, 179 applications have been made to the War Office for the release of men to manage farms and of these 152 have been refused. It is believed that in many cases the sole reason for refusal is that the man is in category &quot;A&quot;, but If this course is persisted in, grave injury to food production will be inflicted.   This Department have accordingly made representations to the War Office on the subject.Women&apos;s Branch. There is a decrease in the number of women accounted for this week from last week of 219, the total now recorded being
6,450.     It will be seen, however, that there are 60 more women actually employed on farm work.     The detailed returns ere as follows:-In Instruction Centres - 974In Training Bursaries - 403On Farm Work - 4,628 Waiting to be placedin Training Centres - 94 Waiting for employmentin Depots - 138 V/aiting in their ownHomes - 2136,450There is at present a considerable demand for potato pickers, who are required to begin work very shortly.   Several counties are unable to find a sufficient number of women locally for this purpose, and will have to import workers from other parts of the country.The supply and demand for agricultural work is, in most parts of England, fairly equal.     A much greater number of women, if they had been available, could have been employed in forestry and haybaling, and efforts will be made to place, for the winter, in these.occupations as many women as possible who will be willing to resume farm work next year.     In this way a reserve of labour will be built up which should prove a most useful factor when workers are wanted in the early spring.An Increasing number of demands are being received for vromen who have had a more technical training than has so far been given in the emergency short course.   Employers write that, owing-to the want of suitable forewomen, they often cannot employ women labour and, in One or two cases, definite requests have been made to the Department,  asking that certain women, whom they have employe might be given some advanced Instruction during the winter, so that they could be usefully employed as under-bailiffs next spring. The need for this further training is becoming more pressing, and arrangements are now In hand for providing more advanced courses. It is intended that these courses should be given to educated women who will be immediately useful as Superintendents,-8-
MACHINERY AND IMPLEMENTS. Motor Tractors. 170 tractors have been consigned to Agricultural Executive Committees during the week.   In addition, 69 tractors are on offer to Committees, 57 to Scotland and 4 to Ireland.   105 Titan tractors will be available for allocation to Committees as soon as they have been assembled.   The total number of tractors received by this Department, including the 31 sent to Scotland and 14 to Ireland&gt; is now 1,510.Harness.   The rate at which harness is being obtained still keeps well ahead of the rate at which horses are being purchased by the Department, although the future provision of harness still gives cause for some anxiety.   In addition to the quantities for which contracts have been placed, the Department has acquired over 1,000 collars under the Army Council Order, most of which are in need of repair. The returns under the Order include about 2,000 additional collars and 6,500 pairs of names, but until these have been inspected it is not possible to say what proportion will be of use to the Department.SUPPLIES.Supplies Sub-Committees.   Representatives of the Department have interviewed a number of Supplies Sub-Committees recently.   Many of the Committees are now taking active steps with a view to making provision for their requirements, especially in the case of fertilisers.   Approved Agent3 have now been appointed in 17 counties, and a number of Committees in other counties have applications under consideration.Sulphate of Ammonia.   The quantity of Sulphate of Ammonia delivered for agricultural use in the three months, June, July and August, has reached .40,000 tons, as compared with a little over 9,000 tons in the same period last year.   As some 20,000 tons has been sold for delivery during the current month, the total quantity stored in country districts during the first four months of the season will reach
60,000 tons, as compared with the estimated quantity of 40,000 tons, which was considered the maximum likely to be taken up by dealers and farmers in this period.Superphosphate.   The quantity of rock phosphate received by makers during August was 35,000 tons, as compared with about 18,000 tons in the preceding month.   It is understood, however that the quantitie of rock in course of shipment are disappointing.   The output of superphosphate was nearly 27,000 tons, and the stock in hand at the end of the month about 70,000 tons, so that supplies are available to meet immediate requirements.Basic Slag.   There is a brisk demand for basic slag and a number of large orders have been placed for delivery in Ireland. Lime.   A large soap works is proposing to erect a drying plant to deal with waste carbonate of lime, which it is expected can be dried at the rate of 150 tons a v/eek.   This will be offered for sale at about 12/- per ton at the works.   As soon as this proposal assumes definite shape, the Department will do its utmost to push the sale through Agricultural Executive Committees. Seeds.   In view of the urgent necessity of securing a reliable seed supply for 1918, a scheme has been prepared for the control of the sale of seed, which will involve the establishment of an official testing station in this Department, and the issue of an Order making it compulsory for vendors of seeds to provide various particulars regarding the contents of any parcel y/hich is offered for sale.   The need for some measure of control has been recognised for a long time, and is more keenly felt at present than ever before.Seed Theat.   An endeavour to procure additional supplies of 1916 ?rheat has shown that stocks of this crop, suitable for seed, are practically exhausted.    Orders for the selected varieties of seed wheat of the 1917 crop are increasing in volume, but the demand is still comparatively small,
Seeds other than Cereals*     The question of providing transport facilities for consignments of seeds from America has been further advanced during the past week.   The American Embassy is now in possession of the details of the requirements of the firms who have made a return to the Department.Seed Potatoes*   Preliminary enquiries are being made regarding the arrangements for growing 1,000 acres of immune varieties of potatoes in Scotland for seed purposes, to be distributed to growers in scheduled areas in England and 7/ales in 1919.   A conference will shortly take place between representatives of this Department, the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, and the Department of Agriculture for Ireland, regarding the fixing of a maximum price for *seed&apos; of the 1917 crop.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P. President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
