ISIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC ~&quot; MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SEC R J T.Copy No. / /G.T. 2055. 17.9.17.0.1/120/345.Provision of additional Sea-transport for the movement of troops.1. As the War Cabinet are aware we may expect that the a enemy will make as great an effort as possible during the coming winter in the direction of Mesopotamia or Palestine or both.The reports received from our two Commanders-in-Chief satisfy me, for the present, that the forces 1hey have, when reinforced according to arrangements already made, will suffice to carry out the approved policy.     But there are so many uncertain factors in the case - e.g., condition of the Turkish Forces, developments of the Russian situation, and feasibility of extending the hostile communications - that it is quite conceivable we may have, a little later, to reinforce Mesopotamia and perhaps India, and for this sea-transport must of course be forthcoming.2. Last year we had shipping in the vicinity of Egypt permanently allotted for the conveyance of two divisions to India, but this has gradually been withdrawn and we now have none for this purpose, noirhave we sufficient to meet the normal demandsin the Mediterranean.     The Shipping Controller is, however, taking steps to provide a slightly more shipping for the latter.3. In order to be ready to meet possible requirementsin Mesopotamia and India during the next few months it is necessary that additional shipping should be allotted, or at any rate be made available within a week of the demand being put forward, for the conveyance from Mediterranean ports to Mesopotamia or to Egypt of two Divisions as quickly as they can be embarked and transported. Wor this purpose 27 additional ships would, I understand, be required.4. I have discussed the matter with the Shipping Controller and First Sea Lord.   The former states that it will take nine weeks before all the 27 ships can be made ready (which of itself shows the necessity for taking immediate preparatory steps), and he also represents that it will make a serious drain on other shipping needs.5. The First Sea Lord states that the naval escorts in the Mediterranean cannot undertake to do more than they are now doing, and that in view of this and of the drain made on our general shipping reqmirements, it would be desirable to allot only 14 ships,and then, when the contemplated move is made, to suspend, partly, the ordinary Mediterranean traffic so as to admit of the escorts being provided.6. On the other hand the Shipping Controller calculates that if only 14 additional ships are supplied at least a month wouldbe lost in completing the move of two Divisions to Basra as compared with holding in reserve 27 ships - that is a total period of probably not much less than 3 as against 2 months.   I gather tfiat the Shipping Controller feels that if the 27 ships are regarded as of vital importance, the risk is one that could be taken in view of recent satisfactory imports.
7       It is not practicable to enter into details now as to where the troops would eome from*   The essential thing is to provide shipping, for* as the v&gt;ar Cabinet will readily understand, It is quite impossible to meet the various eventualities ?faion may arise in the Bast during the cosing winter tanlees reasonably rapid and sufficient facilities exist for moving troops from om theatre to another*As tfce matter is one of great importance I submit it to the War Cabinet, ae they will the :na elves wish to hear the views of the $hipping Controller and first sea Lord 17/9/17.
