AIRCRAFT FOR HOME DEFENCE.I think it desirable to inform the War Cabinet of the progress made in the supply of aircraft for Home Defence.*,(KT. 1461 *  1.    In.the .1 at. Report of the Committee on Mr Organisa-tf.C.190/16v tion andHome Defence against Air Raids, approved by the War Cabinet on 19th July, 1917, the conclusion of paragraph 10 states that :*::; .v&apos;.V &quot;The completion and training of these threeadditional squadrons, successively, be pushed on [m rapidly as possible and that, in the meantime, the return of the first unit to yranee V&apos;.should;not be sanctioned until the air defence of London Is reasonably secure.M fr.C.224/14, 2.   Oh 27th August, the equipment of these threesquadrons having progressed, the War Cabinet authorised the return of No   46 squadron to Prance. SoA.yyO ./140.,    i. Cn feist July the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home forces, stated that he considered five dtay--flying fighting squadrons necessary for Home Defence, anj was . informed by-the Array Council in reply that when the thres squadrons authorised, by the War Cabinet were complete, the position would again be considered. . 4. .

(undon/65.   5*   On 23rd August, the Admiralty asked that &apos;they might cease to maintain the flights of Naval fighting aeroplanes stationed at Dover, Manstone and Yarmouth, as it was proved almost impossible, under present circumstances, to interoept, from these stations, hostile aeroplanes coming from Belgium*  &quot;before, they reached the coast;. such interception being the allotted duty of. the Royal Naval Air Service.6V    The Army Council, on 4th September, with the concurrence of the yield Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces^, agreed to the release of these flights when the three Home Defence fighting squadrons should have attained a strength of 20 aeroplanes each.   The strength of these squadrons i3 to-day 55 aeroplanes instead of 60.7. It should be possible, without unduly interfering with the programme for the various Expeditionary tforcea, to begin to allot machines for a fourth squadron, in Qctober, but the date of completion will depend on supply.8. Provided supply does not fail seriously, a fifth squadron could follow the fourth.,  .   (Sd.).W.R. ROBERTSON..    O.I .G.S.11.9.17.
