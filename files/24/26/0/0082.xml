rrs ftOCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY Of HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY\ 8 ; GOVERNMENT . )tgJS C RET. G.T. 2082..   . - WAR CABINET. &apos;&apos; ,   SUPREME WAR ORGANISATION.    . (Memorandum by General Smuts.)I promised the War Cabinet yesterday that I would write a memo, on what appears to me a grave defect in our war organisation, viz; the absence of an agency which would co-ordinate the plans and activities of the Navy, War, and Air Departments and regulate priorities in their.numerous competing claims and demands.   The enormous expansion of our war effort and the great strain with which our war machine is working tend more and more to reveal shortcomings in our organisation; of these the gravest to my mind is the absence of a supreme co-ordinating and directing authority..There is such a fundamental unity and collaboration involved in all military operations that the ideal war organisation for this country is an Imperial General Staff supreme over the separate staffs of the Navy, Army and Air Services, regulating their joint plans and operations, eliminating fraction and dispersal of energy, and directing all their activities so&apos; as to secure the maximum of efficiency in our war operations.   We have&apos;no such supreme War Staff, nor is this the time to attempt to create one.   But some interim makeshift arrangement ought to be adopted in order to advise the War Cabinet .on the many pres-... sing questions which arise and which they have neither the time nor the information to decide without some such additional machinery.; &apos;I would therefore suggest the creation of an Advisory War Committee, consisting of,the chiefs of the Naval, General and Air Staffs and presided over by a member of the War Cabinet, whoae function it would be to advise the War Cabinet on all developments or operations in which the three Services or any two of them have to collaborate, and on all questions involving priority as to their respective requirements.   The committee would consist of the most trusted expert advisers of the Cabinet and have at their call all the technical advice which their or other Departments can command.   Any question of collaboration . or competitive requirements could therefore be worked out in advance and a sound technical opinion thereon properly matured before it is submitted to the final decision cf the War Cabinet. The committee would be in direct touch with the staffs of the * three Services and in consequence it would be fully conversant with their aims an|&amp; suggestions.   It would thus be in a position t t0 recommend to th% War Cabinet haw the full strength of the nation could be best used to secure victory in this war.   The personnel of such an Advisory War Committee may be a question for argument, not so, however, the urgent necessity for the committee itself.   But whatever membership is decided upon, I hope the oommittee will be kept as small as possible, for the sake both of efficiency and of arriving quickly at conclusions which are in many cases most pressing.
It is unnecessary for mo to argue the urgency and the necessity for suoh a body to assist the V/ar Cabinet, in their overwhelming taaJc.    I mention, however, some of the questions which have already arisen and press for immediate solution* and on which it is reaily difficult for the Cabinet to corns to a rapid decision with the materials at their disposal and the pressure of/great issues on their attention, other(a) Both the &quot;&amp;rmy &apos;and. the Air authorities press, most strongly for certain&apos;- far-reaching; .priorities in regard to our Air programme;    I have already, submitted a separate memo, on this most urgent question.(b) Tho Admiralty press equally strongly for the exeoution of an airship programme which is stated to be indispensablefor the future efficiency of our Navy.(o)   Both the previous claims appear to compete with each other, and in addition, if they are agreed to in vrholo or osrt, certain other claims, such as that of the Army for tanks, will have to be reconsidered.     The Cabinet are called upon to decide these questions, but they have neither the time nor the full materials before them on which to come to a well-matured decision.(d)   There are n imerous othor questions involving priorities which I need not mention, but which involve the Joint consideration of the throe Services in a spirit of compromise, which could only be Socurod by a committee such as I have suggested.    The tfar Cabinet will always have tho final say in case they or any of the claiming parties are dissatisfied with the findings of the committee.As regards all these and similar questions of priorities and competitive requirements of the three Services..the V;ar Committee seems to me simply the pendant to the Man-?0wer Committee.   The war priorities will be considered by the War Committee and the consequential labour priorities will be decidod by the i lan-?ower Committee.Should the V/ar Committee prove a success in practice, its scope could be extended.to other most important subjects to the great relief of the Cabinet.   Thus the question of our military programme for next Spring and Summer will soon come up for consideration.   The schemes already considered by tho &quot;Jar Policy Committee will havo to be reviewed in the lightof the results of our Flanders offensive which must now soon come to a close. Our future effort on the western front will have to be considered in relation to the other fronts and the possibilities of defeating our enemies there more easily than in the west.   All these questions require notonly caroful expert consideration, but consideration in the first instance by a body somewhat different from the war Policy Committee and including all our Tter Services, as tho result of their consideration and advice might and probably would involve joint operations or collaboration by all three Services.   If the War Committee v/ere a standing committee the minds of tho members could be continuously o one on tr a tod on these all-important matters, instead&apos; of being now and then directed tc them at the express request of the Cabinet. : They would have a standing instruction to elaborate for the information of the Cabinet our future campaign, schemes or sohemes of co-operation with our Allies.     The attention, of members of the &apos;-ar Cabinet would thus be set free :from the totalled consideration of schemes of strategy and could be devoted in greater measure and more usefully to those great issues .**iicb are rapidly pressing to the fore aa the war is noaring it  end.20tb September, 191?,/initialled)   J,C,S,
