6U. %tThte t)6immsnk 9$ tbt pmp^rtf ofHlj__gritannic fifiajesty&apos;a Government.)31; 2098^SUiUiAHY OP BLOCKADE IBFOK&amp;ASIOS14til - 20th Sept. 1917.In order to freeourselves from any engagementswhich may make it difficult to cooperate ?/ith the United States, we have decided to denounce the t\feole series of our agreements with Norwegian trade associations and individual firms, excepting only those with the Cotton Kills, the Cork Manufacturers and the Christiansand ITiekel Refinery.     These three agreements stand apart, as they do not bind us to grant export licences in favour of the contracting parties.     We anticipate that the agreements which we are denouncing my presently he revived, and we shall ask the Associations concerned to remain prepared to resume the centre! of the imports in which they are interested.We are likewise warning the Danish Associations that, so long as their Government refuses to comply witS the political demands of the United States, we cannot issue licences in their favour and shall ho obliged to impose drastic restrictions on their imports from overseas.        Under tho Anglo-Danish Agreement we are sntit. led to refuse export licences on tho ground that such  \ a course is necessitated by political considerations. W  are not entitled to interfere with direct imports from neutral countries, so far as these imports are destined for Banish home consumption.     We propose however to inform the Associations that, owing to the unexpected situation which has arisen, we cannot at present observe the Agreement in this particular.   We shall at the same time suggest that we should prefer the Agreement to be regarded rather as in suspense
than as finally annulled. 387If Norway anfl Denmark accede to the demands of the United States, and are in consequence permitted to resume the importation of normal supplies for home requirements, the machinery of the Associations will then he as aseful as it has ever been in the past.Our agreement with the H*0.T# remains formally intact though at the present- time it is practically inopere tive, except as regards Dutch colonial produce.     Any proposal to suspend the agreement would prob&amp;hly strengthen the hands of the pro-German and Rotterdam interests which are working for an economic treaty with Germany, and might even throw the colonial party into the pro-German camp.    The Dutch Government is extremely susceptible to German pressure, and no minister except r.Treub, the Minister of finance, seems inclined.to fight against those trading ana political interests in the Netherlands which are anxious to barter away economic independence in exchange for German coal ana salt and raw materials. M. Trenb and the colonial party welcome tho offer of a regular though, limited supply of British coal, which won-16 enable the Netherlands to bargain on bettor terms for Gorman coal.    But M. van Aalst informs us that the Dutch Government do not consider coal without grain a sufficient inducement to resist German pressure.   They demand a guarantee that they will be allowed to import into the Netherlands from the United states at least as much grain as will be carried for tho Belgian Relief Commission in Dutch ships*    Naturally we cannot give pledges as to the policy of the United States.     We are warning the Dutch Government, through M* van Aalst that, if they throw in their lot with Germany they mast be prepared to face such consequences as the detention
of the 3)uteh ships whioh srs now in American waters; and that, if they identify their interests with those of Germany, they may find themselves exposed to economic reprisals after the war.Meanwhile the eoal negotiations &quot;between the Netherlands and Germany have seen resumed*     Supplies of German coal are still witbeia, though nominally available at fantastic price But the Germans are prepared to supply 350,000 tone of eoal a month at the price of 36 florins a ton, and also to grant certain quantities of iron, steel, cement and salt, on condition of receiving Butch credits for sixteen million florins a month.      These credits, which are urgently required for German operations in Central America, are the primary advantage which the Germans hope to g in    But they also realise that, when the Motherlands have once become entirely dependent on German coal, the way will be clear for tho conclusion of more far-reaching agreements.The Swedish Delegates in Washington hove declined the offer of &apos;the Exports Board to buy the whole exportable surplus of Swedish iron ore, and have stated that Sweden would rather forego all imports from the United States.     The     Exports Board are disposed to consider that this reply makes any negotiation upon other points inadvisable.     They do not attach much importance to the question of Russian transitt since they think that the Swedish railways cannot transport a sufficient quantity of goods to make any appreciable Improvement in the Russian position.H.M. Government have decided to proceed with the scheme for purchasing the surplus of the Italian crops of oranges and lemons.     They Insist that the Italian Government shall participate in the losses which may result from the transaction*      It is hoped that tho
United States will also assume some liability*H M# Government hope to increase the September shipments of British coal to Italy, so as to bring the average for August and September up to 600.000 tons a month.        It would be easier to increase the present rate of supplies if tho Italians would give more effective assistance in patrolling the Western Kediterran-ean Switzerland.      Unless the Allies succeed in supplyingSwitzerland with specific quantities of oil-cake in the near future, the Swiss will be at liberty, under the terms of the Cattle Agreement, to increase their exports of cattle to the Central Powers.    We have asked the United States Exports Board to release oilcake for export to Switzerland;   but there is a shortage of oilcake in the United States, which will continue until the cotton-seed crop is available.      At present the Exports Board can only licence the export of 6,000 tons which were bought some time ago for Swiss account.United states.     The Exports Board have decided to insist upon the complete cessation of exports from Korway to Germany. They are about to open negotiations with the Stitch Mission, and it will be interesting to learn their attitude towards the Dutch demand for guaranteed supplies of American grain.The Trading with the Enemy Bill is expected to become lav? in the course of a few days. An amendment which was introduced by the Senate gives the President the power of prohibiting any imports into the United( States except under licence.   A Bureau of ImportRestrictions will be set up to exercise this power.
5.Argentine. A reliable authority estimates that the exportablesurplus of this year&apos;s maise orop is at most 700,000 tens* In 1916 the quantity exported was 3,000,000 tons*The United States Exports Board are refusing licences for the export of coal to the River Plate.   2his policy will naturally dispose the Plate grain houses ana the Argentine Government to entertain any reasonable proposals for the purchase of the Argentine grain surplus which may be submitted to them*     So long as we and the United States keep a tight control of bunker supplies, very little grain can be shipped from the Plate without our good will*     She purchase scheme which w  mentioned last week is under the consideration of the State Department at Washington*Submarine Blookj^e*        The following are the losses, due to enemy action, which were officially reported in the period September 14   SO inclusive,,     Smacks and trawlers are .omittedSteamships (500 tons gross &amp; over.)British .....   .   56,107 tons gross* Allied &amp; fiewtral.   24,77     tt      &quot;Sailing Vessels (100 tons gross &amp; over)Sritlsh .* . ..  *        5wXAllied &amp; Neutral.        514            &quot;Grand Total   81,914    &quot;      n Total British   55,688     &quot;      *H*W*G*3&gt;.War Trade Intelligence Department.
