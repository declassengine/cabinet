  &apos;y CIRCULATED TO        mm CA3IW,I venture to circulate to my Golleagues a Mote I sent to Mr. Balfour on August 25th    I have made some verbal alterations*r.cSeptember 18th, 1917,Dear Mr, Baliour:-You will remember that when you were in .America .you. sent me a telegram, to be communicated, to the Prime Minister, urging the appointment of Lord Grey as Ambassador in place of Sir Cecil Spring liice0 The offer was conveyed to Lord Grey solely out of deference to your recommendation, for the Cabinet were opposed to the proposal.   Later Lord Grey dis* &apos;cussed it with the. Prime Minister and decided to decline the appointment until at any rate hs had had an opportunity of discussing the matter with you on your return*   Since then no further  offer has been made to him,I venture to submit that the proposal which you then made has become far more urgently desirable now than it was even then.   There has been a steady stream of communications direct and indirect from the United States urging Lord Greyfs appointment. The two latest that I have come across were by Sir William Wiseman and Mr. Salter who, quite independently, arrived at this conclusion from their observation o  affairs out thereeSeveral
Several reasons are givww   In the first place it is said that Sir Cecil Spring Kice; is almost useless for the most important part of his work, namely, the improvement of the relations between the two countries* He does not appeal to Americans, official or unofficial, and they do not appeal to him.Then the Mission of Lord Northcliffe has not added to our diplomatic prestige.   This is not to criticise Lord Northcliffe personally, who has worked devotedly and with ability in a position of very great difficulty.   Nor is the Ambassador much,, if at all, to blame. But in the result the presence of the two men has added to the unsatisfactorines.s of the position,; and I am not. sure that Lord Heading&apos;s Mission, will not increase it still more.It is particularly regrettable that we should be diplomatically weak in Washington at the present time* Not only have we a mass of what may be called business negotiations going on there, which in the last resort can often only be carried through by the authority of the President, but it is clear that we are approaching a period in the war when we may at. any time have to consider serious peace proposals from one or more of our opponents. Recent telegrams from The Hague and other indications show that Austria is pining for peace. Rumours reach us of possible disturbances in Bulgaria* Enver and Talaat are said to bo quarrelling, and it is conceivable that tho lumbering Turkish machine may break down.   If serious peace propositions were made,      &apos;:&apos;-;J   the
the attitude of America would he all*important, and in this connection the attitude of America really means the attitude of President Wilson,   It cannot he too often insisted that, in Foreign Affairs, President Wilson is an autocrat; and, if we are to secure the complete co-operation of America during the war, and her friendship afterwards, we ought to have at Washington an Ambassador who will command the respect of the Presided and will be in sympathy with his personality.President Wilson might perhaps- be described as, in political opinion, a Gl.adstonian Liberal,   We ought therefore to have as Ambassador a man v/ho will understand that type of mind, and for that purpose Lord Grey would seem suitable.   But we want much more than that,   Mr. Salter said to me the other day that the qualities the Amorleans really admire are what they describe as the typical English qualities, that is to say: straightforwardness, disinterestedness, idealism, or,, if you like, the religious temperament.   In all these things Lord Grey is pre-, eminently stronger.   And he has one other exceptional advantage,namely that Colonel House is personally devoted to him, just as Lord Grey is very fond of Colonel House,Against all this it is said that Lord Grey is a Pacifist.   I worked with him very closely for about eighteen months, a.rrl I do not think the criticism zaccuratec   Lord Grey has an almost passionatehatred
hatred 01* war: an attitude of mind which id certainly not uncommon in Englishmen, and is consi stent*-with the highest courage and determination to pursue the war to the end.  My impression of Lord Grey is that he is prepared to face any sacrifice sooner, than make a peace which he would regard as inconclusive or dishonourable. . It is quite true that, in certain circumstances, he might he over persuaded to look favourably on a peace which really was unsatisfactory^ for Lord Grey, whether it be from modesty or from a certain Whig preference for  compromise, is,, perhaps,  . rather too persuadable. ..That &apos;was undoubtedly a blemish in a Foreign Minister, but it would be much less so in an Ambassador: for the business of an Ambassador is to carry out the policy of the Government at home, and Lord Grey1-8 conspicuous loyalty would ensure that he would do that to the utmost of his power..   Indeed, in an Ambassador at Washington,-private opinions are not of the first importance&gt; What is wanted is a man with a thorough knowledge of the European situation and recognition of British, interests, whose voice will be listened to at the White House.*Sir William Wiseman told me the other day that he understood from Colonel House that the President desired to work closely with us when it came to a discussion of&apos;terms of peace.   Indeed, he contemplated a state of things in which we should consult privatelyas
as to what terms of peace we propose to insist upon, and then zo into the Council and hack one another up* I do not know how far this may he true, hut it is certainly a possibility when one remembers that, though the American people are very largely foreign, both in origin and in modes of thought, their rulers are almost exclusively Anglo-Saxons, and share our political ideals* But there seems to me to be more at stake even than cooperation in tne terms of poace.The United states are e;itering upon an entirely fresh chapter of their history,,   For the first time they are talcing a part in i;itemotional European affairs; they will soon begin to realise what vast power they have; and, unless they are very different from any other nation that has ever existed they will wish to make use of that power    If they make use of it rightly, it may be of incalculable benefit to the human race: and by rightly I mean in accordance with our ideas of right and lustice,   There is undoubtedly a difference between the British and the Continental point of view in international mattersc   I will not attempt to describe the difference, but I know that you will agree in thiiiking that, where it exists, wc are right and the Continental nations are, speaking generally, wrong.   If America accepts our point of view in these matters, it will mean the dominance of that point of view in all international affairs*   I am convinced that there is no one who is a better exponentof
of what I will call the British point of view, both by nature and by training, than Lord Grey, and I am equally convinced that there is no one- more capable of upholding that point of view in the&apos;mind of-President Wilson0(Initialled)     B-.C    &apos;FOATlGN OFFICE., 2bth August, 1917 v(
