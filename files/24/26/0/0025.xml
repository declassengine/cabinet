It is h&apos;.-ped that the first shipment of Irish cattle will be bought tomorrow (loth September, 1917).STATISTICAL BRANCHtThe   monthly return of fish landed shows a decreased quantity in August compared with July, but a greater value.There was a very Bmall supply of pigs at the live stock markets during the last two weeks - only about half the average - and prices were consequently higher.HORTICUI-TrPJl BRANCH.249 fresh cases of Wart Disease of Potatoes have been reported and are being dealt with,PUBLICATIONS BRANCH,Many thousands of applications continue to be received for the leaflets and .pamphlets issued giving information of special and seasonal interest to growers.1.
FISHERIES DltVISIOff. Administrative Section.There continues to he a large correspondence connected with applications for relaxation of restrictions of fishing operations under the powers conferred upon the Board by the Sea Fishing (England and Wales) Order.Questions affecting the pollution of the Emsworth and Swale Oyster beds and of the Ouse,   Stour, and Cumberland Rivers were also dealt with.The important salmon fisheries in the Wye are threatened by new Government works at the mouth of bhe River and the Section are in communication with Departments concerned.Facilities have been secured for the shipment of cutch for the net making trade and efforts made for the creation of a larger home demand for netting to compensate makers for the loss of foreign trade.PermitmSe ct ion.Fishing permits have been granted to 25 vessels.The Admiralty have been provided with the usual information as to the movements of British fishing vessels.Reports have been received from the Board&apos;s officers as to the sinking of several fishing vessels, and have been communicated . to the Admiralty.Fishermen1s Registration and Recruiting Section.The calling up of fishermen for Naval service is becoming increasingly difficult and complicated owing principally to the age and civil obligations of the men concerned.    As a result of the August call over one hundred appeals for deferment have been or are being carefully investigated. &quot; The need for some effective means of securing younger and unenrolled men is becoming crucial and is being earnestly considered.A considerable amount of correspondence with the War Departments has taken place and the release of certain experienced fishtrade experts has been secured.     In view of the Yarmouth aerring season a large number of applications are pending for the temporary release of East Coast fish   curers.Fish Food Committee.Representatives on behalf of the Board are at Exeter making enquiries with a view to the re-opening of the Iympstone mussel beds.The Trade Branch are still engaged in making arrangements ior the autumn fishing on the Bast Coast, and the Committee are in correspondence with the Controller of Coal Mines as to the Provision of coal for the fishing fleet, the collieries having refused to supply more than last year.2.
Enquiries are &quot;being made for further sources of supply of hardwood turnings for the curers.     It is found that much is being used as bedding for horses, the supply of straw being very short.     No other substance can be used as a substitute by the curers.The Committee have been instrumental in securing supplies of tin plates for oanners from the merchants, who hoM stocks, and the question is still under investigation.The question of the detention of railway vans at Billingsgate Harket is receiving attention.Motor Loan Committeef.The placing and installing of engines has been proceeding satisfactorily.Gunned Boat3.It is hoped that the trials of three of these vessels which have been engined by the Committee, will be run within the next week.Fuel Supplies.The prices of petrol and paraffin have been raised 8 d. and 5d. per gallon respectively with the result that it is feared that many motor-boats will be obliged either to lay up or considerably reduce their fishing operations.The rise in price is also producing a serious difficulty in getting orews whose shares are liable to be reduced to such an extent that they find fishing less profitable and more hazardous than other occupations.The series of sharp rises in price, coupled with the increased price of other fishery supplies has produced a state of uncertainty of the future which is greatly detrimental to fishing enterprise and to the needful preparation in advance for various fishing seasons. It is also feared that unless something can be done to allow fishermen to obtain their fuel supplies at a steady price   the Committee&apos;s work will be seriously hampered.It has become an urgent necessity to supply the special Service Boats (for Fishery Protection) with fuel at the same price as that which prevailed when the Boaiis were placed at the disposal of the Government by their patriotio owners.     Having made careful and fruitless enquiries aa to the means of obtaining cheaper fuel, it has become evident to the Committee that the work has passed beyond the bounds of Departmental 3cope and that it is necessary for the Government to control the price as well as the distribution of fuel.Freshwater Fish.The principal work this week has been an inspection of certain fisheries near Beaulieu in Hants by a Sub-Committee of the Freshwater Fish Committee.     A report on the state of affairs in the Ouse near Bedford asked for by Mr. Prothero has been submitted.3.
