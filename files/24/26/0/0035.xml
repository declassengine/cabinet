13 September, 1917.1.        The period sinoe the events and comments with which it was possible to deal in the last report has been a very full one.     The Italian successes, Mr, Wilson&apos;s answer to the Pope, the German capture of Riga, the outbreak of something like civil war in Russia, the iesignation of the Polish State Council, are all events which have deeply affected German public and Government opinion.     The biggest oi these events, the Russian dissensions, cast its shadow before and was the subject of anticipatory comment in Germany-     The Sukhomlinoff trial, with its revelations of what took place on the eve of the Russian mobilisation Ukase of July 29 or 30, 1914 (the evidence of Generals Yanuschkevitch and Sukhomlinoff is contradictory as to the date, and Yanuschkevitch contradicts himself on this point), has supplied welcome materiel to the almost exhausted iactories of German propaganda.     The Chancellor himself has taken it up and has made it the text of a press interview in vjhich he seeks to prove by it the absolutely pacific action of Germany and the German liimperor on the eve of the war, the criminal guilt of Russia, and the complicity of England and France. All it really proves, however, is that the Tsar wes too late to stop his own mobilisation.A further memorandum will be issued by this 3ureau on the subject of the Sukhomlinoff trial;   but meanwhile it is interesting to note the new German campaign on the subject of responsibility for the war.     The question of this responsibility, after having been officially tabooed in connection with the
igHmmmjpgjB^xitSj&amp;^i^^----&gt;-1 2-2-Stockholm Conference, is being- emphasised now that the Stockholm Conference is &quot;off&quot;, and the danger of^further enlightenment feyof the German Minority Socialists from that quarter obviated. Dealt with by German methods, the question, it is evidently thought, may no?*r be used to influence American and neutral opinion.     In the case of America the calculation seems to be a quite hopeless one at this time of day, although the Chancellor, Dr. Michaelis, himself has entered the lists in an interview with the Manager of &apos;wolff rs Bureau.     The one point made by the Chancellor which might prove awkward in view of the present situation in France, is that Sukhomlinoff was sent to Paris at the time of M. Poincare&apos;s election to the Presidency, and that the presidential election was interpreted in Germany and elsewhere at the time in the sense of French and Russian aggressiveness.2.        Under the new Chancellor, the new Prussian Ministry and the new Imperial Secretaries of State (there is no Imperial Ministry, the Chancellor being the sole Imperial Minister), there is a strong reorudescence of German governmental press activity. The new Chief of the Propaganda, Baron von Braun, is described as being &quot;installed in the office of the Imperial Chancellor&quot;. The press has hitherto been worked, so far as foreign affairs are concerned, from the foreign Office, where tho notorious Dr. Hammann was succeeded last year by a military Director of the press Department.     If, as seems likely, the new Foreign Secretary, Baron von JCflhlmann, obtains, in consequence of his vastly superior knowledge and experience, the real control of Foreign Affaire, the Chancellor, although he is constitutionally the -foreign Minister of the Empire, will not be able to retain&quot;sole control of the German press.     In any case, squalls are imminent over this vrtiole region of politics.     The recent attacks in the Main Committee of the Reichstag on the extension of the military
censorship to political articles have been continued in the liberal and Socialist press with the support of some Catholic Centre and some National liberal journals.     It is beinj pointed out that the undertaking which v/as given to the Committee by Herr helfferichj the Vice-Chancellor, has not been fulfilled. He led the Committee to believe that the political censorship would be totally abolished.     On the contrary, the political censorship has become more stringent;   &quot;preventive&quot; control has been exercised;   and the Berlin telephonic coirespondence of leading journals like the Frankfurter Zeitunp; has been censored. This is a wholesome reminder of the realities of German conditions for that journal, which, for the edification of non-German countries, is constantly declaring that political discussion in Germany is less restricted than it is abroad.     T-e language of the protests  gainst the censorship is becoming more and more violent:   the paper in question, for example, telling the Government that it had better begin by censoring its own declarations and those of the Emperor &quot;which are much more open to criticism than utterances of other people which the censorship suppresses.&quot;The Pan-Germans, too, and all their kith and kin, are allowed a licence which is unfair by comparison with the treatment of the Majority press.     It is expected that there will be a lively debate on the whole subject ,/hen the Keichstag reassembles on September 26.3.       President Wilson and America in general occupy a great share of Germ.: a attention.    T ere are attempts to derive some comfort from Mr. Wilson&apos;s repudiation of peace terms i?hioh would mutilate any of the belligerent States or subject any of them to a commercial boycott after the war.     On the other hand, his out-spoken denunciation of the German system of Government and his declaration regarding the worthlessness of the word of
Germany&apos;s present rulers, unless supported by conclusive evidence of the popular will, have evidently struck home.     The Berlin correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung, fresh from his daily conversation et the Foreign Office, loses his usual self-possession and exclaims:&quot;IV Mr. Uilson will not believe what is said and asservated by Gorman official Quarters, it would amount to an insult, and not only an insult to individuals, but also to the law or nations, (sio) with the protection o  which l.i   tlilson is so busily occupied&quot;.Ak if anyone, least of all the G::r. . n. people and press, novv placed the slightest confidence in the word of the German GovernmentS     The Munich newspaper which represents the views of the Bavarian National Liberals urges that the recent proceedings in the Reichstag showed that there is agreement between the Reichstag Majority and the Government on the essential elements of the question oi peace-     But that is just what the proceedings in the Main Committee of the Eeichstag did not show. On the contrary, the Y/hole Majority press has been challenging Br. Michaelis to abandon his ambiguous attitude and come out int the open on the question of German peace terms.     Even Professor Hans Delbruck says, in the last number of his important magazine Breussische Jahrbucher:&quot;why has Dr. kichaelis found it necessary to set up the new Free Committee by his side?   We will ss&amp; say it straight out: it is precisely because he does not possess the confidence of the Reichstag.     How could he possess it after what has been taking place during the last four weeks?     If Dr.M&apos;ichaelis had not tacitly allowe &apos;  the press of the Keichstag Minority (the Pan-Germans ,-nl the Conservatives) week after week to keep on explaining away his assent to the (peace terms) resolu tion of the Majority and converting it into the contrary of assent, he would not now be under the necessity of instituting this Committee of Public Safety      Does the Reichstag really know tfhat the Chancellor v/ants and what his policy is?    The German people and the world at any rate heve no clear notion about it, and less than ever have they any clear notion after the latest incidents&quot;.President &apos;..ilson - &quot;in his shirt-sleeves&quot; as the Gorman presscomplains - has only said what the political spokesman of thevast majority of Germans are saying about the German Government
and the Emperor in their dealings with the Reichstag and the nation.     The German press can indeed hardly expect that their Emperor and their Government are going to he more straightforward in&apos;their dealings with enemy Powers at the peace negotiations than they have been in their dealings with the Reichstag ana the nation.In connection with Kerensky&apos;s speech at the Moscow Conference, the Majority-Socialist Vo_rw rts_ shows that the attempt to trick the enemy Powers is already &quot;being made by the German Government.     Kerensky referred to the renewal of separate peace offers, whereupon the &quot;North German Gazette&quot; virtuously repudiated the charge that Germany had again been approaching Russia,     This repudiation is described as an evasion of the point at issue, since it was to Rumania that the latest separate peace overtures were made.     The same paper described this policy as one of &quot;going round and offering peace like a pedlar&quot; (Priedenshausiererel) At the same time the German Government is always trotting out the Reichstag&apos;s peace resolution of July 19 and dangling it before . the Allies as a magnanimous offer.     But, as the Yorw rts manages, in spite of the censorship, to insinuate, the German Government cannot honestly dress its windows with this resolution, for Dr. Michaelis did not honestly accept it.     The German Government is trying to make capital out of the resolution while itself not unequivocally endorsing it.4.        Altogether, there has been a marked change in the last few weeks in the attitude of a section, probably by far the larger section, of the hitherto Governmental Socialists. The tone oi the press and the speakers of that section is gradually approximating to that of the Minority Socialists.     Much excitement has been caused by an article in the Vorwarts on the passage in President Viiilson&apos;s reply to the Pope in which the American President says that the guarantee of the German people&apos;s
will is necessary for any satisfactory peace and that the word of the present regime in Germany is worthless.     A large section of the German press has rejected with indignation the President&apos;s invitation to Germany to set her house in order, hut the Yorwflrts, on the other hand, urges that it would he unworthy of GezAaxiy to refuse to do so, for &quot;The thought would be unbearable that the men at the front were fighting not for the preservation of the Empire, but for the maintenance of a state of things that is not worth maintaining, etc. etc.&quot;    Evil communications have nevertheless corrupted good party morals, and a section of the Majority Socialists has become so governmental that it is fighting the advocates of genuine reform.     Ernst Heilmann, one of the members of this section, has just been delighting the heart of bureaucracy by an article in the Glooke in favour of a &quot;Government of Officials&quot; (Beamtenstaat), in preference to the modern parliamentary State in which the deputies and the Cabinet Ministers, he says, are mostly lawyers and have nothing in common with the working-classes.     He refers to the development of an admirable &quot; bureaucracy in the Social Democracy itself and says that in Germany the Socialist Party organisation and the Socialist Trade Unions are managed by their own paid officials, who are men practically acquainted with the work, not mere politicians.     Why, he asks, should the State be less well officered?    He infinitely prefers the bureaucratic State to the State governed by politicians, and he would &quot;democratise&quot; the State only by opening the higher official career to the hundreds of thousands of humbler officials who have won their spurs in the provincial and local administration.     &quot;This&quot;, he says, &quot;is real democratisation;   to make the Government &apos;parliamentary&apos; does not lead to the real goal, but rather leads people awa}&apos; from it&quot;..lieilmann&apos;s views are interesting as showing how closely the bureaucratic ideal of Government is interWined with the traditions of the German people and how difficult it will be
to uproot it.     Yet it is certain that bureaucratic Government in a monarchy, like the Prusso-German monarchy, means &quot;Government from above&quot;, with all the evils in international relations which P2eside.ot Wilson denounces.     The si-:ns of a split in the Majority Socialist Party indicate that the movement against Government by bureaucratic exports (who have shown themselves very inexpert in the management of foreign affairs) is making headway.      very-revelation of German iolly and failure in the conduct of foreign policy will strengthen the movement, as will the disclosures of the Emperor&apos;s secret and reckless interventions (the &quot;Willy-Kicky&quot; correspondence; the Imperial telegram to President Wilson shortly-after the outbreak of war, now published by Mr. Gerard, etc.)5.        There is confirmation of what was said in the report last week regarding the anxiety awakened by the new German advance in Russia.     It is a &quot;mad situation&quot;, says a Socialist journal, that a State which has long been desiring peace should be condemned to advance and to &quot;conquer&quot;.     If once Germany gets herself thoroughly involved in the Russian imbroglio, she will not have     h time ox strength left for much else.     And in the interest of post-war economics, if for no other reason, she must anxiously desire the settlement of Russia, though not, of course, Russia&apos;s military revival.The resignation of the Polish Council-General is another blow to German schemes, particularly to the employment of the projected &quot;Polish Army&quot; in the service of the Central Powers.     A Berlin newspaper had disclosed &quot;by an indiscretion;?Ithe fact that the Reichstag Majority in the Main Committee, where the discussions on the Polish ouestion were absolutely secret, is in favour of an independent Polish Ministry and a Polish popular assembly.     The Majority further demanded the abolition of the economic frontier between the German and the Austrian
territory.     The disastrous effects of this artificial war-frontier are fully explained, so far as the food-supply is concerned, in our White Paper of last yearf1^    The other effects of the economic separation of two regions which were one in peace, are equally deplorable.6.       Meanwhile we may note a most cheering symptom, accounts of which reach us from a reliable source, viz: that in the German Array the Socialistic idea is rapidly spreading and that the authorities, powerless to check it in view of the deaths of so many of the old-time N.C.O.&apos;s, are becoming seriously alarmed.    This does not of course necessarily portend the loosening of the bonds of discipline;   but, taken in conjunction with the very numerous though futile strikes in towns and industrial districts, the matter is sufficiently grave to cause considerable anxiety in higher Military and other circles,G.
