[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]*J y -jPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1924,SECRET.CP. 555 (24). ...      ^ 3 9CABINET.EGYPT.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I THINK it is precipitate to take the view that if Ziwar Pasha&apos;s Administration fails we must choose between the annexation and the evacuation of Egypt. Our position in Egypt, except for the short period of the protectorate, has always rested on a fiction supported by force. We ruled for nearly forty years on the theory that Egypt was &quot;a tributary province of the Turkish Empire in British military occupation.&quot; I do not see why some similar formula should not be devised in the future. For instance, &quot;Egypt is an independent State acting in all matters of external and internal policy in accordance with British advice.&quot; So far from agreeing that &quot;Cromerism&quot; is impossible, I regard it as inevitable. We must not deem ourselves incapable of exercising a complete control over the whole administra-tion of Egypt, while at the same time observing and respecting all the forms and procedure of a native Egyptian State.In order to carry out such a policy successfully, we must have a persevering will of our own. The lamentable muddle into which Egypt has fallen of late years is due to the realisation by the Egyptian Nationalists that Great Britain for the time being-no longer possesses such a will. It is sufficient to recite the acts of violence, of weakness and of vacillation which have marked our policy in Egypt since the Great War. We declared a protectorate over the country, and procured the assent of our Allies, including the United States, to this historic step. The ink of President Wilson&apos;s pen was hardly dry when we renounced our protectorate over Egypt and promised to set up an independent Egyptian Kingdom. We put Fuad Pasha on the throne against the popular will, and guaranteed the crown, not only to himself, but to his son. We had hardly made this solemn undertaking when we proceeded to throw fuad and his dynasty to the mercies of an independent Egyptian National Government. Our nominee for one policy was left to face the swiftly approaching consequences of its reversal. We endeavoured to console him by making him a King. When this unfortunate puppet, whom we had hoisted into precarious eminence, was repeatedly assured that we were about to desert him, he naturally began to look about for a local foundation and to seek for friends among those forces hostile to British influence, to which Great Britain proposed to hand over the mastership of the country. When we saw him taking these reasonable precautions, we made naive comments upon Oriental &quot;duplicity&quot; and &quot;love of intrigue.&quot; Duplicity is the natural resource of the weak when the strong fail in their duty. Intrigue may be the only resource when policy is non-existent. Thus we lost the King and such influence as he could command, and at the same time encouraged every hostile and subversive element in the country.Our treatment of Zaghlul is a perfect cameo of &quot;how not to do it.&quot; We first deport Zaghlul to Malta and make a martyr1 of him, while admitting the justice of the cause of Egyptian independence. We then allow him to return as a national hero and make a triumphal entry into Alexandria and Cairo. We then deport him again, this time to the Seychelles. We bring him back to Gibraltar, allow him to take the waters in Europe, and finally to return to Egypt a second time and make a second, and still more spectacular, triumphal entry. We knew all the time that Zaghlul was our bitter foe, and our treatment of him was certainly calculated to confirm him in this mood. By twice deporting him, we made him a martyr; by twice bringing him back, we made him a conqueror. If one had wished to prescribe a receipt for &quot;How [12458]
to foment antagonism against oneself in an Oriental country,&quot; one could not have set about it more skilfully or more successfully. Finally, we hand over the Govern-ment to Zaghlul the Conqueror, under an instrument which leaves every burning question between Britain and Egypt unsettled, and then we try to negotiate a treaty with him for our advantage in flat denial of his own cause. Here, again, everything worked out exactly as might have been expected. Consequences followed causes simply, swiftly and surely, until by an unbroken chain we reached the pistol volley which killed Sir Lee Stack on the 19th November.Such is the situation to which the Foreign Secretary and His Majesty&apos;s present Government are the heirs. The strong, sober and successful action which has been taken since the murder of Sir Lee Stack has regained for us a fresh opportunity. We have now only to make up our minds what we mean to do, and then to carry out our purpose unswervingly for four or five years, to retrieve the disasters and blunders of the past. So far as policy is concerned, we really have very little choice. We cannot leave Egypt. We cannot allow any other European Power to set foot in Eg3&apos;pt. We cannot sit on the banks of the Suez Canal and allow Egypt to sink into anarchy, while forbidding all help and guidance from Europe or America. We have got to govern Egypt and to govern Egypt well. Finance, police, the army, railways, irrigation, education, sanitation every one of these services must once again be made a credit to Great Britain. We have got to make the Egyptians feel that this is what we mean to do and that nothing will turn us from our resolve. We have got to use Egyptians as our instruments. We shall find plenty once our intentions are known. We may treat them with every form of ceremonial consideration. We may keep ourselves in the background as much as possible. But if we are to succeed, no one in the Nile Valley must have the slightest doubt whose will is law throughout the land.There is, however, one statement in the Foreign Office paper produced under Mr. MacDonald&apos;s Administration which would seem to suggest that we are in a helpless position. We are told that &quot; a &apos; down tools&apos; movement in the public services and the railways and provincial services would leave the capital with its 600,000 inhabitants foodless in a few days and would force His Majesty&apos;s Government either to withdraw their troops from Cairo or take measures which would in fact amount to a reconquest of the country.&quot; This is a matter on which the military authorities ought to have a word to say. It is, of course, quite easy to have food in Cairo sufficient for the British troops and European inhabitants for several weeks; and certainly it would be. possible to bring more in up the Nile. If the Egyptians in the provinces chose to starve the 500,000 Egyptian inhabitants of the capital, they would be doing a very foolish thing. We should no doubt do our best to save these unfortunate people from the consequences of their countrymen&apos;s folly. But it would be their trouble, not ours. I have not the slightest doubt that the first pinch of scarcity would make all classes in Cairo co-operate actively in the pacification of the country and the restoration of the communications. . The mere fact that it was known that the Europeans and the British troops had adequate food reserves would deter the Cairo agitators from any such scheme. We are surely not going to let ourselves be bounced out of Egypt by threats of this kind.But there are certain perils which it would be well to avoid. We are at the present moment governing Egypt by arbitrary power. We are no doubt right to veil that power as much as possible. But it is no use trying to half-govern a country. We have pushed over the National Administration of Zaghlul. We have coerced the King into installing an Administration submissive to our wishes. The so-called Parliament which we laboriously brought into existence has been dissolved. It is hoped that the elections may be so worked as to produce a tame Parliament in its place. While our newly asserted will-power is producing these results. apparently quite easily- we cannot disclaim all responsibility for the internal good government of Egypt. We cannot acquiesce in, nay, encourage, the exodus of the British officials. We cannot contemplate with complacency the degeneration in every form of admini-strative life which is already swiftly overtaking the land we rescued from barbarism and shielded from invasion. Least of all can we meditate the withdrawal of our troops from Cairo in the despairing hope that the Egyptian Pashas and wealthy classes will be so terrified at the near approach of anarchy that they will beg us to remain. Someone must be responsible for the welfare of the State and people. We have got to shoulder the burden.Why should we deem ourselves incapable of the toil 1 Why should we be found less capable of maintaining our interest in North Africa than France, or even than italy ?   Are we really to be pushed out of Egypt as Spain is being ejected from
Morocco? Surely now that we have stable conditions at home, we ought.to have the governing strength and ability to fulfil our mission in Egypt, Why is it that matters have so markedly improved.in the last six weeks ? No blood has been shed; not a shot has been fired;, no state of siege even has yet been created,&apos; As long as.we do not weaken, or. waver, the chances of a happy issue are good. I am firmly convinced that we have only to be resolved and persevering, we have only to point in one direction unchangingly over a definite period of years, to bring Egypt back to the paths of progress and content.&quot; . w. s. c.Treasury Chambers, December 30, 1924.
