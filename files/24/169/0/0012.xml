[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1  ^ ^SECRET. CP. 511 (24).CABINET.THE POSITION OF THE DOMINIONS IN RELATION TO RUSSIA.cmMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office on the subject of the position of the Dominions in relation to Russia. This memorandum has already been seen by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and is circulated to the Cabinet at his suggestion.L. S. A.Colonial Office, November 27,1924.IMMEDIATELY after the late Government took office, the attention of the Secretary of State (Mr. Thomas) was drawn to the position of the Dominions in relation to the question of the recognition of the Soviet Government, and it was pointed out that it would seem most desirable that no decision should be arrived at on this question until any policy contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government had been fully explained to the Dominions and they had had an opportunity of expressing their views. Before the Secretary of State had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Prime Minister (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald), intimation was received from the Cabinet Office on the 29th January that the Prime Minister had decided, without putting the matter before the Cabinet, to recognise the Soviet Government de jure. Accordingly, all that was possible was to arrange that the note to the Soviet Government should not actually be presented until the Dominion Governments had been informed of what was contemplated. This was done in the following manner : The Dominion Governments were informed on the 30th January (by despatch in the case of the Irish Free State and by telegram in the case of the other Dominions) that His Majesty&apos;s Government had had under consideration the question of future relations with Russia, and had come to the conclusion that a resumption of normal intercourse was urgently required in the interests of European resettlement, and that, accordingly, they proposed to address to the Soviet Government, within the next few days, a note, the substance of which was set out, according de jure recognition. The note was, infact, presented on the 1st February, i.e., two days later.No replies were received, except from the Irish Free State Government, who, in a despatch, dated the 22nd February, stated that they noted the proposal of His Miajesty&apos;s Government to recognise the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and assumed that no action prejudicial to the rights of the Irish Free State Government or its nationals would be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the course of the negotiations with Russia. The attitude of certain of the other Dominion Govern-ments may be gathered from the following facts :&apos;--(1.) Canada. According to press statements, M. Yazikofi, the Head of the Soviet Trade Delegation in Canada, wrote to Mr. Mackenzie King on the 20th March asking whether &quot; the de jure recognition of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics proclaimed by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government on the 1st February last comprehends recognition by Canada.&quot; Mr. Mackenzie King replied on the 24th March: &quot; I have the honour, in the best interests of both countries, to represent that Canada is prepared to recognise the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot; Mr. Mackenzie King was asked in the Canadian House of Commons on the 20th March: When the Government of Great Britain recently recognised the Union of the Soviet Republic, did that mean that Canada had also recognised that Union? Or has the Canadian Government recognised them separately? &quot; He replied : &quot; The Canadian Government [12316]
will take its own position in regard to the Soviet Republic just as they would take their position in regard to anything else &apos;&apos;; and, in reply to a further question, he said : &quot; When Great Britain takes a certain,position in an international matter, the Dominion Government may, for the same reason, take a similar position; but, so far as the question whether or not Canada in any particular matter affecting its own people, and their relations with other countries is concerned, we will exercise in these matters the same rights as the Parliament of Great Britain would exercise in relation to their people and their relations to other countries.&quot; In the Canadian House of Commons on the 23rd June Mir. Mackenzie King stated, in reply to a question whether the Canadian Government had definitely recognised the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics : &quot; CanadVs formal recognition of the, Union qf Soviet Socialist Republics was conveyed to their official agent in Canada, M. A. Yazikoff, in a letter from the,Prime,Minister, dated tire 24th.March, 1924.&quot; A press, cable from Ottawa,, dated the 8th August, stated that, at a., conference with i, M. YazikpfL Mr.. Mackenzie King, &quot; made..,it clear that Canadianrecognition of the Soviet.extended only to trade matters.&quot;.(2.) Australia. In the House of Representatives on the 13th August, Mr. Bruce made the following statement as to the recognition of the Soviet Govern-ment: &quot; As to the first matter, the action was taken by the present British Government immediately after it assumed office, without consultation with the, other self-governing parts of the Empire.. Technically,, this was not a (Compliance with the now established principle of consultation with the Dominions of: all, questions, of Imperial foreign policy. But, as the Commonwealth Government, did not consider that, the interests of Australia were affected by, or that any complications involving Australia were likely to arise from, its, not being consulted, it made no protest, particularly in view of subsequent assurances, which it has received from the British ^Government, of. its desire for the closest consultation, showing that the course,adopted on this occasion will not form a, precedent for action, in. the future.&quot;. (Mr, Bruce&apos;s reference in the last, part of his statement, was no doubt to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s telegram of. the 23rd,June, in which he stated that His ifajesty&apos;s,Government fully accepted the principle of continuous consultation, the importance of which had been emphasised by the Imperial War Conference of 1917^)(3.) Union of South Africa. On the. 25th February the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State,wrote to the High Commissioner for,the Union asking &apos;&apos; what action the South African Government proposes taking in reference to the recognition by Great Britain of the.Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot; The High Commissioner referred the question,^ the Union Government and received a reply that the Union,Government had taken note of the de jure recognition of the.Union of Soviet Socialist Republics by His Majesty&apos;s Government.. ,The reply, proceeded : &quot;In view of the fact that the Union Government was. not consulted,, it is not proposed to take any action.&quot; The High Commissioner, consulted the Colonial Office semi-officially as to the reply to.be returned to the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State, and at the suggestion of the Colonial Office merely informed. him that the. Union Government had taken note of the de jure recognition of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics by His Majesty&apos;s Government., (At the first meeting of the, t Second, Committee. of the Anglo-Soviet Conference on the 25th April, the Soviet, Representatives raised the question whether the act of de jure recognition covered Canada, and the other British Dominions and Colonies. The British members,undertook to endeavour to obtain a legal opinion on the point. Asa result, a statement drafted by Sir Cecil Hurst and concurred.in by the Colonial Office was circulated; to, the Committee and subsequently included in the Minutes of the Conference.   It was in the following terms: &quot; The British Delegation are advised that,in view of the terms of the note of the 1st February it is unlikely that the Courts,in; any part of the British Empire would maintain that the Government of the Union of,,Soviet Socialist Republics had hot been recognised. In accordance with, the usual British constitutional practice, the various self-governing portions of His Majesty&apos;s
It will be seen from the above that there has been a certain amount of feeling in the Dominions as to the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government in according de jure recognition to the Soviet Government without the Dominion Governments having been consulted. It therefore seems essential that, if it should be in contemplation to adopt any course of action which might lead to a suspension of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government, the position should be fully explained to the Dominion Governments in advance, and it would also seem most desirable that, if possible, the course of events should be such that the responsibility for the suspension of diplomatic relations should rest upon the Soviet Government and not upon His Majesty&apos;s Government. It may be added that in May 1923, when His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplated termination of the Russian Trade Agreement in the absence of a satisfactory reply from the Soviet Government to their representations on various points, the Dominion Governments were informed in advance, though they were not formally consulted as to the policy proposed. Of the Dominions, only Canada had adhered to the Trade Agreement, and a separate telegram was sent to the Canadian Government stating that in view of the effect of the termination of the Agreement on trade relations between Canada and Russia, as well as between this country and Russia, the Cabinet were specially anxious to give the Canadian Government the earliest possible intimation of the position. In any case, the termination of the Trade Agreement would, of course, have been a less far-reaching step than would be the suspension of diplomatic relations with a Government which has already been recognised de jure.November 18, 1924.Dominions will make their own arrangements with regard to their future commercial relations with the Union. Any agreement or agreements which may be concluded as the result of the present negotiations will not bind the Dominion Governments.&apos;&apos;
