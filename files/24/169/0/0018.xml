SECRET.CP. 516 (24).CABINET.AMERICAN CLAIM TO REPARATION.Memoeandum by the Chancelloe of the Exchequer.1. THE United States Government, which did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, is putting forward a claim in respect of damages to United States citizens in the war (both before and after America became belligerent) against the Dawes annuities to be paid by Germany to meet charges arising under the Treaty of Versailles.* The amount of that claim is unknown. It is popularly reported that applications have been received for about 1,100 million dollars, but that the American-German Tribunal of Assessment may reduce this total to under 500 million dollars. Whatever the amount, if the American claim were allowed, it would reduce the sum available to the signatories of the Treaty of Versailles for their Treaty charges, including reparations.2. We are advised that legally America has no claim. She cannot benefit under a Treaty whose obligations she has not assumed. Moreover, the Treaty of Versailles gives the Reparation Commission a first charge on all the assets and revenues of Germany, and any subsequent agreement by Germany with America could only give a claim ranking after that first charge.3. The United States urge that the Dawes Report speaks of claims by the &quot; Allied and Associated Governments&quot; and that these words were inserted specially to cover the present American claim. But the Dawes Committee were appointed by the Reparation Commission under the Treaty of Versailles to consider how the German Budget could be balanced and implicitly how it could meet the Treaty of Versailles charges on Germany. The Committee were private individuals who, neither by their terms of reference nor by their actual knowledge, were in a position to decide on claims outside the Treaty. They never in fact discussed the matter; the Treaty phrase &quot;Allied and Associated Governments&quot; was merely inserted in order not to debar any claim which might be a good one under the Treaty. There was good reason to insert it because America had in fact a perfectly good claim for her armies of occupation. But in no circumstances could the Dawes Committee have pronounced on a large international issue, such as the present American claim.4. But the case does not depend on mere legal arguments. All other countries which signed the Treaty of Versailles had their claims to reparation valued by the Reparation Commission and, in most cases, very considerably cut down. The United States never put in such a claim and indeed disavowed any intention of claiming reparations. America has not had her claims valued by the Reparation Commission, but by a private American-German Tribunal. The Germans, if their total payment is fixed by the Dawes annuity, have no particular interest in cutting down claims.Moreover, the Reparation Commission would only admit claims for damage during the period when the claimant was a belligerent. The American claim is known to include claims for damage pre the entry of America into the war.f* See O.P. 513 (24).t It is interesting to observe that in the draft Treaty of Arersailles there was a special clause authorising the recovery of such pre-war damage against the property of German nationals sequestrated in America.[12340][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.
5. Other countries, signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, have to account to the Reparation Pool for the assets which they hold. America is believed to hold about 300 million dollars of German private property, of which she has returned, under the Winslow Act, 20 million to 30 million dollars to the owners. In so far as she does not use this asset for pre-war claims, then she ought to make it available for the general Reparation Pool. Further, when in 1920 the Allied countries received compensation for the tonnage lost in the war, America retained the whole of the tonnage seized in American ports (about 164 per cent, of her actual tonnage lost), and the understanding with President Wilson was that she should pay for the excess in cash to the Reparation Pool. She has never done so. The amount is believed to be about 7 millions sterling, less expenditure on repairs.7. In our view, if, on grounds of international courtesy, we are to admit this claim, we must first be told to what figure it amounts in order that we may consider the price of our courtfi^^^In^thjL.second place, if the Americans wish now to share in the benefits of the Treaty of Versailles, they ought, if not to undertake all the obligations of the Treaty, at any rate to admit that they must have their claim valued, and account for their assets, in the same way as the Allies. In other words, they must set off their assets against the claim ; they must allow the Reparation Commission to consider the basis of the claim, and they must accept a method of payment which will ensure their ranking equally with the Allies both in benefits and responsibilities.(Initialled)W.
