fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1924.SECRET. CP. 5DB 24).CABINET.IRISH FREE STATE LAND PURCHASE (LOAN GUARANTEE) BILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN the King&apos;s Speech at the beginning of the last session of Parliament the Unionist Government undertook to pass into law a Bill to guarantee the principal and interest of the Bonds to be issued by the Government of the Irish Free State under their Land Act, and when the Labour Government came into power my predecessor circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum (CP. 128 (24), circulated herewith) explaining the reasons for the Bill and urging his colleagues to carry out that pledge. The Government decided to introduce the Bill (Cabinet Conclusions 13 (24)) and the necessary Financial Resolution was passed on the 30th July last.We are clearly pledged, both to the Government of the Irish Free State-and to the Irish landlords, to pass the Bill into law at an early date; and as our predecessors are also pledged, I do not anticipate that there will be opposition from any quarter.I had intended to include the Bill in the list of Bills to be introduced at an early date, but not necessarily before Christmas. I have to-day, however, seen Judge Wylie, the Land Commissioner in the Irish Free State, who has brought to my notice very cogent reasons why the Bill should, if it is at all possible, be passed into law before Parliament adjourns.   The reasons urged by him are as follows : 1. Bonds to the extent of  100,000 have already been placed to the credit of several estates and the lands &quot; vested &quot; in the Land Commission. These bonds must in the immediate future be allocated amongst the several persons entitled thereto.2. Bonds to the extent of at least another  1,500,000 will within the next month be placed to the credit of other estates and the lands similarly &quot; vested.&quot; These bonds will also be allocated amongst the several persons entitled thereto.3. As soon as allocation takes place some of the bonds will undoubtedly come on the market, and if the guarantee is not completed their value will be greatly depreciated.4. Allocation cannot be delayed because during the period between vesting and allocation the . -downer only receives 4i per cent, on the bonds whilst paying full intei -st at the rate of 6 per cent, or 7 per cent, on encumbrances and other charges on the estate. As soon as allocation takes place the encumbrances and superior interests will be paid off in bonds.5. Vesting cannot be delayed because it is only after that date that the tenants get the full reduction on their rents, and the Free State Government is being pressed to expedite such reduction.6. A Free State Act is necessary to complete the guarantee. This cannot be introduced until the British Bill becomes law, and if the British Bill is delayed until after Christmas it will certainly be the end of March, and possibly later, before the Irish Bill can be passed and the guarantee completed. By that time as much as  500,000 bonds may be put on the market and sold at a depreciated figure, while the landowners who have delayed allocation pending the completion of the guarantee will have lost heavily in the difference between their income from the bonds and their outgoings, which until allocation they will have to pay in cash.[12319] b
It will be appreciated, therefore, that any delay in the passing of the Bill may involve an appreciable loss to the Irish landowners, who are undoubtedly entitled to look to us for protection in this matter.As I have already stated, I believe that the Bill will be entirely uncontroversial; and I desire to urge very strongly that the Bill should be introduced at the earliest possible moment after the meeting of Parliament and, if possible, passed into law before the adjournment.L.S. AMERY.November 26,1924.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.].Printed for the Cabinet. February 1924.101SECRET.CP. 128 (24).CABINET.BRITISH GUAEANTEE FOR THE BONDS TO BE ISSUED UNDER THE. IRISH FREE STATE LAND ACT OF 1923.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WITH reference to Conclusion 2 of the meeting of the Cabinet held on the 13th February, 1924 (Cabinet 13 (24)), I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of the Financial Agreement between the British Government and the Irish Free State Government, dated the 12th February, 1923, and copies of despatches, which passed between the two Governments in December last.It will be seen from paragraph 2 (B) of the Financial Agreement that His Majesty&apos;s Government is pledged to guarantee the bonds to be issued under the Free State Land Act, and that this pledge was repeated and confirmed in the despatch from the Duke of Devonshire, dated the 22nd December last.Apart, however, from the fact that the British Government is pledged to the Government of the Irish Free State in this matter, I regard the early introduction of a Bill on this subject as desirable for another reason. Irish landlords, whose property will be purchased under the Act, have constantly expressed their fear that the bonds in which the purchase-money will be paid will, in the absence of such a guarantee, fall far below their face-value, and that they will thereby incur serious loss. I do not believe that there is any real justification for this fear; but I have no doubt that the giving of the guarantee will afford much satisfaction, at no expense to the Exchequer, to a body of men who at present feel that they are suffering under an injustice; and it was with this in view, I understand, that the late Government mentioned the proposed Bill in the King&apos;s Speech.If the Bill is to be introduced, I see no object in delay, and I trust therefore that my colleagues will authorise the Chancellor of the Exchequer to proceed with it at once.J. H. T.Colonial Office,February 21,&apos; 1924.FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND THE IRISH FREE STATE GOVERNMENT.I.(A.) Completed and Pending Purchase A agreements. It is agreed that: 1. The Free State Government undertake to pay at agreed intervals to the appropriate fund the full amount of the annuities accruing due from time to time, making themselves responsible for the actual collection from the tenant-purchaser.2. The security for such payments shall be primarily a Free State guarantee fund similar to that under existing legislation, and, secondarily, the central fund of the Irish Free State.[12319]
3. The British Government shall continue as at present to provide the stock and cash necessary to finance purchase agreements pending at this date. Should any question arise as to whether any case is a pending agreement, the same shall be referred to Mr. Justice Wylie, whose decision shall be final.4. The British Government shall provide out of monies voted by Parliament, the cost of interest and sinking fund on bonus and excess stock as already issued or required for pending purchase agreements, together with the remuneration of the Banks of England and Ireland for management, subject to a contribution by the Irish Eree State at the rate of  160,000 per annum.Provided that such payments on both sides shall be without prejudice to the ultimate financial settlement.5. The cost of administration of land purchase in the Free State area, except as provided under paragraph 4 above, shall be borne by the Irish Free State.(B.) Completion of Land Purchase (new scheme).1. The terms of any new scheme which the Free State Government may propose to enact after such consultation with landlords and tenants as they may think necessary shall be subject to the concurrence of the British Government in consideration of the guarantee mentioned below.2. The Free State Government shall finance any such new scheme by the issue of an Irish stock at 4-^ per cent., the capital and interest of which, subject to agreed provision for redemption, shall be guaranteed by the British Government in the same way as it might guarantee a Colonial or Dominion Government loan.3. The Free State shall provide security for payment of interest and sinking fund under the new scheme as under (A) 2 above.(C.) The Free State agrees to continue the Office of Public Trustee without prejudice to the right of any beneficiary to apply to a competent court for the transfer -of his trust.II. Compensation.It is agreed that 1. The division of cost shall be on the basis of existing arrangements (i.e., heads of working arrangements, paragraph 5, and the supplementary instructions to the Compensation (Ireland) Commission).2. The general principle shall be that of a quarterly refund by the British Government on the following basis : (a.) The Commission shall report, in respect of the awards made by them in any quarter, in what shares the aggregate amount of these awards is apportionable between the two Governments. On payment being made by the Free State Government on foot of any award made in the said quarter, the Free State Government shall be entitled, by quarterly demands, to recover from the British Government an amount equal to such a percentage of the payment (including any -advance adjusted therein) as the aforesaid share of the British Government forms of the combined shares of the two Governments, after deducting from the product of the above percentage a fixed sum of  83,333 6s. 8^.The said sum of  83,333 6s. 8^. shall be taken into account for this purpose for not more than twelve quarters.(b.) Such demands shall be discharged by the British Government in the course of the settlement from time to time of mutual cash liabilities between the two Governments.(c.) For the purpose of (a) all awards made up to the 31st March, 1923, shall be deemed to have been made in the quarter ending on that date, and the first demand of the Free State shall be in respect of payments made up to that date.(d.) The payments made under this arrangement shall be deemed to be provisional, and subject to final adjustment at the conclusion of the Commissions enquiry.(e.) The British Government waives in favour of the Free State Government any claim to benefit under the Agreements between the two Governments and Lloyd&apos;s Underwriters and certain other Insurance Companies.
lll.-Payment under the Irish Railways Settlement Act.The British Government agree not to press for a refund by the Irish Free State of any portion of the above, but reserve the right to claim in the ultimate financial settlement that the whole of the payments made under Section 11 of the Railways Act, 1921, and under the Irish Railways (Settlement of Claims) Act, 1921, both in Great Britain and Ireland should be treated as public debt for the purpose of article 5 of the treaty. The Free State Government take note of this reservation without prejudice to its position in the ultimate financial settlement..IV. Refund of Cost of Munitions.The British Government agree that the cost of munitions of war supplied to the Irish Government up to the present date shall constitute a debt to be funded for the purpose of adjustment at the ultimate financial settlement (the exact amount due to be settled by agreement) on the understanding that the Irish Free State agree to pay cash for future supplies.V. Royal Irish Constabulary.The Free State Government, without prejudice to their position at the ultimate financial settlement, agree to repay to the British Government^ per cent, of the pensions and compensation allowances payable to ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary under the Constabulary Acts, subject to the exception mentioned in article 10 of the treaty.The British Government agree to waive their claim for any contribution in respect of extra statutory non-recurrent payments made in connection with the disbandment of the Force.VI. Haulbowline Dockyard.1. It is agreed that lands and buildings shall be transferred to the I.F.S. subject to the understanding that such lands and buildings shall be treated generally in the same way as military establishments under the &quot; Heads of Working Arrangements.&quot;2. (a.) As regards fixtures, unerected plant and floating craft, the I.F.S. claim under the treaty and constitution, and on the analogy of military establishments, whatever is needed for carrying on the yard in working order.(&amp;.) The British Government, while holding that there is a broad distinction in principle under the treaty between naval and military services, and that the claims of the I.F.S. under paragraph 2 (a) above are therefore inadmissible on legal grounds, are nevertheless prepared without prejudice to agree in the proceedure proposed, in paragraph 3 below as a practical working arrangement.! 3. If the Admiralty desires to remove for its own purposes any of the fixtures, unerected plant or floating craft, the I.F.S. will agree to the removal of so much as will not prejudice the working of the yard subject to the I.F.S. being given credit in the ultimate financial settlement for such part of the property removed, as is not surplus to normal requirements (on the analogy of military movables under the &quot; Heads of Working Arrangements &quot;).4.-(a.) The I.F.S. contends that &quot;normal requirements&quot; mean the require-ments of the yard when carried on as a dockyard, whatever be the use to which it is put hereafter by the I.F.S.(b.) The British Government contends that normal requirements mean actual requirements.Decision on this point to be reserved for the ultimate financial settlement.5. It is agreed that a cash payment shall be made on account of the British claim for a refund of the cost of maintenance of the yard on the principle agreed under Head IX of this Agreement.VII. Local Loans.1. It is agreed that the Free State Government shall make payments to the Local Loans Fund on account of outstanding arrears at the fixed rate of  25,000 a quarter as from the 1st April, 1923, until such time as the amount of irrecoverable debt on this account can be ascertained and agreed between the two Governments.2. As regards future collection, the principle laid down in Article 4 (iii) of the
Order in Council of the 1st April, 1922, shall continue to be applied between the-British Government and the Free State Government pending further consideration.VIII. Annuities under the Irish Railways Act, &amp;c.The Free State Government agree, without prejudice to the ultimate financial settlement, to pay to the Treasury the amounts due for payments of annuities arising from expenditure in the Free State under the Railways (Ireland) Act, 1896, the Public Offices Site (Dublin) Act, 1903, the Telegraph Acts and the Military Works Acts.IX. Recoverable Charges.It is agreed that in future not less than 80 per cent, of these charges shall be paid by the Free State on account immediately on presentation of the claim, a reasonable period being allowed for discussion of any question which may be raised as regards the balance.X. Property Losses in Irish Rebellion, 1916.The British Government agree to meet payments remaining to be made in respect of property awards already made, and the Free State Government to accept liability as from the 1st April, 1923, in respect of awards for personal injuries outstanding.XI. Claims against Local Authorities for Extra Police. The British Government agree to withdraw this claim.XII. Arrears of Taxes as on April 1, 1922.The British Government agree that all such arrears are collectable by the Irish Government for the benefit of their Exchequer.JOHN W. HILLS.        L. T. MacCOSGAIR.February 12, 1923.F. 279.(No. 359.) Viceregal Lodge, Dublin,My Lord Duke, &apos;       December 21, 1923.I have the honour, by request of my Ministers, to refer to conversations which have from time to time taken place between my Ministers and His Majesty&apos;s Government with reference to the Land Bonds to be issued under &quot; The Irish Free State Land Act, 1923.&quot;2. In the course of these conversations His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed, in pursuance of what they regarded as obligations undertaken by their predecessors prior to the Treaty to facilitate the completion of land purchase in Ireland, to ask the British Parliament to guarantee the Land Blonds.3. To this proposal my Ministers agreed, and, as it will be necessary to begin the issue of the bonds in the course of the next few months, they would be glad to be-informed what steps His Majesty5s Government propose to take in the matter.I have, &amp;c. (Signed)        T. M. HEALY.His Grace,The Duke of Devonshire, K.G., &amp;c, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.Irish Free State. (No. 748.)Sir, Downing Street, December 22, 1923.I: have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency&apos;s despatch-No. 359 of the 21st December, in which you remind His Majesty&apos;s Government of the
0proposal which they made to ask Parliament to guarantee the bonds to be issued under the Land Act (No. 42) of 1923. His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that, subject to what follows, this proposal constitutes a binding obligation on their part.2. I shall be glad if you will inform your Ministers that, when they agreed to the proposal made to them by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it was pointed out that before the bonds were issued legislation would be necessary, both in this country and in the Free State, in order to satisfy certain financial conditions. I hope very shortly to be able to send, for the information of your Ministers, a copy of the Bill which the Treasury is preparing for submission to Parliament. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be glad to be furnished with their views on this Bill, and also to be given an opportunity of considering a draft of the measure which your Ministers propose to submit to the Dail.I have, &amp;c. (Signed)        DEVONSHIRE.Governor-GeneralT. M. Healy, Esq., K.C., &amp;c,    &amp;c,    &amp;c.
