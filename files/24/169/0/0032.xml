[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1924.SECRET.CP. 531 (24).CABINET.IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE, 1923..Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office, showing the action taken with regard to the Resolutions of the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923, in continuation of Cmd. 2115.L. S. A.Colonial Office, December 3, 1924.Resolutions of Imperial Economic Conference, 1923. (See Cmd. 1990.)The position of the late Government in regard to these Resolutions was set out in Cmd. 2115. The following statement shows subsequent developments, following the arrangement in Cmd. 2115 : (A.) Resolutions and Proposals considered in connection with &quot; TheFinance Act, 1924.&quot;1. Tariff Preference.A message explaining the late Governments attitude on Preference, in general terms, was sent to the Dominions on the 25th March. The Union of South Africa put certain questions which the Government felt unable to answer prior to the Budget statement. Australia and New Zealand made strong representations in favour of adopting the Conference proposals. The decision of the late Government was set out in Mr. Snowden&apos;s Budget statement on the 29th April. The definite proposals laid before the Imperial Economic Conference were brought before the House of Commons as resolutions, discussed on the 17th, 18th and 19th June,.and, so far as they were put to the vote, rejected by varying majorities. Copies of the debates were sent to the Dominions and Southern Rhodesia.Australia and New Zealand (see also under (D) 3 below) have since decided to increase the proportion of British manufacture, &amp;c, required in order to qualify goods for Preferential Tariff Rates.In view of representations received from certain of the West Indian Colonies in regard to the dropping of the Conference proposal to stabilise the amount of preference on Empire sugar imported into this country, the late Government authorised a declaration to the local Governments, after the decision of Parliament had been taken, to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to leave the Colonial Legislatures &quot; equal freedom to decide in the interests of the Colony what rate of tariff preference can be accorded to the United Kingdom in future, and that the matter would be left to the decision of unofficial members.&quot; Authority was given in October to make this declaration public in answer to enquiries.2. Shipping Taxation.Provision was made in Section 31 of &quot; The Finance Act, 1924,&quot; for the extension to the Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories of the provisions [12355] b
&apos;-&quot;:n&apos; -,;&quot;:;v.,:.-v-&apos;-;&quot;;-&apos;:;:      ,:&apos;    &quot; :&apos;w      -2of Section 18 of &quot; The Finance Act, 1923,&quot; which applied as between this country and foreign countries (exemption of shipping from taxation on the basis of reciprocity). This information was sent to the Dominions and Australian States by despatch on the 30th June, but no reply has been received on this particular point. (Canada is principally concerned with this recommendation; the- other Dominions, Australian States, and the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories which levy Income Tax are more concerned with the other part of the Conference proposals under this head, as to which see (C) 7 below.)3. Immunity of State Enterprises.Mr. Snowden announced in his Budget statement that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, while generally favourable, would prefer to postpone further consideration of the question for a year, during which time the views of the Dominion Govern-ments would be sought. A despatch in this sense was sent to the Dominions, Southern Rhodesia and Australian States on the 7th August, and to the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories on the 13th September. The Irish Free State has replied to the effect that they are unable to reach a decision on the question at present; the Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia have agreed to take the required legislative action, provided that other parts of the Empire do so; New Zealand agrees to the proposals, and legislation will not be required; no other replies have yet been received.(B.) Resolutions requiring other Legislative Provision. 1. Co-operation in Financial Assistance to Imperial Development.Legislation has been passed to give effect to the resolution (Section 2 of &quot; The Trade Facilities Act, 1924 &quot;). A Committee (composed of unofficial representatives of the Treasury, Board of Trade, Colonial Office, and, when Indian questions are concerned, India Office) has been set up to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on applications received under this section, and full information as to the scheme and the Committee&apos;s requirements has been sent to the Dominions, Southern Rhodesia and the Colonies and Protectorates. An application for assistance has been received from New Zealand in respect of the Arapuni hydroelectric development scheme, and has been referred to the Committee. The Union of South Africa does not propose to take advantage of the scheme,.2. Carriage of Goods by Sea.The required legislation has been passed (&quot; Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924 &quot;), and is to come into force on the 1st January, 1925. The Dominions have been informed. The Commonwealth of Australia has passed similar legislation: New Zealand has declined to introduce further legislation and correspondence is still proceeding on this question. The attitude of the other Dominions is not yet known. A despatch to the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories on the subject is now under consideration in consultation with the Board of Trade.3. Co-operation for Technical Research and Information.Since the Conference, the scheme for the reorganisation of the Imperial Institute and its amalgamation with the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau has been modified, at the wish of the majority of. the Dominions and in view of the offer of Lord Cowdray to give  5,000 a year for five years, to include provision for the retention of the Exhibition Galleries of the Institute. Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and Newfoundland have agreed to provide additional contributions for this purpose : the Union of South Africa and India have agreed to contribute only the sums proposed at the Conference, on the understanding that their contributions will not be utilised for the maintenance of the Galleries: the Irish Free State has declined to contribute at all. Guarantees of contributions have been received from Southern Rhodesia and from the Colonies and Protectorates to make up the sum of  8,000 agreed upon by the Conference. The larger Colonies, &amp;c, have since been invited to provide further contributions to make up their proportion of the additional sum required for the retention of the Galleries. A Bill to give effect to the scheme as modified was introduced and passed the House of Lords with some amendment. It awaits reintroduction into, the new Parliament. Full information as to the position has been sent to the Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates, and Mandated Territories.
(C.) Resolutions requiring Administrative Action.1. Oversea Settlement.The Dominions have been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the recommendations of the Conference and will continue to give effect by administrative action to the policy embodied in &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot; Several schemes have been completed or are under negotiation, particularly as regards Canada and Australia.2. Imperial Preference in Public Contracts.The Colonial Office have urged the Treasury in official (and semi-official) correspondence to give effect to the promise in Cmd. 2115 that a statement of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this question would be made in Parliament; but no reply has been received and no such statement was made on behalf of the late Government.3. Commercial, Diplomatic and Consular Services.The necessary instructions have been issued to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives concerned; and copies have been sent to the Dominions, Southern Rhodesia and the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, with a statement as to the other parts of the Resolution on the lines set out in Cmd. 2115.4. Commercial Travellers&apos; Samples.. It has been suggested to the Dominions and Southern Rhodesia that informal reciprocal arrangements should be made, where such do not already exist, for the free admission of such samples, on certain conditions, subject to re-exportation. Such arrangements are already in force as regards New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State : Southern Rhodesia has expressed willingness to enter into such an arrangement and the necessary instructions have been given to the Customs authorities in this country. Canada did not wish to modify its present rules, which do not accord complete reciprocity, and His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioner in Canada has been authorised to discuss with the Canadian authorities informally certain points which arise.5. Statistics.The Dominions and Southern Rhodesia have been informed that a revised scheme of statistics is in course of preparation, and the Board of Trade have the matter in hand.6. Imperial Shipping Committee.The Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories have been informed as in Cmd. 2115.7. Shipping Taxation. &apos; ,The Dominions and Australian States have been invited to consider the possibility of taking the measures recommended by the Conference to afford relief from double taxation on shipping. New Zealand has expressed willingness to take the action proposed: Queensland has declined: Tasmania considers it desirable that the question should be discussed at one of the periodical Conferences of State Premiers: no other replies have been received. As regards the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories which levy Income Tax, a despatch is now under consideration giving detailed information to them as to the measures necessary to enable them to give effect to the recommendations of the Conference.[12355] b 24. Import and Export of Livestock.A draft Bill to give effect to this Conference Resolution has been prepared and was sent to the Dominions and Southern Rhodesia for concurrence on the 3rd September. Eeplies accepting the proposed Bill have been received from Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State, and Southern Rhodesia.
8. Air Communication.A scheme for interchange of information has been sent to the Dominions; and has been accepted by Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa. A reply received from Newfoundland states that the subject is of little practical concern there, as no aviation exists at present.9. Wireless.The late Government, after considerable correspondence with the Dominions, decided to adopt the principle of the &quot; Donald &quot; Committee&apos;s Report, namely, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should own the stations in this country for communicating with the Dominions, and preliminary steps were taken for the erection or completion of the required high-power stations. The position was then altered to some extent by information received from Mr. Marconi as to the progress made with the new invention of &quot; beam &quot; transmission, and His Majesty&apos;? Government decided, while continuing work on the main high-power station at Rugby, to arrange with the Marconi Company for the erection of a &quot; beam &apos;&apos; station in this country suitable for communication with Canada, and capable of extension to serve the other Dominions; such station to be erected by the Marconi Company and to be taken over by the Government if proved to be working satisfactorily. This decision was announced in Parliament on the 23rd July. A contract with the Marconi Company was executed and approved by the House of Commons on the 1st August. At the same time it was ascertained that Australia and the Union of South Africa wished to accept an offer made by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the-erection of &quot;beam&quot; stations to communicate with those Dominions, and that, pending a thorough trial of the &quot; beam &quot; system, Australia (definitely) and the Union (probably) had decided to suspend all work on a high-power station. These decisions are not acceptable to the Admiralty from a strategic point of view, and representations have been made to the Dominions as to the defects of the &quot; beam &apos;&apos; system from the strategic aspect. New Zealand has not yet decided on the policy to be adopted. Arrange-ments as to charges and division of revenue are being made with Australia and the Union.of South Africa, and action is being taken towards the erection of stations . here; some delay has been caused through difficulty over the sites for the &quot;beam &quot; stations. In accordance with the recommendation in the report of the &quot; Donald &quot; Committee, a scheme for the establishment of a wireless system for the Colonies involving principally the development of existing or erection of new Admiralty wireless stations in various Colonies, was prepared for and considered by the Imperial Communications Committee. The scheme affects certain Dominions as well as Colonies, and an enquiry has been sent to them as to whether they would be prepared to co-operate in giving effect to the scheme if adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.\10. Imperial Communications Committee.The Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories have been informed as in Cmd. 2115, and effect has been given to the resolution in practice when opportunity has arisen. ,11. Atlantic Cable.12. Preference to British Cable and Wireless Companies.The Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories have been informed as in Cmd. 2115, and the principles of the resolutions have been accepted by Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa. The Canadian Govern-ment have pointed out, however, that they have difficulty in giving effect to No. 11, by reason of an existing agreement between the British Post Office and the Canadian Pacific Railway giving exclusive rights to the latter to receive messages transmitted by the Imperial Cable, and precluding the Canadian National Telegraphs from handling such traffic.13. Patents.The Dominions and Southern Rhodesia have been informed as in Cmd. 2115. In a circular of the 12th April the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories (who had previously been informed of the recommendations of the British Empire Patent Conference) were urged, in the interests of uniformity, to adopt the provisional scheme for an Empire-wide patent, and were supplied with a model form
of legislation for the purpose. In many cases legislation has been, or is being, enacted on lines approved by the Board of Trade, and in some others the local authorities consider that effect can be given to the recommendation without further legislation.14. Economic Defence.The Dominions have been informed as in Cmd. 2115.15. International Conference on Customs Formalities.The Convention drawn up at the Conference has been ratified on behalf of this country, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and the Colonies not possessing responsible government and Protectorates. The Colonies and Protectorates have been asked to take legislative action, where necessary, to give effect to it.16. Co-operation in Technical Research.A despatch has been sent to the Dominions and Southern Rhodesia making certain recommendations for such co-operation; replies, welcoming the proposals, have been received from New Zealand and the Union of South Africa. A despatch has also been sent to certain Colonies and Protectorates inviting attention to the desirability of co-operation and exchange of information, not only between institu-tions in the Empire, but among research workers, especially on problems affecting tropical agriculture.17. Immunity of State Enterprises (immunity of State-owned ships).The Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories have been informed as in Cmd. 2115.18. Forestry.The most important of the recommendations of the Ottawa Forestry Conference of 1923 has been given effect to by the establishment of the Imperial Forestry Institute at Oxford. The Dominions, Southern Rhodesia and the Australian States have been invited to support the Institute by sending officers there for training and research work. Replies have been received from New Zealand, the Irish Free State, Southern Rhodesia, Victoria and Tasmania indicating that it is not possible to take such action at present, but that it is hoped that it may be possible to do so at a later date. The Colonies and Protectorates principally interested have agreed to con-tribute towards the Forestry Institute and to make full use of the facilities afforded; the remainder have been fully informed as to the position.The other recommendations of the Ottawa- Conference are under consideration, and it is hoped that it will shortly be possible to send a comprehensive despatch to the Colonies and Protectorates concerned on the subject.19. Imperial Economic Committee.On the 19th June a message was sent to the Dominions to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government had given further consideration to the question of the proposed Committee, and would suggest that the Committee should be set up with one definite reference, in the first instance, so framed as to exclude the Tariff issue, if the Dominions would co-operate. The membership should be as proposed at the Economic Conference, with the following reference : &quot; To consider the possibility of improving the methods of preparing for market and of marketing within the United Kingdom the food products of the oversea parts of the Empire, with a view to increasing the consumption of such products in the United Kingdom and promoting the interests both of producers and consumers,&quot; the Committee to be instructed to concentrate its attention first on meat and fruit. The Dominions all agreed to the appointment of such a Committee, though Newfoundland would not wish to be represented. Definite proposals for setting up the Committee were drawn up and placed before the late Government, but no decision was reached before their resignation, and the matter received the early attention of the present Government. The scheme was accepted in principle, subject to the addition of the words &quot; in preference to imports from foreign countries &quot; after the words &quot; products in the United Kingdom.&quot;   The necessary telegram was sent to the Dominions on the
25th November. Sir Halford Mackinder was suggested as Chairman. It is pro-posed that two representatives of the Colonies and Protectorates should be appointed to the Committee one official member and one unofficial, specially acquainted with the parts of the Empire in which the particular product under consideration is produced.(D.) Resolutions on which no Action is required on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.1. Trade Catalogues.In reply to despatches forwarding the Conference Resolution, Canada, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Southern Rhodesia have stated that in practice they are giving effect to the resolution. The attention of the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories has also been called to this resolution.2. Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments.The Dominions and Australian States which have not already passed reciprocal legislation have been again invited to do so. Replies promising to introduce the required legislation at a favourable opportunity have been received from the Union of South Africa, New South Wales and Queensland. All Colonies and Protectorates have legislated on the subject, and Part II of &quot; The Imperial Administration of Justice Act, 1920,&quot; has been applied to them by Order in Council. The legislation in every case contains provision for its extension to judgments made in other parts of the Empire, and in Circular of the 2nd July, the Colonies have been instructed to arrange for such extension in the case of any other part with which reciprocity in this matter may be desirable.3. Valuation of Goods for Customs Duty Purposes.The Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, which have not done so, have been invited to adopt one of the tWo alternative forms proposed. New Zealand has suggested some modifications of the form, in view of the decision to increase the proportion of British manufacture, &amp;c, required in order to qualify goods for preference under the New Zealand Tariff, and similar modifications will be required in the case of the Commonwealth of Australia, where a similar decision has been taken.4. Empire Currency and Exchange.The Conference recommendations on this head primarily concern Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa. No official communication has been received from the Governments concerned, but it is understood from press reports that certain action is being taken by the Commonwealth Government to enable it to assist in dealing with the difficulty caused by fluctuation of the exchange rate, and that the Union Government propose to appoint a Committee to consider the possibility of restoring the gold standard.5. WorkmeWs Compensation.The Canadian Government have been asked to call the attention of the Canadian Provinces to the recommendations in Resolutions I and II, with which their practice is not at present wholly in accord. No further action has been taken as regards Resolution III.Colonial Office, December 1, 1924.o
