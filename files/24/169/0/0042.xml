[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1924.SECRET.CP. 541 (24).SPECIAL REPORT ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 111   November 1924.DURING the period covered by this Report the number of persons registered as unemployed has decreased by 12,637. A sharp rise in the first week of the period was followed by a steady downward movement of the figures during the succeeding three weeks, when the registers decreased by 37,431.A small part of the decrease may be attributed to seasonal causes, such as the usual slight improvement due to Christmas trade, but it will be seen from Part II of the Report that improved conditions are reported from certain of the principal industries. In particular, a marked decrease in the registers in Lancashire has followed the extension of working hours in the cotton trade, and the resumption of full-time working in a number of collieries has had a similar effect in Wales.The improvement in the motor manufacturing industry has been maintained and signs are apparent of better employment in general engineering. In the iron and steel and shipbuilding industries little change is reported.&apos; Members of the Cabinet will find on page 8 of the Report a table showing the number of men employed on works for the relief of unemployment.Previous attempts have been made to obtain figures on the same subject. But these are the first that can be regarded as substantially accurate.I would, however, warn my colleagues against any public use of them without qualification, as such use may prove to be very misleading. It is for this reason that I have not published them in the &quot; Labour Gazette.&quot;Some of the important qualifications are to be found in the footnotes to page -8,. which should be read. It will also be remembered that the figures given for any particular date are the result of investigations and negotiations which, may have been set on foot weeks, or even months, previously.Subject, however, to these qualifications, the information will, I think, be found interesting.A.

II.-POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.Some improvement was shown during the period under review, but the industry still remained depressed. More pits were closed in the Northumberland and Durham coal-fields, but with those still working there was a slight increase in the average number of days worked per week as compared with October. In the South Yorkshire coal-field the demand for domestic coal was maintained and the export trade was reported as steady. In the North-Western Counties the seasonal demand for coal had no appreciable effect on unemployment, which showed an increase in certain centres. In the Midlands area much short-time was worked. The position was worst in the South Staffordshire coal-field, but a further decline took place in North Staffordshire, particularly at Longton and Newcastle-under-Lyme. On the other hand, no unemployment existed among skilled workers at Hanley, and conditions were satisfactory at Chesterfield. Improvement was shown in the South-Western Counties, and, with the exception of one colliery, a general resumption of work took place in the Bristol district. Miners were better employed in the Gloucester area, and in the Kingswood district pits again commenced operations and re-engaged the bulk of the men previously unemployed. In Scotland there was a slight increase in shipments, and employment improved in practically all districts. In the Welsh coal-fields the position became more stable and full-time working was resumed at a number of collieries, causing a net decrease in the unemployment registers of about 12,000 men. At Abertillery, where working was previously intermittent, three collieries closed down, but the remaining collieries were working fairly regularly.IRON AND STEEL.This industry still remained depressed, though in some districts more optimistic feelings are entertained that the prolonged stagnation will shortly be eased. In the Cleveland area a further furnace was put in blast, and forty furnaces out of seventy are now working. A firm in South Bank received an order for 24,000 tons of steel rails and sleepers for the Uganda Railway in British East Africa. In the Scunthorpe and Frodingham district employment remained bad. In the Sheffield area rolling mills were slightly busier, but billets were in poor request. In the crucible and general tool steel branches, the activity previously reported has now subsided. The demand for steel sheets was maintained, but the amount of work available was quite inadequate co absorb the large numbers of unemployed workers engaged at normal times in this branch of the steel industry. In the North-Western Counties little improvement was shown except in the Barrow area where certain new orders were received and the furnaces were more active than they have been for some time past. In this district an improvement was also reported in the haematite pig-iron trade. In the Midlands area there was little change, improvement being reported from some places and :3creased unemployment and considerable short-time working from others. In Scotland the demand for light and galvanised sheet iron was much better, but suspensions of workmen occurred at Airdrie and Motherwell. In Wales the activity of that part of this industry (mainly in West Wales) which is dependent upon the tin-plate trade was checked owing to the sudden set-back in the tin-plate industry. Steelworks engaged in general trade continued to be in a depressed condition at Port Talbot; the position at Ebbw Vale was unsettled; and no improvement was reported from Merthyr. A number of employees at Swansea were discharged. In the North the depression at Plint continued and is now acute. Employment at Wrexham remained good.TIN-PLATE TRADE.A decline in the activity of this industry was anticipated, but the sudden depression which occurred was surprising. Manufacturers are still hopeful that the set-back is merely temporary, and they have therefore continued at work on stock production. The effect has been felt most severely at Swansea and Llanelly, whose unemployment registers have increased in consequence.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.There is little change to report in this industry and the position generally remained depressed.  On the North-East Coast a few contracts for new tonnage have
been placed, but little diminution in unemployment has so far resulted. At Hull it was reported that plenty of new and repair work was on hand. There was some improvement on the Merseyside and at Barrow, but the effect on unemployment has not yet been felt to any degree. In the South-Western Counties the shipyards at Avonmouth were very busy, but at Falmouth men were discharged on the completion of repair work. In Scotland the tonnage launched during the month reached the high figure of 58,000 tons, the bulk of which was built on the Clyde. Fair numbers of new contracts are reported, but the tonnage involved is smaller, and unless fresh orders are received it is anticipated that unemployment will increase. In the Welsh ship-repairing centres improvement in employment was reported, except at Port Talbot and Pembroke, where work was slack. Employment was bad at Flint and Holyhead.ENGINEERING.Motor and Cycle Engineering. The improvement in this industry continued, and full time was being worked by nearly all large firms in the Midlands area. At Birmingham the motor trade was very active and the motor-cycle section was working at full pressure. Employment at Coventry was better than for some time past, and at Derby and Nottingham all firms were.busy. A marked improvement was also shown at Redditch. The Morris Motor Company&apos;s works at Oxford still made good progress. On the other hand, little change was reported from Lancashire. In the London area, firms at Acton were reported to be working at full pressure.General Engineering. Some slight improvement was shown in this industry, both in textile engineering and in other sections. In the North-Eastern Counties a slight but definite improvement was recorded. Tool manufacturers were better engaged, and there was an increased demand for agricultural and printing-machinery. At Elswick and Leeds orders for locomotives have been secured. In the North-Western Counties improvement was shown in textile engineering, but in other sections of the industry there were no signs of any development or of absorption of any considerable number of skilled engineers at present unemployed. In the Midlands area there was some improvement, but unemployment still remained heavy. A demand for skilled workers was apparent in some places, chiefly at Aston, Birmingham, Coventry, Leicester and Rugby. An improvement in electrical engineering was recorded at Cradley Heath and Stafford. Textile engineering was, however, depressed at Long Eaton, but makers of hosiery machinery at Nottingham were busy. The position in the South-Western Counties was reported to be favour-able, and a slight improvement took place at Newbury, while additional workers were engaged by the Great Western Railway Company, Swindon. In the South-Eastern Counties no marked change took place, although the level of employment was maintained. Highly skilled mechanics were in demand in various parts of this area. At Kingston and Bedford work was brisk, and overtime was being worked at the latter place. Some slackness was reported at Braintree and Colchester. In Scotland a number of: foreign orders were secured, and an order for 35 locomotives for the New Zealand Railway Company was obtained by a Glasgow firm. Activity was reported from Johnstone in the machine tool trade. In South Wales dulness was reported generally, although at Ebbw Vale foundries were on full time, and the position at Newport was good. At Aberdare foundries were, however, working on short time, and at Llanelly work was intermittent. Iron foundries at Risca were idle. At Port Talbot trade was affected by the depression in mining and tin-plate industries, and work was slack at Pembroke Dock. In North Wales, particularly at Holyhead and Newtown, the industry was depressed, and employment decreased at Flint foundries.TEXTILES. \)Cotton. Definite improvement is reported in this industry, and unemployment has shown a substantial decrease. The Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation (American Section) have decided to extend the working hours per week from 32 to 39 . The reduction in the numbers of unemployed operatives was most pronounced in the cotton-spinning centres rather than in those where yarn is woven, but there are indications that the improvement is spreading to the weaving centres. The Egyptian Section, in which employment has previously continued to be good, showed some slight falling off.
Woollens and Worsteds.-There was little change to report in this industry. The continued increase in wool values is an unsettling factor. In the Yorkshire woollen towns there was an increase in the amount of short-time working. Employ-ment was good in the South-Western Counties. In Scotland employment with wool-spinning firms at Greenock and Paisley, and with tweed manufacturers at Peebles and other border towns, was good. In Wales employment was rather better in Cardiganshire, but there was a decline at Newtown and Llanidloes.Hosiery.-Employment in this industry was slack and no improvement was shown on the whole. This is attributed to the recent mild weather and to a shortage of yarn in one or two centres. Trade was fair at Nottingham, and at Leicester, where a slight improvement occurred, employment was irregular, except among cotton hosiery workers. In Scotland the position was slightly less satisfactory, although trade was good at Aberdeen and Greenock. Short time was worked at Dumfries, and hours were reduced at Hawick. Kilmarnock reported a slight improvement.Lace. Unemployment was still heavy in this industry. The levers&apos; section at Beeston showed a further decline, but there was a revival in the curtain section. Employment was poor at Newark and Long Eaton and at Nottingham. An improve-ment was reported from the Irvine Valley in Scotland, where factories returned to full-time working.Silk. The position in this industry showed little change. Employment was very irregular, and there was a considerable amount of under-empioyment at Macclesfield, Cheadle and Leek. Employment in the artificial silk trade at Coventry and Derby was good.Jute. This industry continues to prosper, and employment was good at Dundee, Perth and other centres.Carpets. Employment has practically returned to normal conditions at Kidderminster, and at Keighley works were on full time. Slackness in the trade is mainly confined to the chenille carpet trade, in which women are largely engaged.BUILDING, BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.The activity in the building trade was maintained and skilled workers were still in demand, except for painting and decorating, where the usual seasonal slackness continued. There was still a fair amount of unemployment among unskilled labour. Shortage of materials was reported in some places. In the brick and tile industry employment was generally good, and the fire-brick trade at Stafford and Stourbridge remained busy.CLOTHING.The seasonal depression in this industry still continued. In the West End of London the demand for fresh workers for dressmaking (wholesale and retail) and ladies&apos; tailoring has practically ceased, but employers had not commenced to dismiss staff, although in the suburbs discharges had already taken place. In the East End wholesale tailoring was busy on men&apos;s work and slack on ladies&apos; work. In the Midlands a slight improvement was shown and fustian cutters at Newcastle-under-Lyme were well employed. Trade was still slack in corset manufacture, and short time was still worked in the shirt and collar trade.BOOT AND SHOE.Little change occurred in this industry and heavy unemployment still prevailed. Short time was largely worked at Kettering and trade was quiet at Rushden. An improvement was shown at Stafford and Derby and employment was good at Bilston and Bromsgrove. In the Bristol district the depression continued and much short time was worked. Employment was slack in the slipper trade at Bacup and Rawtenstall. No improvement was recorded at Norwich. At Hackney trade was quiet, but employment was reported to be good at Tottenham.POTTERY.The tendency to improvement in this industry was maintained. Short time work in the porcelain section declined and trade in the sanitary and fire-clay section continued good.   At Longton considerable improvement was shown and there was a
slight improvement at Hanley. The position at Burslem and Stoke-on-Trent was steady and the improvement was maintained. At Newcastle-under-Lyme there was a slight decline, but on the whole firms were well occupied. The china trade remained good at Derby and Worcester.DOCKS.Employment continued to fluctuate in this industry, *but there was a slight decline in employment generally. In the South-Western area increased activity was reported from Bristol and Avonmouth Docks, but further seasonal discharges from the Great Western Railway Co. (Marine Department) occurred at Weymouth. There was increased unemployment among dockers at West Hartlepool due to the termination of the Baltic timber importing season, and dockers in Wales were like-wise affected, due to the pitwood season drawing to a close. At Liverpool Docks there was an increase in the freightage and the volume of work was maintained.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.(See note on page 1.)The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes out in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade F facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which&apos; State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned.It should be noted that in view of recent modifications in the scope of the table the figures given cannot properly be compared with those previously announced in Parliament in similar connections. The figures given for November 1923, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.Bridge Schemes assisted by the of certain road the Ministry of Exchanges fromWorks assisted by-1.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t In addition to the figures quoted, the average number of men employed during November 1924 on the Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) was 1,785 as compared with 1,497 during November 1923.1 These figures indicate men employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.

The Scheme, however, closed to new applications in December 1922.[124121 CIY. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the &quot;Dominion Authorities concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain of the Dominions, have also been assisted. An extension of this assistance to other organisations is under consideration.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of October (with the corresponding figures for October of last year) and for the seven months ended the 31st October, 1924 and 1923 respectively, are set out in the following Table : -Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The empire settlement Act, 1922.&quot;

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

(Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.

(C.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund.1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Year.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (b) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2)j by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.) England and Wales.
