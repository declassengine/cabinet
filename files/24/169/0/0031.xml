inIS E C R E T.---------, CABINET.C.P. .530 (24).GENEVA OPIUM CONFERENCE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.In paragraph. 7 of his memorandum No.C.P.520(24) of the 2nd of December the Secretary of State for India observes that the redraft of Article 8 erf the Hague Convention,  (proposed by the American Delegation) is a matter for the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The proposal is that the smoking of opium, in territories In which it is still- permitted under the Convention, should be abolished in 10 years by reducing imports of raw opium by 10$ per annum.I am strongly of opinion that this proposal cannot be accepted.     It is, as my predecessor said, impossible to force upon reluctant communities in our Colonies measures which their Governments, after full inquiry hold to be not only impracticable, but even dangerous to our relations with the Native Rulers and peoples.When the Hague Convention was signed there was a reasonable prospect that within a, measurable time the smoking of opium could be -practically eradicated.     In the last few years however the growth of the. poppy In China has Increased to an immense extent, and there Is no indication that the Chinese are likely to abandon their ingrained habit of smoking.     The result is that Hong-Kong (which for all practical purposes is geographically and raeisIhJ
an integral part of China) is flooded with illicit opium, and it is now beginning to find its way into the Straits Settlements in alarmingly increasing amounts.The difficulties of dealing with the opium smugglers are enormous, and even as things are at present our Ear Eastern Governments have the greatest difficulty in hooping smuggling within bounds,   The arbitrary restriction of supplies of Government opium would inevitably lead to a greatly increased demand for illicit opium..   There are practioally unlimited supplies available in China and the powers of the preventive services would be taxed beyond endurance.   The result would be a complete breakdown of the present systems of control (which are based on a Government monopoly supplying high grade opium at an artificially high price with a view to restricting consumption; coupled with very drastic measures for dealing with opium smugglers).   The possibility of improving on the present systems has been most carefully enquired into by strong local Committees, whose findings have been endorsed by the Governors of the territories concerned.In Malaya (where the problem differs somewhat from that in Hong Kong,- owing to its distance from China) the local Governments are convinced that the only policy which holds out any prospect of ultimate success is one involving control over the Individual smoker and they have evolved a carefully thought out scheme designed to lead up to a system of registration and rationing of smokers.The Governor and High Commissioner are emphatically ofiopinion that any premature attempt at an arbitrary reduction of the amount of/
opium legitimately placed on sale (such as would he involved by the American proposal) would prodfuo-e the most deplorable results.In Hong Kong (one of the largest and busiest ports of the world between which and the mainland of China, it is estimated that ten or twelve thousand Chinese pass daily) the Governor is convinced that a system of registration and rationing of smokers could never be effectively enforced and that in existing circumstances nothing more can be done to strengthen the measures of control already adopted.     He has however declared again and again that he is prepared to close down the Government monopoly completely so soon as the growth and use of the poppy in China has been effectively suppressed,In these circumstances I repeat that it is impossible for us to accept any proposal for the final abolition of opium smoking within any fixed period, until there has been a radical change in the conditions in China,,The matter has already been dealt with exhaustively in memoranda for the late Cabinet by my predecessor. I will therefore say no more now than that I adhere fully, to the views expressed by him.If it is necessary, as it may well be, that an effort should be made to placate American opinion I would urge, as my predecessor urged, that the British Delegate should be definitely instructed to take the initiative by proposing that the league should send out a Commission with an American Chairman to examine the
ownquestion of opium smoking both in our/Far Eastern Possessions and those of other countries and to report to the League what further measures of repression can be taken without doing much more harm than good,,-    Such a proposal t;ould in my opinion demonstrate to the rorld that we are honestly doing our best in very difficult circumstances.Clnta.)   I.S..A.Colonial Office. December 5th.1924.
