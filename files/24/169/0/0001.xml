rOCTJxSI IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS:j BRITC MAJESTY&apos;S OOVERHKEBT&apos;.J) RET. 501  (24),C A 3 I H E T,IAW OF PROPERTY (POSTPOKBMEKT) BILLo LAV/ OF PROPERTY (AMENDMENT) BILL.Memorandum by the lord Chancellor,,Referring to ray Memorandum of November 13th,, 1924, (C,P,.488(24)), I circulate a copy of the Amending Bill as introduced last Session, in which I propose to make the following amendments :-(l) I propose to strike out three provisions:(a) that relating to implied covenants in &quot; x conveyances subject to rents (See pages 15-20):(b) that relating to relief against notice to effect decorative repairs    (See page 20):(o) that relating to equitable apportionment of rants and remedies for non-payment of rent on broach of covenant    (See pages 28-31),, The reason for the deletion of these provisions is that, however   beneficial the proposals may be, they are not changes in the law necessary in order to enable satisfactory consolidation measures to be prepared, and were on that ground not included amongst the .recommend-at ions of Mir. Justice Romer&apos;3 Committee,     If the Billis to be taken by both Houses on trust and passed before Christmas, I feel that Parliament cannot be asked to make changes in the law which are beyond those strictly required for the purposes of consolidation,,(2) A few amendments of a drafting nature will have to bo made to meet points which have been taken since the introduction of the Bill, mse of lords, aNovember 20th. 1924, \(Intd,)   C,
Jj%W Of Property (Amendment).[H.L.]MEMORANDUM.The objects of this Bill are (1) To correct errors and supply omissions in the Law of Property Act, 1922, which a further scrutiny has disclosed.(2) To facilitate the consolidation of the statute law relating to real property from the year 1285.This consolidation will collect the law under intelli-gible headings, thus making the study of each branch a comparatively simple matter. All the Acts passed before 1922 have to be taken into account when reproducing the older law, and without some amendment of them the existing law could not be reproduced.There are two classes of cases to, be 4ealt with First, amendments of the, law on minor details to remedy the errors and omissions mentioned above. These are set out in the Second Schedule and in Part I. of each of the next six Schedules to the Bill.Secondly, amendments intended to prepare the way for consolidation by removing doubts. These are set out in Part II. of each of the Schedules from the Third to the Seventh and in the Eighth Schedule.This treatment will lighten the task of dealing with the Consohdating Bills in Committee, whjoh, might other-wise have been stupendous. A separate Schedule in this Bill is allotted to each of the Consolidating Bills; the order adopted in each Schedule is that which has been adopted in the Consolidating Bill to, wlricji the Schedule relates,The Act of 1922 effected the repeal of a large number of enactments; the provisions containing these repeals will, however,&apos; be replaced by the, CoflsoMating Bills before they come into, force, &apos;a,nd It has, been thought convenient&apos;with a view to, subsequent statute law revision to collect these repeals into a Schedule,   (See Schedule I.)(194) a
Enfranchisement oe Copyholds and Conversion oe perpetually Renewable Leaseholds into Long Terms.(See Second Schedule).As these matters are transitional the parts of the Act of 1922 relating thereto will not be repealed or reproduced in any Consolidating Bill, but will have effect subject to the amendments contained in the Second Schedule to this Bill.Paragraph 1 preserves the effect of the acceptance of the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds, &amp;c, by a Member of Parliament.Paragraph 2 provides for the safe custody of manorial documents.Paragraph 3 makes various amendments in order to carry out the principle, laid down in the Twelfth Schedule to the principal Act, that the person beneficially interested is to take the legal estate in enfranchised land.Paragraph 4 amends the scheme contained in the Fifteenth Schedule to the principal Act for ascertaining the amount of the additional rent made payable in lieu of fines and other payments on the renewal of a perpetually renewable lease.In certain cases, in order to do justice to the lessees, an actuarial calculation will be necessary. This is provided for.Law oe Property and Conveyancing. (See Third Schedule).The proposed amendments in this Schedule are mainly of a drafting character or relate to mere improve-ments in machinery, but attention may be called to the following :-(1) Party structures and open spaces do not lend themselves readily to the treatment imposed by the Third Schedule of the Act of 1922 on land held in undivided shares. Hence provision is made (Paragraphs 3 and 40) for severance of
14 &amp; 15 Gbo. 5.]iii the land and for giving effect to the beneficial interests by means of easements :(2) Power is given (Paragraph 7 (4)) to the court, where it refuses to make an order for specific performance, to order the repayment of any deposit paid by a purchaser :(3) The covenants usually given in conveyances subject to rents will be implied under paragraph 10.   This will greatly shorten such conveyances :(4) Provision is made (Paragraphs 17 and 41) to enable a subsequent or puisne mortgagee, who does not have the custody of the title deeds, to obtain priority for his mortgagee, made after the Act, according to the date of its registration as a land charge. A puisne mortgage made before the Act will, in favour of a purchaser in good faith without notice, remain liable to be postponed as an equitable interest unless it is registered as a land charge :(5) Under paragraph 26 the law formerly applicable to dealings with life interests and reversions in the proceeds of land held on trust for sale and other personal estate is made to apply to dealings in life interests and reversions in settled land. By paragraph 27 it is proposed to authorise the appointment of a trust cor-poration to keep a register of the notices received :(6) By s. 78 (1) of the Act of 1922 the power of the court to give relief to a lessee against forfeiture for breach of covenant was extended to the case of an assignment, &amp;c, without licence, but an exception was made in the case of assignments, &amp;c, to limited companies.The Bill proposes (Paragraph 30) to abolish this exception which rests on no principle.(7) By paragraph 31 power is given to the court to grant relief to a lessee where notice has been served requiring him to effect internal de-corative repairs which ought not to be attended to until the last year of the term,
Law of Property [14 .&amp; 15 Gep. 5.] 1 (Arjimdmeniy.Settled Land.(See Fourth Schedule).The amendments proposed by this Schedule (apart frpm altpratipns in language necessitate by the amend-ments of law effected by the Act of J922) are insignificant. So far as they dp not consist of mere improvements in machinery they may be thus summarised : (1) Express confirmation of the decision in Be Monckton, [1917] 1 Ch. 224, as to the meaning of &quot; settlement&quot; (Paragraph 1 in Part I. of the Fqurth Schedule). (2) The procedure, on the appointment or discharge of a trustee of the settlement, in relation to vesting instruments is varied : Paragraph 3.(3) Power is conferred to exchange an easement for another easement, to avoid cross sales of easements : Paragraph 4.(4) Express gc-wer is given to, grant licences as to user of land : Paragraph 6.(5) The legal estate in settled land is not to vest in the&apos; trustee in bankruptcy of the tenant for life but only his beneficial interest: Paragraph 9.(6), Aii assignee of a life interest only is precluded from taking the documents relating to the title tp the settled land : Paragraph 10!.&apos;Trustees.(See Fifth Schedule.)The amendments proposed do not call for any special mention, except in the following cases :-(1) The statutory provisions relating to bearersecurities have been brought into, line with the modern practice: Paragraph 2: (2) The power of a trustee when going abroad to delegate (Paragraph 8) follows the lines, in-dicated by recent war legislation :(3) The P04tiop of a trustee who, obtains notice of . .     a fact by- reason of acting in another trust is defined. (Paragraph 9),:
(4) The jurisdiction of the High Court and of the Judge in Lunacy respectively in relation to lunatics who are trustees has been denned: Paragraph 12.Land Charges. (See Sixth Schedule.)After 1925, annuities affecting land, not protected by Settled Land Act Trustees, will be capable of regis-tration as land charges; accordingly, it is proposed to close the annuities register (see Part I., paragraph 1) as soon as the requisite evidence is furnished that the existing annuities have ceased.Paragraph 3 enacts a penalty for misdemeanours in connexion with official certificates of search.In order to reproduce the effect of the provisions of the Act of 1888 (as amended) in connexion with land charges, some violence had to be done to the language in order to define the groups of the different classes of land charges dealt with; hence these provisions are set out in the Second Part of the Sixth Schedule.In accordance with the proposed amendments in reference to the Law of Property (Consolidation) Bill, a &quot; puisne mortgage &quot; is now included within Class C.Statutory overreaching powers are expressly saved, and the effect of the Land Charges Acts as respects registered land is made clear.Administration of Estates. (See Seventh Schedule.) The proposed amendments are in the main drafting amendments.Registration of Title to Land. (See Eighth Schedule.) It is not necessary in this case to divide the Eighth Schedule into two parts, for such alterations in language as have been made are in the main consequential on the other Consolidating Bills or the Act of 1922.Schedules IX. and X.These Schedules are intended to facilitate the work of statute law revision.(194) b
