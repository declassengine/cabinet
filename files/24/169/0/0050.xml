copy of letter., from the&apos; Pemaneht Under Secretary &quot;of State&quot;, Poriljin&apos; .0&apos;ffioe&quot;,T&quot;to&apos;&quot;TheirS*ecretary toTTheCabinet.Foreign Office, S.W.I. 15th December, 1924.My dear Hankey,In reply to your letter of the 10th instant, I under-stand that we have no treaty right to appoint the Sirdar of the Egyptian Army or to insist on British officers being attached to that force.     The system, which dates from 1883, has hitherto existed solely at the pleasure of the Egyptian Government.Following the disbandment of the Egyptian Army, after-the revolt of Arabi Pasha and his defeat at Tel-el-Kebir in September 1832, the question of the reconstruction of that army was considered by Lord Dufferin and his military advisers in connection with the general question of reorganisation in Egypt.Writing on the 6th February, 1S83, Lord Dufferin stated: &quot;At the earnest desire of the Khedive and his Ministers a desire which was perfectly spontaneous - the Egyptian Army will be temporarily/- placed under the immediate direction of an English general;   and a few English officers will be attached to its battalions.&quot; The first Sirdar under this arrangement was Sir Evelyn Wood, appointed on the 16th January, 1883, his successors being, in order, Sir Francis Grenfell, 19th April, 1885; General (afterwards Lord) Kitchener, 9th April, 1892; Sir R. Wingate, 23rd December, 1899, and Sir Lee Stack (definitively) 9th May, 1919.Lieutenant- colonel sir Maurice Hankey, G.C.B.
The Sirdarship is in itself quite independent of the Governor-Generalship of the Sudan;   and between 1883 and 1885 the two posts were not held by the 3ame person, Thus, although Sir E.Wood was appointed Sirdar in January 1883, Ala-ed-Din Pasha was appointed Government-General of the Sudan four days later, and was succeeded by General Gordon in January 1884, the Sirdarship still being held by Sir E.-.Wood.     Moreover, although after the evacuation of the Sudan in 1985, the Governor-Gensrslship ceased to exist, the position of Sirdar remained;   and when, in January 1899, after the re-conquest of the Sudan the post of Governor-General was revived, Lord Kitchener, who was appointed, had already held the Sirdarship since April 1892.While, since 1899, the two posts have ben held together a3 a matter of convenience and because the Anglo-Egyptian Convention of that year prescribes that the Governor-General shall exercise the supreme command in the Sudan, the appoint-rnents, in the case of Lord Kitchener and Sir;R.Wingate, were made by separate decrees.     Those appointing the Sirdar stated in the preamble that the appointment was made on the motion of the Minister of War and Marine, with the approval of the Council of Ministers.     The preamble of the decrees appointing the Governor-General set forth that the appointments were made in accordance with article 3 of the Anglo-Egyptian agreement of 19th January, 1899.With the disappearance of all Egyptian Array units from the Sudan, the position has completely changed, and it is difficult to see on what ground we could justify a claim to appoint a Sirdar to command a purely Egyptian force on Egyptian territory.Yours sincerely,(Sd^ EYRE A, CROWE.
