1. There have been several references in the Press recently to an acute difference of opinion between the American, and Indian delegations at the second of the two-Opium Conferences now being held at Geneva, and as this may have a reaction on Anglo-American relations, it is desirable that I should apprise my colleagues of the actual state of affairs.2. To understand the position it is necessary for me briefly to describe the origin and scope of these two Conferences. In May 1923 an American delegation, led by Mr. Porter, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the House of Representatives, attended a meeting of the Opium Advisory Committee at Geneva-and presented for adoption two proposals, (a) that, according to the spirit of the Hague Convention, the use of opium products for other than medicinal and scientific purposes is an abuse and not legitimate, and (6) that to prevent the abuse of these products it is necessary to control the production of raw opium so that there will be no surplus available for non-medical and non-scientific purposes. After a discussion extending over several days the Advisory Committee adopted a number of resolutions. (Annexure A.)These resolutions, it will be seen, include a reservation made by Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal and Siam, that &quot; the use of prepared opium and the production, export and import of raw opium for that purpose are legitimate, so long as that use is subject to and in accordance with the provision of Chapter II of the Convention,&quot; and to the resolutions was also appended a reservation by India that &quot; the use of raw opium according to the established practice in India and its production for such use are not illegitimate under the Convention.&quot; The latter reservation, though not specifically accepted by the American delegation, was not challenged by it.3. A Committee of the Fourth Assembly considered these resolutions in September 1923. Mr. Porter and his colleagues were present in a consrdtative capacity and in explaining the attitude of his Government towards the Indian reservation, Mr. Porter stated that he did not desire to discuss questions of purely domestic legislation in connection with the use of opium, adding that his Government did not regard as legitimate any international traffic in opium for other than medical and scientific purposes except under the-conditions explicitly laid down in the Convention. As this statement was in conformity with the position always taken up by the Government of India no reply was necessary and none was in fact made. On receiving the report of its Committee the Assembly adopted the resolutions of the Advisory Opium Committee, taking note of the reservations made, and decided to convene two Conferences the first to consider the question of opium smoking in Far Eastern countries, and the second to consider the question of the limitation of the manufacture of drugs and the limitation of the production of raw opium and coca leaf for that purpose. A copy of the Assembly Resolution of the 27th September is annexed (Annexure B).4. With the work of the first of these two Conferences India was interested in two ways. Opium smoking is practised in Burma under a system more rigid than-in any other Eastern country, while the Far Eastern countries (including several British Colonies), where opium smoking is prevalent, obtained supplies of raw opium from India. All opium exported from. India to such countries is covered by certificate issued by the Governments of the consuming countries that the opium is required for legitimate purposes. The agreement reached at the first Conference can be accepted without difficulty by India as the restriction measures proposed to be applied in opium smoking countries are much less drastic than those already in force in Burma, while as a supplier of the raw material India accepts without protest any loss of revenue involved by the reduction of demand that may result from the application of the new regulations.5. The second Conference, which deals with drugs, is now sitting, and the Opium Advisory Committee had placed before it a scheme for the international control of manufacture and proposals for the amendment of the Hague Convention.7862     100   12.24 AfThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;!&apos;   Printed&apos;for the Cabinet.   December 1924.SECRET.CP. 520 (24).Geneva Opium Conference.
It was not expected that India would be closely concerned with the work of this Conference except that, inasmuch as India suffers from illicit imports of dangerous drugs, any practical measures designed to limit manufacture to strictly medical purposes would have received the cordial support of the Indian Delegation. As Indian opium, owing to its low morphine content, is not.ordinarily used by other countries for the manufacture of morphine, the interest of India, as a producer of the raw material, was negligible.6. The American Delegation, however, has entirely falsified this expectation. With what appears to be a complete disregard of the Assembly Resolution of the 27th July (Annexure 13), and of his own declaration that he had no wish to discuss questions of purely domestic legislation, Mr. Porter, on the fourth clay of the Conference, presented the proposals of the American Government. These were contained, in a document of 25 printed pages, and took the form of a comprehensive re-draft of the Hague Convention. To illustrate the far-reaching nature of these proposals I may refer to Articles 1 and 8. The redraft of Article 1 provides that the Contracting Parties shall enact effective laws for the control of the production and distribution of raw opium and coca leaves, so that there will be no surplus available for purposes not strictly medical or scientific, while the redraft of Article 8 provides that each Contracting Party in whose territory the use of prepared opium is now temporarily permitted agrees to abolish smoking in 10 years by reducing imports of raw opium by 10 per cent, per annum.7. The redraft of Article 8 is a matter for the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and with the question of the practicability of the American proposal in Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements I am not concerned. But 1 find it difficult to understand how the Second Conference which is exclusively concerned with drugs can deal with the question of opium smoking which has already been settled by the First Conference.8. The redraft of Article 1 raises the whole question of opium eating in India. This has always been regarded by the Government of India as a matter of domestic and not of international concern, and in this connection it is important to remember that, under the Reforms, excise administration (which includes opium) is in all provinces in India, except one, a &quot;transferred &quot; subject under the control of Indian Ministers responsible to Provincial Legislative Councils. That the regulation of opium eating in India is a matter of domestic concern has apparently been accepted by the American Delegation, and one can only surmise that in attempting to reopen the question Mr. Porter is either anxious to include in the Convention at all costs an affirmation of the American principle that opium shall only be used for medical or scientific purposes without regard to the practical consequence or that he is animated by a desire to isolate Great Britain and India. However this may be, it seems reasonably clear that the Second Conference cannot under its mandate deal with this question. If it be held that the matter is one of international interest,&apos; an international Conference should be convened for the purpose, and to this I do not imagine that the Government of India would object as the practice of opium eating in India, rigidly regulated as it is, can be defended without difficulty.9. The policy of the Government of India was, after an elaborate enquiry in 1895, approved by a Royal Commission, and it is significant that since then the per capita consumption has not increased.It is gratifying also to find that at the Conference now sitting atGeueva generous tributes have been paid to the attitude of the Government, of India towards the opium question generally by some of the representatives of missionary bodies and others who were permitted to address the Conference. The Secretary to the Inter-national Missionary Council, though supporting the American proposals, testified to the efficiency and honesty of purpose of the Government of India, and Mr. McLennan (of the Missionary Conference) warmly acknowledged the efficiency and singleness of purpose with which the Government of India had attacked their opium problem, adding that if all Governments had dealt with the matter in the same way the opium problem would already have been solved.10. This being the position, the India Delegation was forced to raise the question of the competence of the Conference, and this has given rise to the conflict between the two delegations to which prominence has been given in the Press. As to the merits of the dispute there can be little doubt, having regard to the terms of the Assembly Resolution of 27th July 1923, that the Indian Delegation is in the right, and on
Saturday last I sent a telegram to Mr. Campbell, the head of the delegation, approving . his action in raising the question. - . .     , ,    . ....., , ,  ,The; daily reports, however, which I have been receiving from Geneva indicate that the question is not being dealt with on its merits. Political considerations, I am told, are influencing decisions to an undesirable extent, and the American Delegation is reported to have captured the majority of the delegation. -I learn from this morning&apos;s Times that on a vote being taken the Conference decided that it was competent to consider the American proposals by 26 votes.to I, ninecountries, including Great Britain, Turkey, Australia, France and Holland,, abstaining. The abstentions, it maybe presumed, were dictated, by political considerations. I have already instructed Mr. Campbell not to leave -the Conference, but to press for a post-ponement of the discussion on Article 1 so as to give me i time to consult the Government of India, adding that; if discussion is insisted on, he should direct his efforts towards securing the revision of the Article in a form that might be acceptable to the Government of India. I suggest that instructions might be issued to,the British Delegation actively to support him in this effort. The Article might be made acceptable either by limiting its application to opium produced for export (this was apparently the intention of the Fourth Assembly Resolution) or by the addition of a proviso saving the rights of the Governments in India to regulate domestic consumption. If the Article is not amended in some such manner, it will, I fear, in existiug conditions, be difficult if not impossible for India to accept the redraft of the Hague Convention.11. But while I have made it plain that we have a very good controversial case on the immediate issue, there -are broader aspects of it which must be borne in mind. I anticipate that the next few years will witness a steadily intensifying attack, both in America and in this country, &quot;on the opium trade in general and India&apos;s participation in it in particular. Many of those who take the lead in it may be actuated by unworthy motives, but they will have with them a growing mass of religious opinion in both countries, and of missionary opinion in all countries, and this opinion is much more influential and much better organised than it has ever been before. We must, therefore, not. leave, out of sight the possibility that India, notwithstanding all that she is admitted to have done already, will eventually be forced to take much more drastic measures as regards limitation both of production and of export, and the moment may come when it will be politic to make. a virtue of a necessity and move before we are obliged to. For the time being we can defend ourselves at Geneva, but I do not pretend to think that if we are successful we shall be immune from further attacks next year and the year after.BIRKENHEAD.2nd December 1924.&apos;   ANNEXURE A. Resolutions adopted by Opium Advisory Committee (Fifth Session).I. The Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium accepts and recommends to the League of Nations the proposals of the United States representatives as embodying the general principles by -which the Governments should be guided in dealing with the question of the abuse of dangerous drugs and on which, in fact, the International Convention of 1912 is based, subjt-ct to the fact that the following reservation has been made by the representatives of the Governments of France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal and Siam :&quot;The use of prepared opium and the production, export and import of raw opium for that purpose, are legitimate so long as that use is subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of the Convention.&quot;II. The Advisory Committee, appreciating the great value of the co-operation of the Government of the United States&apos;of America in the efforts which the League has for the past two years been making to deal with the question of the abuse of dangerous drugs, expresses the belief that all the Governments concerned will be desirous of co-operating with that Government in giving the fullest possible effect to the Convention. - .   ...III. In bringing the American proposals to the notice of the Council and the Assembly, the Advisory Committee would recall that, during the two years that have elapsed since the Convention came into operation, it has worked towards the same ends by i (1) taking all possible bteps to secure the adhesion of all countries to the Convention ; (2) investigating the question of the world&apos;s needs7S62 A 2;-^v;-.&apos;V&apos;1:-^.hT-r-t    .-.^-71-;:--*&quot;.&quot;^... &quot;-^VirTTT-T      fit
of the manufactured drugs for medicinal and scientific uses with a view to the eventual limitation of the production of these drugs; (3) recommending the system of import certificates, arranging the exchange between States of information in,regard to the illicit traffic in the drugs aud proposing other measures for securing international co-operation in suppressing that traffic ; (4) invitin^ the lowers with territories in the Far East to review their requirements of opium, and submitting proposals for an investigation by the Chinese Government of the conditions in China, with a view to the more effective application of Chapter II of the Convention and the solution of the problem of the use of prepared opium in the Far Bast; (5) collecting and publishing information as to the measures taken to give effect to the Convention and the position generally in all countries in regard to the traffic, with a view to securing the enforcement of the Convention.IV. As a means of giving.effect to the principles submitted by the representatives of the United States and the policy which the League, on the recommendation of the Committee, has adopted, and having regard to the information now available, the Advisory Committee recommends to the Council the advisability of inviting:(a) The Governments of the States in which morphine, heroin, or cocaine, and their respective salts are manufactured and the Governments of the States in which raw opium or the coca leaf are produced for export for the purpose of such manufacture ;(b) The Governments having territories, in which the use of prepared opium is temporarily continued under the provisions of Chapter II of the Convention and the Government of the Republic of China,to enter into immediate negotiations (by nominating representatives to form a committee or committees, or otherwise) to consider whether, with a view to giving the fullest possible effect to the Convention of 1912, agreements could not now be reached between them :(a) as to a limitation of the amounts of morphine, heroin or cocaine and their respective salts to be manufactured; as to a limitation of the amounts of raw opium and the coca leaf to be imported for that purpose and for other medicinal and scientific purposes ; and as to a limitation of the production of raw opium and the coca leaf for export to the amount required for such medicinal and scientific purposes. The latter limitation is not to be deemed to apply to the production and export of raw opium for the purpose of smoking in those territories where that practice is temporarily continued under the provisions of Chapter II of the Convention ; (i) as to a reduction of the amount of raw opium to be imported for the purpose of smoking in those territories, where it is temporarily continued, and as to the measures which should be taken by the Government of the Republic of China to bring about a suppression of the illegal production and use of opium in China.Reservation by the Representative of the Government of India.The representative of the Government of India associates himself with the foregoing resolution, subject to the following reservation regarding para. I. :&quot;The use of raw opium, according to the established practice in India, and its production for such use are not illegitimate under the Convention.&quot;2. The Advisory Committee, having regard to the large amount of detailed information now available, recommends the Council to invite the Powers with Far Eastern territories where the use of opium for smoking is temporarily continued in pursuance of Chapter II of the Opium Convention, to enter into immediate negotiations, by means of calling a special conference of representatives of these Governments, or otherwise, to consider what measures could be taken to give a more effective application to Chapter II of the Convention and to bring about a reduction of the amount of opium used, and whether, on the lines of the suggestions set out below or on other lines, an agreement or understanding could not now be reached for the adoption of a uniform policy on the matter : (i) That the farm system, where it is still in operation, should be abolished and that the opiumbusiness should be made a Government monopoly and kept entirely in the hands of the Government.(ii) As,a corollary of para. 1, that the retail sale of prepared opium should be made only from government shops, and that all private shops should be abolished. Persons in charge of Government shops should be paid a fixed salary without any commission on the amount of business doue, and therefore would have no temptation to push the sales.(iii) That a uniform maximum limit should be fixed for the amount of prepared opium placed onsale for consumption, calculated according to the number of the adult Chinese male population, e.g., x taels per 10,000 adult Chinese males in the territory, and that the annual imports of raw opium should be limited to the amount required for that rate of consumption.(iv) That the possibilities of the system of registration and licensing, which has already been introduced in some of the Far Eastern territories, should be thoroughly explored.(v) That the possibility should be considered of making uniform, so far as circumstances permit :(a) the price at which prepared opium is retailed in the different territories, and(b) the penalties for infraction of the law in regard to the import, export, sale and use of prepared opium.(vi) That the interested Powers, that is, the Powers having territories in the Far East where theconsumption of prepared opium is still permitted, should conclude an agreement among &apos; themselves to apply the foregoing measures for the purpose of carrying out Chapter II of lhe Convention.i (yji) That the position should be generally reviewed periodically by the Powers interested and the question of further reducing the maximum limit fixed in the agreement should be considered.
m3. The Advisory Committee asks the Council to request the Governments to communicate then-views as to the possibility of a total suppression of the manufacture of heroin or of its limitation to the minimum amount required.4. The Advisory Committee, being convinced of the great value of the information contained in the annual reports which each Government has been requested to transmit to the Secretariat, once more recommends the Council to urge on the Governments the importance of sending regularly to the Secretariat such reports, which should contain the fullest possible information, both with regard to the production of and the traffic in opium and other narcotics.5. The Advisory Committee recommends the Council to draw the attention of the Governments to the extreme desirability not only of direct communication to other immediately interested Governments of the details of any seizures made, but also of a general communication to the Secretariat of the League of Nations of all important seizures in order that the fullest international publicity may be secured by the transmission, with the consent of the Governments concerned, of this information by the Secretariat both to other Governments not immediately concerned in the specific case and to the Press. iG. The Advisory Committee recommends that the statement prepared by the Secretariat for the Sub-Committee on Customs Statistics, together with the memorandum prepared by Sir Malcolm Delevingne on the position of bonded warehouses in regard to the traffic in narcotics, should be communicated to the Governments with a request for their observations.7. The Advisory Committee, considering that the infliction of severe penalties on persons engaged in the illicit traffic in narcotics is one of the best means of preventing the spread of that traffic, recommends the increase of penalties in certain countries, the adoption of the penalty of imprisonment, and, if possible, of prohibition of residence (interdiction de sejour), a very strict application of the penalties laid down, and the introduction of clauses providing for the punishment of infractions committed in foreign countries.ANNEXURE B. Assembly Resolution of 27th September 1923.1. The Assembly expresses its deep appreciation of the very valuable work done by the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and other Dangerous Drugs, adopts its report and resolutions, taking note of the reservations contained therein, and asks the Council to take the necessary steps to put these resolutions iiito effect.2. The Assembly, in view of Turkey having agreed, by the Treaty of Lausanne, to adopt and to enforce the International Opium Convention of 1912, and in view of its importance as an opium-producing country, expresses the wish that the Turkish Government on its ratification of the Convention and signature of the final Protocol of 1914 be invited to nominate a representative to serve on the Advisory Committee.3. The Assembly asks the Council to repeat its request to the Governments of. Albania, Argentine, Colombia, Costa Eica, Lithuania, Paraguay, Persia and Switzerland, that they should take all possible measures with a view to the prompt ratification and application of the Opium Convention.4. The Assembly, taking note with regret of the fact that a number of countries have not yet adopted the import certificate system as recommended by the Assembly in 1921 and 1922, reiterates the opinion expressed by the Assembly in 1922, that this system is the most practical method yet suggested for controlling the import and export of the drugs in accordance with the provisions of the International Opium Convention and that its success depends on its adoption by all countries engaged in importing or exporting the drugs. In view of the serious difficulties created by the non-adoption, up to the present, of the system by several important countries, requests that the Advisory Committee may be instructed to proceed with the consideration of the suggestion contained in the second resolution adopted by the Assembly in 1922, and to report specially to the next Assembly on the whole situation.5. The Assembly approves the proposal of the Advisory Committee that the Governments concerned should be invited immediately to enter into negotiations with a view to the conclusion of an agreement as to the measures for giving effective application in the Far Eastern territories to Part II. of the Convention and as to a reduction of the amount of raw opium to be imported for the . purpose of smoking in those territories where it is temporarily continued, and as to the measures which should be taken by the Government of the Republic of China to bring about the suppression of the illegal production and use of opium in China, and requests the Council to invite those Govern-ments to send representatives with plenipotentiary powers to a conference for the purpose and to report to the Council at the earliest possible date.(S. The Assembly, having noted with satisfaction that, in accordance with the hope expressed in the fourth resolution adopted by the Assembly in 1922, the Advisory Committee has reported chat the information now available makes it possible for the Governments concerned to examine, with a view to the conclusion of an agreement, the question of the limitation of the amounts of morphine, heroin or cocaine and their respective salts to be manufactured ; of the limitation of the amounts of raw opium and the coca leaf to be imported for that purpose and for other medicinal and scientilio purposes; and of the limitation of the production of raw opium and the coca leaf for export to the amount required for such medicinal and scientific purposes, requests the Council, as a means of giving effect to the principles submitted by the representatives of the United States of America, and to the policy which the League, on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, has adopted, to invite the Governments concerned to send representatives with plenipotentiary powers to a conference for this purpose, to be held, if possible, immediately after the conference mentioned in Resolution V.Tho Assembly also suggests, for the consideration of the Council, the advisability of enlarging this conference so as to include within its scope all countries which are Members of the League, or Parties to the Convention of 1912, with a view to securing their adhesion to the principles that may be embodied in any agreement reached.
