This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.SECRET.Copt No.r5 nCP. 527 (24).THE CABINET.THE EVACUATION OF THE RHINELAND.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate for consideration by my colleagues a Memorandum by the Chief of the    0154 Imperial General Staff on the question of whether Germany has or has not carried out the    6542 Military Clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, with special reference to Articles 428 and 429 of that Treaty.L. W.-E.The War Office,8* December, 1924.1. In the Foreign Office Memorandum No. C. 17469/4736/18, dated 29th November, 1924, on the question of the evacuation of the Northern Area of the Rhineland, the following words occur : &quot; It will thus be seen that the only really material question at present outstanding against Germany is military control; and that may possibly (though improbably) be cleared up before 10th January, 1925.&quot;In view of the above, the following considered opinion is given by the General Staff, based upon reliable information supplied mainly from the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control in Germany up to the present date : 2. Germany has not yet carried out the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. The recent general inspection, which has been proceeding for the last two months and which is not yet completed, shows conclusively that, while the infractions of the treaty are numerous and often small, several of the most important clauses have not yet been carried out, viz. : (i) Transformation of factories to peace-time production (Article 168).(ii) Disposal of the dumps of war material formerly in the hands of the Reichstreu-handgesellschaft and arsenals (Article 169).(iii) The necessary legislation (points 5 A and B of the Five Points). This falls under the following headings : (a) Recruiting and volunteers (Zeitfreiwilligen) (Articles 160, 174 and 178).(b) Patriotic societies (military) (Article 177).(c) Unauthorised production or possession of armaments (Article 168).(d) Import and export of war material (Articles 170 and 211).(iv) Coast Defence and Fortress Guns (Article 167).(v) Reorganization of Police (Article 162).3. It is, in the opinion of the General Staff, imperative to insist upon these important clauses being at least in actual and effectual process of completion before concessions to Germany in regard to the evacuation of the Rhineland are made.26/Ptg/364  100  12/24  W.O.P.  1626
