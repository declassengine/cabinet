[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET.Copy No. 39C.P. 505 (24).Oil7/. eJOlllioXCABINET.EGYPT.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AS the Cabinet is now confronted with the consequences of our disastrous policy in Egypt, they may find it convenient to look back to its origins. I therefore reprint the memorandum which I circulated in August 1920, when Lord Milner&apos;s proposals were first made public.I VENTURE to ask most respectfully, but at the same time most urgently, that the Cabinet may be permitted to have an opportunity of at any rate discussing the proposals which have been published in all the newspapers for giving independence to Egypt. I read these proposals for the first time in yesterday&apos;s newspapers with verj great bewilderment.The&apos;Foreign Office telegrams of the 21st August (Nos. 750 and 751) which reached me last night show that the story published in the newspapers is in all respects true, and that the proposals have been simultaneously communicated to the-Press, the public and the British representatives in Egypt before either the Cabinet or Parliament had been allowed to know of their existence.I submit that this procedure raises a very great difficulty. While the British will be&apos;&apos;held committed to approving proposals of this character, the Egyptian Nationalists will be free to take them merely as a starting point for further demands- thus, even from the point of view of bargaining, the disclosures which have taken place seem to be regrettable. The cession of territory which has been definitely incorporated in the British Dominions is, however, a matter which requires the assent not only of the Cabinet, but of Crown and Parliament.Coming to the actual proposals themselves, one must ask oneself, first; are they real or are they a manoeuvre? If they are real, they mean that we are giving up Egypt.- Egypt is to become an independent country, which will make a Treaty of Alliance &quot;with the United Kingdom, accord us certain military and naval facilities, and act in foreign affairs in general conformity with our wishes and interests. Egypt will be free to conduct her internal affairs as she pleases, i.e., she may substitute the Communist for the individualist system of society. She may raise a large army by conscription or she may abolish the existing Egyptian Army altogether. She may erect a customs tariff oradopt Free Trade. She may appoint ambassadors throughout the world. All these imprescriptible rights of sovereignty are to be conferred upon Egypt 6&apos;n&apos;paper.Alternatively, we may be told this is mere camouflage. Not one Egyptian from the Khedive &quot;downwards will be able to act otherwise than in accordance with British advice. Although Egypt will be free in theory to do all these things, in practice she will do all she is told! She will be ruled under such systems and through such agents as the British Government choose and under no other. Having formally divested ourselves of every shadow of legal right, we shall nevertheless exercise final and absolute power. It is true there will be no Army of Occupation, but the same troops living in the same barracks will be called &quot;The British Army for maintaining theW.S. C.Treasury, S.W.I.&quot;.&apos; .1: November 24, 1924.(Secret.) (OP. 18.03.)The Egyptian Proposals.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.(79/Egypt/55.)[12305]
communications with the East.&quot; When a state of disorder arises in Cairo, British soldiers who are called upon to fire on the crowd will not be shooting in order to suppress tumult in Egypt. They will be &quot; safeguarding our communications with the East,&quot; &amp;c.If this, as I expect, is really what is meant by the new instrument, I can only think that the Egyptian Nationalists niust bevery great simpletons if they let it rest there. Their demand is for the effective and responsible control of their own country and the right to govern or misgovern it as they please. It is because this has never been accorded to them, and never can be accorded to them while we remain in the country, that they are discontented. It is not the empty form of independence which they seek, but the reality. Is the British nation willing to concede that reality ? If not, will the British resistance to the concession of that reality be rendered more difficult or more easy by the concession of the form ? I think it will be rendered vastly more difficult.- - Incidentally s I may observe that it sweeps away altogether any claim which we might make for recovering any portion of the cost of the garrison from the Egyptian taxpayer. This garrison is declared by us to be in Egypt for a purely Imperial purpose, namely, the maintenance of our communications with the East, and not as an Army of Occupation. Therefore, obviously, we have no claim upon the independent State of Egypt.The repercussion of these proposals and this model upon other parts&apos; of the British Empire may even be more serious than the effect on Egypt. If we leave out the word &quot; Egypt &quot; in the document circulated last night by the Foreign Office and substitute the word &quot; Ireland,&quot; it would with very small omissions make perfectly good sense, and would constitute a complete acceptance of Mr. De Valera&apos;s demands. ; ; One can also easily see that these proposals will become immediately the goal of Indian nationalism, the ideal which-Mr. Montagu has been endeavouring to hold up before Indian eyes of India as a great self-governing Dominion within tbe ambit of the British Empire and under the supreme authority of the British Monarchy will &apos;be discarded in favour of an independent Indian Empire, according, no doubt, to the British the sort of trading and practical facilities which were obtained in the Eighteenth Century by the British East India Company. I thought we had all arrived in common at the conception of the British Empire as a grouping of self-governing Dominions gathered together under the aegis of the Crown, developing under various degrees of responsibility within that circle. Surely here we are. taking a retrograde step. - ,1 -r .After all, the Proclamation of the Protectorate over Egypt was a solemn act of State, and we have laboriously procured the assent of all our allies, one. after another, to that act. No sooner is this done than we come forward and tear up the charter to which have just obtained the signatures of all the greatest Powers.in the World.It may have been wise or unwise to alter the juridical status of Egypt.in the war, arid I myself have often thought that the ex-Khedive was treated with precipitate severity; but a step- of this kind, once taken, ought not to be lightly retraced. In my judgment we should adhere to the broad ideal of full self-govern-ment within the Empire and under the Crown for all parts of the King&apos;s Dominions, whether in Egypt, Ireland or India, and that any departure from this ideal and goal should only be made by a Government which has definitely submitted its. case to the British Parliament. Following this conviction, it seems to me thatthemost we have to.offer to the Egyptians or to the Irish is real concessions in regard to the management of their own affairs, and that all demands to break away, from the British Empire and British Crown should be perseveringly withstood., ^^-m .Lastly, it is my duty to point out that neither the War Office nor;.:the Air Ministry, nor, so far as I know, the Admiralty, have been consulted in any way upon flie strategic bearing of these proposals, and I submit that the Cabinet shotild have the advice of the military and naval experts before them before giving their,assent to such a scheme. . i j.::. i&apos;. -; :I append memoranda by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff arid by the Chief of the Air Staff. * &apos; ..
