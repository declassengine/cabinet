UNITED STATES CLAIM TO REPARATION.I circulate to my colleagues a revised draft to the United States Ambassador on the subject of the American claim to participation in the Dawes annuities.A. C.Foreign Office,December 2nd, 1924.
(C. 18120/75/18)-.FOREIGN OFFICE,December       . 1924.nlted States Ambassador. ,Your Excellency,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the memorandum of November 15th which you handed to me personally at our interview on November 19th in ex-explanation of the views of the United States government regarding their par-tic lp at ion in the payments to be made by Germany under the Dawes plan.2.    In that memorandum Your Excellency explains the reasons which, in the opinion of your government, justify this demand.    They divide their claims against Germany into two classes:-(1)   costs for the maintenance of the American army of occupation;(2)   claims for damages to persons and property.3.    Your Excellency will recollect that during our interview I repeated to you the assurance already given to you - verbally on October 27th by Sir E.Crowe that, so far as His Majesty1s Government are concerned the question regarding the costs of the American army of occupation has already been disposed of.    An agreement regulating that question was signed
signed on:May 25th, 1923, as Your Excellency records in your memorandum&apos; under reply, between the United States and the Principal Allied powers.    That agreement has since been ratified, and the principle at stake has thus been finally settled so far as this country is concerned.    His Majesty&apos;s Government consequently do not anticipate any difficulties as regards that matter.4.    As to the second claim advanced&apos; by Your Excellency - that for damages to persons and property - His Majesty&apos;s Government understand from your memorandum that it is based not only on treaty rights but also upon a passage in the Dawes re-port and upon grounds of common equity. It is with sincere regret that as regards the legal position which Your Excellency -seeks to establish His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are unable to see eye to eye with the American government.5*    It is due to the United States government that I should state the-view taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the legal position.   They are unable to agree that,Germany had it in her power by her later treaty with the United States of America to alter or vary the obligations-that by the earlier-treaty of Versailles she had already contracted towards thePowers
Powers which ratified that treaty.   The contention, as I understand it, is that Germany by the separate treaty with the United States of America has undertaken to accord to the United States all the rights and advantages stipulated for the benefit of the United States in the treaty of Versailles (including the reparation section of that treaty) notwithstanding the fact that such treaty has not been ratified by the United States.    His Majesty&apos;s Government are however advised that this stipulation covers undertakings which Germany had not the power to give in view of previous obligations which she had incurred under the treaty of Versailles. By article 248 of that treaty Germany con-stltuted the reparation obligations a first charge upon.all her assets and she therefore v/as not in a legal position to incur any fresh obligation towards another Power which had not ratified the treaty, if the effect would be- to diminish the re-sources available for reparation to the Allied Powers which had ratified.6.    His Majesty&apos;s Government are un-able to agree that the report of the Dawes Committee could alter this legal position. The Dawes Committee was appointed by the Reparation Commission (which derives its authority with regard to Germany from the treaty of Versailles alone) to &quot;considerthe
m&quot;the means of.balancing the (German) budget &quot;and the measures to be taken to stabilise &quot;the currency&quot;. Any question as to ;the States which were to share in the repara-tlon payments, or as to the proportions of the sharo of each, was clearly outside the scope of the committee1s functions.7.    I need not repeat to Your Excellency that I do not for one moment dispute the explanation which you were good enough to give me of the intentions which caused your government to instruct the American member of the Dawes Committee to introduce the words &quot;and Associated Powers&quot; into the Committee&apos;s report. Your Excellency must however allow me to say on my part that if the United States govern-ment understood the passage to have been Inserted for the express purpose of placing on record a formal recognition of their claim to a share of the Dawes annuities, this was certainly not so understood by the British members of the Dawes Committee, Indeed I am informed that the matter was never discussed in this sense either in the full committee or in the drafting committee whan the text of the report was under prep-a ration, nor during the proceedings of the second committee of the recent London conference, to whqse report reference is made on the third page of Your Excellency^ note,
8.    I should add that under the terms of the treaty of Versailles the amount of the damage for which compensa-tion was to he made by Germany was left to be determined by the Reparation Commission, For the, purpose of carrying out their task in this respect, the Commission had to take into account the various claims put forward by the several allied governments. At no time, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment are aware, did the American gov-ernment during the discussions that then took place either within the commission or outside it, make any intimation that they wished to put forward a claim for Inclusion in the total to be demanded from Germany.    Nor does any reservation appear to have been made by any American representative, official or unofficial, of any possible future right of America to make such claim.    The American government were represented at the conferences held at Spa in 1920 with the object of arriving at an agreement concerning the proportions in which the amount of reparations when received should be divided between the states entitled to share in the repara-tions.    There is no record of any attempt having been made on the part of the American representatives either on that occasion or since to claim a percentagein
in the allotment then being laid down amongtit, themselves by the allies for the distribution of German reparation payments when received.    Nor did this create any surprise among the. allied governments, since it had become generally understood that the United States government made a special point of not demanding reparations from the Powers defeated in the war.   In that belief His Majesty1s Government were strongly confirmed when, in a speech at Newhaven on 29th December 1922, of which the American Secretary of State caused the text most courteously, though-informally, to be communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, the American Secretary of State used the following words&apos;:-&quot;-The crux of the European situation &quot;lies in the settlement of reparations, &quot;There will be no adjustment of other &quot;needs, however pressing, until a definite &quot;and accepted basis for the discharge of &quot;reparation claims has been fixed.    It &quot;is futile to attempt to erect any economic &quot;structure in Europe until the foundation &quot;is laid.&quot;How can the United States help in &quot;this matter?   We are not seeking repara- &apos; &quot;tions.   We are, Indeed, asking for the &quot;reimbursement of the costs of our army of &quot;occupation;   and with good reason, for wehave
&quot;have maintained our army in Europe at the &quot;request of the allies and of Germany, and &quot;under an agreement that its costs with like &quot;army costs should he a first charge upon &quot;the amounts paid by Germany.   Others have &quot;been paid and we have not been paid.&quot;But we are not seeking general-repara-&quot;tlons.   We are bearing our own burden; &quot;and through our loans a large part of &quot; Europe&apos;s burden in addition.   No demands &quot; of ours stand in the way of a proper settle-&quot;ment of the reparation question&quot;. It was in these circumstances, as I had the honour verbally to explain to Your Ex-cellency, that not having hitherto doubted that these words still correctly described the policy of the American government, the intimation that they now claimed a share to the Dawes annuities in respect of rep-arations, and apart from the cost of the army of occupation, came upon His Majesty&apos;8 government as a complete surprise.9.   I have felt it to be due to Your Excellency and to the Government of the United States of America that I should ex-plain thus fully the grounds on which His Majesty&apos;&amp; Government are unable to admit the legal arguments brought forward in Your Excellency5s memorandum.   There re-mains, the question of equity raised in Your Excellency&apos;s memorandum.His
His Majesty&apos;s Government understand that the United States government has under its control very large sums arising from German property in the United States analogous to the property which under the terms of the Versailles Treaty has been used in allied countries to meet private claims arising out of the war.   Under the treaty any balance of these sums In allied countries is accountable to the general reparation pool.   Further there are certain sums in respect of ships retained by. the United States in excess of their ton-nage losses which under the ordinary treaty practice would be accountable to the pool,,   His Majesty&apos;s Government have no definite information as to the amount of these sums but they have al-ways understood that they are likely to be equal or nearly equal to the amounts awarded by the Mixed Commission,10.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are naturally anxious to give the fullest and most friendly consideration to any claim put forward by the United States government.   Though therefore for the reasons given above they find it difficult to see how the present claim could be sustained, they would be quitewilling
- 9 -willing to examine the whole matter in connection with the forthcoming meeting of Finance Ministers in Paris., if the United States governmentjwould supply them with a statement of any further grounds on which it appears to them that the claim can he maintained and would inform them what the amount of the claim actually is and whether the United States government is prepared to agree to set off against it. as other powers have done under the Treaty of Versailles the assets which have come into their hands and to have the net claim fixed as under the treaty by the Reparation Commission and made subject to the same reductions, owing to the reductions past or prospective of German payments, as apply to countries claiming under the Treaty of Versailles.11.   The United States government will no doubt recognise the fairness of their undertaking the same obligations under this head, as are binding on the Allies,   If the matter is to be con-sidered from the general point of view of equity, the propriety of such equality of benefit from and of corresponding contribution to the common fund can hardly be questioned.It
In r do-   1       i 10-It would accordingly &quot;be of real ad-vantage in forming a judgment on the practical Issue raised by the American claim if approximate figures as to the net amount involved could be furnished. If, in return, Your Excellency desires an exact statement of the obligations of the Allies in this matter, I shall be nappy to obtain it for you from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or it may be explained to the American representatives at the meeting of Finance Ministers at Paris.12.   The actual details of any arrangement that may ultimately prove possible must necessarily stand over until the forthcoming meeting of the Finance Ministers in Paris.   This, as Your Excellency is probably aware, can no longer take place at the beginning of December as His Majesty&apos;s Government had hoped.   But irksome though this delay may be in some respects, it has at least this advantage, that it will give longer time to consider in all 4%* aspects the questions Your Excellency has raised.13.   In closing this communication, I feel it is unnecessary to assure Your Excellency that no tiling is furtherfrom
- n -from my thoughts and that nothing would be more distasteful to His Majesty!s Government than to engage in a fruitless controversy over a matter of this kind with the United States government, of whose services to the common cause both during and since the war the British people are and always will be fully appreciativeo    At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government would be guilty of a gross breach of trust were they not also to safeguard to the best of &quot;their ability the legitimate interests of the British tax payers who are already bearing so large a share of the burdens inherited from the war, burdens which they have loyally shouldered and never by word or deed sought to evade as Your Excellency will be the first to admit.   If therefore His Majesty&apos;s Government hesitate so readily to accept the suggestions now put forward by the United States government as others, less heavily burdened, may already have done, it will not, I feel convinced, be imputed to any ill-will on their part.   Such is not the casee  But it would be frankly intolerable were the British Empire jin addition to meeting the very large share of the common debtincurred
- 12 -Incurred during the war for the common good, to he called upon to make the fur-ther sacrifice of renouncing some share of reparation at last in view in favour . of another power not similarly account-able to the pool for ex-enemy assets already held in possession,140   Lastly, I should mention that the Dominions&apos; interest in repara-tions would in any case require us to consult them through such representatives as they may appoint before arriving at any new decisions,,
