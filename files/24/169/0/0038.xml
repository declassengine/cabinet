The Trade Outlook.Engineering - General Trade.SIR ARTHUR BALJ?OUR said that, in regard to general trade, no material change appeared to have taken place in the general situation. The improvement already reported was maintained. Prices generally had not risen much, but probably would do so unless retail prioos on which the cost of living depended, could be steadied.   In this connection he regarded the&quot;setting up of the Royal Commission on food prices, under the chairmanship of Sir Auckland Geddes, as very opportune.   Labour in some quarters was making claims for increase if wages, but this could probably be dealt with by arbitration and negotiation.To turn to the Sheffield steel and engineering trade, Sheffield houses now found that they were getting back some of their German trades.   Before the War we supplied steel to Germany for the manufacture of razors etc., and this trade was now to some extent being resumed, under satisfactory arrangements, and payments from Germany were coming in well.   At the same time, German competition in South America was not so acute as it had been five or six months previously. This might be connected to some extent with the high discount and money rates prevailing in Germany, where it was usual to have to pay as much as 12$ to 24$ on oapital.OOLpNEL AMSTROHG said, speaking from the point of view of the Federation of BrlTish industries, that there was a general feeling that a slightly improved tendency was setting in, though no marked advance had taken place,.   The increase in the figures of retained imports was perhaps a favourable indication.In general engineering the situation was a little improved. A certain number of foreign orders were coming in, though not from European countries: there was also an inorease in the number of enquiries, and these seemed rather more earnest than before. There was as yet nothing that could definitely be called an improvement, but general indications were for a steadier state of affairs than hitherto.Iron and Steel, Engineering and Shipbuilding.SIR GLYNN WEST said that the only bright spot in the iron and steel trade was a oertain slackening in continental competition. The prico of continental billets had risen, but prices wore still very low, and left practically no margin of profit. Continental prices were still, in general, about  1 per ton below ours.The railway companies were putting out a large amount of work, and general engineering had reoently shown an improvement, partly on account of the orders placed by them. There was an increased demand for locomotives all over the world, but in this line also German competition was severe, their prices being below those quoted by British manufacturers. Nevertheless, we had secured certain orders, though at very low prices, on account of the competition.The increased activity was reacting favourably upon machine tools and small tools.There was undoubtedly a general tendency towards improvement, though not perhaps in the dirootion in which it would be mb3t welcome, since the present aotlvity was largely directed towards making up arrears in our own requirements.Shipbuilding had improved a little, though continental competition, especially from&apos;Holland, was very markedj orders for several ships which would have been of great benefit to the British industry had been plaoed in Holland during the last few days.-1-
CONFIDENTIAL. jIron and ateel, Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding.In the case of a recent contract which had come to his?notice, the British price was  212,000, while a similar vessel could be built abroad for  194,000.   It was true that the Dutch shipbuilders were, at least in some cases,] assisted to some extent by a Government subsidy, which - It was understood took the form chiefly of a reduction of municipal and other rates.   Dutch labour was also somewhat cheaper than ours.   Generally, it might be said that for ordinary-type cargo tonnage the continental price was about  10 ton as against  12 in this country. &apos;MR. DORMAN (toy letter):-There have been no fresh developments in the Iron and Steel position during the past month.   There is, however, a more confident feeling prevailing, tout this up to now has not resulted in any material increase in business.There is a little more demand for Big Iron and prices have slightly hardened.   It is understood that America is buying Pig Iron in this country which is considered a more hopeful sign.More Blast Furnaces have been re-started, including Blast Furnace and Steelwork Plants on the West Coast which have been idle for some time.British Steel prices are unchanged.Continental Steel competition is not quite so keen. Foreign Makers are well sold and they do not appear to toe desirous of selling very far ahead.   Prices round atoout  5.17.6 are now being asked for Continental Barst.   Continental Makers are still in a position, however, to underquote us toy 25/- to 55/- per ton, due to their lower wages, taxation and other costs.There ia no improvement in the position of English Shipbuilding Yards,   Orders, generally, are being placed very spasmodically, tout a fair amount of constructional work is being put in hand throughout the country.The Galvanised Sheet Trade is very firm indeed, and Makers are having no difficulty In disposing of their production.   Black Sheets are quiet with practically no demand.The Wire trade is dull, with few enquiries and little business.The feature is the large Increase in Imports amounting to 241,300 tons for October, whereas the Exports for the same month were 509,000 tons.   In 1912 the average monthly imports were 166,400 tons against exports of 400,000 tons.t Billets and. Sheet Bars.
CONFIDENTIAL. Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding.Undoubtedly heavy Railway rates are adding to the coets of manufacture, and it is instructive to note that the Railway Rate on finished steel from Middlesbrough Worts to Hiddlesbrough   Dock has increased 84$ over pre-war, and the rates on Cleveland Ironstone are 57yi over pre-war.     There are further instances of this large inorease in other parts of the country, whilst the realised price obtained for finished steel is only 35?? over pre-war.Electrical Engineering.Mr. HURST said that the electrical industry was, on the whole, well occupied.   General business was brisk.   In the heavy branch at home a slight set-back had taken place in October, possibly in some degree owing to the General Election, but this had been made up in November.   The export trade, however, was not quite so satisfactory.   Australia was still our best overseas market, though there was a slight improvement in India and South Africa. The effects of German competition were not yet making themselves felt, but German firms were taking good.premises in this country and organising for an attack.   From reports rpoeived, however, he doubted if the Germans could quote lower prices than ours as a commercial proposition.     At the same time they sometimes gave unaccountably cheap tenders: thus, in the case of a recent tender for Chile, his own firm had quoted  40,000, the lowest British tender, while a German firm secured the contract at  24,000.Shipping.SIR ALAN ANDERSON said that freights were slightly better, and laid-up tonnage somewhat less.     Freights now stood at a level 30$ higher than in 1920, and about 2Sf, higher than in 1913.He referred to a difficulty which our shipowners were encountering in Spain, namely the Spanish tonnage tax.   This in effect provided that shipowners of all countries, including Spain, should contribute to a fund of whioh the benefit went to Spanish shipowners.   Further, the Spanish Government had more recently made a requirement that every foreign ship which embarks Spanish passengers is to comply with all the regulations with which it would have to comply in order to carry passengers of the ship&apos;s own nationality.   Sinoe the Spanish passenger rules were of a very low standard, the practical effect of this was a serious discrimination against British vessels.   He proposed, however, to obtain confirmation of the facts, and would see Spanish representatives before the next meeting of the Council.Railways.Mr. BROOKE said that general traffic carried by the railways continued to show an improvement.     All the companies had made up a slight amount of leeway as compared with last year, especially in regard to pig iron, of which the carryings had increased by 25J&amp;.   In general, the heavy trades, so far as could be judged-by railway traffic statistics, seemed to be making progress.
CONFIDENTIAL. Railways.Sir HERBERT WALKER (by letter):-Prom reports which have come to hand, I am able to state that, apart from coal, coke and patent fuel, there is a tendenoy in the upward direction so far as the movement of general merchandise traffics are concerned.Textiles: Cotton.Mr. JUDSOE said that the position in the cotton trade was maintained.   In the American Section, which represented 70j  of the trade, hours had been increased to 39f per week; at the same time cotton was falling in price.     The latest estimates placed the American Cotton crop at 13f million bales.Unemployment figures were decreasing, since workpeople would cease to draw unemployment pay for short-time working.   There was a better feeling in Lancashire than there had been for three or four years past.   The only drawback was a shortage of young labour between 14 and 16 years of age; this resulted largely from the raising of the school age.COLONEL SEDDOH BROWN said he oould confirm Mr, Judson&apos;s remarks; the improvement had been very well maintained, though spinnerB and manufacturers&apos; order books were not quite so full now: this, however, was in part due to the fact that, owing to their better position, they were now asking a longer time for delivery.     The last of the Washington Bureau&apos;s crop reports was due to appear shortly, and buyers were probably holding off somewhat  ; till they had seen these.The improvement in business was mainly for export; the home market was still unsatisfactory, probably on account of .the low spending power of the public.The labour question was a serious one; they were finding the greatest difficulty in obtaining young labour,, though good pay was offered.   There was also a shortage of skilled labour for weaving.With regard to the statistics of the Egyptian cotton crop, to which he had referred at the previous meeting, Col. Seddon Brown Baid that he was having inquiries made in Egypt with a view to getting further information as to the facts.Textiles: Wool.. Ur. ANDREWS (by letter)s-The slight improvement in trade mentioned at the last meeting has continued.   I then reported that there was a good deal more confidence and assurance with regard to the future; this has been exemplified by the advance in the price of wool since that date. The merino qualities are now so high in price, and the cost of the .cloth so dear, that the tendency of the trade is to run on to coarser and more neglected qualities whioh were in price below what is considered to be a natural parity.No doubt this is also caused by the inability of the buying public to pay the very high prices for cloths of the finer qualities, and the demand is now for coarser cloth at a lower price.
h e) 3OOHFIJEHTIAL-Textiles: Wool.This is being reflected in the very high prices being paid for wool in New Zealand and will assure the New Zealand wool  rowers of a very excellent return for their present olip, and will no doubt further tend to improve trade in that Dominion.The Australian prices for the finer wools still remain at a very high level, and it is quite possible now that Australia may receive fully 80 million sterling for the present clip as against about 27 million pre-war.   This should also assist in the improvement of trade in Australia, and we hope will increase their demands for Textile goods.The actual improvement in machinery employment here is not very great.     Wooloombers are about the same - Spinners are a little better and Manufacturers are perhaps a little better employed in the Worsted trade, whilst Manufacturers in the Woollen trade are doing very well.     The reason why the Worsted trade is so much worse than the Woollen trade is again a question of prioe. The Woollen Manufacuurers can produce a cloth very much cheaper than the Worsted, beoause. in the Worsted trade only virgin wool can be used, whilst in the Woollen trade substitutes of different characters can be employed to cheapen the cloth.On the whole, the position is a little better than a fortnight ago.Textiles: Worsted, etc.Lr. SUTOLIFFE SUITE said that unemployment and short-time working had improved; foreign competition, however, remained severe in the home trade, and manufacturers were taking orders at cost, or even at a loss, in order to keep their   looms going.The sudden spurt of aotivity which had been shown a little while ago was now falling off, the   rise in prices having, perhaps, deterred buyers; only 55$  of looms were working, though if trE.de became good, a shortage of weavers would make itself felt.     Spindles were employed at only about 70f of their capacity.   Lerino spinning was slack, but mohairs were better.The South American market was fair, and trade with Egypt had improved, but Italian competition there was severe.     In India the rise in value of the Rupee had caused a temporary lull, but business was now better, though Italian competition was strong there also.   In China the political disturbances had resulted in textiles being held up at the ports, with the consequence of a heavy &apos;carry-over1.     A good season, however, might be looked for there, on aocount of the lack of stocks   up country.A steady stream of orders was being received from the Dominions.In reply to an inquiry by lir. Sutcliffe smith as to the position in regard to the new duties under the Greek Tariff, it was stated that inquiries would be made to find out exactly how matters now stood.Mr. SUTCLIFFB SliITK also referred to the Serbian law, fixingan arbitrary exchange for foreign payments at a very low rate.This law would have to be repealed if we were to do any businessthere.   Ee would send full particulars to the Department of Overseas Trade.
2b4CONFIDENTIAL.Non-Ferrous Metals.Mr. TAIT (by letter):-Copper.is still in satisfactory demand by praotioally all the consuming trades in the country, and, in particular, there is a heavy demand from the Cable industry.Tin.   The Works all seem to be fairly well booked with orders, and, although there is a lull in the demand at the moment it is not anticipated that there will be any set-back in the industry in the near future.Lead.   Consumption remains extraordinarily good; in all the manufacturing trades, and the demand for the metal is ahead of current supply.Spelter.   Consumption is good, and the galvanised iron trade has reoeived some satisfactory orders during the past month.Aluminium.   The demand is steady, particularly from the Motor industry, both for ingots and sheet metal.   There is also a growing demand in the Eleotrioal industry, and orders from India continue to be satisfactory.Mr. PERRY said that no marked change had taken place in the situation of the chemical industry sinoe Ihe last reported.   A point whioh oalled for mention, however, was the rumour of the floating of a large loam in the United States, by the German chemical trade combine known as the &quot;I.G.&quot;.   He would like to hear whether any confirmation could be obtained of this.   The President said that enquiries would be made.Mr. BIRLEY said that the rubber manufacturing industry had shown some falling off in November, but this wbb-seasonal, and probably the position was a little better than at the same time last year.   Manufacturers, however, viewed with concern  the working of the rubber output restriction soheme, which they held not to be in, consumers&apos; interests.   It was doubtful if an actual shortage could be avoided when prices risej low prices, on the other hand, meant greater consumption and more employment.The tyre manufacturers were hoping for legislative relief shortly.   A new wages agreement had just been concluded with the operatives in the rubber-manufacturing  industry embodying a sliding soale based on the cost of living: this was due to run for 12 months,The falling-off in trade was probably attributable in the main to foreign competition.   The competition from the United States was not severe as regards tyres, but in that line Italian and French competition was distinctly serious.   In the surgical branch German competition was much felt.   A movement was on foot to press for the compulsory marking of German goods.In reply to a question by the President as to the possibility of a shortage of rubber, Mr. Birley said that he did not consider the risk was Immediate, though it might become so if consumption continued to increase.   Under the scheme, if the price of rawChemicals.Rubber Manufactures.
CONFIDENTIAL. Rubber Manufactures.rubber was l/6d. per lb. an increase of output of 10$ was allowed; if l/3d., only 5$.   This was not a large allowance, as stocks were very low.   The average price for November had not been as high as l/6d.Fears were entertained as to what Amerioan buyers might do. Stooks were decreasing, while consumption increased owing to a general extension of the uses of rubber.   If the need for ha sudden increase in the output of plantations arose, difficulty would be likely to be enoountered in obtaining the necessary extra labour.Pottery.* Hr. HOLLINS remarked that it was somewhat difficult to give a comprehensive review of the pottery industry owing to the faot that it is divided into eight sections, concerned with different branches of the trade.   These included roofing and floor tiles, tiles of other descriptions, general earthenware, eleotrioal fittings, and the English china and stoneware trades.   As a whole, trade was fair, but varied from section to section.   The exports of general earthenware was well kept up, but the home market was quiet,   A good trade was being done in sanitary earthenware,   Slectrioal fittings and English china had, he thought, reached the rock bottom point early this year, and had sinoe shown an improvement.   Business in tiles was good,   English and Scottish earthenware, however, was not doing so well, probably owing to the competition of glass for jam jars and stone-ware bottles.   On the whole, trade was fair in the pottery industry, but imports from foreign countries of certain classes of goods were increasing.General Trade - Food Industries.Mrv MACHIN said that in the food industries, though there was not a boom, more confidence was being felt and more business done than for some years past.   Overseas markets were active.He would mention that numerous complaints had reached him on the subjeot of inter-allied indebtedness.   The Italians and the French were very active competitors in our markets, and British traders felt a keen sense of grievance at the faot that this was assisted by the failure on the part of Franoe and Italy to meet their indebtedness, and impose on themselves  . adequate taxation for this purpose.   This low taxation, oombined with low wages, was producing a rather serious effect.   Two of our largest food-preserving firms were taking steps to start faotories in France and Belgium, on the ground of the lower taxation and oosts.Co-operative Societies (sootland).Mr. GALLAGHER said that the business of the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale society again showed a slight decrease; but this was under 1$ for twenty-one weeks of the present year. The purchasing power of the public appeared to have slightly diminished, as a result of a rise in the prioe of commodities.
Oft-operative&apos; Societies (Scotland).Tho Scottish Co-operative Societies were largely dependent upon the Coal industry which, in Scotland,&apos; was still badly situated, owing to tho mild winter at home, and the bad state of export business.Referring to tho enquiry into Food Prices, Mr. Gallaoher remarked upon tho fluctuations which had recently taken place in the price of staple commodities&apos;&apos;for no apparent reason.   Thus, the prioe of Wheat had risen by 50$ during the last year; in October 1933 it stood at 40/f3 per quarter, while in October of this year it had risen to 65/- and in November to 67,/-.   Tho Canadian orop, it was true, was short, but.that in the United States was good, and should counter-balance this.   It seemed, however, that the market was being kept short by artificial moans.The price of Flour had not risen in the same ratio as that of Wheat, probably on account of the large flour stocks existing in the United States.   It was to be anticipated, however, that the rise in the price of Wheat would ultimately be reflected in that of Flour also.Marked increases had taken place in the prioe of Butter during last month, probably on account of Germany coming into the market.   The result was to throw the consumer on to the inferior grades.Sugar was not so much in demand; as oorapared&apos;with 1913, the production of Cane Sugar had risen by over      million tons, but that of Beet sugar had declined by about one million tons.There appeared to be a possibility of a world famine in Tea in the future.   India was now consuming one-third of her own production, while consumption in the United States had also much increased, and, but for the fact that Russia was out of the market, there would already be a marked shortage.   Cheese had shown a tendency to fall in price. A certain quantity coming from Canada was being sold at fixed wholesale and retail prices.   This was a new feature, and should help to control profits.The price of Irish haras was up by almost 25fi; that of bacon had not risen quite so much.   On tho other hand, prices for American hams were down by about 5):s.   The Irish hams were of the best quality, though during the war American ones had been largely used for lack of better.The President observed that the Royal Commission on Pood Prices was holding its first sitting on the 10th December, and in the meanwhile its members had already been supplied with much of tho material which was already available.Banking.MR. TISHNANT said that there was no particular change to report in the money markot.   There war still great demands in the short loan market, and a good many foreign and Colonial loans had boon made.   Deposits this month would
possibly be somewhat lower and advances somewhat increased. The sterling exchange on New York had on the previous day (Tuesday, Snd Deoember) reached its highest point (4.65) since April 1923.Hi3 Bank*s Branch reports on trade conditions generally went to confirm thoobservations made by the members of the Counoil. &apos; ii in reply to a question by Mr. Samuel as to how far he would attribute the strength of the New York exchange to speculation, to remittances under the Dawes Scheme, or to tho flow of United States capital via sterling into German industry, Mr. Tennant said that no doubt a large sentimental element entered into the case; also America, probably believing that conditions in Europe were improving, was making loans on a fairly large Koale.   There had been hopes that a rise of prices in the United States would help our exchange, but this had been counterbalanced by corresponding increases in prices in this country.   In effect, while the improvement might perhaps be attributable in some slight degree to artificial factors, it seemed likely that this improved tendency would be maintained, and It might further be assisted shortly by rises in prices in the United States.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE (by letter):-Report on Monetary Conditions during November 1984.There is no important change to report in the monetary situation, apart from a reduction in the &quot;Other Deposits&quot; of&quot; the Bank of England in the past month from about  3.13...000,000 to about  105,000,000.   In well-informed circles this is not regarded as heralding an upward movement in the Bank Rate in the near future.   It usually happens that just prior to the distribution of the  50,000,000&apos; of interest on War Loan that credit is contracted, in order that the supply shall not be too greatly increased after the distribution of the dividends.No;important change in the monetary situation is to be expected in the next month.   Most exchange dealers agree that the present level of the New York rate is higher than is warranted by the purchasing power of the   as compared with the dollar.   Nevertheless, America and the Continent are very bullish as to the prospects of sterling.   However this may be, there is no doubt that a much greater degree cf stability has been reached by the majority of the European exchanges.   For instance, in the past week no fewer than seventeen currencies, mostly European, showed no change on balance in sterling value.   As sterling remained firm in terms of gold dollars this means that seventeen currencies were firm In terms of gold.   The emphasis of this point is that not since 1914 has such a position been registered before.The conversion offer to holders of 5f- per cent. Exchequer Bonds has had a mixed reception, but a large proportion of the private holdings were converted within the first ten days.There are no other features of outstanding interest.
CONFIDENTIAL. Australian Trade.MR. SANDERSON said that during November there had been widespread rainfall in Australia of great value to pastoral and agricultural interests j prospeets for a good harvest - estimated at 130 million bushels - continued to be bright, and the outlook in Western Australia was greatly-improved.By 31st October over one million bales of Wool had been reoeived into brokers&apos; stores and about 400,000 bales sold.   The value of the total clip, estimated on the present basis, was 75 millions sterling.The season was very favourable for Butter production and the keenest interest was being shown in the adoption of the Commonwealth Government brand for choicest Butter; this had forced all factories to follow tho moat up-to-date. methods of manufacture and had made compulsory the use of pasteurisation.   Almost 80$ of the Butter shipped from Australia bore the Commonwealth brand.During the past five years, the area under Cotton cultivation had ri3en from 73 acres to 60,000 aores and the crop from 19 bales to over 9,500 bales:   90$ of ttiis came from Queensland.   Six ginneries had been erected and one Ootton-seed oil mill.   A factory had also been established for the manufacture of cotton fabrics.Arrangements were being made for the naniifuoturo in Australia of motor tears by the Ford Oompany.The Shipping strike was still in-progress; it took the form of the Unions refusing to work overtime.   Work was, however, proceeding within the normal hours on loading the majority of&quot;vessels; and the parties had been summoned to the Arbitration Court.Two Bills had lately been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament for regulating the exports and the marketing of Dried Jfruits and Dairy products.   Boards of Control were to be appointed, representing the Government, the growers or produoers and the commercial interests, but giving the growers or producers a majority representation: following the constitution of these Boards, they would appoint a London Agency.   Neither of these Aots would come into foroe until a majority of the growers or producers voted in their favour.As regards the new regulations on the subject of preference to British trade, the Commonwealth Ministry of Trade and Customs and the Tariff Board had expressed themselves as willing to do all they could to meet British views.The President said that, while we were anxious to comply with the spirit of tho new regulations, there seemed likely to be some practical difficulties in applying the requirement of 75$ British labour or materials, and he hoped to have an opportunity of discussing details with the representatives of the Commonwealth Government.
New Zealand Trade.Sill JAMBS ALLEiH said that   general prosperity continued&quot; in New Zealand.ETeotrioal development was proceeding rapidly.   The Hew Zealand Government had decided to Improve their railway services and to spend about  1,000,000 a year here for that purpose during the next three or four years.   Large orders for locomotives had been plaoed in this oountry ainoe June, and still more would be required.iIndian Trade.MR. LIHDSAY said that the statistics of Indian trade for six months, from April to September, showed an Inorease of Imports from  66,000,000 to  32,000,000.   Of this; however, the British share had dropped from 58% to 54$. Continental countries had been the principal ones to benefit, especially Germany and Belgium, who had increased their trade with India notably in Iron and steel goods.A slight increase had taken plaoe In India&apos;s export trade&apos;.   The United Kingdom had taken the Bame share during the last six months as in the previous six months.   There wab a distinct inorease in the trade with Italy and Egypt.The figures for iron and steel showed the first effects of the new proteotive policy in India.   Imports for the six months amounted to 423,000 tons, of which 152,000 . were proteoted, and the balanoe of some 270,000 not protected.   In other words, the proteotion did not apply to as much as 50$ of the imports of iron and steal, nor did it appear to have   affeoted Imports, since the figures ^423,000; tons were considerably above those for the similar six months last year and the year before.As regards cotton pieoe goods, the six-monthly figures showed that while in the corresponding period of 1922, 664,000,000 yards had been imported, and, of 1923, 720,000,000, In the six months of 1924 the imports amounted to 876,000,000 yards..   The British share in this trade had continued at 90^ throughout.   The Italians had, however, made a substantial advance in colour-printed and dyed goods.   Whereas during six months in 1922 their exports of these to India had amounted only to half a million yards, in the corresponding period of 1923 they had sent 2,000,000 yards and, of 1924, 4,000,000.   The Japanese had also inoreased their trade in grey goods and white good3j the British percentage, however, remained the same.South Amerioan Trade.MR.*i HOSE.   The Argentine had imported large quantities of goods early In 1923, on aoocunt of an increase in the tariff coming into foroe at the end of that yoarj they had now however, got rid of a good deal of the resulting surplus stock, and their buying was on the increase. Prospects for the future depended on their export trade. Their ooroal crops would not be very good this years the
OOKFIDBNTI AIi. South American Trade (0ontd.).Linseed crop would be only some 700,000 tons, as against 1-1- million tons last year.   The export of Wheat was estimated at 3g- to 3^ million tons as against 4j million last year: at tho same time, its price was considerably higher.   It was expected that the normal quantity of,Wool would be exported, at a considerably higher price.In Brazil, exports of Ooffoe had expanded, but political and financial conditions were not good, and until effect was given to the recommendations of the recent Financial Mission, an increased demand from that country could not be looked for.   The United Kingdom, however, took first place onoe more amongst importers into Brazil.In Chile the outlook was distinctly &apos;..good; the coup d&apos;etat there might be regarded from some points of view as not unsatisfactory as it seemed clear that unconstitutional, methods of government would not be followed.   Go 3d prices were being secured for nitrates.   Demand from Chile for our products should bo normal, or above the normal.In these South American countries, British goods were preferred, even at slightly higher pri cos.   But they had recently adopted a number of measures of an economic character in regard to foreign banking and exchange, which gave some cause for concern, in that they tended to discriminate against foreigners.   The situation was not at present serious, but would need careful watching.   In one Instance In Chile, he understood a law had been passed providing for the distribution of a share of firms&apos;&apos; profits to their employees.   So far as he knew, the lav; in question had not yet been promulgated.As regards the removal of the disabilities placed upon German banking in this country, Mr. Hose observed that the activities of the German banks in London were not competitive with British banks in the United Kingdom, or in Empire countries, but affected those banking houses ifcLch do business principally in foreign countries. Large numbers of German banks had been established in South America,&apos; during the war they had lost many of their connections, but had increased their capital, as their assets were in gold equivalents, while their liabilities were in Marks.   He did not think,1 however, that the removal of restrictions on German banking In London would be detrimental to British banking enterprise abroadj he was in favour of the largest possible measure of freedom. In France, and some other foreign countries, we had experienced some trouble through restrictions on foreign banking.Chinese Trade.Mft*tLAHDALB   said that the position in China remained.ned*&quot;mach as, it had been during the previous month. Till a stable government was established, no general improvement in trade could be looked for.   The situation in Shanghai had quieted down, though some troops were still stationed there.   Stocks of imported goods were
OONfT D 33n.TI AL. Chinos o Trade (Oontd.).low, and business would become brisk if a political settlement could be reached.   British textiles, however, were still too dear, and the low Japanese exchange assisted exports from Japan to China,   We were also feeling the effect of the subsidised competition of Japanese shipping.With regard to the question of trade marks in China, the only new&apos; development whioh had taken place waa tho issue by the Canton Government of a law similar to that of the Peking Government, requiring registration of trade marks in Canton also.   This went, ho thought, to confirm the view maintained by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that compliance with the Peking law would provide no safeguard for British traders.j^r. Sutcllffe Smith observed that a large number of merchants in this country were now registering their marks in China, in view of the fact that the special privileges for registering marks of five years1 standing lapse on 3lst December next: British merchants in China, however, were not. registering.Proceeding, Mr, Landale observed that a large part, of China remained peaceful, though increasingly large strategetio areas were being occupied by the military.   It was becoming more difficult to collect money for engineering and railway material,Unemployment Statistics (Ministry of Labour).M3A, PHILLIPS said that, from the point of view of the Ministry of labour, there was no special new feature to . report.   General unemployment figures had, however, been declining somewhat during the last two or three weeks, and it seemed likely that they would continue to do so till the end of the year&quot;, as had happened last year.   Since August or September trie coal trade had swelled the figures of unemployment, but, judging purely from the moat recent figures of registered unemployed the position of that industry now seemed to be improving.

CONFIDENTIALB. STATEMENT REGARDING THE EXPORT TRADE POSITION MADE AT THE MEETING Of THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE DEPARTMENT OS1 OVERSEAS TRADE on the 19th NOVEMBER, 1984*I!COTTON TRADE.Mr. Kenneth lee stated that the situation in the American Section of the cotton trade hail recently undergone much improvement, from the 23rd February up to the 3rd November the working week haci, been 26-1- hours in this section; from the 3rd November 32 houss wsre being worked, and it was expected that 39f hours would be reached as from 1st December.   lam prices were infinitely better recently. Raw cotton prices were now much lower than last year, the fall being from 19^, November 1923, to just over 13-1, November 1924-.   The m&amp;r-gin of profit was decidedly better, as short time by agreement and consequent lowered production, had worked out satisfactorily in the long run.   It was expected that prices for finished goods would rise in the near future0Enquiries were made about cotton supplies, especially from Argentina, but Mr. Kenneth Lee stated that the only outlook for greatly increased supplies was from Uganda, which was now exporting 120,000 bales with the hope that 300/400,000 bales might be reached in a few years0FISHERIES.Sir Herbert Morgan referred to the extraordinarily good season which the herring trade had experienced.   The situation at present was that the demand was practically unlimited, with high prices ruling,SOAP &amp; ALLIED TRADES.. i    The sale for proprietary goods and other articles in these branches was regarded by Sir Herbert Morgan a3 satisfactory, and the demand at present continued strong,FINANCE &amp; BANKING,,Mr, Goo&amp;enough was of opinion that at the moment there was considerably more confidence in the financial world., which was a first essential to any improvement in trade.   This confidence was increasing the purchasing power in most foreign markets.   He was able to confirm Mr. Kenneth lee1!:; remarks in regard to the cotton trade and he had also been informed that orders were now coming IS. more freely from India and elsewhere In tho iron and steel trades. Speaking generally, &amp; greater volume of trade bills was being handled through the banks.   If th6 expected financial Improvement on the Continent proceeded further, the outlook might be expeoted to brighten accordingly.   Conditions in America had improved since the Presidential Election, and money which for some time had been a drug-there was now in considerably better demand,,HEAVY WOOLLEN TRADE,Sir Algernon Firth stated that he could record no very great improvement &quot;as yet, although he agreed, that there was a greater/feeling
fr 0: i. -J *OOMFEDEHPIAI.feeling of confidence.   There were signs, that merchants: were piactsg orders which had been hitherto purposely held back.   The prices at which orders were at present being taken could not be considered profitable and buyers were well aware that advances in prices were likely to take place before lorfg, end were accordingly taking the opportunity of getting into the market at the low prices at present rullngaIRON AM) STEEL TRADE. IMr, Hlohens recorded some slight improvement in the iron and steel trades, but he regretted that the improvement had not been maintained as f&amp;r as Sheffield is concerned.   It was not profitable to manufacture at the present prices, but, nevertheless, competition from abroad was such that prices could not be raised,, He quoted as an example a contract which recently went to Germany at a price which would only have covered cost of material in Sheffield.In reply to an enquiry as to whether the German iron and steel trade was receiving any subsidy, Mr. Hiohens gave it as his opinion that no direct subsidy was being paid, but that low rent and wages, together with long hours, acted virtually as an indirect subsidy and enabled the Germans to undercut prices,Mr. Bond, speaking for the iron and steel trade, was unable to record any very great improvement.   It was true that the prices of Continental products had recently shown increases, but so far the difference was not sufficient to enable foreign competition to be met ty this country.   He had been informed from an unexceptionable source that Germany was selling iron and steel goods at a loss, and that no change of this policy could be expected until international agreements regarding price3 were reachede   The suggestion was made that the world1s production of iron and steel goods was excessive, owing to the increased capacity brought about during the war-time demand for munitions, but it was agreed after discussion that had the normal demand increased in a ratio to that of pre-war years, &quot;the present output capacity would not exceed the world1s demands.   It was expected that in the course of a few years, consumption would overtake the increased -capacity of production, but in the meantime a period during which international price agreements would be the rule,i would haye to elapse.The sheet and tinplate industries had been doing very well, but they appeared to be specially favoured by fortune, and at the moment the demand showed some signs of falling off.   The excessive cost of fuel was understood to be the greatest handicap from which the iron and steel trade was at present suffering, it being the fact that the price of the industrial coal at the pit-head in Germany averaged&quot; 14/&apos;- par ton as against 21/- to 22/-. per ton in Great Britain.SEIPB OTIiDXffGr.   :Mr. lichens stated that little or no improvement could be seen in the shipbuilding Trade,   The industry was mainly in a state of hopeful expectation,, there being no indication of any brisk supply of orders for fresh tonnage.OJVOSjI TRAlffigColonel Willey said that the woollen trade was getting a fair share of the general improvement in export, but that the/ inoics3a.es
OOEgllMTIAl.incidence of the increased business was vary varied.   Matters were bad in trie blanket and rug trade; in hosiery all was well; the Scotch tweed trade was in a bad condition; the worsted trade was fair, except in goods of the highest class, which were suffering from lack of demand.   The trade faced such competition as it met abroad satisfactorily, but in tho home market French competition had established a position which was serious and very much resented.   Ho regretted to see the tendency of the escort trad&apos;:; to run into the groove of,,semi-manufactured articles, the drop in fully manufactured articles being decidedly dla-qu^ing.   There was not sufficient employment at the moment to i$ejt&quot;^agli^aery, particularly looms, in full naming.   There had been a rapid rise in the price of wool, and it was shortly going to be a question where   purchasers, at the high prices which are in prospect, were to be found.   His summary of the situation was that for some time past the raw material end of the woollen trade had been profitable, whereas manufacturing had not been so. At the moment our exports of woollen machinery were increasing, a faot which foreshadowed early fresh competition from abroad,ElEOTHIOAli IHDUSJST,Mr, Pybus considered that the electrical engineering trade was one of the mast fortunate branches at the present time, especially in tho heavy and medium sections of&apos; the trade. The present increased output was practically entirely absorbed by the export trade, the home trade showing little or no life. In tenders for contracts the strongest competition waa from American quarters, this being attributed to the fact that the American industry was somewhat narvious about losing, its markets anti was at the present time selling at unduly low prices.   He anticipated that at an early flate renewed competition from Germany would become evident,Tho trade in light electrical goods, which comprised wireless apparatus, was showing a steady and healthy growth.   The electrical trade generally was hoping for good results from the enquiry which was initiated by the late Government into methods of distribution of power, light, etc., especially in urban and country districts, and he hoped that the present G,.vorn;::ent would pursue the efforts already initiated,HEW ZBA.LAMD.Mr, Willis referred to the present prosperous condition of trade in Hew Sealand, and added that the outlook for at least a couple of years to come sropeared to be satisfactory.   The financial situation had been affected by monetary conditions in Australia which appeared to him to be on the eve of remedy owinf? to the passing of the new federal Bill,OHTEA MSKQOAHT TEAKS.Mr, Lodwoll was unable to give a good account of trade with China,   Ho had been asked by the leading China merchants to put the present state of affairs in what they considered its proper perspective-, before the Chairman,   The effect of the present civil war was becoming disastrous, and the China Merchants&apos; Association considered that His Majesty1s Government would do well to initiate a joint movement with other powers for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear upon China;   He added that it must be admitted that the figure of imports into China had not&apos;: /decreased
QOIIJgLI-SITOIAL,Moreased in recent months, but it was, nevertheless, a faot that goods -were not going out of European merchants warehouses in China s at all freely, and that this stagnation appeared likely to continue until times were quieter and confldenoe was restored,   The Association considered that owing to politioal inaotlon the prestige of Great Britain had been considerably diminished in China, which was inolined to&apos;play fast and loose with treaty obligations of various kinds.The Chairman promised that.he and Sir William&apos;Clark would consult the foreign Office on the general question,INDIA.Sir Charles Moleod informed the Committee that the monsoon in India had been very good, with a resultant excellent harvest of all crops.   The natural&quot;consequence was that buyers in general were in a good mood,   Trices of Indian products - jute, hemp, seeds and wheat - were all high, and the tea trade was ex-extremely prosperous.   His information went to show that stocks of imported goods in the Basaars had been exceptionally light for some time past, and that the expectations were in favour of heavy buying,   India1 s exports of wheat were improving,,   The notable industrial expansion in India was likely to have its reflex here in satisfactory purchases of machinery etc.The cotton piece-goods market in India at the present time was stated to be in a good condition for fresh purchases, as the heavy unsold stocks which for some years past had proved an * obstruction to further trade, had now been virtually cleared out,India was.at the present moment importing exceptional quantities of gold and, provided the political situation improved, there was more reason to look for encouragement in&apos; the trading situation than there had been for some time past,EAST AFRICA,Sir Charles Moleod referred to East Africa, where improved prices for&apos;produoe, mainly sisal and maize, had   effected a revolution,,   The expansion of the cotton export trade was remarkable,   In 1904, when the trade made a beginning, only  0,000 lbs, of cotton were exported from East Africa,   During the present vear 127*000 bales of 400 lbs, each had been exported, -and it was hoped that a figure of 160/190,000 bales would be reached next year*EXPORT CREDITS,Colonel Peel stated that the activity of the export credits scheme, as would be seen by the figures placed&apos;before the Committee, had not been very great during recent months.   He was of opinion that the ordinary credit channels, i.e, banks and insurance companies, were taking up almost all the sound business offered, and that to a large extent only business of a rather doubtful order was being offered to the Export Credits Department,q  * n
