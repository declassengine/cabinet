in(THIS DGOUMMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHIMHIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYiffiiSMlHT) O.B. 525.j24i.*&quot;* &apos; 0 A B: I M jB f /AJHGLQ-ORfiEK COMMERCIAL TREATY-Memorandum by the Secretary ofState.for..the colonies. (Previous Paper - CP. 515(24))His Majesty1s Government undertook at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923 &quot;to offer free admission to Empire currants and to consider what increase in the-duty on foreign currants may be neoessary to make the preference effective, such increase to come into force at a future date to be agreed upon&quot;.   The reason for postponing the date was that the development in the production of Empire ou.rrants is not at present sufficient to meet more than a small portion of the demand and that an immediate raising of the foreign duty might therefore affect prices adversely to the consumer.   To get over that objection it is neoessary that tho date should be fixed sufficiently far ahead to allow for currant bushes to be planted and bear fruit, a matter of several years. But it Is equally necessary that the date, and the future duty, should be fixed now, by a definite agreement between the Governments concerned, so that the expansion of the area under currants in Australia and South Africa should begin at once.The President of the Board of Trade proposes, in order to make sure of securing favourablo terms in the Anglo-Greek Commercial Treaty now being negotiated, to give an undertaking not to raise the currant duty above 2s. per cwt., in return for certain definite concessions
to British trade, the special article embodying these provisions to be subject to denunciation at six months notice.This proposal will, I am afraid, Bo regarded in the Dominions concerned, who attach great importance to the development of their currant trade, as a repudiation of our pledge in this matter.   They will naturally feel that once having secured specific advantages from Greece in return for the currant concession, we shall find it extremely difficult at any given moment to change our policy.   Still more important is the fact that the denunciation-ciation of the clause being a matter of complete uncertainty they cannot proceed upon the expansion of their current crop as they would if they knew definitely what ou.r policy would be.This is a matter of practical business as well as of obligation-.   The trade with Australia alone is wortn abdut twelve times that with Greece and has far greater possibilities of expansion.   It also has even greater possibilities of con-traction.   The moment Australia decided that we were not making a genuine attempt to p^ay up over preference, and began reducing her preferences or even applying her regulations unsympatbte-tically, we should suffer far more than by the absence of a treaty with Greece.I would therefore urge very strongly that the President of the Board of Trade should modify his proposal in the following sense:   to give the undertaking to Greece as to leaving the currant duty at 2s, for a given term of yesr^i only, soy three or four, after which time we should be free to raise the duty to a fixed amount not exceeding, say. the present raisin duty.   That would give the Greeks a definite instead of an indefinite concession, but enable us to
negotiate directly.with Australia and South Afrioa as to the precise date and future rato of the increased duty, and so enable them to make arrangements to open up new land under currant cultivation, and incidentally to tako on a corresponding number of new settlers.I ought to add that the alternative I suggest would also be the one best calculated to bring down prices to the Consumer,   It would at once stimulate tho conditions for a larger supply in the future.   When that supply comes into the market it would create so effective a competition with Greece that the Greeks would find themselves obliged to lower their export tax on currants,   for their present quasi-monopoly is such that they actually levy a 5s. export tax on currants, and yet have the face to ask us not to raise our duty.   The British consumer, in fact, is taxed 7s. on his currants, of which the Greek Exchequer gets 5s. and the British Exchequer only 2s.   Raising the duty by 5s. in future would, with the extra stimulus of Umpire competition, probably force the Greeks to drop their export tax altogether. The British Exchequer would then get the whole tax on the foreign import and the British consumer would get the benefit of really effective competition from tax-free Empire currants..L.S.A.)Colonial Office,4th December, 1924.
