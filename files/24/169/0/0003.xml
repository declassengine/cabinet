Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,With reference to the two memoranda on Sugar Beet, which have already been circulated [CP, 483 and C,P. 466] and to the Cabinet&apos;s decision on 12th instant [Cabinet 59 (24) Conclusion 3 (o) and (d)3 I now circulate a draft Bill to implement the proposals of the late Government for subsidising the produc-tion of sugar from home grown beet, which I hope the Home Affairs Committee will authorise me to introduce as soon as Parliament meets *I also desire the authority of the Committee to make a public announcement of the proposals contained in the draft Bill at the earliest possible moment as it is important to set at rest without delay any uncertainty as to the Government^ intentions.The Clause in the Bill relating to machinery, has been drawn so as to include a power to dispense with the condition suggested in paragraph 6 of C,P, 486 that 75$ of the cost of machinery required at any new factory must be spent in this country,     I find that in the case of one factory at least it will be impossible to enforce the proposed requirement as to the proportion of mechinery of British manufacture, as definite commitments have been made which cannot be varied.
